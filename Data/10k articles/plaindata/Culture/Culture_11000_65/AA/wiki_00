{"id": "13329292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13329292", "title": "Anti-humor", "text": "Anti-humor\n\nAnti-humor is a type of indirect humor that involves the joke-teller delivering something which is intentionally not funny, or lacking in intrinsic meaning. The practice relies on the expectation on the part of the audience of something humorous, and when this does not happen, the irony itself is of comedic value. Anti-humor is also the basis of various types of pranks and hoaxes.\n\nThe humor of such jokes is based on the surprise factor of absence of an expected joke or of a punch line in a narration which is set up as a joke. This kind of anticlimax is similar to that of the shaggy dog story. In fact, some researchers see the \"shaggy dog story\" as a type of anti-joke.\n\nThe shaggy dog story involves telling an extremely long joke with an intricate (and sometimes horribly grisly) back story and surreal or repetitive plotline, before ending the story with either a weak spoonerism, or abruptly stopping with no real punchline at all.\n\nAnother type of anti-joke gives a suggestion of building to a (typically risqué) punchline, but breaks the audience's anticipation by swerving to a non-risqué punchline or no punchline at all: \"Did you hear about the honeymooners who confused the tube of K-Y Jelly with window putty? Quite the tragedy, all the windows fell out of their new home.\"\n\nOne more type of anti-humor is found in the joke \"No soap radio\". The joke is meant to have no punch line. When someone tells the joke, it is most likely with their friends, and it is meant to confuse others who don't know that there isn't supposed to be a joke.\n\nAlternative comedy, among its other aspects, parodies the traditional idea of the joke as a form of humor. Anti-humor jokes are also often associated with deliberately bad stand-up comedians. One very successful stand-up comedian, Andy Kaufman, had his own unique brand of anti-humor, quasi-surrealist acts coupled with performance art; one of his best-known manifestations of this was his act as Tony Clifton, a painfully untalented lounge lizard entertainer. Norm Macdonald is another comedian sometimes associated with performing anti-humor, although he objected to the characterization.\n\n"}

It applies to the body and not to a mental state, but the arrangement of the body is presumed to serve a communicative or expressive purpose. An example of a conventional attitude in art is proskynesis to indicate submissive respect toward God, emperors, clerics of high status, and religious icons; in Byzantine art, it is particularly characteristic in depictions of the emperor paying homage to Christ. In 20th- and 21st-century art history, \"attitude\" is used most often to label one of these conventional postures; another example is the orans pose.\n\n\"Attitude\" was arguably more important as an aesthetic term in the 19th century, when it was defined in one art-related dictionary as\n\nthe posture or disposition of the limbs and members of a figure, by which we discover the action in which it is engaged, and the very sentiment supposed to be in the mind of the person represented. It comprehends all the motions of the body, and requires a perfect knowledge of ponderation, and whatever refers to the centre of gravity; but whatsoever attitude be given to any figure, that attitude must show the beautiful parts, as much as the subject will permit, let the subject be what it will. It must, besides, have such a turn as, without departing from probability, or from the character of the figure, may diffuse a beauty over the action. It is allowed that the choice of fine attitudes constitutes the greatest part of the beauties of grouping.\n"}

{"id": "10969154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10969154", "title": "Bildung", "text": "Bildung\n\nBildung (, \"\"education, formation, etc.\"\") refers to the German tradition of self-cultivation (as related to the German for: creation, image, shape), wherein philosophy and education are linked in a manner that refers to a process of both personal and cultural maturation. This maturation is described as a harmonization of the individual's mind and heart and in a unification of selfhood and identity within the broader society, as evidenced with the literary tradition of \"Bildungsroman\".\n\nIn this sense, the process of harmonization of mind, heart, selfhood and identity is achieved through personal transformation, which presents a challenge to the individual's accepted beliefs. In Hegel's writings, the challenge of personal growth often involves an agonizing alienation from one's \"natural consciousness\" that leads to a reunification and development of the self. Similarly, although social unity requires well-formed institutions, it also requires a diversity of individuals with the freedom (in the positive sense of the term) to develop a wide-variety of talents and abilities and this requires personal agency. However, rather than an end state, both individual and social unification is a process that is driven by unrelenting negations.\n\nIn this sense, education involves the shaping of the human being with regard to his/her own humanity as well as his/her innate intellectual skills. So, the term refers a process of becoming that can be related to a process of becoming within Existentialism.\n\nThe term \"Bildung\" also corresponds to the Humboldtian model of higher education from the work of Prussian philosopher and educational administrator Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835). Thus, in this context, the concept of education becomes a lifelong process of human development, rather than mere training in gaining certain external knowledge or skills. Such training in skills is known by the German words \"Erziehung\", and \"Ausbildung\". \"Bildung\" in contrast is seen as a process wherein an individual's spiritual and cultural sensibilities as well as life, personal and social skills are in process of continual expansion and growth. Bildung is seen as a way to become more free due to higher self-reflection. Von Humboldt wrote with respect to \"Bildung\" in 1793/1794: \"Education [\"Bildung\"], truth and virtue\" must be disseminated to such an extent that the \"concept of mankind\" takes on a great and dignified form in each individual (GS, I, p. 284). However, this shall be achieved personally by each individual, who must \"absorb the great mass of material offered to him by the world around him and by his inner existence, using all the possibilities of his receptiveness; he must then reshape that material with all the energies of his own activity and appropriate it to himself so as to create an interaction between his own personality and nature in a most general, active and harmonious form\".Most explicitly in Hegel's writings, the \"Bildung\" tradition rejects the pre-Kantian metaphysics of being for a post-Kantian metaphysics of experience that rejects universal narratives. Much of Hegel's writings were about the nature of education (both \"Bildung\" and \"Erziehung\"), reflecting his own role as a teacher and administrator in German secondary schools, and in his more general writings.\nA more contemporary view was developed by Tony Waters: \"Bildung\", I discovered in my 2 years in Germany, is an organizing cultural principle for German higher education that trumps both careerism and disciplinary silos. It is generally translated as \"education\", but in fact it means more—dictionary definitions often refer to \"self-cultivation\", \"philosophy\", \"personal and cultural maturation\" and even \"existentialism\". Bildung is the cry of the land of poets and thinkers against the demands of credentialism, professionalism, careerism and the financial temptations dangled to graduating students.In this way, fulfillment is achieved through practical activity that promotes the development of one's own individual talents and abilities which in turn lead to the development of one's society. In this way, Bildung does not simply accept the socio-political status quo, but rather it includes the ability to engage in a critique of one's society, and to ultimately challenge the society to actualize its own highest ideals.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7520313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7520313", "title": "Cultural-historical psychology", "text": "Cultural-historical psychology\n\nCultural-historical psychology is a branch of psychological theory and practice associated with Lev Vygotsky and Alexander Luria and their Circle, who initiated it in the mid-1920s-1930s. The phrase \"cultural-historical psychology\" never occurs in the writings of Vygotsky, and was subsequently ascribed to him by his critics and followers alike, yet it is under this title that this intellectual movement is now widely known. The main goal of Vygotsky-Luria project was the establishment of a \"new psychology\" that would account for the inseparable unity of mind, brain and culture in their development (and/or degradation) in concrete socio-historical settings (in case of individuals) and throughout the history of humankind as socio-biological species.\n\nLev Vygotsky, born in Orsha, Russia (now in Belarus) in 1896, was a psychologist who contributed mostly to developmental psychology.\n\nVygotsky posed that in a social environment, children develop higher cognitive functions in practical activities. His theories were controversial in the Soviet Union and they remained virtually unknown, although introduced into the Western world in the 1930s, until the 1970s. This is when they became a pivotal point in models built in developmental and educational psychology. Although many current scholars do not agree with his theories or agree about what he meant, the 21st century has brought about scholarly reevaluations of many of the important aspects of these theories.\n\nAlexander Luria was a neuropsychologist and developmental psychologist. Together with Vygotsky, he helped create cultural-historical psychology and was a leader of the Vygotsky Circle. Separate to his work with Vygotsky, Luria is known for his case studies \"The Mind of a Mnemonist\", about a man with a highly advanced memory, and \"The Man with a Shattered World\", about a man with traumatic brain injury.\n\nCultural-historical psychology never existed as such during Vygotsky's lifetime. He never accomplished a developmental theory of his own and, by his own admission, died at the threshold of a new psychological theory of consciousness.\n\nVygotsky believed in the \"new man\" that he referred to as a \"superman\" of the future Communist society and advocated for a psychological theory that would account for the development from the actual level of human development to the potential one of a \"superman\". To that end, he claimed that the development of \"higher psychological functions\" are a result of the impact of parents, caregivers, peers and the culture at large. In one of his unfinished and abandoned manuscripts that was never published during his lifetime Vygotsky speculated that Every function in the child's cultural development appears twice: first, on the social level, and later, on the individual level; first, between people (interpsychological) and then inside the child (intrapsychological). This applies equally to voluntary attention, to logical memory, and to the formation of concepts. All the high functions originate as actual relationships between individuals.This idea was well known at least fifty years before Vygotsky, was advocated for by a number of other psychologists, and is known under the label of \"sociogenesis\". The post-Vygotskian tradition focuses, thus, not only on individual learning and the influences adults and peers have on learning, but also on how cultural beliefs and attitudes affect instruction and learning.\n\nIn contradistinction to Freud's and Freudian \"depth psychology\" and the behaviorists (and many others) \"surface psychologies\" of the average people in their everyday environment, Vygotsky postulated \"peak psychology\" of his own, which would focus on the highest, \"peak\" performance of people in their actual life and potential, future \"superman\" capacity. This \"peak psychology\" was never accomplished and largely remained an interesting and promising, yet utopian scientific project of considerable interest in the contemporary context of 21st century psychological research.\n\nThe larger project of the new psychology of Vygotsky and Luria failed, and no universal integrative theory of human mind and development was built by the time of Vygotsky's death in 1934 or, for that matter, ever after. However, the earlier intellectual effort and the legacy of the Soviet scholars of the 1920s-1930s was not entirely wasted and later developed in a range of special—typically, loosely related—fields of psychological theory and practice such as cultural and child psychology and education (most notably, in the subfields of dynamic assessment (including the vague idea of the zone of proximal development, the ZPD) and the so-called \"developmental education\"), neuropsychology, or psycholinguistics. Other notable areas of theory and practice that are in the dialogue with the cultural-historical tradition of Vygotsky and Luria are psychotherapy, theory of art, \"dialogical science\", cognitive science, semiotics and, in the words of Oliver Sacks, somewhat vague perspective, mindset and philosophy of \"romantic science\".\n\nThe major influences on cultural-historical psychology were the mechanist neurophysiology of Ivan Pavlov and Vladimir Bekhterev (during the so-called \"instrumental period\" of the 1920s), philosophy of language and culture of Wilhelm von Humboldt and his followers, socio-economic philosophy of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and, primarily, holistic German-American Gestalt psychology—specifically, the works of Max Wertheimer and Kurt Lewin. The holism of the German-American Gestaltists gradually became the dominant theoretical framework of cultural-historical psychology of Vygotsky and Luria in the 1930s and virtually totally eradicated Vygotsky's physiological mechanism and reductionism of the 1920s.\n\nA few of these earlier influences were subsequently downplayed, misunderstood or even totally ignored and forgotten. Thus, cultural-historical psychology understood as the Vygotsky-Luria project, originally intended by its creators as an integrative and, later, holistic \"new psychology\" of socio-biological and cultural development should not be confused with later self-proclaimed \"Vygotskian\" theories and fields of studies, ignorant of the historical roots and the intended breadth and depth of the original proposal and its consistent emphasis on the need in a new theory of consciousness. These include such as \"sociocultural psychology\", \"socio-historical psychology\", \"activity theory\", \"cultural psychology\", or \"cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT)\".\n\nVygotsky and Luria informally collaborated with other psychologists, educationalists, medical specialists, physiologists, and neuroscientists. The foundation of the integrative science of the mind, brain, and behavior in their bio-social development, was the main work of the Circle. They incorporated ideas of social and interpersonal relations, the practices of empirical scientific research, and \"Stalinist science\" founded on the discursive practices of Soviet science in the 1930s. There were around three dozen people involved in the research for Vygotsky's theory, at different periods of time.\n\nIn 1924, the Circle was formed in Moscow after Vygotsky moved there from Gomel, Belarus. At the Institute of Psychology he met Zankov, Solv'ev, Sakharov, and Varshava, as well as Alexander Luria, with whom he would go on to collaborate with.\n\nThe group grew at a gradual rate and all research was conducted in Moscow, Kharhov, and Liningrad, located in the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union was invaded by Germany during the Great Patriotic War (1941), the group disbanded and any further post-Vygotskian research after the beginning of World War II, was conducted by Luria, Leontiev, Zankov, and Elkonin.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32227770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32227770", "title": "Culture of Kathmandu", "text": "Culture of Kathmandu\n\nThe ancient and refined traditional culture of Kathmandu, for that matter in the whole of Nepal, is an uninterrupted and exceptional meeting of the Hindu and Buddhist ethos practiced by its highly religious people. It has also embraced in its fold the cultural diversity provided by the other religions such as Jainism, Islam and Christianity.\n\nThe ancient trade route between India and Tibet that passed through Kathmandu enabled fusion of artistic and architectural traditions of other cultures to be amalgamated with local architectural and artistic culture.\n\nThe City Core has most of the remarkable cultural wealth that evolved during the reign of the Malla kings between 15th and 18th centuries. The city was filled with sculptures, pagodas, stupas and palace buildings of exceptional beauty. There are also 106 monastic courtyards (known as baha or bahi) known for their art and piety. The level of skill of the local artisans are the exquisite wood carving, stone carving, metal casting, weaving, pottery and other crafts. The finest wood carvings are seen on the ornate windows of old buildings and on the roof struts of temples. Carving skills of the local artisans are seen at every street corner in the form of images of gods and goddesses and sunken water spouts.\n\nKathmandu valley has been described as \"an enormous treasure house of art and sculptures\". These treasures are made of wood, stone, metal and terracotta, and found in profusion in various temples, shrines, stupas, gompas, chaityas and palaces. The art objects are also seen in street corners, lanes, private courtyards and in open ground; mostly in the form of icons of gods and goddesses. Kathmandu valley has been the repositary of all this art treasure for a long time but it got a worldwide exposure only after the country opened its doors to the outside world in 1950.\n\nThe religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular is iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as: the Bhavani, Durga, Gaja -Lakshmi, Hariti-Sitala, Mahsishamardini, Saptamatrika (seven mother goddesses) and Sri-Lakshmi. From the 3rd century BC, apart from the Hindu Gods and Goddesses, Buddhist monuments from the Ashokan period (it is said that Ashoka visited Nepal in 250 BC) have also embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular. These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution namely, the Licchavi or classical period (500 to 900 AD) with motivation from the Gupta period in India; the post-classical period (1000 to 1400 AD) with strong influence of the Palla art form that extended to Tibet as well; and of the Malla period (1400 onwards) that exhibited explicitly tantric influences coupled with the demonic art of the Tibetan Demonology.\n\nA broad typology has been ascribed to the decorative designs and impressive carvings created by the creative and artistic people of Nepal, who have maintained a perfect blend of the two religious faiths of Hinduism and Buddhism. This typology based on the type of material used in the art forms is five in number. These are: the Stone Art, the Metal Art; the Wood Art; the Terracotta Art; and the Painting. These are briefly elaborated.\n\nIn the earliest times, at the dawn of civilization, stone heaps (made of boulders, pebbles etc.) were worshipped in Nepal, which is seen at several locations. The first real stone carvings started under the influence of the Mathura Art of India; some of these carvings are seen in the Pashupathinath temple complex. Later in mid 5th century AD Nepal Art evolved under the Ikshvaku, Gupta, Pala and Deccan Schools of Art forms. But the Nepalese sculptors improved on these forms which provide a typical style of Nepal.\n\n\nMetal images made of ashtadhatu (amalgam of eight metals) are common in Nepal and Indi, under both Hindu and Buddhist religious traditions. During the Licchavi period bronze in solid form was widely used for casting metallic sculptures; mostly between the seventh and eight centuries. But in the Medieval period Pala influence evolved into a distinct form. These can be seen in the form of large royal figures fixed on top of pillars in Durbar Squares of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur. Smaller and hollow cast bronze statues were made as icons for worship. In Tiebtan metal work, a hole was left in the bronze statues for filling with mantras written on paper or filling with offering of grains, precious stones or miniature icons. But the hole was sealed with copper in the presence of a Lama before formal consecration of the image. Here again there are two forms- one of Gods and Goddesses of Mahayana school in Pala art form and the other iconography inspiration of the Shamanic practice of Tibetan Demonology.\n\nIt is the traditional architecture in the Kathmandu valley in temples, palaces, monasteries and houses a perfected Neawri art form generally carved very artistically out of Sal (Shorea), teak (agarth), deodar (cedrus) and Sisso (dalbegia). Malla Kings patronized this art form from 12th century onwards. Its life span is affected by mild climate, linches, mosses, insects, borers, dry rots and biochemical defects. In the 14th century earthquake many of the wooden monuments were destroyed.\n\nTera cotta art in Nepal is traced to the 300 BC. It was perfected between 16th and 18th centuries Archeological excavations have unearthed hand-pressed moulds at Dhum Varahi at the fringes of Kathmandu, which are preserved in the museums in Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur. The male and female figures decorated in bands around temples, called Nagabands were made of terra cotta. Other fine examples of terra cotta art mentioned are Mahabuddha and Mayadevi temples in Patan and gateway of the Teleju temple in Hanumandhoka complex. Clay is the basic ingredient of this art form .\n\nPaintings are categorized under two broad head namely the religious and the non-religious. The religious category is further subdivided into three forms of painted manuscripts, Thangkas or Paubhas and Pattas (banners) or metal strips.\n\nKathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries, including the National Museum of Nepal and the Natural History Museum of Nepal.\nNepals’s art and architecture is a dazzling display from medieval to the present, which is a heady amalgamation of two of the ancient and greatest religions of the world – Hinduism and Buddhhism. These are amply reflected not only in the many temples, shrines, stupas, monasteries and palaces in the seven well defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage site but also in its well planned and well exhibited displays in museums and art galleries spread all over the Metropolitan area and also in its sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur. The museums display unique artifacts and paintings from 5th century AD onwards to date, including archeological exportations.\n\nThe Museums and Art galleries are: the National Museum; the Natural History Museum; Hanumandhoka Palace Complex; the Tribhuvan Museum; the Mahendra Museum; the Birendra Museum; National Library: the Birendra Museum; the Kaiser Library; the Asa Archives; the Patan Museum; the National Art Gallery; the Pujarimath Museum; the Bronze and Brass Museum; the NAFA Gallery; the Srijana Contemporary Art Gallery; the J Art Gallery; the NEF-ART (Nepal Fine Art) Gallery; the Moti Azima Gallery; and the Nepal Art Council Gallery. Some of the important museums and galleries are elaborated.\n\nThe National Museum is located in the western part of Kathmandu near the Swoyambhunath stupa\nin the historical building which was constructed in early 19th century by General Bhimsen Thapa. It is the most important museum in the country, housing an extensive collection of weapons, art and antiquities of historic and cultural importance. The museum was established in 1928 as a collection house of war trophies and weapons, and the initial name of this museum was \"Chhauni Silkhana\", which literally means \"the stone house of arms and ammunition\". Given its focus, the museum contains an extensive quantity of weapons, including locally made firearms used in various wars and leather cannons from the 18th–19th century and medieval and modern works in wood, bronze, stone, and paintings.\n\nThe Natural History Museum is located in the southern foothills of Swoyambhunath hill and has a sizeable collection of different species of animals, butterflies and plants. The museum is noted in particular for its serial display of diverse life species from prehistoric shells to the stuffed animals, birds, crocodiles and many others.\n\nThe Hanumandhoka Palace, a lavish medieval palace complex in the Durbar, contains three separate museums of historic importance:\nThe Tribhuvan Museum contains artifacts related to the King Tribhuvan (1906–1955). It has a variety of pieces including his personal belongings, letters and papers and memorabilia related to events he was involved in and a rare collection of photos and paintings of Royal family members. \nThe Mahendra Museum is also dedicated to a king, Mahendra (1920–1972 ). Like the Tribhuvan Museum, it includes his personal belongings such as decorations, stamps and coins and personal notes and manuscripts, but it also has structural reconstructions of his cabinet room and office chamber.\nThe Birendra museum contains items related to the late monarch, King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah (1972-2001), including the royal dress worn during various state and historic occasions, medals and honorary titles received from other head of states and many more.\n\nKathmandu is a center for art in Nepal, displaying the work of contemporary artists in the country and also collections of historical artists. Patan is particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts. Art in Kathmandu is vibrant, demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art, derived from a great number of national, Asian and global influences. Nepalese art though is commonly divided into two areas, the idealistic traditional painting known as Paubhas in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as Thangkas in Tibetan, which are usually highly colorful and bold and closely linked to the country's religious history and then the contemporary western style painting, including nature based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for. Internationally, the British-based charity, the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with protecting arts in Kathmandu.\n\nKathmandu contains many notable art galleries. The NAFA Gallery, operated by the Arts and crafts Department of the Royal Nepal Academy is housed in Sita Bhavan, a neo- classical old Rana palace, divided into two galleries, the permanent Birendra Art Gallery which displays works of successful contemporary painters and sculptors. and a temporary gallery featuring artwork of up and coming Nepalese artists of the country.\n\nThe Srijana Contemporary Art Gallery, located inside the Bhrikutimandap Exhibition grounds, hosts the work of contemporary painters and sculptors, and regularly organizes exhibitions, both solo and group shows. It also runs morning and evening classes in the various schools of art. Also of note is the Moti Azima Gallery, located in a three storied building in Bhimsenthan which contains an impressive collection of traditional utensils and handmade dolls and items typical of a medieval Newar house, giving an important insight into Nepalese history. The J Art Gallery is also located in Kathmandu, near the Royal Palace in Durbarmarg, Kathmandu and displays the artwork of eminent, established Nepalese painters and the Nepal Art Council Gallery, which is located in the Babar Mahal, on the way to Tribhuvan International Airport which contains artwork of both national and international artists and contains extensive halls regularly used for art exhibitions.\n\nThe National Library of Nepal, is located in Patan, the largest in country with in excess of more than 70,000 books, mostly in English, but also with many in Nepali, Sanskrit, Hindi and Nepal Bhasa. The library is in possession of rare scholarly books in Sanskrit and English dating from the 17th century AD. Kathmandu contains the Kaiser Library, located in the Kaiser Mahal on the ground floor of Ministry of Education building. The collection which totals around 45,000 books, is derived from a personal collection of the Field Marshal Kaiser Shumsher Rana. It covers a wide range of subjects including history, law, art, religion, philosophy etc. and a Sanskrit manual of 'Tantra', believed to be over 1000 years old.\n\nThe Asa Archives are also of major note and specialise in medieval history and religious traditions of the Kathmandu Valley. The archives are located in Kulumbbhula, and have a valuable collection of some 6,000 loose-leaf handwritten books and 1000 palm- leaf manuscripts, mostly in Sanskrit or Nepal Bhasa and a manuscript dated to 1464.\n\nKathmandu is home to the Nepalese theatre. The city contains several theatres of note including the National Dance Theatre in Kanti Path, the Ganga Theatre, The Himalayan Theatre and the Aarohan Theatre Group, founded in 1982 and the M. Art Theatre is based in the city. The Gurukul: School of Theatre organizes the Kathmandu International Theatre Festival, attracting artists from all over the world. A mini theatre is also located at the Hanumandhoka Durbar Square, established by the Durbar Conservation and Promotion Committee.\n\nKathmandu is also the centre of the Nepalese film industry and for production. Kathmandu has a number of cinemas showing Nepali, Indian and western films including the Biswajyoti Cinema Hall, Ranjana Cinema Hall, Kumari Cinema Hall, Jai Nepal Cinema Hall, Tara Cinema Hall, Gopi Krishna Cinema Hall and the Kalanki Cinema Hall.\n\nKathmandu is the centre of music and dance in Nepal and is integral to understanding the city. Various musical performances are organized in the cultural venues (Visit: Atul Gautam Memorial Gurukul, Kirateshwor, Kapan Music Center) of the city throughout the year. The city contains prestigious musical training schools such as the Atul Gautam Memorial Gurukul, Kirateshwor, Kapan Music Center, Asian Himalayan Music School. Many musical bands like Sursudha, Sukarma, Sampada Band (The heritage band), Trikaal etc. are famous in Nepal. There are various music venues and musical performances may include the Bhanchha Ghar in Kamaladi, Bhojan Griha in Dillibazar and the Nepali Chulo in Durbar Marg. Given the importance of Kathmandu to Tibetan Buddhists, the city also attracts monks from Tibet and across the Himalayan region who in coordination with their rituals in visiting sites such as the Boudhanath, will perform music there.\n\nKathmandu is noted internationally for its jazz festival, popularly known as Jazzmandu. It is the only jazz festival in the entire Himalayan region and was established in March 2002. The festival attracts musicians from countries worldwide such as Australia, Denmark, United States, Benin, and India.\n\nThe city has been referenced in numerous songs, including works by Cat Stevens \"Katmandu\", \"Mona Bone Jakon\" (1970), Bruce Cockburn (\"Tibetan Side of Town\", \"Big Circumstance\", 1988), Bob Seger (\"Katmandu\", \"Beautiful Loser\" (1975)), Rush (\"A Passage to Bangkok\" (\"Pulling into Kathmandu\"), \"2112, 1976), Krematorij (\"Kathmandu\", \"Three Springs\" (2000)), Fito Páez (\"Tráfico por Katmandú\" – \"Traffic through Kathmandu\"); Will Ackerman (\"A Happy Home in Kathmandu\", \"The Opening of Doors\" (1993)); Tantra (\"The Hills of Katmandu\", early 1980s); Ok Go \"Back From Kathmandu\" (Of the Blue Colour of the Sky (2010)); and Godiego (\"Coming Together in Kathmandu\", 1980).\nOn June 9, 2008, US Cultural Envoy Gene Aitken inaugurated the Kathmandu Jazz Conservatory (KJC) in nearby Lalitpur. A 10-day workshop for over 50 music teachers and Nepali jazz educators was initially held. The mandate of the Conservatory is to create a musical environment where musicians can become knowledgeable in various musical subjects, be exposed to different music genres, and most importantly, where all musicians, from beginners to advanced, can receive a proper music education. Investment in the school has been substantial. Facilities include a music hall which can seat 200 people, a music library, a listening lab, five practice rooms, two large rooms for ensemble rehearsal and group classes, separate rooms for both drum kit and percussion instruments, a piano practice room and a recording studio.\n\nThe cultural diversity of Nepal has facilitated the growth of a number of cuisines based on the ethnic groups and the geographical features of the nation. Popularly served though is Dal bhat, which is a dish of lentils and rice, generally served with vegetable curries and forms a staple part of the diet. Given that Kathmandu only had one restaurant in 1955, a large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since grown up catering in Nepalese cuisine, Tibetan cuisine and Indian cuisine in particular and many others to accommodate both for Nepalese people and for tourists from all around the world. The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American chop suey, which is a sweet and sour sauce with crispy noodles, with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptions of traditional cuisine.\nKathmandu is particularly famous for \"Mo: mo:\". Mo: mo: or म:म: is a type of dumpling that origined from Tibet. Many street vendors sell mo: mo:. It is one of the most popular fast foods in Kathmandu.\nThe national drink of Nepal is tea, widely served in Kathmandu, but is served extremely weak by western standards. \"Chiya\", however, is richer and contains tea leaves boiled with milk, sugar and spices and the drink \"lassis\", made of curds and sugar is also served in cafes and restaurants. Nepalese beer is available in such venues and in markets, including the national Gorkha beer brand. The popular Himalayan drinks of \"Chhaang\" and \"Tongba\", typically made from fermented millet or barley and also sold, as are the harder spirit drinks of \"arak\", made from fermented potatoes and rice. and \"rakshi\", a modern type of Newari wine. Shops and bars in Kathmandu do, however, widely sell western and Indian beers, although shops are forbidden to sell alcohol on the first two days and last two days of the Newari month.\n\nFresh vegetables and fruit are widely sold in Kathmandu, particularly around the Durbar. The assortment of produce is diverse, and some sellers may specialise in the sale of different forms of specific vegetables, such as beans, for instance. Western convenience foods are sold in abundance in most of the shops, including Carlsberg beer, Coca-Cola and various potato snacks and candy.\n\nMost of the fairs and festivals that are observed in Kathmandu have their origin to the Malla period. This was further given an urban cultural touch, not limiting it to the Newari festivities, subsequent to the Gorkha conquest in 1768–69. The culture of Parbatiyas and new migrant communities were also harmoniously amalgamated. The festivities such as the Ghode (horse) jatra, Indra-Jatra, Dasai Durga Puja festivals, Shivratri and many more are observed by all Hindu and Buddhist communities of Kathmandu with great devotional fervour and enthusiasm. Social regulation in the codes enacted incorporated the Hindu religious traditions and ethics. These were followed by the Shah Kings as had been followed by previous kings, as devout Hindus and protectors of Buddhist religion. Christian proselytizing was not allowed by the Shahs though Christian missionaries did try to spread the message of Christ in the Himalayan kingdom.\n\nCultural continuity has been maintained for centuries – from ancient to modern period – in the exclusive worship of goddesses and deities such as the Ajima, Taleju (or Tulja Bhavani), Degutaleju, Kumari (the living goddess) and so forth in Kathmandu and the rest of the country.\n\nThe artistic edifices have now become places of worship in the everyday life of the people, and thus a roster is maintained to observe the annual festivals, which is intimately linked with the daily life of the people. It is said that there are 133 festivals held in year.\n\nSome of the traditional festivals observed in Kathmandu now are: Bada Dashain, Mohani, Tihar, Swanti, Chhath, Maghe Sankranti, Naga Panchami, Janai Poornima, Pancha Dan, Teej/Rishi Panchami, Indra Jatra Yenya, Ghanta Karna, Buddha Jayanti, Sri Panchami, Maha Shivaratri, Phagu Poornima, Pahan Charhe, Ghodejatra, Chaite Dashain, Nava Varsha, Jana Baha Dyah Jatra and Matatirtha Aunsi, apart from those mentioned earlier.\n"}

Items like bricks could be considered perfectly durable goods because they should theoretically never wear out. Highly durable goods such as refrigerators or cars usually continue to be useful for three or more years of use, so durable goods are typically characterized by long periods between successive purchases.\n\nExamples of consumer durable goods include automobiles, books, household goods (home appliances, consumer electronics, furniture, tools, etc.), sports equipment, jewelry, medical equipment, firearms, and toys.\n\nNondurable goods or soft goods (consumables) are the opposite of durable goods. They may be defined either as goods that are immediately consumed in one use or ones that have a lifespan of less than three years.\n\nExamples of nondurable goods include fast-moving consumer goods such as cosmetics and cleaning products, food, condiments, fuel, beer, cigarettes and tobacco, medication, office supplies, packaging and containers, paper and paper products, personal products, rubber, plastics, textiles, clothing, and footwear.\n\nWhile durable goods can usually be rented as well as bought, nondurable goods generally are not rented. While buying durable goods comes under the category of investment demand of goods, buying non-durables comes under the category of consumption demand of goods.\n\nAccording to Cooper (1994, p5) \"durability is the ability of a product to perform its required function over a lengthy period under normal conditions of use without excessive expenditure on maintenance or repair\". Several units may be used to measure the durability of a product according to its field of application such as years of existence, hours of use and operational cycles.\n\nThe life span of household goods is significant for sustainable consumption. The longer product life spans could contribute to eco-efficiency and sufficiency, thus, slowing consumption in order to progress towards a sustainable consumption. Cooper (2005) proposed a model to demonstrate the crucial role of product life spans to sustainable production and consumption.\n\nDurability as a characteristic relating to the quality of goods, that can be demanded by consumers, was not clear until an amendment of the law relating to the quality standards for supplied goods in 1994[5].\n\n"}
{"id": "1210359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1210359", "title": "Frankish language", "text": "Frankish language\n\nFrankish (reconstructed Frankish: *), Old Franconian or Old Frankish was the West Germanic language spoken by the Franks between the 4th and 8th century. The language itself is poorly attested, but it gave rise to numerous loanwords in Old French. Old Dutch is the term for the Old Franconian dialects that were spoken in the Low Countries, including present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and Western parts of today's Germany, until about the 12th century when it evolved into Middle Dutch.\n\nDuring the Merovingian period, Frankish had significant influence on the Romance languages which displaced it after these evolved from the Latin language which was introduced into Gaul by the Romans. As a result, many modern French words and placenames, including the country name \"France\", have a Frankish (i.e. Germanic) origin. France itself is still known by terms meaning the \"Frankish Realm\" in languages such as German (), Dutch (), and Danish (). Between the 5th and 9th centuries, the languages spoken by the Salian Franks in Belgium and the Netherlands evolved into Old Dutch (Old Low Franconian), while in Picardy and it was eventually outnumbered and replaced by Old French (the last stage of Latin in its evolution into French) as the dominant language.\n\nThe Frankish language as spoken before the Carolingian period is mostly reconstructed from Old French loanwords and from the Old Dutch language as recorded in the 6th to 12th centuries. A notable exception is the Bergakker inscription, which may represent a primary record of 5th-century Frankish.\n\nGermanic philology and German studies have their origins in the first half of the 19th century when Romanticism and Romantic thought heavily influenced the lexicon of the linguists and philologists of the time, including pivotal figures such as the Brothers Grimm. As a result, many contemporary linguists tried to incorporate their findings in an already existing historical framework of \"stem duchies\" and (lit. \"old tribes\", i.e. the six Germanic tribes then thought to have formed the \"German nation\" in the traditional German nationalism of the elites) resulting in a taxonomy which spoke of \"Bavarian\", \"Saxon\", \"Frisian\", \"Thuringian\", \"Swabian\" and \"Frankish\" dialects. While this nomenclature became generally accepted in traditional Germanic philology, it has also been described as \"inherently inaccurate\" as these ancient ethnic boundaries (as understood in the 19th century) bore little or limited resemblance to the actual or historical linguistic situation of the Germanic languages. Among other problems, this traditional classification of the continental West Germanic dialects can suggest stronger ties between dialects than is linguistically warranted. The Franconian group is a well known example of this, with East Franconian being much more closely related to Bavarian dialects than it is to Dutch, which is traditionally placed in the Low Franconian sub-grouping and with which it was thought to have had a common, tribal origin.\n\nIn a modern linguistic context, the language of the early Franks is variously called \"Old Frankish\" or \"Old Franconian\" and refers to the language of the Franks prior to the advent of the High German consonant shift, which took place between 600 and 700 CE. After this consonant shift the Frankish dialect diverges, with the dialects which would become modern Dutch not undergoing the consonantal shift, while all others did so to varying degrees. As a result, the distinction between Old Dutch and Old Frankish is largely negligible, with Old Dutch (also called Old Low Franconian) being the term used to differentiate between the affected and non-affected variants following the aforementioned Second Germanic consonant shift.\n\nThe Germanic languages are traditionally divided into three groups: West, East and North Germanic. Their exact relation is difficult to determine, and they remained mutually intelligible throughout the Migration Period, rendering some individual varieties difficult to classify.\n\nThe language spoken by the Franks was part of the West Germanic language group, which had features from Proto-Germanic in the late Jastorf culture (ca. 1st century BC). The West Germanic group is characterized by a number of phonological and morphological innovations not found in North and East Germanic. The West Germanic varieties of the time are generally split into three dialect groups: Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic), Istvaeonic (Weser-Rhine Germanic) and Irminonic (Elbe Germanic). While each had its own distinct characteristics, there certainly must have still been a high degree of mutual intelligibility between these dialects. In fact, it is unclear whether the West Germanic continuum of this time period, or indeed Franconian itself, should still be considered a single language or that it should be considered a collection of similar dialects.\n\nIn any case, it appears that the Frankish tribes, or the later Franks, fit primarily into the Istvaeonic dialect group, with certain Ingvaeonic influences towards the northwest (still seen in modern Dutch), and more Irminonic (High German) influences towards the southeast.\n\nThe scholarly consensus concerning the Migration Period is that the Frankish identity emerged during the first half of the 3rd century out of various earlier, smaller Germanic groups, including the Salii, Sicambri, Chamavi, Bructeri, Chatti, Chattuarii, Ampsivarii, Tencteri, Ubii, Batavi and the Tungri. It is speculated that these tribes originally spoke a range of related Istvaeonic dialects in the West Germanic branch of Proto-Germanic. Sometime in the 4th or 5th centuries, it becomes appropriate to speak of Old Franconian rather than an Istvaeonic dialect of Proto-Germanic.\n\nVery little is known about what the language was like during this period. One older runic sentence (dating from around 425–450 AD) is on the sword sheath of Bergakker which is either the singular direct attestation of the Old Franconian language or the earliest attestation of Old Low Franconian (Old Dutch) language. Another early sentence from the early 6th century AD (that is described as the earliest sentence in Old Dutch as well) is found in the Lex Salica. This phrase was used to free a serf:\n\nThese are the earliest sentences yet found of Old Franconian.\nDuring this early period, the Franks were divided politically and geographically into two groups: the Salian Franks and the Ripuarian Franks. The language (or set of dialects) spoken by the Salian Franks during this period is sometimes referred to as early \"Old Low Franconian\", and consisted of two groups: \"Old West Low Franconian\" and \"Old East Low Franconian\". The language (or set of dialects) spoken by the Ripuarian Franks are referred to just as Old Franconian dialects (or, by some, as Old Frankish dialects).\n\nHowever, as already stated above, it may be more accurate to think of these dialects not as early Old Franconian but as Istvaeonic dialects in the West Germanic branch of Proto-Germanic.\n\nAt around 500 AD the Franks probably spoke a range of related dialects and languages rather than a single uniform dialect or language. The language of both government and the Church was Latin.\n\nDuring the expansion into France and Germany, many Frankish people remained in the original core Frankish territories in the north (i.e. southern Netherlands, Flanders, a small part of northern France and the adjoining area in Germany centred on Cologne). The Franks united as a single group under Salian Frank leadership around 500 AD. Politically, the Ripuarian Franks existed as a separate group only until about 500 AD, after which they were subsumed into the Salian Franks. The Franks were united, but the various Frankish groups must have continued to live in the same areas, and speak the same dialects, although as a part of the growing Frankish Kingdom.\n\nThere must have been a close relationship between the various Franconian dialects. There was also a close relationship between Old Low Franconian (i.e. Old Dutch) and its neighbouring Old Saxon and Old Frisian languages and dialects to the north and northeast, as well as the related Old English (Anglo-Saxon) dialects spoken in southern and eastern Britain.\n\nA widening cultural divide grew between the Franks remaining in the north and the rulers far to the south. Franks continued to reside in their original territories and to speak their original dialects and languages. It is not known what they called their language, but it is possible that they always called it \"Diets\" (i.e. \"the people's language\"), or something similar.\n\nPhilologists think of Old Dutch and Old West Low Franconian as being the same language. However, sometimes reference is made to a transition from the language spoken by the Salian Franks to Old Dutch. The language spoken by the Salian Franks must have developed significantly during the seven centuries from 200 to 900 AD. At some point the language spoken by the Franks must have become identifiably Dutch. Because Franconian texts are almost non-existent and Old Dutch texts scarce and fragmentary, it is difficult to determine when such a transition occurred, but it is thought to have happened by the end of the 9th century and perhaps earlier. By 900 AD the language spoken was recognisably an early form of Dutch, but that might also have been the case earlier. Old Dutch made the transition to Middle Dutch around 1150. A Dutch-French language boundary came into existence (but this was originally south of where it is today). Even though living in the original territory of the Franks, these Franks seem to have broken with the endonym \"Frank\" around the 9th century. By this time the Frankish identity had changed from an ethnic identity to a national identity, becoming localized and confined to the modern \"Franconia\" in Germany and principally to the French province of \"Île-de-France\".\n\nThe Franks expanded south into Gaul. Although the Franks would eventually conquer all of Gaul, speakers of Old Franconian apparently expanded in sufficient numbers only into northern Gaul to have a linguistic effect. For several centuries, northern Gaul was a bilingual territory (Vulgar Latin and Franconian). The language used in writing, in government and by the Church was Latin. Eventually, the Franks who had settled more to the south of this area in northern Gaul started adopting the Vulgar Latin of the local population. This Vulgar Latin language acquired the name of the people who came to speak it (Frankish or \"Français\"); north of the French-Dutch language boundary, the language was no longer referred to as \"Frankish\" (if it ever was referred to as such) but rather came to be referred to as \"Diets\", i.e. the \"people's language\". Urban T. Holmes has proposed that a Germanic language continued to be spoken as a second tongue by public officials in western Austrasia and Neustria as late as the 850s, and that it completely disappeared as a spoken language from these regions only during the 10th century.\n\nThe Franks also expanded their rule southeast into parts of Germany. Their language had some influence on local dialects, especially for terms relating to warfare. \nHowever, since the language of both the administration and the Church was Latin, this unification did not lead to the development of a supra-regional variety of Franconian nor a standardized German language. At the same time that the Franks were expanding southeast into what is now southern Germany, there were linguistic changes taking place in the region. The High German consonant shift (or second Germanic consonant shift) was a phonological development (sound change) that took place in the southern parts of the West Germanic dialect continuum in several phases, probably beginning between the 3rd and 5th centuries AD, and was almost complete before the earliest written records in the High German language were made in the 9th century. The resulting language, Old High German, can be neatly contrasted with Low Franconian, which for the most part did not experience the shift.\n\nThe set of dialects of the Franks who continued to live in their original territory in the Low Countries eventually developed in three different ways.\n\nThe Frankish Empire later extended throughout neighbouring France and Germany. The language of the Franks had some influence on the local languages (especially in France), but never took hold as a standard language because Latin was the international language at the time. However, the language of the Franks did not develop into the lingua franca.\n\nThe Franks conquered adjoining territories of Germany (including the territory of the Allemanni). The Frankish legacy survives in these areas, for example, in the names of the city of Frankfurt and the area of Franconia. \nThe Franks brought their language with them from their original territory and, as in France, it must have had an effect on the local dialects and languages. However, it is relatively difficult for linguists today to determine what features of these dialects are due to Frankish influence, because the latter was in large parts obscured, or even overwhelmed, by later developments.\n\nMost French words of Germanic origin came from Frankish (some others are English loanwords), often replacing the Latin word which would have been used. It is estimated that modern French took approximately 1000 stem words from Old Franconian. Many of these words were concerned with agriculture (e.g. \"garden\"), war (e.g. \"war\") or social organization (e.g. \"baron\"). Old Franconian has introduced the modern French word for the nation, France (Francia), meaning \"land of the Franks\", as well as possibly the name for the Paris region, Île-de-France.\n\nThe influence of Franconian on French is decisive for the birth of the early Langue d'oïl compared to the other Romance languages, that appeared later such as Langue d'oc, Romanian, Portuguese and Catalan, Italian, etc., because its influence was greater than the respective influence of Visigothic and Lombardic (both Germanic languages) on the \"langue d'oc\", the Romance languages of Iberia, and Italian. Not all of these loanwords have been retained in modern French. French has also passed on words of Franconian origin to other Romance languages, and to English.\n\nOld Franconian has also left many etyma in the different Northern Langues d'oïls such as Picard, Champenois, Bas-Lorrain and Walloon, more than in Common French, and not always the same ones.\n\nSee below a non-exhaustive list of French words of Frankish origin. An asterisk prefixing a term indicates a reconstructed form of the Frankish word. Most Franconian words with the phoneme \"w\" changed it to \"gu\" when entering Old French and other Romance languages; however, the northern langue d'oïl dialects such as Picard, Northern Norman, Walloon, Burgundian, Champenois and Bas-Lorrain retained the [w] or turned it into [v]. Perhaps the best known example is the Franconian *\"werra\" (\"war\" < Old Northern French \"werre\", compare Old High German \"werre\" \"quarrel\"), which entered modern French as \"guerre\" and \"guerra\" in Italian, Occitan, Catalan, Spanish and Portuguese. Other examples include \"gant\" (\"gauntlet\", from *\"want\") and \"garder\" (\"to guard\", from *\"wardōn\"). Franconian words starting with \"s\" before another consonant developed it into \"es\"- (e.g. Franconian \"skirm\" and Old French \"escremie\" > Old Italian \"scrimia\" > Modern French \"escrime\").\n\nFranconian speech habits are also responsible for the replacement of Latin \"cum\" (\"with\") with \"od\" ← \"apud\" \"at\", then with \"avuec\" ← \"apud hoc\" \"at it\" ≠ Italian, Spanish \"con\") in Old French (Modern French \"avec\"), and for the preservation of Latin nominative \"homo\" \"man\" as an impersonal pronoun: cf. \"homme\" ← \"hominem\" \"man (accusative)\" and Old French \"hum, hom, om\" → modern \"on\", \"one\" (compare Dutch \"man\" \"man\" and \"men\", \"one\").\n\nMiddle English also adopted many words with Franconian roots from Old French; e.g. \"random\" (via Old French \"randon\", Old French verb \"randir\", from \"*rant\" \"a running\"), \"standard\" (via Old French \"estandart\", from \"*standhard\" \"stand firm\"), \"scabbard\" (via Anglo-French *\"escauberc\", from *\"skar-berg\"), \"grape\", \"stale\", \"march\" (via Old French \"marche\", from *\"marka\") among others.\n\n\n"}

The film is based on the Russian play \"Тот, кто получает пощёчины\" (\"He Who Gets Slapped\", transliterated as \"Tot, kto polučájet poščóčiny\") by playwright Leonid Andreyev, which was published in 1914 and in English, as \"He Who Gets Slapped\", in 1922. The Russian original was made into a Russian movie in 1916.\n\n\"He Who Gets Slapped\" was the first film produced entirely by the newly formed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It was not, however, MGM's first released movie, as the film was held until the Christmas season when higher attendance was expected. The movie was highly profitable for the fledgling MGM, and was critically hailed upon release. It was also the first film to feature Leo the Lion as the mascot for MGM. Previously, Leo appeared in the logo for Goldwyn Pictures Corporation in 1916, and the trademark was retained by MGM when the companies merged.\n\nThe film was important in the careers of Chaney, Shearer, Gilbert, and Sjöström. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nPaul Beaumont (Lon Chaney) is a scientist who labored for years alone to prove his radical theories on the origin of mankind. Baron Regnard (Marc McDermott) becomes his patron, enabling him to do research while living in his mansion.

He leaves the arrangements to the Baron. However, after Beaumont goes to sleep, Marie steals his key, opens the safe containing his papers, and gives them to the baron.\n\nOn the appointed day, Paul travels to the Academy with the Baron. He is aghast when the Baron, instead of introducing him, takes credit for Paul's work himself. After he recovers from the shock, Paul confronts him in front of everyone, but the Baron tells them that Paul is merely his assistant and slaps him. All of the academicians laugh at his humiliation. Paul later seeks comfort from his wife, but she brazenly admits she and the baron are having an affair and calls him a clown. Paul leaves them.\n\nFive years pass by. Paul is now a clown calling himself \"HE who gets slapped\", the star attraction of a small circus near Paris. His act consists of his getting slapped every evening by other clowns, and includes Paul pretending to present in front of the Academy of Science.\n\nAnother of the performers is Bezano (John Gilbert), a daredevil horseback rider. Consuelo (Norma Shearer), the daughter of the impoverished Count Mancini, applies to join his act. Bezano falls in love with Consuelo, as does Paul. Consuelo and her father, however, are planning to restore the family's fortunes with a marriage to her father's wealthy friend.\n\nOne night, during HE's performance, he spots the baron in the audience. The baron goes backstage and begins flirting with Consuelo, which she does not like. The next day, the baron sends Consuelo jewelry, but she rejects it.\n\nWhen her father leaves for a meeting with the baron, Bezano takes Consuelo out to the countryside for a romantic meeting, where they declare their love for each other. Meanwhile, Count Mancini convinces the reluctant baron that the only way he can have Consuelo is by marrying her. The baron discards the heartbroken Marie, leaving her with a check.\n\nLater, HE admits to Consuelo he, too, is in love with her. She thinks he is kidding and laughingly slaps him. They are interrupted by the baron and the count, who inform Consuelo she will marry the baron after the night's performance. When HE tries to interfere, he is locked in an adjoining room, where an angry lion is kept in a cage. He moves the cage so that, when he carefully opens it, only the door to the next room prevents the lion from escaping. HE re-enters the other room through the only other entrance (making sure to lock it behind him) and reveals his identity to the baron. HE threatens the baron, but the count stabs him with a sword.\n\nThe baron and the count try to leave but, finding the main entrance locked, open the side door, releasing the lion. The animal kills the count, then the baron. However, the lion tamer shows up and saves HE from the same fate. HE goes on stage and collapses. He assures Consuelo he is happy and that she will be happy, before dying in her arms.\n\n\nThe film was given a newly composed score by Will Gregory from the band Goldfrapp for use at live concert screenings of the film, initially in the Colston Hall in Bristol, UK on 1 December 2007. \nThe score was later broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in February 2008 with linking narration by actor Samuel West to relay to listeners the plot of the film.\nThe Alloy Orchestra has also composed a score for the film.\n\nThe film made a profit of $349,000.\n\n\"He Who Gets Slapped\" was released on DVD by Warner Brothers Digital Distribution on November 30, 1999. Warner has re-released the film several times as a part of its 6-disk Warner Archive Collection, first on November 22, 2011 and later on June 23, 2015.\n\n\"He Who Gets Slapped\" received mostly positive reviews from critics upon its release, with many praising the film and Chaney's performance.\nIn his 1924 review of the film for \"New York Times\", Mordaunt Hall praised the film's direction, performances, and story, calling it' \"the finest production we have yet seen\".\nAuthor and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film three out of a possible four stars, calling it \"a Pagliacci–type vehicle for Chaney.\"\nChristopher Meeks from \"Variety\" gave the film a positive review, commending the film's inventive staging, lighting and sound design, and performances, but felt that the ending was predictable and drawn out.\nHans J. Wollstein from Allmovie gave the film a positive review, praising Chaney's and McDermott's performances.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14724", "title": "Intellectual property", "text": "Intellectual property\n\nIntellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect, and primarily encompasses copyrights, patents, and trademarks. It also includes other types of rights, such as trade secrets, publicity rights, moral rights, and rights against unfair competition. Artistic works like music and literature, as well as some discoveries, inventions, words, phrases, symbols, and designs, can all be protected as intellectual property. It was not until the 19th century that the term \"intellectual property\" began to be used, and not until the late 20th century that it became commonplace in the majority of the world.\n\nThe main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a large variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they createusually for a limited period of time. This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to profit from the information and intellectual goods they create. These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.\n\nThe intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is \"indivisible\" – an unlimited number of people can \"consume\" an intellectual good without it being depleted. Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation – a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.\n\nThe Statute of Monopolies (1624) and the British Statute of Anne (1710) are seen as the origins of patent law and copyright respectively, firmly establishing the concept of intellectual property.\n\nThe first known use of the term \"intellectual property\" dates to 1769, when a piece published in the \"Monthly Review\" used the phrase. The first clear example of modern usage goes back as early as 1808, when it was used as a heading title in a collection of essays.\n\nThe German equivalent was used with the founding of the North German Confederation whose constitution granted legislative power over the protection of intellectual property (\"Schutz des geistigen Eigentums\") to the confederation. When the administrative secretariats established by the Paris Convention (1883) and the Berne Convention (1886) merged in 1893, they located in Berne, and also adopted the term intellectual property in their new combined title, the United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property.\n\nThe organization subsequently relocated to Geneva in 1960, and was succeeded in 1967 with the establishment of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) by treaty as an agency of the United Nations. According to legal scholar Mark Lemley, it was only at this point that the term really began to be used in the United States (which had not been a party to the Berne Convention), and it did not enter popular usage there until passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980.\n\n\"The history of patents does not begin with inventions, but rather with royal grants by Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603) for monopoly privileges... Approximately 200 years after the end of Elizabeth's reign, however, a patent represents a legal right obtained by an inventor providing for exclusive control over the production and sale of his mechanical or scientific invention... [demonstrating] the evolution of patents from royal prerogative to common-law doctrine.\"\n\nThe term can be found used in an October 1845 Massachusetts Circuit Court ruling in the patent case \"Davoll et al. v. Brown.\", in which Justice Charles L. Woodbury wrote that \"only in this way can we protect intellectual property, the labors of the mind, productions and interests are as much a man's own...as the wheat he cultivates, or the flocks he rears.\" The statement that \"discoveries are..property\" goes back earlier. Section 1 of the French law of 1791 stated, \"All new discoveries are the property of the author; to assure the inventor the property and temporary enjoyment of his discovery, there shall be delivered to him a patent for five, ten or fifteen years.\" In Europe, French author A. Nion mentioned \"propriété intellectuelle\" in his \"Droits civils des auteurs, artistes et inventeurs\", published in 1846.\n\nUntil recently, the purpose of intellectual property law was to give as little protection as possible in order to encourage innovation. Historically, therefore, they were granted only when they were necessary to encourage invention, limited in time and scope. This is mainly as a result of knowledge being traditionally viewed as a public good, in order to allow its extensive dissemination and improvement thereof.\n\nThe concept's origins can potentially be traced back further. Jewish law includes several considerations whose effects are similar to those of modern intellectual property laws, though the notion of intellectual creations as property does not seem to exist – notably the principle of Hasagat Ge'vul (unfair encroachment) was used to justify limited-term publisher (but not author) copyright in the 16th century. In 500 BCE, the government of the Greek state of Sybaris offered one year's patent \"to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury\".\n\nAccording to Jean-Frédéric Morin, \"the global intellectual property regime is currently in the midst of a paradigm shift\". Indeed, up until the early 2000s the global IP regime used to be dominated by high standards of protection characteristic of IP laws from Europe or the United States, with a vision that uniform application of these standards over every country and to several fields with little consideration over social, cultural or environmental values or of the national level of economic development. Morin argues that \"the emerging discourse of the global IP regime advocates for greater policy flexibility and greater access to knowledge, especially for developing countries.\" Indeed, with the Development Agenda adopted by WIPO in 2007, a set of 45 recommendations to adjust WIPO’s activities to the specific needs of developing countries and aim to reduce distortions especially on issues such as patients’ access to medicines, Internet users’ access to information, farmers’ access to seeds, programmers’ access to source codes or students’ access to scientific articles. However, this paradigm shift has not yet manifested itself in concrete legal reforms at the international level.\n\nSimilarly, it is based on these background that the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement requires members of the WTO to set minimum standards of legal protection, but its objective to have a “one-fits-all” protection law on Intellectual Property has been viewed with controversies regarding differences in the development level of countries. Despite the controversy, the agreement has extensively incorporated intellectual property rights into the global trading system for the first time in 1995, and has prevailed as the most comprehensive agreement reached by the world.\n\nIntellectual property rights include patents, copyright, industrial design rights, trademarks, plant variety rights, trade dress, geographical indications, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets. There are also more specialized or derived varieties of \"sui generis\" exclusive rights, such as circuit design rights (called mask work rights in the US) and supplementary protection certificates for pharmaceutical products (after expiry of a patent protecting them) and database rights (in European law). The term \"industrial property\" is sometimes used to refer to a large subset of intellectual property rights including patents, trademarks, industrial designs, utility models, service marks, trade names, and geographical indications.\n\nA patent is a form of right granted by the government to an inventor or their successor-in-title, giving the owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell, and importing an invention for a limited period of time, in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem, which may be a product or a process and generally has to fulfill three main requirements: it has to be new, not obvious and there needs to be an industrial applicability. To enrich the body of knowledge and stimulate innovation, it is an obligation for patent owners to disclose valuable information about their inventions to the public.\n\nA copyright gives the creator of an original work exclusive rights to it, usually for a limited time. Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or \"works\". Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves, only the form or manner in which they are expressed.\n\nAn industrial design right (sometimes called \"design right\" or \"design patent\") protects the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian. An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value. An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft. Generally speaking, it is what makes a product look appealing, and as such, it increases the commercial value of goods.\n\nPlant breeders' rights or plant variety rights are the rights to commercially use a new variety of a plant. The variety must amongst others be novel and distinct and for registration the evaluation of propagating material of the variety is considered.\n\nA trademark is a recognizable sign, design or expression which distinguishes products or services of a particular trader from the similar products or services of other traders.\n\nTrade dress is a legal term of art that generally refers to characteristics of the visual and aesthetic appearance of a product or its packaging (or even the design of a building) that signify the source of the product to consumers.\n\nA trade secret is a formula, practice, process, design, instrument, pattern, or compilation of information which is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable, by which a business can obtain an economic advantage over competitors and customers. There is no formal government protection granted; each business must take measures to guard its own trade secrets (e.g., Formula of its soft drinks is a trade secret for Coca-Cola.)\n\nThe main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods for consumers. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time. Because they can then profit from them, this gives economic incentive for their creation. The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is indivisible – an unlimited number of people can \"consume\" an intellectual good without it being depleted. Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation – while a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of information and intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent their wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.\n\nBy exchanging limited exclusive rights for disclosure of inventions and creative works, society and the patentee/copyright owner mutually benefit, and an incentive is created for inventors and authors to create and disclose their work. Some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be \"absolute protection\". \"If some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation, they reason, more is better. The thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions\". This absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of \"real\" property, typically adopting its law and rhetoric. Other recent developments in intellectual property law, such as the America Invents Act, stress international harmonization. Recently there has also been much debate over the desirability of using intellectual property rights to protect cultural heritage, including intangible ones, as well as over risks of commodification derived from this possibility. The issue still remains open in legal scholarship.\n\nThese exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated research and development costs. In the United States Article I Section 8 Clause 8 of the Constitution, commonly called the Patent and Copyright Clause, reads; \"[The Congress shall have power] 'To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'\" ”Some commentators, such as David Levine and Michele Boldrin, dispute this justification.\n\nIn 2013 the United States Patent & Trademark Office approximated that the worth of intellectual property to the U.S. economy is more than US $5 trillion and creates employment for an estimated 18 million American people. The value of intellectual property is considered similarly high in other developed nations, such as those in the European Union. In the UK, IP has become a recognised asset class for use in pension-led funding and other types of business finance. However, in 2013, the UK Intellectual Property Office stated: \"There are millions of intangible business assets whose value is either not being leveraged at all, or only being leveraged inadvertently\".\n\nThe WIPO treaty and several related international agreements underline that the protection of intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining economic growth. The \"WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook\" gives two reasons for intellectual property laws:\nOne is to give statutory expression to the moral and economic rights of creators in their creations and the rights of the public in access to those creations. The second is to promote, as a deliberate act of Government policy, creativity and the dissemination and application of its results and to encourage fair trading which would contribute to economic and social development.\n\nThe Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) states that \"effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth across all industries and globally\".\n\nEconomists estimate that two-thirds of the value of large businesses in the United States can be traced to intangible assets. \"IP-intensive industries\" are estimated to generate 72 percent more value added (price minus material cost) per employee than \"non-IP-intensive industries\".\n\nA joint research project of the WIPO and the United Nations University measuring the impact of IP systems on six Asian countries found \"a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth.\"\n\nAccording to Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \"everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author\". Although the relationship between intellectual property and human rights is a complex one, there are moral arguments for intellectual property.\n\nThe arguments that justify intellectual property fall into three major categories. Personality theorists believe intellectual property is an extension of an individual. Utilitarians believe that intellectual property stimulates social progress and pushes people to further innovation. Lockeans argue that intellectual property is justified based on deservedness and hard work.\n\nVarious moral justifications for private property can be used to argue in favor of the morality of intellectual property, such as:\n\n\nLysander Spooner (1855) argues \"that a man has a natural and absolute right—and if a natural and absolute, then necessarily a perpetual, right—of property, in the ideas, of which he is the discoverer or creator; that his right of property, in ideas, is intrinsically the same as, and stands on identically the same grounds with, his right of property in material things; that no distinction, of principle, exists between the two cases\".\n\nWriter Ayn Rand argued in her book \"\" that the protection of intellectual property is essentially a moral issue. The belief is that the human mind itself is the source of wealth and survival and that all property at its base is intellectual property. To violate intellectual property is therefore no different morally than violating other property rights which compromises the very processes of survival and therefore constitutes an immoral act.\n\nViolation of intellectual property rights, called \"infringement\" with respect to patents, copyright, and trademarks, and \"misappropriation\" with respect to trade secrets, may be a breach of civil law or criminal law, depending on the type of intellectual property involved, jurisdiction, and the nature of the action.\n\nAs of 2011 trade in counterfeit copyrighted and trademarked works was a $600 billion industry worldwide and accounted for 5–7% of global trade.\n\nPatent infringement typically is caused by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in the claims of the granted patent. There is safe harbor in many jurisdictions to use a patented invention for research. This safe harbor does not exist in the US unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes, or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug. In general, patent infringement cases are handled under civil law (e.g., in the United States) but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also (for example, Argentina, China, France, Japan, Russia, South Korea).\n\nCopyright infringement is reproducing, distributing, displaying or performing a work, or to make derivative works, without permission from the copyright holder, which is typically a publisher or other business representing or assigned by the work's creator. It is often called \"piracy\". While copyright is created the instant a work is fixed, generally the copyright holder can only get money damages if the owner registers the copyright. Enforcement of copyright is generally the responsibility of the copyright holder. The ACTA trade agreement, signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the EU, and which has not entered into force, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to active police for infringement. There are limitations and exceptions to copyright, allowing limited use of copyrighted works, which does not constitute infringement. Examples of such doctrines are the fair use and fair dealing doctrine.\n\nTrademark infringement occurs when one party uses a trademark that is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark owned by another party, in relation to products or services which are identical or similar to the products or services of the other party. In many countries, a trademark receives protection without registration, but registering a trademark provides legal advantages for enforcement. Infringement can be addressed by civil litigation and, in several jurisdictions, under criminal law.\n\nTrade secret misappropriation is different from violations of other intellectual property laws, since by definition trade secrets are secret, while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available. In the United States, trade secrets are protected under state law, and states have nearly universally adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The United States also has federal law in the form of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, , criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. The second, , criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.) In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an equitable right rather than a property right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as in the United States.\n\nCriticism of the term \"intellectual property\" ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like \"property\" and \"rights\" in fashions that contradict practice and law. Many detractors think this term specially serves the doctrinal agenda of parties opposing reform in the public interest or otherwise abusing related legislations; and that it disallows intelligent discussion about specific and often unrelated aspects of copyright, patents, trademarks, etc.\n\nFree Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman argues that, although the term \"intellectual property\" is in wide use, it should be rejected altogether, because it \"systematically distorts and confuses these issues, and its use was and is promoted by those who gain from this confusion\". He claims that the term \"operates as a catch-all to lump together disparate laws [which] originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues\" and that it creates a \"bias\" by confusing these monopolies with ownership of limited physical things, likening them to \"property rights\". Stallman advocates referring to copyrights, patents and trademarks in the singular and warns against abstracting disparate laws into a collective term. He argues that \"to avoid spreading unnecessary bias and confusion, it is best to adopt a firm policy not to speak or even think in terms of 'intellectual property'.\"\n\nSimilarly, economists Boldrin and Levine prefer to use the term \"intellectual monopoly\" as a more appropriate and clear definition of the concept, which they argue, is very dissimilar from property rights. They further argued that “stronger patents do little or nothing to encourage innovation”, mainly explained by its tendency to create market monopolies, thereby restricting further innovations and technology transfer.\n\nOn the assumption that intellectual property rights are actual rights, Stallman says that this claim does not live to the historical intentions behind these laws, which in the case of copyright served as a censorship system, and later on, a regulatory model for the printing press that may have benefited authors incidentally, but never interfered with the freedom of average readers. Still referring to copyright, he cites legal literature such as the United States Constitution and case law to demonstrate that the law is meant to be an optional and experimental bargain to temporarily trade property rights and free speech for public, not private, benefits in the form of increased artistic production and knowledge. He mentions that \"if copyright were a natural right nothing could justify terminating this right after a certain period of time\".\n\nLaw professor, writer and political activist Lawrence Lessig, along with many other copyleft and free software activists, has criticized the implied analogy with physical property (like land or an automobile). They argue such an analogy fails because physical property is generally rivalrous while intellectual works are non-rivalrous (that is, if one makes a copy of a work, the enjoyment of the copy does not prevent enjoyment of the original). Other arguments along these lines claim that unlike the situation with tangible property, there is no natural scarcity of a particular idea or information: once it exists at all, it can be re-used and duplicated indefinitely without such re-use diminishing the original. Stephan Kinsella has objected to \"intellectual property\" on the grounds that the word \"property\" implies scarcity, which may not be applicable to ideas.\n\nEntrepreneur and politician Rickard Falkvinge and hacker Alexandre Oliva have independently compared George Orwell's fictional dialect Newspeak to the terminology used by intellectual property supporters as a linguistic weapon to shape public opinion regarding copyright debate and DRM.\n\nIn civil law jurisdictions, intellectual property has often been referred to as intellectual rights, traditionally a somewhat broader concept that has included moral rights and other personal protections that cannot be bought or sold. Use of the term \"intellectual rights\" has declined since the early 1980s, as use of the term \"intellectual property\" has increased.\n\nAlternative terms \"monopolies on information\" and \"intellectual monopoly\" have emerged among those who argue against the \"property\" or \"intellect\" or \"rights\" assumptions, notably Richard Stallman. The backronyms \"intellectual protectionism\" and \"intellectual poverty\", whose initials are also \"IP\", have found supporters as well, especially among those who have used the backronym \"digital restrictions management\".\n\nThe argument that an intellectual property right should (in the interests of better balancing of relevant private and public interests) be termed an \"intellectual monopoly privilege\" (IMP) has been advanced by several academics including Birgitte Andersen and Thomas Alured Faunce.\n\nSome critics of intellectual property, such as those in the free culture movement, point at intellectual monopolies as harming health (in the case of pharmaceutical patents), preventing progress, and benefiting concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses, and argue that the public interest is harmed by ever-expansive monopolies in the form of copyright extensions, software patents, and business method patents. More recently scientists and engineers are expressing concern that patent thickets are undermining technological development even in high-tech fields like nanotechnology.\n\nPetra Moser has asserted that historical analysis suggests that intellectual property laws may harm innovation:\nOverall, the weight of the existing historical evidence suggests that patent policies, which grant strong intellectual property rights to early generations of inventors, may discourage innovation. On the contrary, policies that encourage the diffusion of ideas and modify patent laws to facilitate entry and encourage competition may be an effective mechanism to encourage innovation.\n\nIn support of that argument, Jörg Baten, Nicola Bianchi and Petra Moser find historical evidence that especially compulsory licensing – which allows governments to license patents without the consent of patent-owners – encouraged invention in Germany in the early 20th century by increasing the threat of competition in fields with low pre-existing levels of competition.\n\nPeter Drahos notes, \"Property rights confer authority over resources. When authority is granted to the few over resources on which many depend, the few gain power over the goals of the many. This has consequences for both political and economic freedoms with in a society.\"\n\nThe World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) recognizes that conflicts may exist between the respect for and implementation of current intellectual property systems and other human rights. In 2001 the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued a document called \"Human rights and intellectual property\" that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product; in order to serve human well-being, intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws. According to the Committee, when systems fail to do so they risk infringing upon the human right to food and health, and to cultural participation and scientific benefits. In 2004 the General Assembly of WIPO adopted \"The Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization\" which argues that WIPO should \"focus more on the needs of developing countries, and to view IP as one of many tools for development—not as an end in itself\".\n\nFurther along these lines, The ethical problems brought up by IP rights are most pertinent when it is socially valuable goods like life-saving medicines are given IP protection. While the application of IP rights can allow companies to charge higher than the marginal cost of production in order to recoup the costs of research and development, the price may exclude from the market anyone who cannot afford the cost of the product, in this case a life-saving drug. \"An IPR driven regime is therefore not a regime that is conductive to the investment of R&D of products that are socially valuable to predominately poor populations\".\n\nLibertarians have differing views on intellectual property. Stephan Kinsella, an anarcho-capitalist on the right-wing of libertarianism, argues against intellectual property because allowing property rights in ideas and information creates artificial scarcity and infringes on the right to own tangible property. Kinsella uses the following scenario to argue this point:\n[I]magine the time when men lived in caves. One bright guy—let's call him Galt-Magnon—decides to build a log cabin on an open field, near his crops. To be sure, this is a good idea, and others notice it. They naturally imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But the first man to invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea. Clearly, this rule flies in the face of the first-user homesteading rule, arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights.\n\nThomas Jefferson once said in a letter to Isaac McPherson on August 13, 1813:\n\"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.\"\n\nIn 2005 the RSA launched the Adelphi Charter, aimed at creating an international policy statement to frame how governments should make balanced intellectual property law.\n\nAnother aspect of current U.S. Intellectual Property legislation is its focus on individual and joint works; thus, copyright protection can only be obtained in 'original' works of authorship.\n\nOther criticism of intellectual property law concerns the expansion of intellectual property, both in duration and in scope.\n\nIn addition, as scientific knowledge has expanded and allowed new industries to arise in fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, originators of technology have sought IP protection for the new technologies. Patents have been granted for living organisms, (and in the United States, certain living organisms have been patentable for over a century).\n\nThe increase in terms of protection is particularly seen in relation to copyright, which has recently been the subject of serial extensions in the United States and in Europe. With no need for registration or copyright notices, this is thought to have led to an increase in orphan works (copyrighted works for which the copyright owner cannot be contacted), a problem that has been noticed and addressed by governmental bodies around the world.\n\nAlso with respect to copyright, the American film industry helped to change the social construct of intellectual property via its trade organization, the Motion Picture Association of America. In amicus briefs in important cases, in lobbying before Congress, and in its statements to the public, the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual-property rights. In framing its presentations, the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor. Additionally Congress's awareness of the position of the United States as the world's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property. These doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry, lending the MPAA even more power and authority.\nThe growth of the Internet, and particularly distributed search engines like Kazaa and Gnutella, have represented a challenge for copyright policy. The Recording Industry Association of America, in particular, has been on the front lines of the fight against copyright infringement, which the industry calls \"piracy\". The industry has had victories against some services, including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company Napster, and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright. The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based digital rights management tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works. Laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act have been enacted that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the Copyright Directive. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the Conditional Access Directive of 1998 (98/84/EEC).

It is spoken in Khanty–Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets autonomous okrugs as well as in Aleksandrovsky and Kargosoksky districts of Tomsk Oblast in Russia. According to the 1994 Salminen and Janhunen study, there were 12,000 Khanty-speaking people in Russia.\n\nThe Khanty language has a large number of dialects. The western group includes the Obdorian, Ob, and Irtysh dialects. The eastern group includes the Surgut and Vakh-Vasyugan dialects, which, in turn, are subdivided into thirteen other dialects. All these dialects differ significantly from each other by phonetic, morphological, and lexical features to the extent that the three main \"dialects\" (northern, southern and eastern) are mutually unintelligible. Thus, based on their significant multifactorial differences, Eastern, Northern and Southern Khanty could be considered separate but closely related languages.\n\nCyrillic (version as of 2000)\n\nCyrillic (version as of 1958)\n\nLatin (1931–1937)\n\nThe Khanty written language was first created after the October Revolution on the basis of the Latin script in 1930 and then with the Cyrillic alphabet (with the additional letter for ) from 1937.\n\nKhanty literary works are usually written in three Northern dialects, Kazym, Shuryshkar, and Middle Ob. Newspaper reporting and broadcasting are usually done in the Kazymian dialect.\n\nKhanty is divided in three main dialect groups, which are to a large degree mutually unintelligible, and therefore best considered three languages: Northern, Southern and Eastern. Individual dialects are named after the rivers they are or were spoken on. Southern Khanty is probably extinct by now.\nThe Salym dialect can be classified as transitional between Eastern and Southern (Honti:1998 suggests closer affinity with Eastern, Abondolo:1998 in the same work with Southern). The Atlym and Nizyam dialects also show some Southern features.\n\nSouthern and Northern Khanty share various innovations and can be grouped together as Western Khanty. These include loss of full front rounded vowels: *üü, *öö, *ɔ̈ɔ̈ > *ii, *ee, *ää (but *ɔ̈ɔ̈ > *oo adjacent to *k, *ŋ), loss of vowel harmony, fricativization of *k to /x/ adjacent to back vowels, and the loss of the *ɣ phoneme.\n\nA general feature of all Khanty varieties is that while long vowels are not distinguished, a contrast between plain vowels (e.g. ) vs. reduced or extra-short vowels (e.g. ) is found. This corresponds to an actual length distinction in Khanty's close relative Mansi. According to scholars who posit a common Ob-Ugric ancestry for the two, this was also the original Proto-Ob-Ugric situation.\n\nPalatalization of consonants is phonemic in Khanty, as in most other Uralic languages. Retroflex consonants are also found in most varieties of Khanty.\n\nKhanty word stress is usually on the initial syllable.\n\n19 consonants are reconstructed for Proto-Khanty, listed with the traditional UPA transcription shown above and an IPA transcription shown below.\n\nA major consonant isogloss among the Khanty varieties is the reflexation of the lateral consonants, *ɬ (from Proto-Uralic *s and *š) and *l (from Proto-Uralic *l and *ð). These generally merge, however with varying results: /l/ in the Obdorsk and Far Eastern dialects, /ɬ/ in the Kazym and Surgut dialects, and /t/ elsewhere. The Vasjugan dialect still retains the distinction word-initially, having instead shifted *ɬ > /j/ in this position. Similarly, the palatalized lateral *ľ developed to /lʲ/ in Far Eastern and Obdorsk, /ɬʲ/ in Kazym and Surgut, and /tʲ/ elsewhere. The retroflex lateral *ḷ remains in Far Eastern, but in /t/-dialects develops into a new plain /l/.\n\nOther dialect isoglosses include the development of original *ć to a palatalized stop /tʲ/ in Eastern and Southern Khanty, but to a palatalized sibilant /sʲ ~ ɕ/ in Northern, and the development of original *č similarly to a sibilant /ʂ/ (= UPA: ) in Northern Khanty, partly also in Southern Khanty.\n\nThe Vakh dialect is divergent. It has rigid vowel harmony and a tripartite (ergative–accusative) case system: The subject of a transitive verb takes the instrumental case suffix \"-nə-\", while the object takes the accusative case suffix. The subject of an intransitive verb, however, is not marked for case and might be said to be \"absolutive\". The transitive verb agrees with the subject, as in nominative–accusative systems.\n\nVakh has the richest vowel inventory, with four reduced vowels and full . Some researchers also report .\n\nNotes:\n\nThe Kazym dialect distinguishes 18 consonants.\nThe vowel inventory is much simplified. Eight vowels are distinguished in initial syllables: four full and four reduced . In unstressed syllables, four values are found: .\n\nA similarly simple vowel inventory is found in the Nizyam, Sherkal, and Berjozov dialects, which have full and reduced . Aside from the full vs. reduced contrast rather than one of length, this is identical to that of the adjacent Sosva dialect of Mansi.\n\nThe Obdorsk dialect has retained full close vowels and has a nine-vowel system: full vowels and reduced vowels ). It however has a simpler consonant inventory, having the lateral approximants /l lʲ/ in place of the fricatives /ɬ ɬʲ/ and having fronted to /s n/.\n\nThe nominal suffixes include dual ', plural ', dative ', locative/instrumental '.\n\nFor example:\n\nSingular, dual, and plural possessive suffixes may be added to singular, dual, and plural nouns, in three persons, for 3 = 27 forms. A few, from \"məs\" \"cow\", are:\n\nThe personal pronouns are, in the nominative case:\nThe cases of \"ma\" are accusative \"manət\" and dative \"manəm\".\n\nThe demonstrative pronouns and adjectives are:\n\nBasic interrogative pronouns are:\n\nKhanty numerals, compared with Hungarian and Finnish, are:\nThe formation of multiples of ten shows Slavic influence in Khanty, whereas Hungarian uses the collective derivative suffix \"-van (-ven)\" closely related to the suffix of the adverbial participle which is \"-va (-ve)\" today but used to be \"-ván (-vén)\". Note also the regularity of \"house\" and \"hundred\".\n\nBoth Khanty and Mansi are basically nominative–accusative languages but have innovative morphological ergativity. In an ergative construction, the object is given the same case as the subject of an intransitive verb, and the locative is used for the agent of the transitive verb (as an instrumental) . This may be used with some specific verbs, for example \"to give\": the literal Anglicisation would be \"by me (subject) a fish (object) gave to you (indirect object)\" for the equivalent of the sentence \"I gave a fish to you\". However, the ergative is a morphological (marked using a case) only, not syntactic, so that, in addition, these may be passivized in a way resembling English. For example, in Mansi, \"a dog (agent) bit you (object)\" could be reformatted as \"you (object) were bitten, by a dog (instrument)\".\n\nKhanty is an agglutinative language and employs an SOV order.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20711479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20711479", "title": "Korean birthday celebrations", "text": "Korean birthday celebrations\n\nKorean birthday celebrations or Dol are one of the important facets of Korean culture. When a person reaches an important age in his or her life, Koreans have unique celebrations to mark these milestones. Dol has two meanings in Korean. The most common meaning is a child's first birthday or Doljanchi. It can also be used as a generic description for birthdays: Cheot-dol (first birthday), Du-dol (second birthday), Seo-dol (third birthday), etc.\n\n\"Dol\" (\"doljanchi\", or \"tol\") is probably one of the best-known of the Korean birthday celebrations. \"Dol\" is celebrated for the first birthday of a child. When Korea had little medicinal knowledge, many newborns would die from childhood diseases or because of Korea’s seasonal temperature differences. When a child lived to be a year old during that period, it was a very joyous occasion. \n\nThe first part of the \"dol\" celebration is prayer. Traditionally, Koreans would pray to two of the many Korean gods: \"Sanshin\" (the mountain god) and \"Samshin\" (the birth goddess). Koreans would prepare the praying table with specific foods: a bowl of steamed white rice, seaweed soup (miyeok-guk) and a bowl of pure water. Layered red bean rice cakes (\"samshin siru\") were placed next to the prayer table. The rice cakes were not shared outside the family; it was believed that sharing this particular item with people outside the family would bring bad luck to the child. After everything on the praying table was ready the mother (or grandmother) of the child would pray to \"Sanshin\" and \"Samshin\", placing her hands together and rubbing her palms. She would ask for her child's longevity, wish luck to the mountain god, and give thanks to the birth goddess. After she finished her prayer, she bowed to Samshin several times. Women were the only ones allowed to participate in this ceremony; men were forbidden to be part of the praying. When the praying ceremony commenced depended on the region. People from Seoul would pray in the early morning of the child's birthday; other regions prayed the night before. Today this part of the celebrations is usually skipped, because Muism (the religion that worshiped the Korean gods) is rarely practiced. \n\nBefore the main part of the celebration, the baby is dressed in very colorful, ornate clothing called \"dol-bok\". The \"dol-bok\" that the child wears differs according to the child’s sex. A boy would traditionally wear a pink or striped \"jogori\" (jacket) with purple or gray \"paji\" (pants), a striped \"durumagi\" (long jacket), a blue vest printed with a gold or silver pattern or a striped \"magoja\" (jacket), a \"jonbok\" (long blue vest) with a gold or silver pattern, a \"bokgun\" (black hat with long tail), and \"tarae-busun\" (traditional socks). A girl would wear a striped \"jogori\", a long red \"chima\" (skirt), a gold-and-silver printed \"jobawi\" (hat) and \"tarae-busun\". In addition to their \"dol-bok\", boys and girls would wear a long \"dol-ddi\" (belt that wraps around the body twice) for longevity and a \"dol-jumuni\" (pouch) for luck. The \"dol-jumuni\" would be made of fine silk, with a thread to open and close it. Buttons were not used in the \"dol-bok\", to symbolize longevity. \nThe \"Toljabee\" is the main celebration of \"Tol\". A large table is prepared with over a dozen different types of rice cakes or \"ddeok\" (the main food). Some types of \"ddeok\" are \"paekseolgi\" (white steamed rice cakes), \"susu-kyongdan\" (rice cakes coated with rough red bean powder), \"mujigae-ddeok\" (rainbow-colored steamed rice cakes) and \"gyep'i-ddeok\" (puffed-air rice cakes). Along with the \"deeok\", fruit is also served; the fruit on the table varies, depending on the season. There is also a bowl of rice and various other foods placed on the table. Food is not the only thing on the table, however; there is also a large spool of thread, a brush, a Korean calligraphy set, a pencil, a book, money (10,000-\"won\" bills) and a bow and arrow (or a needle, ruler and pair of scissors for girls). After the table is set, the parents sit the baby on a traditional Korean mattress (\"bolou\") and Korean cushions (\"bangsuk\"). This is done so that relatives can get better pictures of the infant. There is also a traditional screen in the background. The \"toljiabee\" then begins. The baby picks up various items on the table that attracts him or her. The items that the child picks up are said to predict the child’s future. If the child picks up the thread, the child will have a long life. A child who picks up the pencil, book or calligraphy set is forecast to be a good scholar. A child who picks the rice, rice cakes, or money will become rich; some say that choosing the rice (or a rice cake) means the child is unintelligent, or that they will never be hungry. If the ruler, pair of scissors or needle is chosen, it is said that the child will be dexterous. If the child chooses the knife, they will become a good chef. In the modern era, people often prepare modern objects such as sports equipment, a microphone, a stethoscope or a computer mouse, to symbolize modern talents. \n\nThe baby's well-being is celebrated 21 days after the birth with a meal of white rice, Miyeok guk (Miyeok seaweed soup), and Baekseolgi (white rice cake tteok). The Baekseolgi symbolizes sacredness. By this time, the baby and mother are still recovering from birth, so people were not allowed to see them. However, close family members are met and prayed for the healthy recovery of the baby's mother on this day.\n\nAnother birthday celebration is \"Baek-il\" (100th-day celebration). During this celebration, the family worships \"Samshin\". They make her offerings of rice and soup for having cared for the infant and the mother, and for having helped them live through a difficult period. They give thanks to \"Samshin\" and also pray for \"jae-ak\" (wealth), longevity, and \"cho-bok\" (traditional word for \"luck\"). After the prayer the family, relatives and friends celebrate with rice cakes, wine, and other delicacies such as red and black bean cakes sweetened with sugar or honey. In order to protect the child, red bean rice cakes are placed at the four compass points of the house. This not only brought protection, but was also believed to bring good fortune and happiness. It is widely believed that if 100 people share the rice cakes the child will live a long life, so the family would also send rice cakes to neighbors and others. Those who receive rice cakes return the dishes with lengths of thread (expressing the hope for longevity), rice and money (symbolizing future wealth).\n\nWhen a person turns 60, there was a celebration known as \"hwangap\". This was considered an auspicious year, since when someone turned 60 the sexagenary cycle of the Korean zodiac is complete. Each person is born under one of the twelve zodiac animals. It takes 60 years for the zodiac animal and the element under which one is born to align. Another reason that \"hwangap\" is so important is that many years ago (before the advent of modern medicine), it was uncommon for a person to live 60 years. There is a celebration; children honor their parents with a feast and merrymaking. Part of the celebration involves the children of the birthday celebrant; starting with the eldest, they bow and offer wine to their parents. After the children give their respects to their parents, their children show respect to them; again starting with the eldest, in the same way. While these rituals are being carried out, traditional music is played and professional entertainers sing songs, encouraging people to drink. In order to make the recipient of the \"hwangap\" feel young, adults and teens dress in children’s clothing. They also sing children's songs and dance children's dances.\n\nA less well-known birthday celebration is when a boy or girl reaches their adult age (20 for the boy and 15 for the girl). When a boy turned into an adult he would tie his hair into a top knot and be given a Gat (traditional cylindrical Korean hat made of horsehair). He would be required to lift a heavy rock as a test of his strength. If he can lift and move the rock, he is considered a man. A girl would become an adult by rolling her braided hair into a chignon bun and fixing it with a Binyeo, a long ornamental hairpin .\n\n"}

It was first published in 1716, and was followed by a revised edition in 1717.\n\nThe treatise was written to instruct keyboard players in performance practice, particularly for Couperin's \"Pièces de Clavecin\"; Couperin, upon its publication, noted that it was \"absolutely indispensable for playing my \"Pièces\" in the style most suitable to them\". \nWith the early music revival, it became one of the primary sources for the keyboard fingering system which prevailed in Europe during the Baroque era.

This is a date ordered list of those people and their brief stories.\n\nA retired French diplomatic agent in America, the gentleman gardener Monsieur Théodore Année of Passy, France brought back from his travels the seeds of several Canna species, and in 1848 he crossed C. \"glauca\" with C. \"indica\", so producing the first known and recorded Canna hybrid, C. x \"annaei\" André, now referred to as C. 'Annei'. Année was rapidly joined by many other enthusiasts and professional horticulturists as Canna hybrids enjoyed rapid popularity in France. In 1866 he retired to Nice, France and from there released his last recorded cultivar, C. 'Prémices de Nice'.\n\nA resident of Lyon, France.\n\nA resident of Paris, France.\n\nA resident of Lyon, France.\n\nResident of Lyon, France. Both supervisors of the Tete d’Or park.\n\nAmongst the professionals who joined in the enthusiasm for new Canna cultivars was the rose breeder Monsieur Antoine Crozy of Lyons, France, who first started hybridising Cannas in 1862 and continued introducing new canna cultivars at a rapid rate until his death in 1903, giving his name to a whole new group of floriferous Canna cultivars. Crozy aîné (French for \"elder\"), as he was universally known, was succeeded by his son, Michel Crozy (1871–1908). He was also accorded the nickname of \"Papa Canna\", as he was considered to be the father of Cannas. Unfortunately, no images of this remarkable man appear to have survived over the years.\n\nResident of Lyons, France.\n\nMessrs Wilhelm Pfitzer of Stadt Fellbach in Germany produced over 300 new cultivars up until the early 1950s. Many generations of the founder, Wilhelm, followed in the business, which is still in existence on a small scale. Wilhelm's son Walter took over control of the business in the 1870s until his death in 1931. Until then, Walter Pfitzer was still in demand judging at international fairs, exhibitions, and shows, retaining his Presidency and Vice Presidency of the German and British Gladiolus Societies respectively, right until the end. His continual interest in Cannas meant a steady supply of new cultivars being produced each year.\n\nIn 1933, there were about 150 employees worldwide. That same year, in order to celebrate the elevation of Fellbach to the status of a city, the firm named one of its best seedlings that year as Canna ‘Stadt Fellbach’, meaning ‘City of Fellbach’. That is still a popular cultivar in this day and age.\n\nWalter's children Paul, Anna & Rudolf followed their father into the business, but in the 1950s they were forced to abandon the breeding of Cannas, as the high cost of German labour meant that they could no longer compete with Mediterranean countries, who also enjoyed a more favourable climate.\n\nMessrs Vilmorin-Andrieux & Cie in France produced a considerable number of new cultivars during the last century.\n\nAlthough thought of primarily as rose hybridists, the US firm of Conard Pyle Co. also contributed large numbers of cultivars in the early part of the 1900s, under the guidance of its chief hybridist Antoine Wintzer. Wintzer worked in collaboration with Dr van Fleet, of the USDA, to produce many new Canna varieties.\n\nOne of Crozy's most beautiful creations was the cultivar Canna 'Madame Crozy', that has a beautiful crimson red colour with a golden margin. It was used by the Italian horticulturist Carl Spenger, from the Dammann establishments at San Giovanni a Teduccio near Naples, to create the \"Canna with orchid flowers\" or \"Italian Canna\", as they were known. Examples of varieties having the Canna hybrid Madame Crozy as a parent, are C. 'Austria' (1893), C. 'Italia' (1893), C. 'Alemania' (1894), C. 'Britannia' (1895), C. 'Heinrich Seidel'(1895). There is recorded knowledge of 57 cultivars originating from this prolific nursery, until its destruction by the eruption of the Mount Vesuvius volcano in the early 1900s.\n\nVictor Lemoine was a resident of Nancy, France and considered to be one of the greatest horticulturists of all time, and was the first foreigner to receive the Victorian Medal of Horticulture of the Royal Horticultural Society. He also received the George R. White Medal of Honor from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society.\n\nThe Agri Horticultural Society of India, located in Kolkata, India, firstly under the Secretaryship of Percy Lancaster in 1892 and later that of his son Sydney Percy-Lancaster, raised the Alipore Canna Collection, which dominated canna throughout that continent. Over 100 new varieties are known to have been raised by the society during that period, as well as importing the latest favourites from Europe and later from the USA.\n\nMr Luther Burbank was a celebrated horticulturist when in 1896 he released his first two Canna cultivars, C. ‘Tarrytown’ and C. ‘Burbank’. He is reputed to be the first to recognise and name the C. 'Roi Humbert' mutation, which he named as C. 'Yellow King Humbert'.\n\nHis known cultivars were all of the type found in the Italian Group of Cannas.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Rozain-Boucharlat establishments were prolific hybidists. Their nursery’s at Cuires-les-Lyon, France was the origin of many canna cultivars. Their catalog of the year 1910 documented 110 canna varieties, many of them being their own creations.\n\nOne of their principal successes was the obtaining of a pure pink colour which didn’t exist at that time (only pale pink and salmon pink existed). The obtaining of these cultivars C. ‘Francis Berthie’ and C. ‘Prince de Galles’ encouraged them to try for a purer colour. In 1922, the cultivar C. ‘Prince Charmant’ with its bright carmine pink colour brought the desired tone to the collection. This is still a popular cultivar, found in many collections.\n\nHowever, the improvements didn’t stop there and in 1930, the Rozain-Boucharlat’s variety C. 'Centenaire de Rozain-Boucharlat' appeared in their list. This variety which is small, floriferous, with big spikes and carmine, lilac shaded flowers is still found at many horticulturists' and cities’ green spaces. It was released in celebration of the first 100 years of the company.\n\nLongwood Gardens in the USA contributed a collection of Conservatory Group and Aquatic Group cultivars, originated by Dr Robert Armstrong the chief geneticist at Longwood Gardens, Pennsylvania, USA.\n\nAlthough best known for her Crinum cultivars, over the years Mrs Marcelle Sheppard has also hybridized a number of winning Cannas. One of the most exciting to look at is C. 'Zulu Rouge' with its dark (almost brown-black) foliage and bright red flowers. Many of her cultivars were distributed over the years by Herb Kelly Jr.\n\n\n\n"}

It was based on the theories of Jerome Bruner, particularly his concept of the \"spiral curriculum\". This suggested that a concept might be taught repeatedly within a curriculum, but at a number of levels, each level being more complex than the first. The process of repetition would thus enable the child to absorb more complex ideas easily.\n\nIn MACOS, the concept was \"the chain of life\" or a \"lifeline\": the entire history of a living thing. The course started with a simple lifespan in the form of the Pacific Coast salmon. It then moved on to the more complex life form of the herring gull, introducing concepts such as nurturing. The lifespan of the baboon was next examined, particularly within the societal context afforded by the baboon troop. The differences between innate behaviour and learned behaviour were introduced. Finally, the study opened up into a study of a man's lifespan with a case study of Netsilik Inuit. This also included the interaction between the Netsilik and other life forms, such as reindeer and seals.\n\nThe course comprised a self-contained kit of course materials, film cassettes, visual aids, and games. Some of the activities were very imaginative; a game based upon reindeer migration had a loaded die to introduce discussion about instincts, and a paper seal would be cut up and shared among class members representing various people in the Netsilik community, according to a ritual governing who was entitled to which part of the animal.\n\nThe emphasis of the course was upon learning particular skills within the teaching process, not upon the significance of the content. This included the necessity to ask questions, discuss, and reach conclusions based on evidence and argument.\n\nThe course was much criticized in the United States because of its emphasis upon questioning aspects of life, including belief and morality. It was particularly targeted by fundamentalist groups, evidenced by quotations included in the course booklet. In 2004, the National Film Board of Canada produced \"Through These Eyes\", a documentary about the controversy surrounding MACOS, and more generally about the interplay between politics and education.\n\n\n"}

The modern English name \"Korea\" is an exonym derived from the Goryeo period and is used by both North Korea and South Korea in international contexts. In the Korean language, the two Koreas use different terms to refer to the nominally unified nation: \"Chosŏn\" (, ) in North Korea and \"Hanguk\" (, ) in South Korea. Ethnic Koreans living in China and Japan also use the term \"Chosŏn\" to refer to Korea.\n\nThe earliest records of Korean history are written in Chinese characters called hanja. Even after the invention of hangul, Koreans generally recorded native Korean names with hanja, by translation of meaning, transliteration of sound, or even combinations of the two. Furthermore, the pronunciations of the same character are somewhat different in Korean and the various Korean dialects, and have changed over time.\n\nFor all these reasons, in addition to the sparse and sometimes contradictory written records, it is often difficult to determine the original meanings or pronunciations of ancient names.\n\nUntil 108 BC, northern Korea and Manchuria were controlled by Gojoseon. In contemporaneous Chinese records, it was written as , which is pronounced in modern Korean as \"Joseon\" (). The prefixing of \"Go-\" (), meaning \"ancient,\" is a historiographical convention that distinguishes it from the later Joseon Dynasty. The name Joseon is also now still used by North Koreans and Koreans living in China to refer to the peninsula, and as the official Korean form of the name of \"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\". The word is also used in many Eurasian languages to refer to the Korean Peninsula, such as Japanese, Vietnamese, and Chinese.\n\nPossibly the Chinese characters phonetically transcribed a native Korean name, perhaps pronounced something like \"Jyusin\". Some speculate that it also corresponds to Chinese references to (, suksin), (, jiksin) and (, siksin), although these latter names probably describe the ancestors of the Jurchen.\n\nOther scholars believe was a \"translation\" of the native Korean \"Asadal\" (), the capital of Gojoseon: \"asa\" being a hypothetical Altaic root word for \"morning\", and \"dal\" meaning \"mountain\", a common ending for Goguryeo place names.\n\nAn early attempt to translate these characters into English gave rise to the expression \"The Land of the Morning Calm\" for Korea, which parallels the expression \"The Land of the Rising Sun\" for Japan. While the wording is fanciful, the essence of the translation is valid.\n\nAround the time of Gojoseon's fall, various chiefdoms in southern Korea grouped into confederacies, collectively called the Samhan (, , \"Three \"Han\"\"). \"Han\" is a native Korean root for \"leader\" or \"great\", as in \"maripgan\" (\"king\", archaic), \"hanabi\" (\"grandfather\", archaic), and \"Hanbat\" (\"Great Field\", archaic name for Daejeon). It may be related to the Mongol/Turkic title \"Khan\".\n\n\"Han\" was transliterated in Chinese records as (, han), (, gan), (, gan), (, gan), or (, han), but is unrelated to the Chinese people and states also called Han, which is a different character pronounced with a different tone. (See: Transliteration into Chinese characters).\n\nBeginning in the 7th century, the name \"Samhan\" became synonymous with the Three Kingdoms of Korea. According to the Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa, Silla implemented a national policy, \"Samhan Unification\" (), to integrate refugees and migrants from Baekje and Goguryeo. In 1982, a memorial stone dating back to 686 was discovered in Cheongju with an inscription: \"The Three Han were unified and the domain was expanded.\" During the Later Silla period, the concepts of Samhan as the ancient confederacies and the Three Kingdoms of Korea were merged. In a letter to an imperial tutor of the Tang dynasty, Choe Chiwon equated Byeonhan to Baekje, Jinhan to Silla, and Mahan to Goguryeo. By the Goryeo period, Samhan became a common name to refer to all of Korea. In his Ten Mandates to his descendants, Wang Geon declared that he had unified the Three Han (Samhan), referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Samhan continued to be a common name for Korea during the Joseon period and was widely referenced in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty.\n\nIn China, the Three Kingdoms of Korea were collectively called Samhan since the beginning of the 7th century. The use of the name Samhan to indicate the Three Kingdoms of Korea was widespread in the Tang dynasty. Goguryeo was alternately called Mahan by the Tang dynasty, as evidenced by a Tang document that called Goguryeo generals \"Mahan leaders\" () in 645. In 651, Emperor Gaozong of Tang sent a message to the king of Baekje referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea as Samhan. Epitaphs of the Tang dynasty, including those belonging to Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla refugees and migrants, called the Three Kingdoms of Korea \"Samhan\", especially Goguryeo. For example, the epitaph of Go Hyeon (), a Tang dynasty general of Goguryeo origin who died in 690, calls him a \"Liaodong Samhan man\" (). The History of Liao equates Byeonhan to Silla, Jinhan to Buyeo, and Mahan to Goguryeo.\n\nThe \"Han\" in the names of the Korean Empire, \"Daehan Jeguk\", and the Republic of Korea (South Korea), \"Daehan Minguk\" or \"Hanguk\", are named in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula.\n\nAround the beginning of the Common Era, remnants of the fallen Gojoseon were re-united and expanded by the kingdom of Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. It, too, was a native Korean word, probably pronounced something like \"Guri\", transcribed with various hanja characters: , , or (, Goguryeo), (, Goryeo), (, Gori), or (, Guryeo).\nThe source native name is thought to be either *\"Guru\" (\"walled city, castle, fortress\"; attested in Chinese historical documents, but not in native Korean sources) or *\"Gauri\" (\"center, middle\"; cf. Middle Korean \"*gaβɔndɔy\" and Standard Modern Korean \"gaunde\" ).\n\nThe theory that Goguryeo referenced the founder's surname has been largely discredited (the royal surname changed from \"Hae\" to \"Go\" long after the state's founding).\n\nIn the south, the Samhan resolved into the kingdoms of Baekje and Silla, constituting, with Goguryeo, the Three Kingdoms of Korea. In 668, Silla unified the three kingdoms, and reigned as Later Silla until 935. The name Samhan became synonymous with the Three Kingdoms of Korea beginning in the 7th century, and by the Goryeo period it became a common name to refer to all of Korea.\n\nThe succeeding dynasty called itself Goryeo (, ), and regarded itself as the successor of Goguryeo. The name Goryeo (also spelled as \"Koryŏ\") was the shortened form of Goguryeo (also spelled as \"Koguryŏ\") and was first used during the reign of Jangsu in the 5th century. Through the Silk Road trade routes, Muslim merchants brought knowledge about Silla and Goryeo to India and the Middle East. Goryeo was transliterated into Italian as \"Cauli\", the name Marco Polo used when mentioning the country in his \"Travels,\" derived from the Chinese form \"Gāolí\".\n\nIn 1392, a new dynasty established by a military coup revived the name Joseon (, ). The hanja were often translated into English as \"morning calm/sun\", and Korea's English nickname became \"The Land of the Morning Calm\"; however, this interpretation is not often used in the Korean language, and is more familiar to Koreans as a back-translation from English. This nickname was coined by Percival Lowell in his book, \"Choson, the Land of the Morning Calm,\" published in 1885.\n\nIn 1897, the nation was renamed \"Daehan Jeguk\" (, , literally, \"Great Han Empire\", known in English as Korean Empire). \"Han\" had been selected in reference to \"Samhan\", specifically the Three Kingdoms of Korea, not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula. So, \"Daehan Jeguk\" (, ) means it is an empire that rules the area of Three Kingdoms of Korea. This name was used to emphasize independence of Korea, because an empire can't be a subordinate country.\n\nWhen the Korean Empire came under Japanese rule in 1910, the name reverted to \"Joseon\" (officially, the Japanese pronunciation \"Chōsen\"). During this period, many different groups outside of Korea fought for independence, the most notable being the Daehan Minguk Imsi Jeongbu (, ), literally the \"Provisional Government of the Great Han People's Nation\", known in English as the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea ( =  ‘people’ +  country/nation’ = ‘republic’ in East Asian capitalist societies).\n\nKorea became independent after World War II (1945) and the country was then divided.\n\nIn 1948, the South adopted the provisional government's name of Daehan Minguk (, ; see above), known in English as the Republic of Korea. Meanwhile, the North became the Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk (, ) literally the \"Chosŏn Democratic People Republic\", known in English as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The name itself was adopted from the short-lived People's Republic of Korea (PRK) formed in Seoul after liberation and later added the word \"democratic\" to its title.\n\nToday, South Koreans use \"Hanguk\" (, ) to refer to just South Korea or Korea as a whole, \"Namhan\" (, ; \"South Han\") for South Korea, and \"Bukhan\" (, ; \"North Han\") for North Korea. South Korea less formally refers to North Korea as \"Ibuk\" (, ; \"The North\"). South Koreans often refer to Korea as \"uri nara\" (), meaning \"our nation\" or \"our country\". In addition, the official name for the Republic of Korea in the Korean language is \"Daehan Minguk\" (, ; which is usually translated as \"The Republic of Korea\").\n\nNorth Koreans use \"Chosŏn\", \"Namjosŏn\" (, ; \"South Chosŏn\"), and \"Bukchosŏn\" (, ; \"North Chosŏn\") when referring to Korea, South Korea, and North Korea, respectively. The term \"Bukchosŏn\", however, is rarely used in the north, although it may be found in pre-war sources, such as the Song of General Kim Il-sung.\n\nIn the tourist regions in North Korea and the official meetings between South Korea and North Korea, \"Namcheuk\" (, ) and \"Bukcheuk\" (, ), or \"southern side\" and \"northern side\", are used instead of \"Namhan\" and \"Bukhan\".\n\nThe Korean language is called \"Hangukeo\" (, , referring to the Korean language) or \"Hangukmal\" (, , referring to spoken Korean only) in the South and \"Chosŏnmal\" (, ) or \"Chosŏnŏ\" (, ) in the North. The Korean script is called hangeul () in South Korea and \"Chosŏn'gŭl\" () in North Korea. The Korean Peninsula is called \"Hanbando\" (, ) in the South and \"Chosŏn Pando\" (, ) in the North.\n\nIn Chinese-speaking areas such as China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, different naming conventions on several terms have been practiced according to their political proximity to whichever Korean government although there is a growing trend for convergence.\n\nIn the Chinese language, the Korean Peninsula is usually called \"Cháoxiǎn Bàndǎo\" () and in rare cases called \"Hán Bàndǎo\" (). Ethnic Koreans are also called \"Cháoxiǎnzú\" (), instead of \"Dàhán mínzú\" (). However, the term \"Hánguó ren\" () may be used to specifically refer to South Koreans.\n\nBefore establishing diplomatic relations with South Korea, the People's Republic of China tended to use the historic Korean name \"Cháoxiǎn\" ( \"Joseon\" or \"Chosŏn\"), by referring to South Korea as \"Nán Cháoxiǎn\" ( \"South Joseon\"). Since diplomatic ties were restored, China has used the names that each of the two sides prefer, by referring to North Korea as \"Cháoxiǎn\" and to South Korea as \"Hánguó\" ( \"Hanguk\"). The Korean language can be referred to as either \"Cháoxiǎnyǔ\" () or \"Hánguóyǔ\" (). The Korean War is officially called the \"Kàngměi Yuáncháo Zhànzhēng\" ( \"War to Resist America and Aid Korea\") although the term \"Cháoxiǎn Zhànzhēng\" () is also used in unofficial contexts.\n\nTaiwan, on the other hand, uses the South Korean names, referring to North Korean as \"Běihán\" ( \"North Han\") and South Korean as \"Nánhán\" ( \"South Han\"). The Republic of China previously maintained diplomatic relations with South Korea, but has never had relations with North Korea. As a result, in the past, \"Hánguó\" () had been used to refer to the whole Korea, and Taiwanese textbooks treated Korea as a unified nation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China under the Democratic Progressive Party Government considered North and South Koreas two separate countries. However, general usage in Taiwan is still to refer to North Korea as \"Běihán\" ( \"North Han[guk]\") and South Korea as \"Nánhán\" ( \"South Han[guk]\") while use of – which in Taiwan is not pronounced \"Cháoxiǎn\" but \"Cháoxiān\" – is generally limited to ancient Korea. The Korean language is usually referred to as \"Hányǔ\" ().\n\nSimilarly, general usage in Hong Kong and Macau has traditionally referred to North Korea as \"Bak Hon\" ( \"North Han\") and South Korea as \"Nam Hon\" ( \"South Han\"). Under the influence of official usage, which is itself influenced by the official usage of the People's Republic of China government, the mainland practice of naming the two Koreas differently has become more common.\n\nIn the Chinese language used in Singapore and Malaysia, North Korea is usually called \"Cháoxiǎn\" ( \"Chosŏn\") with \"Běi Cháoxiǎn\" ( \"North Chosŏn\") and \"Běihán\" ( \"North Han\") less often used, while South Korea is usually called \"Hánguó\" ( \"Hanguk\") with \"Nánhán\" ( \"South Han[guk]\") and \"Nán Cháoxiǎn\" ( \"South Chosŏn\") less often used.\n\nIn Hokkien speaking areas of chinese communities in countries like Taiwan and around Southeast Asia, Korea is called \"Hân-kok\" ( \"Hanguk\") where North Korea is referred to as \"Pak-hân\" ( \"North Han\") and South Korea as \"Lâm-hân\" ( \"South Han\").\n\nThe above usage pattern does not apply for Korea-derived words. For example, Korean ginseng is commonly called \"Gāolì shēn\" ().\n\nIn Japan, North Korea is called \"Kita-Chōsen\" (; \"North Chosŏn\") and South Korea \"Kankoku\" ( \"Hanguk\").\n\nHowever, Japan-based North Koreans claim the name \"Kita-Chōsen\" is derogatory, as it only refers to the northern part of Korean Peninsula, whereas the government claims the sovereignty over its whole territory. Pro-North people such as Chongryon use the name \"Kyōwakoku\" (; \"the Republic\") instead, but the ambiguous name is not popular among others. In 1972 Chongryon campaigned to get the Japanese media to stop referring to North Korea as \"Kita-Chōsen\". This effort was not successful, but as a compromise most media companies agreed to refer to the nation with its full official title at least once in every article, thus they used the lengthy \"Kita-Chōsen (Chōsen Minshu-shugi Jinmin Kyōwakoku)\" ( \"North Chosŏn (The People's Democratic Republic of Chosŏn)\"). By January 2003, this policy started to be abandoned by most newspapers, starting with \"Tokyo Shimbun\", which announced that it would no longer write out the full name, followed by \"Asahi\", \"Mainichi\", and \"Nikkei\" \n\nFor Korea as a whole, \"Chōsen\" (; \"Joseon\") is commonly used. The term Chōsen, which has a longer usage history, continues to be used to refer to the Korean peninsula, the Korean ethnic group, and the Korean language, which are use cases that won't cause confusion between Korea and North Korea. When referring to both North Korean and South Korean nationals, the transcription of phonetic English \"Korean\" (, \"Korian\") may be used because a reference to a Chōsen national may be interpreted as a North Korean national instead.\n\nThe Korean language is most frequently referred to in Japan as \"Kankokugo\" () or \"Chōsengo\" (). While academia mostly prefers \"Chōsengo\", \"Kankokugo\" became more and more common in non-academic fields, thanks to the economic and cultural presence of South Korea. The language is also referred to as various combined terms, such as \"Kankoku-Chōsen-go\" (), \"Chōsen-Kankoku-go\" (), \"Kankokugo (Chōsengo)\" (), etc. Some people refer to the language as \"Koriago\" (), using the European name for Korea. This term is not used in ordinary Japanese, but was selected as a compromise to placate both nations in a euphemistic process called \"kotobagari\". Likewise, when NHK broadcasts a language instruction program for Korean, the language is referred to as \"hangurugo\" (; \"hangul language\"); although it's technically incorrect since hangul itself is a writing system, not a language. Some argue that even \"Hangurugo\" is not completely neutral, since North Korea calls the letter \"Chosŏn'gŭl\", not \"hangul\". \"Urimaru\" (), a direct transcription of \"uri mal\" (, \"our language\") is sometimes used by Korean residents in Japan, as well as by KBS World Radio. This term, however, may not be suitable to ethnic Japanese whose \"our language\" is not necessarily Korean.\n\n\"Uri\" (우리 \"we/us/our\") is the first-person plural pronoun and it is commonly used as a prefix in Korean terms to describe things that are Korean, such as \"uri nara\" (우리 나라, \"our country\") which is yet another name Koreans give their country.\n\nIn Japan, those who moved to Japan usually maintain their distinctive cultural heritages (such as the Baekje-towns or Goguryeo-villages). Ethnic Korean residents of Japan have been collectively called \"Zainichi Chōsenjin\" ( \"Joseon People in Japan\"), regardless of nationality. However, for the same reason as above, the euphemism \"Zainichi Korian\" (; \"Koreans in Japan\") is increasingly used today. \"Zainichi\" (; \"In Japan\") itself is also often used colloquially. People with North Korean nationality are called \"Zainichi Chōsenjin\", while those with South Korean nationality, sometimes including recent newcomers, are called \"Zainichi Kankokujin\" ( \"Hanguk People in Japan\").\n\nMongols have their own word for Korea: Солонгос (\"Solongos\"). In Mongolian, \"solongo\" means \"rainbow.\" And another theory is probably means derived from Solon tribe living in Manchuria, a tribe culturally and ethnically related to the Korean people. North and South Korea are, accordingly, Хойд Солонгос (\"Hoid Solongos\") and Өмнөд Солонгос (\"Ömnöd Solongos\").\nOther theory:\nThe name of either Silla or its capital Seora-beol was also widely used throughout Northeast Asia as the ethnonym for the people of Silla, appearing [...] as Solgo or Solho in the language of the medieval Jurchens and their later descendants, the Manchus respectively.\n\nIn Vietnam, people call North Korea ' (; \"Chosŏn\") and South Korea ' (; \"Hanguk\"). Prior to unification, North Vietnam used ' (; Bukchosŏn) and ' (; Namjoseon) while South Vietnam used ' (; Bukhan) and ' (; Namhan) for North and South Korea, respectively. After unification, the northern Vietnamese terminology persisted until the 1990s. When South Korea reestablished diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 1993, it requested that Vietnam use the name that it uses for itself, and ' gradually replaced ' in usage.\n\nIn the Vietnamese language used in the United States, \"Bắc Hàn\" and \"Nam Hàn\" are most common used.\n\nBoth South and North Korea use the name \"Korea\" when referring to their countries in English. North Korea is sometimes referred to as \"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" (DPRK) and South Korea is sometimes referred to as the \"Republic Of Korea\" (ROK). The official names of both entities are also used by organizations such as United Nations, International Olympic Committee and media such as the Associated Press, China Global Television Network, and several others. \n\nAs with other European languages, English historically had a variety of names for Korea. These included \"Cauli\" (Marco Polo's rendering of \"Goryeo\"), Caule, Core, Cory, Caoli, and Corai as well as two spellings that survived into the 19th century, Corea and Korea. The modern spelling, \"Korea\", first appeared in the late 17th century in the travel writings of the Dutch East India Company's Hendrick Hamel. The terms \"Chosunese\" or \"Chosonese\" were first used to refer to the people of Joseon in the late 19th century but were eventually phased out.\n\nDespite the coexistence of the spellings \"Corea\" and \"Korea\" in 19th-century English publications, Koreans believe that Japan, around the time of the Japanese occupation, intentionally standardised the spelling on \"Korea\", so that \"Japan\" would appear first alphabetically. Both major English-speaking governments of the time (i.e. the United States and the United Kingdom and its Empire) used both \"Korea\" and \"Corea\" until the early part of the colonial period. English-language publications in the 19th century generally used the spelling Corea, which was also used at the founding of the British embassy in Seoul in 1890. However, the U.S. minister and consul general to Korea, Horace Newton Allen, used \"Korea\" in his works published on the country. At the official Korean exhibit at the World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago in 1893 a sign was posted by the Korean Commissioner saying of his country's name that \"'Korea' and 'Corea' are both correct, but the former is preferred.\" This may have had something to do with Allen's influence, as he was heavily involved in the planning and participation of the Korean exhibit at Chicago. \n\nA shift can also be seen in Korea itself, where postage stamps issued in 1884 used the name \"Corean Post\" in English, but those from 1885 and thereafter used \"Korea\" or \"Korean Post\".\n\nBy the first two decades of the 20th century, \"Korea\" began to be seen more frequently than \"Corea\" – a change that coincided with Japan's consolidation of its grip over the peninsula. Most evidence of a deliberate name change orchestrated by Japanese authorities is circumstantial, including a 1912 memoir by a Japanese colonial official that complained of the Koreans' tendency \"to maintain they are an independent country by insisting on using a C to write their country's name.\" However, the spelling \"Corea\" was occasionally used even under full colonial rule and both it and \"Korea\" were largely eschewed in favor of the Japanese-derived \"Chosen\", which itself was derived from \"Joseon\".\n\nEuropean languages use variations of the name \"Korea\" for both North and South Korea. In general, Celtic and Romance languages spell it \"Corea\" (or variations) since \"c\" represents the /k/ sound in most Romance and Celtic orthographies. However, Germanic and Slavic languages largely use variants of \"Korea\" since, in many of these languages, \"c\" represents other sounds such as /ts/. In languages using other alphabets such as Russian (Cyrillic), variations phonetically similar to \"Korea\" are also used for example the Russian name for Korea is Корея, romanization Koreya. Outside of Europe, most languages also use variants of \"Korea\", often adopted to local orthographies. \"Korea\" in the Jurchen Jin's national language (Jurchen) is \"Sogo\". \"Korea\" in the conlang Esperanto is \"Koreio\". \"Korea\" in Hmong is \"Kauslim\". Within Spain, the Basque Country and Navarre regions use the spelling \"Korea\" in their Basque language, while the rest of the country uses \"Corea\", but this usage is related to national language politics rather than international usage.\n\nEmigrants who moved to Russia and Central Asia call themselves \"Goryeoin\" or \"Koryo-saram\" (; ; literally \"person or people of Goryeo\"), or \"Koreytsi\" () in Russian. Many Goryeoin are living in the CIS, including an estimated 106,852 in Russia, 22,000 in Uzbekistan, 20,000 in Kyrgyzstan, 17,460 in Kazakhstan, 8,669 in Ukraine, 2,000 in Belarus, 350 in Moldova, 250 in Georgia, 100 in Azerbaijan, and 30 in Armenia. As of 2005, there are also 1.9 million ethnic Koreans living in China who hold Chinese citizenship and a further 560,000 Korean expatriates from both North and South living in China.\n\nKorean Americans may refer to themselves as Jaemigyopo (; , or \"temporary residents in America\"), or sometimes simply \"gyopo\" for short.\n\nIn traditional Korean culture, as well as in the cultural tradition of East Asia, the land of Korea has assumed a number of sobriquets over the centuries, including:\n\n\n"}

Similar to reincarnation, naparay holds that lives are cyclic and that attributes of previous lives may carry over to a new life. \n\nIts followers may invoke ritual practices to determine if a young child is in fact an \"elder\" - including rituals undertaken while the future mother is pregnant. In naparay, all people are considered to have had previous lives. However, the extent to which they carry their past lives with them into the present is determined by these ritual practices. A newborn with the capability, or \"life force\", of an elder may be deferred to as an elder, for example being called \"Baba\" (father, elder) and be trained to lead ceremonies at a young age. Naparay is seen as the method by which ancient knowledge is passed on to present society. Rituals and prayer are performed during early pregnancy to guide the vital force of the recently deceased toward the new child.\n\nWestern anthropologists believe than naparay limits the accumulation of power among a small group within a community. Attributing wisdom and experience to the young allows new and competing leaders to emerge. Anthropologists also note that nothing in the mythology of naparay prevents females from being considered to possess a strong \"life force\" in equality with males, yet the culture almost always attributes strong naparay to males only.\n\n"}
{"id": "276308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276308", "title": "Old Norse orthography", "text": "Old Norse orthography\n\nThe orthography of the Old Norse language was diverse, being written in both Runic and Latin alphabets, with many spelling conventions, variant letterforms, and unique letters and signs. In modern times, scholars established a standardized spelling for the language. When Old Norse names are used in texts in other languages, modifications to this spelling are often made. In particular, the names of Old Norse mythological figures often have several different spellings.\n\nThe appearance of Old Norse in a written runic form first dates back to approximately 200–300 A.D. While there are remains of Viking runestones from the Viking Age today they are rare, and vary in use of orthography depending on when they were created. Rune stones created near the end of the Viking Age tend to have a greater influence from Old English runes.\n\nAn understanding of the writing system of Old Norse is crucial for fully understanding the Old Norse language. Studies of remaining rune stones from the Viking Age reveal many nuances about the spoken language, such as the constant use of alliteration. A comparison of various whetstones from this time period with the works of Snorri Sturluson reveal that alliteration was common in many Old Norse writings, and were not only present in skaldic works. This would then suggest that the Vikings closely tied their language to their auditory sense, which in turn would have helped with the continual transfer of their cultural memory, which was also closely tied to their language.\n\nThe following table gives various attested spellings of sounds and their IPA transcription. In general usage, an orthographic distinction of phones or phonemes is not necessarily held by every writer. For example, an author may only distinguish some vowels by length, and orthographic devices could be mixed and matched. Where the table lists a long-or-short phoneme /(ː)/, a specifically short // or long /ː/ phoneme represents additional spellings not covered by length marking rules. Likewise, a phonetic entry only lists spellings not used by the equivalent phoneme(s). N/A is used when no specific spelling is used, e.g. where all long vowel spellings are found using the rules for deriving long vowel spellings from the short vowel, or no general spelling is used, e.g. when short and long vowels are always spelled differently.\n\nLegend:\n\nThe low/low-mid vowels may be indicated differently:\n\nDialect-specific sounds:\n\nWhen dialectal mergers such as OEN monophthongization took place, regional spelling often changed to reflect this. Sometimes, both phonemes' spellings would be used, but confused.\n\nThe epenthetic vowel had different regional spellings. In East Norse it was commonly spelled as or , while in West Norse it was often spelled , almost always so in Iceland.\n\nThe original Icelandic manuscripts which are the main source of our knowledge of Norse mythology did not employ a unified system of spelling. During the Viking Age, many dialects of Old Norse were spoken. While they appear to have been mutually intelligible, the slight variances resulted in various spelling. Thus the same name might be spelled several different ways even in the original manuscripts. Letters unique to the language existed, such as a modified version of the letter Wynn called Vend that was used briefly for the sounds , , and . In particular, the length of vowels was only sporadically marked in many manuscripts and various umlauted vowels were often not distinguished from others. Another complication is that several shortcut forms for common words, syllables, and grammatical endings developed. One example is the use of the rune named ' (man) for the word '. Another is the use of a special glyph for the various r-endings so common in Old Norse. These scribal abbreviations are categorized as follows:\n\n\nThese abbreviation conventions and a majority of the signs are inherited from the Latin language itself, and were common to the Latin alphabet in other languages. However, other signs or conventions are specifically Norse, such as the \" zig-zag.\n\n\"Normalized spelling\" can be used to refer to normalization in general or the standard normalization in particular. With normalized spelling, the manuscript spelling is altered to adhere to be more strict and regular. These respellings are designed to be phonemically precise rather than representative of the manuscripts. The degree of normalization may vary, but in general the text is at the end reduced to limited deviation from a regularized system, perhaps at the expense of some dialectal character.\n\nFor various reasons 19th century scholars came up with a standardized normalization of Old Norse which remains in use. It is primarily based on the so-called First Grammatical Treatise. Vowel length is marked and umlauted vowels are unambiguously represented. The standardized spelling employs a few characters that are not available in the most common electronic character sets. Replacements are often used, particularly in electronic formats. The most consequential is the use of ö instead of ǫ.\n\nThe following table associates the phonemes of the language to its orthographic representations. Vowel nasalization and length are not distinguished in the table when distinguished in neither orthography, nor is distinguished from .\n\n\nWhen transcribing Old Norse texts from Danish and Swedish runestones, many scholars, but not all, use an orthography that is adapted to represent Old East Norse, the dialect of Old Norse in Denmark and Sweden. The main differences are the diphthong \"æi\" instead of \"ei\" as in ' (\"stone\") and \"i\" instead of the glide \"j\" as in ' (\"payment\"). In this standard, the u-umlauted \"a\" represented by ǫ is not usually considered, but rendered as the underlying \"a\", as in the name '. Another difference is the representation of the phoneme ʀ\"', instead of simply \"r\" as in West Norse, where the \"ʀ\" phoneme merged with \"r\" earlier. However, even if they render the transcription according to the local pronunciation, the Rundata project presents personal names according to the previously mentioned standardized spelling in English translations. Here follows an example from the Orkesta Runestone (U 344):\n\nStandardized spelling:\nThe rendering of Old East Norse:\nBut when translating into English, the standardized spelling is used:\n\nIn many modern Icelandic publications of Old Norse works, the modern Icelandic spelling is used. The orthography is essentially the same, but changes from Old Norse phonology to Icelandic phonology are incorporated in the translation that may not have been in the source text. One such difference is the insertion of u before r, when it is preceded by a consonant at the end of the word. Thus the Old Norse name Baldr comes out as Baldur in modern Icelandic. Other differences include vowel-shifts, whereby Old Norse \"ǫ\" became Icelandic \"ö\", and Old Norse \"œ\" became Icelandic \"æ\". Old Norse \"ø\" corresponds in modern Icelandic to \"ö\", as in \"sökkva\", or to \"e\", as in \"gera\"). There is also consonant lenition of final \"k\" and \"t\" to \"g\" and \"ð\", e.g. \"mig\" for earlier \"mik\" and \"það\" for earlier \"þat\". These distinct features are summarized in the table below:\n\nFor the convenience of English writers and readers the Old Norse characters not used in English are commonly replaced with English ones.

One-man bands also often sing while they perform. \n\nThe simplest type of \"one-man band\" is a singer accompanying themselves on acoustic guitar and playing a harmonica mounted in a metal \"harp rack\" below the mouth. This approach is often taken by buskers and folk music singer-guitarists. More complicated setups may include wind instruments strapped around the neck, a large bass drum mounted on the musician's back with a beater which is connected to a foot pedal, cymbals strapped between the knees or triggered by a pedal mechanism, tambourines and maracas tied to the limbs, and a stringed instrument strapped over the shoulders (e.g., a banjo, ukulele or guitar). \n\nSince the development of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) in the 1980s, musicians have also incorporated chest-mounted MIDI drum pads, foot-mounted electronic drum triggers, and electronic pedal keyboards into their set-ups. In the 2000s and 2010s, the availability of affordable digital looping pedals has enabled singer-musicians to record a riff or chord progression and then solo or sing over it.\n\nThe earliest known records of multiple musical instruments being played at the same time date from the 13th century, and were the pipe and tabor. The pipe was a simple three-holed flute that could be played with one hand; the tabor is more commonly known today as a snare drum. This type of playing can still be heard in parts of rural France, in England and Spain. An Elizabethan-era woodcut shows a clown playing the pipe and tabor. An 1820s watercolour painting shows a one-man band with a rhythm-making stick, panpipes around his neck and a bass drum and tambourine beside him. Henry Mayhew's history of London street life in the 1840s and 1850s described a blind street performer who played bells, the violin and accordions.\n\nGuitarist Jim Garner played guitar with his hands and triangle with his feet, and Will Blankenship of the Blankenship Family of North Carolina played harmonica, autoharp and triangle in shows during the 1930s. In the 1940s, entertainer and clown Benny Dougal used a crude \"stump fiddle\" (a single string stretched on a stick) with a footpedal-operated pair of cymbals. Blues singers such as \"Daddy Stovepipe\" (Johnny Watson) would sing, play guitar, and stomp their feet for rhythm, or used a foot pedal to play bass drum or cymbal.\n\nOne of the earliest modern exponents of multiple instruments was Jesse Fuller. Fuller developed a foot-operated bass instrument which he called the \"footdella\", which had six bass strings which were struck by hammers. In \"one-man-band\" shows, Fuller would use his \"footdella\", a footpedal-operated \"sock\" (bass drum), a homemade neck harness (for a harmonica, kazoo and microphone), and a 12-string guitar. Fate Norris, of the Skillet Lickers, a hillbilly string band of the 1920s and early 1930s developed a geared mechanical contraption with footpedals that enabled him to play guitar, bells, bass fiddle, fiddle, autoharp and mouth harp.\n\nJoe Barrick, who was born in Oklahoma in 1922, wanted a way of accompanying himself on fiddle, so he built a contraption with a guitar neck on a board with footpedals to operate the notes. Subsequent versions of this \"piatar\" also had bass guitar and banjo necks and a snare drum which are played by foot-operated hammers. To change notes on the guitar-family instruments, a foot treadle operates a mechanical fretting device. Two notable one-man blues bands active in Memphis in the 1950s were Doctor Ross and Joe Hill Louis, playing guitar, harmonica and bass drum/high-hat.\n\nThe simple guitar and harmonica combination (as used by such musicians as Tex Williams, Anton Newcombe, Jimmy Reed, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray Dorset of Mungo Jerry) is so common now that it is rarely considered to be a one-man band. British-born Don Partridge made the classic one-man band outfit (bass drum on the back, guitar and harmonica) famous in the streets of Europe, and was an early busker to enter the Top Ten of the UK Singles Chart, with his hit singles \"Rosie\" and \"Blue Eyes\" in 1968. Modern one-man bands include such performers as Ben de la Garza, Hasil Adkins and Sterling Magee, better known as \"Mister Satan,\" from Satan and Adam. \n\nThe term \"one-man band\" is also colloquially used to describe a performer who plays every instrument on a recorded song one at a time, and then mixes them together in a multitrack studio. While this approach to recording is more common in electronica genres such as techno and acid house than traditional rock music, some rock performers such as Joe Hill Louis, Stevie Wonder, Prince, Lenny Kravitz, Paul McCartney, Kabir Suman, Dave Edmunds, John Fogerty, Emitt Rhodes, Todd Rundgren, Steve Winwood, Roy Wood, Nik Kershaw, and Les Fradkin have made records in which they play every instrument (one after the other). Mike Oldfield was noted for using this recording technique during the recording of his 1973 album \"Tubular Bells\". Other examples of a one-man band in the recording studio are Dave Grohl for the first studio album by the Foo Fighters, Trent Reznor for Nine Inch Nails, jazz piano player Keith Jarrett for his album \"No End\", Peter Tagtgren for Pain (musical project), Chris Carrabba for the first two albums released by Dashboard Confessional, Varg Vikernes for Burzum and Billy Corgan for Smashing Pumpkins since 2009.\n\nNash the Slash (1948-2014) played all instruments on his recordings. He also played solo concerts from 1975 to 2012, using synchronized drum machines and synthesizers as he plays either an electric violin or electric mandolin. Some artists record and mixed their music in a multitrack studio and synchronize it with video multitrack video playing on all instruments, creating a one-man band illusion.\n\nOne-man bands in this context have become more common in extreme metal, especially black metal, where a number of bands apart from Burzum consist of only one member. Such artists include Nargaroth, Xasthur, Falkenbach, Arckanum, Nortt, Horde, and others. While most of these bands do not play live, some such as Nargaroth hire additional musicians for live performances.\n\n\"One-woman band\" is not used very often in the vernacular, but women have increasingly had a presence as musicians in most forms of music. Examples of one-woman bands are Merrill Garbus, who performs as Tune-Yards and plays every instrument on all recordings , and Edith Crash who creates \"dark and haunting, drawn-out melodies\".\n\nIn the 2000s, as digital looping pedals became widely available, performers have been able to use a mixture of previously recorded music, delay effects, and looping devices in live performances of everything from beatboxing to classical violin. Live looping performers create layered looped accompaniment for musical solos that are sung or played later in the song. Using this technology, a simultaneous combination of various instruments and vocals, or one instrument played in different ways, can be created over the course of one musical piece which rivals the sounds of studio recording. Notable artists who incorporate this technique live include Ed Sheeran, Keller Williams, That 1 Guy, Zach Deputy, and KT Tunstall. Rick Walker is another looper and multi-instrumentalist who has organized looping festivals, including a long-running annual one in Santa Cruz, California, and others in various countries.\n\nSince the development of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) in the 1980s, musicians have also incorporated chest-mounted MIDI drum pads, foot-mounted electronic drum triggers. Some \"one-man bands\" use organ-style pedal keyboards to perform basslines. A small number of MIDI enthusiasts use custom-made MIDI controllers connected to different parts of their bodies to trigger music on synthesizers. Custom-made MIDI controllers range from wind-operated controllers to small triggers mounted on the arms or feet. At a certain point, the use of body MIDI controllers may come to resemble performance art, because the musical sounds are triggered by the performer assuming certain poses or dancing. One of the pioneers of this performance art is McRorie Live Electronic, who uses drum sensors on his shoes, tom sensors on his chest, separate rhythm and bass keyboards and vocal lead instruments.\n\nWith the use of 2000s-era digital loop pedals, which can record and then repeat a short musical phrase, performers can play a riff or groove and then solo over the repeated loop. An example of this technique is by Canadian musician Jay Robinson who creates full band arrangements live.\nWith the rise in availability and affordability of electronic devices came innovation with the traditional acoustic \"one-man band\" instruments. One example is the Farmer Musical Instrument Co! based in the US. Pete Farmer sells acoustic foot-played percussion instruments that allow musicians to play a range of traditional drum kit sounds, the foot drum Deluxe, or tambourine and shaker pedals for tapping out simple beats. With the development of technology and prominence of video sharing sites like YouTube, musicians are now able to record each instrument individually and then compile a video as if it were all done in real time.\n\nThe term is also used in a general sense to refer to a person who runs a small business alone (a sole-proprietorship business), particularly if the operation requires that person to assume multiple different roles, in a manner akin to the way a musical \"one-man band\" performer plays different instruments and sings at the same time. In some small businesses, the owner also produces the product or service, markets it and delivers it to clients. In TV news, the phrase refers to a reporter who also functions as her own cameraperson via the use of a tripod.\n\nIn 2011, professional wrestler Heath Slater climbed to fame with the nickname \"The One-Man Rock Band\", which was later changed to \"The One-Man Southern Rock Band\" in reference to him being billed from West Virginia.\n\n"}

The essay was then published in 1913 in \"Les Cahiers d’aujourd’hui\" in French as \"Ornement et Crime\". Only in 1929 was the essay published in German in the \"Frankfurter Zeitung\", as \"Ornament und Verbrechen\". It was the architect Henry Kulka, who assisted Loos during a reprint of the essay in 1931 in \"Trotzdem\", that altered the original year to 1908 after he consulted Loos, who either didn't remember well or wanted to assume primacy in the confrontation against the Secessionists.\n\nThe essay was written when Art Nouveau—known as Secession in Austria and which Loos had excoriated even at its height in 1900—was showing a new way forward for modern art. The essay is important in articulating some moralizing views, inherited from the Arts and Crafts movement, which would be fundamental to the Bauhaus design studio, and would help define the ideology of modernism in architecture.\n\n\"The evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects,\" Loos proclaimed, thus linking the optimistic sense of the linear and upward progress of cultures with the contemporary vogue for applying evolution to cultural contexts. Loos's work was prompted by regulations he encountered when he designed a tailorshop without ornamentation next to a palace. He eventually conceded to requirements by adding a flowerpot.\n\nIn the essay, Loos explains his philosophy, describing how ornamentation can have the effect of causing objects to go out of style and thus become obsolete. It struck him that it was a crime to waste the effort needed to add ornamentation, when the ornamentation would cause the object to soon go out of style. Loos introduced a sense of the \"immorality\" of ornament, describing it as \"degenerate\", its suppression as necessary for regulating modern society. He took as one of his examples the tattooing of the \"Papuan\" and the intense surface decorations of the objects about him—Loos says that, in the eyes of western culture, the Papuan has not evolved to the moral and civilized circumstances of modern man, who, should he tattoo himself, would either be considered a criminal or a degenerate.\n\nLoos never argued for the complete absence of ornamentation, but believed that it had to be appropriate to the type of material.\n\nLoos concluded that \"No ornament can any longer be made today by anyone who lives on our cultural level ... Freedom from ornament is a sign of spiritual strength\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41793290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41793290", "title": "Personality in animals", "text": "Personality in animals\n\nPersonality in animals has been investigated across a variety of different scientific fields including; agricultural science, animal behaviour, anthropology, psychology, veterinary medicine, and zoology. Thus, the definition for animal personality may vary according to the context and scope of study. However, there is recent consensus in the literature for a broad definition that describes animal personality as individual differences in behaviour that are consistent across time and ecological context. Here, consistency refers to the repeatability of behavioural differences between individuals and not a trait that presents itself the same way in varying environments.\n\nAnimal personality traits are measurable and are described in over 100 species. Personality in animals has also been referred to as animal disposition, coping style, and temperament. There are also personality norms through the species, often found between genders. The diversity of animal personality can be compared in cross-species studies, demonstrating its pervasiveness in the evolutionary process of animals. Research on animal personality variation has been burgeoning since the mid 1990s. Recent studies have focused on its proximate causation and the ecological and evolutionary significance of personality in animals.\n\nThe extent of personality phenomenon considered when examining animal personality is significantly reduced compared to those studied in humans. Concepts such as personal objects, identity, attitudes and life stories are not considered relevant in animals. Similarly, any approach that requires the subject to explain motives, beliefs or feelings is not applicable to the study of animal behaviour.\n\nThe study of animal personality is largely based on the observation and investigation of behavioural traits. In an ecological context, traits or ‘characters’ are attributes of an organism that are shared by members of a species. Traits can be shared by all or only a portion of individuals in a population. For example, studies in animal personality often examine traits such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty, boldness, exploration and sociality.\n\nThe initial framework used to study animal personality was comparative psychology. The descriptive language used by comparative psychologists in the late nineteenth century often attributed disposition and behavioural tendencies to individual animals in their studies. Many of these reports are the result of researchers anthropomorphizing the animal subjects and did not explicitly examine what is now considered animal personality. However, these studies do represent the some of the first instances of scientists reporting individual differences in animal behaviour.\n\nThe Russian physiologist, Ivan Pavlov, was one of the first researchers to integrate personality into his research of animal behaviour. In his seminal studies on conditional reflexes, he categorized the behaviour of dogs as Excitable, Lively, Quiet or Inhibited. He linked these personalities to learning ability. The Excitable type, for example, showed signs of strong excitatory conditioning, but a limited ability for the acquisition of inhibitory connections. The Lively type was the most balanced and displayed rapid associative learning, while the Quiet type exhibited consistent but slow learning.\n\nThe first study that empirically examined animal personality was in 1938, Meredith Crawford quantified individual differences in the behaviour of young chimpanzee using a behaviour rating scale. Crawford conducted his research out of the Yale Laboratories of Primate Biology. Since then, psychologists have continued to investigate personality in animals across a wide range of taxa. Meanwhile, the incorporation of animal personality into the fields of ecology and evolution is a relatively new practice. Ecologist began to recognize the importance of individual differences in behaviour near the end of the twentieth century.\n\nRating traits involve a group of observers that scrutinize the behavioural traits of an individual animal. Observers are typically given a list of characters and/or descriptions to use as a reference for interpreting animal behaviour then use the list to rate the behaviours. The rating method uses observers and data recording instruments.\n\nResearchers will observe how individual animals respond to behavioural tests and code their reactions. This method is typically used in experimental studies in which environmental conditions are heavily manipulated.\n\nAs research in animal personality became more prevalent in ecological studies many behavioural ecologists were substituting behavioural plasticity for animal personality. That is, attributing variation in behaviour to diverse personality types rather than plasticity in a single behavioural trait. Thus, behavioural reaction norms were introduced as a means of incorporating personality and individual plasticity in the study of animal behaviour. Behavioural reaction norms measure the behaviour of an individual over an environmental gradient, therefore providing information on how an animal behaves on average and how their behaviour changes across an environmental gradient.\n\nRepeatability refers to the fraction of variation in a population that is owed to differences between individuals. Repeatability estimates are one of the most widely used statistical tools that can quantify consistent individual differences in behaviour. Formally,formula_1Where, formula_2 is variance among individuals and formula_3 is the variance within individuals over time. In a meta-analysis of published, peer-reviewed repeatability estimates, reviewers found that, in general, approximately 35% of behavioural variation among individuals could be attributed to individuals differences.\n\nThe Five Factor Model, or the Big Five personality trait model, has been used to assign personality archetypes to some animals. The 5 categories for the five factor model for personality are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Each of these categories identifies personality factors at the broadest level of abstraction. Because the assessment of personality using the five factor model is often a self-reported measure for humans, applying this model to animals can be difficult to standardize. Researchers often measure personality by assessing the behavior of the being over a period of time to establish the pattern. Naturally, some animals may not have as wide a range of personality as humans do. The species of the animal determines how the personality manifests itself. Likewise, a species may be predisposed to exhibit a category of personality more than other categories. So far, chimpanzees are the only animal shown to exhibit conscientiousness. Chimpanzees are also the only non-human species shown to demonstrate a hierarchical structure of personality, with two dimensions of affect corresponding to negative and positive emotionality, and a third dimension of disinhibition (vs. constraint), which is thought to comprise a regulatory system that is known to play a role in the perception and interpretation of incoming stimuli.\n\nNeuroticism, agreeableness and extraversion are the most commonly found personality traits among measured animals. For example, chimpanzees show emotional stability, agreeableness and surgency, audiovisual reactivity, affect-extraversion, excitability-agitation, aggression affinity and social play.\n\nSome behaviours are correlated into a set of personality traits that remain constant throughout different situations and contexts. These traits are referred to as behavioural syndromes. For example, the aggressiveness-boldness syndrome refers to the correlation between an individuals aggressiveness with conspecifics and boldness in novel environments.\n\nMany correlated behaviours are species specific. For instance, a study in 2014 reported that for horses, personality (quantified using a validated questionnaire) and tolerance to pain (using a Likert scale) indicated that neuroticism is negatively related to stoicism whereas extroversion was positively related to levels of expressed lameness. This suggests that pain may be more easily identified in highly extrovert horses. In zebrafish (\"Danio rerio\"), Proactive and Reactive personalities express different thermal preferences and general activity within the temperature gradient. Proactive fish (more aggressive, bold risk-takers, prone to routine formation) have a preference for higher temperature environments. Reactive fish (shy, less risk-prone, more flexible) favor medium colder temperatures.\n\nThe degree of variation in a population has been determined to influence to direction and outcome of natural selection. Most scientific research has focused on genetic and phenotypic variation or differences in resource use; however, variation in consistent behaviours (i.e. personality) also has important evolutionary consequences. For example, personality in animals can affect the way individuals interact with their environment and with each other which can affect the relative fitness of individuals. Therefore, personality can influence selection. Also, behavioural traits are more dynamic which may allow an animal to adapt more quickly which, in turn, can speed up the rate of evolution.\n\nFurther, natural or artificial selection cannot act on personality unless there is a mechanism for its inheritance. In rhesus macaques (\"Maccaca mulatta\"), the personality traits of Meek, Bold, Aggressive, Passive, Loner and Nervous have heritability values of 0.14 to 0.35, thus indicated that there is some genetic basis to the expression of personality traits in animals. In apes, including humans, heritability estimates of personality dimensions range from 0.07 to 0.63. In horses, heritability estimates range mostly between h=0.15 and h=0.40 for traits assessed in personality tests. Values at this level are considered as \"promising\" for artificial selection.\n\nPersonality in animals has been studied across a wide array of taxa. Some of these studies have investigated personality in mammals, elasmobranchs, reptiles, fish and birds, to name just a few. \n\nMore specifically, there have been several studies that have either been notable in that they have changed scientific understandings of animal personality or have applications in the field of human personality. For example, the study of personality in chimpanzees by King and Figueredo in 1997 was one of the first studies to apply the five-factor model in animal personality. It demonstrated the existence of personality traits in animals and provided a foundation for similar assessment strategies in future studies of personality in animals. Similarly, zebrafish have been used as a neurobehavioral model species for studying personality using the trait approach in non-human animals. These studies can then be translated to study personality development and personality disorders in humans.\n\nAnother general example is the spider, \"Anelosimus studiosus.\" This spider forms groups in which some females show an aggressive personality type and engage more in colony defence and prey capture, while others are docile and engage more in brood care. Groups containing both these two different personalities have better fitness than groups of only one personality type. This is because aggressive females are more efficient at foraging, web construction and defence, while docile females are better at raising the young. When groups contain a mix of both personalities, overall group performance is improved benefiting all group members. In the social spider \"Stegodyphus dumicola\" individuals differ in their boldness, with bolder individuals having a greater risk appetite. Boldness changes were found to relate to social interactions with nest mates, indicating that individual personality is more plastic in groups.\n\nMany researchers are critical of the lack of consistency in the terminology surrounding animal personality. For example, temperament, behavioural syndrome, disposition and animal personality have been used interchangeably by some while others maintain that each term has a unique meaning. Additionally, there is some concern that researchers may be misinterpreting the relationship between personality and behavioural plasticity. The behavioural ecologist, Dr. Niels Dingemanse, illustrates that one could erroneously determine that variation in behaviour between individuals exists if the subjects have not been examined across a gradient of ecological contexts and urges fellow researchers to apply behavioural reaction norms whenever possible. In addition, because of critical anthropomorphism, ethology, and comparative psychology are relatively unknown concepts to the layman, there are critics that question the validity in the claim that animals have a personality schema. There are those that fear that, while assessing behaviors, researchers will project anthropomorphic ratings onto the animals.\n"}

Talen began to perform his poems and stories, hitch-hiking from Philadelphia to New York to San Francisco.\n\nTalen's chief collaborator in developing the Reverend Billy character was the Reverend Sidney Lanier, a cousin of Tennessee Williams. Lanier was vicar of The St. Clement's in the 1960s, an Episcopal Church in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan. In an effort to increase attendance at St. Clement's, Lanier had torn out the altar and pews, inviting actors to perform scenes from plays by Tennessee Williams and Terrence McNally, and founding founding the American Place Theater. Lanier described Talen as \"more of a preacher with a gift for social prophecy than an actor.<nowiki>\"</nowiki> In the early 1990s Talen moved with Lanier to New York City from the San Francisco Bay Area, branding his act as a \"new kind of American preacher\"\n\nThe Reverend Billy character debuted on the sidewalk at Times Square in 1998, outside the Disney Store, where he proclaimed Mickey Mouse to be the anti-Christ. He was arrested multiple times outside the Disney Store, where he duct-tapped Mickey Mouse to a cross. Reverend Billy's sermons decried the evils of consumerism and the racism of sweatshop labor, and what Talen saw as the loss of neighborhood spirit in Rudolph Giuliani's New York.\n\nThe Reverend Billy character isn't so much a parody of a preacher, as a preacher motif used to blur the lines between performance and religious experience. \"It's definitely a church service,\" Talen explained to \"Altnernet\", but, he added, it's \"a political rally, it's theater, it's all three, it's none of them.\" Alisa Solomon, the theater critic at the Village Voice, said of Reverend Billy's persona, \"The collar is fake, the calling is real.\" Along with the Church of Stop Shopping, they have been referred to by academics as \"performance activism,\" \"carnivalesque protest,\" and \"commercial disobedience.\"\n\nSavitri D (née Durkee) is the co-founder and director of the Church of Stop Shopping, as well as Talen's partner. She was born in Taos, New Mexico in 1972. She was raised at The Lama Foundation, one of the earliest and longest lasting intentional spiritual communities in the US, founded by her parents, Steven and Barbara Durkee. \n\nSavitri D began dancing and performing at the University of Montana, studied at the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, and co-founded a dance collective called The Zen Monkey Project. After moving to New York City in 1997, she staged her play SKY/NO SKY at 57 Walker Street.\n\nIn 2000, she was a producer at The Culture Project, a theater in the East Village, where Talen was staging early Reverend Billy performances. She took over direction of The Church of Stop Shopping performances from the dramatist Tony Torn in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001, and married Talen the next year.\n\nUnder Savitri D's leadership, the Church won the Alpert Award for Theater and the Edwin Booth Award from the City University of New York.\n\nThe Stop Shopping Choir is a 35-member ensemble that performs an array of original gospel songs in theater performances and alongside Reverend Billy in public spaces during campaigns. The choir began accompanying Talen's sermons at concert shows shortly after the September 11 attacks, adding a musical influence to Reverend Billy performances. Led by musical director Nehemiah Luckett, the choir members are volunteers who rehearse weekly at the Lower Eastside Girl's Club in the East Village.\n\nThe Choir often write songs that draw attention to the environmental and consumerist campaigns championed by the Church of Stop Shopping. They have accompanied Talen into the lobbies of multinational banks such as JP Morgan Chase or research facilities belonging to Monsanto, dressed as golden toads and honeybees, singing songs in support of the day's sermon. One of their best-known songs is The First Amendment, an incantation of the 1st Amendment of the United States Constitution, sung rapturously by soprano Laura Newman.\n\nIn addition to protest performances throughout a given year, Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping have organized various campaigns focused on consumerist or environmental issues, often highlighting a particular company they feel best symbolizes the issue. The group stage actions in public spaces near the targets of their actions, or in the lobbies, halls, and plazas of the building owned by the companies they protest. Their sermons and songs routinely draw the attention of police and security forces assigned to those spaces, leading to arrests and significant media coverage. Talen and Savitri D have been arrested more than 50 times during their actions, though their charges are almost always reduced or dropped.\n\nReverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping staged numerous actions around New York City in their formative years. In 2000, after performing a Christmas show the New School's Tishman Auditorium, Reverend Billy led the congregation and members of the audience from the stage to the Poe House on West 3rd Street in Manhattan's West Village. There, the Reverend held a protest reading of \"The Raven\" atop the scaffolding over the soon-to-be-demolished home where Edgar Allen Poe had finished writing the famous poem. After the reading, Talen was arrested and jailed.\n\nAfter September 11, the Church and Choir met routinely in the Path Station near Ground Zero and sang the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution into their phones as commuters passed by. The crowd of singers sometimes reached up to 200 participants.\n\nOn June 29, 2007, just before the start of the monthly Critical Mass bike ride, Reverend Billy and Savitri D recited the First Amendment repeatedly to police officers through a megaphone in Manhattan's Union Square. Reverend Billy was arrested on charges of second-degree harassment. The civil liberties lawyer Norman Siegel defended Reverend Billy in court, saying \"Reverend Billy has a First Amendment right to recite the First Amendment.\"\n\nThe Church of Stop Shopping staged a series of actions across the country from 2002 to 2008, protesting against what they call Starbucks company's enactment of \"fake bohemia.\" Reverend Billy and the singers tried to \"exorcise the demon of cookie-cutter capitalism\" from its cash registers, by laying hands on the register, weeping, and harmonizing.\n\nThe Starbucks coffee chain has been a frequent target of the Church's actions, due to displacement of small local businesses, union busting, and exploitation of coffee farmers.\n\nIn 2002, Starbucks branches throughout New York City issued a document to its workers entitled \"What Should I do If Reverend Billy Is in My Store?\", which outlines an evacuation protocol and a series of scripted reassurances that workers are ordered to deliver to disturbed or inquisitive customers. The title of the document is also the title of a book written by Talen, published by The New Press.\n\nIn 2004, Starbucks persuaded a Los Angeles judge to issue an injunction against Talen, demanding that he cease and desist from \"stalking, contacting, or sexually harassing the computerized cash registers of the Starbucks Company.\"\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, Reverend Billy and the Church focused on the extinction of species brought by climate change, specifically targeting banks they said financed projects that worsened global warming. The symbolic centerpiece of these campaigns was the extinct Golden toad, originally native to Monteverde cloud forest in Costa Rica and a symbol for the crisis of declining amphibian species. Savitri D and the choir wore papier mâché masks depicting golden toads as they entered JP Morgan Chase and HSBC banks. \n\nIn one action in a Chase bank in New York City, Reverend Billy and choir director Nehemiah Luckett were arrested and charged with riot, trespass, unlawful assembly, and disorderly conduct. According to the bank manager in a complaint to police, Reverend Billy and the choir were \"running about the bank while wearing frog masks … jumping on to the bank's furniture, running about the bank, and screaming loudly at others for a number of minutes.\" The manager also stated that he thought the bank was being robbed, that he feared for his safety, and that customers or bank employees even cried.\n\nDespite the complaints against them and what the New York prosecutor called a \"criminal stunt,\" demanding that Talen go to prison for a year, their charges were eventually dropped.\n\nAs part of the Church of Stop Shopping's efforts to urge art institutions to reject sponsorship from petroleum companies, they have protested at a number of museums around the world. \n\nIn July 2011, while on tour in the UK, Reverend Billy and the Choir staged an action at the Tate Modern in London to protest its sponsorship by the oil company British Petroleum (BP). The church was invited by a coalition of UK groups, including Liberate Tate, BP or Not BP, Platform, UK Tar Sands Network, London Rising Tide, Art Not Oil and Climate Rush.\n\nWhile crowds observed the scene in the Turbine Room of the Tate, the choir splashed Reverend Billy and the BP sunflower logo with bottles of black oil. After the performance, the protesters exited the museum singing onto the lawn outside, and rallied on the shore of the Thames against oil companies and their involvement in the arts.\n\nIn 2014, Reverend Billy, Savitri D and the Choir turned their focus to colony collapse disorder affecting the world's honeybees. In one action, they entered the Micro-robotics Laboratory at Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Science to confront scientists working on the invention of robot pollinators, popularly known as RoboBees. They purchased fruits and vegetables to place before a display case with a model of the RoboBee, singing and lamenting the focus of scientists replacing living bees with robots, rather than solving the collapse. \n\n“We ask you to place your genius, your research, your scientific know-how into \"saving\" the honeybee,\" Talen said to those assembled. Attending the event and writing for The New Yorker, Elizabeth Kolbert noted the confusion among some of the Harvard graduate students witnessing the singing and preaching. \"We like people not to know if we're a political rally, a religious service, or a theatrical comedy about a church,\" Reverend Billy told Kolbert. \"If they have all three spinning in their head, and they can't settle on one, then they're probably having a raw experience.\"\n\nThe Church of Stop Shopping has also targeted chemical manufacturer Monsanto for its production of glysophate herbicides and neonicotinoid pesticides. In November 2014, the Church traveled to Monsanto's headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri, where they held an \"Organic Thanksgiving.\"\n\nIn 2015, Reverend Billy & The Stop Shopping Choir opened a series of shows for Neil Young during his tour in support of \"The Monsanto Years\".\n\nOn October 13, 2016, Reverend Billy was arrested while protesting the World Food Prize in Des Moines, Iowa. He was charged with trespass for leaving the \"free speech area\" set up near the event. The prosecutor for the state requested \"that the Court preclude evidence or argument regarding 'free speech rights,' 'free expression,'right to assemble,' and/or other First Amendment arguments and evidence that 'free speech rights' can constitute 'justification' under the Iowa's criminal trespass statute, Iowa Code §716.7 (2015).\" The judge in the case ultimately dismissed the charges. \n\nIn 2016, the Church released a guide called \"The United States Map of Poisoned Parks and Playgrounds,\" which shows the dosage and location of glyphosate applications around the U.S.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18018389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18018389", "title": "Simply Music", "text": "Simply Music\n\nSimply Music is a music education institution licensing teachers at over 700 locations in twelve countries. Australian music educator Neil Moore founded it on the core belief that all humans are naturally musical. Simply Music offers programs for students from birth through old age, with the stated goal that \"students acquire and retain music as a lifelong companion.\" Simply Music patterns its approach after primary language acquisition, where speaking comes first. In this it shares some philosophical ground with other developmental approaches like Kodály, Orff-Schulwerk, and the Suzuki Method.\n\nNeil Moore began constructing the Simply Music method in the late 20th century while teaching piano to a young blind student. Since traditional music-reading would not serve this student, Moore designed a program based on his own childhood musical experiences. Instead of reading music, as a child Moore had naturally visualized patterns within the songs and on the keyboard. He explained these building blocks to this student, who learned to play piano himself and began teaching the songs to his four-year-old sister, who was also blind.\n\nThis spurred Moore to begin testing his ideas more widely, and he found this approach natural and successful for students of all ages and abilities. Other piano teachers began learning from Moore. When he could no longer personally train them all, Moore founded the Simply Music organization and developed a remote certification program that is currently available to teachers in twelve countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nLater, Simply Music expanded to include early childhood music education, and also worked with Karen Nisenson to create Simply Music Gateway, an adaptive piano curriculum for children with special needs.\n\nSimply Music's founding premise is similar to Shin'ichi Suzuki’s claim that any child can learn music. But Simply Music extends the concept, like researchers E. McPherson Gary E. McPherson and Graham F. Welch, who write that it is our \"birthright\" to \"be able to communicate and interact musically with others.\" In the same degree, Simply Music declares musicality essential to human nature. Adherents identify many everyday activities as fundamentally musical because these activities thoughtlessly fall into patterns of rhythm and pitch. As examples they cite speaking, walking, and brushing teeth. Simply Music seeks both to draw on and to nurture this natural ability by distilling musical concepts into simple patterns.\n\nStudents use these patterns to begin playing songs in their first lessons. This method is modeled after primary language acquisition, where learners begin by speaking. Many other music education approaches—including Orff Schulwerk and the Dalcroze, Kodály, and Suzuki methods—engage students physically first and teach notation later. The complete Simply Music program aims to teach music for generalists, who may or may not later choose a specialty such as performing classical music, playing keyboard in a band, or accompanying soloists or theater performers. The program attempts to prepare students with a solid music background that can take them where they choose. The primary goal is for students to keep music in their life, most often for relaxation and enjoyment at home or with family and friends. As such, Simply Music includes a wide variety of musical genres, such as classical, blues, jazz, and popular.\n\nSimply Music does not focus on mastering classical concert performance technique. Instead, Simply Music teachers encourage students to play expressively and comfortably, without tension.\n\nThe Simply Music approach contrasts with many other music learning methods, where the ability to play music depends first on learning to read music. Moore terms these traditional methods \"reading-based \"and his approach \"playing-based\".\n\nThe core playing-based piano pieces are presented in the Foundation Program, a series of 9 levels of 7-10 songs each. The pieces are designed to provide experience with many musical styles and genres, to build students’ physical dexterity at the piano, and to give students hands-on familiarity with fundamental musical concepts.\n\nAlongside the Foundation Program, and often using concepts from the Foundation pieces, students learn arrangement, improvisation, composition, chord-reading, and theory. Teachers are required to present all these programs, as they are considered essential to a well-rounded music education.\n\nSimply Music maintains that their approach—based on learning to recognize patterns inherent in music—is distinct from learning by rote or by ear. Students learn through patterns on the keyboard, in their fingers, and in the music itself. Students learn the physical shape that a melody line or a chord forms in the hand or on the keyboard. For example, a basic triad such as D Major is seen as a triangle shape on the keyboard, with the two white notes forming the base and the black note at the top. Musical patterns include concepts like repeated rhythmic or melodic patterns (or sequences), melodic sentences, musical forms such as ABA, and chord progressions like the 12-bar blues.\n\nExperience with these concepts provides a foundation for learning note-reading during the second year. Simply Music first teaches rhythm notation, followed by pitch reading, and then applies these skills to pieces written in standard music notation. Students learn to read pitches by identifying intervals, rather than individual note-names. This is known as an \"intervallic \"approach. Simply Music also uses what they call \"generative \"learning, meaning that students write music as an integral part of learning to read music.\n\nAs students further expand their musicianship, they move into the Development Program, which applies their musical understanding and note-reading skills to increasingly complex written music. Lessons continue to include arrangement, improvisation, composition, chord-reading, and theory. At this phase, students also explore their own musical interests in more depth.\n\nSimply Music piano may be taught in either shared or private lessons. The early childhood program is taught in small groups.\n\nSimply Music partners with an affiliate young childhood music education program, Lynn Kleiner's Music Rhapsody.\n\nMusic Rhapsody is a music and movement program for infants through age five. Early childhood music education specialist Lynn Kleiner based the program on the Orff Schulwerk philosophy. In keeping with its roots, the program focuses on learning through play and addresses each stage of child development. The program immerses children in music-making through diverse songs, instruments, movement, puppets and visuals. By building a foundation in music and incorporating Simply Music repertoire, it prepares students to transition into the piano program.\n\nAll the Simply Music programs use a variety of multimedia materials to provide multisensory learning. Simply Music Piano and Accordion students use written music as well as other written materials to remember assignments and track their progress. Video recordings distill the main points of every lesson. Audio recordings help students become familiar with the songs, refine style and technique, and develop ensemble skills. Teacher training is also presented through multimedia materials.\n\nEarly childhood Music Rhapsody students use a wide variety of specially designed instruments along with movement materials, puppets, and visuals. The program also provides audio recordings for students and teachers, as well as video support for teachers.\n\nThe Simply Music Piano and Accordion repertoire covers a broad range of styles, including classical, contemporary, jazz, blues, gospel, and other styles from around the world. In addition to the core Foundation pieces, students learn arrangements of each piece, along with accompaniments, teacher-selected written pieces, student-choice songs, and student compositions.\n\nA student’s personal repertoire is called their Playlist. A Playlist is considered essential, partly because a large and varied repertoire helps facilitate lifelong musical engagement. Also, each new piece builds on musical concepts from earlier pieces.\n\nThe Music Rhapsody curriculum centers around children’s music, both traditional and contemporary, and also introduces many styles including classical, jazz, blues, and international music.\n\n"}

The food was believed to absorb the sins of a recently deceased person, thus absolving the soul of the person. Sin-eaters, as a consequence, carried the sins of all people whose sins they had eaten. Cultural anthropologists and folklorists classify sin-eating as a form of apotropaic ritual and religious magic.\n\nAlthough the figure of the sin-eater has had various references in modern culture, the questions of how common the practice was, what regions of the world in which it was most common, and what the interactions between sin-eaters, common people, and religious authorities were, remain largely unstudied and in the realm of folklore.\n\nIn mythology, Tlazolteotl, the Aztec goddess of earth, motherhood and fertility, had a redemptive role in the religious practices of the Meso-American civilization. At the end of an individual's life, he was allowed to confess his misdeeds to this deity, and according to legend she would cleanse his soul by \"eating its filth\".\n\nJesus of Nazareth has been interpreted as a universal archetype for sin-eaters, offering his life to atone or purify all of humanity of their sins.\n\nJohn Bagford, (ca.1650–1716) includes the following description of the sin-eating ritual in his \"letter on Leland’s Collectanea\", i. 76. (as cited in Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, 1898)\nA local legend in Shropshire, England, concerns the grave of Richard Munslow, who died in 1906, said to be the last sin-eater of the area:\nThe 1926 book \"Funeral Customs\" by Bertram S. Puckle mentions the sin-eater:\nHowlett mentions sin-eating as an old custom in Hereford, and thus describes the practice: \"The corpse being taken out of the house, and laid on a bier, a loaf of bread was given to the sin-eater over the corpse, also a maga-bowl of maple, full of beer. These consumed, a fee of sixpence was given him for the consideration of his taking upon himself the sins of the deceased, who, thus freed, would not walk after death.\"\n\nThe 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" states in its article on \"sin eaters\":\n"}

Their productions in the fields of theater, the narrative, the drawing, the cinema, the television and especially in the poetry, have been widely recognized and disseminated, even several decades after its dissolution. It was disbanded in the mid-1960s, and the components continued writing independently. The group's name is \"papel\" (paper in Spanish) and \"pola\" (\"cerveza\" or beer).\n\nThe group's regular payroll poetic Los Papelípolas is limited to six authors: Gustavo Andrade (highlighted in the fields of drama prize, winner in France, Spain, Costa Rica, among others, in film as screenwriter of the film \"The River of the Tombs\"; librettist of radio, television and short film director and producer of \"La Cantina de José Dolores\"). The others were apathetic to the events and to the movies, but with valuable works: Angel Sierra Basto (pseudonym of Victor Manuel Cortes Vargas, poet, education engine in the Huila, and politician, author of \"Dimensions\", 1963 and \"Xenias & Apophoretas of Menein Laos\", 1994), Dario Silva Silva (poet and current Archbishop of House on the Rock, one of the forty most influential men of Colombia according to \"Semana\" magazine); Ruben Morales Buendía (erotic poet and one of the first cartoonists Huila), Julian Polanía Perez (poet and politician, author of \"The concept of Grief\", 1958, and \"Narration of the Living Faces\", 1963) and Luis Ernesto Luna (poet, bureaucrat, dedicated to political propaganda, author of \"Memory of Silence\", 1988). Delimiro Moreno in his work \"The Papelípolas, Poetic Essay on a Generation\" (1995) added to Armando Ceron Castillo (author of \"Beyond Words\", 2010 ) and then talked about Camilo Lara Cuenca as an appendix of them, with a recently published poetic production (\"Así Canta mi Lira\", 2005), almost posthumously. The themes and style of these poets were always very heterogeneous group, as their spiritual and political ideology.\n\nTwo of them, especially with shared affinities with the Beat Generation: Angel Sierra Basto and Luis Ernesto Luna.\n\nThe label of \"movement\", may be inaccurate. The ideals and artistic group shares similarities with the Beat Generation and The Hungry Generation. The papelípolas Angel Sierra Basto and Luis Ernesto Suarez alluded to Nirvana, the Upanishads, Buddhism, to free sexuality, alcohol and drugs as leaks. Other reasons given for giving the label of movement (as Colombian Beat generation, which it shares with the nothingness Antioquia), was that none of its members turned professional as a response to the educational model of unbridled capitalism. For some, a result of their political ideology, for others, economic limitations, but it is common. All this feeds the decadence French Huysmans (as evident in the prologue of \"dimensions\" of Angel Sierra Basto by Luis Ernesto Suarez and the Thebaid of \"Ananké\"), French writers Charles Baudelaire (\"Les Fleurs du mal\"), Gérard de Nerval, Arthur Rimbaud and Parnasianism of Paul Verlaine, also at Nicaraguan literary modernism Rubén Darío. Sierra Basto, the more Beat of all, tried to deconstruct the language with their Rhymes Rune, and other poems full of neologisms. Meanwhile, the founder of The Papelípolas, Gustavo Andrade was counter to provincial level, with his first Manifesto Papelípolas, letter to Ramiro Bahamón by the poet Silvia Lorenzo to national poets gathered in Medellín in 1958, and published this year in the first of three Notebooks Huila group:\" Concept of Grief\" with poems Julian Perez Polanía, also with his essay\" Neiva needs a mayor who wants to Neiva\" and enjoying universal recognition plays like cutting.\n\nThe artistic value of the Papelípolas, was the subject of several pages of authors like David Rivera Moya, Roger Echavarria, Oliver Lis, Delimiro Moreno, Félix Ramiro Losada and Jorge Guebely. However, the label \"movement\" has been accepted by custom, though its definition has been as diverse and controversial.\n\nThe First Manifesto of Papelípolas was a letter from Gustavo Andrade to Ramiro Bahamón, which was filed with the acquiescence of the group by the poet Silvia Lorenzo before nadaístas poets among others in Medellín in 1958. This manifesto was published in the first of three books published huilenses that (his first broadcast medium), edited by Gustavo Andrade,\" Concept of Grief\" of Julian Perez Polanía.\n\nInput publications in literary tradition were undoubtedly the Notebooks Huila, achieved by successfully managing Gustavo Andrade Rivera to Intercol (International Petroleum Co.) and then the Echoes Magazine night baccalaureate José María Rojas Garrido with Angel Sierra Basto in the lead editorial in the year 1963 and 1964.\n\nSelect publications:\n\nAll six poets published in the Journal of the Huila.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the group were other publications, among which are:\n\n\nThe solution was placed according to a newspaper article from the 70's attributed to Luis Ernesto Suarez, about the year 1962, claim that we know is false, because the third Huilense \"Notebook\" that is the Angel Sierra Basto \"Dimensions\" is the year 1963, as \"Narration of the Living Faces\" of Julian Polanía Perez. The solution is given almost equal to the group Beat and beatnik, in the sixties, immersed in countercultural movements. It could happen in the year 1964, with the departure of Gustavo Andrade of Colombia to Costa Rica, hoping some of consecrated as playwright abroad (which succeeded being awarded the prize of the Paris Theatre, among others), or the death of Julian Perez Polanía in a car accident in 1965.\n\nIn 2013, the writer and filmmaker Oliver Lis and the Spanish producer Blanca Rosa de Aguilar, began shooting the film \"The Papelípolas, Twilight of a Poetic Generation\" with the survivors Armando Ceron Castillo and Dario Silva Silva. Colombian-French-Spanish production, attended by the former Minister of Justice of Colombia, Guillermo Plazas Alcid, the former governor of Huila, Julio Enrique Ortiz, and the writers Jorge Guebely Ortega and Delimiro Moreno, as the descendants of the poets.

The opera's official premiere was at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York City on 31 December 1879, where the show was well received by both audiences and critics. Its London debut was on 3 April 1880, at the Opera Comique, where it ran for 363 performances, having already been playing successfully for more than three months in New York.\n\nThe story concerns Frederic, who, having completed his 21st year, is released from his apprenticeship to a band of tender-hearted pirates. He meets Mabel, the daughter of Major-General Stanley, and the two young people fall instantly in love. Frederic soon learns, however, that he was born on the 29th of February, and so, technically, he has a birthday only once each leap year. His indenture specifies that he remain apprenticed to the pirates until his \"twenty-first birthday\", meaning that he must serve for another 63 years. Bound by his own sense of duty, Frederic's only solace is that Mabel agrees to wait for him faithfully.\n\n\"Pirates\" was the fifth Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration and introduced the much-parodied \"Major-General's Song\". The opera was performed for over a century by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in Britain and by many other opera companies and repertory companies worldwide. Modernized productions include Joseph Papp's 1981 Broadway production, which ran for 787 performances, winning the Tony Award for Best Revival and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical, and spawning many imitations and a 1983 film adaptation. \"Pirates\" remains popular today, taking its place along with \"The Mikado\" and \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" as one of the most frequently played Gilbert and Sullivan operas.\n\n\"The Pirates of Penzance\" was the only Gilbert and Sullivan opera to have its official premiere in the United States. At the time, American law offered no copyright protection to foreigners. After the pair's previous opera, \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", achieved success in London in 1878, approximately 150 American companies quickly mounted unauthorised productions that often took considerable liberties with the text and paid no royalties to the creators. Gilbert and Sullivan hoped to forestall further \"copyright piracy\" by mounting the first production of their next opera in America, before others could copy it, and by delaying publication of the score and libretto. They succeeded in keeping for themselves the direct profits of the first American production of \"The Pirates of Penzance\" by opening the production themselves on Broadway, prior to the London production, and they also operated profitable US touring companies of \"Pirates\" and \"Pinafore\". However, Gilbert, Sullivan, and their producer, Richard D'Oyly Carte, failed in their efforts, over the next decade, to control the American performance copyrights to \"Pirates\" and their other operas.\n\nFiction and plays about pirates were ubiquitous in the 19th century. Walter Scott's \"The Pirate\" (1822) and James Fenimore Cooper's \"The Red Rover\" were key sources for the romanticised, dashing pirate image and the idea of repentant pirates. Both Gilbert and Sullivan had parodied these ideas early in their careers. Sullivan had written a comic opera called \"The Contrabandista\", in 1867, about a hapless British tourist who is captured by bandits and forced to become their chief. Gilbert had written several comic works that involved pirates or bandits. In Gilbert's 1876 opera \"Princess Toto\", the title character is eager to be captured by a brigand chief. Gilbert had translated Jacques Offenbach's operetta \"Les brigands\", in 1871. As in \"Les brigands\", \"The Pirates of Penzance\" absurdly treats stealing as a professional career path, with apprentices and tools of the trade such as the crowbar and life preserver.\n\nWhile \"Pinafore\" was running strongly at the Opera Comique in London, Gilbert was eager to get started on his and Sullivan's next opera, and he began working on the libretto in December 1878. He re-used several elements of his 1870 one-act piece, \"Our Island Home\", which had introduced a pirate \"chief\", Captain Bang. Bang was mistakenly apprenticed to a pirate band as a child by his deaf nursemaid. Also, Bang, like Frederic in \"The Pirates of Penzance\", had never seen a woman before and felt a keen sense of duty, as an apprenticed pirate, until the passage of his twenty-first birthday freed him from his articles of indenture. Bernard Shaw believed that Gilbert drew on ideas in \"Les brigands\" for his new libretto, including the businesslike bandits and the bumbling police. Gilbert and Sullivan also inserted into Act II an idea they first considered for a one-act opera parody in 1876 about burglars meeting police, while their conflict escapes the notice of the oblivious father of a large family of girls. As in \"Pinafore\", \"there was a wordful self-descriptive set-piece for Stanley [\"The Major-General's Song\"], introducing himself much as Sir Joseph Porter had done ... a lugubrious comic number for the Sergeant of Police ... a song of confession for Ruth, the successor [to] Little Buttercup\", romantic material for Frederic and Mabel, and \"ensemble and chorus music in turn pretty, parodic and atmospheric.\"\n\nGilbert, Sullivan and Carte met by 24 April 1879 to make plans for a production of \"Pinafore\" and the new opera in America. Carte travelled to New York in the summer of 1879 and made arrangements with theatre manager John T. Ford to present, at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, the authorised productions. He then returned to London. Meanwhile, once \"Pinafore\" became a hit in London, the author, composer and producer had the financial resources to produce future shows themselves, and they executed a plan to free themselves from their financial backers in the \"Comedy Opera Company\". Carte formed a new partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan to divide profits equally among themselves after the expenses of each of their shows.\n\nIn November 1879, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte sailed to America with a company of strong singers, to play both \"Pinafore\" and the new opera, including J. H. Ryley as Sir Joseph, Blanche Roosevelt as Josephine, Alice Barnett as Little Buttercup, Furneaux Cook as Dick Deadeye, Hugh Talbot as Ralph Rackstraw and Jessie Bond as Cousin Hebe, some of whom had been in the \"Pinafore\" cast in London. To these, he added some American singers, including Signor Brocolini as Captain Corcoran. Alfred Cellier came to assist Sullivan, while his brother François remained in London to conduct \"Pinafore\" there. Gilbert and Sullivan chose talented actors who were not well-known stars, and so they did not command high fees. They then tailored their operas to the particular abilities of these performers. The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience: as critic Herman Klein wrote, \"we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [the Gilbertian quips and absurdities] were said and done. For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings ... [They] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight.\" Gilbert acted as stage director for his own plays and operas. He sought naturalism in acting, which was unusual at the time, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes. Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals.\nThe composition of the music for \"Pirates\" was unusual, in that Sullivan wrote the music for the acts in reverse, intending to bring the completed Act II with him to New York, with Act I existing only in sketches. When he arrived in New York, however, he found that he had left the sketches behind, and he had to reconstruct the first act from memory. Gilbert told a correspondent many years later that Sullivan was unable to recall his setting of the entrance of the women's chorus, so they substituted the chorus \"Climbing over rocky mountain\" from their earlier opera, \"Thespis\". Sullivan's manuscript for \"Pirates\" contains pages removed from a \"Thespis\" score, with the vocal parts of this chorus altered from their original arrangement as a four-part chorus. Some scholars (e.g. Tillett and Spencer, 2000) have suggested that Gilbert and Sullivan had planned all along to re-use \"Climbing over rocky mountain,\" and perhaps other parts of \"Thespis\". They argue that Sullivan's having the unpublished \"Thespis\" score in New York, when there were no plans to revive \"Thespis\", might not have been accidental. In any case, on 10 December 1879, Sullivan wrote a letter to his mother about the new opera, upon which he was hard at work in New York. \"I think it will be a great success, for it is exquisitely funny, and the music is strikingly tuneful and catching.\" As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the overture for the last moment, sketching it out and entrusting its composition to the company's music director, in this case Alfred Cellier.\n\n\"Pinafore\" opened in New York on 1 December 1879 and ran for the rest of December. After a reasonably strong first week, audiences quickly fell off, since most New Yorkers had already seen local productions of \"Pinafore\". This was unexpected and forced Gilbert and Sullivan to race to complete and rehearse their new opera, \"The Pirates of Penzance\". The work's title is a multi-layered joke. On the one hand, Penzance was a docile seaside resort in 1879, and not the place where one would expect to encounter pirates. On the other hand, the title was also a jab at the theatrical \"pirates\" who had staged unlicensed productions of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" in America. To secure the British copyright, a D'Oyly Carte touring company gave a perfunctory copyright performance of \"Pirates\" the afternoon before the New York premiere, at the Royal Bijou Theatre in Paignton, Devon, organised by Helen Lenoir, who would later marry Richard D'Oyly Carte. The cast, which was performing \"Pinafore\" in the evenings in Torquay, received some of the music for \"Pirates\" only two days beforehand. Having had only one rehearsal, they travelled to nearby Paignton for the matinee, where they read their parts from scripts carried onto the stage, making do with whatever costumes they had on hand.\n\n\"Pirates\" opened on 31 December 1879 in New York and was an immediate hit. On 2 January 1880, Sullivan wrote, in another letter to his mother from New York, \"The libretto is ingenious, clever, wonderfully funny in parts, and sometimes brilliant in dialogue – beautifully written for music, as is all Gilbert does. ... The music is infinitely superior in every way to the \"Pinafore\" – 'tunier' and more developed, of a higher class altogether. I think that in time it will be very popular.\" Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing \"Pirates\" and \"Pinafore\". Sullivan's prediction was correct. After a strong run in New York and several American tours, \"Pirates\" opened in London on 3 April 1880, running for 363 performances there. It remains one of the most popular G&S works. The London sets were designed by John O'Connor.\n\nThe critics' notices were generally excellent in both New York and London. The character of Major-General Stanley was widely taken to be a caricature of the popular general Sir Garnet Wolseley. The biographer Michael Ainger, however, doubts that Gilbert intended a caricature of Wolseley, identifying instead General Henry Turner, uncle of Gilbert's wife, as the pattern for the \"modern Major-General\". Gilbert disliked Turner, who, unlike the progressive Wolseley, was of the old school of officers. Nevertheless, in the original London production, George Grossmith imitated Wolseley's mannerisms and appearance, particularly his large moustache, and the audience recognised the allusion. Wolseley himself, according to his biographer, took no offence at the caricature and sometimes sang \"I am the very model of a modern Major-General\" for the private amusement of his family and friends.\n\n\nOn the coast of Cornwall, during Queen Victoria's reign, Frederic celebrates the completion of his twenty-first year and the end of his apprenticeship to a gentlemanly band of pirates (\"Pour, oh pour the pirate sherry\"). The pirates' maid of all work, Ruth, appears and reveals that, as Frederic's nursemaid long ago, she made a mistake \"through being hard of hearing\": Mishearing Frederic's father's instructions, she apprenticed him to a pirate, instead of to a ship's \"pilot\" (\"When Frederic was a little lad\").\n\nFrederic has never seen any woman other than Ruth, and he believes her to be beautiful. The pirates know better and suggest that Frederic take Ruth with him when he returns to civilisation. Frederic announces that, although it pains him, so strong is his sense of duty that, once free from his apprenticeship, he will be forced to devote himself to the pirates' extermination. He also points out that they are not successful pirates: since they are all orphans, they allow their prey to go free if they too are orphans. Frederic notes that word of this has got about, so captured ships' companies routinely claim to be orphans. Frederic invites the pirates to give up piracy and go with him, so that he need not destroy them, but the Pirate King says that, compared with respectability, piracy is comparatively honest (\"Oh! better far to live and die\"). The pirates depart, leaving Frederic and Ruth. Frederic sees a group of beautiful young girls approaching the pirate lair, and realises that Ruth misled him about her appearance (\"Oh false one! You have deceived me!\"). Sending Ruth away, Frederic hides before the girls arrive.\nThe girls burst exuberantly upon the secluded spot (\"Climbing over rocky mountain\"). Frederic reveals himself (\"Stop, ladies, pray!\"), startling them. He appeals to them to help him reform (\"Oh! is there not one maiden breast?\"). The girls are fascinated by him, but all reject him, except one: Mabel, responds to his plea, chiding her sisters for their lack of charity (\"Oh sisters deaf to pity's name for shame!\"). She offers Frederic her pity (\"Poor wand'ring one\"), and the two quickly fall in love. The other girls discuss whether to eavesdrop or to leave the new couple alone (\"What ought we to do?\"), deciding to \"talk about the weather,\" although they steal glances at the affectionate couple (\"How beautifully blue the sky\").\n\nFrederic warns the young ladies that his old associates will soon return (\"Stay, we must not lose our senses\"), but before they can flee, the pirates arrive and capture the girls, intending to marry them (\"Here's a first rate opportunity\"). Mabel warns the pirates that the girls' father is a Major-General (\"Hold, monsters!\"), who soon arrives and introduces himself (\"I am the very model of a modern Major-General\"). He appeals to the pirates not to take his daughters, leaving him to face his old age alone. Having heard of the famous Pirates of Penzance, he pretends that he is an orphan to elicit their sympathy (\"Oh, men of dark and dismal fate\"). The soft-hearted pirates release the girls (\"Hail, Poetry!\"), making Major-General Stanley and his daughters honorary members of their band (\"Pray observe the magnanimity\").\n\nThe Major-General sits in a ruined chapel on his estate, surrounded by his daughters. His conscience is tortured by the lie that he told the pirates, and the girls attempt to console him (\"Oh dry the glist'ning tear\"). The Sergeant of Police and his corps arrive to announce their readiness to arrest the pirates (\"When the foeman bares his steel\"). The girls loudly express their admiration of the police for facing likely slaughter at the hands of fierce and merciless foes. The police are unnerved by this but finally leave.\nLeft alone, Frederic, who is to lead the police, reflects on his opportunity to atone for a life of piracy (\"Now for the pirate's lair\"), at which point he encounters Ruth and the Pirate King. They have realised that Frederic's apprenticeship was worded so as to bind him to them until his twenty-first \"birthday\" – and, because that birthday happens to be on the 29th of February (in a leap year), it means that technically only five birthdays have passed (\"When you had left our pirate fold\"), and he will not reach his twenty-first birthday until he is in his eighties. Frederic is convinced by this logic and agrees to rejoin the pirates. He then sees it as his duty to inform the Pirate King of the Major-General's deception. The outraged outlaw declares that the pirates' \"revenge will be swift and terrible\" (\"Away, away, my heart's on fire\").\n\nFrederic meets Mabel (\"All is prepared\"), and she pleads with him to stay (\"Stay Frederic, stay\"), but he feels bound by his duty to the pirates until his 21st birthday – in 1940. They agree to be faithful to each other until then, though to Mabel \"It seems so long\" (\"Oh here is love and here is truth\"); Frederic departs. Mabel steels herself (\"No, I'll be brave\") and tells the police that they must go alone to face the pirates. They muse that an outlaw might be just like any other man, and it is a shame to deprive him of \"that liberty which is so dear to all\" (\"When a felon's not engaged in his employment\"). The police hide on hearing the approach of the pirates (\"A rollicking band of pirates we\"), who have stolen onto the estate, intending to avenge themselves for the Major-General's lie (\"With cat-like tread\").\n\nJust then, Major-General Stanley appears, sleepless with guilt, and the pirates also hide (\"Hush, hush! not a word\"), while the Major-General listens to the soothing breeze (\"Sighing softly to the river\"). The girls come looking for him (\"Now what is this and what is that\"). The pirates leap to the attack, and the police rush to the defence; but the police are easily defeated, and the Pirate King urges the captured Major-General to prepare for death. The Sergeant has one stratagem left: he demands that the pirates yield \"in Queen Victoria's name\"; the pirates, overcome with loyalty to their Queen, do so. Ruth appears and reveals that the pirates are \"all noblemen who have gone wrong\". The Major-General is impressed by this and all is forgiven. Frederic and Mabel are reunited, and the Major-General is happy to marry his daughters to the noble pirates after all.\n\n\nAct I\n\n\nAct II\n\nThe notices from critics were generally excellent in both New York and London in 1880. In New York, the \"Herald\" and the \"Tribune\" both dedicated considerable space to their reviews. The \"Herald\" took the view that \"the new work is in every respect superior to the \"Pinafore\", the text more humorous, the music more elegant and more elaborate.\" The \"Tribune\" called it \"a brilliant and complete success\", commenting, \"The humor of the \"Pirates\" is richer, but more recondite. It demands a closer attention to the words [but] there are great stores of wit and drollery ... which will well repay exploration. ... The music is fresh, bright, elegant and merry, and much of it belongs to a higher order of art than the most popular of the tunes of \"Pinafore\".\" \"The New York Times\" also praised the work, writing, \"it would be impossible for a confirmed misanthrope to refrain from merriment over it\", though the paper doubted if \"Pirates\" could repeat the prodigious success of \"Pinafore\".\n\nAfter the London premiere, the critical consensus, led by the theatrical newspaper \"The Era\", was that the new work marked a distinct advance on Gilbert and Sullivan's earlier works. \"The Pall Mall Gazette\" said, \"Of Mr. Sullivan's music we must speak in detail on some other occasion. Suffice it for the present to say that in the new style which he has marked out for himself it is the best he has written.\" \"The Graphic\" wrote:\nThere were a few dissenting comments: \"The Manchester Guardian\" thought both author and composer had drawn on the works of their predecessors: \"Mr. Gilbert ... seems to have borrowed an idea from Sheridan's \"The Critic\"; Mr. Sullivan's music is sprightly, tuneful and full of 'go', although it is certainly lacking in originality.\" \"The Sporting Times\" noted, \"It doesn't appear to have struck any of the critics yet that the central idea in \"The Pirates of Penzance\" is taken from \"Our Island Home\", which was played by the German Reeds some ten years ago.\" \"The Times\" thought Gilbert's wit outran his dramatic invention, and Sullivan's music for the new work was not quite as good as his score for \"The Sorcerer\", which the \"Times\" critic called a masterpiece.\n\nThe overture to \"The Pirates of Penzance\" was composed by Sullivan and his musical assistant Alfred Cellier. It follows the pattern of most Savoy opera overtures: a lively opening (the melody of \"With cat-like tread\"), a slow middle section (\"Ah, leave me not to pine alone\"), and a concluding allegro in a compressed sonata form, in which the themes of \"How beautifully blue the sky\" and \"A paradox, a paradox\" are combined.\n\nThe score parodies several composers, most conspicuously Verdi. \"Come, friends, who plough the sea\" and \"You triumph now\" are burlesques of \"Il trovatore\", and one of the best-known choral passages from the finale to Act I, \"Hail Poetry\", is, according to the Sullivan scholar, Arthur Jacobs, a burlesque of the prayer scene, \"La Vergine degli Angeli\", in Verdi's \"La forza del destino\". However, another musicologist, Nicholas Temperley, writes, \"The choral outburst 'Hail, Poetry' in \"The Pirates of Penzance\" would need very little alteration to turn it into a Mozart string quartet.\" Another well-known parody number from the work is the song for coloratura, \"Poor wand'ring one\", which is generally thought to burlesque Gounod's waltz-songs, though the music critic of \"The Times\" called it \"mock-Donizetti\". In a scene in Act II, Mabel addresses the police, who chant their response in the manner of an Anglican church service.\n\nSullivan even managed to parody two composers at once. The critic Rodney Milnes describes the Major-General's Act II song, \"Sighing softly to the river\", \"as plainly inspired by – and indeed worthy of – Sullivan's hero Schubert\", and Amanda Holden speaks of the song's \"Schubertian water-rippling accompaniment\", but adds that it simultaneously spoofs Verdi's \"Il trovatore\", with the soloist unaware of a concealed male chorus singing behind him.\n\nWriting about patter songs, Shaw, in his capacity as a music critic, praised \"the time-honored lilt which Sir Arthur Sullivan, following the example of Mozart and Rossini, chose for the lists of accomplishments of the Major-General in The Pirates or the Colonel in Patience.\"\n\nThis opera contains two well-known examples of Sullivan's characteristic combination of two seemingly disparate melodies. Jacobs suggests that Berlioz's \"La damnation de Faust\", a great favourite in Sullivan's formative years, may have been the model for Sullivan's trademark contrapuntal mingling of the rapid prattle of the women's chorus in Act I (\"How beautifully blue the sky\") in 2/4 time with the lovers' duet in waltz time. Jacobs writes that \"the whole number [shifts] with Schubertian ease from B to G and back again.\" In Act II, a double chorus combines the policemen's dogged tune, \"When the foeman bares his steel\" and the soaring line for the women, \"Go, ye heroes, go to glory\". In adapting the four-part chorus \"Climbing over rocky mountain\" from \"Thespis\" for re-use in \"Pirates\", Sullivan took less trouble: he wrote only a single vocal line, suitable for soprano voices. Despite this, the number ends with another example of Sullivan's counterpoint, with the chorus singing the second melody of the piece (\"Let us gaily tread the measure\") while the orchestra plays the first (\"Climbing over rocky mountain\").\n\nSullivan set a particular vocal challenge for the soprano who portrays Mabel. The Sullivan scholar Gervase Hughes wrote, \"Mabel ... \"must\" be a coloratura because of 'Poor wand'ring one!', yet 'Dear father, why leave your bed' demands steady beauty of tone throughout the octave F to F, and 'Ah, leave me not to pine' goes a third lower still.\" In \"The Music of Arthur Sullivan\" (1959), Hughes quoted four extracts from \"Pirates\", saying that if hearing each out of context one might attribute it to Schubert, Mendelssohn, Gounod or Bizet respectively, \"yet on learning the truth one would kick oneself for not having recognised Sullivan's touch in all four.\" Hughes concluded by quoting the introductory bars of \"When a felon's not engaged in his employment\", adding, \"There could never be any doubt as to who wrote \"that\", and it is as English as our wonderful police themselves.\"\n\nBecause the work was premiered in three different places (the Paignton performance and the full productions in New York and London), there are more variations in the early libretto and score of \"The Pirates of Penzance\" than in other Gilbert and Sullivan works. Songs sent from New York to the D'Oyly Carte touring company in England for the Paignton premiere were then altered or omitted during Broadway rehearsals. Gilbert and Sullivan trimmed the work for the London premiere, and Gilbert made further alterations up to and including the 1908 Savoy revival. For example, early versions depicted the Pirate King as the servant of the pirate band, and the words of the opening chorus were, \"Pour, O King, the pirate sherry\". In the original New York production the revelation by Ruth that the pirates are \"all noblemen who have gone wrong\" prompted the following exchange (recalling a famous passage in \"H.M.S. Pinafore\"):\n\nIn the original London production, this exchange was shortened to the following:\nGilbert deleted the exchange in the 1900 revival, and the Chappell vocal score was revised accordingly. For the 1908 revival Gilbert had the pirates yielding \"in good King Edward's name\". Despite Helen Carte's repeated urging, Gilbert did not prepare an authorised version of the libretti of the Savoy operas.\n\nIn its 1989 production, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company restored one of the original versions of the finale, which finishes with a variation of \"I am the very model of a modern major-general\", rather than with the customary reprise of \"Poor wand'ring one\", but in later revivals, it reverted to the more familiar text.\n\n\"The Pirates of Penzance\" has been one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular comic operas. After its unique triple opening in 1879–80, it was revived in London at the Savoy Theatre in 1888 and in 1900, and for the Savoy's repertory season of 1908–09. In the British provinces, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company toured it almost continuously from 1880–1884, and again in 1888. It re-entered the D'Oyly Carte touring repertory in 1893 and was never again absent until the company's closure in 1982. New costumes were designed by Percy Anderson in 1919 and George Sheringham in 1929 (who also executed a new Act I set). Peter Goffin created a new touring set in 1957.\n\nIn America, after the New York opening on New Year's Eve, 1879, Richard D'Oyly Carte launched four companies that covered the United States on tours that lasted through the following summer. Gilbert and Sullivan themselves trained each of the touring companies through January and early February 1880, and each company's first performance – whether it was in Philadelphia, Newark, or Buffalo – was conducted by the composer. In Australia, its first authorised performance was on 19 March 1881 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, produced by J. C. Williamson. There was still no international copyright law in 1880, and the first \"unauthorised\" New York production was given by the Boston Ideal Opera Company at Booth's Theatre in September of that year. The opera premiered in a German translation by Richard Genée and Camillo Walzel (\"Die Piraten\") in Austria at the Theater an der Wien on 1 March 1889, and in Düsseldorf, Germany, on 1 December 1936.\n\nThe first non-D'Oyly Carte professional production in a country that had been subject to Gilbert's copyright (other than Williamsons' authorised productions) was in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, in September 1961. In 1979, the Torbay branch of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society presented a centenary tribute to the world premiere performance of \"Pirates\" in Paignton, with a production at the Palace Avenue Theatre (situated a few metres from the former Bijou Theatre).\n\nNew York has seen over forty major revivals since the premiere. One of these, produced and directed by Winthrop Ames in 1926 at the Plymouth Theatre, ran for 128 performances and gained good notices. A brief 1952 Broadway staging starring Martyn Green, earned Lehman Engel a Tony Award as conductor. Repertory companies that have mounted \"Pirates\" numerous times Off-Broadway and on tour in the US have included the American Savoyards (1953–67), the Light Opera of Manhattan (1968–89) and the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players (1976–present).\n\nAs discussed below, Joseph Papp's 1980–83 \"Pirates\" ran for nearly two years each on Broadway and in the West End, boosting the opera's popularity. Professional and amateur productions of the opera continue with frequency. For example, the Chicago Lyric Opera and English National Opera each staged the work in 2004, and in 2007, the New York City Opera and Opera Australia both mounted new productions. In 2013, Scottish Opera produced a British touring production of \"The Pirates of Penzance\" co-produced by the trustees of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Richard Suart played Major-General Stanley and Nicholas Sharratt played Frederic.\n\nThe following table shows the history of the D'Oyly Carte productions in Gilbert's lifetime (excluding tours):\n\nThe following tables show the casts of the principal original productions and D'Oyly Carte Opera Company touring repertory at various times through to the company's 1982 closure:\n\nIn 1980, Joseph Papp and the Public Theater of New York City produced a new version of \"Pirates\", directed by Wilford Leach and choreographed by Graciela Daniele, at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park, one of the series of annual Shakespeare in the Park summer events. Musical direction and arrangements were by William Elliott. The show played for 10 previews and 35 performances. It then transferred to Broadway, opening on 8 January 1981 for a run of 20 previews and 787 regular performances at the Uris and Minskoff Theatres. This take on \"Pirates\" earned enthusiastic reviews and seven Tony Award nominations, winning three, including the award for Best Revival and for Leach as director. It was also nominated for eight Drama Desk Awards, winning five, including Outstanding Musical and director.\n\nCompared with traditional productions of the opera, Papp's \"Pirates\" featured a more swashbuckling Pirate King and Frederic, and a broader, more musical comedy style of singing and humour. It did not significantly change the libretto, but it used a new orchestration and arrangements that changed some keys, added repeats, lengthened dance music and made other minor changes in the score. The \"Matter Patter\" trio from \"Ruddigore\" and \"Sorry her lot\" from \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", two other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, were interpolated into the show. The production also restored Gilbert and Sullivan's original New York ending, with a reprise of the Major-General's song in the Act II finale. Linda Ronstadt starred as Mabel, Rex Smith as Frederic, Kevin Kline as the Pirate King, Patricia Routledge as Ruth (replaced by Estelle Parsons for the Broadway transfer), George Rose as the Major-General, and Tony Azito as the Sergeant of Police. Kline won a Tony Award for his performance. Smith won a Theatre World Award, and Kline and Azito won Drama Desk Awards. Notable replacements during the Broadway run included Karla DeVito, Maureen McGovern and Pam Dawber as Mabel; Robby Benson, Patrick Cassidy and Peter Noone as Frederic; Treat Williams, Gary Sandy, James Belushi and Wally Kurth as the Pirate King; David Garrison as the Sergeant; George S. Irving as the Major-General; and Kaye Ballard as Ruth. The Los Angeles cast of the production featured Barry Bostwick as the Pirate King, Jo Anne Worley as Ruth, Clive Revill as the Major-General, Dawber as Mabel, Paxton Whitehead as the Sergeant, Caroline Peyton as Edith and Andy Gibb as Frederic.\nThe production opened at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, on 26 May 1982, to generally warm reviews, for a run of 601 performances. Notable among the cast were George Cole and Ronald Fraser as the Major-General; Pamela Stephenson as Mabel; Michael Praed and Peter Noone as Frederic; Tim Curry, Timothy Bentinck, Oliver Tobias and Paul Nicholas as the Pirate King; Chris Langham as the Sergeant of Police; Annie Ross as Ruth; Bonnie Langford as Kate; and Louise Gold as Isabel.\nThe Australian production opened in Melbourne in January 1984, opening the new Victorian Arts Centre, directed by John Feraro. It starred Jon English as the Pirate King, Simon Gallaher as Frederic, June Bronhill as Ruth, David Atkins as the Sergeant of Police and Marina Prior as Mabel. The six-week limited season was followed by an Australian national tour from 1984 to 1986 and another come-back tour with same cast in the mid-1990s. In 1985, \"Pirates\" opened the new Queensland Performing Arts Centre in Brisbane, setting attendance records that were not surpassed until many years later by \"The Phantom of the Opera\". The Papp version also inspired foreign-language productions in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.\n\nThe Papp production was turned into a film in 1983, with the original Broadway principal cast reprising their roles, except that Angela Lansbury replaced Estelle Parsons as Ruth. The minor roles used British actors miming to their Broadway counterparts. The film has been shown occasionally on television. Another film based loosely on the opera and inspired by the success of the Papp version, \"The Pirate Movie\", was released during the Broadway run.\n\nThe Papp production design has been widely imitated in other modern productions of \"Pirates\", even where traditional orchestration and the standard score are used. The designs and musical arrangements created for the Papp production are protected by copyright; an unlicensed 1982 production mounted in Dublin in advance of Papp's own London production was enjoined from transferring to London by a successful lawsuit. Some modern productions are also influenced by the Disney film franchise \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", combining aspects of the Papp production with the Disney design concepts. Not all of these revivals have generated the same enthusiasm as Papp's 1980s productions. A 1999 UK touring production received this critique: \"No doubt when Papp first staged this show in New York and London it had some quality of cheek or chutzpah or pizzazz or irony or something that accounted for its success. But all that's left now ... is a crass Broadway-style musical arrangement ground out by a seven-piece band, and the worst kind of smutty send-up of a historic piece of art.\"\n\n\"The Pirates of Penzance\" has been recorded many times, and the critical consensus is that it has fared well on record. The first complete recording of the score was in 1921, under the direction of Rupert D'Oyly Carte, but with established recording singers rather than D'Oyly Carte Opera Company performers. In 1929, \"The Gramophone\" said of a new set with a mainly D'Oyly Carte cast, \"This new recording represents the high-water mark so far as Gilbert and Sullivan opera is concerned. In each of the previous Savoy albums there have been occasional lapses which prevented one from awarding them unqualified praise; but with the \"Pirates\" it is happily otherwise; from first to last, and in every bar, a simply delightful production.\" Of later recordings by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, the 1968 recording (with complete dialogue) is highly regarded: The online \"Gilbert and Sullivan Discography\" says, \"This recording is one of the best D'Oyly Carte sets of all time, and certainly the best \"Pirates\"\", and the \"Penguin Guide to Opera on Compact Disc\" also recommends it. So too does the \"Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music\", alongside the 1993 Mackerras recording. The opera critic Alan Blyth recommended the D'Oyly Carte recording of 1990: \"a performance full of the kind of life that can only come from the experience of stage performances\". The online \"Discography\" site also mentions the 1981 Papp recording as \"excellent\", despite its inauthentic 1980 re-orchestrations that \"changed some of the timbres so as to appeal to a rock-oriented public\".\n\nOf the available commercial videos, the \"Discography\" site considers the Brent Walker better than the Papp version. More recent professional productions have been recorded on video by the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival.\n\nSelected recordings\n\n\"Pirates\" is one of the most frequently referenced works of Gilbert and Sullivan. The Major-General's Song, in particular, is frequently parodied, pastiched and used in advertising. Parody versions have been used in political commentary as well as entertainment media. Its challenging patter has proved interesting to comedians; notable examples include Tom Lehrer's song \"The Elements\" and David Hyde Pierce's monologue, as host of \"Saturday Night Live\". In 2010, comedian Ron Butler released a YouTube pastiche of the song in character as President Obama which, as of May 2012, had garnered more than 1,750,000 total views.\n\nPastiche examples include the \"Animaniacs\" version, \"I am the very model of a cartoon individual\", in the episode \"H.M.S. Yakko\"; the \"Doctor Who\" audio \"I am the very model of a Gallifreyan buccaneer\" in \"Doctor Who and the Pirates\"; the \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\" version in the episode \"The Cold Open\" (2006), where the cast performs \"We'll be the very model of a modern network TV show\"; and the \"Mass Effect 2\" video game version, where the character Mordin Solus sings: \"I am the very model of a scientist Salarian\".\n\nThe song is often used in film and on television, unchanged in many instances, as a character's audition piece, or seen in a \"school play\" scene. Examples include a \"VeggieTales\" episode entitled \"The Wonderful World of Auto-Tainment!\"; the \"Frasier\" episode \"Fathers and Sons\"; \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Deep Space Homer\"; and the \"Mad About You\" episode \"Moody Blues\", where Paul directs a charity production of \"Penzance\" starring his father, Burt, as the Major-General. In \"The Muppet Show\" (season 3, episode 4) guest host, comedian Gilda Radner, sings the song with a talking carrot (Parodying the pilot/pirate confusion in \"Pirates\", Radner had requested a talking \"parrot\", but was misheard). In an episode of \"Home Improvement\", Al Borland begins to sing the song when tricked into thinking he is in a soundproof booth. In the \"Babylon 5\" episode \"Atonement\", Marcus Cole uses the song to drive Dr Stephen Franklin crazy on a long journey to Mars.\n\nExamples of the use of the song in advertising include Martyn Green's pastiche of the song listing all of the varieties of Campbell's Soup and a 2011 Geico commercial in which a couple that wants to save money, but still listen to musicals, finds a roommate, dressed as the Major-General, who awkwardly begins the song while dancing on a coffee table. Gimbels department store had a campaign sung to the tune of the Major-General's Song that began, \"We are the very model of a modern big department store.\" George Washington, in the number \"Right Hand Man\" from the 2015 musical \"Hamilton\" by Lin-Manuel Miranda, refers to himself with irony as \"The model of a modern major general\", which he rhymes with \"men are all\" and \"pedestal\". Miranda commented: \"I always felt like ‘mineral’ wasn’t the best possible rhyme.\"\n\nOther film references to \"Pirates\" include \"Kate & Leopold\", where there are multiple references, including a scene where Leopold sings \"I Am The Very Model of A Modern Major-General\" while accompanying himself on the piano; and in \"Pretty Woman\", Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) covers a social gaffe by prostitute Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts), who comments that the opera \"La traviata\" was so good that she almost \"peed [her] pants\", by saying that she had said that she liked it better than \"The Pirates of Penzance\"\". In Walt Disney's cartoon \"\" (2004), there is a performance of \"Pirates\" that becomes the setting for the climactic battle between the Musketeers and Captain Pete. \"Pirates\" songs sung in the cartoon are \"With cat-like tread\", \"Poor wand'ring one\", \"Climbing over rocky mountain\" and the Major-General's song. \"Poor wand'ring one\" was used in the movie \"An American Tail\". The soundtrack of the 1992 film \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" includes \"Poor Wand'ring One\" and \"Oh Dry the Glistening Tear\".\n\nTelevision references, in addition to those mentioned above, included the series \"The West Wing\", where \"Pirates\" and other Gilbert and Sullivan operas are mentioned in several episodes, especially by Deputy Communications Director, Sam Seaborn, who was recording secretary of his school's Gilbert and Sullivan society. In \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\", a poster from \"Pirates\" hangs on Matt Albie's office wall. Both TV series were created by Aaron Sorkin. In the pilot episode of the 2008 CBS series \"Flashpoint\", a police officer and his partner sing the policeman's song. In an \"Assy McGee\" episode entitled \"Pegfinger\", Detective Sanchez's wife is a member of a community theatre that performs the opera. In a 1986 episode of the animated television adaptation of \"The Wind in the Willows\" entitled \"A Producer's Lot\", several characters put on a production of \"Pirates\". In a 2005 \"Family Guy\" episode \"Peter's Got Woods\", Brian Griffin sings \"Sighing Softly\", with Peter Griffin's assistance. In a 2012 episode, \"Killer Queen\", Peter gives a garbled rendition of the Major-General's Song. In the 2009 \"Criminal Minds\" episode \"The Slave of Duty\", Hotch quotes \"Oh dry the glist'ning tear\". In the 1992 episode \"The Understudy\" of \"Clarissa Explains it All\", the title character is chosen to understudy Mabel in a school production of \"Pirates\" and is unprepared when she must go on; a scene from \"The Mikado\" is also heard.\n\nOther notable instances of references to \"Pirates\" include a \"New York Times\" article on 29 February 1940, memorialising that Frederic was finally out of his indentures. Six years previously, the arms granted to the municipal borough of Penzance in 1934 contain a pirate dressed in Gilbert's original costuming, and Penzance had a rugby team called the Penzance Pirates, which is now called the Cornish Pirates. In 1980, Isaac Asimov wrote a short story called \"The Year of the Action\", concerning whether the action of \"Pirates\" took place on 1 March 1873, or 1 March 1877 (depending on whether Gilbert took into account the fact that 1900 was not a leap year). The plot of Laurie R. King's 2011 novel \"Pirate King\" centers on a 1924 silent movie adaption of \"The Pirates of Penzance\".\n\nThe music from the chorus of \"With cat-like tread\", which begins \"Come, friends, who plough the sea,\" was used in the popular American song, \"Hail, Hail, the Gang's All Here.\" \"With cat-like tread\" is also part of the soundtrack, along with other Gilbert and Sullivan songs, in the 1981 film, \"Chariots of Fire\", and it was pastiched in the \"HMS Yakko\" episode of \"Animaniacs\" in a song about surfing a whale.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\nLists of productions\n"}

It lists important figures, collectives, publications, exhibitions and moments that have contributed to discussion and development of the movement. For the indigenous Māori population, the emergence of the feminist art movement broadly coincided with the emergence of Māori Renaissance.\n\n1972\n\nThe feminist publication \"Broadsheet\" is co-founded by Anne Else and Sandra Coney in Auckland. It is New Zealand's first feminist magazine, and provides regular arts coverage. It ceases publication in 1997.\n\n1974\n\nFeminist poet Heather McPherson starts The Women Artists Group in Christchurch and begins working towards establishing the women's art journal \"Spiral,\" and the Spiral Collective.\n\n1975\n\nThe Robert McDougall Art Gallery in Christchurch (now the Christchurch Art Gallery) organises \"Women's Art: An Exhibition of Six Women Artists\" to mark International Women's Year. The exhibition is curated by artist Allie Eagle, then Exhibitions Officer at the gallery.\n\nWorks from photographer Fiona Clark's series 'Dance Party', taken at a gay lib dance party at Auckland University in 1974, are withdrawn from the touring photography exhibition \"The Active Eye\" after accusations of indecency.\n\n1976\n\nThe women's art journal \"Spiral\" begins publication. The \"International Women's Film Festival\" tours Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland.\n\n1977\n\nMembers of Women's artists groups, including Heather McPherson and Allie Eagle, work together to produce the Women's Art Environment at the Canterbury Society of Arts.\n\n1978\n\nAllie Eagle show the works \"This woman died I care\" (based on a banned photograph of a woman who died after having an illegal abortion) and \"Empathy for a Rape Trial Victim\"; the exhibition stokes controversy and the artist receives hate mail.\n\n1979\n\nThe Wellington Women's Gallery opens. Founded by Marian Evans, Anna Keir and Bridie Lonie the gallery was established as a non-profit, designed to 'support and promote women artists’.\n\nThe National Art Gallery (now the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa) establishes the Women's Art Archives, designed to collect the 'existing, neglected work by women and keep track of new work'. The archive is expanded to include Australian and Pacific women artists.\n\n1980\n\nThe National Art Gallery stages the exhibition \"Women in Communication,\" curated by exhibitions officer Louise Upton.

Art historian Cheryll Sotheran writes an overview of the current state and reception of women's art in New Zealand, noting that 'most critics in New Zealand avoid or condemn exhibitions of women's art which use gender difference as a political weapon. The women whose art receives favourable reviews (or in many cases any reviews at all) are those whose work fits the modernist mould, are not feminists, are asexual and apolitical.'\n\nHaeata, the Māori women’s art collective, is established in Wellington. Members include Keri Kaa, Patricia Grace, Robyn Kahukiwa and Irihapeti Ramsden. It supports a number of significant female Māori artists and produces and tours exhibitions.\n\nBronwynne Cornish is commissioned by the Auckland Art Gallery to produce a solo work and creates a multi-part ceramic installation titled \"Dedicated to the Kindness of Mothers\". \nIn April, Gretchen Albrecht selects work for a group exhibition arranged by the Outreach Gallery in Auckland, \"New Works By Women\".\n\nIn June, Juliet Batten facilitates \"The Menstrual Maze\" at Greer's Factory in Auckland.\nThe June issue of feminist magazine \"Broadsheet\" includes a special feature on feminist artists.

It ceases publication in 1990.\n\nArt critic Lita Barrie delivers a paper, 'Remissions: toward a deconstruction of phallic unequivocality: deferrals', at the Critic's Conference at the National Art Gallery.

It is the stand-alone sequel \nto \"\", featuring characters and storylines mostly self contained from the events of its predecessor as well as an overall more lighthearted tone. Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (the executive producers of \"Prime\") did not return to the new series. In the United States, the series ran on Cartoon Network from March 14, 2015 to November 11, 2017.\n\nThe show's second season, featuring guest appearances from some returning \"Transformers: Prime\" characters, premiered on February 20, 2016. A six-episode mini-series centered on the return of Starscream premiered in Canada on September 10, 2016, before debuting on U.S television the following month. The third and final season, subtitled \"Combiner Force\", aired from April 29, 2017 to November 11, 2017.\n\nFive Years after the events of \"\", Cybertron's beginning brings forth a new age of prosperity to a new generation of Transformers. Earth no longer remembers the Decepticon-Autobot conflict as the Cybertronians stopped visiting the planet. Bumblebee has since become a seasoned Cybertronian police officer and despite his fame, he chooses to be a humble peacekeeper. Things change when he is summoned by the vision of Optimus Prime. Thought to be long dead after restoring Cybertron's population, Optimus Prime calls for Bumblebee to return to Earth as a new threat appears.\n\nWith the help of Sideswipe (a rebel \"bad boy bot\") and Strongarm (an Elite Guard cadet partnered to him), the trio makes it to Earth to discover a crashed maximum security prison ship called the \"Alchemor\" and its steward Fixit (a hyperactive Mini-Con with faulty wiring). They soon learn the \"Alchemor\" had \"a couple hundred\" Decepticon prisoners within Stasis Pods, but all of its inmates have escaped. It is now their duty to recapture all the escaped Decepticon prisoners before they cause further harm on Earth. With the aid of humans Russell and Denny Clay and the Dinobot Grimlock (who was a prisoner of Alchemor for committing property damage before siding with Bumblebee), Bumblebee leads this unlikely team to protect Earth from the Decepticon prisoners led by Steeljaw and restore order. Steeljaw even forms his own group fellow Decepticon prisoners like the metal-eating Underbite, crime boss Thunderhoof, stranded bounty hunter Fracture, Fracture's Mini-Con partners Airazor and Divebomb, and cowardly informant Clampdown.\n\nThe Autobots are later joined with the likes of Autobot bounty hunter Drift, his Mini-Con partners Slipstream and Jetstorm, the female warrior Windblade, and the return of Optimus Prime in the wake of the arrival of Megatronus, who was the one that crashed the Alchemor (and subsequently freed Steeljaw and his pack and later blackmailed Steeljaw into helping him escape his imprisonment) and who the Thirteen Primes have been preparing Optimus for. During the battle Bumblebee, Sideswipe, and Strongarm realize they can combine their Decepticon hunters together and become more powerful. After a lengthy battle, the Autobots manage to pin Megatronus under the right arm of the Crown City Colossus statue. Bumblebee, Sideswipe, and Strongarm combine the power from their Decepticon hunters and unleash a massive beam of energy that is powerful enough to blast Megatronus to dust. As Steeljaw had been blasted away by Megatronus, the Autobots were able to capture Underbite, Thunderhoof, Fracture, and Clampdown. Just as the Autobots are about to leave, Bumblebee orders his team to \"Rev up and Roll out!\", finally finding his perfect rallying cry. Back at the Scrapyard, Bumblebee asks his team if they would like to stay on Earth. One by one, each Autobot states why they would like to stay on Earth. Optimus Prime also agrees to stay on Earth, but he notes that he will only do so as Bumblebee's equal rather than as his leader to which Bumblebee agrees.\n\nWeeks after the defeat of The Fallen, the Autobots continue to deal with the threat of the Decepticon fugitives that are still on Earth. While Steeljaw is still at large, he eventually discovers another group of Decepticons stationed on the crashed remains of a second half of the \"Alchemor\" that is dubbed \"Decepticon Island\" led by Glowstrike, Scorponok, and Saberhorn. As Optimus is weakened when the immense power he was lent from the Primes is drained by them, the Autobots split into two teams: an Away Team led by Optimus Prime and another team that remains at their scrapyard base. Along the way, the Autobots run into a strange occurrence in the form of Decepticon criminals who are not listed in the \"Alchemor\" prisoner manifest yet have criminal records on Cybertron. Steeljaw even proved himself to the \"Decepticon Island\" faction by not only freeing Thunderhoof and Clampdown, but also freeing the prisoners Bisk, Groundpounder, Overload, Quillfire, and Springload to be his \"elite warriors.\"\n\nDuring this period of time, Optimus slowly recovers his strength and teaches the Away team (Drift and his Mini-Con students, Sideswipe, and Windblade) valuable lessons about teamwork. Fixit eventually repairs the GroundBridge following an explosion that occurred after he originally dispatched the Away Team, but a malfunction allowed Soundwave (who was trapped in the Shadowzone as seen in the Season 3 finale of \"\") to escape, but his stay was short-lived and attempt to contact Megatron was thwarted as Team Bee put him back in.\n\nAs the two Autobot teams are reunited, they pair up with the Autobot Ratchet and his Mini-Con Undertone and find the rest of the Decepticons in \"Decepticon Island\". The Autobots come up with a plan: infiltrate the base so they could place and activate a Stasis Bomb which would place ALL Decepticons within its range in stasis. Thanks to Sideswipe and Strongarm, who disabled the restrictor collars worn by the enslaved Caretaker Mini-Cons, Fixit leads his brethren into coming to Bumblebee and Optimus's aid in defeating Steeljaw, helping to ensure that all Autobots and Mini-Cons escape the ship and ensuring that the plan succeeds, which it does. In the wake of their victory, Optimus Prime, Ratchet, Windblade, and the Caretaker Mini-Cons repair the ship to be returned to Cybertron, as Bumblebee and the team reside on Earth.\n\nFollowing the events of the \"Decepticon Island\" battle, a group of Decepticon Scavengers arrive on Earth looking for relics from the Great War; they have been partnered with Weaponizer Mini-Cons, a breed of Mini-Cons who can control the bodies of their wielder. At the same time, Starscream makes an unexpected return following the events of \"Predacons Rising\" with the help of a trio of bounty hunters (Shadelock, RoughEdge, and Razorhorn). Starscream seeks the Dark Star Saber and the Weaponizer Mini-Cons in a plot to rebuild the Decepticon Empire and kill Megatron as revenge for all of the abuse he inflicted upon him. Upon learning the truth from the Mini-Con Sawtooth, the Weaponizers then abandon the Scavengers and later ally themselves with the Autobots. The Autobots are successful in defeating the Scavengers and the bounty hunters, and eventually Starscream as well. With the day saved, Optimus Prime loads all of the Decepticons onto his ship along with the Dark Star Saber before leaving to hand them over to the Cybertronian Authorities. The Weaponizers thank the Autobots for saving them and then they leave in their Sub-Orbital Craft (which Fixit both fixed and modified for space travel) with the intent of \"going where they will never be found\".\n\nSometime after their victory against Starscream and the Scavengers, Team Bee begins crossing paths with the Stunticons, a group of Decepticons consisting of Motormaster, Dragstrip, Slashmark, Heatseeker, and Wildbreak who can combine into Menasor. In order to combat this, the Autobots need to combine themselves into Ultra Bee.\n\nFollowing the Stunticons' defeat, Optimus Prime has them and several other Decepticons that have been captured recently stored away in his ship so he could return them to Cybertron. He also enlists Drift and his Mini-Con students to accompany him for a special mission. At the same time, Soundwave is working to escape from the Shadowzone with the help of some Activator Mini-Con allies. Also, Steeljaw, Underbite, Thunderhoof, Quillfire, and Clampdown return where they are tasked with capturing Bumblebee's team for their mysterious benefactors on Cybertron who arranged for them to be pardoned of their respective crimes. Soundwave eventually gets free from the Shadowzone and is also revealed to be allied with Steeljaw's mysterious benefactors, but he is defeated by Team Bee before he could activate a beacon that would try to summon Megatron and taken back to Cybertron by Optimus Prime to stand trial. It is soon discovered that Steeljaw and Soundwave's benefactors are the members of the Autobot High Council who are actually Decepticon infiltrators (consisting of Cyclonus, Cyberwarp, Riotgear, Skyjack, and Treadshock) who have plans to invade Earth. When Ultra Bee defeats their combined form of Galvatronus, the Autobots restore order to Cybertron as a formation of a new Autobot High Council is underway.\n\n\n\nThe series was originally planned to premiere on what was known as the Hub Network (a joint venture between Hasbro and Discovery Communications). However, on October 7, 2014, just days before the channel's re-branding as Discovery Family that took place on October 13, it was announced that the series would premiere on Cartoon Network instead. Hasbro Studios president Stephen Davis felt that Cartoon Network was a more appropriate home for a \"Transformers\" series due to its male-oriented demographics, having felt that Hub Network had been skewed towards girls. Previous animated \"Transformers\" series had also aired on Cartoon Network prior to the launch of the joint venture and Hasbro Studios.\n\nThe series debuted with a special prime time premiere of the two-part pilot on March 14, 2015, followed by the regular time slot debut, starting with an encore of \"Pilot\" Pt. 1, on March 21.\n\nSeason 2 ran from February 20 to May 14, 2016. The six-part miniseries premiered on October 22 and concluded on December 3.\n\nSeason 3 ran from April 29 to November 11, 2017. It was the third and final season.\n\nOn January 13, 2015, it was announced that Cartoon Network has acquired the rights to broadcast the series worldwide, similarly to the global distribution of before it.\nSeveral countries have premiered the series before the United States. On February 9, Canal J premiered the series in France, making it the first in the world to broadcast it on television. On March 2, Biggs premiered it in Portugal. In Italy, K2 aired the pilot on March 7, followed by the official premiere on March 9. On March 13, Cartoon Network Arabic premiered the Arabic version of the series .\nAmong English speaking countries, Cartoon Network in Australia was first to debut the series, having premiered it on February 21. On March 7, the series debuted on two versions of Cartoon Network, one available in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta, the other broadcasting in English to Greece, Greek Cyprus, the Middle East and Africa. In Canada, the show premiered on Teletoon on March 21. The series was premiered on May 23, 2015 on Cartoon Network India.The series also aired on Toonami in India in English and on Voot, a viacom18 app in Hindi dubbed version.\n\nSeason 1 made its debut on CITV weekday morning lineup on January 4, 2016. Season 2 first aired on CITV in March 2016 in the UK.\nIn Japan, where the two preceding toy lines to Transformers —Diaclone and Microman— were created, the series was premiered on March 15, 2015 on Animax under the local title of . First season had a break after episode 13 on June 14, and resumed on September 20 with episode 14. The songs \"Save the Future!!\" and \"Try (Transformers: Adventure)\" replace the original opening and closing themes, respectively. Takara Tomy, the company that has been representing \"Transformers\" franchise in Japan since its inception under the pre-merger Takara, is marketing and promoting associated toys on behalf of Hasbro.\n\nShout Factory released the first five episodes onto DVD titled \"A New Autobot Mission\" on October 27, 2015. They released the complete first season on May 10, 2016. In Australia, Beyond Home Entertainment released the complete first season onto DVD on September 1, 2015; they also released a single-disc DVD comprising the first seven episodes on the same day.\n\n"}

{"id": "253645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=253645", "title": "Varieties of Chinese", "text": "Varieties of Chinese\n\nChinese, also known as Sinitic, is a branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family consisting of hundreds of local language varieties, many of which are not mutually intelligible. The differences are similar to those within the Romance languages, with variation particularly strong in the more mountainous southeast. These varieties, often called \"dialects\", have been classified into seven to ten groups, the largest being Mandarin (e.g. Beijing dialect), Wu (e.g. Shanghainese), Min (e.g. Hokkien), and Yue (e.g. Cantonese).\n\nChinese varieties differ most in their phonology, and to a lesser extent in vocabulary and syntax. Southern varieties tend to have fewer initial consonants than northern and central varieties, but more often preserve the Middle Chinese final consonants. All have phonemic tones, with northern varieties tending to have fewer distinctions than southern ones. Many have tone sandhi, with the most complex patterns in the coastal area from Zhejiang to eastern Guangdong.\n\nStandard Chinese takes its phonology from the Beijing dialect, with vocabulary from the Mandarin group and grammar based on literature in the modern written vernacular. It is the sole official language of both China and Taiwan, one of the four official languages of Singapore, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations.\n\nAt the end of the 2nd millennium BC, a form of Chinese was spoken in a compact area around the lower Wei River and middle Yellow River.\nFrom there it expanded eastwards across the North China Plain to Shandong and then south into the valley of the Yangtze River and beyond to the hills of south China.\nAs the language spread, it replaced formerly dominant languages in those areas, and regional differences grew.\nSimultaneously, especially in periods of political unity, there was a tendency to promote a central standard to facilitate communication between people from different regions.\n\nThe first evidence of dialectal variation is found in texts from the Spring and Autumn period (722–479 BC). At that time, the Zhou royal domain, though no longer politically powerful, still defined standard speech.\nThe \"Fangyan\" (early 1st century AD) is devoted to differences in vocabulary between regions.\nCommentaries from the Eastern Han period (first two centuries AD) contain much discussion of local variations in pronunciation.\nThe \"Qieyun\" rhyme book (601 AD) noted wide variation in pronunciation between regions, and set out to define a standard pronunciation for reading the classics.\nThis standard, known as Middle Chinese, is believed to be a diasystem based on the reading traditions of northern and southern capitals.\n\nThe North China Plain provided few barriers to migration, leading to relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area in northern China. In contrast, the mountains and rivers of southern China have spawned the other six major groups of Chinese languages, with great internal diversity, particularly in Fujian.\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, most Chinese people spoke only their local language.\nAs a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as \"Guānhuà\" (官話, literally \"speech of officials\").\nKnowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.\n\nIn the early years of the Republic of China, Literary Chinese was replaced as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects.\nIn the 1930s a standard national language was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect, but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties.\nIt is the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China and of the Republic of China governing Taiwan, and one of the official languages of Singapore.\n\nStandard Mandarin Chinese now dominates public life in mainland China, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese. Outside China and Taiwan, the only varieties of Chinese commonly taught in university courses are Standard Mandarin and Cantonese.\n\nChinese has been likened to the Romance languages of Europe, the modern descendents of Latin.\nIn both cases, the ancestral language was spread by imperial expansion over substrate languages 2000 years ago, by the Qin–Han empire in China and the Roman Empire in Europe.\nIn Western Europe, Medieval Latin remained the standard for scholarly and administrative writing for centuries, and influenced local varieties, as did Literary Chinese in China.\nIn both Europe and China, local forms of speech diverged from the written standard and from each other, producing extensive dialect continua, with widely separated varieties being mutually unintelligible.\n\nOn the other hand, there are major differences.\nIn China, political unity was restored in the late 6th century (by the Sui dynasty) and has persisted (with interludes of division) until the present day.\nMeanwhile, Europe remained fragmented and developed numerous independent states.\nVernacular writing, facilitated by the alphabet, supplanted Latin, and these states developed their own standard languages.\nIn China, however, Literary Chinese maintained its monopoly on formal writing until the start of the 20th century.\nThe logographic writing, read with varying local pronunciations, continued to serve as a source of vocabulary and idioms for the local varieties.\nThe new national standard, Vernacular Chinese, the written counterpart of spoken Standard Chinese, is also used as a literary form by speakers of all varieties.\n\nDialectologist Jerry Norman estimated that there are hundreds of mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese. These varieties form a dialect continuum, in which differences in speech generally become more pronounced as distances increase, although there are also some sharp boundaries. However, the rate of change in mutual intelligibility varies immensely depending on region. For example, the varieties of Mandarin spoken in all three northeastern Chinese provinces are mutually intelligible, but in the province of Fujian, where Min varieties predominate, the speech of neighbouring counties or even villages may be mutually unintelligible.\n\nClassifications of Chinese varieties in the late 19th century and early 20th century were based on impressionistic criteria. They often followed river systems, which were historically the main routes of migration and communication in southern China. The first scientific classifications, based primarily on the evolution of Middle Chinese voiced initials, were produced by Wang Li in 1936 and Li Fang-Kuei in 1937, with minor modifications by other linguists since. The conventionally accepted set of seven dialect groups first appeared in the second edition of Yuan Jiahua's dialectology handbook (1961):\n\n\nThe \"Language Atlas of China\" (1987) follows a classification of Li Rong, distinguishing three further groups:\n\nSome varieties remain unclassified, including the Danzhou dialect of northwestern Hainan, Waxiang, spoken in a small strip of land in western Hunan, and Shaozhou Tuhua, spoken in the border regions of Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi.\nThis region is an area of great linguistic diversity but has not yet been conclusively described.\n\nMost of the vocabulary of the Bai language of Yunnan appears to be related to Chinese words, though many are clearly loans from the last few centuries. Some scholars have suggested that it represents a very early branching from Chinese, while others argue that it is a more distantly related Sino-Tibetan language overlaid with two millennia of loans.\n\nJerry Norman classified the traditional seven dialect groups into three larger groups: Northern (Mandarin), Central (Wu, Gan, and Xiang) and Southern (Hakka, Yue, and Min).\nHe argued that the Southern Group is derived from a standard used in the Yangtze valley during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), which he called Old Southern Chinese, while the Central group was transitional between the Northern and Southern groups.\nSome dialect boundaries, such as between Wu and Min, are particularly abrupt, while others, such as between Mandarin and Xiang or between Min and Hakka, are much less clearly defined.\n\nScholars account for the transitional nature of the central varieties in terms of wave models. Iwata argues that innovations have been transmitted from the north across the Huai River to the Lower Yangtze Mandarin area and from there southeast to the Wu area and westwards along the Yangtze River valley and thence to southwestern areas, leaving the hills of the southeast largely untouched.\n\nA 2007 study compared fifteen major urban dialects on the objective criteria of lexical similarity and regularity of sound correspondences, and subjective criteria of intelligibility and similarity.\nMost of these criteria show a top-level split with Northern, New Xiang, and Gan in one group and Min (samples at Fuzhou, Xiamen, Chaozhou), Hakka, and Yue in the other group.\nThe exception was phonological regularity, where the one Gan dialect (Nanchang Gan) was in the Southern group and very close to Hakka, and the deepest phonological difference was between Wenzhounese (the southernmost Wu dialect) and all other dialects.\n\nThe study did not find clear splits within the Northern and Central areas:\n\nThe two Wu dialects occupied an intermediate position, closer to the Northern/New Xiang/Gan group in lexical similarity and strongly closer in subjective intelligibility but closer to Min/Hakka/Yue in phonological regularity and subjective similarity, except that Wenzhou was farthest from all other dialects in phonological regularity. The two Wu dialects were close to each other in lexical similarity and subjective similarity but not in mutual intelligibility, where Suzhou was actually closer to Northern/Xiang/Gan than to Wenzhou.\n\nIn the Southern subgroup, Hakka and Yue grouped closely together on the three lexical and subjective measures but not in phonological regularity.\nThe Min dialects showed high divergence, with Min Fuzhou (Eastern Min) grouped only weakly with the Southern Min dialects of Xiamen and Chaozhou on the two objective criteria and was actually slightly closer to Hakka and Yue on the subjective criteria.\n\nLocal varieties from different areas of China are often mutually unintelligible, differing at least as much as different Romance languages. These varieties form the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family (with Bai sometimes being included in this grouping). Because speakers share a standard written form, and have a common cultural heritage with long periods of political unity, the varieties are popularly perceived among native speakers as variants of a single Chinese language, and this is also the official position. Conventional English-language usage in Chinese linguistics is to use \"dialect\" for the speech of a particular place (regardless of status) while regional groupings like Mandarin and Wu are called \"dialect groups\". ISO 639-3 follows the \"Ethnologue\" in assigning language codes to eight of the top-level groups listed above (all but Min and Pinghua) and five subgroups of Min. Other linguists choose to refer to the major groupings as languages.\n\nIn Chinese, the term \"fāngyán\" is used for any regional subdivision of Chinese, from the speech of a village to major branches such as Mandarin and Wu. Linguists writing in Chinese often qualify the term to distinguish different levels of classification. All these terms have customarily been translated into English as \"dialect\", a practice that has been criticized as confusing. The neologisms \"regionalect\" and \"topolect\" have been proposed as alternative renderings of \"fāngyán\".\n\nThe only varieties usually recognized as languages in their own right are Dungan and Taz. This is mostly due to political reasons as they are spoken in the former Soviet Union and are usually not written in Han characters but in Cyrillic. Various mixed languages, particularly those spoken by ethnic minorities, are also referred to as languages such as Tangwang language and E language. Some people and institutions may also allude to Taiwanese language, Cantonese language, and Hakka languages. The Taiwanese Ministry of Education uses the terms \"Minnan language\" and \"Taiwan Minnan language\".\n\nThe usual unit of analysis is the syllable, traditionally analysed as consisting of an initial consonant, a final and a tone.\nIn general, southern varieties have fewer initial consonants than northern and central varieties, but more often preserve the Middle Chinese final consonants.\nSome varieties, such as Cantonese and the Shanghai dialect, include syllabic nasals as independent syllables.\n\nIn the 42 varieties surveyed in the \"Great Dictionary of Modern Chinese Dialects\", the number of initials (including a zero initial) ranges from 15 in some southern dialects to a high of 35 in the dialect of Chongming Island, Shanghai.\n\nThe initial system of the Fuzhou dialect of northern Fujian is a minimal example.\nWith the exception of , which is often merged with the zero initial, the initials of this dialect are present in all Chinese varieties, although several varieties do not distinguish from .\nHowever, most varieties have additional initials, due to a combination of innovations and retention of distinctions from Middle Chinese:\n\nChinese finals may be analysed as an optional medial glide, a main vowel and an optional coda.\n\nConservative vowel systems, such as those of Gan dialects, have high vowels , and , which also function as medials, mid vowels and , and a low -like vowel.\nIn other dialects, including Mandarin dialects, has merged with , leaving a single mid vowel with a wide range of allophones.\nMany dialects, particularly in northern and central China, have apical or retroflex vowels, which are syllabic fricatives derived from high vowels following sibilant initials.\nIn many Wu dialects, vowels and final glides have monophthongized, producing a rich inventory of vowels in open syllables.\nReduction of medials is common in Yue dialects.\n\nThe Middle Chinese codas, consisting of glides and , nasals , and , and stops , and , are best preserved in southern dialects, particularly Yue dialects.\nIn Jin, Lower Yangtze Mandarin and Wu dialects, the stops have merged as a final glottal stop, while in most northern varieties they have disappeared.\nIn Mandarin dialects final has merged with , while some central dialects have a single nasal coda, in some cases realized as a nasalization of the vowel.\n\nAll varieties of Chinese, like neighbouring languages in the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, have phonemic tones.\nEach syllable may be pronounced with between three and seven distinct pitch contours, denoting different morphemes.\nFor example, the Beijing dialect distinguishes ' ( \"mother\"), ' ( \"hemp\"), ' ( \"horse\") and ' ( \"to scold\").\nThe number of tonal contrasts varies between dialects, with northern dialects tending to have fewer distinctions than southern ones.\nMany dialects have tone sandhi, in which the pitch contour of a syllable is affected by the tones of adjacent syllables in a compound word or phrase.\nThis process is so extensive in Shanghainese that the tone system is reduced to a pitch accent system much like modern Japanese.\n\nThe tonal categories of modern varieties can be related by considering their derivation from the four tones of Middle Chinese, though cognate tonal categories in different dialects are often realized as quite different pitch contours.\nMiddle Chinese had a three-way tonal contrast in syllables with vocalic or nasal endings.\nThe traditional names of the tonal categories are \"level\"/\"even\" ( '), \"rising\" ( ') and \"departing\"/\"going\" ( \"\").\nSyllables ending in a stop consonant , or (checked syllables) had no tonal contrasts but were traditionally treated as a fourth tone category, \"entering\" ( \"\"), corresponding to syllables ending in nasals , , or .\n\nThe tones of Middle Chinese, as well as similar systems in neighbouring languages, experienced a tone split conditioned by syllabic onsets.\nSyllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch, and by the late Tang Dynasty, each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials, known as \"upper\" (/ \"yīn\") and \"lower\" (/ \"yáng\").\nWhen voicing was lost in all dialects except the Wu and Old Xiang groups, this distinction became phonemic, yielding eight tonal categories, with a six-way contrast in unchecked syllables and a two-way contrast in checked syllables.\nCantonese maintains these tones and has developed an additional distinction in checked syllables as well as one in unchecked syllables. (The latter distinction has disappeared again in many varieties.) However, most Chinese varieties have reduced the number of tonal distinctions. For example, in Mandarin, the tones resulting from the split of Middle Chinese rising and departing tones merged, leaving four tones. Furthermore, final stop consonants disappeared in most Mandarin dialects, and such syllables were distributed amongst the four remaining tones.\n\nIn Wu, voiced obstruents were retained, and the tone split never became phonemic: the higher-pitched allophones occur with initial voiceless consonants, and the lower-pitched allophones occur with initial voiced consonants. (Traditional Chinese classification nonetheless counts these as different tones.) Most Wu dialects retain the tone categories of Middle Chinese, but in Shanghainese several of these have merged.\n\nMany Chinese varieties exhibit tone sandhi, in which the realization of a tone varies depending on the context of the syllable.\nFor example, in Standard Chinese a third tone changes to a second tone when followed by another third tone.\nParticularly complex sandhi patterns are found in Wu dialects and coastal Min dialects.\nIn Shanghainese, the tone of all syllables in a word is determined by the tone of the first, so that Shanghainese has word rather than syllable tone.\n\nMost morphemes in Chinese varieties are monosyllables descended from Old Chinese words, and have cognates in all varieties:\n\nOld Chinese had two families of negatives starting with *p- and *m-, respectively.\nNorthern and Central varieties tend to use a word from the first family, cognate with Beijing \"pu\" 不, as the ordinary negator.\nA word from the second family is used as an existential negator \"have not\", as in Beijing \"mei\" 沒 and Shanghai \"m\".\nIn Mandarin varieties this word is also used for \"not yet\", whereas in Wu and other groups a different form is typically used.\nIn Southern varieties, negators tend to come from the second family.\nThe ordinary negators in these varieties are all derived from a syllabic nasal *m̩, though it has a level tone in Hakka and Yue and a rising tone in Min.\nExistential negators derive from a proto-form *mau, though again the tonal category varies between groups.\n\nFirst- and second-person pronouns are cognate across all varieties.\nFor third-person pronouns, Jin, Mandarin, and Xiang varieties have cognate forms, but other varieties generally use forms that originally had a velar or glottal initial:\n\nSouthern varieties also include distinctive substrata of vocabulary of non-Chinese origin. Some of these words may have come from Tai–Kadai and Austroasiatic languages.\n\nThe Min languages are often regarded as furthest removed linguistically from Standard Chinese in phonology, grammar, and vocabulary. Historically, the Min languages were the first to diverge from the rest of the Chinese languages (see the discussion of historical Chinese phonology for more details). The Min languages are also the group with the greatest amount of internal diversity and are often regarded as consisting of at least five separate languages, e.g. Northern Min, Southern Min, Central Min, Eastern Min, and Puxian Min.\n\nTo illustrate, in Taiwanese (a variety of Hokkien, a Min language) to express the idea that one is feeling a little ill (\"I am not feeling well.\"), one might say (in Pe̍h-oē-jī)\n\nwhich, when translated cognate-by-cognate into Mandarin, would be spoken as an awkward or semantically unrecognizable sentence:\n\nWhereas when spoken colloquially in Mandarin, one would either say,\n\nor\n\nthe latter omitting the reflexive pronoun (zìjǐ), not usually needed in Mandarin.\n\nSome people, particularly in northern China, would say,\n\nIn southern China (not including Hong Kong and Macau), where the difference between Standard Chinese and local dialects is particularly pronounced, well-educated Chinese are generally fluent in Standard Chinese, and most people have at least a good passive knowledge of it, in addition to being native speakers of the local dialect. The choice of dialect varies based on the social situation. Standard Chinese is usually considered more formal and is required when speaking to a person who does not understand the local dialect. The local dialect (be it non-Standard Chinese or non-Mandarin altogether) is generally considered more intimate and is used among close family members and friends and in everyday conversation within the local area. Chinese speakers will frequently code switch between Standard Chinese and the local dialect. Parents will generally speak to their children in dialect, and the relationship between dialect and Mandarin appears to be mostly stable. Local languages give a sense of identity to local cultures.\n\nKnowing the local dialect is of considerable social benefit, and most Chinese who permanently move to a new area will attempt to pick up the local dialect. Learning a new dialect is usually done informally through a process of immersion and recognizing sound shifts. Generally the differences are more pronounced lexically than grammatically. Typically, a speaker of one dialect of Chinese will need about a year of immersion to understand the local dialect and about three to five years to become fluent in speaking it. Because of the variety of dialects spoken, there are usually few formal methods for learning a local dialect.\n\nDue to the variety in Chinese speech, Mandarin speakers from each area of China are very often prone to fuse or \"translate\" words from their local language into their Mandarin conversations. In addition, each area of China has its recognizable accents while speaking Mandarin. Generally, the nationalized standard form of Mandarin pronunciation is only heard on news and radio broadcasts. Even in the streets of Beijing, the flavour of Mandarin varies in pronunciation from the Mandarin heard on the media.\n\nWithin mainland China, there has been a persistent drive towards promoting the standard language (大力推广普通话; \"dàlì tuīguǎng Pǔtōnghuà\"); for instance, the education system is entirely Mandarin-medium from the second year onward. However, usage of local dialect is tolerated and socially preferred in many informal situations. In Hong Kong, colloquial Cantonese characters are never used in formal documents other than quoting witnesses' spoken statements during legal trials, and within the PRC a character set closer to Mandarin tends to be used. At the national level, differences in dialect generally do not correspond to political divisions or categories, and this has for the most part prevented dialect from becoming the basis of identity politics. Historically, many of the people who promoted Chinese nationalism were from southern China and did not natively speak the national standard language, and even leaders from northern China rarely spoke with the standard accent. For example, Mao Zedong often emphasized his Hunan origins in speaking, rendering much of what he said incomprehensible to many Chinese. One consequence of this is that China does not have a well-developed tradition of spoken political rhetoric, and most Chinese political works are intended primarily as written works rather than spoken works. Another factor that limits the political implications of dialect is that it is very common within an extended family for different people to know and use different dialects.\n\nBefore 1945, other than a small Japanese-speaking population, most of the population of Taiwan were Han Chinese, who spoke Taiwanese Hokkien or Hakka, with a minority of Taiwanese aborigines, who spoke Formosan languages. When the Kuomintang retreated to the island after losing the Chinese Civil War in 1949, they brought a substantial influx of speakers of Northern Chinese, and viewed the use of Mandarin as part of their claim to be a legitimate government of the whole of China. Education policy promoted the use of Mandarin over the local languages, and was implemented especially rigidly in elementary schools, with punishments and public humiliation for children using other languages at school. From the 1970s, the government promoted adult education in Mandarin, required Mandarin for official purposes, and encouraged its increased use in broadcasting. Over a 40-year period, these policies succeeded in spreading the use and prestige of Mandarin through society at the expense of the other languages. They also aggravated social divisions, as Mandarin speakers found it difficult to find jobs in private companies but were favoured for government positions. From the 1990s, Taiwanese native languages were offered in elementary and middle schools, first in Yilan county, then in other areas governed by elected Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) politicians, and finally throughout the island.\n\nIn 1966, the Singaporean government implemented a policy of bilingual education, where Singaporean students learn both English and their designated native language, which was Mandarin for Chinese Singaporeans. The \"Goh Report\", an evaluation of Singapore's education system by Goh Keng Swee, showed that less than 40% of the student population managed to attain minimum levels of competency in two languages. It was later determined that the learning of Mandarin among Singaporean Chinese was hindered by home use of other Chinese varieties, such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese and Hakka. Hence, the government decided to rectify problems facing implementation of the bilingual education policy, by launching a campaign to promote Mandarin as a common language among the Chinese population, and to discourage use of other Chinese varieties.\n\nLaunched in 1979 by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the campaign aimed to simplify the language environment for Chinese Singaporeans, improve communication between them, and create a Mandarin-speaking environment conducive to the successful implementation of the bilingual education programme. The initial goal of the campaign was for all young Chinese to stop speaking dialects in five years, and to establish Mandarin as the language of choice in public places within 10 years. According to the government, for the bilingual policy to be effective, Mandarin should be spoken at home and should serve as the \"lingua franca\" among Chinese Singaporeans. They also argued that Mandarin was more economically valuable, and speaking Mandarin would help Chinese Singaporeans retain their heritage, as Mandarin contains a cultural repository of values and traditions that are identifiable to all Chinese, regardless of dialect group.\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30455953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30455953", "title": "What Is a Nation?", "text": "What Is a Nation?\n\n\"What is a Nation?\" (\"Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?\") is an 1882 lecture by French historian Ernest Renan (1823–1892), known for the statements that a nation is \"a daily referendum\", and that nations are based as much on what the people jointly forget, as what they remember. It is frequently quoted or anthologized in works of history or political science pertaining to nationalism and national identity. Renan wrote \"What is a Nation\" in order to symbolize the nationalism which was born in France as a result of the French Revolution of 1789.\n\nRenan begins his essay by noting that there is frequent confusion between the idea of nationhood and of racial or linguistic groupings, a form of confusion which he says can produce \"the gravest errors\". He promises to conduct an autopsy-like examination, \"in an absolutely cold and impartial fashion.\" \n\nHe claims that nations existing at the time of writing in 1882, such as France, Germany, England and Russia, will continue to exist for hundreds of years, and that any nation trying to dominate them will be quickly pushed back to its own borders, by a coalition of other nations; \"The establishment of a new Roman or Charlemagnian Empire has become an impossibility. \" \n\nRenan believed that nations developed from the common needs of the people, who consisted of different social groups seeking a \"collective identity\". He praises the eighteenth century for its achievements in regards to humanity and the restoration of the pure identity of man, one which was free from misconceptions and socially established variances. Renan discredits the theory that race is the basis for the unification of people. It is important to note that France was quite ethnically diverse during the French Revolution and the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte, but it nevertheless managed to set the stage for nationalism. Renan also asserts that neither language nor religion are basis for solidarity because language “invites people to unite, but does not force them to do so” and \"religion has become an individual matter\" For example, the United States and England both speak English but do not constitute a single, united nation and countries no longer operate on the notion of religions operating against each other, forcing people to choose between one or the other.\n\nRenan noted that a unique element of the European nation-forming experience was the mixture of races, origins and religions, where conquering people often adopted the religion and manners, and married the women, of the people they conquered. He notes that France was quite ethnically diverse during the French Revolution. For example, \"at the end of one or two generations, the Norman invaders were indistinguishable from the rest of the population\". Nonetheless, they had a profound influence, bringing with them \"a nobility of military habit, a patriotism\" which did not exist before. -\n\nRenan then states what has become one of the most famous and enduring ideas of the essay. \"Forgetfulness, and I would even say historical error, are essential in the creation of a nation.\" Historical research, by revealing unwanted truths, can even endanger nationhood. All nations, even the most benevolent in later practice, are founded on acts of violence, which are then forgotten. \"Unity is always achieved by brutality: the joining of the north of France with the center was the result of nearly a century of extermination and terror\". He believes that people unite in their memories of suffering because alleviating grief requires a “common effort” which serves as a foundation for unity. Members of a community feel as though they have accomplished something great when they are able to survive in adverse conditions. He gives some examples of countries like Turkey and Bohemia where there is rigid stratification, or where different communities are played off against one another, and where the homogenization of different groups could not take place, resulting in a failure of nationhood. This leads to one of the most frequently quoted statements in the essay:\n\nYet the essence of a nation is that all individuals have many things in common, and also that they have forgotten many things. No French citizen knows whether he is a Burgundian, an Alan, a Taifale, or a Visigoth, yet every French citizen has to have forgotten the massacre of Saint Bartholomew, or the massacre that took place in the South in the thirteenth century.\n\nWhile many nations, such as France, begin with a feudal regime such as a monarchy, others, such as the United States and Switzerland, are formed by acts of consensual aggregation. France and many others, however, survived their feudal roots while maintaining their identity. Renan inquires what is the organizing principle? It can't be race, because France is \"Celt, Iberian, German...The most noble countries, England, France and Italy, are the ones where the blood is most mixed.\" \nLanguage, by contrast, \"invites us but does not force us, to unite\". Countries which share the Spanish or English language don't merge with one another, while the people of Switzerland speak several languages. Modern nationhood also cannot be based on religion, which Renan observes, is currently practiced according to individual belief. \"You can be French, English, German, yet Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, or practicing no religion\". Mutuality of interests is fine for corporations and their affiliates, but nationality is based on sentiment. Geography merely leads us astray, and often to violence: \"Mountains don't know how to carve out countries\".\n\nRenan concludes that a nation is\n\nThus the idea of nation is based upon common glories in the past,common will in the present to live together,having performed great deeds together and wish to perform still more for the nation,having future program to put into effect and having suffered, enjoyed and hoped together.\n\nA very important element of nationhood, says Renan, is the desire to continue forming part of the nation. Renan's second frequently quoted statement is:\n\nThe existence of a nation (you will pardon me this metaphor) is a daily referendum, just as the continuing existence of an individual is a perpetual affirmation of life.\n\nThis leads Renan to the conclusion that \"A nation never has a veritable interest in annexing or keeping another region against the wishes of its people\". In other words, areas such as states or provinces which wish to secede, should be permitted to do so. \"If doubts arise about national borders, consult the population of the area in dispute. They have the right to an opinion on the issue.\"\n\nRenan concludes that nationhood is not an eternal concept, but changes over time (like everything else in this world). \"A European confederation will probably replace the nations of today\". At the current time, however, the existence of separate nations serves to guarantee liberty, in a way which would be lost if the whole world served under one law and one master. \"Each brings one note to the great concert of humanity...\"\n\nRenan gives Switzerland as a prime example of a nation established by volition (choice, will):\nRenan's argument was summarized in the German term \"Willensnation\" (\"nation-by-volition\"), used to describe the status of Switzerland as a federal state by choice, and not along ethnic boundaries.\nThe term became popular to describe the Swiss political model after World War I and continues to be invoked.\n\nPolitical historian Karl Deutsch, in a quote sometimes mistakenly attributed to Renan, said that a nation is \"a group of people united by a mistaken view about the past and a hatred of their neighbours\".\n\nBenedict Anderson's 1983 work Imagined Communities, which states that a nation is an \"imagined political community\", argues that Renan contradicts himself when he says French people must have forgotten the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, yet does not explain what it is. In other words, Renan assumes that all his readers will remember the very massacre he says they have forgotten. Anderson also points out that the reason many French citizens of Renan's time knew anything of these massacres was because they learned of them in state-run schools. Thus, the state itself preserved the knowledge which needed to be forgotten for national identity.\n\nIn a 1995 book, \"For Love of Country: an essay on patriotism and nationalism\", Maurizio Viroli called Renan's essay \"the most influential late nineteenth-century interpretation of the meaning of nation\", because of its focus on the \"spiritual principle\" as opposed to race, religion or geography.\n\nOther authors, like Joxe Azurmendi, consider that really there is no such opposition to the reasons based on race, geography, history and so on. They argue that Renan maintains his intellectual background but subtly, i.e. the arguments he explicitly used in \"What is a Nation?\" are not consistent with his thinking. The concept of \"daily plebiscite\" would be ambiguous. They argue that the definition is an opportunist idealization and it should be interpreted within the Franco-Prussian War and in the midst of the dispute concerning the Alsace-Lorraine region.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2090795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090795", "title": "Workplace Religious Freedom Act", "text": "Workplace Religious Freedom Act\n\nThe Workplace Religious Freedom Act (WRFA) is a proposed amendment to title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which would limit employers' discretion to decline to accommodate the religious practices of their employees or prospective employees in the United States.\n\nWRFA would amend that part of title VII which is codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j). In its current form (as of 2013), 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j) forbids discrimination on the basis of religion, including \"all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.\" The 2013 version of WRFA would delete the phrase \"he is unable,\" and substitute for it: \"the employer is unable, after initiating and engaging in an affirmative and bona fide effort.\" In other words, an employer would be required to make a \"bona fide effort\" to accommodate each religious practice or observance, and would be relieved of this duty only if the employer could prove that the effort resulted in \"undue hardship.\"\n\nWRFA would also add an additional provision, to be codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)(2), further limiting employers' ability to deny accommodations with respect to \"the practice of wearing religious clothing or a religious hairstyle, or of taking time off for a religious reason.\" In such cases, the employer's proposed choice of accommodation would not be considered reasonable (or lawful) \"unless the accommodation removes the conflict between employment requirements and the religious practice of the employee.\" In order to refuse accommodation to these categories of religious practices, an employer would be required to meet a stringent definition of undue hardship by showing that \"the accommodation imposes a significant difficulty or expense on the conduct of the employer's business.\"\n\nWith these provisions, WRFA expressly attempts to supersede the Supreme Court's decision in \"Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison\", 432 U.S. 63 (1977) (see Section 2, \"Findings,\" para. 3). In that case, the Supreme Court held that an employer could deny an employee’s request for religious accommodation based on any burden greater than a \"de minimis\" burden on the employer.\n\nWRFA was first introduced in the House of Representatives in 1994 by Jerrold Nadler (D-NY). As originally introduced, the proposed 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)(2) would not have been limited to religious clothing, hairstyle and holiday observances.\n\nThe bill was introduced in the Senate in 1999, by Senator John Kerry (D-MA), and again in 2002. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) introduced the bill again in 2003. In 2005, WFRA was once again introduced in the Senate by Senators Santorum and Kerry, and in the House of Representatives by Representatives Mark Souder (R-IN), Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY), Bobby Jindal (R-LA), and Anthony Weiner (D-NY). Other supporters of the bill included Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA). The bill did not pass either house. In 2010, the Act was reintroduced in the Senate as the Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2010 (S. 4046). In 2012, the Act was again reintroduced in the Senate as the Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2013 (S. 3686). In each case, the Act's sponsor was Senator John Kerry (D-MA). In its various incarnations, the scope of WRFA was narrowed to encompass religious dress, grooming, and holidays. Although WRFA has consistently had supporters in both parties, it has yet to pass.\n\nThis legislation has garnered the diverse support of various religious groups including, the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, the Southern Baptist Convention, the National Council of Churches, the North American Council for Muslim Women, the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs ,the Council on American Islamic Relations, B'nai B'rith International, the American Jewish Committee, Agudath Israel of America, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and other groups.\n\nWhen first introduced, WRFA was opposed by the ACLU. The ACLU considered the bill \"poorly-written\" and argued that it could legalize certain acts of discrimination in the name of religion. The ACLU was also concerned that other employees might be forced to carry additional workloads to accommodate the religious practices of co-workers, and that the secular nature of the workplace would be eroded. They and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and several other business organizations opposed it as placing undue legal burdens on employers. When the scope of the provision which would create 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)(2) was narrowed, supporters of the bill claimed that the ACLU dropped its opposition, although the ACLU itself declined comment. Michael J. Eastman, executive director of labor law policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said of the revised bill, \"We are not in the habit of supporting bills that make it easier to sue our members.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32467005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32467005", "title": "Young Abraham", "text": "Young Abraham\n\nYoung Abraham is a CGI animated film portraying the early years of biblical Abraham.\n\nThe film opens with a portentous observation by King Nimrod's chief stargazer. He witnesses one star consuming four surrounding stars, after which an ethereal light emanating from the remaining star bathes one house in the city of Ur Kaśdim, the seat of Nimrod's kingdom. Inside this home, a baby has been born to Nimrod's general Terakh and his wife, Amaslei. Spurred by his stargazer's warnings of impending rebellion by this infant, Nimrod orders young Abraham put to death.\n\nTerakh deceives Nimrod and furnishes the baby of his servant girl to take Abraham's place. Amaslei flees, and for the next several years she rears Avraham in hiding. Early on, Avraham displays high intelligence and he quickly arrives at the conclusion of a \nsingular god. Emboldened by his discovery of God in a pervasively polytheistic land, he returns to Ur Kaśdim where he assumes a janitorial position at his father's idol shop. One day, Utz visits the shop to buy an idol. Abraham innocently asks Utz to explain how an inanimate idol of stone can provide for and he urges Utz to disavow idolatry. Then, after destroying all the idols in the shop, Avraham places the mallet into the hand of a stone likeliness of Nimrod, the largest idol in the shop and attempts to mollify his father Terakh, insisting that the idol of Nimrod was the perpetrator of the iconoclasm. Enraged by the carnage of his idols, Terakh permits Nimrod's men to frogmarch his son to Nimrod to be condemned for his blasphemous and treasonable actions.\n\nAbraham breaks loose of the guard's grip en route the palace, and finds himself on the run once again. After a fortuitous encounter with an angel, who saves him from certain death in the desert, Abraham is led by the angel to the yeshiva of Noah. Noah takes Abraham under his wing and eventually instructs a now-matured and grown up Abraham to return to Ur Kaśdim and smash the pyramid of Mesopotamian idolatry.\n\nThe final scene of the film is a showdown in which Abraham defiantly refuses to acknowledge Nimrod's bald self-declaration as \"God Supreme\" of the world. An infuriated Nimrod hurls Abraham into a bonfire, but he miraculously survives before the eyes of a repentant Nimrod, who now recognizes the God of Abraham and instructs his people to convert to Abraham's monotheistic beliefs.\n\nDrawing on the Bible, Midrash and numerous commentaries, Rabbis Yisroel Bernath and Zvi Hershcovich researched and wrote the first draft of the script.\n\nA production of Bible Kids Club, the film was produced for direct-to-video release by Big Bang Digital Studios. The film was directed by Todd Shaffer and produced by Oliver Cohen, Charlie Cohen, Moshe Dayan and Sidney El Hadad. The four-year-long project was produced at a budget of $1.8 million. The film was released in 2011.\n\n\"Young Abraham\" has been well received by audiences and has garnered positive reviews. In a feature article for Lubavitch News Service/Lubavitch.com, Mendy Rimler wrote, \"...the climax and message of the CGI (computer generated imagery) animated motion picture, a vivid and compelling retelling of the biblical and Midrashic story of Abraham’s discovery of God: At last, kosher entertainment with Jewish and visual depth.\"\n\nThe Dove Foundation awarded \"Young Abraham\" five doves, their highest rating.\n"}
