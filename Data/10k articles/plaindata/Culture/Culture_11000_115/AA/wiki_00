The show was hosted by Bassem Youssef on the free-to-air channel MBC MASR and reruns are aired on Deutsche Welle; it was formerly broadcast on the satellite channels CBC and OnTV Egypt. Bassem Youssef announced on 2 June 2014 that the show was cancelled.\n\nIts satirical style, willing to poke fun at powerful personages across the political spectrum, has led the press to compare it with \"The Daily Show\" hosted by Jon Stewart, which was the inspiration for the show. Bassem Youssef visited \"The Daily Show\" as a guest in June 2012 and April 2013, while Stewart, on hiatus from his own hosting duties, returned the favour on 25 October 2013. On 1 November 2013, the show was pulled from CBC over differences with the broadcaster. The suspension of the show raised questions about media freedom in Egypt following the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état. In early 2014, MBC MASR picked up the show, airing its first episode on 7 February 2014.\n\nFollowing the 18-day-protests of the Jan 25th revolution, \"The B+ Show\" was created by Tarek AlKazzaz and Bassem Youssef, as a political satire show commenting on the events and how the mainstream media presented them. Together they teamed up with Amr Ismail as Producer and Mohamed Khalifa as Director of a 5-minute episode for online viewing.\n\n\"The B+ Show\" was named after Youssef’s blood type; B+, and was shot entirely in Youssef’s laundry room with one table, one chair, one camera and a banner with amateur images of Tahrir Square.\n\nFor every five-minute episode, Youssef and his team used to watch up to ten hours of videos for research to help them write the script.\n\nUploaded for the first time in May 2011, \"The B+ Show\" gained more than five million views in the first three months alone, on its YouTube Channel.\n\nNine webisodes later, Egyptian channel ONTV offered Youssef to create a political satire TV show \"Al-Bernameg\", literally translating to \"the show\".\n\nThe show’s move to Egyptian channel ONTV made it one of the first internet to TV conversion in the Middle East.\n\nThe show premiered in Ramadan 2011, and became the platform for many writers, artists, and politicians to speak freely about the social and political scene.\n\nSeason one of \"Al-Bernameg\" aired a total of 104; 30-min episodes and was produced by Qsoft Ltd.\n\nDespite the great success of \"Al-Bernameg\" on ONTV, the team always aspired to be the first live-audience TV show of its genre in the Middle East. Having that vision in mind, Ahmed Abbas, the Chief Operations Officer of Qsoft and \"Al-Bernameg\"’s Project Director, started working on taking this idea further to create a multifaceted brand for Al-Bernameg. In the summer of 2012, the team successfully reached a deal with Capital Broadcast Network (CBC) to air the new season of the show with the new format, moving it from ONTV’s studios to the majestic building of Radio Cinema and Theatre, which is an exact replica of Radio City Music Hall in New York, accommodating 220 guests in total for every episode. \"Al-Bernameg\", which aired its premiere in November 2012, was the first to have a live audience in the Middle East and recorded one of the highest viewership ratings on both TV and Internet; with a combined viewership of around 120 million on YouTube alone.\n\nRadio Theatre, which is owned by Al-Ismailia for Real Estate Investment, underwent a massive renovation process to transform it into a live audience studio for the show while maintaining the aesthetics of the architecture and the interiors of the historical building. Under the leadership of the same Executive Producer, Amr Ismail, the team hired the production designer, Christopher George, and the lighting director, Mark Kenyon, of \"The X-Factor UK\" to design the new set of \"Al-Bernameg\".\n\nThe second season of \"Al-Bernameg\" consisted of 29 episodes. The show gained tremendous success through its humorous yet bold criticism of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, representing the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nThe show’s format evolved to include three segments, starting with Youssef's usual witty and humorous observations on current events, sketches performed by the team, and ending with guests from the entire political spectrum, music bands and artistic talents.\n\nAs \"Al-Bernameg\" continued with its growing success, Jon Stewart appeared as a guest on the show in June 2013, marking one of the all-time highlights of \"Al-Bernameg\" episodes. Other celebrity guests such as Amr Waked, in addition to a large number of Egypt’s and the region’s most popular music bands and performers, appeared on the show. \"Al-Bernameg\" also enjoyed diversity in its audience every week, including public figures such as Hamdeen Sabahi, Yosri Fouda, Elissa, Assala Nasri, Ziad Rahbani and Angham.\n\nSoon after the show started airing, complaints were filed against it and its host, with accusations of insulting Islam, President Morsi and disrupting public order and peace. However, \"Al-Bernameg\"’s team sustained its critical tone, risking the future of the show and holding on to the right of freedom of expression.\n\nSeason two of \"Al-Bernameg\" aired a total of 29 60-min episodes.\n\nIn October 2013, CBC suspended the airing of \"Al-Bernameg\" season 2, claiming that “the show has not been abiding by the editorial policy of the network.” In February 2014, Al-Bernameg returned with its third season, on MBC Masr satellite channel with a second re-run on Deutsche Welle (DW). The show achieved unprecedented viewership ratings every week.\n\nSeason three of \"Al-Bernameg\" aired 11 60-min episodes.\n\nIn March 2014 Nilesat announced that it was investigating jamming of broadcasts of \"Al-Bernameg\", credit for which had been claimed by an organisation known as the Egyptian Cyber Army.\n\nIn April 2014 MBC announced that they would suspend broadcasting of the show until the end of May “to avoid influencing Egyptian voters’ opinion and public opinion” in the run-up to the 2014 Egyptian presidential election.\n\nIn June 2014, Youssef announced the termination of \"Al-Bernameg\" where he said that the pressure on him, his family, and MBC had become too great.\n\n"}

Avestan is one of the Iranian languages and retained archaic voiced alveolar fricatives. It also has fricatives rather than the aspirated series seen in the closely related Indo-Aryan languages.\n\nAccording to Beekes, and are allophones of /θ/ and /x/ respectively.\n\nAvestan \"š\" continues Indo-Iranian \"*-rt-\". Its phonetic value and its phonological status (one or two phonemes) are somewhat unclear.\nThe conditions under which change from \"-rt-\" to \"-š-\" occurs are fundamentally ill-defined. Thuz, for example, Gathic/Younger \"ərəta\"/\"arəta\" ('establish') is a variant of \"aša\" but is consistently written with \"r t\"/. Similarly, \"arəti\" ('portion') and \"aši\" ('recompense'). But \"aməša\" ('immortal') is consistently written with \"š\", while \"marəta\" ('mortal') is consistently written with \"r t\". In some instances, a change is evident in only Younger Avestan. For example, the Gathic Avestan word for \"bridge\" is \"pərətūm\", while in Younger Avestan it is \"pəšūm\". Both are singular accusative forms, but when the word is singular nominative, the Younger Avestan variant is again (and all but once) with \"r t\".\n\nBenveniste suggested \"š\" was only a convenient way of writing /rt/ and should not be considered phonetically relevant. According to Gray, \"š\" is a misreading, representing /r r/, of uncertain phonetic value but \"probably\" representing a voiceless \"r\".\n\nMiller follows the older suggestion that Avestan \"š\" represents a phoneme of its own, for which he introduces the symbol \"/Ř/\" and identifies phonetically as (the voiceless allophone of Czech \"ř\"). He goes on to suggest that in writing, \"-rt-\" was restored when a scribe was aware of a morpheme boundary between the /r/ and /t/.\n\nThere are various conventions for transliteration of Din Dabireh. We adopt the following one here.\nVowels:\nConsonants:\n\nThe glides \"y\" and \"w\" are often transcribed as \"ii\" and \"uu\", imitating Din Dabireh orthography. The letter transcribed \"t̰\" indicates an allophone of with no audible release at the end of a word and before certain obstruents.\n\n"}
{"id": "491637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=491637", "title": "Beanie (seamed cap)", "text": "Beanie (seamed cap)\n\nIn the United States, a beanie is a head-hugging brimless cap, with or without a visor, made from triangular sections of cloth joined by a button at the crown and seamed together around the sides. It can also be made from leather or silk panels.\n\nIn other English-speaking countries and parts of the US, a \"beanie\" is a knitted cap (often woollen), known in parts of the United States as a \"stocking cap\" or \"beanie\" and in Canada as a \"tuque\".\n\nOne popular style of the beanie during the early half of the twentieth century was a kind of skullcap made of four or six felt panels sewn together to form the cap. The panels were often composed of two or more different contrasting colors to give them a novel and distinctive look. This type of beanie was also very popular with some colleges and fraternities, as they would often use school colors in the different panels making up the garment.\n\nAnother style of beanie was the whoopee cap, a formed and pressed wool felted hat, with a flipped up brim that formed a band around the bottom of the cap. The band would often have a decorative repeating zig-zag or scalloped pattern cut around the edge. It was also quite common for schoolboys to adorn their beanies with buttons and pins.\n\nThe cloth-covered button on the crown is about the size of a bean seed and may be the origin of the term \"beanie\". Some academics believe that the term is instead derived from a type of headgear worn in some medieval universities. The yellow hats (\"bejaunus\", meaning \"yellowbill\", later \"beanus\", a term used for both the hats and the new students) evolved into the college beanies of later years.\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford Dictionary\", the etymology is uncertain, but probably derives from the slang term \"bean\", meaning \"head\". In New Zealand and Australia, the term \"beanie\" is normally applied to a knit cap known as a tuque in Canada and parts of the US, but also may apply to the kind of skull cap historically worn by surf lifesavers and still worn during surf sports. The non-knitted variety is normally called a \"cap\" in other countries.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the term \"Benny Hat\" may also refer to a knitted style of headcovering. This name originally comes from the character \"Benny\", played by actor Paul Henry in the British \"Crossroads\" soap opera. The character appeared from the mid-1970s to the late-1980s and usually wore a knitted version of the hat.\n\nA larger variant of the skullcap, the beanie was working apparel associated with blue collar laborers, including welders, mechanics, and other tradesmen who needed to keep their hair back, but for whom a brim would be an unnecessary obstruction. Beanies do sometimes have a very small brim, less than an inch deep, around the brow front. The baseball cap evolved from this kind of beanie, with the addition of a visor to block the sun.\n\nBy the mid-1940s, beanies fell out of general popularity as a hat, in favor of cotton visored caps like the baseball cap. However, in the 1950s and possibly beyond, they were worn by college freshmen and various fraternity initiates as a form of mild hazing. For example, Lehigh University required freshmen to wear beanies, or \"dinks\", and other colleges including Franklin & Marshall, Gettysburg, Rutgers, Westminster College and others may have had similar practices. Benedictine College, in Atchison, Kansas, still carries this tradition for the first week of a freshman's classes, and is said to be the only college in the US to maintain this tradition. Wilson College continues this tradition today as a part of its Odd/Even class year \"rivalry\". \n\nIn the late 1940s, while still in high school, science fiction fanzine artist Ray Nelson adopted the use of the propeller beanie as emblematic shorthand for science fiction fandom. This was in self-mockery of the popular image of fans as childish and concerned with ephemera (such as science fiction). References to the distinctive headwear are now used to identify old-fashioned fans, as opposed to more modern fans of media science fiction.\n\nThe propeller beanie increased in popular use through comics and eventually made its way onto the character of Beany Boy of \"Beany and Cecil\". Today, computer savvy and other technically proficient people are sometimes pejoratively called propellerheads because of the one-time popularity of the propeller beanie.\n\nIn the 21st century, propeller beanies are rarely seen on the street, and are primarily worn for satirical or comedic purposes.\n\nIn 1996, student hackers placed a giant propeller beanie on the Great Dome at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The scaled-up propeller rotated as the wind drove it like a windmill.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "181592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181592", "title": "Competition", "text": "Competition\n\nCompetition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more entities, organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for scarce resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (an example of which is a zero-sum game).\n\nCompetition occurs naturally between living organisms which co-exist in the same environment. For example, animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other biological resources. Humans usually compete for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of wealth, power, prestige, and fame.\n\nCompetition is often considered to be the opposite of cooperation, however in the real world, mixtures of cooperation and competition are the norm. Optimal strategies to achieve goals are studied in the branch of mathematics known as game theory.\n\nCompetition is also a major tenet of market economies and business. It is often associated with business competition as most companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers. Also competition inside a company is usually stimulated with the larger purpose of meeting and reaching higher quality of services or improved products that the company may produce or develop.\n\nCompetition can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. Many evolutionary biologists view inter-species and intra-species competition as the driving force of adaptation, and ultimately of evolution. However, some biologists disagree, citing competition as a driving force only on a small scale, and citing the larger scale drivers of evolution to be abiotic factors (termed 'Room to Roam'). Richard Dawkins prefers to think of evolution in terms of competition between single genes, which have the welfare of the organism 'in mind' only insofar as that welfare furthers their own selfish drives for replication (termed the 'selfish gene').\n\nSome social Darwinists claim that competition also serves as a mechanism for determining the best-suited group; politically, economically and ecologically. Positively, competition may serve as a form of recreation or a challenge provided that it is non-hostile. On the negative side, competition can cause injury and loss to the organisms involved, and drain valuable resources and energy. In the human species competition can be expensive on many levels, not only in lives lost to war, physical injuries, and damaged psychological well beings, but also in the health effects from everyday civilian life caused by work stress, long work hours, abusive working relationships, and poor working conditions, that detract from the enjoyment of life, even as such competition results in financial gain for the owners.\n\nCompetition within, between, and among species is one of the most important forces in biology, especially in the field of ecology.\n\nCompetition between members of a species (\"intraspecific\") for resources such as food, water, territory, and sunlight may result in an increase in the frequency of a variant of the species best suited for survival and reproduction until its fixation within a population. However, competition among resources also has a strong tendency for diversification between members of the same species, resulting in coexistence of competitive and non-competitive strategies or cycles between low and high competitiveness. Third parties within a species often favour highly competitive strategies leading to species extinction when environmental conditions are harsh (evolutionary suicide).\n\nCompetition is also present between species (\"interspecific\"). When resources are limited, several species may depend on these resources. Thus, each of the species competes with the others to gain access to the resources. As a result, species less suited to compete for the resources may die out unless they adapt by character dislocation, for instance. According to evolutionary theory, this competition within and between species for resources plays a significant role in natural selection. At shorter time scales, competition is also one of the most important factors controlling diversity in ecological communities, but at larger scales expansion and contraction of ecological space is a much more larger factor than competition. This is illustrated by living plant communities where asymmetric competition and competitive dominance frequently occur. Multiple examples of symmetric and asymmetric competition also exist for animals.\n\nGame theory is \"the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers.\" Game theory is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, as well as logic, computer science, biology and poker. Originally, it mainly addressed zero-sum games, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants.\n\nGame theory is a major method used in mathematical economics and business for modeling competing behaviors of interacting agents. Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as auctions, bargaining, mergers & acquisitions pricing, fair division, duopolies, oligopolies, social network formation, agent-based computational economics, general equilibrium, mechanism design, and voting systems; and across such broad areas as experimental economics, behavioral economics, information economics, industrial organization, and political economy.\n\nThis research usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as \"solution concepts\" or \"equilibria\". A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the Nash equilibrium. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies. If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing.\n\nMerriam-Webster defines competition in business as \"the effort of two or more parties acting independently to secure the business of a third party by offering the most favorable terms\". It was described by Adam Smith in \"The Wealth of Nations\" and later economists as allocating productive resources to their most highly valued uses and encouraging efficiency. Later microeconomic theory distinguished between perfect competition and imperfect competition, concluding that no system of resource allocation is more efficient than perfect competition. Competition, according to the theory, causes commercial firms to develop new products, services and technologies, which would give consumers greater selection and better products. The greater selection typically causes lower prices for the products, compared to what the price would be if there was no competition (monopoly) or little competition (oligopoly).\n\nHowever, competition may also lead to wasted (duplicated) effort and to increased costs (and prices) in some circumstances. For example, the intense competition for the small number of top jobs in music and movie acting leads many aspiring musicians and actors to make substantial investments in training which are not recouped, because only a fraction become successful. Critics have also argued that competition can be destabilizing, particularly competition between certain financial institutions.\n\nExperts have also questioned the constructiveness of competition in profitability. It has been argued that competition-oriented objectives are counterproductive to raising revenues and profitability because they limit the options of strategies for firms as well as their ability to offer innovative responses to changes in the market. In addition, the strong desire to defeat rival firms with competitive prices has the strong possibility of causing price wars.\n\nThree levels of economic competition have been classified:\n\n\nIn addition, companies also compete for financing on the capital markets (equity or debt) in order to generate the necessary cash for their operations. An investor typically will consider alternative investment opportunities given his risk profile and not only look at companies just competing on product (direct competitors). Enlarging the investment universe to include indirect competitors leads to a broader peer universe of comparable, indirectly competing companies.\n\nCompetition does not necessarily have to be between companies. For example, business writers sometimes refer to internal competition. This is competition within companies. The idea was first introduced by Alfred Sloan at General Motors in the 1920s. Sloan deliberately created areas of overlap between divisions of the company so that each division would be competing with the other divisions. For example, the Chevrolet division would compete with the Pontiac division for some market segments. The competing brands by the same company allowed parts to be designed by one division and shared by several divisions, for example parts designed by Chevrolet would also be used by Pontiac. Also, in 1931, Procter & Gamble initiated a deliberate system of internal brand-versus-brand rivalry. The company was organized around different brands, with each brand allocated resources, including a dedicated group of employees willing to champion the brand. Each brand manager was given responsibility for the success or failure of the brand, and compensated accordingly.\n\nFinally, most businesses also encourage competition between individual employees. An example of this is a contest between sales representatives. The sales representative with the highest sales (or the best improvement in sales) over a period of time would gain benefits from the employer. This is also known as intra-brand competition.\n\nShalev and Asbjornsen also found that success (i.e. the saving resulted) of reverse auctions correlated most closely with competition. The literature widely supported the importance of competition as the primary driver of reverse auctions success. Their findings appear to support that argument, as competition correlated strongly with the reverse auction success, as well as with the number of bidders.\n\nIt should also be noted that business and economic competition in most countries is often limited or restricted. Competition often is subject to legal restrictions. For example, competition may be legally prohibited, as in the case with a government monopoly or a government-granted monopoly. Tariffs, subsidies or other protectionist measures may also be instituted by government in order to prevent or reduce competition. Depending on the respective economic policy, pure competition is to a greater or lesser extent regulated by competition policy and competition law. Another component of these activities is the discovery process, with instances of higher government regulations typically leading to less competitive businesses being launched.\n\nCompetition between countries is quite subtle to detect, but is quite evident in the world economy. Countries compete to provide the best possible business environment for multinational corporations. Such competition is evident by the policies undertaken by these countries to educate the future workforce. For example, East Asian economies such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea tend to emphasize education by allocating a large portion of the budget to this sector, and by implementing programmes such as gifted education.\n\nCompetition law, known in the United States as antitrust law, has three main functions. First, it prohibits agreements aimed to restrict free trading between business entities and their customers. For example, a cartel of sports shops who together fix football jersey prices higher than normal is illegal. Second, competition law can ban the existence or abusive behaviour of a firm dominating the market. One case in point could be a software company who through its monopoly on computer platforms makes consumers use its media player. Third, to preserve competitive markets, the law supervises the mergers and acquisitions of very large corporations. Competition authorities could for instance require that a large packaging company give plastic bottle licenses to competitors before taking over a major PET producer. In this case (as in all three), competition law aims to protect the welfare of consumers by ensuring business must compete for its share of the market economy.\n\nIn recent decades, competition law has also been sold as good medicine to provide better public services, traditionally funded by tax payers and administered by democratically accountable governments. Hence competition law is closely connected with the law on deregulation of access to markets, providing state aids and subsidies, the privatisation of state-owned assets and the use of independent sector regulators, such as the United Kingdom telecommunications watchdog Ofcom. Behind the practice lies the theory, which over the last fifty years has been dominated by neo-classical economics. Markets are seen as the most efficient method of allocating resources, although sometimes they fail, and regulation becomes necessary to protect the ideal market model. Behind the theory lies the history, reaching back further than the Roman Empire. The business practices of market traders, guilds and governments have always been subject to scrutiny and sometimes severe sanctions. Since the twentieth century, competition law has become global. The two largest, most organised and influential systems of competition regulation are United States antitrust law and European Community competition law. The respective national authorities, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States and the European Commission's Competition Directorate General (DGCOMP) have formed international support and enforcement networks. Competition law is growing in importance every day, which warrants for its careful study.\n\nCompetition is also found in trade. For nations, as well as firms it is important to understand trade dynamics in order to market their goods and services effectively in international markets. Balance of trade can be considered a crude, but widely used proxy for international competitiveness across levels: country, industry or even firm. Research data hints that exporting firms have a higher survival rate and achieve greater employment growth compared with non-exporters.\n\nUsing a simple concept to measure heights that firms can climb may help improve execution of strategies. International competitiveness can be measured on several criteria but few are as flexible and versatile to be applied across levels as Trade Competitiveness Index (TCI) \n\nCompetition is also found in politics. In democracies, an election is a competition for an elected office. In other words, two or more candidates strive and compete against one another to attain a position of power. The winner gains the seat of the elected office for a predefined period of time, towards the end of which another election is usually held to determine the next holder of the office.\n\nIn addition, there is inevitable competition inside a government. Because several offices are appointed, potential candidates compete against the others in order to gain the particular office. Departments may also compete for a limited amount of resources, such as for funding. Finally, where there are party systems, elected leaders of different parties will ultimately compete against the other parties for laws, funding and power.\n\nFinally, competition also exists between governments. Each country or nationality struggles for world dominance, power, or military strength. For example, the United States competed against the Soviet Union in the Cold War for world power, and the two also struggled over the different types of government (in these cases representative democracy and communism). The result of this type of competition often leads to worldwide tensions, and may sometimes erupt into warfare.\n\nWhile some sports and games (such as fishing or hiking) have been viewed as primarily recreational, most sports are considered competitive. The majority involve competition between two or more persons (sometimes using horses or cars). For example, in a game of basketball, two teams compete against one another to determine who can score the most points. When there is no set reward for the winning team, many players gain a sense of pride. In addition, extrinsic rewards may also be given. Athletes, besides competing against other humans, also compete against nature in sports such as whitewater kayaking or mountaineering, where the goal is to reach a destination, with only natural barriers impeding the process. A regularly scheduled (for instance annual) competition meant to determine the \"best\" competitor of that cycle is called a championship.\n\nCompetitive sports are governed by codified rules agreed upon by the participants. Violating these rules is considered to be unfair competition. Thus, sports provide artificial (not natural) competition; for example, competing for control of a ball, or defending territory on a playing field is not an innate biological factor in humans. Athletes in sports such as gymnastics and competitive diving compete against each other in order to come closest to a conceptual ideal of a perfect performance, which incorporates measurable criteria and standards which are translated into numerical ratings and scores by appointed judges.\n\nSports competition is generally broken down into three categories: individual sports, such as archery; dual sports, such as doubles tennis, and team sports competition, such as cricket or football. While most sports competitions are recreation, there exist several major and minor professional sports leagues throughout the world. The Olympic Games, held every four years, is usually regarded as the international pinnacle of sports competition.\n\nCompetition is a major factor in education. On a global scale, national education systems, intending to bring out the best in the next generation, encourage competitiveness among students through scholarships. Countries such as England and Singapore have special education programmes which cater for specialist students, prompting charges of academic elitism. Upon receipt of their academic results, students tend to compare their grades to see who is better. In severe cases, the pressure to perform in some countries is so high that it can result in stigmatization of intellectually deficient students, or even suicide as a consequence of failing the exams; Japan being a prime example (see Education in Japan). This has resulted in critical re-evaluation of examinations as a whole by educationalists . Critics of competition as a motivating factor in education systems, such as Alfie Kohn, assert that competition actually has a net negative influence on the achievement levels of students, and that it \"turns all of us into losers\" (Kohn 1986). Economist Richard Layard has commented on the harmful effects, stating \"people feel that they are under a great deal of pressure. They feel that their main objective in life is to do better than other people. That is certainly what young people are being taught in school every day. And it's not a good basis for a society.\"\n\nHowever, other studies such as the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking show that the effect of competition on students depends on each individual's level of agency. Students with a high level of agency thrive on competition, are self-motivated, and are willing to risk failure. Compared to their counterparts who are low in agency, these students are more likely to be flexible, adaptable and creative as adults.\n\nLiterary competitions, such as contests sponsored by literary journals, publishing houses and theaters, have increasingly become a means for aspiring writers to gain recognition. Awards for fiction include those sponsored by the \"Missouri Review\", \"Boston Review\", \"Indiana Review\", \"North American Review\" and \"Southwest Review\". The Albee Award, sponsored by the Yale Drama Series, is among the most prestigious playwriting awards.\n\nIn Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, competitions or lottos are the equivalent of what are commonly known as sweepstakes in the United States. The correct technical name for Australian consumer competitions is a trade promotion lottery or lottos.\n\nCompetition or trade promotion lottery entrants enter to win a prize or prizes, hence many entrants are all in competition, or competing for a limited number of prizes.\n\nA trade promotion lottery or competition is a free entry lottery run to promote goods or services supplied by a business. An example is where you purchase goods or services and then given the chance to enter into the lottery and possibly win a prize. A trade promotion lottery can be called a lotto, competition, contest, sweepstake, or giveaway.\n\nSuch competitions can be games of luck (randomly drawn) or skill (judged on an entry question or submission), or possibly a combination of both.\n\nPeople that enjoy entering competitions are known as compers. Many compers attend annual national conventions. In 2012 over 100 members of the online competitions community of lottos.com.au from around Australia met on the Gold Coast, Queensland to discuss competitions.\n\nCompetition has been studied in several fields, including psychology, sociology and anthropology. Social psychologists, for instance, study the nature of competition. They investigate the natural urge of competition and its circumstances. They also study group dynamics, to detect how competition emerges and what its effects are. Sociologists, meanwhile, study the effects of competition on society as a whole. In addition, anthropologists study the history and prehistory of competition in various cultures. They also investigate how competition manifested itself in various cultural settings in the past, and how competition has developed over time.\n\nMany philosophers and psychologists have identified a trait in most living organisms which can drive the particular organism to compete. This trait, called competitiveness, is viewed as an innate biological trait which coexists along with the urge for survival. Competitiveness, or the inclination to compete, though, has become synonymous with aggressiveness and ambition in the English language. More advanced civilizations integrate aggressiveness and competitiveness into their interactions, as a way to distribute resources and adapt. Many plants compete with neighboring ones for sunlight.\n\nHowever, Stephen Jay Gould and others have argued that as one ascends the evolutionary hierarchy, competitiveness (the survival instinct) becomes less innate, and more a learned behavior. The same could be said for co-operation: in humans, at least, both co-operation and competition are considered learned behaviors, because the human species learns to adapt to environmental pressures. Consequently, if survival requires competitive behaviors, the individual will compete, and if survival requires co-operative behaviors, the individual will co-operate. In the case of humans, therefore, aggressiveness may be an innate characteristic, but a person need not be competitive at the same time, for instance when scaling a cliff. On the other hand, humans seem also to have a nurturing instinct, to protect newborns and the weak. While that does not necessitate co-operative behavior, it does help.\n\nThe term also applies to econometrics. Here, it is a comparative measure of the ability and performance of a firm or sub-sector to sell and produce/supply goods and/or services in a given market. The two academic bodies of thought on the assessment of competitiveness are the Structure Conduct Performance Paradigm and the more contemporary New Empirical Industrial Organisation model. Predicting changes in the competitiveness of business sectors is becoming an integral and explicit step in public policymaking. Within capitalist economic systems, the drive of enterprises is to maintain and improve their own competitiveness.\n\nThe tendency toward extreme, unhealthy competition has been termed hypercompetitiveness. This concept originated in Karen Horney's theories on neurosis; specifically, the highly aggressive personality type which is characterized as \"moving against people\". In her view, some people have a need to compete and win at all costs as a means of maintaining their self-worth. These individuals are likely to turn any activity into a competition, and they will feel threatened if they find themselves losing. Researchers have found that men and women who score high on the trait of hypercompetitiveness are more narcissistic and less psychologically healthy than those who score low on the trait. Hypercompetitive individuals generally believe that \"winning isn't everything; it's the only thing\".\n\nMargaret Heffernan's study, \"A Bigger Prize\",\nexamines the perils and disadvantages of competition in (for example) biology, families, sport, education, commerce and the Soviet Union.\n\nKarl Marx insisted that \"the capitalist system fosters competition and egoism in all its members and thoroughly undermines all genuine forms of community\".\nIt promotes a \"climate of competitive egoism and individualism\", with competition for jobs and competition between employees; Marx said competition between workers exceeds that demonstrated by company owners. He also points out that competition separates individuals from one another and while concentration of workers and development of better communication alleviate this, they are not a decision.\n\nSigmund Freud explained competition as a primal dilemma in which all infants find themselves. The infant competes with other family members for the attention and affection of the parent of the opposite sex or the primary caregiving parent. During this time, a boy develops a deep fear that the father (the son's prime rival) will punish him for these feelings of desire for the mother, by castrating him. Girls develop penis envy towards all males. The girl’s envy is rooted in the biologic fact that, without a penis, she cannot sexually possess mother, as the infantile id demands, resultantly, the girl redirects her desire for sexual union upon father in competitive rivalry with her mother. This constellation of feelings is known as Oedipus Complex ( after the Greek Mythology figure who accidentally killed his father and married his mother). This is associated with the phallic stage of childhood development where intense primal emotions of competitive rivalry with (usually) the parent of the same sex are rampant and create a crisis that must be negotiated successfully for healthy psychological development to proceed. Unresolved Oedipus complex competitiveness issues can lead to lifelong neuroses manifesting in various ways related to an overdetermined relationship to competition.\n\nGandhi speaks of egoistic competition. For him, such qualities glorified and/or left unbridled, can lead to violence, conflict, discord and destructiveness. For Gandhi, competition comes from the ego, and therefore society must be based on mutual love, cooperation and sacrifice for the well-being of humanity. In the society desired by Gandhi, each individual will cooperate and serve for the welfare of others and people will share each other's joys, sorrows and achievements as a norm of a social life. For him, in a non-violent society, competition does not have a place and this should become realized with more people making the personal choice to have fewer tendencies toward egoism and selfishness.\n\n"}
{"id": "8349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8349", "title": "Denarius", "text": "Denarius\n\nThe denarius (, dēnāriī, ) was the standard Roman silver coin from its introduction in the Second Punic War c. 211 BC to the reign of Gordian III (AD 238–244), when it was gradually replaced by the Antoninianus. It continued to be minted in very small quantities, likely for ceremonial purposes, until and through the tetrarchy (293–313).\n\nThe word \"dēnārius\" is derived from the Latin \"dēnī\" \"containing ten\", as its value was originally of 10 assēs. The word for \"money\" descends from it in Italian (\"denaro\"), Slovene (\"denar\"), Portuguese (\"dinheiro\"), and Spanish (\"dinero\"). Its name also survives in the dinar currency.\n\nIts symbol is represented in Unicode as 𐆖 (U+10196), however it can also be represented as X̶ (capital letter X with combining long stroke overlay).\n\nA predecessor of the \"denarius\" was first struck in 267 BC, five years before the First Punic War, with an average weight of 6.81 grams, or of a Roman pound. Contact with the Greeks prompted a need for silver coinage in addition to the bronze currency that the Romans were using at that time. The predecessor of the \"denarius\" was a Greek-styled silver coin called the \"didrachm\" which was struck in Neapolis and other Greek cities in southern Italy. These coins were inscribed for Rome but closely resemble their Greek counterparts. They were most likely used for trade purposes and were seldom used in Rome.\n\nThe first distinctively Roman silver coin appeared around 226 BC. Classic historians sometimes called these coins \"denarii\", but they are classified by modern numismatists as \"quadrigati\", which is derived from the quadriga, or four-horse chariot, on the reverse, and which with a two-horse chariot or \"biga\" was the prototype for the most common designs used on Roman silver coins for the next 150 years.\n\nRome overhauled its coinage around 211 BC and introduced the denarius alongside a short-lived denomination called the victoriatus. This denarius contained an average 4.5 grams, or of a Roman pound, of silver. It formed the backbone of Roman currency throughout the Roman republic.\n\nThe denarius began to undergo slow debasement toward the end of the republican period. Under the rule of Augustus (31 BC-AD 14) its silver content fell to 3.9 grams (a theoretical weight of of a Roman pound). It remained at nearly this weight until the time of Nero (AD 37–68), when it was reduced to of a pound, or 3.4 grams. Debasement of the coin's silver content continued after Nero. Later Roman emperors reduced its content to 3 grams around the late 3rd century.\n\nThe value at its introduction was 10 asses, giving the denarius its name, which translates as \"containing ten\". In about 141 BC, it was re-tariffed at 16 asses, to reflect the decrease in weight of the as. The denarius continued to be the main coin of the Roman Empire until it was replaced by the antoninianus in the middle of the 3rd century. The coin was last issued, in bronze, under Aurelian between AD 270 and 275, and in the first years of the reign of Diocletian. ('Denarius', in \"A Dictionary of Ancient Roman Coins\", by John R. Melville-Jones (1990)).\n\nIt is difficult to give even rough comparative values for money from before the 20th century, as the range of products and services available for purchase was so different. Classical historians often say that in the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire (~27 BC) the daily wage for an unskilled laborer and common soldier was 1 denarius (with no tax deductions) or about US$2.80 in bread. During the republic (509–27 BC), legionary pay was 112.5 denarii per year (0.3 per day), later doubled by Julius Caesar to 225 denarii (0.6 per day), with soldiers having to pay for their own food and arms. Centurions received considerably higher pay: under Augustus, the lowest rank of centurion was paid 3,750 denarii per year, and the highest rank, 15,000 denarii.\n\nThe silver content of the denarius under the Roman Empire (after Nero) was about 50 grains, 3.24 grams, or (0.105ozt) troy ounce. On June 6, 2011, this was about US$3.62 in value if the silver were 0.999 pure.\n\nThe fineness of the silver content varied with political and economic circumstances. From a purity of greater than 90% silver in the 1st century AD, the denarius fell to under 60% purity by the year 200, and plummeted to 5% purity by the year 300. By the reign of Gallienus, the \"antoninianus\" was a copper coin with a thin silver wash.\n\nBy comparison, a laborer earning the minimum wage in the United States in January 2014 made US$58 for an 8-hour day, before taxes (based on the mode value of $7.25 per hour, which was true then in 20 states) and an employee earning the minimum wage in the United Kingdom in 2014 made £52 for an 8-hour day, before taxes.\n\nIn the final years of the 1st century BC Tincomarus, a local ruler in southern Britain, started issuing coins that appear to have been made from melted down \"denarii\". The coins of Eppillus, issued around Calleva Atrebatum around the same time, appear to have derived design elements from various \"denarii\" such as those of Augustus and M. Volteius.\n\nEven after the \"denarius\" was no longer regularly issued, it continued to be used as a unit of account, and the name was applied to later Roman coins in a way that is not understood. The Arabs who conquered large parts of the land that once belonged to the Eastern Roman Empire issued their own gold dinar. The lasting legacy of the \"denarius\" can be seen in the use of \"d\" as the abbreviation for the British penny until 1971. It also survived in France as the name of a coin, the denier. The denarius also survives in the common Arabic name for a currency unit, the \"dinar\" used from pre-Islamic times, and still used in several modern Arab nations. The major currency unit in former Principality of Serbia, Kingdom of Serbia and former Yugoslavia was \"dinar\", and it is still used in present-day Serbia. The Macedonian currency \"denar\" is also derived from the Roman denarius. The Italian word \"denaro\", the Spanish word \"dinero\", the Portuguese word \"dinheiro\", and the Slovene word \"\", all meaning money, are also derived from Latin \"denarius\".\n\n1 gold aureus = 2 gold quinarii = 25 silver denarii = 50 silver quinarii = 100 bronze sestertii = 200 bronze dupondii = 400 copper asses = 800 copper semisses = 1600 copper quadrantes\n\nIn the New Testament, the gospels refer to the denarius as a day's wage for a common laborer (Matthew 20:2, John 12:5). In the Book of Revelation, during the Third Seal: Black Horse, a choinix (or quart) of wheat and three quarts of barley were each valued at one denarius. Bible scholar Robert H. Mounce says the price of the wheat and barley as described in the vision appears to be ten to twelve times their normal cost in ancient times. Revelation describes a condition where basic goods are sold at greatly inflated prices. Thus, the black horse rider depicts times of deep scarcity or famine but not of starvation. The English word \"quart\" translates choinix. Apparently, a choinix of wheat was the daily ration of one adult. Thus, in the conditions pictured by Revelation 6 the normal income for a working-class family would buy enough food for only one person. The less costly barley would feed three people for one day's wages.\n\nThe denarius is also mentioned in the Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37) has also been commonly identified as the tribute penny held by Jesus in the Render unto Caesar passage Matthew 22:15–22 and Mark 12:13–17.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25756277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25756277", "title": "Dry rot treatment", "text": "Dry rot treatment\n\nDry rot treatment refers to techniques used to eliminate dry rot fungus and alleviate the damage done by the fungus to human-built wooden structures.\n\nDry rot (\"Serpula lacrymans\") is considered difficult to remove, requiring drastic action. Remedial timber treatment and damp proofing companies typically recommend stripping out of building fabric beyond the visible extent of the infestation and the use of fungicide. More holistic approaches attempt to eradicate dry rot by controlling the local environment to reduce timber moisture levels and increase ventilation in order to promote drying.\n\nThe first priority when treating dry rot is to find and remove the dampness within the building that caused the outbreak, and to promote drying out by taking measures, such as increasing ventilation. Treatment approaches differ after these steps are taken.\n\n\"S. lacrymans\" is a form of brown rot, a group of fungi which digest the cellulose and hemicellulose in timber. This particular species poses the greatest threat to buildings since it can spread through non-nutrient providing materials (e.g., masonry and plaster) for several meters until it finds more timber to attack.\n\nDry rot is spread by spores which are present in most buildings. The minimum moisture content of timber for spore germination is 28–30% (lower than other rots), and the relative humidity must be in excess of 95%. Spores are resistant to desiccation and may still be viable for germination when they are several years old.\n\nIf conditions are suitable, the spore will germinate producing microscopic fungal threads called hyphae.\n\nTable 1. Environmental conditions for mycelial growth following germination\n\nThe average moisture content of modern softwood timbers in dry buildings is generally in the range of 12–15%, and heating systems may reduce this to a far lower level. There is, therefore, no prospect of a dry rot infestation developing in a building that has been properly designed, constructed, and maintained.\n\nOnce the environment starts to dry out, the rot will become dormant and eventually die. The length of time that the fungus can remain dormant under dry conditions seems to depend on the temperature, with approximate times of nine years at 7.5 °C and one year at 22 °C being quoted.\n\nMost fungi will only thrive in acid conditions, but dry rot will remain active in alkaline conditions. This gives it the ability to grow through damp mortar, masonry, and plaster, infecting other areas of the building. Thick, conducting strands known as rhizomorphs, are produced to cross inert surfaces and penetrate masonry.\n\nA fruiting body (sporophore) may develop naturally or in response to unfavourable conditions of humidity, temperature or exhaustion of nutrients. Often the stress that provokes this is the exposure of the infestation. The fruiting body will produce millions of rust brown spores.\n\nOne belief held about dry rot is that, once established, it can survive by producing water by breaking down the timber if the original source of water is removed. Laboratory experiments conducted in 1932 on timber samples in unventilated glass jars showed that significant quantities of water were indeed produced. However these experiments do not replicate the \"real world\" environment of a building where processes of evaporation and capillary action in the wood will be removing moisture from the area faster than it can be produced by the fungus.\n\nAnother misconception is that dry rot can transport water from a source over considerable distances to an area of dry timber so that it can decay there. While the mycelium strands do conduct a nutrient solution around the fungus, it has been shown that any ability to transport water to \"wet up\" dry timber is very limited.\n\nDespite being a successful coloniser of buildings, for reasons that have not yet been fully explained, \"S. lacrymans\" is rarely found growing in the wild. Occasional specimens have been found in the foothills of the Indian Himalayas, Mt. Shasta in California, and woodlands in Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe first step in any course of treatment is to make the necessary repairs to the building defects (overflowing gutters, blocked airbricks, missing slates, etc.) that allowed the ingress of dampness. The treatment methods described below assume that the dry rot has been positively identified, the full extent of the rot ascertained, and that the building is now water tight.\n\nA number of methods of attacking dry rot have been developed which can be classified as follows:\n\n\nThe latter two methods are included for completeness as they are currently not widely used. The main purpose of this article is to compare the orthodox and environmental approaches.\n\nThe following description for the treatment of dry rot is typical of traditional methods:\n\n\nAs can be seen from stages 1 and 2, this involves the removal of a considerable quantity of building fabric.\n\nThe desire to kill the fungal strands within all materials adjoining the affected timber has led to the practice of \"wall irrigation\" at stage 4. This entails saturating the masonry with a water-soluble fungicide at a rate of about 10 litres/m. Walls of more than half-brick thickness need to be drilled at spacing to a depth of just over half the wall thickness. Walls of over thickness should be drilled from both sides. Fungicide is then injected into the holes, and the wall faces are sprayed.\n\nEnsuring thorough penetration of fungicide throughout the structure of a non-homogenous wall is extremely difficult. \"There is no practical way of ensuring that all dry rot strands within a wall are killed.\"\n\nA more recent variation of the practice of wall irrigation is the \"toxic box\" where the area of irrigation is reduced to forming a margin around the perimeter of the wall thereby containing the fungus within the wall. Here it can do no harm and will eventually die for lack of food.\n\nApplication of fungicides to the timber at stage 4 may be by brush, spray or injected under pressure into holes drilled into the wood. Preservatives based on organic solvents are used as these have better penetration into wood than water based solutions. Examples of suitable organic solvents include the following: (--- please provide examples to improve this page.). Alternatively pastes consisting of a fungicide in an oil/water emulsion may be applied to the timber.\n\nIn addition to more conventional fungicides, boron-based fungicide can be supplied in glass-like rods which are inserted into holes drilled into the wood. Boron is commonly available as the laundry supplement Borax, and as boric acid which is commonly available from pharmacists or in cockroach pesticides. Boron rods are soluble and should the timber become damp the rod will gradually dissolve diffusing preservative into the damp area. Their use is particularly appropriate for areas that are at risk but not yet affected. A surfactant (such as dish soap) is recommended in water-based preparations. \n\nIt has been reported that boron fungicides react with the cellular structure of the wood whereby the boron is deposited, and it is this process which can to varying extents harden the dry rot, depending on the degree of degradation of the wood. However, structural members should be remediated by sistering in new wood after the fungus issue has been dealt with. (Please confirm)\n\nBoron/glycol preservatives consist of an inorganic boron preservative dissolved in a glycol to produce a paste. These are water-soluble and will readily diffuse into damp wood, even from the surface, and therefore offer better penetration than more conventional fungicide products, where it is necessary to penetrate damp wood.\n\nGlycol solutions have an advantage in that they can be applied over paint (please confirm).\n\nGlycol and boron solutions are hydrophilic (water loving) and react with the water in wood, making it unavailable for the fungus. This is why dry rot can seem to be a little stringy; cells grown in dryer periods are smaller than the larger, 'plumper' cells that grow in spring, as can be seen in the trees rings used to tell how old the tree is. This moister spring growth contains the moisture the fungus consumes, in addition to that available from leaks, etc.\n\nWater-based fungicides, because they are water-based, can be washed-away in time if the wood they are applied to keeps getting wet. This is another reason why it is important to fix leaks and keep the wood dry and with an alkaline environment, and seal the wood and especially the end grain to prevent ongoing exposure to hungry spores.\n\nFungicides to defeat brown rot include: baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, tea tree oil, boron solutions, ethylene glycol or propylene glycol, vinegar, etc. Since the dry rot fungus requires an acidic environment from pH --- to --- (please provide info), certain of these fungicides work because they change the pH.\n\nRecipes for homemade fungicide solutions and wood hardeners and penetrating epoxies have been reported on the web, in addition to commercially available products. (It would be appreciated if you could improve his page by providing information about tests showing the efficacy of different treatments.)\n\nThe environmental approach can be defined as \"the exploitation of the environmental sensitivity of the dry rot fungus for its treatment\".\n\nA step-by-step procedure for using the environmental approach would be:\n\nAn example of the situation to which Stage 3 refers would be where a solid stone wall has become soaked due to a gutter becoming blocked and rainwater allowed to overflow down the wall for a period of time. Roof timbers may rest on top of the wall. Even when the ingress of water has been stopped and good ventilation established, it will take a considerable length of time for the wall to dry out. During this time, it is probable that there will be sufficient moisture present to allow fungal growth to continue. In this situation it will be necessary to isolate the timber from the masonry with DPC material. Where the ends of timbers were originally built into a wall and have rotted, these may be cut off flush with the wall and reattached using joist hangers.\n\nAlternatively, the use of pastes and boron rods would be justified in this instance. \"Preservative treatments may be essential in some situations if the spread of the fungus is to be restricted and critical timbers are to be protected while the structure dries.\" \n\nThe environmental approach emphasises the need for continued monitoring to ensure that future building defects do not start a new outbreak of dry rot or reactivate a dormant one. While in a simple small building this may be accomplished by regular maintenance inspections, systems are available that can monitor a large building with readings from moisture sensors being remotely monitored by a computer.\n\nOther treatments have been tried that attempt to exploit the dry rot’s sensitivity to heat. The use of a blowlamp to kill dry rot by applying heat to the surface of affected areas was popular at one time. Obviously, this led to the risk of fire. Experiments showed that a surface temperature of about would have to be maintained for up to five hours in order to produce a temperature that would be lethal to fungus within a thick wall.\n\nIn Denmark, a procedure has been developed whereby the building, or the affected part thereof, is tented and heated by hot air to kill dry rot. A temperature of is achieved at the centre of masonry and timbers and maintained for twenty-four hours. However, the question could be asked as to why someone should expend large amounts of energy heating the entire building to a high temperature when all that is needed to kill the rot is to dry it out.\n\nA treatment system using microwaves has also been tried. Further research will be needed before its effectiveness can be assessed.\n\nA further possible way of combating dry rot is by the use of antagonistic organisms that reduce the ability of the decay fungus to colonise or degrade the wood. The principle here is that when in a building the fungus is not in its natural environment and therefore natural competitors are unlikely to be present. It may, however, be possible to introduce these competitors into the building environment to control the dry rot.\n\n\"Trichoderma\" fungi remove some structural carbohydrates from the wood necessary for the colonisation and initiation of decay by wood-destroying fungi, and laboratory tests have shown the ability of \"Trichoderma\" fungi to kill \"S. lacrymans\". Field trials have also been carried out investigating the ability of \"Trichoderma\" fungi to prevent rot in electrical distribution poles, with mixed results.\n\nThis sort of biocontrol shows promise in the laboratory but is disappointing in the field, and more work will need to be done. As yet, biological control methods have not become established.\n\nThere are also issues with the allergenic potential of \"Trichoderma\" that may limit its use in situations where human contact is likely.\n\nProponents of the environmental approach argue that the drastic action of the orthodox approach is in line with the popular misconception that dry rot is extremely difficult to eradicate. Conversely, they would claim that it is not unusually resilient and is in fact very environmentally sensitive. Indeed, this environmental sensitivity may account for why it is so unsuccessful in the wild and may be used against it when encountered in buildings.\n\nPerhaps the most criticised aspect of the orthodox approach is the practice of wall irrigation. As stated above, this entails introducing large quantities of water-based fungicide into the building fabric. But this is at a time when the primary concern should be to dry the building out.\n\nExcessive water content in the wall will also cause a high risk of the efflorescence of salts out of the wall as it dries thereby damaging plaster and other finishes. Any such salts deposited on the wall surface may contain the fungicide used in the treatment, thereby creating a potential health hazard.\n\nThe ability of irrigation to kill all the fungus within the wall is also questionable, as thorough penetration of the fungicide throughout a non-homogeneous wall is unlikely, resulting in patchy treatment. Case studies have been cited where dry rot has emerged from walls that had previously been \"sterilised\" by irrigation—in one case, from a wall that had been treated twice before.\n\nIt is questionable whether it is necessary to take steps to kill the fungus within the wall at all as the fungal strands are not causing damage to the masonry itself. Instead, they are merely passing through the wall in search of more timber to attack. The \"toxic box\" technique, as described above, confines the irrigation to the perimeter of the wall. Even the toxic box method has been found to be of limited use. The doubts about complete penetration of any masonry remain, so it is questionable whether a complete barrier of treated material can be formed around the edge of the wall.\n\nThe orthodox approach requires that all timbers left in place are protected by the application of a preservative fungicide. As with masonry, it is not easy to achieve full penetration of the timber. The penetration of surface sprays and conventional pastes is severely compromised by high moisture levels in wood. Injection techniques do force fluid within the timber, but distribution throughout the entire piece of wood can be patchy. The use of boron/glycol preservatives do show improved penetration.\n\nAnother criticism of the orthodox approach is the sheer amount of building fabric that is removed and the consequent amount of remedial work and disruption to the use of the building. Wall irrigation requires the drilling of a large number of holes into masonry.\n\nOne argument put forward by the supporters of the environmental approach concerns the potential effect on human health of the large quantities of toxic chemicals used in orthodox treatments. Typical quotations are: \"chemical control methods cause extensive environmental degradation, pose potential hazards to wildlife and are of grave concern to public health bodies\" and \"…..many cases of illness including headaches, respiratory problems and chest pains, to name a few, have been linked to the use of such agents within buildings. Furthermore, clinical evaluation has tended to validate these concerns\". \n\nHowever, others argue that none of the products employed over the last twenty to thirty years have been proven to be harmful to people when used properly. Furthermore, there is a major difference between the use of wood preservatives and pesticides in other situations, especially agriculture, as wood preservatives are put on and into the timber and are designed to stay there for 50 or more years. Pesticides in agriculture, on the other hand, are released into an open environment.\n\nGenerally, the toxicity of the fungicides used by the industry has been reduced since 1991 with chemicals such as dieldrin, pentachlorophenol, and tributyltin oxide being replaced by organo-boron esters, permethrin, and boron/glycol mixes. One way of comparing the toxicity of chemicals is by , which gives the dose relative to bodyweight sufficient to kill 50% of the test population (usually rats).\n\nTable 2. Relative toxicities of chemicals\n\nBoron-based compounds are toxic to fungi, but their effects on mammals are minimal. However, conventional wood preservatives consist of the active ingredient and a solvent, and it is the organic solvents that seem to give more cause for concern. No ill effects appear to be produced by limited exposure to hydrocarbon solvent vapour, but a higher degree of exposure may cause symptoms such as headaches and nausea, which disappear as soon as exposure ceases.\n\nSome evidence has been produced recently that workers exposed to high levels of solvents over a number of years may develop damage to the central nervous system, but the studies have not been conclusive. This suggests that sufficient ventilation in the treated area until the product is dry is all that is required to prevent any discomfort from the solvent.\n\nDr. David Watt, in an article published in the \"Journal of Nutritional and Environmental Medicine\", is more cautious:\n\nChemical treatments used for the control or eradication of fungal infections and/or insect infestations in buildings and the residues of such treatments do not pose a proven hazard to the general population. There is, however, an apparent potential risk from such treatments and from the presence of treatment residues in treated buildings for persons who suffer from chemical sensitivity… it is concluded that further investigation and evaluation is required of alternative chemical and non chemical treatments of fungal infections and/or insect infestations in buildings.\n\nIt should be noted that Watt treats the fungicide as a whole in his article: i.e., he does not separate out the effects of the active ingredients and the solvent.\n\nIt has been stated that none of the treatment products used over the last twenty to thirty years have been proven to have caused any damage to the environment when properly used except in the isolated case of bats. However, in the UK at least, this is a major consideration, as bats are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which states that harming them or disturbing their roosts is a criminal offence.\n\nLocal damage to the environment will result when pesticides are discharged to the ground or rivers due to accident or dumping. Obviously, there is always the possibility that any chemical will not be used correctly, either through ignorance or malice, and the proponents of the environmental approach would argue that there is no need to use large quantities of chemicals anyway when there is a risk, however small.\n\nExperience from companies involved in environmental control and research findings confirm that in most situations dry rot can be fully controlled simply by altering the environment in which it is growing. The Dry Rot Research Group at the University of Abertay have conducted laboratory trials of the environmental control of dry rot on full size models of a floor/wall junction, a window, and a roof/wall junction. The full results are published in a research report by Historic Scotland and conclusively show how the growth of dry rot can be controlled simply by varying the available moisture in the environment.\n\nA case study of successful environmental control of dry rot in a large building is included as an appendix in Historic Scotland’s \"Technical Advice Note 24\". Case studies are also quoted in Dr. Brian Ridout’s book \"Timber Decay in Buildings, The Conservation Approach to Treatment\".\n\nWith all treatment methods, the costs of the repairs to rectify the building defects that permitted the ingress of moisture will be the same. The overall cost of using the environmental approach to the treatment of dry rot is likely to be less than the orthodox approach.\n\nDr. Ridout quotes a case study where an initial quote for orthodox treatment of a building was £23,000 but subsequent treatment by environmental methods resulted in a saving of one third in remedial works and timber replacement. Where it is decided to install moisture monitoring equipment, this will represent an additional capital outlay.\n\nThere is a perception amongst the general public that dry rot is difficult to eradicate. It has \"instilled fear and dread for centuries\". It is, therefore, not surprising that if a property owner is told that they have such a serious problem, they will expect that drastic action will be required to fix it.\n\nIt could be argued that, if a reputable and specialist contractor is employed to administer the orthodox treatment, this has the advantage of coming with the reassurance of a guarantee. Guarantees against the recurrence of dry rot started to be issued in the 1950s, covering treated timbers for a period of 20 years. This period was soon extended to 30 years.\n\nHowever, the usefulness of the guarantees has been questioned over the inclusion of clauses that exclude liability if the timber is allowed to get wet again during the guarantee period.\n\nAn example of the courts enforcing a guarantee is the case of ;;Ackerman v Protim Services;; (1988). In this case, dry rot recurred in a bressummer some eight years after it had been treated for a previous outbreak. The 20-year guarantee issued by the treatment company had a clause that excluded liability if recurrence was due to \"a failure to keep the property in a dry and weatherproof condition and in a good and proper state of maintenance”.\n\nThe UK Court of Appeal held that the guarantee was not invalidated by this clause because the wall into which the timber was built was damp due to the nature of the construction of the building, not through any lapse in maintenance by the owners. But the clear implication of this is that if the timber had become wet because the property owners had not maintained the building properly, then the guarantee would have become void. In other words, the client is protected against the recurrence of dry rot provided that the conditions that allow dry rot to occur do not recur.\n\nGraham Coleman, a leading specialist in damp treatment and timber decay, makes the same point on his website:\n\nBut then dry wood doesn't rot - so what is actually being 'guaranteed? Certainly not any chemical treatment that has been applied since it is clearly implied that if treated timber becomes damp it will rot. So what was the value of the preservative treatment? Obviously none!\n\nGuarantees are therefore of questionable value and may be difficult to enforce. However, the point will still be raised that if the fungicide treatment is really effective, it should not matter whether or not the treated timber gets wet again. If, on the other hand, a fungicide-treated piece of timber must be kept dry to stop it rotting, it cannot be much more resistant to rot than wood that has not been treated.\n\nIn fact, guarantees for chemical dry rot treatments may be harmful as they may lure the building owners into a false sense of security by allowing them to feel that they can afford to be less diligent with property maintenance.\n\nRichard Oxley of Oxley Conservation states that many remedial timber treatment companies simply do not know enough about the construction of historic buildings to be in a position to advise on appropriate repairs and treatments. He has experience of irreparable damage being done through such lack of knowledge (Oxley, 1995) as does Dr Ridout.\n\nThe methods and approaches used to assess and repair timbers in historic buildings have changed considerably in recent years, with a move away from wall irrigation, damage to decorative features during invasive survey work, and unnecessary cutting out or chemical treatment of timbers.\n\nWith its emphasis on reducing the amount of building fabric to be removed, the environmental approach obviously has attractions for heritage organisations whose primary purpose is to preserve buildings. Many of these organisations support the environmental approach, for example Dr. Brian Ridout’s book \"Timber Decay in Buildings, The Conservation Approach to Treatment\" being jointly published by English Heritage and Historic Scotland. Historic Scotland’s \"Technical Advice Note 24\" advocates the use of environmental treatment of dry rot, as does advice on the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Building's website.\n\nDamp (structural)\n"}

For example, if a man has a 40-inch chest measurement, a jacket with a 40-inch chest would be very tight and would constrict movement. An ease of 3 or 4 inches might be added to the pattern (making a 43-44 inch chest), or more to enhance comfort or style. Ease is not generally included in sizing measurements. To use the example again, a man with a 40-inch chest will likely buy a jacket advertised as size 40, but the actual measurements of the garment will almost always be somewhat larger.\n\nEase is most important for woven garments cut on the straight or crossgrain, allowing little or no stretch.\n\nA sloper pattern or block pattern is a simple pattern with very little or no ease made for the purpose of fitting the body accurately, from which more finished or stylized patterns may be developed.\n\nSeveral techniques can be used to add ease to a pattern. The simplest may be to add width to the pattern pieces, such as at the side seams. Pleats or gathers may also be used. Reducing the intake of darts will also add ease.\n\nContouring is the process of fitting a pattern to the body more nearly than the sloper, but it is not the same as removing ease. Contouring removes extra space \"within\" the measurements of the wearer. For example, a dress sloper will span the bust points, but a more fitted or 'contoured' bodice may dip toward the breastbone in between the breasts and fit each breast more closely, possibly even supporting each with boning. Contouring techniques can also be applied to other concave parts of the body which may be spanned by the sloper, such as the underside of the buttocks, or the knee area for pants.\n\n"}

{"id": "50101999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50101999", "title": "Genus (linguistics)", "text": "Genus (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, a genus is a group of phylogenetically related languages inside a linguistic family, in particular a genus is a group languages which can be recognized as related languages without using complex methods of historical linguistics. The notion of genus was proposed by M. Dryer, and is used commonly in some academic projects such as: WALS. According to WALS most families can be subdivided into a certain number of genera, so the notion is similar to the term subfamily.\n\nSince the 18th century, linguists have classified languages according to phylogenetic criteria. Before the 18th century, the common origins of Germanic languages or Slavic languages had been recognized. Many authors hypothesized that each of these language groups derived from a common \"mother language\" (in a similar way in which Romance languages derive historically from Latin). The philologists of the 19th century called a group of related languages a \"family of sister languages\" (generalizing the genealogical metaphor). When a \"mother language\" is undocumented, but can be partially reconstructed from its \"daughter languages\", one refers to this language as a proto-language.\n\nWith the development of comparative linguistics and the establishment of historical linguistics as a scientific discipline, more \"language families\" were recognized, and more proto-languages were proposed.\n\nThere are some problems when one tries to compare language families. Some families are huge, and their proto-languages were spoken several millennia ago, but other families are tiny and their ancestor languages seem to have been spoken more recently. Indeed, the establishment of an accepted language family depends on the quality of the documentation and the amount of comparative work done in each group of languages. Obviously, the languages of Europe were well known in the 19th century, and the Indo-European language family was well-established early on. As to the remainder of the world languages, in the 19th century only a few language families were identified, often in an incomplete manner (the Bantu and Malayo-Polynesian languages were recognized as groups of related languages, but not the Niger–Congo or Austronesian languages).\n\nOn the other hand, all the genera are internally much more homogeneous than language families. In addition, most language genera seem to involve more or less the same time depth. For these reason, genera are much more suitable for typological comparison than language families.\n\n"}
{"id": "338847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338847", "title": "Goddess of Democracy", "text": "Goddess of Democracy\n\nThe Goddess of Democracy, also known as the Goddess of Democracy and Freedom, the Spirit of Democracy, and the Goddess of Liberty (自由女神; \"zìyóu nǚshén\"), was a 10-metre-tall (33 ft) statue created during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The statue was constructed in only four days out of foam and papier-mâché over a metal armature. The constructors decided to make the statue as large as possible to try to dissuade the government from dismantling it: the government would either have to destroy the statue—an action which would potentially fuel further criticism of its policies—or leave it standing. Nevertheless, the statue was destroyed on June 4, 1989, by soldiers clearing the protesters from Tiananmen square. Since its destruction, numerous replicas and memorials have been erected around the world, including in Hong Kong and Washington, D.C.\n\nNear the end of May 1989 the Democracy Movement in Tiananmen Square, though still attracting huge throngs of participants, was losing momentum in the face of government inaction on reforms. One historian said the movement \"appeared to have sunk to its nadir. The number of students in the Square continued to decline. Those remaining seemed to have no clear leadership: Chai Ling, tired and disheartened by the difficulties of keeping the Movement together, had resigned from her post...[the Square] had degenerated into a shantytown, strewn with litter and permeated by the stench of garbage and overflowing portable toilets... Tianamen, once a magnet pulling in huge throngs, had become only an unkempt campground of little interest to citizens, many of whom considered the struggle for democracy lost.\" It was at this point that the reveal of the statue of the Goddess of Democracy reinvigorated the movement in the Square.\n\nThe statue was built by students of the Central Academy of Fine Arts beginning on May 27 at their University. It was built in hopes of bolstering the movement which \"seemed to be losing some of its momentum; the students suspected that the government was waiting for them to tire and leave the Square\". Working with a sense of urgency and expedience, to create the model the larger statue would be based on the students reworked an academic exercise built to demonstrate the effect of the distribution of weight on a piece: \"a half-meter high clay sculpture of a man grasping a pole with two raised hands and leaning his weight on it.\" \"The students cut off the lower part of the pole and added a flame at the top to turn it into a torch; they leaned the sculpture into a more upright position; they changed the man's face to a woman's, and otherwise added feminine characteristics to make the him into a her.\" They then transferred the measurements of the model, adjusting them for the larger proportion, to the foam that once carved became the monument. Jeff Widener, known for his iconic Tank Man photograph, took other photographs of the fateful rally, including two widely publicized images of the \"Goddess\"; one under construction, and another in context of the demonstration.\n\nWhile many people have noted its resemblance to the Statue of Liberty, a sculptor present during its construction, Tsao Tsing-yuan, has written that the students decided \"not\" to model their statue on the Statue of Liberty because they were concerned that it would be unoriginal and \"too openly pro-American.\" Tsao further notes the influence on the statue of the work of Russian sculptor Vera Mukhina, associated with the school of revolutionary realism. Her piece \"Worker and Kolkhoz Woman\" was especially influential for their statue's head and facial features.\nWhen the time came to transport the pieces of the statue to the Square, the State Security Bureau, hearing of the students' intention, declared that any truck drivers assisting them would lose their licenses. The students hired six Beijing carts (similar to a bicycle rickshaw except with a flat cart instead of a passenger area). Four carried the statue segments, and two carried the tools required to install it. The students had leaked a false itinerary of the move to throw off the authorities and moved the statue's three segments from the Central Academy of Fine Arts to the Square by another route. Students of the other academies assisting in the construction linked arms around the carts for protection in case the authorities arrived. At dusk on May 29, with fewer than 10,000 protesters remaining in the square the Art Students constructed bamboo scaffolding and then began assembling the statue. Troops called in to disrupt the movement and construction of the statue were \"stalled \"en route\" by Beijing residents.\" By the early morning of May 30, the statue was fully assembled in Tiananmen Square. It broke up the north-south axis of the Square, standing between the Monument to the People's Heroes, and the Tiananmen Gate (which it faced looking at its large photograph of Mao Zedong). Whether the students had intended it or not \"dozens of television cameras expertly framed the ironic, silent confrontation between Goddess and Chairman.\" When the time came for the actual unveiling, On May 30, 1989, two Beijing residents, a woman and a man, were chosen at random from the crowd and invited into the circle to pull the strings that would remove the pieces of red and blue cloth. The crowd burst into cheers and shouted slogans such as \"Long live democracy!\"\n\nWith the construction of the statue \"The students, their flagging spirits revived, announced their determination to continue occupying the Square.\" While there had been just 10,000 people in the square on the 29th, with its unveiling \"As many as 300,000 spectators flocked to the square on 30–31.\" As one historian relates, \"...a crudely sculpted thirty-three-foot high statue would bestow the struggle for democracy with a memorable symbol. ...it attracted thousands of spectators to the Square and angered the authorities, who condemned it as an \"illegal, permanent\" structure that would have to be torn down.\"\n\nThe art students who created the statue wrote a declaration that said in part:\n\nThe document was signed by the eight art academies that sponsored the creation of the statue: The Central Academies of Fine Arts, Arts and Crafts, Drama, and Music; the Beijing Film Academy; the Beijing Dance Academy; the Academy of Chinese Local Stage Arts; and the Academy of Traditional Music.\n\nThe entire statement was written \"in rather crude calligraphy\" on a long banner placed near the statue, and was read in its entirety by a female student \"with a good Mandarin accent\" from the Broadcasting Academy.\n\nOn June 3 even as the government troops positioned themselves to move on the students, applause erupted from the people gathered around the statue as it was announced there that a Democracy University would now begin classes in the Square with Zhang Boli appointed as its President. Even as classes began by the statue, to the west of the square and at Muxidi thousands of students moved to block the oncoming 27th Army who were armed with tanks, assault weapons, and bayonets. Blood was spilled by 10:30 p.m.\n\nThe soldiers were able to fulfill their timeline of reaching the Square on June 4, 1989 by 1 a.m. through the use of tanks and armored personnel carriers. The \"Goddess of Democracy\" had stood for only five days before being destroyed by soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the assault on Tiananmen that would end the Democracy Movement. The toppling of the \"Goddess of Democracy\" was seen by millions across the world on television: “pushed by a tank, it fell forward and to the right, so that its hands and the torch struck the ground first, breaking off.\" As the statue fell, protestors shouted \"Down with Fascism!\" and \"Bandits! Bandits!\" It was \"quickly and easily reduced to rubble, mixing with all the other rubble in the Square. To be cleared away by the Army\". By 5:40 a.m. a negotiated settlement allowed the remaining students to leave by the south-eastern corner of the square. The army had fulfilled its order to clear the Square by 6:00 a.m. Clashes continued throughout the city and in other towns across China.\n\nThe original statue has become an icon of liberty and a symbol of the free speech and democracy movements. The Chinese government has tried to distance itself from any discussions about the original statue or about the Tiananmen Square protests, and in the case of the Victims of Communism Memorial it called the building of a replica an \"attempt to defame China.\"\n\nSeveral replicas of the statue have been erected worldwide to commemorate the events of 1989:\n\nTsao Tsing-yuan, an advisor to the students who built the original, writes \"I myself envision a day when another replica, as large as the original and more permanent, stands in Tiananmen Square, with the names of those who died there written in gold on its base. It may well stand there after the Chairman Mao's Mausoleum has, in its turn, been pulled down.\"\n\n\n"}

Mia's dad Denny is a teacher and as a result of the snow day does not have to go to work. Mia's mom Kat, a travel agent, decides to call in sick and along with her family get on the road to visit Mia's grandparents who live on a farm. It is also revealed that Mia is dating an older, popular up-and-coming rockstar named Adam Wilde.\n\nThe story flashes back to Mia's early life with a rocker dad and an inexperienced mom, when one day they take Mia to a music class where Mia decides that she wants to start playing the cello. After her parents see that Mia is passionate about the cello, they hire a teacher to help her play. Kat is shown pregnant with Teddy, whom Mia thinks is the reason for her father's departure from his band.\n\nYears later, an adolescent Mia is still passionate about the cello and is playing at school in the band room where Adam peeks in on her playing, seeing her for the first time, leading him to ask Kim, Mia's best friend, about her.

Mia appears to have an out-of-body experience where she finds herself barefoot and sees her body lying on the road while paramedics are trying to help her and her family. Mia tries to ask a paramedic what is happening, but realizes that no one can see or hear her. Mia, now in the hospital, panics as she does not know the current status of any of her family members when they take her in for surgery.

Grandpa talks to Mia, revealing that her father gave up being in a band because he wanted to give her a better life and be a better father. He also, tearfully, gives Mia permission to move on from this life if she wants, which influences Mia to decide that she wants to die so that she can join her family on the other side.\n\nThe story flashes back to Mia at her audition for Juilliard, where she plays the best she has ever played, leading her to think that if accepted, she would go. After a reconciliation with Adam, they talk about the huge possibility of her going to Juilliard, which ultimately leads to them breaking up and going their separate ways.\n\nAfter some time, Mia seems stable enough to receive more visitors. Mia is shown symbolically about to let go when she hears the music performed at the cello recital that she attended with Adam. It is revealed that Adam has come to see Mia and that he is playing his iPod for her. He brings with him a letter Mia has received from Juilliard saying that she has been accepted and lets her know that he would do whatever she wants if she stays. He begins to play the song he has finally written about her. Mia, after flashing back through all the happy moments in her life, squeezes Adam's hand and opens her eyes and sees Adam as he hovers over her and says, \"Mia?\".\n\n\nIn December 2010, it was announced that a film based on the novel \"If I Stay\" was in the works at Summit Entertainment and that Dakota Fanning, Chloë Grace Moretz and Emily Browning were in talks to play Mia. Catherine Hardwicke was attached to direct, but was replaced by Brazilian filmmaker Heitor Dhalia, who also left the film later. On January 24, 2013, Moretz was officially cast to play the lead and R. J. Cutler was announced as the new director of the film. Trevor Smith was brought on as associate producer. The shooting of the film began on October 30 in Vancouver.\n\nIn January 2014, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Bros. were announced to be distributing the film and the release was set for August 22.\n\nThe music was composed by Heitor Pereira. The soundtrack was released on August 19, 2014 by WaterTower Music. It peaked at number 54 on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the United States, and number 77 in Australia.\n\nVancouver-based alternative rock band Hawking appeared in the film numerous times as Willamette Stone.\n\nAll the songs for Adam Wilde's band Willamette Stone, including the cover of The Smashing Pumpkins' song \"Today\", were produced by indie rock producer Adam Lasus.\n\nAs of November 20, 2014, \"If I Stay\" has grossed a worldwide total of $78,396,071 against a budget of $11 million.\n\n\"If I Stay\" opened at #3 to 2,907 locations in North America behind \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", which were in their fourth and third weeks respectively. On its opening day the film earned $6,827,007 earning it the top spot for the day.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 35%, based on 122 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Although Chloë Grace Moretz gives it her all and the story adds an intriguing supernatural twist to its melodramatic young adult fiction framework, \"If I Stay\" is ultimately more manipulative than moving\". On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 46 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nIn his review for \"The New York Times\", A.O. Scott praised Moretz's acting. He added that the \"music is both the best and the corniest part of \"If I Stay\", which makes excellent use of the classical cello repertoire.\"\n\nWriting for \"Variety\", Justin Chang criticized Moretz's acting, explaining that \"she comes off as a bit too self-assured to play the nerdy misfit.\"\n\nAnthony Lane of \"The New Yorker\" wrote a critical review of the movie, saying, \"The saddest thing about 'If I Stay' is that it affords Moretz so little opportunity to be non-sad.\" In the \"Los Angeles Times\", Olivier Gettell summed up that critics saw the film was \"clunky and uninspired.\"\n\n\"If I Stay\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 18, 2014 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment and it was also available on Netflix to stream until September 30, 2015.\n\n"}

Most of the inhabitants of this region are Druze, and there are also small Muslim and Christian communities. Safaitic inscriptions were first found in this area. The State of Jabal Druze was an autonomous area in the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon from 1921 to 1936. In the past, the name Jabal al-Druze was used for a different area, located in Mount Lebanon.\n\nThe Jabal al-Druze volcanic field, the southernmost in Syria, lies in the Haurun-Druze Plateau in SW Syria near the border with Jordan. The most prominent feature of this volcanic field is 1800m-high Jabal al-Druze (also known variously as Jabal ad Duruz, Djebel Al-Arab, Jabal Druze, Djebel ed Drouz). The alkaline volcanic field consists of a group of 118 basaltic volcanoes active from the lower-Pleistocene to the Holocene (2.6 million years ago to present). The large SW Plateau depression is filled by basaltic lava flows from volcanoes aligned in a NW-SE direction. This volcanic field lies within the northern part of the massive alkaline Harrat al-Shamah (also known as Harrat al-Shaam) volcanic field that extends from southern Syria to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\nIn Arabic, the word \"tell\" means \"mound\" or \"hill\", but in Jabal al-Druze it rather refers to a volcanic cone.\n\n"}

{"id": "45062970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45062970", "title": "Kubo and the Two Strings", "text": "Kubo and the Two Strings\n\nKubo and the Two Strings is a 2016 American stop-motion action fantasy film directed and produced by Travis Knight (in his directorial debut). It stars the voices of Charlize Theron, Art Parkinson, Ralph Fiennes, Rooney Mara, George Takei, and Matthew McConaughey. It is the fourth feature film produced by Laika. The film revolves around Kubo, a young boy who wields a magical shamisen (a Japanese guitar) and whose left eye was stolen during infancy. Accompanied by an anthropomorphic snow monkey and beetle, he must subdue his mother's corrupted Sisters and his power-hungry grandfather Raiden (The Moon King), who is responsible for stealing his left eye.\n\n\"Kubo\" premiered at Melbourne International Film Festival and was released by Focus Features in the United States on August 19 to critical acclaim and grossed $77 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million. The film won the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film and was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature Film and Best Visual Effects, becoming the second animated film ever to be nominated in the latter category following 1993's \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", and the first film to be nominated for both.\n\nIn feudal Japan, 12-year-old eyepatched Kubo tends to his ill mother Sariatu (who bears a scar over her left eye as the result of a sailing accident at the beginning of the film) in a mountain cave near a small village. He earns their living by magically manipulating origami with music from his shamisen for the townsfolk, telling the tale of his missing father Hanzo, a samurai warrior. Kubo is never able to finish his story, as he does not know what happened to Hanzo and his mother herself cannot recall the ending due to her mental state deteriorating. Sariatu warns him not to stay out after dark as her Sisters, Karasu and Washi, and his estranged grandfather, the Moon King (who took his eye when he was a baby) will find him and take his remaining eye.\n\nOne day, Kubo learns of the village's Bon festival allowing them to speak to deceased loved ones. Kubo attends but is angry that Hanzo does not appear from his lantern, and forgets to return home before sunset. Karasu and Washi quickly find him and attack, but Sariatu suddenly appears and uses her magic to send Kubo far away, telling him to find his father's armor while she fights off her Sisters before the screen goes white.\n\nKubo wakes up in a distant land during a blizzard to find Monkey, his wooden snow monkey charm, who has come to life. While taking shelter inside the mangled corpse of a whale, Monkey tells him Sariatu is gone and the village destroyed. With help of \"Little Hanzo\", an origami figure based on Kubo's father, they set out to find the armor. Along the way, they meet Beetle, an amnesiac samurai who was cursed to take the form of a stag beetle/human hybrid but believes himself to have been Hanzo's apprentice in the past.\n\nKubo, Monkey, and Beetle find the \"Sword Unbreakable\" in the Hall of Bones, a cave guarded by a giant skeleton, but they defeat it and escape with the sword. They cross the Long Lake in a leaf boat to locate the \"Breastplate Impenetrable\" deep underwater. Kubo and Beetle swim down to retrieve it and encounter a sea monster, the \"Garden of Eyes\", who can entrance its victims with its many eyes by showing secrets and eating them. Kubo is caught in the creature's sight, but while entranced, comes to realize that Monkey is the reincarnated spirit of his mother. Beetle rescues the unconscious Kubo and obtains the Breastplate, but on returning to the boat, they find that Monkey has been badly wounded fighting and killing Karasu (as shown when her broken mask is floating in the ocean).\n\nThey go to shore to recover, where Monkey explains that she and her sisters were ordered by the Moon King to kill Hanzo, but she instead fell in love with him, and the Moon King branded her an enemy. That night, Kubo dreams of meeting Raiden, a blind elderly man, who points him towards the \"Helmet Invulnerable\" in Hanzo's abandoned fortress. They travel there the next day but realize too late it is a trap set by the Moon King and Washi. Washi reveals that Beetle is Hanzo, whom she and Karasu cursed for taking Sariatu away from them. Beetle is killed, and Monkey sacrifices herself, buying Kubo the time to use his shamisen to defeat Washi, breaking two of the three strings on it. Little Hanzo provides insight that the Helmet is actually the bell at the village, and Kubo breaks the last string to quickly travel there.\n\nAt the village, Kubo meets Raiden, who is revealed as the Moon King. He offers to take Kubo's other eye to make him immortal, but Kubo refuses. Raiden transforms into a giant \"Dunkleosteus\"-like dragon, the Moon Beast, and pursues Kubo and the remaining villagers into its cemetery. When Hanzo's armor proves ineffective, Kubo removes it and restrings his shamisen using his mother's hair, his father's bowstring, and his own lock of hair. With the instrument, he summons the spirits of the villagers' loved ones, who show the Moon Beast that memories are the strongest magic of all and can never be destroyed. Kubo and the spirits' magic protect themselves and the villagers from the Moon Beast, stripping him of his powers and leaving him a mortal human being without any memories. Spurred on by Kubo's stories, the villagers take compassion and tell Raiden he was a man of many positive traits, accepting him into the village. Kubo is able to speak to his parents' spirits during the subsequent Bon ceremony, as they watch the deceased villagers' lanterns transform into golden herons and fly to the spirit world into the sky.\n\n\nAnnounced in December 2014, the project is the directoral debut of Laika's CEO Travis Knight. Knight was pitched the story by production designer Shannon Tindle as a \"stop-motion samurai epic\". Although the studio had never ventured into the genre before, Knight was enthusiastic about the project; owing partly his affinity towards both the \"epic fantasy\" genre as well as Japanese culture in general.\n\nThe art took inspiration from such Japanese mediums as ink wash painting and origami among others. A particular influence came from the ukiyo-e wood block style, with Laika intending to make the entire film \"to look and feel as if it's a moving woodblock print\" Assistance came from 3D printing firm Stratasys who allowed Laika to use their newest technologies in exchange for feedback on them.\n\nFor the Skeleton monster the team created a giant 16-foot (4.9m), 400-pound (180 kg) puppet, which Laika claims is the record holder for largest stop-motion puppet. The idea to make such a massive puppet was born out of a fear that individual smaller parts (meant to represent the larger monster) would not work well on screen interacting with the other puppets. The resulting puppet was built in two parts which were then attached together by magnets. For movement Laika had to design a robot to easily manipulate it. The team at one point purchased an industrial robot off of eBay but found that it would not work with their setup.\n\nDario Marianelli composed and conducted the score for the film.\n\nThe film screened at the Melbourne International Film Festival on August 13, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 19, 2016.\n\n\"Kubo and the Two Strings\" grossed $48 million in North America and $29.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $77.5 million, against a budget of $60 million.\n\nIn the United States, the film was released on August 19, 2016, alongside \"Ben-Hur\" and \"War Dogs\", and was projected to gross $12–15 million from 3,260 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $515,000 from its Thursday night previews and $4.1 million on its first day. It went on to gross $12.6 million in its opening weekend, finishing 4th at the box office.\n\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 97% based on reviews from 201 critics, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Kubo and the Two Strings\" matches its incredible animation with an absorbing—and bravely melancholy—story that has something to offer audiences of all ages.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 85% overall positive score and a 63% \"definite recommend\".\n\nChristy Lemire of RogerEbert.com awarded the film 3.5 stars out of 4, saying that \"one of the most impressive elements of \"Kubo and the Two Strings\"—besides its dazzling stop-motion animation, its powerful performances and its transporting score—is the amount of credit it gives its audience, particularly its younger viewers.\" IGN's Samantha Ladwig gave the film 7.5/10, stating that the film is \"Dark, twisted, and occasionally scary, but also with humor, love, and inspiration.\" Jesse Hassenger, of \"The A.V. Club\", praised the film, saying that \"no American animation studio is better-suited to dreamlike plotting than Laika, and the animation of Kubo is truly dazzling, mixing sophistication and handmade charm with inspired flow.\"\n\nMichael O'Sullivan of \"The Washington Post\" gave the film 4/4 stars, stating that the film is \"both extraordinarily original and extraordinarily complex, even for a grown-up movie masquerading as a kiddie cartoon (which it kind of is).\" In \"The New York Times\", Glenn Kenny said that \"the movie's blend of stop-motion animation for the main action with computer-generated backgrounds is seamless, creating what is the most visually intoxicating of all Laika's movies.\" Peter Debruge of \"Variety\" wrote that \"\"Kubo\" offers another ominous mission for a lucky young misfit, this one a dark, yet thrilling adventure quest that stands as the crowning achievement in Laika's already impressive oeuvre.\"\n\nJonathan Pile of \"Empire\", wrote of the film: \"Yet another success for stop-motion giants Laika … boasts big laughs and effective scares in a typically gorgeous animated tale.\"\n\nWhile the film received critical acclaim for its craft and story, it was criticized for its perceived whitewashing as a movie set in ancient Japan but featuring a centrally white cast. George Takei and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa were the only actors of Asian descent playing the role of minor characters.\n\nAt the 89th Academy Awards, \"Kubo and the Two Strings\" was nominated for two awards, Best Animated Feature and Best Visual Effects.\n\n\"Kubo and the Two Strings\" was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital media on November 22, 2016.\n\n"}

Generally, liaison officers are used to achieve the best utilization of resources or employment of services of one organization by another. Liaison officers often provide technical or subject matter expertise of their parent organization. Usually an organization embeds a liaison officer into another organization to provide face-to-face coordination.\n\nIn the military, liaison officers may coordinate activities to protect units from collateral damage. They also work to achieve mutual understanding or unity of effort among desperate groups. For incidence or disaster management, liaison officers serve as the primary contact for agencies responding to the situation.\n\nIn the foreign service, community liaison officers support employees and family members who are assigned to foreign embassies. In the United States foreign service, they are charged with building community spirit and enhancing morale at post. Currently, CLOs operate at over 200 U.S. missions worldwide, including several unaccompanied posts such as Baghdad, Kabul, and Islamabad.\n\nSince one of the primary tasks of a liaison is often to coordinate activities between two or more organizations, people in these positions typically need to possess strong language and communication skills. This presents a challenge in the case of CLOs, who are posted to missions in their capacity as a spouse. Many have therefore not received the necessary training in order to be proficient in the local language prior to being posted overseas. According to some commentators, this makes it difficult for many CLOs to be effective at their jobs. In his words, Eddie Walsh argues, \"Unfortunately, it is hard to understand how CLO Coordinators can effectively liaise with the local community to provide 'programming, information, resources, and referrals' about off-post activities and on-the-economy services when they are not required to be fluent in the local language.\" Others disagree. For example, George Wilcox counters, \"In the 1990s my wife served twice as CLO, once in Central Asia, where she didn't speak the language and once in Brazil, where she did. She did an excellent job in both places, mostly because of her empathy for family members and her proactive involvement in helping them to adjust successfully to life in the two countries.\"\n\nA supporter liaison officer is a person within an association football club (or another sports club) functioning as a bridge between the club itself and supporters of the club. The SLO builds relations with the club management and the fans through two-way communication, informing supporters about decisions made by the club and informing the club about the fan's point of view. The SLO also works with security and police as well as the SLOs of other clubs to ensure that relevant knowledge is spread to all organisations participating in matches and other events of the club.\n"}

{"id": "5081318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5081318", "title": "Macedonia (terminology)", "text": "Macedonia (terminology)\n\nThe name Macedonia is used in a number of competing or overlapping meanings to describe geographical, political and historical areas, languages and peoples in a part of south-eastern Europe. It has been a major source of political controversy since the early 20th century. The situation is complicated because different ethnic groups use different terminology for the same entity, or the same terminology for different entities, with different political connotations.\n\nHistorically, the region has presented markedly shifting borders across the Balkan peninsula. Geographically, no single definition of its borders or the names of its subdivisions is accepted by all scholars and ethnic groups. Demographically, it is mainly inhabited by four ethnic groups, three of which self-identify as \"Macedonians\": two, a Bulgarian and a Greek one at a regional level, while a third ethnic Macedonian one at a national level. Linguistically, the names and affiliations of languages and dialects spoken in the region are a source of controversy. Politically, the rights to the extent of the use of the name \"Macedonia\" and its derivatives has led to a diplomatic dispute between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia. Despite mediation of the United Nations, the dispute is still pending resolution since 1993, but as a result it was admitted under the provisional reference of the \"former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\", sometimes abbreviated as FYROM.\n\nThe name \"Macedonia\" derives from the Greek (\"Makedonía\"), a kingdom (later, region) named after the ancient Macedonians, from the Greek (\"Makedones\"), \"Macedonians\", explained as having originally meant either \"the tall ones\" or \"highlanders\". The word (\"Makednon\") is first attested in Herodotus as the name which the Greek ethnos was called (which was later called Dorian) when it settled around Pindus mountain range. \"Makednon\" is related to the Ancient Greek adjective (\"makednós\"), meaning \"tall, slim\", attested in Homer and Hesychius of Alexandria in its feminine form \"μακεδνή\" (\"makednē\"), meaning \"long, tall\". It cognates with the words (\"makros\", \"long, large\") and (\"mēkos\", \"length\"), both deriving from the Indo-European root \"*mak-\", meaning \"long' or \"slender\". Linguist Robert S. P. Beekes claims that both terms are of Pre-Greek substrate origin and cannot be explained in terms of Indo-European morphology.\n\nThe region of Macedonia has been home to several historical political entities, which have used the name \"Macedonia\"; the main ones are given below. The borders of each of these entities were different.\n\nMacedonia or \"Macedon\", the ancient kingdom, was located on the periphery of Archaic and Classical Greece, and later became the dominant state of Hellenistic Greece. It was centered on the fertile plains west of the Gulf of Salonica (today north-western Greece); the first Macedonian state emerged in the 8th or early 7th century BC. Its extent beyond the center varied; some Macedonian kings could not hold their capital; Philip II expanded his power until it reached from Epirus, across Thrace to Gallipoli, and from Thermopylae to the Danube. His son Alexander the Great conquered most of the land in southwestern Asia stretching from what is currently Turkey in the west to parts of India in the east. However, while Alexander's conquests are of major historical importance as having launched the Hellenistic Age, Macedon as a state had no significant territorial gains due to them. Alexander's kingdom fell apart after his death in 323 BC; several of his Successors attempted to form a kingdom for themselves in Macedonia; the kingdom formed by Antigonus Gonatas contained all the land Philip II had started with and controlled much of what is now modern Greece; it lasted until the Romans divided it into four republics in 168 BC.\n\nThe ancient Romans had two different entities called \"Macedonia\", at different levels. Macedonia was established as a Roman province in 146 BC. Its boundaries were shifted from time to time for administrative convenience, but during the Roman Republic and the Principate it extended west to the Adriatic and south to Central Greece.\n\nUnder Diocletian, Thessaly, including parts of West Macedonia, was split off to form a new province, and the central and southern Balkan provinces were grouped into the Diocese of Moesia. At some point in the 4th century (first securely attested in 370) this was divided into two new dioceses, the mostly Latin-speaking Diocese of Dacia in the north and the mostly Greek-speaking Diocese of Macedonia in the south. Under Constantine the Great, the western part of the province of Macedonia was also split off to form the new province of Epirus nova. After Constantine's death, the western Balkans, Macedonia included, became part of the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum.\n\nWith the exception of a short-lived division between \"Macedonia Prima\" in the south and \"Macedonia Salutaris\" in the north towards the end of the 4th century (attested only in the \"Notitia Dignitatum\"), Macedonia formed a single province until re-divided into southern and northern parts sometime in the late 5th century (the division is first securely attested in 482), although the province seems to have been reunified by 535. According to the 6th-century \"Synecdemus\", \"Macedonia Prima\", with Thessalonica as its capital and governed by a \"consularis\", counted 32 cities, and \"Macedonia Secunda\" in the north, with Stobi as its capital and governed by a \"praeses\", only eight. The approximate boundary between the two ran on a rough line from north of Bitola (which belonged to \"Macedonia Prima\") to the area of Demir Kapija.\n\nDuring the 7th century, most of the Balkans were overrun by Slavic invasions, which left only the fortified towns and the coasts in the hands of the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire. \"Macedonia\" was then used for a new theme in the late 8th century under Irene of Athens. Geographically however it was located in Thrace and not in Macedonia, which was under the themes of Thessalonica, Strymon and other smaller commands such as Boleron or Drougoubiteia. Themes were not named geographically and the original sense was \"army\". They became districts during the military and fiscal crisis of the seventh century, when the Byzantine armies were instructed to find their supplies from the locals, wherever they happened to be. Thus the Armeniac theme was considerably west of Armenia; the Thracesian Theme was in Asia Minor, not in Thrace. The Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire acquired its name from its founder, Basil I the Macedonian, an Armenian by descent, who was born in the theme of Macedonia.\n\nThe interior of Macedonia remained in Slavic and later Bulgarian hands until the campaigns of Basil II, which ended the existence of the Bulgarian state and extended Byzantine authority across the central and northern Balkans. Thereafter Macedonia remained under Byzantine control until the Fourth Crusade (1204). A short-lived Latin Kingdom of Thessalonica was established which survived until 1224, when it was captured by Epirus. Most of Macedonia then came under the control of the Empire of Nicaea in 1246, although its northern regions remained disputed with the Serbs and the Bulgarians. Most of the region was conquered by the Serbs under Stephen Dushan during the Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347. Only Thessalonica and its environs remained in Byzantine hands. By the late 14th century, the Ottoman Turks in turn had conquered the region, although Thessalonica held out under Byzantine and later Venetian control until 1430.\n\nThe Ottomans did not keep Macedonia as an administrative unit: since 1864 parts of geographical Macedonia lay in three vilayets, which also comprised some non-Macedonian areas. The northern part was the Kosovo vilayet and then of Skopje; the Thessaloniki (south), and the Monastir Vilayet (western) were also created. This administrative division lasted until 1912–13, when Macedonia was divided among the Balkan states.\n\nSince the early stages of the Greek Revolution, the provisional government of Greece claimed Macedonia as part of Greek national territory, but the Treaty of Constantinople (1832), which established a Greek independent state, set its northern boundary between Arta and Volos. When the Ottoman Empire started breaking apart, \"Macedonia\" was claimed by all members of the Balkan League (Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and Bulgaria), and by Romania. Under the Treaty of San Stefano that ended the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78 the entire region, except Thessaloniki, was included in the borders of Bulgaria, but after the Congress of Berlin in 1878 the region was returned to the Ottoman Empire. The armies of the Balkan League advanced and occupied \"Macedonia\" in the First Balkan War in 1912. Because of disagreements between the allies about the partition of the region, the Second Balkan War erupted, and in its aftermath the arbitrary region of Macedonia was split into the following entities, that existed or still exist in this region:\n\nMacedonia (as a current geographical term) refers to a region of the Balkan peninsula in south-eastern Europe, covering some 60,000 or 70,000 square kilometers. Although the region's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state, in some contexts, the territory appears to correspond to the basins of (from west to east) the Haliacmon (Aliákmonas), Vardar / Axios and Struma / Strymónas rivers, and the plains around Thessaloniki and Serres.\n\nIn a historic context, the term \"Macedonia\" was used in various ways. Macedonia was not an administrative division of the Ottoman Empire; its entire territory was part of the \"beylerbeylik\" of Rumelia. The geographer H. R. Wilkinson suggests that the region \"defies definition\" but that many mappers agree \"on its general location\". Macedonia was well enough defined in 1897 for Gladstone to propose \"Macedonia for the Macedonians\"; philhellenes argued that the phrase could not be used by a man of impartiallity, while Turcophiles asserted that there are six different kinds of Macedonians, and only Turkish rule could prevail total anarchy in the region. The Balkan nations began to proclaim their rights to it after the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878 and its revision at the Congress of Berlin.\n\nMany ethnographic maps were produced in this period of controversy; these differ primarily in the areas given to each nationality within Macedonia. This was in part a result of the choice of definition: an inhabitant of Macedonia might well have different nationalities depending on whether the basis of classification was denomination, descent, language, self-identification or personal choice. In addition, the Ottoman census, taken on the basis of religion, was misquoted by all sides; descent, or \"race\", was largely conjectural; inhabitants of Macedonia might speak a different language at the market and at home, and the same Slavic dialect might be called Serbian \"with Bulgarian influences\", Macedonian, or West-Bulgarian.\n\nThese maps also differed somewhat in the boundaries given to Macedonia. Its only inarguable limits were the Aegean Sea and the Serbian and Bulgarian frontiers (as of 1885); where it bordered Old Serbia, Albania, and Thrace (all parts of Ottoman Rumelia) was debatable.\n\nThe Greek ethnographer Nicolaides, the Austrian Meinhard, and the Bulgarian Kǎnčev placed the northern boundary of Macedonia at the Šar Mountains and the Crna hills, as had scholars before 1878. The Serb Gopčevič preferred a line much further south, assigning the entire region from Skopje to Strumica to \"Old Serbia\"; and some later Greek geographers have defined a more restricted Macedonia. In addition, maps might vary in smaller details: as to whether this town or that was Macedonian. One Italian map included Prizren, where Nicolaides and Meinhard had drawn the boundary just south of it. On the south and west, Grevena, Korçë, and Konitsa varied from map to map; on the east, the usual line is the lower Mesta / Nestos river and then north or northwest, but one German geographer takes the line so far west as to exclude Bansko and Nevrokop / Gotse Delchev.\n\nThe region of Macedonia is commonly divided into three major and two minor sub-regions. The name \"Macedonia\" appears under certain contexts on the major regions, while the smaller ones are traditionally referred to by other local toponyms:\n\nThe region of Macedonia is commonly split geographically into three main sub-regions, especially when discussing the Macedonian Question. The terms are used in non-partisan scholarly works, although they are also used in ethnic Macedonian literature of an irredentist nature.\n\n\"Aegean Macedonia\" (or Greek Macedonia) refers to an area in the south of the Macedonia region. The borders of the area are, overall, those of ancient Macedonia in Greece. It covers an area of (for discussion of the reported irredentist origin of this term, see Aegean Macedonia).\n\n\"Pirin Macedonia\" (or Bulgarian Macedonia) is an area in the east of the Macedonia region. The borders of the area approximately coincide with those of Blagoevgrad Province in Bulgaria. It covers an area of .\n\n\"Vardar Macedonia\" (formerly Yugoslav Macedonia) is an area in the north of the Macedonia region. The borders of the area are those of the Republic of Macedonia. It covers an area of .\n\nIn addition to the above named sub-regions, there are also two smaller regions, in Albania and Serbia respectively. These regions are also considered geographically part of Macedonia. They are referred to by ethnic Macedonians as follows, but typically are not so referred to by non-partisan scholars.\n\nMala Prespa and Golo Brdo is a small area in the west of the Macedonia region in Albania, mainly around Lake Ohrid. It includes parts of the Korçë, Pogradec and Devoll districts. These districts in whole occupy about , but the area concerned is significantly smaller. Gora (part of the municipality of Dragaš) and Prohor Pčinjski are minor parts in the north of the Macedonia region in Serbia.\n\nThe region, as defined above, has a total population of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The ethnic Macedonian population of the Republic of Macedonia self-identify as \"Macedonian\" on a national level, while the Greek Macedonians self-identify as both \"Macedonian\" on a regional, and \"Greek\" on a national level. According to the Greek arguments, the ancient Macedonians' nationality was Greek and thus, the use of the term on a national level lays claims to their history. This disambiguation problem has led to a wide variety of terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the terminology by group section.\n\nThe self-identifying Macedonians (collectively referring to the inhabitants of the region) that inhabit or inhabited the area are:\n\nAs an ethnic group, Macedonians refers to the majority (64.7%, 2002) of the population of the Republic of Macedonia. Statistics for 2002 indicate the population of ethnic Macedonians within the country as c. 1,300,000. On the other hand, as a legal term, it refers to all the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, irrespective of their ethnic or religious affiliation. However, the preamble of the constitution distinguishes between \"the Macedonian people\" and the \"Albanians, Turks, Vlachs, Romanics and other nationalities living in the Republic of Macedonia\", but for whom \"full equality as citizens\" is provided. As of 2002 the total population of the country is 2,022,547.\n\nAs a regional group in Greece, Macedonians refers to ethnic Greeks (98%, 2001) living in regions referred to as Macedonia, and particularly Greek Macedonia. This group composes the vast majority of the population of the Greek region of Macedonia. The 2001 census for the total population of the Macedonia region in Greece shows 2,625,681.\n\nThe same term in antiquity described the inhabitants of the kingdom of Macedon, including their notable rulers Philip II and Alexander the Great who self-identified as Greeks.\n\nAs a regional group in Bulgaria, Macedonians refers to the inhabitants of Bulgarian Macedonia, who in their vast majority self-identify as Bulgarians at a national level and as \"Macedonians\" at a regional, but not ethnic level. As of 2001, the total population of Bulgarian Macedonia is 341,245, while the ethnic Macedonians living in the same region are 3,117. The \"Bulgarian Macedonians\" also self-identify as \"Piriners\" (пиринци, \"pirintsi\") to avoid confusion with the neighboring ethnic group.\n\nMacedo-Romanians can be used as an alternative name for Aromanians, people living throughout the southern Balkans, especially in northern Greece, Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and as an emigrant community in Northern Dobruja, Romania. According to Ethnologue, their total population in all countries is 306,237. This not very frequent appellation is the only one with the disambiguating portmanteau, both within the members of the same ethnic group and the other ethnic groups in the area. To make matters more confusing, Aromanians are often called \"Machedoni\" by Romanians, as opposed to the citizens of Macedonia, who are called \"Macedoneni\".\n\nThe ethnic Albanians living in the region of Macedonia, as defined above, are mainly concentrated in the Republic of Macedonia (especially in the northwestern part that borders Kosovo and Albania), and less in the Albanian minor sub-region of Macedonia around the Lake Ohrid. As of 2002, the total population of Albanians within the republic is 509,083 or 25.2% of the country's total population.\n\nAs language is one of the elements tied in with national identity, the same disputes that are voiced over demographics are also found in linguistics. There are two main disputes about the use of the word Macedonian to describe a linguistic phenomenon, be it a language or a dialect:\n\nThe origins of the Ancient Macedonian language are currently debated. At this time it is not conclusively determined whether the language/dialect was a Greek dialect related to Doric Greek\nor Aeolic Greek dialects among others, a sibling language of ancient Greek forming a \"Hellenic\" (i.e. Greco-Macedonian) supergroup, or viewed as an Indo-European language which is a close cousin to Greek (and perhaps somewhat related to Thracian or Phrygian languages). The scientific community generally agrees that, although sources are available (e.g. Hesychius' lexicon, Pella curse tablet) there is no decisive evidence to exclude any of the above hypotheses.\n\nModern Macedonian language, a south Slavic language, is unrelated to the Ancient Macedonian language. It is currently the subject of two major disputes. The first is over the name (alternative ways of referring to this language can be found in the terminology by group section and in the article Macedonian language naming dispute). The second dispute is over the existence of a Macedonian language distinct from Bulgarian, the denial of which is a position supported by nationalist groups, Bulgarian and other linguists and also by many ordinary Bulgarians.\n\nMacedonian is also the name of a dialect of Modern Greek, a language of the Indo-European family. Additionally, Macedo-Romanian is an Eastern Romance language, spoken in Southeastern Europe by the Aromanians.\n\nThe controversies in geographic, linguistic and demographic terms, are also manifested in international politics. Among the autonomous countries that were formed as a result of the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, was the (until then) subnational entity of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by the official name of \"Socialist Republic of Macedonia\", the others being Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. The peaceful break-away of that nation resulted in the change of its name to \"Republic of Macedonia\".\n\nRepublic of Macedonia is the constitutional name of the sovereign state which occupies the northern part of the geographical region of \"Macedonia\", which roughly coincides with the geographic subregion of Vardar Macedonia. \"The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" (FYROM) is a term used for this state by the main international organisations, including United Nations,\nEuropean Union,\nNATO,\nIMF,\nWTO,\nIOC,\nWorld Bank,\nEBRD,\nOSCE,\nFIFA,\nand FIBA.\nThe term was introduced in 1993 by the United Nations, following a naming dispute with Greece. Some countries use this term as a stop-gap measure, pending resolution of the naming dispute.\n\nGreece and the Republic of Macedonia each consider this name a compromise: it is opposed by some Greeks for containing the Greek self-identifying name \"Macedonia\", and by many in the Republic of Macedonia for not being the short self-identifying name. Greece uses it in both the abbreviated (\"FYROM\" or \"ΠΓΔΜ\") and spellout form (\"Πρώην Γιουγκοσλαβική Δημοκρατία της Μακεδονίας\").\n\nMacedonia refers also to a geographic region in Greece, which roughly coincides with the southernmost major geographic subregion of Macedonia. It is divided in the three administrative sub-regions (\"regions\") of West, Central, and East Macedonia and Thrace. The region is overseen by the Ministry for Macedonia–Thrace. The capital of Greek Macedonia is Thessaloniki, which is the largest city in the region of Macedonia; Greeks often call it the \"co-capital\" of Greece.\n\nEthnic Macedonian irredentists following the idea of a \"United Macedonia\" have expressed claims to what they refer to as \"Aegean Macedonia\" (in Greece), \"Pirin Macedonia\" (in Bulgaria), \"Mala Prespa and Golo Bardo\" (in Albania), and \"Gora and Prohor Pčinjski\" (in Serbia).\n\nLoring Danforth, a professor of anthropology at Bates College, asserts that ethnic Macedonian nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians, deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians. Danforth stresses, however, that the more moderate Macedonian position, publicly endorsed by Kiro Gligorov, the first president of the Republic of Macedonia, is modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the Great, but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well. They thus emphasize that the Macedonian language has a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by Saints Cyril and Methodius in the ninth century.\n\nAlthough ethnic Macedonians agree Macedonian minorities exist in Bulgaria and Greece and these minorities have been subjected to harsh policies of forced assimilation, there are two different positions with regard to what their future should be. These were summarized by Danforth:\n\nSchoolbooks and official government publications in the Republic have shown the country as part of an \"unliberated\" whole, although the constitution of the Republic, especially after its amendment in 1995, does not include any territorial claims.\n\nDanforth describes the Greek position on Macedonia as follows: because Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians were Greeks, and because ancient and modern Greece are bound in an unbroken line of racial and cultural continuity, it is only Greeks who have the right to identify themselves as Macedonians. According to Danforth, this is why Greeks generally refer to Ethnic Macedonians as \"Skopians\", a practice comparable to calling Greeks \"Athenians\". Danforth asserts that the negation of Macedonian identity in Greek nationalist ideology focuses on three main points: the existence of a Macedonian nation, a Macedonian language, and a Macedonian minority in Greece. More specifically, Danforth says:\n\nThus from the Greek nationalist perspective the use of the term \"Macedonian\" by the \"Slavs of Skopje\" constitutes a \"felony\", an \"act of plagiarism\" against the Greek people. Greek nationalists believe that, by calling themselves \"Macedonians\", the ethnic Macedonians are \"stealing\" a Greek name, \"embezzling\" Greek cultural heritage, and \"falsifying\" Greek history. Greek fears that the use of the name \"Macedonia\" by the ethnic Macedonians will inevitably lead to the assertion of irredentist claims to territory in Greek Macedonia are heightened by fairly recent historical events.\n\nFrom a different point of view, Demetrius Andreas M.-A. Floudas, of Hughes Hall, Cambridge, a leading commentator on the naming dispute from the Greek side, sums up this nationalistic reaction as follows: the Republic of Macedonia was accused of usurping the historical and cultural patrimony of Greece \"in order to furnish a nucleus of national self-esteem for the new state and provide its citizens with a new, distinct, non-Bulgarian, non-Serbian, non-Albanian identity\". The Republic emerged thus to Greek eyes as a country with a personality crisis, \"a nondescript parasitic state\" that lived off the history of its neighbours, because it allegedly lacked an illustrious past of its own, for the sake of achieving cohesion for what Greeks regarded as an \"unhomogeneous little new nation\". Floudas criticizes Greek stance as follows:\n\nAs of early 2008, the official position of Greece, adopted unanimously by the four largest political parties, has made a more moderate shift towards accepting a \"composite name solution\" (i.e. the use of the name \"Macedonia\" plus some qualifier), so as to disambiguate the former Yugoslav Republic from the Greek region of Macedonia and the wider geographic region of the same name.\n\n\nAll these controversies have led ethnic groups in Macedonia to use terms in conflicting ways. Despite the fact that these terms may not always be used in a pejorative way, they may be perceived as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from \"Macedonia\" to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.\n\nBulgarians and ethnic Macedonians seek to deny the self-identification of the Slavic speaking minority in northern Greece, which mostly self-identifies as Greek.\n\nCertain terms are in use by these groups as outlined below. Any denial of self-identification by any side, or any attribution of Macedonia related terms by third parties to the other side, can be seen as highly offensive. General usage of these terms follows:\n\n\n\nThe last eight terms are often considered offensive in the Republic of Macedonia.\n\n\nThe first three terms are often considered offensive in Greece.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3566463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3566463", "title": "Natural burial", "text": "Natural burial\n\nNatural burial is the interment of the body of a dead person in the soil in a manner that does not inhibit decomposition but allows the body to recycle naturally. It is an alternative to other contemporary Western burial methods and funerary customs.\n\nThe body may be prepared without chemical preservatives or disinfectants such as embalming fluid, which might destroy the microbial decomposers that break the body down. It may be buried in a biodegradable coffin, casket, or shroud. The grave does not use a burial vault or outer burial container that would prevent the body's contact with soil. The grave should be shallow enough to allow microbial activity similar to that found in composting. Natural burials can take place both on private land (subject to regulations) and in any cemetery that will accommodate the vault-free technique.\n\nWhile all natural burials seek to prevent environmental damage done by conventional techniques, some go a step further by using burial fees to acquire land to restore native habitat and save endangered species. Such land management techniques are called \"conservation burials.\" In addition to restoration ecology, and habitat conservation projects, others have proposed alternative natural uses of the land such as sustainable agriculture and permaculture, to maintain the burial area in perpetuity. Landscaping methods may accelerate or slow down the decomposition rate of bodies, depending on the soil system.\n\nThe first official conservation burial was established in the United States, however Natural Burial Grounds have been used previously in UK and the practice matches the methods used in many ancient and indigenous cultures.\n\nMany funeral directors encourage a viewing of a dead body at a commercial funeral home as part of a \"package\" that the family of the deceased pay for, without knowing that it is optional. The primary purpose of embalming is to delay decomposition long enough to allow the body to be viewed.\n\nIn many countries, the law requires that dead bodies be chilled with dry ice or mechanical refrigeration to prevent microbial growth, though there are no laws mandating embalming, contrary to popular belief. Many cultures around the world use no artificial cooling at all, and bodies are regularly held for several days before their final disposal.\n\nSpecial circumstances, such as an extended time between death and burial, or the transportation of remains on commercial flights (which often require unembalmed bodies to travel in expensive specialized containers), may necessitate embalming.\n\nThe most common embalming fluid is composed of organic chemicals and contains 5–29% formaldehyde, ethanol and water. This solution is biodegradable in time, but it cross-links proteins found in tissue-cell membranes, slowing down bacterial decomposition and inhibiting the body's breakdown in the earth. The ability of embalming fluid to contaminate soil or water tables has not been studied thoroughly. In alkaline soils, formaldehyde would be broken down through the Cannizzaro reaction and become urotropin, but not all soils are alkaline.\n\nFormaldehyde is highly toxic to all animals, and is \"known to be a human carcinogen\". It is implicated in cancer, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, disorders of the nervous system, and other ailments. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has the power to require embalmers to wear respirators.\n\nNatural coffins are made from materials that readily biodegrade. Ideally, the materials are easily renewed or recycled and require less energy for their production.\n\nCoffins (tapered-shoulder shape) and caskets (rectangular) are made from a variety of materials, most of them not biodegradable. 80–85% of the caskets sold for burial in North America in 2006 were of stamped steel. Solid wood and particle board (chipboard) coffins with hardwood veneers account for 10–15% of sales, and fiberglass and alternative materials such as woven fiber make up the rest. In Australia 85–90% of coffins are solid wood and particle board.\n\nMost traditional caskets in the UK are made from chipboard covered in a thin veneer. Handles are usually plastic designed to look like brass. Chipboard requires glue to stick the wood particles together. Some glues that are used, such as those that contain formaldehyde, are feared to cause pollution when they are burned during cremation or when degrading in the ground. However, not all engineered wood products are produced using formaldehyde glues.\n\nCaskets and coffins are often manufactured using exotic and even endangered species of wood, and are designed to prevent decomposition. While there are generally no restrictions on the type of coffin used, most sites encourage the use of environmentally friendly coffins made from materials like cane, bamboo, wicker or fiberboard. A weight bearing shroud is another option.\n\nNatural burial grounds employ a variety of methods of memorialization. Families that bury their loved ones in nature preserves can record the GPS coordinates of the location where they are buried, without using physical markers. Some natural burial sites use flat wooden plaques, or a name written on a natural rock. Many families plant trees, or other native plants near the grave to provide a living memorial.\n\nAlternatives to ground burials include: burial in a coral reef, sky burial and burial at sea.\n\nCremated remains are sometimes placed inside concrete coral reef balls, and ceremoniously placed in the sea as part of a reef ecosystem. These balls are used to repair damage to coral reefs, and to provide new habitat for fish and other sea life.\n\nIn some parts of Tibet and Mongolia, a person's remains are fed to vultures in a burial known as Sky burial. This is seen as being good to the environment as well as good karma in Buddhism.\n\nBurial at sea is seen as a natural burial if done in a way that benefits the environment, and without formaldehyde. Some organizations specialize in natural burial at sea (in a shroud), allowing the body to decompose or be consumed by animals.\n\nEach year, 22,500 cemeteries across the United States bury approximately:\n\nWhen formaldehyde is used for embalming, it breaks down, and the chemicals released into the ground after burial and ensuing decomposition are inert. The problems with the use of formaldehyde and its constituent components in natural burial are the exposure of mortuary workers to it and the destruction of the decomposer microbes necessary for breakdown of the body in the soil.\n\nNatural burial has been practiced for thousands of years, but has been interrupted in modern times by new methods such as vaults, liners, embalming, and mausoleums that mitigate the decomposition process. In the late 19th century Sir Francis Seymour Hayden proposed \"earth to earth burial\" in a pamphlet of the same name, as an alternative to both cremation and the slow putrefaction of encased corpses.\n\nThe Association of Natural Burial Grounds (ANBG) was established by The Natural Death Centre charity in 1994. It aims to help people to establish sites, to provide guidance to natural burial ground operators, to represent its members, and to provide a Code of Conduct for members. The NDC also publishes \"The Natural Death Handbook\".\n\nThe first woodland burial ground in the UK was created in 1993 at Carlisle Cemetery and is called \"The Woodland Burial\". Nearly 300 dedicated natural burial grounds have been created in the UK.\n\nEach province and territory within Canada has its own resources and regulations for handling death and the disposal of the body. In British Columbia, green burials are treated the same way as traditional burials, as embalming is not legally required for interment. All burials are required to follow the regulations set forth by their respective provincial government.\n\nWith growing interest in promoting eco-friendly practices, natural burials have been making rounds in various Canadian news outlets. Some debate still lies in what makes certain funeral practices eco-friendly and how cemeteries make these claims as no government-imposed standard or definition currently exist.\n\nEco-friendly funeral practices in Canada can include:\n\n\nCanada offers a wide range of environmentally-friendly services and alternatives to conventional funerary customs and corpse disposal practices in Canada. The Green Burial Council is an environmental certification organization for green burials practiced in North America (Canada and the US). Environmental certificates are offered to cemeteries, funeral homes, and product manufacturers involved in the funeral industry. These certificates would allow consumers to distinguish between the three different levels of green burial grounds and their appropriate standards. The Green Burial Council also offers information on the types of coffins, urns, and embalming tools that would fall under the eco-friendly category and be available for North American consumers.\n\nThe Green Burial Society of Canada was founded in 2013 with the goal to ensure standards of certification are set for green burial practices. The society emphasizes five principles of green burial: no embalming, direct earth burial, ecological restoration and conservation, communal memorialization, and the optimization of land use.\n\nThe Natural Burial Association (NBA) is an independent, non-profit organization established in 2005 to promote natural burial in Canada and to encourage the establishment of natural burial sites. The organization lists the four current natural cemetery sites on their website located in: Victoria, British Columbia, Cobourg, Ontario, Brampton, Ontario, and Pickering, Ontario.\nLocated in Victoria, British Columbia, the Royal Oak Burial Park opened the Woodlands grave site for green burial space in the cemetery since October 2008, dedicating its space to burials that allow for the natural decomposition of human remains which in turn provides nutrients for the surrounding ecosystem. The area has native-growing Coastal Douglas Fir along with a variety of ecologically similar tree species, which the cemetery claims to keep as close to the natural ecosystem as possible. In order to be interred in Royal Oak Burial Park, embalming of the body is prohibited. The body must be kept in its natural state, which is then placed in some form of biodegradable container or shroud. Traditional grave markers are not used, but rather families are given options to engrave natural boulders or plants.\n\nFound in Cobourg, Ontario, the Cobourg Union Cemetery is located on 20 acres of land, currently containing 3,800 burial lots. The cemetery is made up of both traditional burials with headstones and regular interment practices, as well as a green space dedicated to eco-friendly burials. Consumers are given information about biodegradable caskets and procedures for a green burial. Families are not allowed to place permanent markers on the grave sites other than native species of plants such as flowers and bushes.\nThe Meadowvale Cemetery originally opened in 1981 in Brampton, Ontario, with the green burial section of the cemetery opening in 2012. The cemetery allows for both burial and cremation as long as embalming is done without formaldehyde or other harsh chemicals. They also ensure that remains are placed into a non-toxic, biodegradable container. Graves are not allowed to be marked with traditional headstones, but they offer a granite stone at the site's entrance for name engraving.\n\nDuffin Meadows Cemetery is located in Pickering, Ontario, and is attached to the original traditional cemetery. The cemetery offers natural burials for individuals who have been embalmed to eco-friendly standards, then interred using biodegradable shrouds and caskets. Grave sites will be left to grow over naturally, meaning grass will not be mowed and the placement of artificial flowers and other markers will not be allowed.\n\nThere are a number of different natural burial parks across Australia, each of them slightly different in what they offer. One of the more advanced park is Lake Macquarie Memorial Park, on the Central Coast of New South Wales which contains a Natural Memorial reserve, dedicated to natural Burials.\n\nNew Zealand's Natural Burial organisation was started in 1999 by Mark Blackham. It is a not-for-profit organization that advocates for natural cemeteries, promotes the concept to the public, and certifies cemeteries, funeral directors and caskets for use in participating cemeteries.\n\nThe first natural cemetery in New Zealand was established in 2008 in the capital, Wellington, as a partnership between the Wellington City Council and Natural Burials. It is the nation's biggest natural cemetery, covering approx 2 hectares, and home to 120 burials (April 2015).\n\nMore natural cemeteries have since been set up by between Natural Burials and the council authorities in New Plymouth in 2011,Otaki in 2012. and Marlborough in 2014.\n\nOther councils have set up small natural burial zones: Marsden Valley in 2011, Motueka in 2012, and Hamilton in 2014. Although these have all based on the approach used by Natural Burials, they have not been certified by the organisation.\n\n<br>The Green Burial Council (GBC) is an independent, tax-exempt, nonprofit organization that aims to encourage sustainability in the interment industry and to use burial as a means of ecological restoration and landscape conservation. Founded in 2005, the GBC has been stewarded by individuals representing the environmental/conservation community, consumer organizations, academia, the deathcare industry, and such organizations and institutions as The Nature Conservancy, The Trust for Public Land, AARP, and the University of Colorado. The organization established the nation's first certifiable standards for cemeteries, funeral providers, burial product manufacturers, and cremation facilities. As of 2013, there are a total of 37 burial grounds certified by the Green Burial Council in 23 states and British Columbia. A cemetery becomes certified by demonstrating compliance with stringent established standards for a given category. Ramsey Creek Preserve mentioned below is certified by the GBC. Conventional funeral providers in thirty-nine states now offer the burial package approved by the Green Burial Council.<br><br>California: <br>Most of the Fernwood Burial Ground, adjacent to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in Mill Valley, California, is set aside for natural burial, with no tombstones or caskets.<br><br>Purissima Cemetery located in Half Moon Bay, California is a natural burial cemetery located south of Half Moon Bay California Operated by Steelmantown Cemetery.

{"id": "216283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216283", "title": "Nazca Lines", "text": "Nazca Lines\n\nThe Nazca Lines are a group of very large trenches in the Nazca Desert, in southern Peru. They were created between 500 BCE and 500 CE.\n\nThese geoglyphs are 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) deep, and between 0.4 and 1.1 km (.2 and .7 mi) wide. Their combined length is over 1,300 km (808 mi), and cover an area of about 50 sq km (19 sq mi).\n\nThey were made by scraping off the top layer of reddish-brown iron oxide-coated pebbles to reveal a yellow-grey subsoil.\n\nSome of the Nazca lines form shapes that are best seen from the air (~1,500 ft), though they are visible from the surrounding foothills and other high places. The shapes are usually made from one continuous line. The largest ones are about 370 m (1,200 ft) long.\n\nThe figures vary in complexity. Hundreds are simple lines and geometric shapes; more than 70 are zoomorphic designs of animals such as a hummingbird, spider, fish, llama, jaguar, monkey, lizard, dog and a human. Other shapes include trees and flowers.\n\nScholars differ in interpreting the purpose of the designs, but in general, they ascribe religious significance to them. They were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994.\n\nBecause of its isolation and the dry, windless, stable climate of the plateau, the lines have mostly been preserved naturally. Extremely rare changes in weather may temporarily alter the general designs. As of 2012, the lines are said to have been deteriorating because of an influx of squatters inhabiting the lands.\n\nThe high, arid plateau stretches more than between the towns of Nazca and Palpa on the \"Pampas de Jumana\", approximately south of Lima, roughly matching the main PE-1S Panamericana Sur. The main concentration is in a 10 by 4 km (6 mi by 2 mi) rectangle, south of \"San Miguel de la Pascana\" hamlet. In this area, the most notable geoglyphs are visible.\n\nAlthough some local geoglyphs resemble Paracas motifs, scholars believe the Nazca Lines were created by the Nazca culture.\n\nIn 1994, they were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\n<mapframe width=500 height=500 text=\"Nazca lines\" zoom=\"11\" longitude=\"-75.0600\" latitude=\"-14.6850\">\nSELECT ?id (if(bound(?image),'#c00','#f66') as ?stroke) (?stroke as ?fill) (6 as ?stroke_width)\nWHERE {\n</mapframe>\n\nThe first published mention of the Nazca Lines was by Pedro Cieza de León in his book of 1553, and he mistook them for trail markers.\n\nIn 1586, Luis Monzón reported having seen ancient ruins in Peru, including the remains of \"roads\". Although the lines were partially visible from the nearby hills, the first to report them were Peruvian military and civilian pilots. \n\nIn 1927 the Peruvian archaeologist Toribio Mejía Xesspe spotted them while he was hiking through the foothills. He discussed them at a conference in Lima in 1939.\n\nPaul Kosok, an American historian from Long Island University, is credited as the first scholar to study the Nazca Lines at length. In Peru in 1940–41 to study ancient irrigation systems, he flew over the lines and realized one was in the shape of a bird. Another chance observation helped him see how lines converged at the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. He began to study how the lines might have been created, as well as to try to determine their purpose. He was joined by archeologist Richard P. Schaedel from the United States, and Maria Reiche, a German mathematician and archaeologist from Lima, to help determine the purpose of the Nazca Lines. They proposed one of the earliest reasons for the existence of the figures: to be markers on the horizon to show where the sun and other celestial bodies rose on significant dates. Archaeologists, historians, and mathematicians have all tried to determine the purpose of the lines.\n\nDetermining how they were made has been easier than determining why they were made. Scholars have theorized the Nazca people could have used simple tools and surveying equipment to construct the lines. Archaeological surveys have found wooden stakes in the ground at the end of some lines, which supports this theory. One such stake was carbon-dated and was the basis for establishing the age of the design complex.\n\nRefuting the hypothesis of Erich von Däniken that the lines had to have been created by \"ancient astronauts\", prominent skeptic Joe Nickell has reproduced the figures using tools and technology available to the Nazca people. \"Scientific American\" called his work \"remarkable in its exactness\" when compared to the existing lines. With careful planning and simple technologies, Nickell proved that a small team of people could recreate even the largest figures within days, without any aerial assistance.\n\nMost of the lines are formed on the ground by a shallow trench with a depth between . Such trenches were made by removing the reddish-brown iron oxide-coated pebbles that cover the surface of the Nazca Desert. When this gravel is removed, the light-colored clay earth exposed in the bottom of the trench produces lines and contrasts sharply in color and tone with the surrounding land surface. This sublayer contains high amounts of lime which, with the morning mist, hardens to form a protective layer that shields the lines from winds, thereby preventing erosion.\n\nThe Nazca \"drew\" several hundred simple, but huge, curvilinear animal and human figures by this technique. In total, the earthwork project is huge and complex: the area encompassing the lines is nearly , and the largest figures can span nearly 370 m (1,200 ft). Some figures have been measured: the hummingbird is long, the condor is , the monkey is , and the spider is . The extremely dry, windless, and constant climate of the Nazca region has preserved the lines well. This desert is one of the driest on Earth and maintains a temperature near year round. The lack of wind has helped keep the lines uncovered and visible.\n\nThe discovery of two new small figures was announced in early 2011 by a Japanese team from Yamagata University. One of these resembles a human head and is dated to the early period of Nazca culture or earlier, and the other, undated, is an animal. In March 2012, the university announced a new research center would be opened at the site in September 2012 to study the area for the next 15 years. The team has been conducting field work there since 2006, when it had found approximately 100 new geoglyphs.\n\nThe Paracas culture is considered the precursor that influenced the development of the Nazca Lines. In 2018, drones used by archaeologists revealed many geoglyphs in the Palpa province that are being assigned to the Paracas culture. Many predate the associated Nazca lines by a thousand years. Some demonstrate a significant difference in the subjects and locations, such as some being on hillsides. Their co-discoverer, Peruvian archaeologist Luis Jaime Castillo Butters, indicates that many of these newly discovered geoglyphs represent warriors.\n\nAnthropologists, ethnologists, and archaeologists have studied the ancient Nazca culture to try to determine the purpose of the lines and figures. One hypothesis is that the Nazca people created them to be seen by deities in the sky. \n\nPaul Kosok and Maria Reiche advanced a purpose related to astronomy and cosmology, as has been common in other cultures: the lines were intended to act as a kind of observatory, to point to the places on the distant horizon where the sun and other celestial bodies rose or set in the solstices. Many prehistoric indigenous cultures in the Americas and elsewhere constructed earthworks that combined such astronomical sighting with their religious cosmology, as did the late Mississippian culture at Cahokia and other sites in present-day United States. Another example is Stonehenge in England.\n\nGerald Hawkins and Anthony Aveni, experts in archaeoastronomy, concluded in 1990 that the evidence was insufficient to support such an astronomical explanation.\n\nMaria Reiche asserted that some or all of the figures represented constellations. By 1998, Phyllis B. Pitluga, a protégé of Reiche and senior astronomer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, had concluded that the animal figures were \"representations of heavenly shapes\". According to \"The New York Times\", \"she contends they are not shapes of constellations, but of what might be called \"counter constellations\", the irregularly-shaped dark patches within the twinkling expanse of the Milky Way.\" Anthony Aveni criticized her work for failing to account for all the details.\n\nAlberto Rossell Castro (1977) proposed a multi-functional interpretation of the geoglyphs. He classified them into three groups: the first appeared to be tracks connected to irrigation and field division, the second are lines that are axes connected with mounds and cairns, and the third was linked to astronomical interpretations.\n\nIn 1985, archaeologist Johan Reinhard published archaeological, ethnographic, and historical data demonstrating that worship of mountains and other water sources predominated in Nazca religion and economy from ancient to recent times. He theorized that the lines and figures were part of religious practices involving the worship of deities associated with the availability of water, which directly related to the success and productivity of crops. He interpreted the lines as sacred paths leading to places where these deities could be worshiped. The figures were symbols representing animals and objects meant to invoke the aid of the deities in supplying water. The precise meanings of many of the individual geoglyphs remain unknown.\n\nHenri Stierlin, a Swiss art historian specializing in Egypt and the Middle East, published a book in 1983 linking the Nazca Lines to the production of ancient textiles that archeologists have found wrapping mummies of the Paracas culture. He contended that the people may have used the lines and trapezes as giant, primitive looms to fabricate the extremely long strings and wide pieces of textiles typical of the area. According to his theory, the figurative patterns (smaller and less common) were meant only for ritualistic purposes. This theory is not widely accepted, although scholars have noted similarities in patterns between the textiles and the Nazca Lines. They interpret these similarities as arising from the common culture.\n\nThe first systematic field study of the geoglyphs was made by Markus Reindel and Johny Cuadrado Island. Since 1996, they have documented and excavated more than 650 sites. They compared the iconography of the lines to ceramics of the cultures. As archeologists, they believe that the figurative motifs of geoglyphs can be dated to having been made between 200 and 600 BC.\n\nBased on the results of geophysical investigations and the observation of geological faults, Johnson argued that some geoglyphs followed the paths of aquifersm from which aqueducts (or \"puquios\") collected water.\n\nNicola Masini and Giuseppe Orefici have conducted research in Pampa de Atarco (at about 10 km south of Pampa de Nasca), which they believe reveals a spatial, functional and religious relationship between these geoglyphs and the temples of Cahuachi. In particular, they investigated using remote sensing techniques and found \"five groups of geoglyphs, each of them characterized by a specific motif and shape, and associated with a distinct function\". They identified a ceremonial one, characterized by meandering motifs. Another is related to calendrical purpose, as proved by the presence of radial centers aligned along the directions of winter solstice and equinox sunset. As have earlier scholars, the two Italians believe that the geoglyphs were the venues of events linked to the agriculture calendar. These also served to strengthen social cohesion among various groups of pilgrims, sharing common ancestors and religious beliefs.\n\nOther theories were that the geometric lines could indicate water flow or irrigation schemes, or be a part of rituals to \"summon\" water. The spiders, birds, and plants may be fertility symbols. It also has been theorized that the lines could act as an astronomical calendar.\n\nPhyllis Pitluga, senior astronomer at the Adler Planetarium and a protégé of Reiche, performed computer-aided studies of star alignments. She asserted the giant spider figure is an anamorphic diagram of the constellation Orion. She further suggested that three of the straight lines leading to the figure were used to track the changing declinations of the three stars of Orion's Belt. In a critique of her analysis, Dr. Anthony F. Aveni noted she did not account for the other 12 lines of the figure. \n\nHe commented generally on her conclusions, saying:\nI really had trouble finding good evidence to back up what she contended. Pitluga never laid out the criteria for selecting the lines she chose to measure, nor did she pay much attention to the archaeological data Clarkson and Silverman had unearthed. Her case did little justice to other information about the coastal cultures, save applying, with subtle contortions, Urton's representations of constellations from the highlands. As historian Jacquetta Hawkes might ask: was she getting the pampa she desired?\n\nJim Woodmann theorized that the Nazca lines could not have been made without some form of flight to observe the figures properly. Based on his study of available technology, he suggests a hot-air balloon was the only possible means of flight at the time of construction. To test this hypothesis, Woodmann made a hot-air balloon using materials and techniques he understood to have been available to the Nazca people. The balloon flew, after a fashion. Most scholars have rejected Woodmann's thesis as \"ad hoc\", because of the lack of any evidence of such balloons.\n\nPeople trying to preserve the Nazca Lines are concerned about threats of pollution and erosion caused by deforestation in the region.\n\nAfter flooding and mudslides in the area in mid-February 2007, Mario Olaechea Aquije, archaeological resident from Peru's National Institute of Culture, and a team of specialists surveyed the area. He said, \"[T]he mudslides and heavy rains did not appear to have caused any significant damage to the Nazca Lines\". He noted that the nearby Southern Pan-American Highway did suffer damage, and \"the damage done to the roads should serve as a reminder to just how fragile these figures are.\"\n\nIn 2012, squatters occupied land in the area, damaging a Nazca-era cemetery and allowing their pigs to have access to some of the land.\n\nIn 2013, machinery used in a limestone quarry was reported to have destroyed a small section of a line, and caused damage to another.\n\nIn December 2014, Greenpeace activists irreparably damaged the Nazca Lines while setting up a banner within the lines of one of the famed geoglyphs. The activists damaged an area around the hummingbird by grinding rocks into the sandy soil. Access to the area around the lines is strictly prohibited and special shoes must be worn to avoid damaging the UN World Heritage site. Greenpeace claimed the activists were \"absolutely careful to protect the Nazca lines\". This is contradicted by video and photographs showing the activists wearing conventional shoes (i.e. not special protective shoes) while walking on the site. Greenpeace has apologized to the Peruvian people, but Luis Jaime Castillo, Peru's vice minister of cultural heritage, called the apology \"a joke\", because Greenpeace initially refused to identify the vandals or accept responsibility. Culture Minister Diana Alvarez-Calderon said that evidence gathered during an investigation by the government would be used as part of a legal suit against Greenpeace. \"The damage done is irreparable and the apologies offered by the environmental group aren't enough,\" she said at a news conference. Facing increasing pressure, Greenpeace later released the identities of four of the activists involved. One of the activists, Wolfgang Sadik, was eventually fined and given a suspended prison sentence for his role in the incident.\n\nThe Greenpeace incident also directed attention to other damage to geoglyphs outside of the World Heritage area caused in 2012 and 2013 by off-road vehicles of the Dakar Rally, which is visible from satellite imagery.\n\nIn January 2018, an errant truck driver was arrested, but later released for lack of evidence indicating any intent other than simple error. He had damaged three of the geoglyphs by leaving substantial tire marks across an area of approximately 150 by 350 feet (46 m by 107 m).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Revision follows drafting and precedes editing. Drafting and revising often form a loop as a work moves back and forth between the two stages. It is not uncommon for professional writers to go through many drafts and revisions before successfully creating a written piece that is ready for the next stage: editing. Revision itself is not indicative of the quality of the text.\n\nIn their seminal book, \"The Elements of Style\", William Strunk, Jr. and E.B. White acknowledge the need for revision in the writing process: “Few writers are so expert that they can produce what they are after on the first try. Quite often you will discover, on examining the completed work, that there are serious flaws in the arrangement of the material, calling for transpositions... do not be afraid to experiment with your text.”\n\nFor an essay, a successful revision involves:\n\nIdentification of thesis. The purpose of the essay should be re-considered based on what has been written in the draft. If this purpose differs from the original thesis, the author must decide from which thesis to continue writing.\n\nConsideration of structure. The author should identify the strengths of the draft, then re-consider the order of those strengths, adjusting their placement as necessary so the work can build with auxesis to a crescendo.\n\nUncovering weakness in argument or presentation. Once the strengths of the draft have been identified and placed in the strongest order, the author can re-examine the work for weaknesses in argument or presentation. Faulty logic, missing transitions, and unsupported or poorly supported assertions are common weaknesses. Identifying these weaknesses during revision will inform the next draft.\n\nIn general, revision of written work can be guided by the following questions:\n\n\nSuccessful revision is not improving grammar or diction. Those will be the focus of later editing. However, there are instances when the writer or the author employs a strategy that involves a reviewing process. There are scholarship and theories citing this particular theme such as the case of the three-component model identified by Hayes and Flower and the James Britton's model of the writing process as a series of stages described in metaphors of linear growth, conception - incubation - production. Here, a review by the writer or a third party, which often entails corrective annotations, is part of the process that leads to the revision stage. Recently, due to the collaborative capabilities offered by the Internet, there are writers who \"crowdsource\" reviews from several people, who contribute digital annotations.\n"}

Sepak takraw differs from the similar sport of footvolley in its use of a rattan ball and only allowing players to use their feet, knee, chest and head to touch the ball.\n\nIn Indonesia, and Singapore, it is called \"sepak takraw\". In Malaysia, it is called as \"sepak raga.\" In Thailand, it is called as \"takraw\" only. In Laos, it is \"kataw\" (). In the Philippines, besides the borrowed term \"takraw\", it is also known by its native name \"sipa\", meaning \"kick\". In Myanmar, it is known as \"chin lone\", and is considered more of an art as there is often no opposing team, and the point is to keep the ball aloft gracefully and interestingly. \n\nSimilar games include footbag net, footvolley, football tennis, bossaball, jianzi, jokgu and sipa.\n\n\"Sepak\" is the Malay word for kick and \"takraw\" is the Thai word for a woven rattan ball; therefore sepak takraw quite literally means \"to kick a ball\".\n\nSepak takraw is known in many names across Southeast Asia; including ; ; , , ; , \"Pike Kyaw Chin\"; , ; , \"Sei Dak\"; , \"ka-taw\"; , \"calameae ball\" or \"rattan ball\".\n\nThe earliest historical evidence shows the game was played in the 15th century's Malacca Sultanate, for it is mentioned in the Malay historical text, \"Sejarah Melayu\" (Malay Annals). The Malay Annals described in details the incident of Raja Muhammad, a son of Sultan Mansur Shah who was accidentally hit with a rattan ball by Tun Besar, a son of Tun Perak, in a Sepak raga game. The ball hit Raja Muhammad's headgear and knocked it down to the ground. In anger, Raja Muhammad immediately stabbed and killed Tun Besar, whereupon some of Tun Besar's kinsmen retaliated and wanted to kill Raja Muhammad. However, Tun Perak managed to restrain them from such an act of treason by saying that he would no longer accept Raja Muhammad as the Sultan's heir. As a result of this incident, Sultan Mansur Shah ordered his son out of Malacca and had him installed as the ruler of Pahang.\n\nIn Indonesia, sepak takraw was spread from nearby Malacca across the strait to Riau islands and Riau area in Sumatra as early as the 16th century, where it is also called as \"Sepak Raga\" in local Malay tongue, at that time some of Sumatran areas were part of Malacca sultanate. From there the Malay people spread across archipelago and introduced the game to Buginese people in Sulawesi. Then the game is developed as Buginese traditional game which is called \"Raga\" (the players are called \"Pa'Raga\"). The \"Raga\" can trace its origin from Malacca Sultanate, and was popular in South Sulawesi since the 19th century. Some men playing \"Raga\" encircling within a group, the ball is passed from one to another and the man who kicked the ball highest is the winner. \"Raga\" is also played for fun by demonstrating some tricks, such as kicking the ball and putting it on top of player's head holds by \"tengkolok bugis\" (Bugis cloth headgear similar to Malay \"tanjak\").\n\nIn Thailand (formerly Siam), there was evidence that the Thai had played Sepak Takraw since the Ayutthaya Kingdom, at least during the reign of King Naresuan (1590–1605). A French historian, François Henri Turpin, wrote about how the Siamese played the game of takraw to stay in shape. Murals at Bangkok's Wat Phra Kaeo which was built in 1785, depict the Hindu god Hanuman playing sepak takraw in a ring with a troop of monkeys. The game was played in its circle form for hundreds of years, and the modern version of \"sepak takraw\" began taking shape in Thailand sometime during the early 1740s. In 1929 the Siam Sports Association drafted the first rules for takraw competition. Four years later, the association introduced the volleyball-style net and held the first public contest. Within just a few years, takraw was introduced to the curriculum in Siamese schools. The game became such a cherished local custom that another exhibition of volleyball-style takraw was staged to celebrate the kingdom's first constitution in 1933, the year after Thailand abolished absolute monarchy.\n\nIn the Philippines the sport was called \"sipa\" and along with traditional martial arts survived the three century Spanish colonisation. It is a popular sport played by children in Philippines. It was the Philippine national sport until it was replaced by arnis in 2009. Sepak Takraw is included in Philippine's elementary and highschool curriculum. In Myanmar, or Burma, it was dubbed \"chinlone\", in Laos \"kator\", \"cầu mây\" in Vietnam and in Indonesia \"raga\" or \"sepak takraw\".\n\nSome believed that many variations of the game evolved from cuju, an ancient Chinese military exercise, where soldiers would try to keep a feathered shuttlecock airborne by kicking it back and forth between two people. As the sport developed, the animal hide and chicken feathers were eventually replaced by balls made of woven strips of rattan.\n\nThe first versions of sepak takraw were not so much of a competition, but rather cooperative displays of skill designed to exercise the body, improve dexterity and loosen the limbs after long periods of sitting, standing or working.\n\nBy the 1940s, the net version of the game had spread throughout Southeast Asia, and formal rules were introduced. This sport became officially known as \"sepak takraw\".\n\nInternational play is now governed by ISTAF, the International Sepak Takraw Federation. Major competitions for the sport such as the ISTAF SuperSeries, the ISTAF World Cup and the King's Cup World Championships are held every year.\n\nSepak takraw is now a regular sport event in the Asian Games and the Southeast Asian Games.\n\nSepak takraw has been a sport at the Asian Games since 1990 with Thailand securing the highest number of gold medals.\n\nThe Lao people first brought sepak takraw into Canada when they immigrated as refugees in the 1970s. But the game got exposure outside the Laotian communities and really started taking off when a Saskatchewan teacher, Richard (Rick) Engel, who encountered sepak takraw while living in Asia, included it in Asian Sport, Education & Culture (ASEC) International's School Presentation Program. Sepak takraw was so well received by schools that it became part of ASEC's mandate to help introduce, promote and organise the sport right across the country. In May 1998, after getting many schools playing sepak takraw, and by networking with experienced players, ASEC International organised the first Canadian inter-provincial tournament to include men's, boys and girls teams. By the end of 1998, Engel was sent to Bangkok, Thailand to film at the 14th King's Cup Sepak Takraw World Championships – the footage of which was used to produce a widely used instructional sepak takraw video/DVD, called \"Sepak Takraw – Just for Kicks\".\n\nOn 11 December 1998, the Sepak Takraw Association of Canada (STAC) was incorporated to organise and govern the sport nationally. Its office was set up in Regina, SK, where there are experienced players and organisational support, and where it could share the resources and office space of the already established ASEC International, a committee from which has now become Sepak Takraw Saskatchewan Inc. The first annual Canadian Open Sepak Takraw Championships (a national and international tournament event) were held in May 1999 in Regina, SK, and have over the years attracted teams from across Canada, the United States, Japan, Malaysia and China. That same year Canada also attended its first International Sepak Takraw Federation (ISTAF) Congress and was accepted as members of ISTAF, which governs the sport globally. In 2000, Rick Engel, Perry Senko and Brydon Blacklaws played for Team Canada and earned a silver medal in the entry level division of the King's Cup World Sepak Takraw Championships in Thailand. Another major milestone was achieved on 3 December 2000, when STAC and the sport of sepak takraw became an official class E Member of the Canadian Olympic Committee.\n\nCanada has since contributed much to the development of sepak takraw worldwide, with Engel authoring three instructional sepak takraw books and helping produce five sepak takraw DVDs, while STAC does the publishing. The most notable of these books is \"Sepak Takraw 101 - The Complete Coaching/Instructional Manual for Sepak Takraw (Kick Volleyball)\", the third edition of which has also been translated and published in the Indonesian language and released in Indonesia through a government education project. Engel has found himself to be in demand, introducing the sport and conducting sepak takraw skills clinics in schools and sessions at physical education teachers' conferences all over Canada, the US and Europe.\n\nA Japanese team played at the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing. While as of 2010 there are no professional teams in Japan, university level teams had been established at Asia University, Chiba University, Keio University, and Waseda University.\n\nThe earliest accounts of organized takraw in the United States involve a group of students from Northrop University (Greg St. Pierre, Thomas Gong, Joel \"big bird\" Nelson, and Mark Kimitsuka) in 1986 in Inglewood, California, learning about and playing the sport in Los Angeles. In the early 80s, Southeast Asians held soccer tournaments that had takraw events in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and California, especially within the Lao, Hmong and Thai communities. Malaysian students attending the University often enjoyed playing the sport on a court on top of the dormitory cafeteria. They taught a handful of curious American students how to play, which in turn inspired Malaysia Airlines to sponsor a US team from the university to attend the National Tournament in Kuala Lumpur in November 1987. The Northrop team played in a bracket of international new teams with Korea, Sri Lanka, and Australia. The US team beat Sri Lanka and Australia to bring home the gold.\n\nTakraw really began to take off, however, in the late 1980s when Kurt Sonderegger, an American working in Switzerland, met a fellow American who showed him a bouncy ball made of woven strips of rattan. The traveller told Sonderegger that the ball was from Thailand and gave him the ball as a gift. Sonderegger was a soccer fan, and takraw had an immediate appeal to him. On a whim, Sonderegger booked a trip to Thailand to find out more. While in Thailand, Sonderegger discovered the actual sport of sepak takraw and was hooked.\n\nLos Angeles's Asian community and Northrop's team had already established a takraw community in and around L.A. Sonderegger moved to Los Angeles, founded the United States Takraw Association, and started a business that sold plastic takraw balls. In 1989, he was sent an invitation from the International Sepak Takraw Federation, and Sonderegger along with a few of the Northrop group travelled to represent the United States in the World Championships.\n\nThe team was beaten badly but the takraw world was enchanted with the fact that non-Asian teams had competed at the World Championships.\n\nMeasurements of courts and equipment often vary among tournaments and organisations that operate from a recreational to a competitive level; \"international competitive rules and regulations are used in this section.\" There are two types of event categories: the regu and the doubles regu. The regu category is played by three players on each team while the doubles regu is played by two players on each team.\n\n\"Takraw\" is the Thai word for the hand-woven rattan ball originally used in the game. Therefore, the game is essentially \"kick ball\". The concept of Footvolley originates from Thai Takraw pronounced (Tha-Graw) Also, sometimes misnamed by foreigners as \"Shaolin Soccer\" however it is an ancient game mainly enjoyed between Thai and Laos.\n\nThe sepak takraw sport is played on a similar to badminton double sized court.\n\nArea of free from all obstacles up to the height of measured from the floor surface (sand and grass court not advisable). The width of the lines bounding the court should not be more than measured and drawn inwards from the edge of the court measurements. All the boundary lines should be drawn at least away from all obstacles.\nThe centre line of should be drawn equally dividing the right and left court.\n\nAt the corner of each at the center line, the quarter circle shall be drawn from the sideline to the center line with a radius of measured and drawn outwards from the edge of the 0.9 m radius.\n\nThe service circle of 0.3 m radius shall be drawn on the left and on the right court, the center of which is 2.45 m from the back line of the court and 3.05 m from the sidelines, the 0.04 m line shall be measured and drawn outward from the edge of the 0.3 m radius.\n\nThe net shall be made of fine ordinary cord or nylon with 6 cm to 8 cm mesh. Similar to a volleyball net.\n\nThe net shall be 0.7 m in width and not shorter than 6.10 m in length and taped at 0.05 m from tape double at the top and sideline, called boundary tape.\n\nThe net shall be edged with 0.05 m tape double at the top and the bottom of the net supported by a fine ordinary cord or nylon cord that runs through the tape and strain over and flush with the top of the posts. The top of the net shall be 1.52 m (1.42 m for women) in height from the center and 1.55 m (1.45 m for women) at the posts.\n\nThe sepak takraw ball shall be spherical, made of synthetic fibre or one woven layer.\n\nSepak takraw balls without synthetic rubber covering must have 12 holes and 20 intersections, must have a circumference measuring not less from for men and from for women, and must have a weight that ranges from for men and from for women.\n\nThe ball can be in plain single colour, multi-colour, and luminous colours, but not in any colour that will impair the performance of the players.\n\nThe sepak takraw ball can also be constructed of synthetic rubber or soft durable material for covering the ball, for the purpose of softening the impact of the ball on the player's body. The type of material and method used for constructing the ball or for covering the ball with rubber or soft durable covering must be approved by ISTAF before it can be used for any competition.\n\nAll world, international, and regional competitions sanctioned by International Sepak Takraw Federation, including but not limited to, the Olympic Games, World Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and SEA Games, must be played with ISTAF approved sepak takraw balls.\n\nA match is played by two teams called 'regu', each consisting of three players. On some occasions, it can be played by only two players (doubles) or four players (quadrant) per team.\n\nOne of the players shall be at the back; he/she is called a \"Tekong\". The other two players shall be in front, one on the left and the other on the right. The player on the left is called a \"feeder/setter/tosser\" and the player on the right is called a \"attacker/striker/killer\".\n\nThe side that must serve first shall start the first set. The side that wins the first set shall have the options of \"Choosing Service\".\n\nThe throw must be executed as soon as the referee calls the score. If either of the \"Inside\" players throws the ball before the referee calls the score, it must be re-thrown and a warning will be given to the thrower.\n\nDuring the service, as soon as the Tekong kicks the ball, all the players are allowed to move about freely in their respective courts.\n\nThe service is valid if the ball passes over the net, whether it touches the net or not, and inside the boundary of the two net tapes and boundary lines of the opponent's court.\n\n\n\n\nAn official doubles or regu match is won by best of three sets (win 2 out of 3 sets), with each set being played up to 21 points.\n\nA team event or group match is effectively three regu matches played back to back, using different players for each regu. The winner is determined by best of three regus (win 2 out of 3 regus), where a winner of each individual regu is determined by best of 3 sets, played up to 21 points per set.\n\nIn the last 3rd set the change of sides takes place when one team reaches 11 points.\n\nPoint: when either serving side or receiving side commits a fault, a point is awarded to the opponent side.\n\nInternational play is now governed by ISTAF, the International Sepak Takraw Federation\nServing: Teams alternate serve every three points, regardless of who wins the points. I.e., each team serves three times, then the other team serves three times, and so on. If a tie takes place at 21-21, each team alternates one serve each until a winner is determined.\n\nSet: each set is won by the side which scores 21 points with a minimum lead of two points to a ceiling of 25 points. In the event of a 21-21 tie, the set shall be won by the side which gets a lead of two points, or when a side reaches 25 points (whichever occurs first).\n\nMatch: a match is won by the team who has won two sets. A team event match is won by the team that wins two regus.\n\nRanking: in group stages of tournaments or team events (round robin) the ranking in a group is determined by:\n1. Sum of match wins; a match win gives 1 point\n2. Sum set points\n3. Point difference +/-\n\n\n\nEurope\nAsia\nAmericas\nOceania\nAfrica\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3038388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3038388", "title": "Somali phonology", "text": "Somali phonology\n\nThis article describes the phonology of the Somali language.\n\nCommon Somali has 23 consonant phonemes. Its consonants cover every place of articulation on the IPA chart, though not all of these distinctions are phonemic.\n\nThe voiced affricate /dʒ/ is missing in many northern and eastern dialects, with the voiceless affricate /tʃ/ taking its place. \n\nThe voiceless stops and are always aspirated.\n\n, the voiced pharyngeal fricative, may have creaky voice.\n\n/q/ can, in some dialects, be pronounced as a /x/.\n\nSomali has five vowel articulations that all contrast murmured and harsh voice as well as vowel length. There is little change in vowel quality when the vowel is lengthened. Each vowel has a harmonic counterpart, and every vowel within a harmonic group (which notably can be larger than a word in Somali) must harmonize with the other vowels. The Somali orthography, however, does not distinguish between the two harmonic variants of each vowel.\n\nThere are five diphthongs that also occur in front and back, long and short versions, except for , which does not appear to occur in the back series.\n\nLexical prominence in Somali can be classified under a pitch accent system, in which there is one high-tone mora per word.\n\nThe tone system distinguishes both grammatical and lexical differences. Differences include numbers singular and plural (a grammatical distinction), and masculine and feminine genders (a grammatical and sometimes also lexical distinction). One example is \"inán\" ('girl') versus \"ínan\" ('boy'). This reflects a tonal pattern that codes grammatical gender, such as \"dameér\" ('female donkey') versus \"daméer\" ('male donkey').\n\nThe question of the tone system in Somali has been debated for decades. The modern consensus is as follows.\n\nIn Somali, the tone-bearing unit is the mora rather than the vowel of the syllable. A long vowel or a diphthong consists of two morae and can bear two tones. Each mora is defined as being of high or low tone. Only one high tone occurs per word and this must be on the final or penultimate mora. Particles do not have a high tone. (These include prepositions, clitic pronouns for subject and object, impersonal subject pronouns and focus markers.) There are therefore three possible \"accentual patterns\" in word roots.\n\nPhonetically there are three tones on long vowels: high, low and falling:\n\nThis use of tone may be characterized as pitch accent. It is similar to that in Oromo.\n\nStress is connected with tone. The high tone has strong stress; the falling tone has less stress and the low tone has no stress.\n\nWhen needed, the conventions for marking tone on written Somali are as follows:\n\nTones on long vowels are marked on the first vowel symbol.\n\nThe syllable structure of Somali is (C)V(C).\n\nRoot morphemes usually have a mono- or di-syllabic structure.\n\nClusters of two consonants do not occur word-initially or word-finally, i.e., they only occur at syllable boundaries. The following consonants can be geminate: , , , , , , , and . The following cannot be geminate: , and the fricatives.\n\nTwo vowels cannot occur together at syllable boundaries. Epenthetic consonants, e.g. and , are therefore inserted.\n\n\nWhen a vowel occurs in word-initial position, a glottal stop () is inserted before it.\n\nTrisyllabic roots with the form (C)VCVCV and a short second vowel elide this vowel to become (C)VCCV except if it would result in or occurring at the end of a syllable or being geminate.\n\nPhonological changes occur at morpheme boundaries (sandhi) for specific grammatical morphemes. There may be assimilation or elision. One unusual change which can occur is to .\n\nCoalescence also occurs. This is a kind of external sandhi in which words join, undergoing phonological processes such as elision. In Somali it is sometimes obligatory and sometimes it is dependent on the speech style.\n\nRoots have front-back vowel harmony. There is also a process of vowel harmony in strings longer than a word, known as \"harmonic groups\".\n\nIntonation (as opposed to tone, see above) does not carry grammatical information although it may convey the speaker's attitude or emotion.\n\n"}
{"id": "2020451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020451", "title": "Star Wars prequel trilogy", "text": "Star Wars prequel trilogy\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy is a set of three prequel films in the \"Star Wars\" franchise, an American space opera created by George Lucas. Like the original trilogy, it was produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and distributed by 20th Century Fox. The trilogy consists of \"\" (1999), \"\" (2002), and \"\" (2005). The first two films received mixed reviews, while the third was somewhat more well received.\n\nAccording to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films. In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted, but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy and pressure from his wife to settle down, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981.\n\nTechnical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery, inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequel trilogy would be \"unbelievably expensive.\" After viewing an early CGI test created by Industrial Light & Magic for \"Jurassic Park\", Lucas said:\nWe did a test for Steven Spielberg; and when we put them up on the screen I had tears in my eyes. It was like one of those moments in history, like the invention of the lightbulb or the first telephone call. A major gap had been crossed and things were never going to be the same.\n\nIn 1992, Lucas acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy in the \"Lucasfilm Fan Club\" magazine, and announced this to \"Variety\" in late 1993. Producer Rick McCallum reached out to Frank Darabont, who had had previously written \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption\", for possible future writing duties. He was considered until at least 1995, but as time went on, Lucas continued writing the screenplays himself. The popularity of the franchise had been prolonged by the \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe, so that it still had a large audience. A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 \"updated\" the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new episodes.\n\n\"\" was released on May 19, 1999, and \"\" on May 16, 2002, both to mixed reviews. \"\", the first film in the franchise, was released on May 19, 2005. The plot of the trilogy focuses on the fall of the Galactic Republic, the formation of the Empire, and the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker's turn to the dark side.\n\n32 years before the events of the original film, two Jedi, acting as negotiators of the Republic, discover that the corrupt Trade Federation has formed a blockade around the planet Naboo. Sith Lord Darth Sidious has secretly caused the blockade to give his alter ego, Senator Palpatine, a pretense to overthrow and replace the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, encounter a native of Naboo who helps them find the Queen of Naboo. With Queen Padmé Amidala, they escape the blockade, but not without their starship being damaged. Landing on Tatooine for repairs, they meet a nine-year-old slave named Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon helps liberate the boy by betting with his master in a podrace, believing him to be the \"Chosen One\" prophesied by the Jedi to bring balance to the Force. Sidious dispatches his Sith apprentice, Darth Maul, to attack the Queen's Jedi protectors. Arriving on Coruscant so the Queen can plead Naboo's crisis before the Republic Senate, Anakin is brought before the Jedi Council, where Yoda senses that he possesses too much fear.\n\nThe prequels were originally planned to fill in history tangential to the original trilogy, but Lucas realized that they could form the first half of one long story focusing on Anakin. This would shape the film series into a self-contained saga. In 1994, Lucas began writing the screenplay for the first prequel, initially titled \"Episode I: The Beginning\". Following the film's release, Lucas announced that he would be directing the next two.\n\n10 years after the Battle of Naboo, an assassination attempt is made on former Queen Padmé Amidala, who is serving as the Senator of Naboo. Obi-Wan and his apprentice Anakin are assigned to protect her; Obi-Wan tracks the killer, while Anakin and Padmé retreat to Naboo. They soon fall in love with each other, albeit secretly due to the Jedi Order's rule against attachment. Meanwhile, Chancellor Palpatine schemes to draw the entire galaxy into the \"Clone War\" between the Republic army led by the Jedi, and the Confederacy of Independent Systems led by Count Dooku (the former master of Obi-Wan's deceased master Qui-Gon, and Palpatine's new Sith apprentice).\n\nThe first draft of \"Episode II\" was completed just weeks before principal photography, and Lucas hired Jonathan Hales, a writer from \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\", to polish it. Unsure of a title, Lucas had jokingly called the film \"Jar Jar's Great Adventure\". In writing \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Lucas initially considered that Lando Calrissian was a clone from a planet of clones which caused the Clone Wars mentioned in \"A New Hope\". He later came up with the concept of an army of clone shock troopers from a remote planet which attacked the Republic and were resisted by the Jedi.\n\nThree years into the Clone Wars, Anakin and Obi-Wan lead a rescue mission to save Chancellor Palpatine from Count Dooku and the droid commander General Grievous. Anakin begins to have prophetic visions of his secret wife Padmé dying in childbirth. Palpatine, who had been secretly engineering the Clone Wars to destroy the Jedi Order, convinces Anakin that the dark side of the Force holds the power to save Padmé's life. Desperate, Anakin submits to Palpatine and is renamed Darth Vader. Palpatine orders the clone army to fire on their Jedi generals, and declares the former Republic an Empire. Vader participates in the extermination of the Jedi, culminating in a lightsaber duel with Obi-Wan on the volcanic planet Mustafar.\n\nWork on \"Episode III\" began before \"Episode II\" was released, with one scene shot during the earlier film's production. Lucas originally told concept artists that the film would open with a montage of the Clone Wars, and included a scene of Palpatine revealing to Anakin that he had willed his conception through the Force. Lucas reviewed and radically reorganized the plot, having Anakin execute Dooku in the first act to foreshadow his fall to the dark side. After principal photography was completed in 2003, Lucas made more changes, rewriting Anakin's arc. He would now primarily turn to the dark side in a quest to save Padmé, rather than just believing that the Jedi are plotting to take over the Republic. The rewrite was accomplished both through editing principal footage, and filming new and revised scenes during pick-ups in 2004.\n\nCitations\nWorks cited\n"}

Strawson used the term \"Statement\" to make the point that two declarative sentences can make the same statement if they say the same thing in different ways. Thus in the usage advocated by Strawson, \"All men are mortal.\" and \"Every man is mortal.\" are two different sentences that make the same statement.\n\nIn either case a statement is viewed as a truth bearer.\n\nExamples of sentences that are (or make) statements:\n\n\nExamples of sentences that are not (or do not make) statements:\n\n\nThe first two examples are not declarative sentences and therefore are not (or do not make) statements.\nThe third and fourth are declarative sentences but, lacking meaning, are neither true nor false and therefore are not (or do not make) statements. The fifth and sixth examples are meaningful declarative sentences, but are not statements but rather matters of opinion or taste. Whether or not the sentence \"Pegasus exists.\" is a statement is a subject of debate among philosophers. Bertrand Russell held that it is a (false) statement. Strawson held it is not a statement at all.\n\nIn some treatments \"statement\" is introduced in order to distinguish a sentence from its informational content. A statement is regarded as the information content of an information-bearing sentence. Thus, a sentence is related to the statement it bears like a numeral to the number it refers to.

{"id": "4608472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4608472", "title": "Sub-Saharan African music traditions", "text": "Sub-Saharan African music traditions\n\nAfrican music traditions exhibit so many common features that they may in some respects be thought of as constituting a single musical system. While some African music is clearly contemporary-popular music and some is art-music, still a great deal is communal and orally transmitted while still qualifying as a religious or courtly genre.\n\nIn many parts of Africa the use of music is not limited to entertainment: it serves a purpose to the local community and helps in the conduct of daily routines. Traditional African music supplies appropriate music and dance for work and for religious ceremonies of birth, naming, rites of passage, marriage and funerals. The beats and sounds of the drum are used in communication as well as in cultural expression.\n\nAfrican dances are largely participatory: there are traditionally no barriers between dancers and onlookers except with regard to spiritual, religious and initiation dances. Even ritual dances often have a time when spectators participate. Dances help people work, mature, praise or criticize members of the community, celebrate festivals and funerals, compete, recite history, proverbs and poetry and encounter gods. They inculcate social patterns and values. Many dances are performed by only males or females. Dances are often segregated by gender, reinforcing gender roles in children. Community structures such as kinship, age, and status are also often reinforced. To share rhythm is to form a group consciousness, to entrain with one another, to be part of the collective rhythm of life to which all are invited to contribute.\n\nYoruba dancers and drummers, for instance, express communal desires, values, and collective creativity. The drumming represents an underlying linguistic text that guides the dancing performance, allowing linguistic meaning to be expressed non-verbally. The spontaneity of these performances should not be confused with an improvisation that emphasizes the individual ego. The drummer's primary duty is to preserve the community. Master dancers and drummers are particular about the learning of the dance exactly as taught. Children must learn the dance exactly as taught without variation. Improvisation or a new variation comes only after mastering the dance, performing, and receiving the appreciation of spectators and the sanction of village elders.\n\nThe music of the Luo, for another example, is functional, used for ceremonial, religious, political or incidental purposes, during funerals (Tero buru) to praise the departed, to console the bereaved, to keep people awake at night, to express pain and agony and during cleansing and chasing away of spirits, during beer parties (Dudu, ohangla dance), welcoming back the warriors from a war, during a wrestling match (Ramogi), during courtship, in rain making and during divination and healing. Work songs are performed both during communal work like building, weeding, etc. and individual work like pounding of cereals, winnowing.\n\nAlan P. Merriam divided Africa into seven regions for ethnomusicological purposes, observing current political frontiers \"(see map)\", and this article follows this division as far as possible in surveying the music of ethnic groups in Africa.\n\n\n\nSudan takes its name from that of the sub-Saharan savanna which makes, with the Nile, a great cross-roads of the region. South of the Sahara the \"Sahel\" forms a bio-geographic zone of transition between the desert and the Sudanian Savannas, stretching between the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea. The Nilotic peoples prominent in southern Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and northern Tanzania, include the Luo, Dinka, Nuer and Maasai. Many of these have been included in the Eastern region.\n\n\nThe Senegambian Fula have migrated as far as Sudan at various times, often speaking Arabic as well as their own language. The Hausa people, who speak a language related to Ancient Egyptian and Biblical Hebrew, have moved in the opposite direction. Further west the Berber music of the Tuareg has penetrated to Sub-Saharan countries. These are included in the Western region, but the music of Sub-Saharan herders and nomads is heard from west to east.\n\nThese remaining four regions are most associated with Sub-Saharan African music: familiar African musical elements such as the use of cross-beat and vocal harmony may be found all over all four regions, as may be some instruments such as the iron bell. This is largely due to the expansion of the Niger–Congo-speaking people that began around 1500 BC: the last phases of expansion were 0–1000 AD. Only a few scattered languages in this great area cannot readily be associated with the Niger–Congo language family. However two significant non-Bantu musical traditions, the Pygmy music of the Congo jungle and that of the bushmen of the Kalahari, do much to define the music of the central region and of the southern region respectively.\n\nThe music of West Africa must be considered under two main headings: in its northernmost and westernmost parts, many of the above-mentioned transnational sub-Saharan ethnic influences are found among the Hausa, the Fulani, the Wolof people, the Mande speakers of Mali, Senegal and Mauritania, the Gur-speaking peoples of Mali, Burkina Faso and the northern halves of Ghana, Togo and Cote d'Ivoire, the Fula found throughout West Africa, and the Senufo speakers of Côte d'Ivoire and Mali.\n\nThe coastal regions are home to the Niger-Congo speakers; Kwa, Akan, the Gbe languages, spoken in Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Nigeria, of which Ewe is best known, the Yoruba and Igbo languages, spoken in Nigeria and the Benue–Congo languages of the east.\n\nInland and coastal languages are only distantly related. While the north, with its \"griot\" traditions, makes great use of stringed instruments and xylophones, the south relies much more upon drum sets and communal singing.\n\nComplex societies existed in the region from about 1500 BCE. The Ghana Empire existed from before c. 830 until c. 1235 in what is now south-east Mauritania and western Mali. The Sosso people had their capital at Koumbi Saleh until Sundiata Keita defeated them at the Battle of Kirina (c. 1240) and began the Mali Empire, which spread its influence along the Niger River through numerous vassal kingdoms and provinces. The Gao Empire at the eastern Niger bend was powerful in the ninth century CE but later subordinated to Mali until its decline. In 1340 the Songhai people made Gao the capital of a new Songhai Empire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe music of Cape Verde has long been influenced by Europe, Instrumentation includes the accordion (\"gaita\"), the bowed \"rabeca\", the \"violão\" guitar and the \"viola\" twelve string guitar as well as \"cavaquinho\", \"cimboa\" and \"ferrinho\". Styles include \"batuque, coladera, funaná, morna\" and \"tabanca\".\n\nThe central region of African music is defined by the tropical rain-forests at the heart of the continent. However Chad, the northernmost state, has a considerable subtropical and desert northern region.\n\nThe north of this region has Nilo-Saharans such as the Zande people. Early kingdoms were founded near Lake Chad: the Kanem Empire, ca. 600 BCE – 1380 CE encompassed much of Chad, Fezzan, east Niger and north-east Nigeria, perhaps founded by the nomadic Zaghawa, then ruled by the Sayfawa Dynasty. The Bornu Empire (1396–1893) was a continuation, the Kanembu founding a new state at Ngazargamu. These spoke the Kanuri languages spoken by some four million people in Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon, Libya and Sudan. They are noted for lute and drum music. The Kingdom of Baguirmi (1522–1897) and the Ouaddai Empire (1635–1912) were also centred near Lake Chad.\n\n\n\n\nThe East African musicological region, which includes the islands of the Indian Ocean, Madagascar, Réunion, Mauritius, Comor and the Seychelles, has been open to the influence of Arabian and Iranian music since the Shirazi Era. In the south of the region Swahili culture has adopted instruments such as the \"dumbek, oud\" and \"qanun\" – even the Indian tabla drums. The \"kabosy\", also called the \"mandoliny\", a small guitar of Madagascar, like the Comorian \"gabusi\", may take its name from the Arabian \"qanbūs\". \"Taarab\", a modern genre popular in Tanzania and Kenya, is said to take both its name and its style from Egyptian music as formerly cultivated in Zanzibar. Latterly there have been European influences also: the guitar is popular in Kenya, the contredanse, mazurka and polka are danced in the Seychelles.\n\n\nDrums (\"ngoma\", \"ng'oma\" or \"ingoma\") are much used: particularly large ones have been developed among the court musicians of East African kings. The term \"ngoma\" is applied to rhythm and dance styles as well as the drums themselves. as among the East Kenyan Akamba, the Buganda of Uganda, and the Ngoni people of Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia, who trace their origins to the Zulu people of kwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. The term is also used by the Tutsi/Watusi and Hutu/Bahutu. Bantu style drums, especially the sukuti drums, are played by the Luhya people\n(also known as \"Avaluhya\", \"Abaluhya\" or Luyia), a Bantu people of Kenya, being about 16% of Kenya's total population of 38.5 million, and in Uganda and Tanzania. They number about 6.1 million people. Abaluhya litungo.\n\n\n\n\nThe Southern Bantu languages include all of the important Bantu languages of South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana, and several of southern Mozambique. They have several sub-groups;\n\n\n\nGerewol. Dan people masked dance. Yoruba gelede. Hausa asauwara\nEwe dances: agbadza – Gadzo. Mande include the Mandinka, Maninka and Bamana Dances: bansango – didadi – dimba – sogominkum. Dagomba dance: takai – damba – jera – simpa – bamaya – tora – geena. São Tomé and Principe dance: danço-Congo – puíta – ússua. Cape Verde Dance = batuque – coladera – funaná – morna – tabanca. Kasena Dances: jongo – nagila – pe zara – war dance.

{"id": "7682447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7682447", "title": "The Burial of the Count of Orgaz", "text": "The Burial of the Count of Orgaz\n\nThe Burial of the Count of Orgaz (Spanish: El Entierro del Conde de Orgaz) is a 1586 painting by El Greco, a prominent Renaissance painter, sculptor, and architect of Greek origin. Widely considered among his finest works, it illustrates a popular local legend of his time. An exceptionally large painting, it is divided into two sections, heavenly above and terrestrial below, but it gives little impression of duality, since the upper and lower sections are brought together compositionally.\n\nThe painting has been lauded by art scholars, characterized, \"inter alia\", as \"one of the most truthful pages in the history of Spain\", as a masterpiece of Western Art and of late Mannerism, and as the epitome of Greco's artistic style.\n\nThe theme of the painting is inspired from a legend of the beginning of the 14th century. In 1312, a certain Don Gonzalo Ruiz, native of Toledo, and Señor of the town of Orgaz, died (his family later received the title of Count, by which he is generally and posthumously known). Don Gonzalo Ruiz was a descendant of the noble Palaiologos family, which produced the last ruling dynasty of the Byzantine Empire. A pious Caballero, the Count of Orgaz was also a philanthropist, who, among other charitable acts, left a sum of money for the enlargement and adornment of the church of Santo Tomé (El Greco's parish church), where he wanted to be buried.\n\nAccording to the legend, at the time the Count was buried, Saint Stephen and Saint Augustine descended in person from the heavens and buried him by their own hands in front of the dazzled eyes of those present. The event is depicted in the painting, with every detail of the work's subject described in the contract signed between Greco and the Church. The miracle is also mentioned in the Latin epitaphian inscription, set into the wall below the painting. Although Greco abided by the terms of the contract, he introduced some elements which \"modernized\" the legend, such as a series of features attributed to a 16th century customary funeral procession, the vestments of the two saints, as well as the depiction of eminent Toledan figures of his time. The \"modernization\" of the legend serves the didactic purpose of the painting, which, in accord with the Counter-Reformation doctrines, stresses the importance of both the worship of saints and of good deeds for the salvation of the soul.\n\nThe painting was commissioned by Andrés Núñez, the parish priest of Santo Tomé, for the side-chapel of the Virgin of the church of Santo Tomé. Núñez, who had initiated a project to refurbish the Count's burial chapel, is portrayed in the painting reading (on the right of the lower part of the composition). The painting's commission was the last step in the priest's plan to glorify the parish.\n\nSigned on 18 March 1586, the contract between Núñez and El Greco laid down specific iconographic demands, stipulated that the artist would pay for the materials, and provided for the delivery of the work until Christmas 1587. Greco must have worked at a frantic pace, and finished the painting between late 1587 and the spring of 1588. A long debate between the priests and the painter followed in relation to the value of the latter's work, for which the contract stipulated that it would be determined by appraisal. Initially intransigent, Greco eventually compromised and settled for the lower first \"expert estimate\", agreeing to receive 13,200 reales.\n\nAlready in 1588, people were flocking to Orgaz to see the painting. This immediate popular reception was mainly due to the realistic portrayal of the notable men of Toledo of the time. It was the custom for the eminent and noble men of the town to assist the burial of the noble-born, and it was stipulated in the contract that the scene should be represented in this manner.\n\nEl Greco would pay homage to the aristocracy of the spirit, the clergy, the jurists, the poets and the scholars, who honored him and his art with their esteem, by immortalizing them in the painting. \"The Burial of the Count of Orgaz\" has been admired not only for its art, but also because it is a gallery of portraits of some of the most important personalities of that time in Toledo. In 1612, Francisco de Pisa wrote: \"The people of our city never grow tired, because [...] there are realistic portraits of many notable men of our times.\"\n\nAccording to the terms stipulated in the contract and the prevailing scholarly approach, the painting is divided into two zones, juxtaposing the earthly with the heavenly world, which are brought together compositionally (e.g., by the standing figures, by their varied participation in the earthly and heavenly event, by the torches, cross etc.). Franz Philipp emphasizes on the element of the assumption of the soul (\"assumptio animae\"), and argues that the work should be considered as tripartite: the central division of the painting is occupied by the \"assumptio animae\", in the form of a newborn, \"ethereal\" baby. Augustine's perception of the soul and its ascent, which evolved from a Neoplatonic basis, is a possible inspiration for the painter's imagery of \"assumptio animae\". Greco's way of thematically and artistically linking the upper with the lower zone of the painting has been characterized by art scholars as ingenuous, and as further accomplishing the main message of the painting, that veneration and good works lead to salvation.\n\nIn the upper part, the heavenly one, the clouds have parted to receive the \"righteous man\" in Paradise. Heaven is evoked by swirling icy clouds, semiabstract in their shape, and the saints are tall and phantomlike. Christ, clad in white and in glory, is a radiance of light, and the crowning point of the triangle formed by the figures of the Madonna and Saint John the Baptist in the traditional Orthodox composition of the Deesis. These three central figures of heavenly glory are surrounded by apostles, martyrs, Biblical figures (including Moses, Noah and David) as well as Philip II of Spain, though he was still alive. The \"righteous\" Philip II is spiritually united with Christ and the heavenly creatures in a City of God as conceived by Augustine. In the central part of the composition, an angel powerfully pushes the nascent soul upwards, a movement interpreted once again as a visualization of the Counter-Reformation teaching of salvation.\n\nThe scene of the miracle is depicted in the lower part of the composition, in the terrestrial section, where all is normal as regards the scale and proportions of the figures. Saint Augustine, bearing the characteristics of Gaspar de Quiroga y Vela, the Archbishop of Toledo, and Saint Stephen, in golden and red vestments respectively, bend reverently over the body of the count, who is clad in magnificent armor that reflects the yellow and reds of the other figures. The armor is contemporary with Greco's time, and inspired by the ceremonial military dress of the Spanish royals as depicted in Titian's portraits. The noblemen contemplate the event in a detached and restrained manner. Their subdued composure has been interpreted either as another visual element of the didactic purpose of the painting under the Counter-Reformation influence or as an expression of the Byzantine origins of Greco's art. The young boy at the left is El Greco's son, Jorge Manuel; on a handkerchief in his pocket is inscribed the artist's signature and the date 1578, the year of the boy's birth. Jorge Manuel's inclusion emphasizes the didactic purpose of the painting: the boy occupies a prominent position close to the spectator's view, directing the latter with his pointing finger. The artist himself can be recognised directly above the raised hand of a knight of the Order of Santiago.\n\nThe painting has a chromatic harmony that is incredibly rich, expressive and radiant. On the black mourning garments of the nobles are projected the gold-embroidered vestments, thus creating an intense ceremonial character. In the heavenly space there is a predominance of transparent harmonies of iridescence and ivoried greys, which harmonize with the gilded ochres, while in the Madonna's maforium (mantle) deep blue is closely combined with bright red. The rhetoric of the expressions, the glances and the gestural translation make the scene very moving.\n\nThe composition of the painting has been closely related to the Byzantine iconography of the Dormition of the Mother of God. The argumentation supporting this point of view focuses on the icon of the \"Dormition\" by El Greco that was discovered in 1983 in the church of the same name in Syros. Robert Byron, according to whom the iconographic type of the \"Dormition\" was the compositional model for \"The Burial of the Count of Orgaz\", asserts that El Greco as a genuine Byzantine painter worked throughout his life with a repertoire of components and motifs at will, depending on the narrative and expressive requirements of the art.\n\nOn the other hand, Harold Wethey rejects as \"unconvincing\" the view that the composition of the \"Burial\" is derived from the \"Dormition\", \"since the work is more immediately related to Italian Renaissance prototypes\". In connection with its elimination of spatial depth by compressing figures into the foreground, the early Florentine Mannerists—Rosso Fiorentino, Pontormo and Parmigianino—are mentioned, as well two paintings by Tintoretto: the \"Crucifixion\" and the \"Resurrection of Lazarus\", the latter because of the horizontal row of spectators behind the miracle. The elliptical grouping of the two saints, as they lower the dead body, is said to be closer to Titian's early \"Entombment\" than to any other work. Wethey asserts that \"El Greco's Mannerist method of composition is nowhere more clearly expressed than here, where all of the action takes place in the frontal plane\".\n\nPhilipp argues that the painting is heavily influenced by the contemporary Spanish funerary art, and that Greco adhered to this sepulchrar artistic tradition while adapting a popular religious subject, the Entombment of Christ, to the needs of his assignment. Sarah Schroth believes that Titian's \"Entombment\" is used by Greco as a model to subtly pass his didactic message for the value of good works, and she mentions Albrecht Dürer's \"Adoration of the Trinity\" as an inspiration for the painting's bi-partite composition and the depiction of contemporary laymen in the lower, earthly zone. However, Scroth departs from Wethey's absolute rejection of the presence of Byzantine elements in the painting, and accepts \"Dormition\" as an influence for the \"Burial\" 's depiction of the \"assumptio animae\". A third work of Tintoretto, \"The Last Judgment\", is mentioned by Schroth as a possible influence for the \"Burial\" 's depiction of Gloria, since Greco wanted to incorporate elements of the funeral liturgy in the upper part of the painting.\n\nRegardless of their different approaches in relation to the painting's influences, the \"Burial\" is unanimously celebrated by art scholars as a masterpiece. It is also regarded as the first completely personal work of the artist, the culmination of his first ten years of creativity in Toledo, initiating his mature artistic period, as well as the processes of spiritualization and dematerialization, which will continue in his later works. According to Lambraki-Plaka, the \"Burial\" is a landmark in the artist's career: \"This is where El Greco sets before us, in a highly compressed form the wisdom he has brought to his art, his knowledge, his expertise, his composite imagination and his expressive power. It is the living encyclopedia of his art without ceasing to be a masterpiece with organic continuity and entelechy\".\n\nThe impressive depiction of prominent members of the Toledan society in the lower zone establishes Greco as an accomplished portraitist, with a profound knowledge of physiognomy and gestures. The chromatic harmony and the use of incredibly rich, expressive and radiant colors confirm his talent as a colorist, while the scenes depicted on the embroidered vestments reveal a gifted miniaturist. The overall composition with the innovative elements already mentioned—the peculiar synthesis of the real with the surreal, the negation of spacial depth and the impressive array of portraits—unveil all aspects of Greco's extraordinary art. Interpreting the remark of Francisco de Pisa in relation to the painting, that \"there are always new things to contemplate in it\", Schroth characterizes the \"Burial\" as an \"inexhaustible source of instruction as well as pleasure\".\n\nIn his travel diaries of the Far East, Palestine and Spain, Albert Einstein characterizes \"Burial\" as \"a magnificent painting\" and \"among the profoundest images I have ever seen.\"\n\n\n"}

The episode serves as the \"WB Finale\" of the series, as it moved to the UPN channel for the remainder of the series.\n\nThe premise of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" is that an adolescent girl, Buffy Summers, is chosen by mystical forces and given superhuman powers to kill vampires, demons, and other evil creatures in the fictional town of Sunnydale. She is supported by a close circle of family and friends, nicknamed the Scooby Gang. In \"The Gift\", Buffy refuses to accept that her sister Dawn's death is the only way to defeat the hell-god Glory and prepares to do battle. In the end, she discovers the meaning of her \"gift\".\n\nThe Scooby Gang considers plans to foil Glory, but can only suggest killing Buffy's sister Dawn before Glory uses her in the ritual, which Buffy refuses to consider. Anya suggests using the Dagon Sphere, which repels and confuses Glory, and the hammer of Olaf the troll. They hope to delay Glory until her deadline for completing the ritual has passed, preventing an apocalypse and making Dawn useless to her.\n\nAs Buffy trains with Giles, she reveals to him that the First Slayer told her, on her vision quest (in \"Intervention\"), that death was her gift, an idea she rejects. Buffy also notes that while she survived killing Angel despite loving him, losing Dawn will destroy her. Xander proposes to Anya.\n\nBuffy and Spike gather weapons. She asks him to protect Dawn. Spike tells Buffy he knows she'll never love him, but is grateful that she treats him like a man rather than a monster. Glory's minions build a tower for the ritual to open the gates between dimensions.\n\nBuffy and her allies confront Glory just as the ritual is to begin. Willow launches a magic attack, confusing and dazing Glory, while restoring Tara's sanity. Buffy attacks Glory with the Dagon sphere, but Glory manages to destroy it. As they fight Glory punches off her head, revealing she is actually fighting Buffy's robot double. Buffy surprises Glory by attacking her with Olaf's Hammer, and then races to save Dawn, but Glory slows her down as they battle on the tower. The two of them fall to the ground below and Xander uses a crane to hit Glory with a wrecking ball. Buffy beats Glory with the hammer until she reverts to Ben, but spares his life, telling him that Glory must never return or they will both die. With the others' attention diverted, Giles kills Ben by suffocating him, to prevent Glory's re-emergence.\n\nWith the window of time to stop the ritual about to close, the Scoobies spot someone up on the scaffolding with Dawn. Willow telepathically tells Spike to go up to Dawn, and she and Tara magically clear a path for him by throwing aside Glory's minions and guards. Spike finds Doc the demon threatening to start the ritual. A fight ensues, but Doc tosses Spike off the scaffolding and then cuts into Dawn with shallow cuts, starting the apocalyptic ritual. Buffy reaches the top, kills Doc and frees the captive Dawn just as the portal between dimensions opens. Dawn is willing to sacrifice herself to seal the portal, but Buffy, realizing the true meaning of the First Slayer's revelation, stops her. Buffy throws herself into the portal, which closes when she dies. She is buried with the epitaph, \"She saved the world. A lot.\"\n\nIn an essay on the ownership of evil, Erma Petrova argues that Giles murdering Ben is comparable to Willow murdering Warren (in \"Villains\")- both victims are human, and their deaths are necessary to prevent further suffering. Although the moral ambiguity of killing Ben is discussed earlier in the episode, as well as Ben's innocence (\"I know he's an innocent, but...not like 'Dawn' innocent\"), Giles is never shown to have feelings of guilt afterwards; he did what needed to be done. Contrast this with Willow's guilt over murdering Warren in a spirit of revenge, a theme that persists until the end of the series. Petrova feels the difference for Giles is that killing Ben is his only option - the police wouldn't understand the danger, Buffy is morally unable to take a human life, and leaving him alive presents too great a risk. Willow, however, had other options available and yet chose to murder Warren anyway.\n\nGiles recognizes that Buffy, as a hero, lives by a more demanding moral code than most people. Her unique role and abilities confer special responsibilities, including moral rules by which Giles is not bound. When Ben marvels, \"She could have killed me\", Giles disagrees: \"No she couldn’t. Never... She’s a hero, you see. She’s not like us.\" However, in an essay on the ethics in this episode, C. W. Marshall claims that Giles actually exhibits heroism, as his murder of Ben serves a greater good and protects those he loves.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has not been published in English.\n\n\"The Knight of Hope\" salutes the heroism of Prestes. In 1924 he set out on a 25,000 kilometer march that became known as the Prestes Column. In 1935 he founded the National Liberation Alliance and led the so-called \"Communist Conspiracy\". He was imprisoned in 1936 by the Getúlio Vargas dictatorship, along with his pregnant wife. The book expresses considerable support for Prestes's positions and indeed admiration for his person. As Amado observed, the book was written “with passion, about someone who is loved”. However, one critic has argued that Amado’s estimate of the significance of Prestes is somewhat exaggerated, while admitting that the biography \"is useful testimony to the relation between art and political life\". \n\nAmado himself suffered censorship and political persecution under Brazil’s Estado Novo regime (1937-45). He was imprisoned in both 1936 and 1937, accused of being a Communist and a subversive. In 1937, copies of his various works were burned in a public square in Salvador along with those of others. He decided to write Prestes’ biography in 1941 to campaign for the release of the revolutionary leader, who was still in prison. The book was written in Buenos Aires and published in Spanish in Argentina in 1942. Copies were only available on the black market in Brazil, and the text circulated in secret. The Argentine edition was later banned. \n\nThe first Brazilian edition was published in 1945, but disappeared from bookstores after the military coup of 1964. The next edition was not published until 1979. Throughout the biography Jorge Amado addresses an imaginary female reader, showing his intention to speak directly to the Brazilian people, encouraging them to support democracy and liberty. \n"}
