{"id": "37945836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37945836", "title": "Architecture of Scotland in the Prehistoric era", "text": "Architecture of Scotland in the Prehistoric era\n\nThe architecture of Scotland in the prehistoric era includes all human building within the modern borders of Scotland, before the arrival of the Romans in Britain in the first century BCE. Stone Age settlers began to build in wood in what is now Scotland from at least 8,000 years ago. The first permanent houses of stone were constructed around 6,000 years ago, as at Knap of Howar, Orkney and settlements like Skara Brae. There are also large numbers of chambered tombs and cairns from this era, particularly in the west and north. In the south and east there are earthen barrows, often linked to timber monuments of which only remnants remain. Related structures include bank barrows, cursus monuments, mortuary enclosures and timber halls. From the Bronze Age there are fewer new buildings, but there is evidence of crannogs, roundhouses built on an artificial islands and of Clava cairns and the first hillforts. From the Iron Age there is evidence of substantial stone Atlantic roundhouses, which include broch towers, smaller duns. There is also evidence of about 1,000 hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line.\n\nThe oldest house for which there is evidence in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE. The earliest stone structures are probably the three hearths found at Jura, dated to about 6000 BCE. With the development of agriculture, groups of settlers began building stone houses on what is now Scottish soil in the Neolithic era, around 6,000 years ago, and the first villages around 500 years later. Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the Northern and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney is one of the oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction, it was probably occupied for 900 years, between 3700 and 2800 BCE. Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney also dates from this era, occupied from about 3100 to 2500 BCE and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village.\n\nThere are also large numbers of chambered tombs and cairns from this period. Many different types have been identified, but they can be roughly grouped into passage graves, gallery graves and stone cists. Cists are relatively simple box-like graves, usually made up of stone slaps and covered with a large stone or slab. Maes Howe, near Stenness on the mainland of Orkney (dated 3400–3200 BCE) and Monamore, Isle of Arran (dated approximately 3500 BCE) are passage graves, of megalith construction, built with large stones, many of which weigh several tons. Gallery graves are rectangular gallery-like spaces, where the entrance at one end is the width of the gallery. These were sometimes lined or roofed with slabs and then covered with earth. Among the most impressive surviving monuments of the period are the first sets of standing stones in Scotland, such as those at Stenness on the mainland of Orkney, which date from about 3100 BCE, of four stones, the tallest of which is in height.\nIn contrast to the Highlands and Islands where stone was extensively used, in the south and east the most visible architectural survivals of the Neolithic are mainly earthen barrows, the earliest probably dating from the beginning of the fourth millennium BCE. Today these monuments consist of massive mounds of earth or stone, most commonly trapezoidal in plan and often orientated to the east. They are widely distributed in the Lowlands, particularly in Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders. Related structures include bank barrows, cursus monuments, mortuary enclosures, timber halls, and other forms of enclosure. Bank barrows are parallel-sided mounds, usually flanked by ditches on either side. Originally believed to be Roman in origin, cursus monuments also consist of long parallel lengths of banks of earth with external ditches, but with an open avenue or enclose between. Both forms are usually associated with burial chambers. Examples of bank barrows in Scotland include from Perthshire the long mound at Auchenlaich and the hybrid bank barrow/cursus monument and at Cleaven Dyke, which stretches for over . Mortuary enclosures are usually sub-rectangular banks with external ditches and raised platforms of stone or wood within them, thought by J. G. Scott to be used for the exposure of corpses prior to burial elsewhere, although this interpretation is disputed. Remains of mortuary enclosures of this period are often found under long barrows. Key examples include Pitnacree, Perthshire and two closely related sites at Lochhill and Slewcairn, both in Kirkcudbright. The timber halls are probably unique to Scotland and were massive roofed buildings made of oak, all of which seem to have been subsequently burnt down. There is debate as to the role of these buildings, which have been seen variously as regular farming homesteads of Neolithic families and as related to a series of monumental constructions such as barrows. The hall at Balbridie, Aberdeenshire was long, wide and may have had a roof high, making it large enough to accommodate up to 50 people.\nAs bronze working developed from about 2000 BCE, there was a decline in the building of large new structures, which, with a reduction of the total area under cultivation, suggests a fall in population. From the Early and Middle Bronze Age there is evidence of cellular round houses of stone, as at Jarlshof and Sumburgh on Shetland. At Jarlshof these are oval houses with thick stone walls, which may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation. There is also evidence of the occupation of crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on an artificial islands, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters. They were often constructed of layers of brushwood and rubble. Sometimes they were revetted around the edges with vertical piles and sometimes surfaced with logs of oak.\n\nThe creation of cairns and Megalithic monuments continued into this period. There are approximately fifty Clava cairns in Scotland, named after those at Balnuaran of Clava near Inverness. They take two distinct forms, either a circular rubble enclosure known as \"ring cairns\", or passage graves, with a long entrance, usually in complex astronomical alignments. As elsewhere in Europe, hill forts were first introduced in this period, including the occupation of Eildon hill near Melrose in the Scottish Borders, from around 1000 BCE, which accommodated several hundred houses on a fortified hilltop, and Traprain Law in East Lothian, which had a 20-acre enclosure, sectioned in two places west of the summit, made up of a coursed, stone wall with a rubble core.\n\nIn the early Iron Age, from the seventh century BCE, cellular houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple Atlantic roundhouses, substantial circular buildings with a drystone construction. Important examples are at Quanterness, Bu, Pierowall, and Tofts Ness on Orkney, and at Clickhimin on Shetland. From about 400 BC more complex Atlantic roundhouses began to be built, as at Howe, Orkney and Crosskirk, Caithness.\n\nThe most massive constructions that date from this era are the circular broch towers, probably dating from about 200 BCE. They are drystone hollow-walled structures that are unique to Scotland. Most ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed in height. There are at least 100 broch sites in Scotland, of which the best preserved include those at South Yarrows near Wick, Midhowe Broch on Orkney and the Broch of Clickimin and the Broch of Mousa in Shetland. Despite extensive research, their purpose and the nature of the societies that created them are still a matter of debate.\n\nArchaeologists since the 1960s have distinguished brochs from smaller structures of similar construction, usually called duns. The heaviest evidence of the occupation of crannogs was in this era, but they would continue to be used until the Middle Ages. This period also saw the beginnings of wheelhouses, a roundhouse with a characteristic outer wall, within which was a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel), but these would flourish most in the era of Roman occupation. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure. Most are relatively small, covering one or two acres, but some are much larger as at Castle O'er, Birrenwark, Cadimuir, Cadroner and White Meldon. They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure.\n\n"}
{"id": "36202623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36202623", "title": "Argentine nationalism", "text": "Argentine nationalism\n\nArgentine nationalism refers to the nationalism of Argentine people and Argentine culture. It surged during the War of Independence and the Civil Wars, and strengthened during the 1880s. \n\nThere were waves of renewed interest in nationalism in response to World War II, the National Reorganization Process and the December 2001 riots.\n\nModern Argentina was once part of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, part of the Spanish Empire. The capture of the Spanish king during the Peninsular War began the Argentine War of Independence. It was based on the principle of the retroversion of the sovereignty to the people: with the king absent, the sovereignty returned to its subjects who were then capable to rule themselves. \n\nThis led to conflicts among the provinces of the viceroyalty: some factions wanted to maintain the country under the centralist organization used so far, others wanted to use a federalist system, and others wanted to secede their provinces as independent countries. This led to the Argentine Civil Wars. The Supreme Directors of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata were centralists, and José de San Martín and José Gervasio Artigas were federalists. Those groups evolved into the Unitarian Party and the Federal Party respectively.\n\nThe sense of national unity was increased during the French and Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata. Britain and France sought to weaken Juan Manuel de Rosas with a naval blockade, but the resistance against foreign powers gave him great popularity and fostered national unity.\n\nIn the 1880s Argentina seized Patagonia with the Conquest of the Desert, and secured its modern national limits. It was feared that the great European immigration wave to Argentina would dilute national identity, so Vicente Quesada and other historians promoted nationalism by establishing the idea of the viceroyalty as the \"Grand Argentina\", broke into several countries by the meddling of Britain, France and the Empire of Brazil. This perception was reinforced by the diplomatic conflicts with Brazil of the time.\n\nNationalism resurfaced during the 1930s. Opposed to Alvear's turnaround, in 1935, young Yrigoyenistas from a nationalist background founded FORJA (Fuerza Orientadora Radical de la Juventud Argentina, Radical Orienting Force of Argentine Youth), which had as leaders the Socialist Arturo Jauretche, Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz and Gabriel del Mazo. FORJA's motto was: \"We are a colonial Argentina, we want to be a free Argentina.\" [10] Among other things, FORJA denounced the silence of the government on many problems such as the creation of the Central Bank, \"economic sacrifices imposed in benefices of foreign capitalism\", \"petroleum politics\", \"arbitrary military interventions\", \"restrictions to freedom of opinion\", \"incorporation to the League of Nations\", \"suppression of relations with Russia\", \"parliamentary investigations\", \"the Senate crime\", etc and specially during World War II. Those nationalists thought that Argentina had an economic dependence of Britain, and that the country should not help Britain in the conflict but stay neutral. This nationalism led to the Revolution of '43, and during it to the emergence of Juan Domingo Perón. Perón reported the meddling of the ambassador of the United States Spruille Braden in the 1946 election, and won by a landslide. He nationalized several key tools of the economy of Argentina, and declared Argentine economic independence.\n\nThe analogies between Perón and Rosas became explicit during the \"Revolución Libertadora\", a coup that ousted Perón from power and banned Peronism. Eduardo Lonardi, \"de facto\" president, used the quote \"ni vencedores ni vencidos\" (), which was used by Justo José de Urquiza after deposing Rosas in the battle of Caseros. The official perspective was that Perón was \"the second tyranny\", the first one being Rosas, and that both ones should be equally rejected, and conversely both governments that ousted them should be praised. For this end they draw the line of historical continuity \"May – Caseros – Libertadora\", matching the coup with the May Revolution and the defeat of Rosas. This approach backfired. Perón was highly popular and the military coup unpopular; so Peronists embraced the comparison established between Rosas and Perón, but viewing him with a positive light instead. Nationalist historians draw then their own line of historical continuity, \"San Martín – Rosas – Perón\".\n\nThe National Reorganization Process promoted nationalist values during the Dirty War and the Falklands War. Both conflicts generated huge controversy. Nationalism declined in the following years as a result, increasing Americanization during the 1990s. Nationalism resurfaced again after the December 2001 riots in Argentina.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8088125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8088125", "title": "Basque rural sports", "text": "Basque rural sports\n\nBasque rural sports, known as \"Deportes Rurales\" in Spanish or \"Herri Kirolak\" in Basque, is the term used for a number of sports competitions rooted in the traditional lifestyles of the Basque people. The term \"force basque\" is used in French.\n\nVirtually all regional Basque rural sports have their origin in the two main historical occupations, the or \"baserritarra\" (farmer) and \"arrantzalea\" (fisher), with a larger percentage hailing from the rural background. The sociological changes in the Basque Country have led many of these becoming technically obsolete in the 19th and 20th century. Few continue to exist as rural or marine activities connected to everyday life and have become rare but many have managed to transform themselves into popular sports instead, some of which have become extremely popular.\n\nWinners receive a Basque beret (\"boina\" or \"txapela\") as a trophy, hence the Basque word for \"champion\" - \"txapeldun\", literally \"one who has a beret\".\n\nBetting, both by the competitors and the audience, is very common and popular at such sporting events in the north of Spain.\n\nIn 2006 the Basque Government identified 18 particular rural sports, called \"H18K\", in its Strategic Plan for promotion. These 18 categories are (in alphabetical order):\n\nLiterally \"axe test\", this rural sport more commonly known as aizkolaritza, from the Basque word for a wood-cutter. This is a very popular sport today but its origins are to be found in the rural wood cutting and charcoal burning communities of earlier periods.\n\nIn this competition, the wood cutter has to chop through a number of tree trunks arranged on the ground in rows as quickly as possible while standing on the log to beat his competitors.\n\nThis sport is often seen in summer at local festivities and open-air dances, held in towns all over the country.\n\nThis sport translates as \"Human-animal tests\" and is a collective term for a number of sports in which humans and animals are involved in dragging heavy weights. There are four main categories:\nThese normally take place on specially built trial grounds. The aim is to cover a certain distance within a given time or to cover as many circuits as possible. The \"idi probak\" are by far the most popular in this category.\n\nThe lifting of stones is one of the most widely known Basque rural sport outside the Basque Country, largely thanks to the prowess of Iñaki Perurena, a \"harrijasotzaile\" (stone-lifter) from Leitza, in Navarre, the first on record to lift stone over 300 kg.\n\nThere are usually two stone-lifters competing in each event, taking turns in one or several attempts, to perform the greatest possible number of lifts. A lift is considered complete when the stone has been properly balanced on the shoulder.\n\nThe four types of stone most frequently used are rectangular, cylindrical, spherical and square and were established at the beginning of the 20th century. The stones are traditionally made of granite, their weight normally ranging from 100 kg to 212 kg.\n\nTogether with aizkolaritza (wood chopping), stone lifting is another example a widely performed rural sport at local festivities all over the Basque Country.\n\nThe \"hole drilling\" competition involves having to grind holes into a rock. Teams of three compete against each other. They take turns in using a long metal pole (called \"laztabin\") to punch and drill a hole into a large rock upon which they are standing, pouring water onto the working area while the third person gets to rest.\n\nThis tradition goes back to the quarrying activities around the Basque Country, in particular in Biscay. In Spanish it is called \"barrenadores\" \"drillers\" and occasionally \"barrenatzaileak\" (drillers, from the Spanish word) in Basque as well.\n\nThe \"lifting of anvils\" requires competitors to lift an iron anvil or \"ingude\" weighing 18 kg 30 cm above the height of their own head as many times as possible in a set time period. The anvil has the shape of an obtuse triangle with a stump at one point or an elongated T and is traditionally used in shoeing horses. Champions manage some 80 lifts in 2 minutes.\n\nIn Spanish this is called \"alzamiento de yunque\" and in French \"lever d'enclume\".\n\nLiterally \"hay bale lifting\", this sport involves raising a hay-bale with the aid of a pulley.\n\nThe competition is usually about lifting the bale as often as possible within a given period of time, most commonly 2 minutes. The bale weighs 45 kg in the men's competitions and 30 kg in the women's competition.\n\nThe most difficult part is to get the bale to the required height for the first time. Once that has been achieved, the competitors allow the bale to drop in free fall, grabbing the rope and jumping up at the appropriate moment to use their own body weight to lift the bale again when coming down. A lot of skill is needed to avoid rope burn. The visual appearance is not dissimilar to swinging on a church bell rope.\n\nIn Spanish this is called \"levantamiento de fardo\" and in French \"lever de paille\".\n\n\"Hay bale tossing\" is related to \"lasto altxatzea\". Here the hay-bales have to be thrown over a bar set a certain height with the help of a pitchfork. For men the height is normally 7m, for women 5m and the bale has to hit a bell for the toss to be valid.\n\nThis sport is very similar to the Scottish sheaf toss. In Spanish this is called \"lanzamiento de fardo\".\n\nIn \"cob gathering\" competitions, also called \"buskail biltzea\", cobs are placed at 1.25m distances in a line, 25 in a line at the most. The game can be played to 50, 75 or 100 cobs in which case they are placed in sets of 2, 3 or 4. The competitors have to collect these in order (the nearest first) and place them into a basket at one end of the row of cobs.\n\nIt is called \"recogida de mazorcas\" in Spanish and \"course des épis de maïs\" in French.\n\nThe \"churn carrying\" competition usually involves milk-cans and is very similar to the \"txinga eramatea\" competition. Competitors have to carry a 41 kg milk-churn in each hand as far as possible. This game is also called \"esneketariak\" \"milk carrying\" or \"ontziketariak\" \"can carrying\".\n\nThe \"oxcart game\" is a display of strength. Contestants have to lift the back of an ox cart weighing 360 kg 40 cm above ground. The cart is pivoted to the ground at the front end and competitors must rotate it, trying to go around as many times as possible.\n\nIt is also called \"andartza\" in Basque. In Spanish this is called \"levantamiento de carro\" and in French \"lever de charette\".\n\nLiterally \"scythe game\", this sport is also known as \"segalariak\" (scythers), \"sega proba\" (scythe test), \"sega apustua\" (scythe bet) or \"segalaritza\" (scything). The earliest record of this sport comes from a bertso dating back to 1880 about a competition in Iturriotz.\n\nIn this sport competitors (called \"segalari\") either compete to cut the most grass in a given period of time (usually one hour) or they are each given plots of grass of the same size and the competition is to see who can scythe theirs the fastest. Today the competition usually lasts one hour but two-hour competitions also are still held. At the end, the grass is raked, weighed and baled to establish the winner. Traditionally, as with most Basque sports, the competitors would make a profit by betting but monetary prizes have been put up since the 1950s.\n\nThere are few actual records in this sport as it very much depends on the terrain and is thus difficult to compare. But a number of \"segalari\" have achieved fame nonetheless, for example the legendary Pedro Maria Otaño Ezeitza, commonly known as \"Santa Ageda\" from Beizama who was also an aizkolari and competed up until 1915. Another famed event was the competition of 1925 in Iturriotz when, before a crowd of 6000, Pedro Mendizabal from Aia and Jose Arrieta from Urnieta battled each other. Legend has it that more than 150,000 pesetas in bets were placed. Mendizabal won, cutting 4294 kg of grass in two hours against his rival's 3957 kg.\n\nThe use of scythes is still widespread today as many pastures are too steep for modern farm machinery so scythes are used to cut grass or bracken. Working scythes have blades between 0.9-0.95m long but competition scythes range from 1.18-1.24m in length. A decent \"segalari\" can manage some 5000m2 in a day.\n\nIn Spanish this is simply called \"siega\".\n\nTug-of-war is also traditional in the Basque Country. Usually two teams of eight compete, trying to drag the other team over a line by pulling on the rope.\n\nThere are free competitions in which the weight of the competitors is ignored and more structured events where there are weight categories of 525 kg, 560 kg, 640 kg and 720 kg per team. Juvenile teams are always under 560 kg. Three lines are marked on the ground, a middle line and parallel to that at 2m distance two more. The maximum length of the rope is 32m with a circumference between 10-12.5 cm. There are 5 markers on the rope, a red marker in the middle, 2m away from the red marker on either side are white markers and 5m on either side of those are blue markers. The aim is to get the opposing team's blue marker over your own 2m line. Hands must always be on the rope and you may not support it with any other part of your body or let it slacken. Only the last member of the team is allowed to wind the rope around their body.\n\nIn Spanish this is called \"sogatira\" and in French \"tir à la corde\".\n\n\"Sawing\" competitions, also called \"trontzalaritza\" or \"arpana\", are seen as a variation of \"aizkolaritza\" and involve sawing through pieces of wood. The log is either fixed horizontally on sawhorses at a height of 40 cm or at an angle with one end over the sawhorse and two members of the sawing team sitting on the lower end to stabilise the log, with two other handling the saw. The saw is usually 2 m long, the logs vary but can be over 1 m in circumference and usually between 10-20 in number.\n\nIn Spanish this is called \"corte de troncos con tronza\" or just \"tronza\" and in French \"scieur de bois\".\n\nIn the \"weight carrying competition\" weights have to be carried in both hands as far as possible. There usually is no time limit but the weights weigh between 50–100 kg each and may not be put down or supported by any other part of your body. Competitors may only hold them by the rope handles but are not allowed to put their hands through them. It is possible to bring your own, favourite weights but they are checked by judges beforehand. The aim is to complete as many \"plaza\" of 28m as possible. You set your own pace and may stop (without putting the weights down) and champions manage between 400-500m.\nIt is similar to the churn carrying competition.\n\nThe word \"eramatea\" variously shows up in dialect forms such as \"erutea\" or \"eroatea\". In Spanish this is called \"prueba de txingas\" or \"carreras marmitas\".\n\nThe \"sack carrying\", also called \"zaku lasterketa\" (sack race) requires participants to have both speed and stamina. It usually takes the form of a relay race in teams of 3 where the runners have to carry heavy sacks across their shoulders. Depending on the area, the sacks contain a variety of things from bread to beans and usually weigh 60 kg, 75 kg or 80 kg.\n\nIn Spanish this is called \"carreras de contrabandistas\" (\"smugglers' runs\") or \"carrera con saco\" and in French \"course de sac\".\n\nThe above categories included in the H18K group aside, there are a number of other rural and traditional Basque sports, some of which are extremely popular both in and outside the Basque Country. Some are indigenous, some also occur in areas adjacent to the Basque country or other cultures around the world.\n\n\"Ram fights\", also variously called \"ahari apustuak\" (ram bets) and \"ahari talka\" (ram bump) are very popular around the Urola basin in towns like Azpeitia (between October and June) and Arroa. They test the strength and endurance of the rams, using their natural inclination to fight other rams.\n\nThe rams are trained and fed on a variety of secret diets involving things like beans, apples, red wine, carrots or egg yolk. A basic fight goes over at least 8 \"ekintaldi\" (attacks), also called \"kintze\" (from Spanish \"quince\" \"15\"), with the best of 8 winning. To score a point, a ram has to land a square hit on his opponent's head or horns. If the ram runs away at the start, the owner is allowed to bring him back into the ring once. There are records of bets over 100 attacks but these are rare now.\n\nAlthough the strongest rams are said to come from the Aralar Mendilerroa mountain range between Gipuzkoa and Navarre, they are also said to be too placid so the preference is for rams from the region around Urbasa, Andia and Gorbeia.\n\nThe Basque Government controversially banned the Iurreta \"ahari topekas\" in 2007 on animal welfare grounds.\n\nThis sport is called \"peleas de carneros\" in Spanish.\n\nA game of throwing hoes.\n\nIn Spanish this is called \"lanzamiento de azada\", in French as \"lancer de houe\".\n\nThere are two variations of this game depending on whether it is played at a seaside town or inland. In a seaside town, a long rope is suspended between a pole on the quay and the mast of a boat. A dead goose (previously live geese were used too) is suspended head down in the middle of the rope. Teams now have to row out and a designated person must jump up, grab the goose, hang on to it and try to remove the head before falling off. At the same time, sailors at both ends of the rope try their best to shake the person clinging to the goose off. The team that collects the most heads wins. Inland, the rope is suspended over the ground and the same goal must be achieved from horseback.\n\nThe most famous of these is held in Lekeitio on \"Antzar Eguna\" (goose day), held between the 1–8 September goes back at least to the year 1877 when it was played only by sailors. It has also been celebrated on other days in other villages, sometimes (for example in Gernika) using chicken instead of geese.\n\nIn Spanish this is called \"juego de gansos\" and in French as \"jeu d'oie\".\n\nSheep shearing also features in Basque rural sports and works along similar lines as other sheep shearing contests. \"Ardi ile moztea\" translates as \"the shearing of sheep's wool\" and it is also known as \"ardi moztea\" \"sheep shearing\".\n\nSimilar to horse racing but with donkeys.\n\nShotgun shooting is particularly popular in the area around Eibar in the Basque Country.\n\nIn Spanish this is called \"puntería con escopeta\", in French as \"compétition avec escopette\".\n\nBasques have also their own variants of dirt-track and lawn bowls. There is a large number of variations of the game but most are similar to skittles and centre around a set of pins that must be knocked down with a ball.\n\nA game of throwing espadrilles, a kind of shoe with a straw sole.\n\nIn Spanish this is called \"lanzamiento de alpargata\", in French as \"lancer d'espadrille \".\n\nA very popular rowing competition all along the coast of the Bay of Biscay and the Northern coast of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThis sport hails back to the days when fishermen had to reach fishing grounds quickly and return to port as quickly as possible to achieve the best price.\n\nThe crew is made up of thirteen oarsmen and the cox, who faces them at the stern. The boats are called \"traineru\" (\"trainera\" in Spanish), and are derived from 19th century fishing boats.\n\nThe most important competition in the Bay of Biscay in summer takes place the first two Sundays in September: the Kontxako Bandera, where the best teams compete against each other, following a tradition which is over a hundred years old. There is a regatta in almost every seaside town between July and October.\n\nIn the Basque Country the tradition of building soapbox cars goes back at least to the early 20th century. The name is a contraction of \"goitik-behera\" which means \"from the top to the bottom\". Unlike most European soapbox cars, the \"goitibeherak\" are three-wheelers and the early versions simply consisted of a triangular frame on three wheels or even scavenged ball bearings with a plank to sit upon, which children would race down the slopes found in many Basque towns.\n\nThe earliest documented races date back to the mid-1970s, when races were held during local festivals. The first Basque national competition was held in 1976, and they are common events all over the Basque Country today. One of the biggest events, the \"Goitibehera Munduko Txapelketa\" (World Goitibehera Championship) was first held in 1985 in Pamplona during the San Fermínes and has been held at irregular intervals since, the last time on 28 June 2008 when the IX World Championship was held.\n\nThe normal soapbox races are called \"carreras de carrilanas\" in Spanish but this version is called \"goitiberas\" even in Spanish. They occur in the Basque Country and Uruguay to where they were exported by Basque emigrants.\n\nThe frog game is a pub game played both in the Basque Country and outside. In the Basque Country, it is commonly played in Basque sagardotegiak (cider houses) and taverns. The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible by aiming 10 metal disks at the frog chest.\n\nThe chest can be placed at a number of distances away from the players, usually 8-15 paces. On top of the chest there is an iron frog with an open mouth, a mill and a bridge. Underneath are more empty compartments. In most variants if one manages to hit the frog's mouth, you are awarded 50 points, 25 for getting the disc under the mill, 10 for the bridge and 5 for any of the compartments below. Other score systems also exist.\n\nSome frog chests have obstacles built into the frog, mill and bridge to make the game more difficult. Disks that have hit the mark are collected at the back of the chest via a set of metal tubes.\n\nIn Spanish this game is called \"juego de la rana\" in Spain and Chile, \"juego de sapo\" in Peru and Argentina, \"tiro al sapo\" in Bolivia or just \"rana\" in Colombia. In French it is referred to as \"jeu de la grenouille\". In England, it is known as Toad in the hole.\n\nAlso a popular sport in the Basque country. There are broadly speaking two categories:\n\nA highly popular race, the Korrika, is held once a year in aid of Basque schools and crosses all parts of the Basque Country.\nThe goal is not competition, but the raising of funds and awareness.\n\nA variant of the \"korrika\" are the \"ibiltariak\" (walkers), a fast walking race that was particularly popular in Navarre in the 19th and 20th century with the walkers wearing the abarketa, a traditional Basque leather shoe, and a hazel stick.\n\nThe traditional forms of running \"korrika\" have been largely supplanted by modern forms of running and racing.\n\nThis variant of the Neapolitan greasy pole game is usually played on a yard that is suspended horizontally over water. A piece of cloth is attached to the far end of the yard and competitors have to try to reach it and retrieve it.\nA variant uses a greased vertical pole.\nIt can also be spelled \"kukaña\", a word which derives from the Spanish word \"cucaña\" (Cockaigne), in French \"monter du mât\".\n\nThis is a competition involving the laia, a farming implement that resembles a two-pronged heavy pichtfork with an off-centre handle, either with a long or short handle. Traditionally four or five members of either gender of a baserri family are picked to compete as a team, the task being to turn over a plot of land as quickly as possible.\n\nA variation of this is \"laia lasterketa\", a \"laia\" race where the competitors stand on a pair of \"laiak\" and race, not dissimilar to a race on stilts.\n\nThe \"laia\" was a very widespread instrument used to loosen soil. With the advent of modern farming machinery, its use is now restricted to area machines cannot reach, for example on high slopes, and kitchen gardens.\n\nIn Spanish this is called \"layadores\" or \"layar\", in French as \"bêcher\".\n\nIn this game two players sit on the ground with their feet touching, separated by a plank. Both players also hold onto a makila and the aim is to lift your opponent to their feet.\n\nIn Spanish this is called \" Tiro del palo\", in French as \"tir au bâton\".\n\nThis term in Basque covers two sorts of chicken games: \n\nThe \"throwing of a metal bar\" was once one of the most popular and widespread of Basque sports. Its popularity waned during the 19th century. Having died out in most areas, it survived the longest in parts of Gipuzkoa until its ultimate demise in the 20th century.\n\nThe \"palankari\" (thrower) throws a \"palanka\", a traditional mining tool weighing between 8–25 kg as far as possible. Various throwing techniques were employed, most involving the \"palankari\" twisting around before launching the \"palanka\". Some techniques by name are:\n\nThe origins of this sport are in the mining industry where the \"palanka\" was traditionally used to prepare the holes into which explosives were then placed from the 15th century onwards. As a pastime, the miners would see who could throw the heavy tool the furthest in their breaks.\n\nCuriously, the Spanish athlete Miguel de la Quadra-Salcedo used a javelin throwing technique based on the Basque techniques of throwing the \"palanka\" at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Initially breaking the world record in javelin throwing, his record was later annulled when the IAAF amended its rules to exclude techniques that at any point in time involve the athlete or the javelin face or point towards the audience.\n\nIn Spanish this is called \"lanzamiento de barra\" or \"barra vasca\" and in French \"lancement de bar de mine\".\n\nThis sport involves a pitcher variously called \"pegarra\", \"bera\", \"pedarra\" and \"kantarue\" in Basque. It is a traditional ceramic pitcher that resembles a fat teapot, with a diameter at the base of around 20 cm, a lid on the top with about 10 cm diameter and about 30 cm tall and a fairly large spout. It can either be glazed or unglazed, with one or three handles (if it was designed to be hung) that was traditionally used to carry water.\n\nIt is carried on a head cushion called \"burutea\" and the aim of a race is to get to the finish line without dropping the \"pegarra\". It is difficult to ascertain how old the sport is but one of the earliest records of the \"pegarra\" being used to carry water on the head dates back to a Dutch book from 1603 called \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\" by Abraham Ortelius which has an illustration of a Basque woman carrying a \"pegarra\".\n\nIn Spanish this is called \"carrera de pedarras\" and in French \"course de pedarras\".\n\nThe Basque sport best known outside the Basque Country is Basque pelota. It is a Basque version of the family of ball games that covers squash, tennis, and real tennis, all of them thought to derive from the Jeu de paume and hence a relative of Valencian pilota.\n\nBut the main innovation of Basque pilota is that players share a common playground and throw the ball to a wall, making it an \"indirect game\", while the other games in this family are generally \"direct games\" where the players face each other in two separate fields separated by a net or line on the ground. The Basques began playing pelota \"indirectly\" during the middle of the 19th century. For the different variations of Basque pelota, see the main article on Basque pelota.\n\nWhile most of the best world players are Basque (in either the Spanish or the French federations), it is by no means limited to the Basque Country and is also played in Castile, Rioja and places where Basques have emigrated to such as Mexico (home of frontenis), Florida and the Philippines.\n\nAs such it has been an Olympic exhibition sport in Paris, Mexico and Barcelona.\n\nIt is called \"pelota vasca\" in Spanish and \"pelote basque\" in French.\n\nBasque arm wrestling follows broadly the same rules as anywhere else.\n\nA form of bull-leaping called \"errekorteak\" in Basque and \"recortes\" in Spanish, is practiced in parts of the Basque Country, especially Navarre.\n\nThe name of this sport literally translates as \"snout rope\" (\"soka\" \"rope\" and \"mutur\" \"snout\").\nIt is \"vaquillas\" (\"calves\") in Spanish.\nIt derives from a tradition where cattle destined for slaughter were led through the town on long ropes regularly on a particular day of the week (which varies from town to town). Occasionally a bull would break free on run wild, an event called \"karrera egitea\" (to make a run), while the crowds made sport of the bulls. From the 14th century onwards bulls were increasingly let loose on purpose, ultimately leading to the tradition of running the bulls. It's also known as \"soka-mutilen jokoa\", the game of the rope boys.\n\nSometimes this would happen at night, with lights attached to the bulls, the most likely forerunner of the \"zezen-suzko\" or \"fire bull\". In the \"zezen-suzko\", a contraption of fireworks is strapped to a bull and lit at night.\n\nToday this is sometimes also practised in bullrings, either temporary or permanent, using calves rather.\nIf fully grown bulls are used it is as a prelude for a bullfight, which is a regular feature of the Running of the Bulls in Iruñea/Pamplona.\n\nThis is game involves throwing small objects like pebbles, balls or coins across a distance, trying to hit the target, a vertical metal pole.\n\nIt is called \"juego de la raya\" in Spanish and \"jeu de la raie\" in French.\n\nSheepdog trials are another lively example of the Basque traditional pastoral lifestyle. They're also called \"artzain txakurren trebetasun lehiaketak\" or \"shepherd dogs skill competitions\".\n\nSheepdog trials in the Basque Country are very similar to those held in other countries and involves a sheepdog having to herd a flock of ewes into a fold. Traditionally the \"euskal artzain txakurra\" or Basque shepherd dog is kept but border collies are also increasingly popular. Identifying the best dogs for breeding is an important part to these competitions. A major Basque sheepog trial event is held in Oñati in September.\n\nIn Spanish this is called \"concursos de perro pastor\" and in French \"concours de chien de berger\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4314883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4314883", "title": "Branch House", "text": "Branch House\n\nBranch House in Richmond, Virginia, was designed in 1916 by the firm of John Russell Pope as a private residence of financier John Kerr Branch (1865–1930) and his wife Beulah Gould Branch (1860–1952).\n\nThe house lies within Richmond's Monument Avenue Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1967. Branch House itself was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The district's status was extended in 1989 and subsequently upgraded to a National Historic Landmark in 1997.\n\nAfter a Branch family heir gifted the home to a local charity in the 1950s, the house changed ownership several times until it was purchased in 2003 by the Virginia Architecture Foundation (formerly the Virginia Center for Architecture Foundation) and reopened in 2005 as headquarters of its successor, the Virginia Center for Architecture (VCA), offices for the Virginia Society of the American Institute of Architects (VSAIA) and its now defunct publication, \"Inform\" magazine, and an architectural museum.\n\nThe Branch House would subsequently (2015) operate as The Branch Museum of Architecture and Design (The Branch), offices for AIA Virginia American Institute of Architects (AIAVA), and an architecture and design museum.\n\nJohn Kerr Branch was born in Danville, Virginia, to Mary Louise\nMerritt Kerr (1840–1896) and John Patteson Branch (1830–1915), both originally of Petersburg, Virginia. The elder Branch was a noted Richmond banker, investor, financier and philanthropist. On his death in 1915, \"The New York Times\" called him the \"Nestor of Richmond Bankers.\"\n\nJohn Kerr Branch grew up in Richmond and attended the McGuire School, subsequently studying in Paris and Germany (1882–1884). At age 21 he began clerking with his father's firm, Thomas Branch & Company. Branch invested successfully in real estate and railroads; ultimately inherited his family's banking fortune; and became director of the Continental Insurance Company of New York (chiefly involved with Southern cotton mills and railroads) and the Petersburg Savings and Insurance Company. He became President of Merchants National Bank of Richmond (having founded the bank in 1871); President of Thomas Branch and Company, later Branch & Company, (1837–1976); and President of Bankers and Brokers, Richmond. He was a member of the New York Stock Exchange and in addition to numerous Richmond clubs, also a member of the New York Yacht Club and the Downtown Association of New York.\n\nBranch met Beulah Frances Gould in Germany on a retreat in the Black Forest. Both Quakers, they married in 1886 at the Gould family's rural estate, \"Elmwood,\" at Quaker Hill, Pawling, New York, and subsequently had three children: John Akin (born 1887), Zayde Bancroft Branch (born 1891), and Louise Branch (born 1900).\n\nBranch had already begun a career as an avid collector at age 19, when he acquired two 16th-century chairs. He and his wife Beulah later became widely known as collectors of Italian Renaissance paintings, furniture, tapestries, woodwork and armour. For the design of their new home, they began working with the firm of John Russell Pope in 1914, well before the firm's noted commissions in Washington, D.C. At the time when the Branches commissioned the home, Pope's firm had just won the competition to design Richmond's Broad Street Train Station, just two blocks to the north on land owned by Branch's father near Monument Avenue's Jefferson Davis memorial. The elder Branch gifted an entire city block to his son and daughter on condition that they build their homes there. John Kerr built on one half of the block, and construction was complete in 1919 at a cost of $160,000, roughly the equivalent of $19 million in 2010.\n\nThe Branches lived \"seasonally,\" maintaining \"Elmwood\", their farm estate at Quaker Hill, Pawling, New York and later also acquiring a 15th-century Italian Renaissance villa near Florence (Villa Marsilio Ficino in Fiesole). Branch House was their winter home.\n\nJohn Kerr Branch died in Fiesole on July 1, 1930, at age 65 of bronchitis, and was buried in Richmond. Beulah Gould Branch continued to live in the home until her death in 1952. Their daughter, Zayde Branch Rennolds (Mrs. Edmond Addison Rennolds Sr.) subsequently gifted the home to a Richmond charity. A decade later, in the late 1960s, their granddaughter Zayde Rennolds Dotts (Mrs. Walter Dotts, Jr.) created the Monument Avenue Preservation Society to protect the surroundings of the home her grandparents had commissioned.\n\nAfter designing Branch House, the firm of John Russell Pope (1874–1937) became widely known for designing the National Archives and Records Administration building (1935), the Jefferson Memorial (1943) and the West Building of the National Gallery of Art (1941) in Washington, DC. Pope's partner, Otto R. Eggers (1882–1964), completed those commissions after Pope's death in 1937, and subsequently designed prominent projects including the interior of the (1952) and the Morehead Planetarium at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nBranch House was thus elevated to the National Register because it was designed by one of the country's prominent architectural firms during the early 20th century; because it is the only example of the firm's domestic work in Virginia; and because it is the only example of the firm's Tudor-Jacobean Revival residences in which the interiors have survived intact. In addition, the house is located within a historic district of cultural significance and is the largest house in the city of Richmond.\n\nBranch House also accurately reflects a particular period of American history, in the early decades of the twentieth century, when English architectural styles were fashionable among wealthy industrialists and financiers. The client was also scion to a distinguished Virginia family and had assembled a substantial collection of Renaissance artifacts.\n\nAfter receiving the gift of half a city block from his father, John Kerr and Beulah Branch commissioned the firm of John Russell Pope for the design. The site was adjacent to the colonnaded memorial to Jefferson Davis at 2501 Monument Avenue at Davis Street, in what is now the Monument Avenue Historic District, itself within Richmond's Fan district. Notably, the site is on axis with the Broad Street Station to the north, possibly related to John Kerr Branch's professional associations with the railroad.\n\nAccording to the 1984 application to the National Register of Historic Places, Pope himself had limited involvement in the project and never visited the building. The architectural construction drawings were dated August 18, 1916, and signed by his business partner, architect Otto R. Eggers. Floor plans included 28 major rooms: public halls, galleries, private suites, servants' quarters, a ballroom, and storage rooms designated specifically for carpets, china, paintings – and suits of armour.\n\nThe overall size of the house has been reported as ranging from 27,000 to 33,000 sq ft. It is roughly three times the size of its neighbors on Monument Avenue.\n\nBranch House features a central portion flanked by two projecting pavilions. The roof is double-pitched with parapets and castellation (or crenelations), creating numerous complexities and hidden flat areas. The eastern pavilion has a three-story castellated bay. The 1984 application to the National Register of Historic Places described the home's relationship to the street as \"extremely awkward.\" Pope's office had made provision for a garage on Park Avenue, but a two-door garage was not added until the 1920s, at the west end of the building.\n\nAlthough from the outside the house appears to have three storeys, and although the interior is logically laid out, the interior is organized on numerous different levels — variously reported as ranging from 11 levels to as many as 19.\n\nThe historic style of Branch House has been variously reported as Tudor, Tudor Revival, Tudor-Jacobean or Domestic Tudor. The 1984 application to the National Register of Historic Places noted that the design \"incorporated salient features from several 16th-century English country houses to form a convincingly correct assemblage of design elements,\" adding that \"to maintain the illusion of age, the architect had the building materials distressed and aged to add patina to the image of power and pedigree\" and furthermore that \"barons of American industry, finance, and culture, such as Branch, appropriated the traditions of English domestic architecture as a way of asserting a noble lineage for their class.\"\n\nJohn Russell Pope had traveled extensively and the firm based the design for Branch House on a large 16th-century country house in Warwickshire, England known as Compton Wynyates, which features numerous exterior details also found at Branch House including linenfold paneling inside and exterior half-timbering and brick diapering, along with oriel and casement windows with leaded glass. Pope's office primarily borrowed details and design elements from Compton Wynyates, which wraps around a large interior courtyard, sits on the interior of a large country parcel, and is highly expansive and asymmetrical. Branch House, by contrast, includes no courtyard, sits adjacent to a street corner on an urban parcel and is largely compact and more symmetrical.\n\nExterior features of Branch House include its perimeter wall of brick construction, wall materials of weathered brick combined with distressed and patinized briarcliff sandstone, sculpted stone motifs, sandstone door and window surrounds, chimney pots, brickwork with diamond diapering, leaded glass, carved-stone heraldry, oriel windows with cul-de-lampe (corbeling resembling the conical bottom of ancient lamps), bargeboards resembling those of Compton Wynyates, inscriptions at the window heads referring to the Branch family's arrival in Virginia during the 17th century, a tower reminiscent of that at Hampton Court Palace, and three characteristically Tudor twisted brick chimneys that resemble those found in Tudor pattern books of the period.\n\nThe interior features vaulted ceilings, curvilinear tracery featuring heraldic symbols, heavily decorated pargeted Tudor-style plaster molding, and modern features including fireproof concrete floors and a redundant boiler in case the primary boiler failed. Utilizing artifacts from the Branches' personal Renaissance collection, the house incorporated an Italian door and a carved wood gallery screen (or minstrel screen) from England. Until Beulah Gould Branch's death, almost every wall surface in the home's primary rooms was covered with the couple's collection of tapestries and textiles.\n\nIn 1953, Branch House was given by Zayde Branch Rennolds (Mrs. Edmund Addison Rennolds Sr.), the daughter of Beulah and John Kerr Branch, to the Richmond Community Chest, which subsequently became the United Givers Fund, in turn becoming the Richmond office of the United Way. After Beulah Gould Branch's death and during the years 1957–1975, the house became known as the Branch Memorial House.\n\nBy 1966, the house was occupied by a group of nine charities, including the United Way and the American Cancer Society. As the headquarters for the United Way of Greater Richmond, Branch House hosted numerous social events, meetings, and community activities, including the summer concert series of the Richmond Pops Band.\n\nIn 1982, Robert E. Pogue of Richmond and his wife Janice W. Pogue of Richmond bought the house and set up the offices of Pogue & Associates, Inc., an insurance agency representing Northwestern Mutual. The Pogues subsequently donated a preservation easement to the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. In exchange for tax benefits, the easement stipulated that \"no major changes (could) be made to the exterior or interior, in perpetuity.\" In December 1983, the Pogues successfully applied to list Branch House on the National Register of Historic Places. During its use by the Pogues and Northwestern Mutual, the house was extensively rehabilitated and again made available for public events.\n\nBy 1990, the insurance agency had outgrown the house and put it up for sale for an asking price of 2.5 million.\n\nIn 2003, the Virginia Center for Architecture Foundation (VCAF), precursor to the Virginia Center for Architecture (VCA), purchased the landmark for $2 million, subsequently verifying historic preservation tax credits, coordinating work with the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, and undertaking a $2 million renovation. The renovation repaired flat sections of the complex roof system, repaired the leaded-glass casement windows, removed paint from its interior stonework, modernized the HVAC systems and brought the facility into compliance with the accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nOn April 1, 2005, the facility opened as a museum, incorporating galleries, shops and offices. Two large rooms, one a long gallery along the northern wall of the house and another the former living room, provide exhibit space. In addition to the museum, which is an affiliate of the International Confederation of Architectural Museums, Branch House accommodates the offices of the Virginia Society of the American Institute of Architects (VSAIA) and the Virginia Center for Architecture (VCA); the editorial office of VSAIA's publication, \"Inform\" magazine; a museum shop; as well as the main legal offices of Dominion General Counsel. A rare book shop, Collectors Old Book Shop, operates on the second floor, having relocated with VSAIA and VCAF when they moved from Barret House in Richmond. Beulah Gould Branch's bedroom now serves as the official boardroom of VCA and VSAIA. Branch House's original chapel room remains undeveloped.\n\nIn 2013, the museum received a $250,000 gift from the Elwood Fund, administered by the descendants of John Kerr and Beulah Gould Branch. In 2014, the museum dedicated one of the facility's gallery's in honor of Zayde Branch Rennolds and in recognition of the 2013 Elwood Fund gift.\n\nAs of 2015 the former residence is known as the Branch Museum of Architecture and Design.\n\n\n\n"}

More specifically, the Iron-Age civilization exemplified by the Bura culture was centered in the southwest portion of modern-day Niger and in the southeast part of contemporary Burkina Faso (formerly known as Upper Volta). \nIron industry, in both smelting and forging for tools and weapons, had developed in Sub-Saharan Africa by 1200 BC. The first-millennium Bura-Asinda culture in the West African Sahel has been radio-carbon dated as starting in the 3rd century AD and lasting until the 13th century. But very little is precisely understood about this \"shadowy\" and \"mysterious\" civilization and its culture because it was discovered only a few decades ago in 1975; and it was not until 1983 that the first archeological excavation was commenced. \nNamed for the Bura archeological site near Bura in southwest Niger, the Bura culture produced a variety of distinctive artifacts made of clay, iron and stone.\n\nHowever, it is not yet known how the entire Bura system linked up to other ancient African cultures and to such later Islamic-influenced Sahelian kingdoms as Ghana, early Mali, later Mali, or Songhai.\n"}

Customs vary as between rural and urban areas, with many city dwellers being influenced by western ideas. The choice of a spouse is usually undertaken by the families of young men and women, sometimes with the help of a matchmaker. \nA man usually marries between the ages of nineteen and twenty-five and a girl between sixteen and twenty-two. After a spouse has been selected, a go-between discusses the proposal with the parents, who need to be satisfied that the right choice is being made for their offspring. Presents are exchanged, and in rural areas, a young man may have to vow to serve his new father-in-law for a while.\n\nThe wedding usually lasts for a day and a half. It starts at the bride's home followed by a religious ceremony and exchange of ritual gifts. The garments worn are covered with jewellery as a mark of respect to the parents of bride and groom, and all the couple's relatives and friends are present. The parents offer blessings and the couple pray to the monks for a happy life. In theory a man may have more than one wife if he can afford it. Divorce is possible but is looked on askance by the community. A magistrate may legalise the divorce. Both parents have obligations for the continuing support of any children, and can remarry if they wish.\nThough adolescent Cambodian children usually play with members of the same sex, boys and girls take part in group games during festivals, offering them the opportunity to begin looking for future mates. Virginity is seen as highly valued in brides, and premarital sex is deplored. A girl who becomes pregnant out of wedlock is seen as bringing shame to her family.\n\nThe choice of a spouse is a complex one for the young male, and it may involve not only his parents and his friends, as well as those of the young woman, but also a matchmaker. A young man can decide on a likely spouse on his own and then ask his parents to arrange the marriage negotiations, or the young person's parents may make the choice of spouse, giving the child little to say in the selection. In theory, a girl may veto the spouse her parents have chosen.\n\nCourtship patterns differ between rural and urban Khmer. Attitudes in the larger cities have been influenced by Western ideas of romantic love that do not apply in the countryside. A man usually marries between the ages of nineteen and twenty-five, a girl between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two. Marriage between close blood relatives is common. After a spouse has been selected, a go-between meets with the parents and broaches the subject of marriage. Then each family will investigates the other to make sure its child is marrying into a good family. When both sides agree to the marriage and presents have been exchanged and accepted, the families consult an achar to set the wedding date. In rural areas, there is a form of bride-service; that is, the young man may take a vow to serve his prospective father-in-law for a period of time.\n\nThe traditional wedding is a long and colourful affair. Formerly it lasted three days, but by the 1980s it more commonly lasted a day and a half. The ceremony begins in the morning at the home of the bride and is directed by the achar. Buddhist priests offer a short sermon and recite prayers of blessing. Parts of the ceremony involve ritual hair cutting and tying cotton threads soaked in holy water around the couple's wrists. The Khmer Rouge divided families and separated the men from the women. The father, mother, and children frequently were separated for many months. A man and woman often did not have time to consummate a marriage, and sexual relations were limited by long separations. Extramarital relations and even flirtations between young people were heavily punished.\n\nThe legend of Preah Thaong and Neang Neak explains many Khmer wedding customs, in which the groom carries the bride's scarf, symbolising that he is from afar and is marrying into her family, in contrast to Indian wedding customs where the bride holds the groom's scarf. The bride and groom wear garments decorated with jewellery, and are surrounded by family and guests. The couple's garments are a sign of respect to their parents and parents-in-law, both of whom offer their blessings to the couple. They also pray to the monks for a happy life.\n\nDivorced persons are viewed with some disapproval, and they are not invited to take part in the blessing of a newlywed couple. Some of the common grounds for divorce are incompatibility, prolonged absence without good reason, abandonment by either partner, refusal of the husband to provide for the family, adultery, immoral conduct, and refusal, for more than a year, to permit sexual intercourse. A magistrate may legalise the divorce. Each spouse retains whatever property he or she brought into the marriage. Property acquired jointly is divided equally. Divorced persons may remarry, but the woman must wait ten months. Custody of minor children is usually given to the mother. Both parents continue to have an obligation to contribute financially toward the rearing and education of the child.\n\nIn theory a man may have multiple wives if he can afford them, but this is rare in practice; the first wife may veto the taking of a second wife. Concubinage also exists, although it is more frequent in the cities. While second wives have certain legal rights, concubines have none.\n"}

It was released in North America on February 25, 2002 and in Europe on March 15, 2002.\n\n\"The Huge Adventure\" is the seventh installment in the \"Crash Bandicoot\" video game series and the first \"Crash Bandicoot\" game to be released on a handheld console. The game acts as an alternate sequel to the first four mainline games, and its story centers on a plot to shrink the Earth by the main antagonist, Doctor Neo Cortex, through the use of a gigantic weapon named the \"Planetary Minimizer\". The protagonist of the story, Crash Bandicoot, must gather Crystals in order to power a device that will return the Earth to its proper size, defeating Doctor Cortex and his minions along the way.\n\nThe game stemmed from an agreement between Universal Interactive Studios and Konami that enabled them to produce and publish (respectively) a \"Crash Bandicoot\" game for next-generation handheld game systems, ending the franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles. \"Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure\" received generally favorable reviews from critics. The game was praised for its graphics and overall design, but critics noted the game's lack of innovation.\n\n\"Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure\" is a platform game in which the player controls Crash Bandicoot, who must gather 20 Crystals and reverse the shrinkage of the Earth at the hands of Doctor Neo Cortex, the main antagonist of the story. Much of the game takes place in a series of hubs, from which Crash can teleport to various areas of the Earth. Initially, only the first of four hubs is available for play. Each hub features five levels and a boss level. The goal in each level is to find and obtain a hidden Crystal. After completing all five levels in a hub, the boss level must be completed, in which Crash must defeat the boss character guarding the area. By defeating the boss, a new hub will be accessible for play. When all 20 Crystals are collected and the Earth has been enlarged to its proper size, the game is won.\n\nBesides Crystals, Gems and Colored Gems can be collected for extra accomplishment. Gems are rewarded to the player if all of the crates in a level are broken open or if a secret area is completed. Colored Gems are found in special levels and lead to hidden areas. \"Relics\" can be won by re-entering a level where the Crystal has already been retrieved. To obtain a Relic, the player must initiate the \"Time Trial\" mode and race through a level in the pre-designated time displayed before entering a level. To begin a Time Trial run, the player must enter a level and activate the floating stopwatch near the beginning of the level to activate the timer; if the stopwatch is not touched, the level is played regularly. The player must then race through the level as quickly as possible. Scattered throughout the level are yellow crates with the numbers 1, 2 or 3 on them. When these crates are broken, the timer is frozen for the number of seconds designated by the box. Sapphire, Gold and Platinum Relics can be won depending on the player's final time.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, Crash has the ability to jump to navigate ledges, spin in a tornado-like fashion to break open crates and defeat enemies, deliver a body slam to break open tough objects and can either slide across the ground or crouch and crawl to get past low areas. Crash can expand on these abilities by defeating boss characters, often resulting in more powerful attacks or increased jumping and running prowess. Crash starts the game with six lives. Crash loses a life when he is struck by an enemy attack or suffers any other type of damage. More lives can be earned by instructing Crash to collect 100 \"Wumpa Fruits\" or break open a special crate to collect a life. Crash can be shielded from enemy attack by collecting an Aku Aku mask. Collecting three of these masks allows temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers.\n\nEight returning characters from previous \"Crash\" titles star in \"Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure\". The protagonist of the game, Crash Bandicoot, is an anthropomorphic bandicoot who must reverse the shrinkage of the Earth caused by the main antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex. Crash's genius sister, Coco Bandicoot, is the creator of the machine necessary to reverse the effects of Cortex's \"Planetary Minimizer\". Aiding Crash is Aku Aku, an ancient wooden mask who can temporarily protect Crash from harm. The main antagonist of the series, Doctor Neo Cortex, is a mad scientist who shrinks the Earth down to the size of a grapefruit with his new \"Planetary Minimizer\". Overseeing Cortex's plot is Uka Uka, the evil twin brother of Aku Aku. Cortex's minions consist of Tiny Tiger, a hulking muscle-bound beast, Dingodile, a flamethrower-wielding dingo-crocodile hybrid and Doctor N. Gin, Cortex's cyborg right-hand man.\n\nIn a space station orbiting the Earth, Uka Uka is upset with Doctor Neo Cortex for failing him once again, but Cortex promises a plan that will bring the Earth's inhabitants down to size. Cortex then introduces his Planetary Minimizer, which he immediately uses to shrink the Earth down to the size of a grapefruit. The situation is brought to Aku Aku's attention when Cortex taunts the now-microscopic people of Earth. When Aku Aku informs Crash of the Earth's predicament, Coco assumes that Cortex is using the Crystals to power his shrinking machine, and requests that Crash find the same kind of Crystals in various locations around the world, which she will use to build a device that will reverse the effects of Cortex's Minimizer.\n\nAfter Crash fends off Dingodile, Doctor N. Gin and Tiny Tiger, Cortex decides to deal with Crash himself by firing the Planetary Minimizer at him. Unfortunately for him, Crash tricks him into shrinking the colored Gems that stabilize the Minimizer, causing it to malfunction. The unrestrained effects of the Minimizer fuse Cortex and the previous bosses together, creating a monster known as Mega-Mix, who chases Crash down the space station's hallway in an attempt to kill him. Fortunately, Crash escapes back to the Earth just in time for Coco to use the Crystals that he has gathered to return the Earth back to normal again. The Earth is returned to its original size, while the space station above Earth explodes and Cortex and the others escape in an escape pod.\n\nOn September 21, 2000, Konami and Universal Studios announced that they had entered an agreement that would enable Konami to publish a \"Crash Bandicoot\" game for next-generation game systems, with Universal Interactive handling the production of the games. The Game Boy Color was originally included alongside the Game Boy Advance in the deal. The agreement served to break the \"Crash Bandicoot\" franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles and effectively made Crash Bandicoot a mascot character for Universal rather than Sony. That December, Vicarious Visions approached Universal and showed off some of their technology on the Game Boy Advance. Fairly impressed with their work, Universal asked Vicarious Visions to submit a concept. Liking the submitted concept, Universal commissioned a prototype; the prototype resembled a handheld version of the PlayStation \"Crash Bandicoot\" games. Vicarious Visions was then given developmental duties for the Game Boy Advance \"Crash Bandicoot\" game.\n\nThe game was tentatively titled \"Crash Bandicoot Advance\" and went through the titles \"Crash Bandicoot X/S\" and \"Crash Bandicoot: The Big Adventure\" before arriving at its final name. The game was developed over the course of nine months from conception to completion. The team working on the game expanded to as much as seven programmers at the height of the game's development. The graphics and animation for the game were created in Maya. Some of the original animation and textures from \"\" were repurposed and used as a basis for the Game Boy Advance game. The sprite for the Crash Bandicoot character features between 1000 and 1500 frames of animation. The audio for the game was supplied by Shin'en Multimedia, with Manfred Linzner creating the sound effects and Todd Masten composing the music. Shin'en Multimedia was assisted by Universal Sound Studios while creating the game's audio. The game uses a static random access memory battery, allowing the player to save their progress. The game was designed with battery saving in mind from the beginning of production, as keeping track of all the data would prove extremely cumbersome with a password system.\n\nIn the United States, \"The Huge Adventure\" sold 750,000 copies and earned $19 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 26th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country.\n\n\"The Huge Adventure\" received generally favorable reviews from critics. Louis Bedigian of GameZone, praising many of the game's elements, concluded that the game was not overshadowed by the series' previous successful titles and offered a new experience. IGN's Craig Harris commented positively on the \"solid controls and level design\" and said that the game's overall design on the Game Boy Advance was \"amazingly tight\". Andrew Reiner of \"Game Informer\", while critical of the short levels, praised the game for its graphical prowess. Four-Eyed Dragon of \"GamePro\" commended the game as \"a superb-looking, straightforward platformer that no interested GBA gamer should miss.\" Scott Alan Marriott of Allgame (\"All Game Guide\" at the time) and Scott Osborne of GameSpy, while acknowledging the game's lack of innovation, stated that the translation of the graphics, gameplay and feel of the PlayStation \"Crash\" games onto the Game Boy Advance was executed well. However, Giancarlo Varanini of GameSpot cited the game's lack of innovation in a more negative manner. A \"Nintendo Power\" reviewer noted that the game's challenges were generally more difficult and sometimes more frustrating than those of the \"Mario\" games. \"Play Magazine\"s reviewer criticized the \"straight-ahead\" nature of the side-scrolling, but called it \"a great, little game\" otherwise. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" remarked that \"\"Crash\" for the GBA is what wanted to be.\"\n\n"}

Only little remains preserved from the old customs. The traditions of arts and crafts are lost nearly completely.\n\nThe inhabitants of Nauru wear the usual tropical clothes: short trousers and light shirts. Fishing still follows a traditional method: the island anglers wait in small light boats for fish to arrive. The custom of fishing by trained frigatebirds has been preserved.\n\nRadio Nauru has collected numerous recordings of local people's music. But even old Nauruans can rarely understand the contents of these songs.\n\nWhilst the traditional culture rapidly gives way to the contemporary, as elsewhere in Micronesia, music and dance still rank among the most popular art forms. Rhythmic singing and traditional \"reigen\" are performed particularly at celebrations and \ncraftsmen make articles of clothing and fans of \"Kokosfasern\" and the sheets of the screw tree and use geometrical samples, which resemble those of the Indonesian culture. Also the wood of the \"kokospalme\" is used for the production of arts and crafts.\n\nThe language of Nauru, Dorerin Naoero, is a Micronesian language. English is understood and spoken widely.\n\nEducation is compulsory from 4 to 16, in all the schools on the island. The University of the South Pacific has a centre in Nauru located in the Aiwo District and offers pre-school teacher education, nutrition and disability studies and will offer the Community Workers Certificate. The campus offers Audio and video conferencing facilities, library and computer laboratory as well as internet and email access via USPNet are available for students.

A 12-team senior league operates in the country, see Australian rules football in Nauru and it is a popular spectator sport. Nauru has competed internationally in Australian rules football at the Arafura Games, Australian Football International Cup and Barassi International Youth Tournament. The national team, the \"Chiefs\", ranked 8th in the International Cup in 2002 and gold medal at the Arafura Games.\n\nNauru's national basketball team made the headlines internationally at the 1969 Pacific Games when it beat the Solomon Islands, which have almost 60 times of Nauru's population, and Fiji, which has almost 100 times of Nauru's population.\n\nNauruans also play soccer, softball, tennis, sailing, swimming and golf. There are only a few sport grounds in Nauru. The only stadium is in Yaren, but it is obsolete and fails to meet international standards. A larger and more modern sports stadium is being built in Meneng, however lack of money has caused the project to stall.

No contemporaneous source records this hand's exact cards, but Frank Wilstach's 1926 book \"Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers\" led to the popular modern conception of the \"dead man's hand\" as containing pairs of black aces and black eights. In Hickok's case these would have been combined with an unknown hole card.\n\nThe expression \"dead man's hand\" appears to have had some currency in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, although no one connected it to Hickok until the 1920s. The earliest detailed reference to it was 1886, where it was described as a \"full house consisting of three jacks and a pair of tens\". Jacks and sevens are called the dead man's hand in the 1903 \"Encyclopaedia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences\". Edmond Hoyle refers to it as Jacks and eights in 1907.\n\nWhat is considered the dead man's hand card combination of today gets its notoriety from a legend that it was the five-card stud hand held by James Butler Hickok (better known as \"Wild Bill\" Hickok) when he was shot in the back of the head by Jack McCall on August 2, 1876, in Nuttal & Mann's Saloon at Deadwood, Dakota Territory. Reportedly, Hickok's final hand included the aces and eights of both black suits.\n\nAccording to a book by Western historian Carl W. Breihan, the cards were retrieved from the floor by a man named Neil Christy, who then passed them on to his son. The son, in turn, told Mr. Breihan of the composition of the hand. \"Here is an exact identity of these cards as told to me by Christy's son: the ace of diamonds with a heel mark on it; the ace of clubs; the two black eights, clubs and spades, and the queen of hearts with a small drop of Hickok's blood on it.\"\n\nHickok biographer Joseph Rosa wrote about the make-up of the hand: \"The accepted version is that the cards were the ace of spades, the ace of clubs, two black eights, and the queen of clubs as the 'kicker'.\" However, Rosa said that no contemporaneous source can be found for this exact hand. The solidification in gamers' parlance of the dead man's hand as two pairs, aces and eights, did not come about until after the 1926 publication of Frank Wilstach's book \"Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers\"—50 years after Hickok's death.\n\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Homicide Division, the Los Angeles Police Department CRASH squad, and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System all use the dead man's hand in their insignia. The western-themed collectible card game \"Doomtown\" makes it the highest rank in the game, with the Jack of diamonds as the fifth card. The Coen Brothers' film The Ballad of Buster Scruggs features the hand in its first segment, where the character Buster Scruggs takes someone's place at a poker table who was dealt this hand before leaving, and subsequently refuses to play it. \n\n"}

Models he has formulated include DSRP, MAC (for learning design), VMCL and NFST (for organizational design). He is also the inventor of MetaMaps and ThinkBlocks.\n\nCabrera received a Ph.D. from Cornell University with a dissertation entitled \"Systems Thinking,\" a synthesis of his research in complexity science and cognition. Cabrera focused his work on the importance of the intersection of ontology and epistemology in understanding human thought and our interactions with the world around us.\n\nTrained as an evolutionary epistemologist, Cabrera says that knowing how we know things is equally important to what we know, and that humans build knowledge not by merely receiving information but through the interactive, dynamic relationship between information and thinking, which he terms DSRP. His book \"Thinking at Every Desk\" expounds upon these ideas in the field of education and was republished by W. W. Norton & Company. His self-published book \"Systems Thinking Made Simple\" explains the patterns of DSRP and VMCL for a general audience and is used as a textbook at Cornell University and West Point Military Academy's Systems Engineering Department.\n\nCabrera serves on the faculty at Cornell, where he designed and teaches a graduate-level courses on systems thinking. He received a post-doctoral fellowship at Cornell where he was awarded a large-scale NSF grant to apply his DSRP theory to the evaluation of large-scale science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs. Cabrera's seminal work in the field of systems evaluation led to the development of \"netway\" models (\"networked pathways\"). Cabrera's systems and netway models form the theoretical basis of Cornell's Office for Research and Evaluation.\n\nHe has received several awards and competitive fellowships for his work, including a National Science Foundation IGERT fellowship in nonlinear systems in the Center for Applied Mathematics and the Department of Theoretical & Applied Mechanics at Cornell University and the Association of American Colleges and Universities K. Patricia Cross Future Leaders Award. He was profiled in a chapter of the book \"Heroes of Giftedness\".\n\nHe was a research fellow at the Santa Fe Institute, where he further developed the mathematical basis for DSRP theory, led a team to create multimedia modules about complexity science and Network theory and also developed a new model that applied systems thinking to the field of evaluation of science programs.\n\nA social entrepreneur, Cabrera established several non-profit and cause-based organizations, including leading fundraising for the Aceh Relief Fund after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. He co-founded an organization called Children of Rural Africa, which builds schools and community development projects in rural Nigeria.\n\nIn 2007, concerned about his experiences teaching ivy league students who were not prepared in terms of thinking skills and abilities, Cabrera and his academic colleague Laura Colosi, also a Ph.D. and Cornell faculty, founded a movement to advance research, innovation, and public understanding of systems thinking and metacognition. Much of their early work focused in the area of education and was based on getting thinking into instruction. They created this movement to ensure that thinking skills were taught to every student nationwide and eventually worldwide. Since its founding, numerous offshoots have been created internationally, in South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia.\n\nCabrera works with educators from K-12 to college and even with organizations to infuse thinking skills into existing curricula using the Patterns of Thinking method (also known as DSRP), which Cabrera created. In the DSRP method, students are encouraged to explore any given concept by recognizing and explicating the distinctions, systems, relationships, and perspectives that characterize the concept. They then physically model the concept using a tactile manipulative Cabrera invented called ThinkBlocks, or graphically represent the concept in terms of DSRP using DSRP diagrams.\n\nCabrera pioneered the theory of DSRP, which states that distinctions, systems, relationships, and perspectives are foundational patterns to all human thought (cognition). D, S, R, and P are implicit in all thinking and Cabrera believes that people can improve their thinking skills by learning to explicitly recognize and explicate (e.g., metacognition) the distinctions, systems, relationships, and perspectives underlying anything they wish to understand more deeply or with greater clarity. Through his work at Cornell University and Cabrera Research Lab, Cabrera has applied DSRP to various fields, including: education, evaluation, organizational design, leadership and management, STEM, water science, public policy, leadership and management, psychology, pedagogy and andragogy, and network theory. He frequently speaks at professional conferences and is a leader in efforts to reform the United States' educational system.\n\nIn 2008, a special section of the journal \"Evaluation and Program Planning\" was dedicated to examining the DSRP theory and method.\n\nOn December 13, 2011, Cabrera was awarded a U.S. patent for \"a method of teaching thinking skills and knowledge acquisition\" - the Patterns of Thinking, or DSRP method.\n\nOn October 26, 2011, Cabrera gave a TEDx talk titled \"How Thinking Works.\" The talk focused on American students' lack of thinking skills, and how students at all levels of education can benefit from learning how they think – in terms of distinctions, systems, relationships, and perspectives. He gave another TEDx talk in 2012 titled \"A Big Toe\" (Theory of Everything) which further elaborates on the details and dynamics of DSRP.\n\nIn July 2014, Cabrera gave the plenary address for the 58th Meeting of the International Society for the Systems Sciences at the School of Business at George Washington University, Washington DC. In July 2014, Cabrera gave the keynote address, with Sir Ken Robinson, at the E3 Conference honoring Cabrera's work in education.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6475070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6475070", "title": "Feminist anthropology", "text": "Feminist anthropology\n\nFeminist anthropology is a four-field approach to anthropology (archeological, biological, cultural, linguistic) that seeks to transform research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge, using insights from feminist theory. Simultaneously, feminist anthropology challenges essentialist feminist theories developed in Europe and America. While feminists practiced cultural anthropology since its inception (see Margaret Mead and Hortense Powdermaker), it was not until the 1970s that feminist anthropology was formally recognized as a subdiscipline of anthropology. Since then, it has developed its own subsection of the American Anthropological Association – the Association for Feminist Anthropology – and its own publication, \"Voices\".\n\nFeminist anthropology has unfolded through three historical phases beginning in the 1970s: the anthropology of women, the anthropology of gender, and finally feminist anthropology.\n\nPrior to these historical phases, feminist anthropologists trace their genealogy to the late 19th century. Erminnie Platt Smith, Alice Cunningham Fletcher, Matilda Coxe Stevenson, Frances Densmore—many of these women were self-taught anthropologists and their accomplishments faded and heritage erased by the professionalization of the discipline at the turn of the 20th century. Prominent among early women anthropologists were the wives of 'professional' men anthropologists, some of whom facilitated their husbands research as translators and transcriptionists. Margery Wolf, for example, wrote her classic ethnography \"The House of Lim\" from experiences she encountered following her husband to northern Taiwan during his own fieldwork.\n\nWhile anthropologists like Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict are representatives of the history of feminist anthropology, female anthropologists of color and varying ethnicities also play a role in the theoretical concepts of the field. Hortense Powdermaker, for example, a contemporary of Mead's who studied with British anthropological pioneer Bronislaw Malinowski conducted political research projects in a number of then a-typical settings: reproduction and women in Melanesia (Powdermaker 1933), race in the American South (Powdermaker 1939), gender and production in Hollywood (1950), and class-gender-race intersectionality in the African Copper Belt (Powdermaker 1962). Similarly, Zora Neale Hurston, a student of Franz Boas, the father of American anthropology, experimented with narrative forms beyond the objective ethnography that characterized the proto/pseudo- scientific writings of the time. Other African American women made similar moves at the junctions of ethnography and creativity, namely Katherine Dunham and Pearl Primus, both of whom studied dance in the 1940s. Also important to the later spread of Feminist anthropology within other subfields beyond cultural anthropology was physical anthropologist Caroline Bond Day and archeologist Mary Leakey.\n\nThe anthropology of women, introduced through Peggy Golde's \"Women in the Field\" and Michelle Rosaldo and Louise Lamphere's edited volume \"Woman, Culture, and Society\", attempted to recuperate women as distinct cultural actors otherwise erased by male anthropologists' focus on men's lives as the universal character of a society. Male anthropologists, Golde argued specifically, rarely have access to women in tribes and societies because of the sexual threat they pose to these women. As such, they receive the stories of men about women in instances when women are present at all. The male anthropologists' ignorance and the indigenous men's domination congeal to create instances where, according to Rosaldo and Lamphere, the asymmetry between women and men becomes universal. A second anthropology of women would arise out of American engagements with Friedrich Engels' The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, arguing that this universal asymmetry was not timeless, but a product of capitalist relations that came to dominate the global mode of production through colonialism. As both approaches grew more vocal in their critique of male ethnographers' descriptions as one-sided, an 'add women and mix' approach to ethnography became popular, whereby women were not necessarily described at detail, but mentioned as part of the wider culture.\n\nIn the wake of Gayle Rubin and her critique of \"the sex/gender system,\" the anthropology of women transformed into an anthropology of gender. Gender was a set of meanings and relationships related to but not isomorphic with biological sex. Women was not a universal community or category that was self-evident. Following the rise of women of color feminism, the anthropology of gender critiqued the early goals of first-wave feminists and anthropologists as overly concerned with bourgeois social ambitions. It did so through a move from documenting the experience of women as a universal population to interpreting the place of gender in broader patterns of meaning, interaction, and power. This includes the work of women anthropologists Henrietta Moore and Ethel Albert. Moore contended that anthropology, even when carried out by women, tended to \"[order] the world into a male idiom [. . .] because researchers are either men or women trained in a male oriented discipline\". Anthropology's theoretical architecture and practical methods, Moore argued, were so overwhelmingly influenced by sexist ideology (anthropology was commonly termed the \"study of man\" for much of the twentieth century) that without serious self-examination and a conscious effort to counter this bias, anthropology could not meaningfully represent female experience.\n\nToday, feminist anthropology has grown out of the anthropology of gender to encompass the study of the female body as it intersects with or is acted upon by cultural, medical, economic, and other forces. This includes the expansion of feminist politics beyond cultural anthropology to physical anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and archeology, as well as feminist anthropology becoming a site for connecting cultural studies, history, literature, and ethnic studies.\n\nFeminist archaeology initially emerged in the late 1970s and early 80s, along with other objections to the epistemology espoused by the processual school of archaeological thought, such as symbolic and hermeneutic archaeologies. Margaret Conkey and Janet Spector’s 1984 paper Archaeology and the Study of Gender summed up the feminist critique of the discipline at that time: that archaeologists were unproblematically overlaying modern-day, Western gender norms onto past societies, for example in the sexual division of labor; that contexts and artifacts attributed to the activities of men, such as projectile point production and butchering at kill sites, were prioritized in research time and funding; and that the very character of the discipline was constructed around masculine values and norms. For example, women were generally encouraged to pursue laboratory studies instead of fieldwork (although there were exceptions throughout the history of the discipline) and the image of the archaeologist was centered around the rugged, masculine, “cowboy of science”.\n\nRecently, feminists in archeology have started to confront the issue of sexual assault during \"field work\" through scholarly research on the social life of archeologists. The Biological Anthropology Field Experiences Web Survey, open to bioarcheologists, primatologists, and other subfields, revealed that 19% of women are sexually assaulted during fieldwork, with 59% of anthropologists—male and female—experiencing sexual harassment.\n\nFeminist cultural anthropology deals with the concept of feminism through the lens of cultural anthropology. When combining these two fields of study, cultural anthropology can be approached in a non-binary way. New information pertaining to research and knowledge from a scholarly perspective also has no restrictions. This field of study may impact feminism and women and gender studies as well because it provides feminist analyses of culture from an anthropological perspective.\n\nIn the 1970s, women started attending undergraduate and graduate universities where the social sciences, which were at one time largely dominated by men, were now being practiced by men and women alike.  With more women in the social science disciplines, they started having an impact on how some issues were being dealt with in the social science fields, such as the emphasis on gender studies and the integration of women’s rights issues into these studies.  Women entering the social science fields had such a large impact on the feminist anthropology movement because before the 1980s, female anthropologists mostly focused on aspects such as family, marriage, and kinship.  Many female anthropologists reacted to this stereotype placed on them, as they wanted to focus on broader aspects of culture in the scholarly community. \n\nWhen feminist anthropology first developed, it was intended to be the subdiscipline of the anthropology of women.  However, feminist cultural anthropology arose as a subfield itself when anthropologists started to realize that women's and gender studies weren’t published as frequently as other topics in anthropology. As feminist anthropology began being practiced by more people and cultural aspects such as race, values, and customs started being considered, focuses on personal identity and differences between people in varying cultures became the main idea surrounding feminist cultural anthropology.  With this advance, female anthropologists started focusing on all aspects of gender and sex and how they vary culturally.  With a focus on feminism through an anthropological lens, women’s role in society and their contributions to the social sciences formed itself a new subfield known as feminist cultural anthropology.\n\nThe relationships of feminist anthropology with other strands of academic feminism are uneasy. By concerning themselves with the different ways in which different cultures constitute gender, feminist anthropology can contend that the oppression of women is not universal. Henrietta Moore argued that the concept of \"woman\" is insufficiently universal to stand as an analytical category in anthropological enquiry: that the idea of 'woman' was specific to certain cultures, and not a human universal. For some feminists, anthropologist Michelle Rosaldo wrote, this argument contradicted a core principle of their understanding of relations between men and women. Contemporary feminist anthropologist Marilyn Strathern argues that anthropology, which must deal with difference rather than seeking to erase it, is not necessarily harmed by this disagreement, but notes nonetheless that feminist anthropology faces resistance.\n\nAnthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theory. On the other hand, anthropologists' claims to include and engage with such other perspectives have in turn been criticised - local people are seen as the producers of local knowledge, which only the western anthropologist can convert into social science theory. Because feminist theorists come predominantly from the west, and do not emerge from the cultures they study (some of which have their own distinct traditions of feminism, like the grassroots feminism of Latin America), their ideas about feminism may contain western-specific assumptions that do not apply simply to the cultures they investigate. Rosaldo criticizes the tendency of feminists to treat other contemporary cultures as anachronistic, to see other parts of the world as representing other periods in western history - to say, for example, that gender relations in one country are somehow stuck at a past historical stage of those in another. Western feminists had, Rosaldo said, viewed women elsewhere as “ourselves undressed and the historical specificity of their lives and of our own becomes obscured”. Anthropology, Moore argued, by speaking \"about\" and not \"for\" women, could overcome this bias.\n\nMarilyn Strathern characterised the sometimes antagonistic relationship between feminism and anthropology as self-sustaining, since “each so nearly achieves what the other aims for as an ideal relation with the world.\". Feminism constantly poses a challenge to the androcentric orthodoxy from which anthropology emerges; anthropology undermines the ethnocentricism of feminism.\n\nFeminist anthropology, Rayna Rapp argues, is subject to a 'double difference' from mainstream academia. It is a feminist tradition – part of a branch of scholarship, sometimes marginalized as an offshoot of postmodernism and deconstructionism and concerned with the experiences of women – who are marginalized by an androcentric orthodoxy. At the same time it addresses non-Western experience and concepts, areas of knowledge deemed peripheral to the knowledge created in the west. It is thus doubly marginalized.\n\nMoore argues that some of this marginalization is self-perpetuating. By insisting on adhering exclusively to the 'female point of view', feminist anthropology constantly defines itself as 'not male' and therefore as inevitably distinct from, and marginal to, mainstream anthropology. Feminist anthropology, Moore says, effectively ghettoizes itself. Strathern argues that feminist anthropology, as a tradition posing a challenge to the mainstream, can never fully integrate with that mainstream: it exists to critique, to deconstruct, and to challenge.\n\n\n"}

He later lived in Palestine until the 1948 Palestinian exodus. His paintings depicted major historical moments during that era in Palestine. Aleef eventually settled in Jordan, where he started the first art college and taught a group of young, local artists who were instrumental in creating a Jordanian art movement. Aleef's family name is sometimes spelled as \"Allief\" or \"Aleev.\"\n\nBorn in Russia, he served as a bodyguard for Tsar Nicholas II of Russia until the October Revolution broke out. He became part of a large group of civilians and former members of the White Russian Army (collectively known as white émigrés) who, after the Russian civil war, retreated to South Crimea and then to Istanbul before ultimately emigrating to other countries.\n\nAleef remained in Istanbul, and during this period, in around 1920, became a professional painter. He later moved to Palestine and in 1948 during the Palestinian exodus, he relocated to Jordan, where he lived until 1967. In Jordan, he set up a studio. Aleef was one of the few artists who arrived in Jordan at that time, willing to give private art lessons in his studio.\n\nAleef was able to make a living by giving painting lessons, Russian language lessons and by selling small works of art. He started the first art college in Jordan, and was considered to be a very useful teacher who introduced locals to easel painting and promoted an appreciation of European art.\n\nLocal artists including Muhanna Al-Dura, Rafiq Lahham, and Suha Katibah Noursi studied in Aleef's studio. According to Dura's memoirs, Aleef taught his students the basics of watercolor, drawing and painting, and the European understanding of perspective. He taught his students to meticuoulsy render a matchbox as an exercise in perspective. Dura along with the other young artists who studied with Aleef helped to spark a local, Jordanian art movement.\n\nAleef's personal experiences living and working in strife-torn countries informed his work. The themes he chose for his work almost always involve real historical episodes or of great monuments. His style is rather neo-classical and has naive traits which are apparent in practically all his works. He used both oils and water color. During his time in Palestine, he painted Jerusalem with an Arabic identity, also portraying a time where mosques, churches and synagogues coexisted peacefully.\n\nHe had many exhibitions in Jerusalem, Amman and Beirut and many of his paintings are hanging at the Jordanian Royal Court, the Jordanian National Gallery and in private Jordanian collections. One of his works, featuring a ruined monument, hangs in the Jordan National Art Gallery.\n\n\n\n"}

Granny dresses were loose-fitting and often printed with light or pastel colors. They had a vaguely Victorian-era feel to them. \n\nGranny dresses had a high neckline and the hems were ankle length. They could also be decorated with buttons, lace, ruffles and may display leg-of-mutton sleeves. As the trend continued, the hemline of the dress could also end just above the knees. The dress became more sophisticated by the late 1960s. The dresses were also inexpensive.\n\nThe look was part of a greater neo-Victorian trend. A \"Life\" magazine spread featured Ringo Starr with a model wearing a crocheted granny dress and which also featured women in Victorian-like settings. The style reminded people of a simpler, less complicated time. \n\nThe trend was also firmly situated in the youth movement. It tended to be associated with both mod and hippie groups. The granny dress offered an alternative to mini dresses and were a symbol of rebellion. Girls talked about it taking \"nerve\" to wear such an old-fashioned style.\n\nGranny dresses are most often associated with the designer, Laura Ashley, who started selling these dresses to women in the Welsh countryside in the late 1950s. The trend made it to the United States where it was embraced in California and then moved eastward. Granny dress parties and dances were held. \n\nOne account credits the creation of the dress to designer, George Wilner, who worked at Mr. Aref of California. Wilner based his design on a calico dress that a retailer from Glendale showed him. Wilner adapted the calico dress design to be more of an empire-style, similar to dresses worn by Empress Josephine. An article describing the \"new craze\" credited the origin to Los Angeles.\n\nAn apocryphal story about the origin of the dress was that it came into fashion after a dancer was told by a television disc jockey that her dress was too short. In response, the dancer found a floor-length dress to wear and started a fashion craze. Another apocryphal origin story had an old woman wearing such a dress on a tour of \"night spots\" in Los Angeles. The woman's youthful vigor \"attracted attention\" and a designer, believing her style of dress helped her stay active, copied her dress design.\n\nGranny dresses have also been popular in various regions in Egypt in the 1980s. \n\nIn the 1990s, there was a brief resurgence of the dress at the same time grunge was popular. This time, granny dresses were considered any kind of loose-fitting frock and could be paired with nearly any accessory.\n\nStudents wearing granny dresses to school were suspended or sent home. In Oakland in 1965, girls were sent home for wearing granny dresses. In Kansas City, Missouri, a mother wore her own granny dress to school in an attempt to convince the principal to allow her daughter to wear one. In Trumansburg, New York, in 1966, three sisters were suspended from school for wearing the dress. The school's attorney claimed that both safety and possible class disruption were the reasons the dress was banned. The principal of the school felt that there was a danger of tripping on stairs because of the length of the dresses. Laura M. Lorraine, dean of the Analy Union High School also thought the length of the dresses made them difficult for walking up stairs. The school attorney felt that granny dresses were \"extreme\" and may encourage students to adopt other extreme forms of dressing. In some cases, school authorities just stated that it wasn't \"suitable school attire.\" In 1966, a \"Dear Abby\" column featured a letter from a girl who was sent to the principal's office for wearing a granny dress.\n\n"}

Its first mention is in 1779, where it is said to have been found in the ground \"a few years ago\". After their discovery, they were kept with the pastor at Herlufmagle, Marcus Schnabel.\n\nA drawing of four of the figurines was made in 1779, by Schnabel. The drawing shows two kneeling figures of warriors with horned helmets and axes, a leaping acrobat, and a standing woman. Five of these figurines are now lost, while two were bought by the Danish National Museum in 1823 and 1839. \n\nBased on comparison with petroglyphs of the same era (e.g. Tanumshede, Sweden), it is assumed that the figurines were originally part of an ensemble arranged on a ship.\n\nBoth the twins motive and the cultic significance of the horned helmets, seems to have persisted into early Germanic culture.

{"id": "216702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216702", "title": "Hammered coinage", "text": "Hammered coinage\n\nHammered coinage is the most common form of coins produced since the invention of coins in the first millennium BC until the early modern period of c. the 15th–17th centuries, contrasting to the cast coinage and the later developed milled coinage.\n\nHammered coins were produced by placing a blank piece of metal (a \"planchet\" or \"flan\") of the correct weight between two dies, and then striking the upper die with a hammer to produce the required image on both sides. The planchet was usually cast from a mold. The bottom die (sometimes called the \"anvil die\") was usually counter sunk in a log or other sturdy surface and was called a \"pile\". One of the minters held the die for the other side (called the \"trussel\"), in his hand while it was struck either by himself or an assistant.\n\nExperimental archeology suggests that a lower die could be expected to last for up to 10,000 strikes depending on the level of wear deemed acceptable. Upper dies seem to have a far greater range of lives with usable lives ranging from just over 100 strikes to nearly 8000 being reported. Combining archaeological evidence with historic records suggests ancient coin producers (in this case the Amphictions at Delphi) could get as many as 47,000 strikes out of an individual die.\nIn later history, in order to increase the production of coins, hammered coins were sometimes produced from strips of metal of the correct thickness, from which the coins were subsequently cut out. Both methods of producing hammered coins meant that it was difficult to produce coins of a regular diameter. Coins were liable to suffer from \"clipping\" where unscrupulous people would remove slivers of precious metal since it was difficult to determine the correct diameter of the coin.\n\nCoins were also vulnerable to \"sweating\", which is when silver coins would be placed in a bag that would be vigorously shaken. This would produce silver dust, which could later be removed from the bag.\n\nThe ability to fashion coins from machines (milled coins) caused hammered coins to become gradually obsolete during the 17th century. They were still made in Venice until the 1770s. France became the first country to adopt a full machine-made coin in 1643.\n\nIn England, the first non-hammered coins were produced in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in the 1560s, but while machine-produced coins were experimentally produced at intervals over the next century, the production of hammered coins did not finally end until 1662.\n\nAn alternative method of producing early coins, particularly found in Asia, especially in China, was to cast coins using molds. This method of coin production continued in China into the nineteenth century. Up to a couple of dozen coins could be produced at one time from a single mold, when a 'tree' of coins (which often contained features such as a square hole in the centre) would be produced and the individual coins (called \"cash\") would then be broken off.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3932687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3932687", "title": "Herald", "text": "Herald\n\nA herald, or a herald of arms, is an officer of arms, ranking between pursuivant and king of arms. The title is commonly applied more broadly to all officers of arms.\n\nHeralds were originally messengers sent by monarchs or noblemen to convey messages or proclamations—in this sense being the predecessors of modern diplomats. In the Hundred Years' War, French heralds challenged King Henry V to fight. During the Battle of Agincourt, the English herald and the French herald, Montjoie, watched the battle together from a nearby hill; both agreed that the English were the victors, and Montjoie provided King Henry V, who thus earned the right to name the battle, with the name of the nearby castle.\n\nLike other officers of arms, a herald would often wear a surcoat, called a tabard, decorated with the coat of arms of his master. It was possibly due to their role in managing the tournaments of the Late Middle Ages that heralds came to be associated with the regulation of the knights' coats of arms. Heralds have been employed by kings and large landowners, principally as messengers and ambassadors. Heralds were required to organise, announce and referee the contestants at a tournament. This science of heraldry became increasingly important and further regulated over the years, and in several countries around the world it is still overseen by heralds. In the United Kingdom heralds are still called upon at times to read proclamations publicly; for which they still wear tabards emblazoned with the royal coat of arms. \n\nThere are active official heralds today in several countries, including the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Canada, and the Republic of South Africa. In England and Scotland most heralds are full-time employees of the sovereign and are called \"Heralds of Arms in Ordinary\". Temporary appointments can be made of \"Heralds of Arms Extraordinary\". These are often appointed for a specific major state occasions, such as a coronation. The Canadian Heraldic Authority has created the position of \"Herald of Arms Emeritus\" with which to honor long-serving or distinguished heraldists. In Scotland, some Scottish clan chiefs, the heads of great noble houses, still appoint private officers of arms to handle cases of heraldic or genealogical importance of clan members, although these are usually pursuivants.\n\nIn addition, many orders of chivalry have heralds attached to them. These heralds may have some heraldic duties but are more often merely ceremonial in nature. Heralds which were primarily ceremonial in nature, especially after the decline of chivalry, were also appointed in various nations for specific events such as a coronation as additions to the pageantry of these occasions. In the Netherlands, heralds are appointed for the Dutch monarch's inauguration where they wore their tabards until 1948; these heralds proclaim the inauguration ceremony to have been completed to those inside and outside the Nieuwe Kerk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was introduced as one of the series' original seven player characters in the first \"Mortal Kombat\" game in 1992, and has become a staple of the series. Created as a parody of martial arts film actor Jean-Claude Van Damme, Cage is a cocky movie star who provides the comic relief of the franchise. He becomes a more rounded character in \"Mortal Kombat X\", which introduces his and Sonya Blade's daughter Cassie Cage.\n\nCage has featured extensively in alternate series media including the two \"Mortal Kombat\" feature films, the \"\" web series, and official series merchandise. General and critical reception of the character has been mostly positive for multiple factors such as his role in the series, his characterization and gameplay, and his Fatality finishing moves.\n\nOriginal concept sketches for a proposed fighting game by artist John Tobias showed a character called \"Michael Grimm, the current box office champion and star of such movies as \"Dragon's Fist\", \"Dragon's Fist II\" and the award-winning \"Sudden Violence\".\" Midway Games had hoped to license martial artist and actor Jean-Claude Van Damme for the game that was intended to be modeled after Van Damme's 1988 film \"Bloodsport\", and the company created a short demo reel that consisted of film footage of Van Damme inserted into a digital background in order to convince the actor to join the project. However, the attempt fell through, and when the fighting game later became \"Mortal Kombat,\" the Michael Grimm character was retained as a spoof of Van Damme and renamed Johnny Cage. According to martial artist Daniel Pesina, who portrayed Cage in the original game and the 1993 sequel \"Mortal Kombat II\", the character was first modeled after Daniel Rand from the \"Iron Fist\" comic series.\n\nAs a narcissistic Hollywood star, Cage serves as comic relief in contrast to the games' more serious characters like Liu Kang and Raiden, which is embellished in the 2011 \"Mortal Kombat\" reboot game with a large tattoo of his first name across his chest. Cage's real name, John Carlton, was taken from Midway artist and programmer John Carlton, who worked on the \"NBA Jam\" game series. Cage's main role in \"Mortal Kombat X\" is as a Special Forces consultant instead of an actor; his design by NetherRealm Studios (formerly Midway Games) was their attempt to define whether or not he had taken his martial arts skills seriously since the aftermath of the 2011 reboot game, and he was outfitted in tactical gear that was designed to fit his fighting style while finding the balance between \"serious or stoic\" and \"too goofy\".\n\nCage was the first character created for \"Mortal Kombat\", and the test prototype of the original game had just two Johnnies fighting each other, while Van Damme's split-legged groin punch from \"Bloodsport\" was included as one of Cage's special moves. He was additionally the last character to be given a Fatality (a finishing move that executes the player's defeated opponent), as he originally was to just throw his opponent across the screen until Tobias ultimately created what would become Cage's decapitation-punch finisher. In \"Mortal Kombat X\", Cage's gameplay style is split into three fighting variations like those of the other playable characters, and Bryan Dawson of Prima Games wrote in 2015 that while Cage was effective at zoning.\n\nIn the original \"Mortal Kombat\", Johnny Cage is a martial artist and actor who enters the Shaolin Tournament simply to prove that he does not rely on special effects in his films, and he is the only character in the game who does not share a past history with the other characters. In the 1993 sequel \"Mortal Kombat II\", Cage disappears from the set of his latest film after following Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang into the otherworldly dimension of Outworld, where he joins forces with other fighters in participating in a second tournament in their successful attempt at protecting Earthrealm (Earth) against Outworld's evil emperor, Shao Kahn.\n\nCage is absent from the series continuity until the 1996 compilation title \"Mortal Kombat Trilogy\", which expands on the events of \"Mortal Kombat 3\" (1995) and its upgrade. He is killed by Shao Kahn's forces during an invasion of Earth, but his path to the afterlife is blocked due to a merger of the realm and Earth, which restores his soul and enables him to help his comrades defeat Kahn, after which he ascends to the heavens. In \"Mortal Kombat 4\" (1997), Cage, at his request, is restored to life by Raiden so he can again fight alongside his friends, this time in attempt to defeat the forces of the disgraced former deity Shinnok.\n\n\"\" (2002) mocks Cage's previous death and resurrection in that he is shooting a film titled \"The Death of Johnny Cage\", but he is displeased with his characterization and he promptly flees the production when Raiden transports him to a new mission in Outworld. However, he and fellow Earthrealm warriors Jax, Kitana, Kung Lao, and Sonya Blade are killed in their attempt to stop the Deadly Alliance from resurrecting the Dragon King Onaga. In \"\" (2004), the first fighting installment in which Cage is not selectable, he and the Earthrealm warriors are resurrected by Onaga (the game's main boss character) for use as his slaves, but they are eventually freed from their mind control by the partnership of reformed ninja Ermac and the spirit of Liu Kang, who had also been slain by the Deadly Alliance.\n\nCage returns along with the series' then-entire playable roster in \"\" (2006), participating in the final tournament that would decide mankind's fate. He is one of only seventeen characters to receive an official game biography, in which he becomes the \"de facto\" leader of Earthrealm's forces after he sees multiple visions of Shinnok and tracks him down to Shang Tsung's island, where Shinnok plots to take over Shao Kahn's rule of Outworld. However, Cage is killed for the third time in the original series continuity when he dies along with the other combatants in a battle royal at the Pyramid of Argus in the fictional realm of Edenia in the game's opening sequence.\n\nIn \"Mortal Kombat\", the 2011 reboot of the first three games, Cage is described as \"a descendant of an ancient Mediterranean cult who bred warriors for the gods\" as an explanation for his special powers. His disembodied head is seen amidst the fighters' corpses in the introduction sequence that depicts the grisly aftermath of the battle and the resulting onset of Armageddon. The storyline then travels back in time to the Shaolin Tournament from the original \"Mortal Kombat\", where Cage is a cocky and talkative martial arts actor who has entered as a publicity stunt and repeatedly flirts with Special Forces lieutenant Sonya Blade. He initially considers the tournament a joke after defeating Outworld minions Reptile and Baraka, until Raiden informs him of the consequences should Outworld emerge victorious, which convinces Cage to fight alongside Raiden's chosen heroes in the game's story mode. However, he is later defeated in the competition by Earthrealm assassin Cyrax, who refuses to kill him. In the retelling of the second tournament from \"Mortal Kombat II\", he is eliminated by Ermac, and during the events of \"Mortal Kombat 3\", Raiden saves Cage from death at the hands of the centaur Motaro. Cage and Sonya are the only Earth warriors to survive the course of the game's plot after their cohorts are killed by Shao Kahn's queen, Sindel.\n\nIn \"Mortal Kombat X\" (2015), while attempting to rescue Sonya from Shinnok, Cage inadvertently discovers his special powers that enable him to assist the thunder god Raiden in imprisoning Shinnok inside a magical amulet. He and Sonya are later married and have a daughter, Cassie, but they divorce due to Sonya's commitment to her career. Twenty-five years after the events of the reboot game, Cage is part of a secret Special Forces unit under Sonya's command and headed by Cassie, who bears her mother's looks and her father's cocky attitude. Near the climax of the game's story mode, Shinnok returns and corrupts the Jinsei (the source of Earthrealm's life force) while holding Cage hostage, but he is rescued after Cassie defeats Shinnok in the final battle, and the Cage family reunites.\n\nIn the 1995 live-action film \"Mortal Kombat\", Johnny Cage is one of Raiden's three chosen warriors with Liu Kang and Sonya, and he takes part in the tournament to prove he is a legitimate fighter after Shang Tsung assumes the identity of Cage's sensei in order to trick him into participating. He defeats Scorpion and Goro, and is handpicked by Shang Tsung to fight him in final combat near the conclusion until Liu Kang accepts the challenge. Cage was played by actor Linden Ashby, who had practiced martial arts before he was cast in the role. He did not return for the 1997 sequel \"\", in which Cage is played by Chris Conrad. During Shao Kahn's invasion of Earth in the beginning of the film, Cage is killed by the emperor in his attempt to save Sonya when she is taken hostage. Pat E. Johnson, the first film's stunt choreographer, recommended Conrad as Ashby's replacement to \"Annihilation's\" producers.\n\nMartial artist Matt Mullins plays Cage in director Kevin Tancharoen's 2010 short film \"\". Cage is a faltering action star who works undercover for police officer Jackson Briggs, but Baraka kills him in a brutal fight. Mullins reprised the role in the third episode of the 2011 web series \"\", with Cage revised as an unemployed television actor who had starred in \"Power Rangers\". Desperate to revive his flailing career, he pitches reality show pilots in which he engages in acts of vigilantism by beating up various criminals, but they are rejected by two executives. Cage later overhears one of them stealing his ideas while proposing a new show to another actor, and he assaults the executive along with two security guards. He is then approached by Shang Tsung as the episode concludes. Mullins was replaced by Casper Van Dien for the 2013 second season, in which it is revealed that Cage refused Shang Tsung's offer to fight for Outworld, and reluctantly agreed to join Raiden's warriors in participating in the tournament. Van Dien compared his career trajectory to that of the character in a 2013 interview with MTV.\n\nIn Malibu Comics' \"Mortal Kombat\" comic book line that ran from 1994 to 1995, Cage first features with the characters from the original game in the 1994 six-issue \"Blood & Thunder\" miniseries, which loosely follows the game's storyline of Shang Tsung hosting the Shaolin Tournament. In the follow-up miniseries \"Battlewave\" (1995), which focuses mainly on the new characters introduced in \"Mortal Kombat II\", Cage has resumed his acting career after the tournament, but later travels to Outworld with Jax to investigate an attack carried out by Goro. He is a supporting character in DC Comics' 2015 twelve-issue \"Mortal Kombat X\" miniseries, with a chapter in the eighth issue devoted to the background of his relationship with Sonya.\n\nCage has been licensed for various action figures produced by Hasbro, Toy Island, and Jazwares. Advanced Graphics released a life-sized Cage cardboard standee in 2011, and Syco Collectibles released a polystone character statuette in 2012.\n\nCage has been rated among the top \"Mortal Kombat\" characters by various gaming media publications, and his Fatality finishing moves over the course of his series appearances have been positively received. Brad Nicholson of Destructoid enthused in 2008 that Cage was \"easily the best character in a fighting game ever,\" and Marcin Górecki of Polish gaming magazine \"Secret Service\" ranked Cage the second-best male fighting-game character in 1996, behind Ryu from the \"Street Fighter\" franchise. However, Shea Serrano of \"Grantland\" rated Cage the second-worst of \"Mortal Kombat II's\" twelve characters in 2012, on the basis of his skill being \"overtaken almost entirely by his own ego.\" In her 2015 review of \"Mortal Kombat X\", Maddy Myers of \"Eurogamer\" questioned what she felt was the implausibility of the \"white-as-snow\" union of Cage and Sonya. Justin Clark of \"Slant Magazine\" considered Cage to be among the \"older, self-serious dinosaurs wrestling with relevance\" in \"Mortal Kombat X\", his cocky attitude notwithstanding.\n\nCritical reception of Cage's characterization in the \"Mortal Kombat\" games and alternate media has proven mixed. Chris Buffa of GameDaily wrote: \"If you can't marry Brad Pitt, you can always settle for \"Mortal Kombat's\" Johnny Cage. GamesRadar considered Cage a combination of Jean-Claude Van Damme, Nicolas Cage, and Robert Downey, Jr. Writing for \"Complex\", Elton Jones declared that Cage \"embodies Hollywood's overpaid jerk persona perfectly,\" while Hanuman Welch considered Cage an exemplification of overconfidence and self-delusion, as well as a \"spokesperson of the obnoxious Ed Hardy crowd.\" Mark Walton of GameSpot castigated Cage in the 2011 reboot game as sexist and arrogant. Gavin Jasper of \"Den of Geek\" praised Linden Ashby’s performance in the first \"Mortal Kombat\" film as \"a perfect idea of\" Cage's personality. R. L. Shaffer of IGN was critical of Cage's \"illogical character arc\" as a former \"Power Rangers\" actor in the 2011 first season of \"Mortal Kombat: Legacy\", as he felt it was disconnected from Cage's role in the games, but Carl Lyon of Fearnet opined in his 2013 second-season review that Casper Van Dien's portrayal of the character made Cage \"the unlikable asshole we all know and love.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "25541697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25541697", "title": "Louie (U.S. TV series)", "text": "Louie (U.S. TV series)\n\nLouie is an American comedy-drama television series that premiered on FX on June 29, 2010. It is written, directed, created, edited, and produced by comedian Louis C.K., who also stars in the show as a fictionalized version of himself, a comedian and newly divorced father raising his two daughters in New York City. The show has a loose format atypical for television comedy series, consisting of largely unconnected storylines and segments (described by FX president John Landgraf as \"extended vignettes\") that revolve around Louie's life, punctuated by live stand-up performances.\n\nThe show has been met with critical acclaim and was included in various critics' TV show top-ten lists when it premiered in 2010. C.K. has received several Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his acting, writing, and directing and has won for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series at the 64th and 66th Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nAmid an \"extended hiatus\" for the show, FX ended their business partnership with Louis C.K.'s production company, Pig Newton, in November 2017, after he confirmed that a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him were true.\n\n\"Louie\" is loosely based on comedian Louis C.K.'s life, showing segments of him doing his stand-up routine onstage, and depicting his life offstage as a divorced father of two girls. Each episode features either two stories (which may or may not connect thematically) or a longer full-episode story (often consisting of numerous connected shorter pieces). The stories of all episodes revolve around Louie.\n\nThe pieces are interspersed with short clips of Louie's stand-up, usually performed in New York comedy clubs, mainly the Comedy Cellar and Carolines in Manhattan. The stand-up in the show consists of original material recorded for the series, and is usually shot from the stage rather than from the more traditional audience perspective. Sometimes these comedy segments are integrated into the stories themselves, whereas other times they simply serve to bookend them with a loosely connected topic. In the first season, blunt, socially awkward conversations between Louie and his therapist are also shown occasionally. Beginning in the third season, some episodes do not feature any stand-up performances or the opening credit sequence.\n\nEpisodes in the series have standalone plots, although some recurring roles (e.g. Louie's playdate friend Pamela, portrayed by Pamela Adlon, who was C.K.'s co-star in \"Lucky Louie\") occasionally provide story arc continuity between episodes. Continuity is not enforced; for example, Louie's mother has been portrayed in two very different ways. As C.K. explained, \"Every episode has its own goal, and if it messes up the goal of another episode, [...] I just don't care.\" Some stories also take place outside of the show's main time frame. For two examples, the episode \"God\" depicts Louie's childhood, and the episode \"Oh Louie\" shows the comedian 9 years earlier in his career. Beginning in the third season, \"Louie\" has moved toward story continuity within the season, and it includes multi-episode story arcs.\n\nThe pilot episode includes segments depicting a school field trip and an embarrassing first date, with subsequent episodes covering a diverse range of material, including divorce, sex, sexual orientation, depression, and Catholic guilt.\n\nC.K. serves as the show's lead and plays the only character who appears in every episode. \"Louie\" lacks a regular fixed cast, and instead features many guest appearances by stand-up comedians and actors. As a stand-up comedian in New York City, Louie's social circle on the show consists mainly of other comedians, and many notable comedians (such as Nick DiPaolo, Todd Barry, Jim Norton, Sarah Silverman, Chris Rock, and Jerry Seinfeld) have had recurring roles as fictionalized versions of themselves.\n\nMost episodes tend to focus on Louie's interactions with new characters. However, the show features a number of recurring characters, including Louie's two daughters, Lilly (Hadley Delany) and Jane (Ursula Parker); his brother Robbie (Robert Kelly); his teenage-looking agent Doug (Edward Gelbinovich); Pamela (Pamela Adlon), his best friend and love interest; Dr. Ben (Ricky Gervais), Louie's juvenile and arrogant doctor; Louie's therapist (David Patrick Kelly); and his ex-wife, Janet (Susan Kelechi Watson).\n\nSince \"Louie\" lacks continuity between episodes, supporting actors occasionally reappear in multiple roles, as is the case with William Stephenson, who appears as a bus driver in the pilot and as himself in \"Oh Louie/Tickets\"; Amy Landecker, who appears as Louie's date in \"Bully\" and as a young Louie's mother in \"God\" and \"In the Woods\"; and F. Murray Abraham, who plays a swinger in \"New Jersey/Airport\", Louie's uncle Excelsior in \"Dad\", and Louie's father in \"In the Woods\". Furthermore, Louie's mother and sisters have each been portrayed by multiple actresses, although his children have been consistently portrayed by Delany and Parker since the middle of the first season. His ex-wife is portrayed by Brooke Bloom in a flashback scene of \"Elevator Part 4\".\n\n\nSeason 1\n\nSeason 2\n\nSeason 3\n\nSeason 4\n\nSeason 5\n\nIn addition to these guest stars, several notable comedians have appeared in smaller roles, including Chris Gethard, Todd Glass, Ted Alexandro, Amir Blumenfeld, Eddie Brill, Joe DeRosa, Vernon Chatman, Artie Lange, Godfrey, Chelsea Peretti, JB Smoove, Dave Attell, Michael Cera, John Lithgow, Big Jay Oakerson, and Steven Wright. Opie & Anthony and Amy Schumer have had voice-only guest appearances.\n\nRather than accepting a bigger-budget production deal with a larger network, C.K. accepted the modest offer of $200,000 (covering his own fee as well as production costs) to do a pilot with FX, since FX allowed him full creative control. The show is shot on a Red camera setup, and C.K. edits many of the episodes on his personal MacBook Pro. In addition to starring, C.K. serves as the show's sole writer and director, an unusual combination in American TV production. Referring to John Landgraf, who convinced C.K. to accept a deal with FX, C.K. said: \n\nDave Becky also serves as executive producer. C.K. directed, cast, and edited the first episode of the show with a budget of $250,000, provided by FX. In the second season, the budget was increased to $300,000 per episode.\n\nProduction began in November 2009. C.K. said of his show, \"It's very vignette-y. It's very vérité. All those French words. I use 'em all.\" C.K.'s \"Lucky Louie\" co-star Pamela Adlon serves as consulting producer of the series.\n\nFor the third season, C.K. announced that he would be handing off some editing duties to longtime Woody Allen collaborator Susan E. Morse.\n\n\"Louie\" has received acclaim from critics. The stand-up segments received strong praise, as did the show's perceived \"indie film\" style, with some likening the show to the work of Woody Allen. Criticisms largely centered on the pacing and low-key delivery of the show's jokes, which often include long setups compared to the rapid-fire punchlines of a traditional sitcom.\n\nOf the \"top TV\" lists tracked by Metacritic, \"Louie\" appeared on 9 of 28 in 2010 and 22 of 39 in 2011, the latter of which includes 3 lists where the show was ranked 1st. On Metacritic, the first season scored 69 out of 100, based on 20 reviews. The second season scored 90 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\", based on 7 reviews. The third season received critical acclaim, scoring 94 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 16 reviews. The fourth season also received critical acclaim, scoring 93 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 30 reviews. The fifth season received acclaim as well, scoring 91 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 20 reviews.\n\nTelevision critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz ranked \"Louie\" as the 18th best American television show of all time in their book titled \"TV (The Book)\", stating that unlike other sitcoms which kept their tone and format the same throughout their respective runs, the series \"morphed from week to week, episode to episode, sometimes minute to minute. In doing so, it translated the thought-processes of stand-up comedy into cinematic terms, and in a way that was new to commercial television.\"\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released Season 1 on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in Region 1 on June 21, 2011. Season 2 was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in Region 1 on June 19, 2012. Seasons 3, 4, and 5 were exclusively released on DVD via Amazon.com's manufacture on demand program.\n\n\n"}

Between 1890 and 1893, she studied at the Chicago Art Institute, the Chicago School of Design (now also part of the Art Institute of Chicago), and the Chicago Business College. Lugenia Burns married John Hope in 1897 and moved with him to Atlanta when he joined the faculty of the Atlanta Baptist College (now Morehouse College); he was later appointed the institution's president in 1906. With the help of Morehouse students, she surveyed local area residents about their needs for community development projects, which eventually led to the college providing day care, kindergarten, and recreational programs. Her community involvement led her in 1908 to create the Neighborhood Union, the first woman-run social welfare agency for African Americans in Atlanta, which provided medical, recreational, employment, and educational services and became known for its community building and race and gender activism. Hope served as head of its Board of Managers until 1936.\n\nBecause only white soldiers were served by the United Service Organization's entertainment programs in World War II, the Neighborhood Union ran YWCA War Work Councils to provide similar services to the Black community. Their success led to Lugenia Hope coordinating a US-wide network of Hostess Houses that provided services ranging from recreational programs to relocation counseling to black and Jewish soldiers and their families.\n\nA founding member of the Atlanta branch of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs, Hope became involved in reform activities nationwide, such as her 1920 effort to end segregation and white-domination within the national YWCA. Her statement to white women who opposed full equality in the YWCA for African-American women was: \"Ignorance is ignorance wherever found, yet the most ignorant white woman may enjoy every privilege that America offers. Now ...the ignorant Negro woman should also enjoy them.\"\n\nAn innovative thinker on racial politics, Hope criticized the common belief that black Americans needed to prove their worthiness as citizens, and as vice president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People of Atlanta organized six-week courses on voting, democracy, and the U.S. Constitution. This work was later copied across the country, and these classes became part of the early stages of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nLugenia Burns Hope became ill in 1936, the year her husband died, and spent the rest of her life in New York City, Chicago, and Nashville. Hope died August 14, 1947, in Nashville, Tennessee\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1605735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1605735", "title": "Mass communication", "text": "Mass communication\n\nMass communication is the study of how people exchange their information through mass media to large segments of the population at the same time with an amazing speed. In other words, mass communication refers to the imparting and exchanging of information on a large scale to a wide range of people. It is usually understood for relating newspaper, magazine, and book publishing, as well as radio, television and film, even via internet as these mediums are used for disseminating information, news and advertising. Mass communication differs from the studies of other forms of communication, such as interpersonal communication or organizational communication, in that it focuses on a single source transmitting information to a large number of receivers. The study of mass communication is chiefly concerned with how the content of mass communication persuades or otherwise affects the behavior, the attitude, opinion, or emotion of the person or people receiving the information.\n\nDefinition of mass communication։\n\nNormally, transmission of messages to many persons at a time is called Mass Communication. But in complete sense, mass communication can be defined as the process through which a message is circulated extensively among people nearby & also throughout far extending areas such as entire countries or the globe.\n\nWhat is Mass Communication?\n\n\nMass communication is \"the process by which a person, group of people, or organization creates a message and transmits it through some type of medium to a large, anonymous, heterogeneous audience.\" This implies that the audience of mass communication are mostly made up of different cultures, behavior and belief systems. Mass communication is regularly associated with media influence or media effects, and media studies. Mass communication is a branch of social science and a subfield of communication studies or communication.\n\nThe history of communication stretches from prehistoric forms of art and writing through modern communication methods such as the Internet. Mass communication began when humans could transmit messages from a single source to multiple receivers. Mass communication has moved from theories such as the hypodermic needle model (or magic bullet theory) through more modern theories such as computer-mediated communication.\n\nIn the United States, the study of mass communication is often associated with the practical applications of journalism (Print media), television and radio broadcasting, film, public relations, or advertising. With the diversification of media options, the study of communication has extended to include social media and new media, which have stronger feedback models than traditional media sources. While the field of mass communication is continually evolving, the following four fields are generally considered the major areas of study within mass communication. They exist in different forms and configurations at different schools or universities, but are (in some form) practiced at most institutions that study mass communication. Advertising, in relation to mass communication, refers to marketing a product or service in a persuasive manner that encourages the audience to buy the product or use the service. Because advertising generally takes place through some form of mass media, such as television, studying the effects and methods of advertising is relevant to the study of mass communication. Advertising is the paid, impersonal, one-way marketing of persuasive information from a sponsor. Through mass communication channels, the sponsor promotes the adoption of goods, services or ideas. Advertisers have full control of the message being sent to their audience.\n\nCharacteristics or Features of Mass Communication\nMass Communication has all the features of general communication. In addition, it offers some unique characteristics because of its specialty in nature. \n\nLarge Number of Audience\n\nThe foremost feature of mass communication is that it has large number of audience. No other communication gets as many receivers as it gets.\nHeterogeneous Audience\nMass Communication is not only composed of a large number of audiences but also aims to heterogeneous audience. The heterogeneity here means that the audience may belong to different races, groups, section, cultures etc.\nScattered Audience\nThe audiences of Mass Communication are not organized in a certain area rather they are highly scattered in different geographical areas. The receivers of message of mass communication may stay any place of the country and even any place of the world.\n\nWide Area\nThe area of Mass Communication is wider than any other communication systems. In case of mass communication system, the message is structured, formal and standardized and that’s why it has acceptance all over the world.\nUse of Channel\nMass Communication system uses various types of mass media channels such as-radio, television, newspapers, magazines etc.\nUse of Common Message\nAnother unique characteristic of mass communication is that it sends the same message simultaneously to a large number of audiences staying far away from each other. If the audiences have the proper access to the media used by the sender they can easily get message wherever they stay in the world.\nNo Direct Feedback\nMass Communication does not produce any direct feedback. The reaction of audience cannot be known quickly here.\nOutward Flow\nThe flow of message in mass communication is outward, not inward. The basic objective of mass communication is also to send message to the people outside the organization who say far away.\nUse of Technology\nMass Communication system uses modern technology in the process of production and dissemination of the message to be sent.\n\nJournalism, is the collection, verification, presentation, and editing of news for presentation through the media, in this sense, refers to the study of the product and production of news. The study of journalism involves looking at how news is produced, and how it is disseminated to the public through mass media outlets such as newspapers, news channel, radio station, television station, and more recently, e-readers and smartphones. The information provided pertains to current events, trends, issues, and people.\n\nPublic relations is the process of providing information to the public in order to present a specific view of a product or organization. Public relations differs from advertising in that it is less obtrusive, and aimed at providing a more comprehensive opinion to a large audience in order to shape public opinion. Unlike advertising, public relations professionals only have control until the message is related to media gatekeepers who decide where to pass the information on to the audience.\n\nCommunication researchers have identified several major theories associated with the study of mass communication. Communication theory addresses the processes and mechanisms that allow communication to take place.\n\n\nCommunication researchers study communication through various methods that have been verified through repetitive, cumulative processes. Both quantitative and qualitative methods have been used in the study of mass communication. The main focus of mass communication research is to learn how the content of mass communication affects the attitudes, opinions, emotions, and ultimately behaviors of the people who receive the message. Several prominent methods of study are as follows:\n\n\nThe Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication is the major membership organization for academics in the field, offering regional and national conferences and refereed publications. The International Communication Association and National Communication Association (formerly the Speech Communication Association) are also prominent professional organizations. Each of these organizations publishes a different refereed academic journal that reflects the research that is being performed in the field of mass communication.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20429006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20429006", "title": "Norwegian art", "text": "Norwegian art\n\nFor much of its history Norwegian art is usually considered as part of the wider Nordic art of Scandinavia. It has, especially since about 1100, been strongly influenced by wider trends in European art. After World War II, the influence of the United States strengthened substantially. Due to generous art subsidies, contemporary Norwegian art has a high production per capita.\n\nThough usually not especially a major centre for art production or exporter of art, Norway has been relatively successful in keeping its art; in particular, the relatively mild nature of the Norwegian Reformation, and the lack of subsequent extensive rebuilding and redecoration of churches, has meant that with other Scandinavian countries, Norway has unusually rich survivals of medieval church paintings and fittings. One period when Nordic art exerted a strong influence over the rest of northern Europe was in Viking art, and there are many survivals, both in stone monuments left untouched around the countryside, and objects excavated in modern times.\n\nThe Reformation and the loss of a permanent royal court after the Kalmar Union of 1397 greatly disrupted Norwegian artistic traditions, and left the existing body of painters and sculptors without large markets. The requirements of the small aristocratic class were mainly for portraits, usually by imported artists, and it was not until the 19th century that significant numbers of Norwegians were trained in contemporary styles. \n\nNorwegian art came into its own in the 19th century, especially with the early landscape painters. Until that time, the art scene in Norway had been dominated by imports from Germany and Holland and by the influence of Danish rule. Initially with landscape painting, later with Impressionism and Realism. Though for the rest of the world Edvard Munch (1863–1944) is certainly Norway's great artistic figure, there have been many other significant figures.\n\nJohan Christian Dahl (1788–1857) is often said to be the \"father of Norwegian landscape painting\". After a period in Copenhagen, he joined the Dresden school to which he made an important contribution. He eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time.\n\nAnother important early contributor was Johannes Flintoe (1787–1870), a Danish-Norwegian painter, known for his Norwegian landscapes and paintings of folk costumes. He taught at the School of Drawing (\"Tegneskolen\") in Christiania from 1819 to 1851 where his students included budding romanticists such as Hans Gude and Johan F. Eckersberg.\n\nAdolph Tidemand (1814–1876) studied in Copenhagen, in Italy and finally in Düsseldorf where he settled. He often returned to Norway where he painted the old Norwegian farm culture. His best known painting is \"The bridal procession in Hardanger\" (together with Hans Gude, 1848) and \"Haugianerne\" (\"Haugeans\") painted in 1852.\n\nNorway’s new-found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as Kitty Kielland, 1843–1914, an early female painter who studied under Gude and Harriet Backer, 1845–1932, another pioneer among female artists, influenced by impressionism.\n\nFrits Thaulow, 1847–1906, an impressionist, was initially a student of Hans Gude. He was later influenced by the art scene in Paris where he developed impressionist talents. Returning to Norway in 1880, he became one of the leading figures on the Norwegian art scene, together with Christian Krohg and Erik Werenskiold.\n\nChristian Krohg, 1852–1925, a realist painter, was also influenced by the Paris scene. He is remembered for his paintings of prostitutes which caused something of a scandal.\n\nThorolf Holmboe (1866–1935) studied under Hans Gude in Berlin between 1886 and 1887 and Fernand Cormon in Paris between 1889 and 1891. He was inspired by many different styles at different points in his career, including Naturalism, Neo-romanticism, Realism and Impressionism.\n\nNikolai Astrup (1880–1928) grew up in Jølster in the west of Norway. After studying art in Oslo and spending some time in Paris and in Germany, he returned to Jølster where he specialised in painting expressionist landscapes with clear, strong colors. He is considered to be one of the greatest Norwegian artists from the early 20th century.\n\nLars Hertervig (1830–1902) from Tysvær in south-western Norway painted semi-fantastical works inspired by the coastal landscape in Ryfylke. Hertervig completed a number of works on paper using aquarelles and often making the paper base himself from scrapes of discarded pieces of paper. The art museum under the main museum, Stavanger Museum, in Stavanger, Rogaland (previously Rogaland Museum of Fine Art) has the most significant collection of works by Hertervig in Norway. \n\nHarald Sohlberg, (1869–1935), a neo-romanticist, is remembered for his paintings of Røros, and the Norwegian \"national painting\" \"Winter's Night in Rondane\".\n\nNorway's most famous artist is certainly Edvard Munch (1863–1944), a symbolist/expressionist who became world-famous for \"The Scream\", one of the most recognizable paintings in all art.

Each story, told from the perspective of Beth herself or one of the people around her, explores a different period of her troubled life.\n\nIn a 2007 interview with \"Time Out Chicago\", Wycoff said that the stories were based on the \"political truth\" that \"single mothers fall through the cracks in this country, and the cracks grow in proportion to these women's economic challenges, making inaccessible the so-called American Dream\". She explained that, though she drew on her own experiences as a single mother, the stories were not autobiographical.\n\nMichael Upchurch of \"The Seattle Times\" wrote that the book recognizes \"how even the most toxic family connections have some kind of love threaded through them\", and notes that \"its heroine, even in the worst circumstances, keeps fierce hold of her dignity\". He added:\nCiting author Cris Mazza as her creative muse and mentor, Wycoff noted, \"she helped me see that the disparate single-mother stories I’d written could be linked.” Wycoff explained, \"In a linked-story format, I can present other points of view as short pieces of contrast. I wanted to structure the book so that it begins and ends with a death, because I wanted it to read as a cycle. Linearity, to me, seems more of a construct than cycles.\" She told \"Time Out Chicago\", \"The second [story] I wrote when my son was two years old. I wrote it, in part, in reaction to all of the sentimental, dreamy writing about motherhood.\" Noting that most writing about motherhood is \"so ebullient and romantic\", Wycoff told \"The Stranger\" that \"there are a lot of mothers out there who don't feel that way about motherhood at all.\"\n\nWhile seeking a publisher for \"O Street\", Wycoff said, \"I got about seven rejections over the course of four years, all from small presses, many of whom called the collection 'too dark'.\" Picked up by small publisher OV Books, the book's title was initially announced as \"The Wrong Place in the World\", the title of the first story. \"O Street\" is also the title of a story in the collection.\n\nThree of the stories have been published previously: \"Afterbirth\" (in \"New Letters\"), \"The Shell Game\" (in \"Coal City Review\"), and \"O Street\" (in \"Other Voices\" magazine). \"Afterbirth\" and \"Visiting Mrs. Ferullo\" won the second annual Heartland Short Fiction Prize in 1999. \"Afterbirth\" was also excerpted in \"Oregon Quarterly\" in Spring 2007 in conjunction with the book's release.\n\nUpchurch wrote of \"O Street\", \"This is one grim, tough, upsetting book. Yet it’s also shot through with a painful radiance and level intelligence that keep you with it every step of the way.\" He praised Wycoff's \"sharp ear for how speech can signal a gulf between social realities impossible to bridge\". \"Publishers Weekly\" called the collection \"a straightforward look at pain and renewal\".\n\nDavid Bradley praised the book:\nDescribing the collection as \"\"White Oleander\" blown into \"A Million Little Pieces\"\", Cris Mazza wrote, \"Stripped of sentimentality and sanguinity, Corrina Wycoff ’s \"O Street\" is a relentless stare into the dark yawn of brutality.\" Alex Shakar praised it as \"deeply moving, deftly told, and keenly insightful\", and Aimee Liu called it \"a harrowing portrait of familial pain, mental illness, and the sometimes cruel tenacity of love\".

{"id": "87770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87770", "title": "Oedipus Rex", "text": "Oedipus Rex\n\nOedipus Rex, also known by its Greek title, Oedipus Tyrannus ( IPA: [oidípuːs týranːos]), or Oedipus the King, is an Athenian tragedy by Sophocles that was first performed around 429 BC. Originally, to the ancient Greeks, the title was simply \"Oedipus\" (\"Οἰδίπους\"), as it is referred to by Aristotle in the \"Poetics\". It is thought to have been renamed \"Oedipus Tyrannus\" to distinguish it from another of Sophocles' plays, \"Oedipus at Colonus\". In antiquity, the term “tyrant” referred to a ruler, but it did not necessarily have a negative connotation.\n\nOf his three Theban plays that have survived, and that deal with the story of Oedipus, \"Oedipus Rex\" was the second to be written. However, in terms of the chronology of events that the plays describe, it comes first, followed by \"Oedipus at Colonus\" and then \"Antigone\".\n\nPrior to the start of \"Oedipus Rex\", Oedipus has become the king of Thebes while unwittingly fulfilling a prophecy that he would kill his father, Laius (the previous king), and marry his mother, Jocasta (whom Oedipus took as his queen after solving the riddle of the Sphinx). The action of Sophocles' play concerns Oedipus' search for the murderer of Laius in order to end a plague ravaging Thebes, unaware that the killer he is looking for is none other than himself. At the end of the play, after the truth finally comes to light, Jocasta hangs herself while Oedipus, horrified at his patricide and incest, proceeds to gouge out his own eyes in despair.\n\n\"Oedipus Rex\" is regarded by many scholars as the masterpiece of ancient Greek tragedy. In his \"Poetics\", Aristotle refers several times to the play in order to exemplify aspects of the genre.\n\nMany parts or elements of the myth of Oedipus occur before the opening scene of the play, although some are alluded to in the text. Oedipus is the son of Laius and Jocasta, the king and queen of Thebes. The misfortunes of his house are the result of a curse laid upon his father for violating the sacred laws of hospitality. In his youth, Laius was the guest of Pelops, the king of Elis, and he became the tutor of Chrysippus, the king's youngest son, in chariot racing. Laius seduced or abducted and raped Chrysippus, who according to some versions, killed himself in shame. This murder cast a doom over Laius and all of his descendants (although many scholars regard Laius' transgressions against Chrysippus to be a late addition to the myth).\n\nWhen his son is born, the king consults an oracle as to his fortune. To his horror, the oracle reveals that Laius \"is doomed to perish by the hand of his own son\". Laius binds the infant's feet together with a pin, and orders Jocasta to kill him. Unable to kill her own son, Jocasta orders a servant to slay the infant for her. The servant then exposes the infant on a mountaintop, where he is found and rescued by a shepherd (in some versions, the servant gives the infant to the shepherd). The shepherd names the child Oedipus, \"swollen feet\", as his feet had been tightly bound by Laius. The shepherd brings the infant to Corinth, and presents him to the childless king Polybus, who raises Oedipus as his own son.\n\nAs he grows to manhood, Oedipus hears a rumour that he is not truly the son of Polybus and his wife, Merope. He asks the Delphic Oracle who his parents really are. The Oracle seems to ignore this question, telling him instead that he is destined to \"\"mate with [his] own mother, and shed/With [his] own hands the blood of [his] own sire\". Desperate to avoid this terrible fate, Oedipus, who still believes that Polybus and Merope are his true parents, leaves Corinth for the city of Thebes.\n\nOn the road to Thebes, Oedipus encounters Laius and his retainers, and the two quarrel over whose chariot has the right of way. The Theban king moves to strike the insolent youth with his sceptre, but Oedipus, unaware that Laius is his true father, throws the old man down from his chariot, killing him. Thus, Laius is slain by his own son, and the prophecy that the king had sought to avoid by exposing Oedipus at birth is fulfilled.\n\nBefore arriving at Thebes, Oedipus encounters the Sphinx, a legendary beast with the head and breast of a woman, the body of a lioness, and the wings of an eagle. The Sphinx was sent to the road approaching Thebes as a punishment from the gods, and would strangle any traveler who failed to answer a certain riddle. The precise riddle asked by the Sphinx varied in early traditions, and is not stated in \"Oedipus Rex\", as the event precedes the play; but the most widely-known version is, \"what is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three in the evening?\" Oedipus correctly guesses, \"man\"\", who crawls on all fours as an infant, walks upright in maturity, and leans on a stick in old age. Bested by the prince, the Sphinx throws herself from a cliff, thereby ending the curse. Oedipus' reward for freeing Thebes from the Sphinx is its kingship, and the hand of the dowager queen, Jocasta; none then realize that Jocasta is Oedipus' true mother. Thus, unknown to all of the characters, the prophecy has been fulfilled.\n\nOedipus, King of Thebes, sends his brother-in-law, Creon, to ask advice of the oracle at Delphi, concerning a plague ravaging Thebes. Creon returns to report that the plague is the result of religious pollution, since the murderer of their former king, Laius, has never been caught. Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for causing the plague.\n\nOedipus summons the blind prophet Tiresias for help. When Tiresias arrives he claims to know the answers to Oedipus's questions, but refuses to speak, instead telling him to abandon his search. Oedipus is enraged by Tiresias' refusal, and verbally accuses him of complicity in Laius' murder. Outraged, Tiresias tells the king that Oedipus himself is the murderer (\"You yourself are the criminal you seek\"). Oedipus cannot see how this could be, and concludes that the prophet must have been paid off by Creon in an attempt to undermine him. The two argue vehemently, as Oedipus mocks Tiresias' lack of sight, and Tiresias in turn tells Oedipus that he himself is blind. Eventually Tiresias leaves, muttering darkly that when the murderer is discovered he shall be a native citizen of Thebes, brother and father to his own children, and son and husband to his own mother.\n\nCreon arrives to face Oedipus's accusations. The King demands that Creon be executed; however, the chorus persuades him to let Creon live. Jocasta enters and attempts to comfort Oedipus, telling him he should take no notice of prophets. As proof, she recounts an incident in which she and Laius received an oracle which never came true. The prophecy stated that Laius would be killed by his own son; however, Jocasta reassures Oedipus by her statement that Laius was killed by bandits at a crossroads on the way to Delphi.\n\nThe mention of this crossroads causes Oedipus to pause and ask for more details. He asks Jocasta what Laius looked like, and Oedipus suddenly becomes worried that Tiresias's accusations were true. Oedipus then sends for the one surviving witness of the attack to be brought to the palace from the fields where he now works as a shepherd.\n\nJocasta, confused, asks Oedipus what the matter is, and he tells her. Many years ago, at a banquet in Corinth, a man drunkenly accused Oedipus of not being his father's son. Oedipus went to Delphi and asked the oracle about his parentage. Instead of answers he was given a prophecy that he would one day murder his father and sleep with his mother. Upon hearing this he resolved to leave Corinth and never return. While traveling he came to the very crossroads where Laius was killed, and encountered a carriage which attempted to drive him off the road. An argument ensued and Oedipus killed the travelers, including a man who matches Jocasta's description of Laius. Oedipus has hope, however, because the story is that Laius was murdered by \"several\" robbers. If the shepherd confirms that Laius was attacked by many men, then Oedipus is in the clear.\n\nA man arrives from Corinth with the message that Oedipus's father has died. Oedipus, to the surprise of the messenger, is made ecstatic by this news, for it proves one half of the prophecy false, for now he can never kill his father. However, he still fears that he may somehow commit incest with his mother. The messenger, eager to ease Oedipus's mind, tells him not to worry, because Merope was not in fact his real mother.\n\nIt emerges that this messenger was formerly a shepherd on Mount Cithaeron, and that he was given a baby, which the childless Polybus then adopted. The baby, he says, was given to him by another shepherd from the Laius household, who had been told to get rid of the child. Oedipus asks the chorus if anyone knows who this man was, or where he might be now. They respond that he is the \"same shepherd\" who was witness to the murder of Laius, and whom Oedipus had already sent for. Jocasta, who has by now realized the truth, desperately begs Oedipus to stop asking questions, but he refuses and Jocasta runs into the palace.\n\nWhen the shepherd arrives Oedipus questions him, but he begs to be allowed to leave without answering further. However, Oedipus presses him, finally threatening him with torture or execution. It emerges that the child he gave away was Laius's own son, and that Jocasta had given the baby to the shepherd to secretly be exposed upon the mountainside. This was done in fear of the prophecy that Jocasta said had never come true: that the child would kill his father.\n\nEverything is at last revealed, and Oedipus curses himself and fate before leaving the stage. The chorus laments how even a great man can be felled by fate, and following this, a servant exits the palace to speak of what has happened inside. When Jocasta enters the house, she runs to the palace bedroom and hangs herself there. Shortly afterward, Oedipus enters in a fury, calling on his servants to bring him a sword so that he might cut out his mother's womb. He then rages through the house, until he comes upon Jocasta's body. Giving a cry, Oedipus takes her down and removes the long gold pins that held her dress together, before plunging them into his own eyes in despair.\n\nA blind Oedipus now exits the palace and begs to be exiled as soon as possible. Creon enters, saying that Oedipus shall be taken into the house until oracles can be consulted regarding what is best to be done. Oedipus's two daughters (and half-sisters), Antigone and Ismene, are sent out, and Oedipus laments their having been born to such a cursed family. He asks Creon to watch over them and Creon agrees, before sending Oedipus back into the palace.\n\nOn an empty stage the chorus repeat the common Greek maxim, that no man should be considered fortunate until he is dead.\n\nThe two cities of Troy and Thebes were the major focus of Greek epic poetry. The events surrounding the Trojan War were chronicled in the Epic Cycle, of which much remains, and those about Thebes in the Theban Cycle, which have been lost. The Theban Cycle recounted the sequence of tragedies that befell the house of Laius, of which the story of Oedipus is a part.\n\nHomer's \"Odyssey\" (XI.271ff.) contains the earliest account of the Oedipus myth when Odysseus encounters Jocasta (named Epicaste) in the underworld. Homer briefly summarises the story of Oedipus, including the incest, patricide, and Jocasta's subsequent suicide. However, in the Homeric version, Oedipus remains King of Thebes after the revelation and neither blinds himself, nor is sent into exile. In particular, it is said that the gods made the matter of his paternity known, whilst in \"Oedipus the King\", Oedipus very much discovers the truth himself.\n\nIn 467 BC, Sophocles's fellow tragedian Aeschylus won first prize at the City Dionysia with a trilogy about the House of Laius, comprising \"Laius\", \"Oedipus\" and \"Seven against Thebes\" (the only play which survives). Since he did not write connected trilogies as Aeschylus did, \"Oedipus Rex\" focuses on the titular character while hinting at the larger myth obliquely, which was already known to the audience in Athens at the time.\n\nThe trilogy containing \"Oedipus Rex\" took second prize in the City Dionysia at its original performance. Aeschylus's nephew Philocles took first prize at that competition. However, in his \"Poetics\", Aristotle considered \"Oedipus Rex\" to be the tragedy which best matched his prescription for how drama should be made.\n\nMany modern critics agree with Aristotle on the quality of \"Oedipus Rex\", even if they don't always agree on the reasons. For example, Richard Claverhouse Jebb claimed that \"The \"Oedipus Tyrannus\" is in one sense the masterpiece of Attic tragedy. No other shows an equal degree of art in the development of the plot; and this excellence depends on the powerful and subtle drawing of the characters.\" Cedric Whitman noted that \"the \"Oedipus Rex\" passes almost universally for the greatest extant Greek play...\" Whitman himself regarded the play as \"the fullest expression of this conception of tragedy,\" that is the conception of tragedy as a \"revelation of the evil lot of man,\" where a man may have \"all the equipment for glory and honor\" but still have \"the greatest effort to do good\" end in \"the evil of an unbearable self for which one is not responsible. Edith Hall referred to \"Oedipus the King\" as \"this definitive tragedy\" and notes that \"the magisterial subtlety of Sophocles' characterization thus lend credibility to the breathtaking coincidences,\" and notes the irony that \"Oedipus can only fulfill his exceptional god-ordained destiny because Oedipus is a preeminently capable and intelligent human being.\" H. D. F. Kitto said about \"Oedipus Rex\" that \"it is true to say that the perfection of its form implies a world order,\" although Kitto notes that whether or not that world order \"is beneficent, Sophocles does not say.\"\n\nThe science revolution attributed to Thales began gaining political force, and this play offered a warning to the new thinkers. Kitto interprets the play as Sophocles' retort to the sophists, by dramatizing a situation in which humans face undeserved suffering through no fault of their own, but despite the apparent randomness of the events, the fact that they have been prophesied by the gods implies that the events are not random, despite the reasons being beyond human comprehension. Through the play, according to Kitto, Sophocles declares \"that it is wrong, in the face of the incomprehensible and unmoral, to deny the moral laws and accept chaos. What is right is to recognize facts and not delude ourselves. The universe is a unity; if, sometimes, we can see neither rhyme nor reason in it we should not suppose it is random. There is so much that we cannot know and cannot control that we should not think and behave as if we do know and can control.\n\nFate is a theme that often occurs in Greek writing, tragedies in particular. The idea that attempting to avoid an oracle is the very thing which brings it about is a common motif in many Greek myths, and similarities to Oedipus can for example be seen in the myth of the birth of Perseus.\n\nTwo oracles in particular dominate the plot of \"Oedipus Rex\". In lines 711 to 714, Jocasta relates the prophecy that was told to Laius before the birth of Oedipus. Namely:\n\"(The oracle) told him\"\n\"that it was his fate that he should die a victim\"\n\"at the hands of his own son, a son to be born\"\n\"of Laius and me.\"\nThe oracle told to Laius tells only of the patricide; the incest is missing. Prompted by Jocasta's recollection, Oedipus reveals the prophecy which caused him to leave Corinth (791-93):\n\"that I was fated to lie with my mother,\"\n\"and show to daylight an accursed breed\"\n\"which men would not endure, and I was doomed\"\n\"to be murderer of the father that begot me.\"\nThe implication of Laius's oracle is ambiguous. One interpretation considers that the presentation of Laius's oracle in this play differs from that found in Aeschylus's Oedipus trilogy produced in 467 BC. Helaine Smith argues:\n\nSophocles had the option of making the oracle to Laius conditional (\"if\" Laius has a son, that son will kill him) or unconditional (Laius \"will\" have a son who will kill him). Both Aeschylus and Euripides write plays in which the oracle is conditional; Sophocles ... chooses to make Laius's oracle unconditional and thus removes culpability for his sins\nfrom Oedipus, for he could not have done other than what he did, no matter what action he took.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by Jocasta's repetition of the oracle at lines 854–55: \"Loxias declared that the king should be killed by/ his own son.\" In the Greek, Jocasta uses the verb \"chrênai\": \"to be fated, necessary.\" This iteration of the oracle seems to suggest that it was unconditional and inevitable. Other scholars have nonetheless argued that Sophocles follows tradition in making Laius's oracle conditional, and thus avoidable. They point to Jocasta's initial disclosure of the oracle at lines 711–14. In the Greek, the oracle cautions: \"hôs auton hexoi moira pros paidos thanein\"/ \"hostis genoit\" \"emou te kakeinou para\". The two verbs in boldface indicate what is called a \"future more vivid\" condition: \"if\" a child is born to Laius, his fate to be killed by that child \"will\" overtake him.\n\nWhatever the meaning of Laius's oracle, the one delivered to Oedipus is clearly unconditional. Given our modern conception of fate and fatalism, readers of the play have a tendency to view Oedipus as a mere puppet controlled by greater forces, a man crushed by the gods and fate for no good reason. This, however, is not an entirely accurate reading. While it is a mythological truism that oracles exist to be fulfilled, oracles do not cause the events that lead up to the outcome. In his landmark essay \"On Misunderstanding the \"Oedipus Rex\"\", E.R. Dodds draws a comparison with Jesus's prophecy at the Last Supper that Peter would deny him three times. Jesus \"knows\" that Peter will do this, but readers would in no way suggest that Peter was a puppet of fate being \"forced\" to deny Christ. Free will and predestination are by no means mutually exclusive, and such is the case with Oedipus.\n\nThe oracle delivered to Oedipus what is often called a \"self-fulfilling prophecy\", in that the prophecy itself sets in motion events that conclude with its own fulfilment. This, however, is not to say that Oedipus is a victim of fate and has no free will. The oracle inspires a series of specific choices, freely made by Oedipus, which lead him to kill his father and marry his mother. Oedipus \"chooses\" not to return to Corinth after hearing the oracle, just as he chooses to head toward Thebes, to kill Laius, to marry and to take Jocasta specifically as his bride; in response to the plague at Thebes, he \"chooses\" to send Creon to the Oracle for advice and then to follow that advice, initiating the investigation into Laius's murder. None of these choices are predetermined.\nAnother characteristic of oracles in myth is that they are almost always misunderstood by those who hear them; hence Oedipus's misunderstanding the significance of the Delphic Oracle. He visits Delphi to find out who his real parents are and assumes that the Oracle refuses to answer that question, offering instead an unrelated prophecy which forecasts patricide and incest. Oedipus's assumption is incorrect, the Oracle does, in a way, answer his question:\n\n\"On closer analysis the oracle contains essential information which Oedipus seems to neglect.\" The wording of the Oracle: I was doomed to be murderer of the father that begot me refers to Oedipus' real, biological father. Likewise the mother with polluted children is defined as the biological one. The wording of the drunken guest on the other hand: you are not your father's son defines Polybus as only a foster father to Oedipus. The two wordings support each other and point to the \"two set of parents\" alternative. Thus the question of two set of parents, biological and foster, is raised. Oedipus's reaction to the Oracle is irrational: he states he did not get any answer and he flees in a direction away from Corinth, showing that he firmly believed at the time that Polybus and Merope are his real parents.\n\n\"The scene with the drunken guest constitutes the end of Oedipus' childhood. … he can no longer ignore a feeling of uncertainty about his parentage. However, after consulting the Oracle this uncertainty disappears, strangely enough, and is replaced by a totally unjustified certainty that he is the son of Merope and Polybus. We have said that this irrational behaviour - his hamartia in Aristotle's sense - is due to the repression of a whole series of thoughts in his consciousness, in fact everything that referred to his earlier doubts about his parentage.\n\nThe exploration of this theme in \"Oedipus Rex\" is paralleled by the examination of the conflict between the individual and the state in \"Antigone\". The dilemma that Oedipus faces here is similar to that of the tyrannical Creon: each man has, as king, made a decision that his subjects question or disobey; each king also misconstrues both his own role as a sovereign and the role of the rebel. When informed by the blind prophet Tiresias that religious forces are against him, each king claims that the priest has been corrupted. It is here, however, that their similarities come to an end: while Creon, seeing the havoc he has wreaked, tries to amend his mistakes, Oedipus refuses to listen to anyone.\n\nLiteral and metaphorical references to eyesight appear throughout \"Oedipus Rex\". Clear vision serves as a metaphor for insight and knowledge, but the clear-eyed Oedipus is blind to the truth about his origins and inadvertent crimes. The prophet Tiresias, on the other hand, although literally blind, \"sees\" the truth and relays what is revealed to him. \"Though Oedipus' future is predicted by the gods, even after being warned by Tiresias, he \"cannot\" see the truth or reality beforehand because his excessive pride has blinded his vision…\" Only after Oedipus has physically blinded himself does he gain a limited prophetic ability, as seen in \"Oedipus at Colonus\". It is deliberately ironic that the \"seer\" can \"see\" better than Oedipus, despite being blind. In one line (Oedipus the king, 469), Tiresias says:\n\n\"So, you mock my blindness? Let me tell you this. You [Oedipus] with your precious eyes, you're blind to the corruption of your life ...\" (Robert Fagles 1984)\n\nSigmund Freud in \"Interpretation of Dreams\" wrote a notable passage regarding of the destiny of Oedipus as well as the Oedipus complex. He analyzes why this play, \"Oedipus Rex\", written in Ancient Greece, is so effective even to a modern audience. Freud says,\n\nHis destiny moves us only because it might have been ours — because the oracle laid the same curse upon us before our birth as upon him. It is the fate of all of us, perhaps, to direct our first sexual impulse towards our mother and our first hatred and our first murderous wish against our father. Our dreams convince us that this is so.”\n\nIn the same book, Freud indicates, however, that the “primordial urges and fears” that are his concern are not found primarily in the play by Sophocles, but exist in the myth the play is based on; he refers to the play as a “further modification of the legend”, one that originates in a “misconceived secondary revision of the material, which has sought to exploit it for theological purposes.”\n\nThe play has been filmed several times, twice in English.\n\nThe 1957 film version, directed by Tyrone Guthrie, starred Douglas Campbell as Oedipus and had the cast performing the entire play in masks, as in ancient Greek theatre.\n\nThe second English language film version, directed by Philip Saville and released in 1968, was filmed in Greece. This one showed the actors' faces and boasted an all-star cast, including Christopher Plummer as Oedipus, Lilli Palmer as Jocasta, Orson Welles as Tiresias, Richard Johnson as Creon, Roger Livesey as the Shepherd, and Donald Sutherland as the Leading Member of the Chorus. Sutherland's voice, however, was dubbed by another actor. The film went a step further than the play, however, by actually showing, in flashback, the murder of Laius (Friedrich Ledebur). It also showed Oedipus and Jocasta in bed together, making love. Made in 1968, this film was not seen in Europe and the U.S. until the 1970s and 1980s after legal release and distribution rights were granted to video and TV.\n\nIn 1967 Pier Paolo Pasolini directed \"Edipo Re\", a modern interpretation of the play. Toshio Matsumoto's 1969 film, \"Funeral Parade of Roses\", is a loose adaptation of the play and an important work of the Japanese New Wave. In Colombia, writer Gabriel García Márquez adapted the story in \"Edipo Alcalde\", bringing it to the real Colombian situation.\n\nComposer Igor Stravinsky wrote an opera/oratorio version of Oedipus rex (opera), premiered in 1927 by the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, Paris. It is scored for orchestra, speaker, soloists, and male chorus. The libretto, based on Sophocles's tragedy, was written by Jean Cocteau in French and then translated by Abbé Jean Daniélou into Latin; the narration, however, is performed in the language of the audience.\n\nOedipus rex was written towards the beginning of Stravinsky's neoclassical period, and is considered one of the finest works from this phase of the composer's career. He had considered setting the work in Ancient Greek, but decided ultimately on Latin: in his words \"a medium not dead but turned to stone.\"\n\nMichael Pennington starred as Oedipus with Claire Bloom as Jocasta, Sir John Gielgud as Tiresias and John Shrapnel as Creon in Don Taylor's 1986 translation/adaptation of the play, which formed part of the BBC's \"The Theban Plays\" trilogy.\n\nIn 1977, CBS Radio Mystery Theater broadcast a version of the story called \"So Shall Ye Reap\", set in what was then the US Territory of New Mexico in 1851.\n\nOther television Oedipus's include Christopher Plummer (1957), Ian Holm (1972) and Patrick Stewart (1977).\n\nIn 2017, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a production of Anthony Burgess' translation of the play with Christopher Eccleston as Oedipus and Fiona Shaw as Tiresias/Second Elder. John Shrapnel, who starred as Creon in the 1986 BBC television version, played The First Elder.\n\nChrysanthos Mentis Bostantzoglou makes a parody of this tragedy in his comedy \"Medea\" (1993).\n\nIn episode ten of the second season of '\"CNNNN\"', an Australian satirical television program made by The Chaser, a short animation in the style of a Disney movie trailer, complete with jaunty music provided by Andrew Hansen, parodies \"Oedipus Rex\". Apart from being advertised as \"Fun for the whole family\", the parody is also mentioned at other times during that same episode, such as in a satirical advertisement in which orphans are offered a free \"\"Oedipus Rex\" ashes urn\" as a promotional offer after losing a relative.\n\n\n\n"}

Clock time and calendar time have duodecimal or sexagesimal orders of magnitude rather than decimal, i.e. a year is 12 months, and a minute is 60 seconds.\n\nThe smallest meaningful increment of time is the Planck time, the time light takes to traverse the Planck distance, many decimal orders of magnitude smaller than a second. The largest \"realized\" amount of time, given known scientific data, is the age of the universe, about 13.8 billion years - the time since the Big Bang as measured in the cosmic microwave background rest frame. Those amounts of time together span 60 decimal orders of magnitude. Metric prefixes are defined spanning 10 to 10, 48 decimal orders of magnitude which may be used in conjunction with the metric base unit of second. Metric units of time larger than the second are most commonly seen only in a few scientific contexts such as observational astronomy and materials science although this depends on author; for everyday usage and most other scientific contexts the common units of minutes (60 s), hours (3600 s or 3.6 ks), days (86 400 s), weeks, months, and years (of which there are a number of variations) are commonly used. Weeks, months and years are significantly variable units whose length crucially depends on the choice of calendar and is often not regular even with a calendar, e.g. leap years versus regular years in the Gregorian calendar. This makes them problematic for use against a linear and regular time scale such as that defined by the SI since it is not clear as to which version of these units we are to be using. Because of this, in the table below we will not use weeks and months and the year we will use is the Julian year of astronomy, or 365.25 days of 86 400 s exactly, also called an annum and denoted with the symbol \"a\", whose definition is based on the average length of a year of the Julian calendar which had one leap year every and always every 4 years against common years of 365 days each. This unit is used, following the convention of geological science, to form larger units of time by the application of SI prefixes to it at least up to \"giga-annum\", or Ga, equal to 1 000 000 000 a (short scale: one \"billion\" years, long scale: one \"milliard\" years).\n\nIn this table, large intervals of time surpassing one second are catalogued in order of the SI multiples of the second as well as their equivalent in common time units of minutes, hours, days, and Julian years.\n\n"}

The season was produced primarily using footage, costumes, and props from Japanese Super Sentai series \"Shuriken Sentai Ninninger\" with minimal costume and prop elements being recycled from \"Ressha Sentai ToQger\". The show is produced by Saban Brands and premiered on Nickelodeon on January 21, 2017.\n\nThe second season of \"Ninja Steel\", and twenty-fifth \"Power Rangers\" season overall, known as Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel premiered on January 27, 2018. As the twenty-fifth anniversary of the \"Power Rangers\" franchise, \"Super Ninja Steel\" will feature popular Rangers from past seasons. It is also the last \"Power Rangers\" series to have toys manufactured and distributed by Bandai as well as the last season produced by Saban Brands following the purchase of the franchise by Hasbro over May and June 2018.\n\nGalvanax is the reigning champion of \"Galaxy Warriors,\" the most popular intergalactic TV game show in the universe where contestants from all over the universe battle to prove who is the galaxy's mightiest warrior. Galvanax is determined to become invincible by controlling the mythical Ninja Nexus Prism, which contains the supernatural Ninja Nexus Star. Master Dane Romero fought Galvanax to keep him from obtaining the Nexus Star and apparently sacrificed himself to thwart Galvanax's plan, while in the process separating the Nexus Star into six separate Ninja Power Stars and creating from the metal of the Prism, the legendary Ninja Steel, though Galvanax and his minions Madame Odius and Ripcon made off with his son Brody. Ten years later, an enslaved Brody escapes from Galvanax's ship with the Prism, the Power Stars, and fellow slaves Redbot and Mick Kanic and returns to Earth, descending into the city of Summer Cove where they meet high school students Preston Tien, Sarah Thompson, Calvin Maxwell and Hayley Foster who manage to retrieve the Power Stars from the Prism and morph into the Ninja Steel Power Rangers. Furious at the outcome, Galvanax sends his warrior contestants down to Earth to steal the Prism where each epic battle against the Rangers is broadcast throughout the universe. Together, the Rangers must master their arsenal of Power Stars, Mega Morph Cycles, and Zords, that are all made from the Ninja Steel, in order to stop this evil threat and save the Earth from destruction.\n\nDuring the final battle against Galvanax, the Ninja Nexus Prism restores Brody's broken Red Ninja Power Star where it not only turns Mick into an alternate Red Ranger, but also restores Master Dane Romero. The Rangers are able to destroy Galvanax with the Ninja Nexus Prism going inactive, but Madame Odius survives the unexpected Ninja Steel meteor attack on Galvanax's ship.\n\nIn \"Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel\", the heroic teens find themselves face-to-face with an old enemy when they discover that Madame Odius is still alive and is more determined than ever to steal the Ninja Nexus Prism and revive its powers for her nefarious purposes with the assistance of Badonna, Brax, and General Tynamon. Now it is up to the Rangers and some unexpected help from new friends to use the power of teamwork to protect the Prism, defeat Madame Odius, and save the world.\n\nSledge and his crew from \"Power Rangers Dino Charge\" escape from a wormhole (due to events from the \"Power Rangers Dino Super Charge\" finale - \"End of Extinction\"), thus arriving in the main dimension of the Power Rangers multiverse. After finding the wreckage of the Warrior Dome and the survivors of the asteroid collision (including Madame Odius and Cosmo Royale), Sledge offers to fix the ship in exchange for the asteroid, which is covered in Ninja Super Steel, a metal even stronger than Ninja Steel. Instead, Odius tricks him and gains the loyalty of a prisoner of his named Badonna, takes the Super Steel for herself, and gets the ship fixed regardless. Putting Galaxy Warriors back on the air, Odius, Badonna, and a new contestant named Smellephant attack Earth to revive the Ninja Nexus Prism and forge evil Ninja Stars from Super Steel. Thanks to prior warning from a returning Mick and using every trick up their sleeves, the former Rangers manage to claim the Super Steel and regain their powers, though much stronger than before.\n\nWith new and improved powers and gear, the Rangers protect the Ninja Power Stars from Odius and her Warrior contestants. In order to get an edge on them, Badonna books a ragtag team of Galactic Ninjas, intent on proving their superiority to the \"Earth Ninjas\". Odius hatches a plan to send the Galactic Ninjas into fatal battles in order to claim their Ninja Medallions for the creation of Foxatron, her own Zord. Foxatron destroys the Ninja Ultrazord, leaving the Rangers' Zord Stars burned and in no condition for use. Luckily, with the help of three mysterious cloaked figures, they are able to repair the Zord Stars and destroy Foxatron with their new Ninja Blaze Megazord, gained by proving to the Prism, that they're kind at heart enough to be worthy of such power.\n\nAs revenge, Odius forms an alliance with Lord Draven, ruler of an evil dimension known as the Antiverse. The two plan to unite all dimensions into one and use an army of Robo Ranger clones to conquer them all. Fortunately, the Ninja Steel Rangers and a team of Legendary Rangers (including the three cloaked figures revealed to be Wes Collins, Gemma from RPM, and Koda from Dino Charge, as well as Tommy Oliver, Katherine Hillard, Rocky DeSantos, Trent Fernandez-Mercer, T.J. Johnson, Antonio Garcia, and Gia Moran, all of whom escaped Draven's captivity) are able to destroy Draven and stop the merging of the dimensions.\n\nAfter the fall of the Galactic Ninjas and Draven's demise, Odius continues to plot the Rangers' downfall, even as going as far as to trick the legendary Space Sheriff Skyfire into viewing the Rangers as thieves, while the sheriff was hunting a wanted criminal and demolitions expert named Blammo, who was a contestant on Galaxy Warriors at the time. Odius makes yet another deal, this time with General Tynamon, manager of a famous fighter named Brax. Tynamon is actually a small monster using a robot suit to look big, hoping Odius will grant him to grow big if he can get the Power Stars and destroy the Rangers. While he does succeed in testing out her mind control device and thus gaining Mick as an ally, the monster is only able to achieve his dream for a small amount of time, as he is destroyed by the Rangers. For Odius however, losing Tynamon is meaningless as Mick can help her launch her ultimate plan.\n\nMick promises to help her broadcast a signal which will mind control the whole planet. A monster named Gorrox disguises as a TV producer to get humans for her broadcast. The audition he holds causes Calvin and Hayley to argue and breakup, while, Victor and Monty are chosen for the role. Gorrox reveals himself and is destroyed along with a vengeful Brax, in battle with the Rangers. Unfortunately, they are too late as Odius now controls half the human race and has ambushed Summer Cove High. While Sarah and Hayley sneak onto the Warrior Dome to save a mind controlled Calvin, the Romero brothers and Preston watch as Odius turns the Nexus Prism evil and forges a Ninja Nexus Super Star, revealing she's wanted to control an army with the Prism's power for a thousand years. The three are then forced to fight Brody's father, whom was also mind controlled. Luckily, Hayley destroys the satellite and gets back together with a free Calvin. Odius' former human soldiers escape with Victor and Monty's help, leading to the destruction of the Warrior Dome and demise of Cosmo Royale and Badonna. Despite this, Odious is still able to unite with the Nexus Super Star. The Rangers reunite and in order to combat a seemingly unstoppable Odious, infuse themselves with the power of the Nexus Star with a little help from Preston's magic. Try as she may, Odius is no match for a whole team of those with equal powers to hers, falling in the final battle when the Rangers combine their Nexus Stars combined with the Nexus Power and bringing peace to Earth. Victor and Monty are rewarded for their bravery in helping to stop Odius while the Rangers return their powers to the Ninja Nexus Prism, which uses its power to reforge its Ninja Steel crust and flies off in search of another planet in need. With Mick remaining on Earth as their teacher (though remaining in contact with his family through satellite), the Rangers return to life as normal high school students. Sledge and his crew return again on Christmas Sledge, Poisandra, Wrench as well as Poisandra's audience, probably his ship and Vivix are destroyed this time for good.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Prodetur directs tourist activities in Morazán which ensure the continuity of the Rio Sapo preservation initiative.\n\nThe department of Morazán was the site of some of the fiercest fighting during the Salvadoran civil war of 1980-1992. It was also the scene of the conflict's most notorious massacre, in the village of El Mozote. Perquín was long a rebel stronghold, and sometimes designated the FMLN's unofficial capital. The war had an ambivalent effect on the region's natural ecosystem: on the one hand, the combat was a source of widespread destruction; on the other hand, it prevented significant urbanization.\n\nProdetur oversees the conservation and management of 6,000 hectares along the Rio Sapo in Morazán Department, located in the northeast of El Salvador. The Rio Sapo area is particularly significant due to the ecosystem surrounding it, which includes several pine forests, 84 species of threatened flora and fauna, and 24 species of endangered fauna. Part of Prodetur’s purpose is to ensure the protection of these rare species by constant monitoring.\n\nThe protection of the Rio Sapo area was initiated in 2000 but also included the installment of tourist services, such as those offered by Prodetur. Since then Prodetur has attracted tourist attention while at the same time stressing a community-wide conservation and management of the natural resources. The protection of the Rio Sapo area is ensured through development of environmental-friendly infrastructure, environmental education, research of the Rio Sapo ecosystem, and the use of clean technologies.\n\nThe funds to implement Prodetur programs are provided by the Fund Initiative of the Americas, Program of Small Donations, the World Fund for the Environment, and the Binational Program of Frontier Development. Under the Binational Program of Frontier Development which was implemented in 2005, both Honduras and El Salvador created nuclei of development along the border provinces. Nucleus of Local Development number three, located in Morazán, has largely been a tourism initiative, of which Prodetur is a part. Prodetur, in coordination with bordering municipalities in Honduras, has developed a series of programs that integrate the southern part of Honduras and the department of Morazán. Central to this tourism initiative is a series of services offered by Prodetur and Morazán province, such as food, lodging, transportation, and various outdoor/recreation activities, including, but not limited to, mountain biking, bird-watching, nature walks, hiking, camping, and swimming.\n\nProdetur operates in villages and hamlets along one of the most historically significant roads in Morazán. The Ruta de la Paz Lenca was a road of strategic importance, militarily and economically, during the Salvadoran Civil War which lasted from 1980 to 1992. Subsequently, the north of Morazán has become an important tourist destination for its historic sites from the civil war. Prodetur has utilized this increasing tourist attention to Morazán by directing these tourists to local businesses for their accommodations. In this way, the local post-war economy benefits from the tourist activity as well. Prodetur’s operation benefits the communities along the Ruta de Paz, including Perquín, Arambala, Joacaitique, San Fernando, Joateca, Meanguera, El Rosario, Torola, Guatajiagua, Cacaopera and Maroon. Prodetur and the local businesses of these towns, together, offer tourists guided tours of natural and historic attractions, lodging, meals, recreational activities, and transportation to/from sites.\n"}

It covers the revolution of music access and consumption resulted by the digital age and the effects it has on the music industry. The book also details the ways that artists have altered their business model in response to these changes to take advantage of digital distribution and peer-to-peer file sharing. Kot uses his firsthand access to illustrate how major recording artists have responded to the declining relevance of the big record companies. The Metallica and Napster case back in 2000 is brought up defining Metallica's clear stance on file-sharing. On the other hand, already highly successful musicians such as Trent Reznor and Prince believed in giving away their albums. The book mentions Radiohead's prior hesitation of becoming an independent band due to having to deal with all the business aspects of the industry such as setting up their own business meetings. However, the band was not satisfied with the fact that their major label could not keep up with how fans were downloading their music off the Internet. Eventually Radiohead put up their album \"In Rainbows\" (2007) on their website through a pay what you want model where fans can decide how much the album is worth. Kot explains that a reason why young people started the file-sharing trend was because of the inability to connect with pop music that the record companies advertised then. Teenagers went to the Internet to find music that they can better relate to. This played a role in building the audience of indie bands like Death Cab for Cutie, Bright Eyes, Clap Your Hands, Girl Talk, and Arcade Fire with little or no major label input. The music industry is filing lawsuits when it has a history of illegal actions such as Payola and taking advantage of artists; therefore, it is a contender for phony \"moral posturing\", according to Kot. Not making a deal with Napster instead to create a legal music downloading service in 2001 just further damaged the industry because other free music sharing websites were created. Kot thinks that keeping up with the way music is consumed in the digital age has not only benefited fans, but also musicians: “In this world, the fringe players could more easily find and build a dedicated audience, and a musical ecosystem encompassing thousands of microcultures began to emerge.”\n\nIt was published on May 19, 2009 by the Scribner imprint of Simon & Schuster.\n\nThe book has received mostly favorable reviews. The Boston Globe claims it is “well-researched and highly opinionated,” and that it “captures the exciting immediacy of Internet-spawned music,\" however pointing out Kot’s siding with illegal downloading does not capture the negative effects it has on other artists. The Christian Science Monitor praises Kot’s journalism saying that it’s “even-tempered and provocative, factual, and soulful,” even if the book does not conclude with a solution to the harm caused by file-sharing. The New York Times critic, Michiko Kakutani, bemoans the narrow viewpoint of Kot, who champions the position of young music fans who are reluctant to pay for all the music they listen to.\n\n"}

They form a web-like network that blankets the Altiplano.\n\nRecent research revealed that this network of lines covers an area of 22,525 square kilometers, approximately fifteen times larger than the area covered by the Nazca Lines in Peru. Rough estimates put their linear length at approximately 16,000 kilometers, roughly three times the breadth of the United States. As such, the Sajama Lines are the largest archaeological site in the Andes and might be considered the largest artwork in the world.\n\nThe lines were created by scraping aside vegetation and the dark surface material consisting of soil and oxidized rock and exposing the lighter subsurface material. Like the better-known Nazca Lines (which differ from the Sajama Lines in that some of the Nazca are depictions of animals) neither the purpose of these lines, nor how the makers achieved such precision, are completely understood.\n\nScholars at the University of Pennsylvania describe:\nWhile many of these sacred lines extend as far as ten or twenty kilometers (and perhaps further), they all seem to maintain a remarkable straightness despite rugged topography and natural obstacles. The sheer number and length of these lines is often difficult to perceive from ground level, but from the air or hilltop vantage points, they are stunning.\nMany believe that the lines were originally used by indigenous people when they made sacred pilgrimages. Interspersed among this network of radial lines and aligned to where lines meet are \"wak'as\" (shrines), \"chullpas\" (burial towers) and hamlets, making the area a unique cultural landscape. Though the region is now sparsely populated there is evidence that some of the lines are still in use as footpaths.\n\nThe earliest account of the Sajama Lines in English is a brief reference by traveler Aimé Felix Tschiffely in 1932. That same decade, anthropologist Alfred Metraux brought the lines and associated structures to the attention of scholars when he published ethnographic fieldwork about the Aymara and Chipaya people of the Carangas region.\n\nIn the 1970s, British writer and filmmaker Tony Morrison reported on this network of sacred lines and roadways. In recent years, organizations such as the Landmarks Foundation have studied and mapped the Sajama Lines to create a database to help protect the landscape from threats of erosion, unchecked internationally financed development and tourism in the area, and other dangers that come from the absence of a management plan.\n\nThe Landmarks Foundation worked with the University of Pennsylvania to develop the \"Tierra Sajama project\" which used geographic information systems (GIS) and other analytic digital media tools to map, describe, and analyze the Sajama Lines and their associated structures in order to offer strategies to protect and promote the Lines in the future. The Tierra Sajama project:\n\n\nAccording to Tierra Sajama participants:\nThe Sajama Lines are extraordinary examples of human achievement and spiritual expression. With proper preservation and management, responsible development, erosion prevention and measures to minimize vandalism the Sajama Lines can be protected to the benefit of tourists from all over the world as well as the local people.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2997434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2997434", "title": "Siren (video game)", "text": "Siren (video game)\n\n, known as Forbidden Siren in the PAL region, is a survival horror stealth game developed by SCE Japan Studio and Project Siren, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2 in . The game's plot revolves around an interconnected cast of characters that possess a power which enables them to see and hear what a nearby character sees. It was followed by two sequel/remakes and a loose film adaption. On June 14, 2016 it was re-released for the PlayStation 4 which is part of the PS2 on PS4 library with added trophy support and at a higher resolution.\n\n\"Siren\" is divided into stages, each taking place in one of ten areas in the village of Hanuda, and organized chronologically in a table called the \"Link Navigator\". In order to complete a stage, the player must accomplish a primary objective that usually involves reaching an exit point, subduing undead enemies called \"shibito\", or finding an item. Objectives in different stages are interconnected via a butterfly effect, and a character's actions in one stage can trigger a secondary objective in another stage.\n\nThere are miscellaneous items scattered throughout each stage that give the player further insight into the plot's background. Once obtained, these items are archived in a catalog and can be viewed at any time during the game's duration. The game's player characters possess a psychic power known as \"sightjacking\", which enables them to see and hear what a nearby Shibito or human sees and hears, and thus pinpoint its position, as well as gain knowledge of their activities and of the position of obtainable items. The clarity of each target depends on the distance from the player character. Once a point of view is located, it can be assigned to one of certain buttons of the controller to easily switch between multiple points of view. However, the player character is unable to move during use of the ability and is thus vulnerable to attack.\n\nThe game encourages the player to avoid Shibito rather than fight them. Characters can walk silently, avoid the use of a flashlight, and crouch behind objects to elude detection. Certain mission objectives require the player character to use items and/or the environment to distract Shibito from their activity, in order for them to achieve a goal. Others require the player to escort a non-player character. Player characters can also shout at any time in order to get the attention of nearby Shibito. Within most stages, the player character can hide in certain places such as cupboards and lock doors to prevent Shibito from entering. When a Shibito hears a sound made by the player character, it will search in the direction from which they heard the sound. If a character is seen by a Shibito, the latter will pursue the character to kill them either with a melee or ranged weapon or by strangulation. The Shibito will also shout to alert other nearby Shibito. Once the character has remained out of the Shibito's sight for a period of time, the Shibito will give up and resume its usual habits. Weapons are available for the player throughout the game, ranging from melee weapons to firearms. While Shibito can be knocked out in combat, they cannot be killed and will reanimate after a short period of time. If a character is injured, they will eventually recover after a short period of time. Characters will also lose stamina during combat and while running, which will also naturally refill after a short amount of time.\n\n\"Siren\" is set in a Japanese village named Hanuda (Hanyūda in the Japanese version). With strong religious beliefs important in the area, the locals like to keep to themselves and have sought to keep Hanuda isolated from the outside world. Following the interruption of a ritual near Hanuda, and a subsequent earthquake, the village teeters between time and space, with an infinite sea of red water replacing the mountainous territory. The crux of the story focuses on the efforts of Hisako Yao, the leader of the local religion, to resurrect or re-awaken a god through a ceremony. The 'Siren' of the title is the god's call, summoning Hanuda's residents to immerse themselves in the red water, thus creating an army of subordinates called . The shibito then go about building a nest to house the god's corporeal form once it is summoned, as well as killing and converting any remaining humans left in Hanuda. The story is told through the perspectives of ten survivors, some of whom are natives of Hanuda, and is presented out of chronological order over the three days in which the plot takes place.\n\nRather than employ traditional facial animation methods with polygonal transformation, images of real human faces were captured from eight different angles and superimposed onto the character models, an effect similar to projecting film onto the blank face of a mannequin.\n\nThe game was re-released for the PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Store. On 14 June 2016 the game received a digital release for the PlayStation 4 in NA and PAL regions as an emulated and upscaled version of the PlayStation 2 original with added Trophy support.\n\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggegation website Metacritic. GameSpot's reviewer Bethany Massimilla concluded that although the game had a great story, and interesting characters, it was also tedious. IGN's reviewer Jeremy Dunham praised the originality of the concept, the use of Sightjacking, the graphics and the storyline, but criticized the difficulty level and the trial and error nature of the gameplay. GameSpy's Bryan Stratton followed other reviewers in praising the storyline and atmosphere, but criticizing the nature of the gameplay. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of one nine, one seven, and two eights for a total of 32 out of 40.\n\n"}

Patañjali's \"sphoṭa\" is the invariant quality of speech. The acoustic element (\"dhvani\") can be long or short, loud or soft, but the \"sphoṭa\" remains unaffected by individual speaker differences. Thus, a single phoneme (\"varṇa\") such as /k/, /p/ or /a/ is an abstraction, distinct from variants produced in actual enunciation. \nEternal qualities in language are already postulated by Yāska, in his \"Nirukta\" (1.1), where reference is made to another ancient grammarian, \"\", about whose work nothing is known, but who has been suggested as the original source of the concept. \nThe grammarian Vyāḍi, author of the lost text \"Saṃgraha\", may have developed some ideas in \"sphoṭa\" theory; in particular some distinctions relevant to \"dhvani\" are referred to by Bhartṛhari.\n\nThere is no use of ' as a technical term prior to Patañjali, but Pāṇini (6.1.123) refers to a grammarian named ' as one of his predecessors. This has induced Pāṇini's medieval commentators (such as Haradatta) to ascribe the first development of the ' to '.\n\nThe account of the Chinese traveller Yi-Jing places a firm \"terminus ante quem\" of AD 670 on Bhartrhari. Scholarly opinion had formerly tended to place him in the 6th or 7th century; current consensus places him in the 5th century. By some traditional accounts, he is the same as the poet Bhartṛhari who wrote the Śatakatraya.\n\nIn the , the term \"sphoṭa\" takes on a finer nuance, but there is some dissension among scholars as to what Bhartṛhari intended to say. \"Sphoṭa\" retains its invariant attribute, but sometimes its indivisibility is emphasized and at other times it is said to operate at several levels.\nIn verse I.93, Bhartṛhari states that the \"sphota\" is the universal or linguistic type — sentence-type or word-type, as opposed to their tokens (sounds).\n\nBhartṛhari develops this doctrine in a metaphysical setting, where he views \"sphoṭa\" as the language capability of man, revealing his consciousness. \nIndeed, the ultimate reality is also expressible in language, the \"śabda-brahman\", or \"Eternal Verbum\".\nEarly Indologists such as A. B. Keith felt that Bhartṛhari's \"sphoṭa\" was a mystical notion, owing to the metaphysical underpinning of Bhartṛhari's text, \"Vākyapādiya\" where it is discussed. Also, the notion of \"flash or insight\" or \"revelation\" central to the concept also lent itself to this viewpoint. However, the modern view is that it is perhaps a more psychological distinction.\n\nBhartṛhari expands on the notion of \"sphoṭa\" in Patañjali, and discusses three levels:\n\nHe makes a distinction between \"sphoṭa\", which is whole and indivisible, and \"nāda\", the sound, which is sequenced and therefore divisible. The \"sphoṭa\" is the causal root, the intention, behind an utterance, in which sense is similar to the notion of lemma in most psycholinguistic theories of speech production. However, \"sphoṭa\" arises also in the listener, which is different from the lemma position. Uttering the \"nāda\" induces the same mental state or \"sphoṭa\" in the listener - it comes as a whole, in a flash of recognition or intuition (\"pratibhā\", 'shining forth'). This is particularly true for \"vakya-sphoṭa\", where the entire sentence is thought of (by the speaker), and grasped (by the listener) as a whole.\n\nBimal K. Matilal (1990) has tried to unify these views - he feels that for Bhartṛhari the very process of thinking involves vibrations, so that thought has some sound-like properties. Thought operates by \"śabdana\"or 'speaking', - so that the mechanisms of thought are the same as that of language. Indeed, Bhartṛhari seems to be saying that thought is not possible without language. This leads to a somewhat whorfian position on the relationship between language and thought. The \"sphoṭa\" then is the carrier of this thought, as a primordial vibration.\n\nSometimes the \"nāda-sphoṭa\" distinction is posited in terms of the signifier-signified mapping, but this is a misconception. In traditional Sanskrit linguistic discourse (e.g. in Katyāyana), \"vācaka\" refers to the signifier, and 'vācya' the signified. The 'vācaka-vācya' relation is eternal for Katyāyana and the Mīmāṃsakas, but is conventional among the Nyāya. However, in Bhartṛhari, this duality is given up in favour of a more holistic view - for him, there is no independent meaning or signified; the meaning is inherent in the word or the sphoṭa itself.\n\n\"Sphoṭa\" theory remained widely influential in Indian philosophy of language and was the focus of much debate over several centuries. It was adopted by most scholars of Vyākaraṇa (grammar), but both the Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya schools rejected it, primarily on the grounds of compositionality. Adherents of the 'sphota' doctrine were holistic or non-compositional (\"a-khanḍa-pakṣa\"), suggesting that many larger units of language are understood as a whole, whereas the Mīmāṃsakas in particular proposed compositionality (\"khanḍa-pakṣa\"). According to the former, word meanings, if any, are arrived at after analyzing the sentences in which they occur. This debate had many of the features animating present day debates in language over semantic holism, for example.\n\nThe \"Mīmāṃsakas\" felt that the sound-units or the letters alone make up the word. The sound-units are uttered in sequence, but each leaves behind an impression, and the meaning is grasped only when the last unit is uttered. The position was most ably stated by Kumarila Bhatta (7th century) who argued that the 'sphoṭas' at the word and sentence level are after all composed of the smaller units, and cannot be different from their combination. However, in the end it is cognized as a whole, and this leads to the misperception of the \"sphoṭa\" as a single indivisible unit. Each sound unit in the utterance is an eternal, and the actual sounds differ owing to differences in manifestation.\n\nThe \"Nyāya\" view is enunciated among others by Jayanta (9th century), who argues against the \"Mīmāṃsā\" position by saying that the sound units as uttered are different; e.g. for the sound [g], we infer its 'g-hood' based on its similarity to other such sounds, and not because of any underlying eternal. Also, the \"vācaka-vācya\" linkage is viewed as arbitrary and conventional, and not eternal. However, he agrees with Kumarila in terms of the compositionality of an utterance.\n\nThroughout the second millennium, a number of treatises discussed the \"sphoṭa\" doctrine. Particularly notable is Nageśabhaṭṭa's \"Sphotavāda\" (18th century). Nageśa clearly defines \"sphoṭa\" as a carrier of meaning, and identifies eight levels, some of which are divisible.\n\nIn modern times, scholars of Bhartṛhari have included Ferdinand de Saussure, who did his doctoral work on the genitive in Sanskrit, and lectured on Sanskrit and Indo-European languages at the Paris and at the University of Geneva for nearly three decades. It is thought that he might have been influenced by some ideas of Bhartṛhari, particularly the \"sphoṭa\" debate. In particular, his description of the sign, as composed of the signifier and the signified, where these entities are not separable - the whole mapping from sound to denotation constitutes the sign, seems to have some colourings of \"sphoṭa\" in it. Many other prominent European scholars around 1900, including linguists such as Leonard Bloomfield and Roman Jakobson may have been influenced by Bhartṛhari.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is a professor of biology at Brigham Young University (BYU) He grew up in Moab, Utah and lives in Pleasant Grove, Utah.\n\nAfter failing high school history, Peck studied to receive his GED. Peck received a bachelor's degree in 1986 from Brigham Young University in statistics and computer science with a minor in zoology. His master's is from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (environmental biostatistics), and his 1997 PhD from North Carolina State University (biomathematics and entomology). His dissertation was titled \"Spatial Patterns and Processes in the Evolution of Insecticide Resistance.\"\n\nDuring their honeymoon, Steven and his wife, Lori, were hit by a drunk driver in Oregon. They were badly injured, but survived. Steven and Lori have five children.\n\nPeck believes that God \"only enters the universe through our consciousness.\" He compares scriptural interpretation to scientific interpretation, in that both nature and scriptures are unchanging, but our understanding of them changes over the course of generations. While the LDS church currently has no official position on evolution, Peck teaches evolution in the courses he teaches at BYU.\n\nOn the subject of writing, Peck says that it is a way for him to explore the complexities in his life. He stated that anything we do to build our knowledge of the universe helps to build the kingdom of God.\n\nIn 2008, Peck worked with the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria making models of tsetse fly ecology and population genetics.\n\nMichael Austin at \"Dialogue\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s website wrote that Peck is \"one of Mormonism's best living writers.\" Summarizing Peck's book \"Evolving Faith\", he wrote: \"Because all knowledge incorporates subjective assumptions, both religion and science require an element of faith.\" Literal interpretations of scripture cheat \"both religion, by ignoring what the author of the text was really trying to tell us, and science, by setting up unnecessary oppositions between important religious principles and easily testable facts.\" At the Association for Mormon Letters, Heather Young wrote that \"Evolving Faith\" had \"enlarged my appreciation for my time on earth and the part I can play in protecting its immeasurable gifts.\" At Common Consent, Steve Evans said the book was \"not for beginners\" and uses terminology that is difficult to understand, and that the two parts of the book were not well-connected. Of \"Wandering Realities\", Evans said the stories were \"wondrous and rich.\"\n\nIn \"A Short Stay in Hell\", a man must find the book of his life's story among every possible book. David Spaltro described the novella as \"one of the most original and powerfully moving things I’ve ever read\" and has acquired the rights to adapt it into a film. Doug Gibson at the \"Standard Examiner\" wrote that a hell that contains an \"eternity of the mundane\" was a \"pretty effective hell.\" Derek Lee at \"Rational Faiths\" wrote that the novella encouraged reflection on the nature of the afterlife and what living forever would mean.\n\nBHoges at \"By Common Consent\" praised \"Rifts of Rime\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s narrative and setting, and said that its discussion of religious topics, while plentiful, were a bit overt.\n\nPeck is a 2016 finalist for best short fiction, Association for Mormon Letters.\n\nLatter-day Saint speculative lay theology\n\n\nMany of these essays appear in the 2015 \"Evolving Faith: Wanderings of a Mormon Biologist\" .\n\n\nSome of these stories are collected in the 2015 \"Wandering Realities: Mormonish Short Fiction\" .\n\nMany of these poems appear in the collection \"Incorrect Astronomy\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The books in the genre also occasionally feature a murderer protagonist and are sometimes presented in a first person point of view. Tart Noir was labeled and effectively created as a genre by four writers during the 1990s, Sparkle Hayter, Lauren Henderson, Katy Munger, and Stella Duffy. Some of these writers have since collaborated on book signings and other events in order to promote the genre, along with creating a website called Tartcity.com.\n\nThe storylines and characters described in a Tart Noir novel includes the necessity of a heroine who is \"tough enough to take on criminals and cops\" and yet still have the personality of being able to be \"tender enough to love a man with rough edges\". The requirements were described by Stella Duffy as the novel needing to be \"maybe comedic, maybe violent, maybe sexual, definitely new-woman, neo-feminist, strong, smart and sharp.\"\n\nThe four writers first met at one of the many writers conferences that they attended. It was during one of these times in 1999 that they \"realized they were writing the same sort of thing\" and discussed doing events together under the banner Slut Noir. Sparkle Hayter changed the named to Tart Noir and decided to create a website in lieu of doing events. When asked why they had decided on the name of Tart Noir for the genre, Hayter explained that slut was a \"powerless word\" and that \"'tart' sounded like a lot more fun\". After bringing other women into the webzine, including Jennifer Blue, Tony Fennelly, Max Adams and J.J. Buch, Hayter edited the launch issue, then moved on to other projects. Munger took over editing, maintenance and expansion of the website. \n\nSince its beginnings, the genre has grown to include more than twenty other writers who have self-styled themselves as writers of Tart Noir. This is shown by the fact that exactly twenty Tart Noir writers have come together to write an anthology of original stories in the genre, itself titled \"Tart Noir\". The anthology was commissioned in 2002 by Stella Duffy and Lauren Henderson. One of those writers, Vicki Hendricks, describes herself as the first Tart Noir writer in the United States.\n\nTart Noir was featured prominently in 2001 by Lauren Henderson at the \"SheKilda\" convention, which was the \"first-ever women's crime convention\".\n"}
