It is an easy bike ride, walk or bus ride from Fremont Street. The name, \"18b,\" represents the original Arts District area, which consisted of 18 blocks. Today, the Arts District area has grown beyond those original 18 blocks and is a classic urban mix of residential, commercial and cultural uses that will continue to grow as the hub of the arts scene in Las Vegas.\n\nThe \"First Friday\" Art Walk is a monthly arts and cultural event drawing up to 30,000 visitors into the neighborhood on the first Friday evening of each month. This event encourages people to flock downtown to browse, buy, eat, drink and mingle. The event is a festival environment with food and beverage vendors, music, visual performances and artists/artisans/craftspeople displaying their works.\n\nThe district hosts a \"First Friday\" art walk on the first Friday of every month. First Friday offers an eclectic group of artists as well as \"entertainers of all types, including local bands, fire breathers, acrobats, break dancers, fortune tellers and performance artists.\"\n\nIn addition to \"First Friday\", Preview Thursday is held preceding night before the block party. It is a subdued night of gallery openings and special events around the arts district without the large crowds that the main event can bring.\n\nThe district is loosely bounded by Hoover Avenue, Wyoming Avenue, Las Vegas Boulevard, and Commerce Street. The official bounds are visible on the \"City of Las Vegas\" website.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56634955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56634955", "title": "Albina Girfanova", "text": "Albina Girfanova\n\nAlbina Hakimovna Girfanova (Russian: Гирфанова, Альбина Хакимовна) (1 February 1957 – 2 February 2018), was a Russian linguist and anthropologist. She worked at Institute for Linguistic Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences, and later at Saint Petersburg State University, where she attained the rank of Docent (Associate professor). Girfanofa is most known for her work on Udege and Oroch languages, as well as on a number of other Tungusic languages and Balkan languages. She is the author of the most significant vocabulary of Udege, published in Russia, as well as other important studies and reference sources of Udege, Oroch and Balkan languages.\n\nGirfanova was born in Weimar, which was then a city in East Germany (DDR), where her family was, probably, stationed at this time, working with the Soviet military. Later family moved to Saint Petersburg, and Girfanova started her undergraduate studies at the Department of General Linguistics (Faculty of Philology) at the Saint Petersburg State University. She majored in Albanian philology at the chair of Albanian language and literature, established at 1957 by initiative of Prof. Agnia Vasilevna Desnickaja. Albina Girfanova formed as a philologist and albanologist under the guidance of professors A. V. Desnickaja, G. I. Entrej, I. I. Voronina, etc. She graduated from the Saint Petersburg State University, majoring in Albanian language, in 1981. However, she did not continue studies in Albanian language, but joined Department of Altaic languages at the Leningrad Branch of the , Russian Academy of Sciences, in Saint Petersburg (at that time, Leningrad), and devoted herself to study of Tungusic languages and cultures of Tungusic peoples.\n\nImmediately upon graduation from Saint Petersburg State University Girfanova obtains a fellow position as a junior researcher (стажер-исследователь) at the department of Altaic languages at the Institute for Linguistics Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences (in years 1952 - 1991: the Leningrad branch of Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR). She was majoring in Albanian language at college, but now switches to study of Tungusic languages, primarily Udege and Oroch. At the same time, she continues studying Turkish and Albanian languages, modern Greek language - in time being, she becomes a veritable polyglot.\n\nAfter three years as a junior researcher, Girfanova secures a post-graduate position in her department. In the Soviet Academy's context at that time, successful graduation from this position practically guaranteed a life-time tenure with the institution; therefore, obtaining such position in the humanities at that time was considered a career success. Girfanova publishes several articles on Udege language. Upon graduation from her post-graduate studies, she is promoted to research fellow position at the same department.\n\nIt took another two years for Girfanova to write and defend her Candidate of Science Dissertation (equivalent of PhD. thesis), entitled \"Indicative Verb Forms in Udege Language\", in 1988.\nThe pinnacle of her studies of Udege language becomes the most significant \"Vocabulary of Udege Language\", published in Russia.\n\nGirfanova have invested considerable time into lexicography of Udege and Oroch languages. She will be mostly known as the author of the best \"Vocabulary of Udege Language\". It is not the first and only vocabulary of Udege language, but, according to the review by A.A.Byrykin, it is the most linguistically solid vocabulary of Udege.\nHer lexicographic and etymological studies were not limited to Tungusic languages. She studied cross-linguistic connections of Balkan toponyms, etc. She was working on a project of a dictionary of Turkic terminology in the languages of Southeast Europe.\n\nAlongside time-consuming lexicographic work, Girfanova continued grammatical and syntactic studies of Tungusic languages, and devoted some time to the history of studying of these languages.\n\nGirfanova's interest to Tungusic peoples was not limited by language studies. She conducted folkloristic and entnographic studies (marriage rites, kinship terminology), including study of shamanism. Girfanova was a member of International Society for Shamanistic Research.\n\nWhile in the Soviet Union position of a researcher at an institute of the Academy of Sciences used to be a life-time tenure position, there was no job security in the new Russia, and financing of the Academy decreased dramatically. In 2003, changes happened at Institute for Linguistic Studies, the Altaic departmen effectively stopped to exist, and Girfanova was let go. That was, in her own words in 2005, a painful crisis of her academic career: \"two years ago the author, the only specialist in Udege language in the country was fired from the Altaic department of ILI of RAS living out the rest of its days, abandoned by researchers and later abolished, in spite of the position of a scientific researcher successfully acquired three months before the department’s abolishment (I am the author of the only thesis of C. Sc. devoted to Udege language, written and defended in this country, 70 publications, including 5 monographs on the mentioned above Udege language)\".\nFortunately, she was immediately hired by her alma mater, Saint Petersburg State University, as an associate professor (docent). Unfortunately, she had to revert to teaching Albanian and Turkish languages, which considerably diminished time for academic research and publications.\n\n\nGirfanova did not only teach Tungisic and Balkan languages, she is also an author of popular books, presenting Udege and Albanian cultures to the world, so she was honoured by an obituary from Albanian Embassy in Russia - it is not something that done for a regular language professor. Beside being an academic scholar, she gave full assistance to the educational system in Russia, to educate students in Tungusic languages, publishing a few textbooks for elementary school. She was really concerned about well-being of endangered Tungusic languages, and was socially active to help them to survive. As Oliver Corff mentioned in his obituary for Girfanova, \"Her critical understanding of the intentions and outcomes of Russia’s minority policies allowed her to come forward with substantial suggestions for improvements acknowledged by politicians. In autumn 2017 she was invited by the Department of Interior Politics of Primorsky Krai as moderator for a course on the revival of the Udege language in the framework of a larger nationality policy programme from 2018 to 2020. Pavel Yasevich, Director of the Department, lauds her as the foremost authority on Udege and Oroch languages in Russia.\"\n\nGirfanova passed away on February 2, 2018, the day after her 61st birthday.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31113163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31113163", "title": "Angry Birds", "text": "Angry Birds\n\nAngry Birds is a video game franchise created by Finnish company Rovio Entertainment. The series focuses on multi-colored birds who try to save their eggs from green-colored pigs, their enemies. Inspired by \"Crush the Castle\", the game has been praised for its successful combination of fun gameplay, comical style, and low price. Its popularity led to many spin-offs, versions of \"Angry Birds\" being created for PCs and video game consoles, a market for merchandise featuring its characters, a televised cartoon series, and a feature film. In January 2014 there had been over two billion downloads across all platforms, including both regular and special editions: as of July 2015, the series' games have been downloaded more than three billion times collectively, making it the most downloaded freemium game series of all time. The original \"Angry Birds\" has been called \"one of the most mainstream games out right now\", \"one of the great runaway hits of 2010\", and \"the largest mobile app success the world has seen so far\". An animated feature film based on the series was released by Columbia Pictures on 20 May 2016, and the first main-series sequel, \"Angry Birds 2\", was released on 30 July 2015.\n\nThe first game in the series was initially released in December 2009 for IOS. At the time, the swine flu epidemic was in the news, so the staff made the birds' enemies pigs. The company released ports of the game for other touchscreen smartphone operating systems, including Android, Symbian, and Windows Phone, and PCs.\n\nIn 2017, the company has valuated at $2.25 billion or more, the company named Zynga which is another Game developer rejected the buyout offer of $2.25 billion, which experts say the company is worth more than the offered price. \n\nThe following games were soft-launched in select countries in 2016 or 2017, but were never given a final, worldwide release.\n\nRovio is investigating ways to expand the \"Angry Birds\" brand, including merchandise, television shows and movies. Mikael Hed, CEO of Rovio Mobile, has envisioned a feature film in the stop-motion animation style of Aardman Animations. To that end, Rovio has purchased a Helsinki-based animation studio to prepare \"Angry Birds\" short cartoons on the Nicktoons station's Nickelodeon Extra, the first of which was a Christmas special named \"Wreck the Halls\" that debuted in December 2011. Hed acknowledges that such a film would be years away, and that Rovio must keep the characters relevant until then, by producing sequels or new ports of the original game.\n\n\"Angry Birds Toons\", a TV series based on the game, made its debut on March 16, 2013. \"Angry Birds Toons\" is released through third-party video distribution platforms, including Comcast's Xfinity On-Demand in the US, Samsung Smart TVs, and Roku set-top boxes. It is also available in a number of countries on traditional television broadcasts. \"Angry Birds Toons\" is available on mobile devices by an additional \"Angry Birds Toons\" channel on all of the \"Angry Birds\" apps homescreens. DVD version for the TV series was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. The series has a total of 3 seasons.\n\nOn April 11, 2014, Rovio released \"\"Piggy Tales\", a stop motion animated series.

Developed, produced and financed by Rovio Entertainment, it is animated by Sony Pictures Imageworks and distributed worldwide by Sony Pictures Entertainment under their Columbia Pictures banner. It is directed by animation veterans Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly in their directorial debut. Jon Vitti wrote the film's screenplay, and John Cohen and Catherine Winder served as the producers. Rovio also hired David Maisel, former executive producer of Marvel Studios films such as \"Iron Man\", to be the executive producer of its feature-length films. \n\nA sequel is scheduled to be released on August 16, 2019.\n\nThere have been several toys made from \"Angry Birds\" characters. The game's official website offers plush versions of the birds and pigs for sale, along with T-shirts featuring the game's logo and characters. In May 2011, Mattel released an \"Angry Birds\" board game, titled \"Angry Birds: Knock on Wood\". Over 10 million \"Angry Birds\" toys have been sold thus far. Rovio opened the first official \"Angry Birds\" retail store in Helsinki on 11 November 2011 at 11:11 a.m. local time. It expects to open its next retail store somewhere in China, considered the game's fastest-growing market. Merchandise has been successful, with 45% of Rovio's revenues in 2012 coming from branded merchandise.\n\nThe most notable toys are the Telepods, created by Hasbro. These figures are created for \"Angry Birds Star Wars II\", \"Angry Birds Go!\", Angry Birds \"Stella\", and Angry Birds \"Transformers\". Telepods use a similar digital toy hybrid concept as Skylanders or Disney Infinity characters, but there is a different technology behind it. These are figures used to \"teleport\" a character of the corresponding figure into the game by scanning a tiny QR code via the device's camera. The Telepod platform technology was invented by ReToy, a bMuse company, in partnership with Hasbro. Telepods figures are not only for this use, but can also be used with the toy set that comes with the toy, like other Angry Birds board games.\n\nOne of the 2012 New Models for Hot Wheels cars from Mattel is based on the Red, Blue, and Yellow Birds from \"Angry Birds\". The package card bears both the Hot Wheels and Angry Birds logo.\n\nIn 2016, Lego released six sets based on \"The Angry Birds Movie\".\n\nOn 2011, Rovio published a cookbook titled \"Bad Piggies: Egg Recipes\", along with doodle books based on some characters of the game.

National Geographic also has a book titled \"Angry Birds Feathered Fun\" for learning all about birds.\n\nIn the same year, Rovio created a contest with the prize \"Angry Birds: Hatching a Universe\", a book about the franchise and all the characters.\n\nAs of 10 March 2014, IDW Publishing announced that they will be publishing Angry Birds Comics starting in June 2014, with Paul Tobin being the writer.\n\nIn early 2012, Olvi started to manufacture Angry Birds soft drinks, after licensing with Rovio with two different tastes: \"Tropic\" (tropical fruits) and \"Paradise\" (pineapple-mandarin). In September 2012 Olvi released two new tastes to the soft drink collection: \"Lagoon\" (pear-apple) and \"Space Comet\" (orange-cola).\n\nThe game's characters have been used, officially or otherwise, in amusement park attractions. In September 2011, the Window of the World theme park in Changsha, China opened an unlicensed \"Angry Birds\" attraction. Visitors to the park uses a large slingshot to launch stuffed versions of the bird characters at green balloons that represent the pigs. Upon learning of the attraction, Rovio Entertainment reported to be considering working with the theme park to officially license it. In March 2012, Rovio announced plans for an official \"Angry Birds\" Land, that opened in 28 April 2012, at the Särkänniemi adventure park in Finland. Angry Birds Land opened in May 2014 at Johor Bahru City Centre in Malaysia.\n\nThe first Angry Birds themed park in the UK, was created in Sundown Adventureland, an attraction in the Nottinghamshire countryside.\n\nMost recently it was announced that UK theme park Thorpe Park would open their own Angry Birds Land themed area within the park in May 2014.

The first one was opened in Lightwater Valley that features dancefloors, and playgrounds that includes slides, and massive touchscreen devices for visitors to play Angry Birds. They also have Angry Birds Space attractions as part of the activity park, with a mini movie theater. They also include shops for Angry Birds merchandise and Birthday party rooms. The attraction also opened in Vuokatti. Vuokatti features obstacle courses and races, and a separate \"Angry Birds Town\" with cars for kids to ride.\n\nOn June 2013, Rovio and NASA opened an Angry Birds Space-themed park at the Kennedy Space Center titled \"Angry Birds Space Encounter\". It features various experiences to the Angry Birds Space video game, such as creating characters and shooting birds at pigs. The attraction was also opened in the Space Center Houston.\n\nIt was announced that the first Angry Birds World theme park will open at Doha Festival City. The first phase (which includes the indoor part) opened on June 3, 2018.\n\nThe \"Angry Birds\" characters have been referenced in television programs throughout the world. The Israeli comedy show \"Eretz Nehederet\" (in English: \"a Wonderful Country\"), one of the nation's most popular TV programs, satirized recent failed Israeli-Palestinian peace attempts by featuring the Angry Birds in peace negotiations with the pigs. Clips of the segment went viral, getting viewers from all around the world. The sketch received favorable coverage from a variety of independent blogs such as digitaltrends.com, hotair.com and intomobile.com, as well as from online news media agencies such as \"Haaretz\", \"The Christian Science Monitor\", \"The Guardian\", and MSNBC. American television hosts Conan O'Brien, Jon Stewart and Daniel Tosh have referenced the game in comedy sketches on their respective series, \"Conan\", \"The Daily Show\", and \"Tosh.0\". In the \"30 Rock\" episode \"Plan B\", guest star Aaron Sorkin laments to Liz Lemon, \"Our craft is dying while people are playing \"Angry Birds\" and poking each other on Facebook\". He then provides a tip for Liz to improve her score in the game. In February 2011, American journalist Jake Tapper mockingly introduced U.S. Senator Chris Coons as the \"Angry Birds champion of the Senate\" during the National Press Club's annual dinner. Some of the game's more notable fans include ex-Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom, who plays the iPad version of the game, and author Salman Rushdie, who claims he is \"something of a master at \"Angry Birds\"\". Basketball star Kevin Durant is an avid fan of \"Angry Birds\", and regularly plays other NBA stars in matches, although he is weary of cheating. In August 2011, the Milwaukee Brewers played the \"Angry Birds\" theme song during the pre-game introductions of the arch-rival St. Louis Cardinals players, in reference to former Cardinals' manager Tony LaRussa's propensity to bean opposing players. \"Angry Birds\" also appears briefly, for comic relief, during a scene in the 2013 film \"\", in which Zartan plays the game while waiting for the world leaders' response to his threats of annihilation. Angry Birds were featured in the 2013 Helsinki episode of Veep. Angry Birds was referenced in the film \"The Starving Games\", a parody of \"The Hunger Games\". A group in the Indian show Dance+ have done a dance based on Angry Birds.. Angry Birds was referenced in the Family Guy episode Turban Cowboy when after failed sky diving attempt by Peter results in him landing in a level.\n\n\"Angry Birds\" and its characters have been featured in advertisements for other products. In March 2011, the characters began appearing in a series of advertisements for Microsoft's Bing search engine. At the 2011 South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, Nokia used scrims on a downtown building to project an advertisement for its new N8 handset that included the game's characters. A June 2011 T-Mobile advertisement filmed in Barcelona, Spain included a real-life mock-up of the game in a city plaza, while Nokia used the game in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to promote an attempt to set a world record for the largest number of people playing a single mobile game. Finnair has also used Angry Birds in their advertising, including taping an Airbus A340 airliner with the Angry Birds figures and holding an Angry Birds tournament on board a flight to Singapore. Rovio has also prepared a number of web-based promotional variants of \"Angry Birds\" themed around creations of other companies, such as Finnish snack company Fazer, Spanish pizza delivery chain Telepizza, and Japanese television network Fuji TV, as well as promotions of American brands including Cheetos, Wonderful Pistachios and Coca-Cola. On November 2013, Indian brand Parle started a marketing campaign in which a trading card is included in each packet of Parle's Wafers and it included a related contest to win Angry Birds merchandise. In February 2016, Cadbury India had Angry Birds small figurines or tattoos in Cadbury Gems packs or Surprise balls. In June 2016, Kurkure India started an offer to win daily themed prizes and a trip to Angry Birds Activity Park in Malaysia.\n\nFinnish Formula One driver Heikki Kovalainen used an Angry Birds-themed helmet in the 2012 season, following a sponsorship deal with Rovio. Angry Birds also sponsored the Lotus F1 Team that year, with its logo on the top of each Lotus Renault F1 car's nosecone. As part of the deal, fellow Finn Kimi Räikkönen ran an Angry Birds 'Space' logo on his branded caps.\n\nHockey Bird, an angry hockey playing bird, was the official mascot of the 2012 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships. It was designed by Toni Kysenius and Rovio Entertainment.\n\nPremier League association football club Everton F.C. inked a deal with Rovio in 2017, whereby the Angry Birds logo appears on the club shirt's left sleeve beginning from the 2017–18 Premier League campaign.\n\nThe game's popularity has spawned knock-off and parody games that utilize the same basic mechanics as \"Angry Birds\". For example, \"Angry Turds\" features monkeys hurling feces and other objects at hunters who have stolen their babies. Another game, titled \"Chicks'n'Vixens\" and released in beta form on Windows Phone devices, replaces the birds and pigs with chickens and foxes, respectively. The developer of \"Chicks'n'Vixens\" intended the game as a challenge to Rovio Mobile, which stated at the time that a Windows Phone port of \"Angry Birds\" would not be ready until later in 2011. The \"Angry Birds\" theme song (\"Balkan Blast Remix\") and its characters appear in \"Just Dance 2016\".\n\n\"Angry Birds\" has inspired works of religious analogy. A five-part essay titled \"Angry Birds Yoga — How to Eliminate the Green Pigs in Your Life\" was written by Giridhari Dasa of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness of Brazil, utilizing the characters and gameplay mechanics to explain various concepts of yoga in Gaudiya Vaishnavism as understood and interpreted by the Hare Krishna. The piece attracted much media attention, in Brazil and abroad, for its unique method of philosophico-religious presentation. The piece was also recognized and appreciated by Rovio Mobile's Peter Vesterbacka, who was prompted to comment on Twitter, \"Very cool! I can see Angry Birds Yoga becoming a worldwide craze;-)\".\n\nRovio also launched the Angry Birds Playground in partnership with University of Helsinki. Based on the Finnish national curriculum the program covers maths, science, music, language, arts & crafts, physical education and social interaction. Focused on preschoolers of kindergarten age, the program introduced interactive learning material including books, posters, games and digital content. In 2015, a spin-off from the Rovio Angry Birds Playground was established as Fun Academy by co-founder and CEO Sanna Lukander, former Rovio's vice president of learning and book publishing, and co-founder , former Rovio's ‘Mighty Eagle’. Fun Academy is currently present in 9 countries across the world.\n\nIn January 2014, it was revealed that \"Angry Birds\" was considered a \"leaky app\" and was used to collect data about its users including their sexual orientation and location by the National Security Agency (NSA) and GCHQ. In retaliation, anti-NSA hackers defaced Rovio's Web site. Claims were made by Edward Snowden that the app was \"leaky\" and that they were capable of siphoning data.\n\nAccording to \"The Register\", the information was leaked through the in-game advertisement code like that embedded by Millennial Media: \"Millennial's tracking software generates a personal record for each user that can store information from their political affiliation and sexual orientation to whether their marital state was single, married, divorced, engaged or 'swinger'. This information is used to target in-app ads more effectively, and can be collected by UK and US intelligence agencies for analysis\". In a statement to the press, Rovio denied that they were providing any information to the intelligence agencies, but did not exclude the possibility that their advertisers might do so.\n\nFollowing this revelation, on 29 January, the Angry Birds site was defaced by hackers who replaced it with \"Spying Birds\" via a DNS hijacking attack. According to Rovio, \"The defacement was caught in minutes and corrected immediately\". The Syrian Electronic Army tweeted after the incident that the attack had been carried out by \"a friend\" of theirs.\n\n"}

{"id": "445871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=445871", "title": "Bikini waxing", "text": "Bikini waxing\n\nBikini waxing is the removal of pubic hair using a special wax, which can be hot or cold, that adheres to hairs and pulls them out when the wax is removed quickly from the skin, usually with a cloth strip. While the practice is mainly associated with women, male waxing is sometimes done to remove men's pubic hair.\n\nA bikini line is the area of the upper leg and inner thigh in which pubic hair grows that is normally not covered by the bottom part of a swimsuit. In some cultures, visible pubic hair in this region is disliked and/or considered embarrassing and so it is sometimes removed. However, some people remove pubic hair that will not be exposed for reasons like aesthetics, personal grooming and hygiene, culture, religion or fashion.\n\nPubic hair can be removed in a number of ways, such as waxing, shaving, sugaring, electrolysis, laser hair removal or with chemical depilatory creams. Waxing involves applying melted, usually hot, wax to the pubic hair that an individual would like to remove. The wax, which adheres to the hair as it hardens, is then covered with small strips of cloth. When the wax hardens sufficiently, the cloth is pulled off quickly, removing the hair from its roots as the wax is pulled away. Waxing can be performed on oneself privately using a home kit or by a cosmetologist at a salon or spa.\n\nIf a person has never been waxed before, or has not been waxed for a long time, it may be necessary to trim the pubic hair using scissors or an electric razor prior to waxing. A patch test is recommended, usually on the upper thigh, to test for allergies or skin sensitivities to the ingredients in the wax. Sometimes a hair growth inhibitor is applied after waxing, which slows the regrowth of hair if applied daily for an extended period of time.\n\nIt is common to apply an antiseptic cleaner and powder to the area prior to waxing. Wax is applied with a spatula in the direction of hair growth the size of a strip about wide and long. When the wax is set but still pliable, the wax strips are pulled away against the direction of hair growth while keeping the skin taut. The strip is ideally pulled off as swiftly as possible.\n\nThe pubic area is one of the most sensitive areas in the body and during the procedure special attention must be paid to avoid irritation. Pain directly resulting from the procedure can be slight or severe and can continue from several seconds to several minutes. Some people experience less pain during subsequent treatments. It can be helpful to take a mild anti-inflammatory medication (such as ibuprofen) an hour or so before waxing to reduce potential pain from the waxing. Products such as topical anesthetics are available to lessen the pain involved. A bikini wax during pregnancy is generally more painful, due to increased sensitivity. The type of wax used for bikini lines is often made from a mixture of beeswax and tall oil rather than the more common synthetic waxes used for waxing regular leg hair. Beeswax is considered stronger and more effective at removing the thicker and coarser pubic hair.\n\nSometimes bumps or in-grown hair can result from waxing. Isolated hairs can be removed with tweezers or electrolysis. Discomfort following the procedure generally lasts two to five days or less. Application of egg oil for a few days post-waxing can help moisturize the skin and reduce inflammation, pain or growth of bacteria. With repeated removal over time, pubic hair becomes weaker and grows more slowly, leading to easier removal with less pain and less frequent waxing.\n\nSome people modify their pubic hair either to fit in with societal trends or simply as an expression of their own style or lifestyle, while others object to any styling or do not practice it because of cost considerations.\n\nPubic hair may be styled into several basic styles which are often referred to by different names. The three major types are described below. Anthropologist Desmond Morris has identified other waxing styles:\n\n\n\"Natural\" (also known as \"au natural\" or \"bush\") refers to pubic hair that has not been removed, trimmed or styled at all. \"Trimmed\" or \"cut\" refers to pubic hair that has been shortened, but not completely removed other than shaving the inner thighs. Some women trim, but keep hair on their labia, while removing the pubic hair on the mons pubis. Salons often use their own unique names for common types of waxing, for example referring to a Brazilian with a \"landing strip\" as a \"Mohican\" or a \"Hollywood\" as \"Full Monty\".\n\n\"American waxing\" is the removal of only the pubic hair that is exposed by a swimsuit, depending on the style of the swimsuit. For a bikini, it would be hair at the top of the thighs and under the navel. It is also known as a \"basic bikini wax\", \"triangle\", or \"bikini line\", as it involves waxing hair from the sides to form a triangle so that pubic hair cannot be seen while wearing a swimsuit. Bikini bottoms or underwear are usually worn while getting an American wax. A normal American waxing job takes about 20 to 30 minutes to complete.\n\n\"French waxing\" (sometimes called a \"landing strip\" or a \"partial Brazilian wax\") leaves a vertical strip of pubic hair about wide and long just above the vulva. Hair around the anus area and labia may be removed. The landing strip wax has become popular with models who must wear garments of an extreme narrowness in the crotch region. To create the \"landing strip\" (a line of hair) practitioners and clients prefer either lying face up or lying face down. Sometimes hard wax is used, though strip wax works as effectively.\n\n\"Brazilian waxing\" is the removal of all pubic hair from the pelvic region, vulva, labia, perineum, and anus, while sometimes leaving a thin strip of hair on the mons pubis. It can be used by those who wear thong bikinis. Brazilian waxing is also known as a \"full Brazilian wax\", \"full bikini wax\", or the \"Hollywood wax\". This style was first called the Brazilian wax by the J. Sisters salon in Manhattan, founded in 1987 by seven sisters named Padilha from Brazil.\n\nBrazilian waxing is more controversial than other types of waxing. Like all waxing, it can be a physically painful experience during and after waxing. Some believe it is more unpleasant to receive cunnilingus from a bearded partner after getting a Brazilian wax. American actress-model Lisa Barbuscia commented negatively on her first experience getting a Brazilian at a Los Angeles salon popular with porn stars: \"It was so painful I collapsed. I only fainted, but I was nearly carted off to hospital and I have vowed never to try it again.\" Some critics of the procedure believe that Brazilian waxing can contribute to making an adult woman look underage, claiming that this may be one reason for its popularity in the sex industry. There is also a health risk involved if it is not done properly, as well as a risk of infection if done on a person with a weakened immune system.\n\nIn a 2016 the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study in which it was found that out of 3,316 American women surveyed, 84% reported a history of lifetime pubic hair grooming, with 59% reporting that the primary motivations for grooming were for hygienic purposes.\n\nBikini waxing has been credited with a significant global reduction in cases of pubic lice. However, the medical community has also seen a recent increase in folliculitis, or infection around the hair follicle, in women who wax or shave their bikini areas.\n\nIn Middle Eastern societies, removal of the female body hair has been considered proper hygiene, necessitated by local customs, for many centuries. In Islam, this is known as an act of \"fitrah\". According to ethnologist F. Fawcett, writing in 1901, he had observed the removal of body hair, including pubic hair about the vulva, as a custom of women from the Hindu Nair caste.\n\nIn Western societies, removal of female body hair (except for head hair, eyelashes and eyebrows) has traditionally been considered appropriate when it was visible. Visible pubic hair of women continues to be widely culturally disapproved and considered embarrassing, and so is at times removed.\n\nIn relation to pubic hair, with the reduction in the size of swimsuits, especially since the coming into fashion and popularity of the bikini since 1946, and the elimination of the skirt on swimsuits, the styling of pubic hair has also come into vogue. The practice to remove more pubic hair continued with the popularity or fashion of even briefer swimwear, such as the thong, which exposed the buttocks.\n\nChanges in lingerie styles also encouraged the removal of pubic hair, and the nude crotchi.e., the total removal of pubic hair, such as in a full Brazilian or the Sphinx stylebecame considered by many to be erotic and glamorous. A nude crotch is considered by some to be more youthful looking. According to Tschachler, Devine and Draxlbauer, removal of all visible body hair has come to be seen as an important aspect of femininity.\n\n\n"}

The Centre is independent of any university department but works with both the School of Arts and Humanities, and the School of Humanities and Social Sciences.\n\nFounded in 2001, CRASSH celebrated its 10th anniversary by welcoming professor Simon Goldhill as its new director and moving from Mill Lane, to the Alison Richard Building at 7 West Road, as well as inaugurating a new series of public lectures, which in 2011 were on The Idea of the University and in 2012 Understanding Society.\n\nAt beginning of 2012, CRASSH moved into the new Alison Richard building at the West Road gateway to the University’s Sidgwick Site, the main base for humanities and social science teaching and research at Cambridge. The building was designed by Nicholas Hare Architects and received a commendation at the 2013 Civic Trust Awards. The move into 7 West Road provides in-house space for larger conferences, but also creates greater interaction with old and new constituencies. The Centre’s relocation puts CRASSH alongside the major regional studies centres and POLIS, the Department of Politics and International Studies. The building is also home to Edmund de Waal's first piece of public sculpture, A Local History, a commission of three vitrines filled with porcelain and sunk into the pavement outside the building.\n\n\n\n\nCRASSH is home to numerous major, long-term research projects. The cluster of Early Modern related projects has ensured that CRASSH is one of the largest centres for Early Modern Studies in Europe.\n\n\nThe graduate/ faculty programme supports students and faculty working together around shared interdisciplinary research interests. The groups act as a barometer for disciplinary development and curriculum change. This programme is funded by the Isaac Newton Trust and the Andrew W Mellon.\n\nThe conference support programme functions as a showcase for arts, social sciences and humanities research in action. It provides the opportunity for Cambridge scholars to broker local and international collaborations. Recent and upcoming conferences include The Future University, Migration in Legal and Political Theory, Art, Memory and Dictatorship in Latin America, Languages of Citizenship in Translation, Still Architecture and Medieval Church Screens.\n\nThe Centre offers a number of programmes to bring scholars from all over the world to CRASSH: the fellowship schemes allow a community of scholars – from postdoctoral and early career researchers to more established visiting fellows – to interact in an interdisciplinary research environment.\n\nThe Centre reaches out globally through its Facebook site and through making available recordings of an increasing number of events online, in our Media Gallery and via the Cambridge YouTube and iTunesU channels:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The grito—a joyous Mexican shout—opens the festivities every year. This festival is a shared heritage celebration between the two border cities of Brownsville, Texas and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. The Charro Days festivals usually have about 50,000 attendants each year. This celebration includes the Sombrero Festival as well as a parade that goes down Elizabeth St. through Historic Downtown Brownsville, TX.\n\nThe festival was first organized and celebrated 1937 by the \"Brownsville Chamber of Commerce\" to recognize Mexican culture and honor the charros, or the \"dashing Mexican gentlemen cowboys.\" In addition, it is mentioned in the official webpage that the Charro Days festival was also created to bring people together during the effects of the Great Depression. Although not proven, it is rumored that the first “unofficial” Charro Days was realized in the early to mid-1800s, when people from the city of Brownsville, Texas, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas, just across the Rio Grande in Mexico, came together to celebrate a cooperative cultural festival to honor the two nations.\n\nThe four-day festival has daily parades, food stands and music, people dancing in the street, boat races, fireworks, bull fights, and a rodeo in Brownsville and in its sister city of Matamoros. \n\nCostumes reflecting Mexico's tradition have been used by those who partake in the occasion. Men, for the most part, wear traditional Mexican costumes—whether it is the charro costume or a cowboy one—while women wear the colorful Huipil costume. The traditional costume is often worn by adults, elders, and children on all four days to celebrate and honor borderland heroes.\n\nMr. Amigo Association, an organization that works for the friendly relationship with Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico and Brownsville, Texas, United States and to preserve the Charro Days and Sombrero Festival celebrations, became a part of Charro Days in 1967. Sombrero Fest, a three-day \"Washington Park\" street party with popular rock, country and Tejano performers, was added in 1986. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the first president of the Mr. Amigo Association was the former president of Mexico, Miguel Alemán Valdés.\n\nDuring the creation of NAFTA agreement in 1988-1989, Congressman Solomon Ortiz presented the Mr. Amigo Association with the Mr. Amigo Review Award for the distinction of being one of the first organizations to extend friendship and mutual understanding between the United States and Mexico. The Mr. Amigo Review Award remains on exhibit at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. as a model of bi-national friendliness between these two countries.\n\n\n"}

As a spin-off of other shows \"Chinese Characters Dictation Competition\" and \"Chinese Idioms Congress\", all characters within the games are in simplified Chinese.\n\nEvery episode of the show starts with quotations from a piece of classical Chinese poetry. By far ten pieces have been quoted. Note: the following pinyin tones show original, or standard pronunciation, not including tone sandhis on special syllables.\nIn the second season, the off-stage contestants no longer read poems, and the presenter of the show reads instead.\n\nThe show follows a two-part game. In the first part, there are 105 contestants competing, 5 that have done best in the previous episode on stage and 100 off stage (called \"百人团\", lit. \"hundred people team\"). The ones on stage select their set of ten questions one by one, and answer them in order. If they answer correctly in 10 seconds, the population that does incorrectly adds to their mark, otherwise their game is over. When a contestant's mark surpasses another's, the latter is eliminated.\n\nThe second part sees the best of the five challenging the contestant that has done best during the season, and they have to answer a series of more tough questions in order to win the challenge.\n\nThe second season introduces a more \"reasonable\" gameplay: every episode four contestants are selected from the hundred-contestants team, and follow part one from the first season; then the best of them has to challenge the fastest and most correct off-stage contestant to decide who would be the best of the episode, and may accept challenge from people that competes later. The first four contestants (in the opening episode) were chosen as the best performers of a non-broadcast written test and subsequent auditions.\n\nThe first round contains nine questions:\n\nEach of the two contestants must alternatively give two poem lines, containing a chosen character. The game ends when one of the two contestants cannot name another sentence.\n\nWinner of Round 2 and the returning champion play a best-of-nine final, all the questions are on the buzzer. First to score 5 points will be determined as the champion, and return for the next episode.\n\nThe presenter of \"Chinese Poetry Congress\" is Dong Qing, known for co-hosting CCTV New Year's Gala for years. She serves as both a host and a narrator. During a re-recording, Dong, by accident, fell off the stage and hurt her kneecap; however she insisted to continue recording under a cold compression, and eventually completed the show. Dong also performed reciting a poem in Shanghainese, singing Su Shi's \"Shui diao ge tou\", and quoting numerous Chinese idioms on air.\n\n\nThe people that answer questions off-stage are from all walks of life such as teachers, students, peasants and the police, not restricted to Chinese residents. The age ranges from 7 to 55. They follow the narrator's reciting opening poetry and count to the points that an on-stage contestant gets if their answer is incorrect. Due to the limited time of 10 seconds to answer on a tablet computer, a large quantity of contestants failed to complete verses that are usually taught in China's primary schools, for example Meng Haoran's \"Ode to the Willow\" (), leading to criticism on the team, as they were described as \"The regular studio audience\".\n\nIn the 22nd Shanghai Television Festival, \"Chinese Poetry Congress\" is awarded the best variety show.\n\nAll references are in Simplified Chinese except as otherwise stated.\n"}
{"id": "147235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147235", "title": "Chinese units of measurement", "text": "Chinese units of measurement\n\nChinese units of measurement, known in Chinese as the shìzhì (\"market system\"), are the traditional units of measurement of the Han Chinese. Although Chinese numerals have been decimal (base-10) since the Shang, several Chinese measures use hexadecimal (base-16). Local applications have varied, but the Chinese dynasties usually proclaimed standard measurements and recorded their predecessor's systems in their histories. \n\nIn the present day, the People's Republic of China maintains some customary units based upon the market units but standardized to round values in the metric system, for example the common \"jin\" or catty of exactly 500g. The Chinese name for most metric units is based on that of the closest traditional unit; when confusion might arise, the word \"market\" (, \"shì\") is used to specify the traditional unit and \"common\" or \"public\" (, \"gōng\") is used for the metric value. Taiwan, like Korea, saw its traditional units standardized to Japanese values and their conversion to a metric basis, such as the Taiwanese \"ping\" of about 3.306m² based on the square \"ken\". The Hong Kong SAR continues to use its traditional units, now legally defined based on a local equation with metric units. For instance, the Hong Kong catty is precisely 604.78982g.\n\nNote: The names \"lí\" () and \"fēn\" () for small units are the same for length, area, and mass; however, they refer to different kinds of measurements.\nAccording to the \"Liji\", the legendary Yellow Emperor created the first measurement units. The \"Xiao Erya\" and the \"Kongzi Jiayu\" state that length units were derived from the human body. According to the \"Records of the Grand Historian\", these human body units caused inconsistency, and Yu the Great, another legendary figure, unified the length measurements. Rulers with decimal units have been unearthed from Shang Dynasty tombs.\n\nIn the Zhou Dynasty, the king conferred nobles with powers of the state and the measurement units began to be inconsistent from state to state. After the Warring States period, Qin Shi Huang unified China, and later standardized measurement units. In the Han Dynasty, these measurements were still being used, and were documented systematically in the Book of Han.\n\nAstronomical instruments show little change of the length of chi in the following centuries, since the calendar needed to be consistent. It was not until the introduction of decimal units in the Ming Dynasty that the traditional system was revised.\n\nOn 7 January 1915, the Beiyang Government promulgated a measurement law to use not only metric system as the standard but also a set of Chinese-style measurement. On 16 February 1929, the Nationalist Government adopted and promulgated \"The Weights and Measures Act\" to adopt the metric system as the official standard and to limit the newer Chinese units of measurement () to private sales and trade in Article 11, effective on 1 January 1930.\n\nThe Government of the People's Republic of China continued using the market system along with metric system, as decreed by the State Council of the People's Republic of China on 25 June 1959, but 1 catty being 500 grams, would become divided into 10 (new) taels, instead of 16 (old) taels, to be converted from province to province, while exempting Chinese prescription drugs from the conversion to prevent errors.\n\nOn 27 February 1984, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decreed the market system to remain acceptable till the end of 1990 and ordered the transition to the national legal measures by that time, but farmland measures would be exempt from this mandatory metrication until further investigation and study.\n\nIn 1976 the Hong Kong Metrication Ordinance allowed a gradual replacement of the system in favor of the International System of Units (SI) metric system. The Weights and Measures Ordinance defines the metric, Imperial, and Chinese units. As of 2012, all three systems are legal for trade and are in widespread use.\n\nOn 24 August 1992, Macau published \"Law No. 14/92/M\" to order that Chinese units of measurement similar to those used in Hong Kong, Imperial units, and United States customary units would be permissible for five years since the effective date of the Law, 1 January 1993, on the condition of indicating the corresponding SI values, then for three more years thereafter, Chinese, Imperial, and US units would be permissible as secondary to the SI.\n\nTraditional units of length include the \"chi\" (), \"bu\" (), and \"li\" (). The precise length of these units, and the ratios between these units, has varied over time. 1 \"bu\" has consisted of either 5 or 6 \"chi\", while 1 \"li\" has consisted of 300 or 360 \"bu\".\n\nAll \"metric values\" given in the tables are exact unless otherwise specified by the approximation sign '~'.\n\nCertain units are also listed at List of Chinese classifiers → Measurement units.\n\nThe Chinese word for metre is \"mǐ\"; this can take the Chinese standard SI prefixes (for \"kilo-\", \"centi-\", etc.). A kilometre, however, may also be called \"gōnglǐ\", i.e. a metric \"lǐ\".\n\nIn the engineering field, traditional units are rounded up to metric units.For example, the Chinese word sī is used to express 0.01 mm.\nThese correspond to the measures listed simply as \"China\" in \"The Measures, Weights, & Moneys of All Nations\"\n\nMetric and other standard length units can be squared by the addition of the prefix \"píngfāng\". For example, a square kilometre is \"píngfāng gōnglǐ\".\n\nThese units are used to measure cereal grains, among other things. In imperial times, the physical standard for these was the jialiang.\n\nIn the case of volume, the market and metric \"shēng\" coincide, being equal to one litre as shown in the table. The Chinese standard SI prefixes (for \"milli-\", \"centi-\", etc.) may be added to this word \"shēng\".\n\nUnits of volume can also be obtained from any standard unit of length using the prefix \"lìfāng\" (\"cubic\"), as in \"lìfāng mǐ\" for a cubic metre.\n\nThese units are used to measure the mass of objects. They are also famous for measuring monetary objects such as gold and silver.\n\nThe Chinese word for gram is \"kè\"; this can take the Chinese standard SI prefixes (for \"milli-\", \"deca-\", etc.). A kilogram, however, is commonly called \"gōngjīn\", i.e. a metric \"jīn\".\n\nThese are used for trading precious metals such as gold and silver.\n\nAs there were hundreds of unofficial measures in use, the bibliography is quite vast. The editions of Wu Chenglou's 1937 \"History of Chinese Measurement\" were the usual standard up to the 1980s or so, but rely mostly on surviving literary accounts. Newer research has put more emphasis on archeological discoveries. Qiu Guangming & Zhang Yanming's 2005 bilingual \"Concise History of Ancient Chinese Measures and Weights\" summarizes these findings. A relatively recent and comprehensive bibliography, organized by period studied, has been compiled in 2012 by Cao & al.; for a shorter list, see Wilkinson's year 2000 \"Chinese History\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33536457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33536457", "title": "Crafts of India", "text": "Crafts of India\n\nThe crafts of India are diverse, rich in history ,culture \nand religion. The craft of each state in India reflect the influence of different empires. Throughout centuries, crafts have been embedded as a culture and tradition within rural communities.\n\nCrafts\n\nMetal Crafts includes metal work using Zinc, Copper, Brass, Silver, Gold. Some of the traditional ancient handicraft styles are Bidriware, Pembarthi Metal Craft, Dhokra, Kamrupi\n\nBihar , recognised by its Madhubani/Mithila Painting, Bhagalpur painting which is also known as Manjusha Art & extra ordinary delicacy of quilting.\n\nRajasthan, recognized by its Royal heritage is a prominent and well-established craft industry. Craft remains a tradition in Rajasthan, preserved over centuries by the stronghold of the Royal Rajput family. Within the craft industry are smaller occupations. These include, fabric colouration and embellishment, decorative painting and puppetry. Craft workers see this not as an occupation, but rather a mark of respect to their heritage. In the process of fabric colouration, woven fabrics are treated by methods such as tie-dyeing, resist dyeing and direct application. The dupatta worn by women show the popularity of dyeing. In 2008, traditional Jodhpur garments inspired designer Raghavendra Rathore's collection, Rathore Jodhpur. Fabric dyeing belongs to the Chippa caste of Rajasthan. Fabrics are embellished with mirror embroidery, symbolic to Rajasthan and wooden beading once dyed. The trend of mirror embroidery is also visible on dupattas in Punjab, known as the phulkari. Decorative patterns adorn all surfaces in Rajasthan. Interiors of homes are painted with floral motifs; similar bindi (dotted) designs are seen on garments. The clipped camel is unique to Rajasthan. In this, patterns are imprinted on the hide of the camel, taken place during the Pushkar and Nagaur festivals by the Rabari caste. Puppetry and theatre has remained a popular form of entertainment in Rajasthan. Recently, its popularity has reduced with increased interest in film and television amongst rural communities. The nat bhat caste produces these marionette style puppets. Facial expressions are painted on a mango wood head and the body is covered in decorative, Rajasthani clothing. The strings loosely bind the arms and torso together to give flexibility for movement. These puppets usually perform in legends and mythology conveying a moral message. The Rajasthani craft industry is iconic to the identity of India with many of its styles reaching the international market. Tie-dyeing is an example of how international fashion aesthetics have rooted from simple crafts methods of Rajasthan.\n\nGujarat is renowned for its textile production methods. Bordering Rajasthan, the two states share similarities in culture and identity. The ancient Indus Valley Civilization inhabited the entire region, including Rajasthan and Punjab during Medieval India. They embarked on this textile industry in Gujarat. Within textile production, each caste is assigned to an occupation of its own. These are, weaving, dyeing and printing. For example, the Salvi caste is assigned to weaving. Garment producers bring these elements together to form the identity of Gujarati textiles. Direct application is a method also symbolic to Gujarati garments. Paint and other applicants are used to form patterns on fabric for dupattas, ghagras (long skirt) and turbans. Block printing is a widely used form of direct application. In Bandhani, a unique Gujarati craft, fabric is tied at different sections before dyeing to create patterns. This foundation of forming patterns through dyeing has emerged from the rural communities of this state. Along with the complete image of a Gujarati woman are large bangles made of ivory and plastic, these are symbols of a married woman. Conch shell and shellac bangles are the most common. Conch shell bangles are plain white with a light shade of a brighter colour where as shellac bangles are shaped as a shell, painted and decorated with glitter. These have in recent years become an accessory in both domestic and international markets..\n\nTo the far eastern region of India is Assam. A state recognized for its creative use of raw materials in textiles and crafts. Assam was one of the states whose craftwork was exhibited in the National Handicrafts and Handborn Museum in 2010, showcased to first lady, Michelle Obama. Production of silk fabrics is iconic of Assamese textiles. Silk is the most valued raw material of Assam, with the Antheraea assama worm producing the unique muga silk. It is mostly the duty of women to construct silk fabrics, using a domestic backstrap loom. Mahatma Gandhi had noted ‘Assamese women are born weavers, they weave fairy-tales in their cloth’. Domestic weaving is an important craft for Assamese women, their marriage and future is seen as reliant upon this skill. At some stage, an unmarried girl would present a hand made bihuan to her beloved. Weaving holds a significant moral and cultural value in Assam. The silk and textile industry is also an economic resource to the state with over 25000 families associated with this craft. Cane and bamboo crafts are also unique to Assam, the result of heavy physical work. Ridang, suli, lezai and long cane are a natural resource to the state. The finest cane is chopped and reduced to thin strips then woven into sheets. It is attached to the frame of a furniture piece, usually made out of bamboo sticks. They are also used as mats, providing comfort in summer. The trend of this sitalpati mat is also seen in Punjab in which a woven mat attached to a frame becomes a charpai. The crafts of Assam are reliant upon the raw materials of the state also making them unique.\n\nThe diversity of religious beliefs has had a great impact on the crafts of Southern India. The region has seen the rule of various empires such as the Mughal, Portuguese, Dutch, French and British. Each has left their mark of style on traditional crafts. The craft industry of South India has established itself commercially in the nation, whilst reflecting a long history of foreign rule. Dravidian style, stone carved temples reflect the influence of Hinduism whilst Roman Catholic churches echo the impact of the British rule. Temple carvings are symbolic of the craft skills in the Tamil Nadu region. The Meenakshi temple of Madurai typifies the skills and devotion put into this craftwork. Each section of the temple is a sacred shrine to a deity. North of Tamil Nadu is Karnataka, a region renowned for its wood and stone craftwork. The forests of this region provide extensive supplies of raw materials, mostly rosewood. For wood workers, crafting statues for large temples is a major source of income. The forms of characters from Hindu mythology are carefully shaped with a chisel. Soapstone is also commonly used to carve statues giving them a unique textural quality and smooth finish.\n\nThe crafts of India have been valued throughout time; their existence today proves the efforts put into their preservation. Contemporary designers such as Ritu Kumar and Ritu Virani are constantly embedding traditional crafts into their designs. Also, there is a complete educational institute, Indian Institute of Crafts and Design (IICD) which is established in Jaipur, Rajasthan, which mainly educates for the crafts and their existence with design. Despite these efforts, the roots of these crafts, which are the rural craftsmen, are in decline. This argued by the India Foundation for the Arts organisation. Rising costs of materials and supplies have placed many of these craft communities in financial struggle. A recent article in the Times of India predicts the price of steel to rise between Rs 600 and 1000 per tonne. On the other hand, statistics from the All India Handicrafts Board show that craft export has risen from 23 crores to over 9000 crores since the past 50 years. With rising economic and political issues in India, the craft sector is struggling to uphold. Although an interest to retain the culture of crafts is seen in designers and institutions.\nHandicrafts are the creative products made by the skill of the hand without the help of modern machinery and equipment. Nowadays, hand-made products are considered to be a fashion statement and an item of luxury.\n\nIndia’s rich cultural heritage and centuries of evolutionary tradition is manifested by the huge variety of handicrafts made all over the country. Handicrafts are a mirror of the cultural identity of the ethnic people who make it. Through the ages, handicrafts made in India like the Kashmiri woollen carpets, Zari embroidered fabrics, terracotta and ceramic products, silk fabrics etc. have maintained their exclusiveness. In the ancient times, these handicrafts were exported to far off countries of Europe, Africa, West Asia and Far East via the ‘silk route’. The entire wealth of timeless Indian handicrafts has survived through the ages. These crafts carry the magnetic appeal of the Indian culture that promises exclusivity, beauty, dignity and style.\n\n"}
{"id": "23625500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23625500", "title": "Critical Psychiatry Network", "text": "Critical Psychiatry Network\n\nThe Critical Psychiatry Network (CPN) is a psychiatric organization based in the United Kingdom. It was created by a group of British psychiatrists who met in Bradford, England in January 1999 in response to proposals by the British government to amend the 1983 Mental Health Act (MHA). They expressed concern about the implications of the proposed changes for human rights and the civil liberties of people with mental health illness. Most people associated with the group are practicing consultant psychiatrists in the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS), among them Dr Joanna Moncrieff. A number of non-consultant grade and trainee psychiatrists are also involved in the network.\n\nParticipants in the Critical Psychiatry Network share concerns about psychiatric practice where and when it is heavily dependent upon diagnostic classification and the use of psychopharmacology. These concerns reflect their recognition of poor construct validity amongst psychiatric diagnoses and scepticism about the efficacy of anti-depressants, mood stabilisers and anti-psychotic agents. According to them, these concerns have ramifications in the area of the use of psychiatric diagnosis to justify civil detention and the role of scientific knowledge in psychiatry, and an interest in promoting the study of interpersonal phenomena such as relationship, meaning and narrative in pursuit of better understanding and improved treatment.\n\nCPN has similarities and contrasts with earlier criticisms of conventional psychiatric practice, for example those associated with David Cooper, R. D. Laing and Thomas Szasz. Features of CPN are pragmatism and full acknowledgment of the suffering commonly associated with mental health difficulties. As a result, it functions primarily as a forum within which practitioners can share experiences of practice, and provide support and encouragement in developing improvements in mainstream NHS practice where most participants are employed.\n\nCPN maintains close links with service user or survivor led organisations such as the Hearing Voices Network, Intervoice and the Soteria Network, and with like-minded psychiatrists in other countries. It maintains its own website. The network is open to any sympathetic psychiatrist, and members meet in person, in the UK, twice a year. It is primarily intended for psychiatrists and psychiatric trainees and full participation is not available to other groups.\n\nCPN is concerned with a number of issues, including the problem of coercion and the role of psychiatry in social control, the role of biological science in psychiatry, and the implications of the decontextualisation of experience in psychiatry.\n\nCPN recognises that the practice of psychiatry in Britain involves a delicate balance between respecting individual rights and freedoms, and the need to protect other people. The publication of the British Government’s green paper containing proposals to amend the 1983 MHA raised serious concerns within the CPN that the balance would shift too far in the direction of public protection, thus emphasizing the social control function of psychiatry. The green paper contained two proposals that raised particular concern for members of CPN. One involved the introduction of new legislation to enable psychiatrists to detain indefinitely people with so-called dangerously severe personality disorders (DSPD), even though they had not committed or been convicted of an offence.\n\nThe other involved the introduction of community treatment orders (CTOs) to make it possible to treat people against their wishes in the community. CPN submitted evidence to the Scoping Group set up by the government under Professor Genevra Richardson. This set out ethical and practical objections to CTOs, and ethical and human rights objections to the idea of reviewable detention. It was also critical of the concept of personality disorder as a diagnosis in psychiatry. In addition, CPN’s evidence called for the use of advance statements, crisis cards and a statutory right to independent advocacy as ways of helping to sustain autonomy at times of crisis. CPN also responded to government consultation on the proposed amendment, and the white paper.\n\nThe concern about these proposals caused a number of organizations to come together under the umbrella of the Mental Health Alliance to campaign in support of the protection of patients’ and carers’ rights, and to minimise coercion. CPN joined the Alliance’s campaign, but resigned in 2005 when it became clear that the Alliance would accept those aspects of the House of Commons Scrutiny Committee’s report that would result in the introduction of CTOs. Psychiatrists not identified with CPN shared the Network’s concern about the more coercive aspects of the government’s proposals, so CPN carried out a questionnaire survey of over two and a half thousand (2,500) consultant psychiatrists working in England seeking their views of the proposed changes. The responses (a response rate of 46%) indicated widespread concern in the profession about reviewable detention and CTOs.\n\nThe CPN was paid attention by Thomas Szasz who wrote: “Members of the CPN, like their American counterparts, criticize the proliferation of psychiatric diagnoses and ‘excessive’ use of psychotropic drugs, but embrace psychiatric coercions.”\n\nThere is a general concern in CPN about the dominant role played by biological science in contemporary psychiatry. It is concerned with two aspects of the use of science in psychiatry. One relates to the improper use of scientific evidence by the pharmaceutical industry and those psychiatrists with links to it. The other concerns the limitations of biological science in understanding distress and madness.\n\nThere is a strong view by CPN that contemporary psychiatry relies too much on the medical model, and attaches too much importance to a narrow biomedical view of diagnosis. This can, in part, be understood as the response of an earlier generation of psychiatrists to the challenge of what has been called ‘anti-psychiatry’. Psychiatrists such as David Cooper, R. D. Laing and Thomas Szasz (although the latter two rejected the term) were identified as part of a movement against psychiatry in the 1960s and 1970s. Stung by these attacks, as well as accusations that in any case psychiatrists could not even agree who was and who was not mentally ill, academic psychiatrists responded by stressing the biological and scientific basis of psychiatry through strenuous efforts to improve the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis based in a return to the traditions of one of the founding fathers of the profession, Emil Kraepelin. This signaled the rise of what has been called neo-Kraepelinianism as evident in DSM-III and DSM-IV.\n\nThe use of standardized diagnostic criteria and checklists may have improved the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis, but the problem of its validity remains. The investment of huge sums of money in Britain, America and Europe over the last half-century has failed to reveal a single, replicable difference between a person with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and someone who does not have the diagnosis. The case for the biological basis of common psychiatric disorders such as depression has also been greatly over-stated. This has a number of consequences:\n\nFirst, the aggrandisement of biological research creates a false impression both inside and outside the profession of the credibility of the evidence used to justify drug treatments for disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Reading clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of depression, for example, such as that produced for the UK National Health Service by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), one might be fooled into believing that the evidence for the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is established beyond question. In reality this is not the case, as re-examinations of drug trial data in meta-analyses, especially where unpublished data are included (publication bias means that researchers and drug companies do not publish negative findings for obvious commercial reasons), have revealed that most of the benefits seen in active treatment groups are also seen in the placebo groups. NICE itself says that the difference between antidepressant medication and placebo is not clinically significant, yet continues to recommend them.\n\nAs far as schizophrenia is concerned, neuroleptic drugs may have some short-term effects, but it is not the case that these drugs possess specific ‘anti-psychotic’ properties, and it is impossible to assess whether or not they confer advantages in long-term management of psychoses because of the severe disturbances that occur when people on long-term active treatment are withdrawn to placebos. These disturbances are traditionally interpreted as a ‘relapse’ of schizophrenia when in fact there are several possible interpretations for the phenomenon.\n\nAnother consequence of the domination of psychiatry by biological science is that the importance of contexts in understanding distress and madness is played down. This has a number of consequences. First, it obscures the true nature of what in fact are extremely complex problems. For example, if we consider depression to be a biological disorder remediable through the use of antidepressant tablets, then we may be excused from having to delve into the tragic circumstances that so often lie at the heart the experience. This is so in adults and children. To disregard the reality of suffering in this way is ethically unacceptable both for critical psychiatrists and many patients, who reject the idea that their experiences are to be explained in terms of psychiatric symptoms, and putative biochemical disturbances.\n\nThere is a common theme, here, with the work of David Ingleby whose chapter in Critical Psychiatry: The Politics of Mental Health sets out a detailed critique of positivism (the view that epistemology, or knowledge about the world is best served by empiricism and the scientific method rather than metaphysics). A common theme running through Laingian antipsychiatry, Ingleby’s critical psychiatry, contemporary critical psychiatry and postpsychiatry is the view that social, political and cultural realities play a vital role in helping us to understand the suffering and experience of madness. Like Laing, Ingleby stressed the importance of hermeneutics and interpretation in inquiries about the meaning of experience in psychiatry, and (like Laing) he drew on psychoanalysis as an interpretative aid, but his work was also heavily influenced by the critical theory of the Frankfurt School.\n\nBoth critical and post psychiatry are concerned with the way in which interest in hermeneutics has waned in late twentieth century psychiatry. There is within critical psychiatry a variety of views about the relevance of psychoanalysis. One strand of thought is that psychoanalysis itself does not possess any special knowledge of the mind; others value the hermeneutic role of psychoanalytic theory, if not practice, as a way of taking social and cultural factors into account in understanding experience. There are many factors responsible for the waning of interest in hermeneutics in mainstream psychiatry, including the ascendancy of clinical neuroscience, the preoccupation with an increasingly narrow, ‘neo-Kraepelinian’ view of diagnosis, and the waning influence of psychodynamic and other forms of insight-orientated psychotherapy. In addition, there is a long-established tradition in clinical psychiatry that sees limits in the extent to which it is possible to understand experience in schizophrenia. In part this may be traced back to the work of the German psychiatrist and philosopher, Karl Jaspers, and his interpretation of Edmund Husserl’s phenomenology.Jaspers’ work was enormously influential in twentieth century psychiatry. His view of phenomenology is one that dwells on the ‘form’ of experience rather than its content, and thus separates it from the contexts that help to render experience meaningful. Thus it has been argued that the ‘unnunderstandability’ of some psychotic experiences primarily relates to the way in which psychiatrists, informed by Jaspers, approach experience. If we regard phenomenology as a ‘rigorous science’ of human experience as did Jaspers, and focus on the form of experience, then it will be inevitable that meaning and understandability will be of lesser consequence.\n\nThe most forceful critic of this view was R. D. Laing, who famously attacked the approach enshrined by Jaspers’ and Kraepelin’s work in chapter two of The Divided Self, proposing instead an existential-phenomenological basis for understanding psychosis. Laing always insisted that schizophrenia is more understandable than is commonly supposed. Mainstream psychiatry has never accepted Laing’s ideas, but many in CPN regard The Divided Self as central to twentieth century psychiatry. Laing’s influence continued in America through the work of the late Loren Mosher, who worked at the Tavistock Clinic in the mid-1960s, when he also spent time in Kingsley Hall witnessing Laing’s work. Shortly after his return to the USA, Loren Mosher was appointed Director of Schizophrenia Research at the National Institute of Mental Health, and also the founding editor of the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin.\n\nOne of his most notable contributions to this area was setting up and evaluating the first Soteria House, an environment modeled on Kingsley Hall in which people experiencing acute psychoses could be helped with minimal drug use and a form of interpersonal phenomenology influenced by Heidegger. He also conducted evaluation studies of the effectiveness of Soteria. A recent systematic review of the Soteria model found that it achieved as good, and in some areas, better, clinical outcomes with much lower levels of medication (Soteria House was not anti-medication) than conventional approaches to drug treatment.\n\nThere is currently no research base for the efficacy of the critical psychiatry approach.\n\nOne comparison study showed 34% of patients of a 'medical model' team were still being treated after two years, compared with only 9% of patients of a team using a 'non-diagnostic' approach (less medication, little diagnosis, individual treatment plans tailored to the person's unique needs). However the study comments that cases may have left the system in the 'non-diagnostic' approach, not because treatment had worked, but because (1) multi-agency involvement meant long-term work may have been continued by a different agency, (2) the starting question of ‘Do we think our service can make a positive difference to this young person’s life?’ rather than ‘What is wrong with this young person?’ may have led to treatment not being continued, and (3) the attitude of viewing a case as problematic when no improvement has occurred after five sessions may have led to treatment not being continued (rather than the case ‘drifting’ on in the system).\n\nPeter Campbell first used the term ‘postpsychiatry’ in the anthology \"Speaking Our Minds\", which imagines what would happen in a world after psychiatry. Independently, Patrick Bracken and Philip Thomas coined the word later and used it as the title of a series of articles written for Openmind. This was followed by a key paper in the British Medical Journal and a book of the same name. This culminated with the publication by Bradley Lewis, a psychiatrist based in New York, of \"Moving Beyond Prozac, DSM, and the New Psychiatry: The Birth of Postpsychiatry\".\n\nA significant developments in mental health over the last thirty years has been the emergence of vocal and critical service-users and survivor movements.Examples of such organisations include \"Survivors Speak Out\", the \"National Self Harm Network\", \"Mad Pride\", \"Mad Women\" and the\" Hearing Voices Network.\" British postpsychiatry can be understood as an attempt to respond to these groups Although these groups disagree on many issue with mainstream psychiatry, and instead seek a more equal relationship with mental health services. These groups were supported by the Labour government commitment to democracy and accountability in the NHS on its election in 1997. This created a political environment in which doctors and nurses in all areas of health care were expected to relinquish paternalistic ways of relating to patients and relatives, and to work with them on a more equal footing.\n\nFor Bracken and Thomas, postpsychiatry represents an attempt to move beyond the dichotomies that characterised the anti-psychiatry era, and to engage constructively and positively with the concerns of service users and carers. Postpsychiatry identifies the central problem of the mental health field not necessarily in psychiatry, but in the modernist search for technical solutions to life's problems. This modernist impulse drives changes in psychiatry, psychology and nursing. It existed before the biological or DSM shift of the 1980s, and has been skillfully manipulated by the pharmaceutical industry subsequently. (citation needed)\n\nAccording to Bracken, progress in the field of mental health is presented in terms of 'breakthrough drugs', ‘wonders of neuroscience', ‘the Decade of the Brain’ and 'molecular genetics'. These developments suited the interests of a relatively small number of academic psychiatrists, many of whom have interests in the pharmaceutical industry, although so far the promised insights into psychosis and madness were yet to be realized. Some psychiatrists have turned to another form of technology, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, although this does draw attention to the person’s relationship with their experiences (such as voices or unusual beliefs), and focuses on helping them to find different ways of coping, it however, it is based on a particular set of assumptions about the nature of the self, the nature of thought, and how reality is constructed. The pros and cons of this have been explored in some detail in a recent publication.\n\nFraming mental health problems as 'technical' in nature involves prioritising technology and expertise over values, relationships and meanings, the very things that emerge as important for service users, both in their narratives, and in service user-led research. For many service users these issues are of primary importance. Recent meta-analyses into the effectiveness of antidepressants and cognitive therapy in depression confirm that non-specific, non-technical factors (such as the quality of the therapeutic relationship as seen by the patient, and the placebo effect in medication) are more important than the specific factors.\n\nPostpsychiatry tries to move beyond the view that we can only help people through technologies and expertise. Instead, it \nprioritises values, meanings and relationships and sees progress in terms of engaging creatively with the service user movement, and communities. This is especially important given the considerable evidence that in Britain, Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) communities are particularly poorly served by mental health services. For this reason an important practical aspect of postpsychiatry is the use of community development in order to engage with these communities. The community development project Sharing Voices Bradford is an excellent example of such an approach.\n\nThere are many commonalities between critical psychiatry and postpsychiatry, but it is probably fair to say that whereas postpsychiatry would broadly endorse most aspects of the work of critical psychiatry, the obverse does not necessarily hold. In identifying the modernist privileging of technical responses to madness and distress as a primary problem, postpsychiatry has looked to postmodernist thought for insights. Its conceptual critique of traditional psychiatry draws on ideas from philosophers such as Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Foucault and Wittgenstein.\n\nPostpsychiatry is not anti-science, but is critical of the dualism implicit in Cartesianism, body-mind, mind-society, and body-society, and thus the failure of medical science to engage fully with the embodied and encultured reality of human experience in disease and illness. The Critical Psychiatry Network or movement on the other hand encompasses a range of philosophical positions and is not conceptually wedded to postmodernism. Members of the Network are particularly concerned with the political and ethical basis of the clinical practice of psychiatry, and countering the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on the psychiatric profession and mental health care in general. At root, there is a conceptual issue about the nature of mental illness. Critical psychiatry and postpsychiatry maintain that psychiatry can be practiced without postulating brain pathology as the basis for functional mental illness.\n\nThe word anti-psychiatry is associated with the South African psychiatrist David Cooper, who used it to refer to the ending of the ‘game’ the psychiatrist plays with his or her victim (patient). It has been widely used to refer to the writings and activities of a small group of psychiatrists, most notably R.D. Laing, Aaron Esterson, Cooper, and Thomas Szasz (although he rejects the use of the label in relation to his own work, as did Laing and Esterson), and sociologists (Thomas Scheff). Szasz discards even more what he calls the quackery of ‘antipsychiatry’ than the quackery of psychiatry.\n\nAnti-psychiatry can best be understood against the counter-cultural context in which it arose. The decade of the 1960s was a potent mix of student rebellion, anti-establishment sentiment and anti-war (Vietnam) demonstrations. It saw the rise to prominence of feminism and the Civil Rights movement in the USA and Northern Ireland. Across the world, formerly colonised peoples were throwing off the shackles of colonialism. Some of these themes emerged in the Dialectics of Liberation, a conference organized by Laing and others in the Round House in London in 1968. As far as psychiatry is concerned, we have already seen how, in The Divided Self, Laing argued for an existential (or hermeneutic) phenomenology as the basis for understanding and helping people with schizophrenia, an influence that can be seen in the work of Loren Mosher and Soteria in America. Recent years have seen the emergence of a Soteria Network in Britain to promote the development of minimum drug therapeutic environments for people experiencing psychosis, an initiative supported by some involved with CPN.\n\nAnti-psychiatry as practiced by Laing and Cooper, that is, anti-psychiatry as an approach to psychiatry, or as a school of psychoanalysis, might today be better subsumed under the category Critical Psychiatry. Anti-psychiatry itself however, that is, the prefix anti attached to the word psychiatry, and meaning a movement against, or in opposition to, the field of psychiatry itself is still very much alive and kicking, and it is certainly no throwback to the sixties. Anti-psychiatry activists today include psychiatric survivors and dissident professionals who are not afraid to oppose the practice of psychiatry, with its cozy relationship to the pharmaceutical industry, and its monitoring function on behalf of government, and who envision an end to the field of psychiatry itself, or, at the very least, an end to harmful and coercive psychiatric practices. The thing these activists call for, rather than an endless cycle of reforms, some more repressive, some less, is the complete and total abolition of forced psychiatric treatment. Today, although mostly a movement of activists with centers notably in Toronto, New York, and London, antipsychiatry is returning to academia as a field of study and critique. This is exemplified at OISE, the University of Toronto, with the recent endowment of the Bonnie Burstow Antipsychiatry Scholarship for students engaging in Masters and PhD level research.\n\nCPN is involved in four main areas of work, writing and the publication of academic and other papers, organizing and participating in conferences, activism and support. A glance at the members’ publication page on the CPN website reveals in excess of a hundred papers, books and other articles published by people associated with the network over the last twelve years or so. These cover a wide range of topics, from child psychiatry, psychotherapy, the role of diagnosis in psychiatry, critical psychiatry, philosophy and postpsychiatry, to globalization and psychiatry. CPN has also organized a number of conferences in the past, and continues to do so in collaboration with other groups and bodies. It has run workshops for psychiatrists and offers peer supervision face to face and via videolink. It also supports service user and survivor activists who campaign against the role of the pharmaceutical industry in psychiatry, and the campaign for the abolition of the schizophrenia label. The CPN has published a statement in support. It has formal links with the Hearing Voices Network.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of CPN’s work has been that of mutual support. In recent years it has become increasingly difficult to practise psychiatry flexibly, in ways that recognize the limitations of the scientific evidence that underpins a great deal of contemporary psychiatry. There are many reasons for this, including the rise of evidence-based medicine and the risk-averse culture in which we live. Consequently, anyone whose practice is seen to diverge even modestly from clinical practice guidelines is likely to attract unwelcome attention, criticism from peers and managers, or worse. It has thus become increasingly difficult to hold views that differ from what is claimed to be mainstream opinion, even though there are legitimate grounds for doing so based in carefully argued critiques of existing evidence. For example, many critical psychiatrists are highly sceptical about the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs and other forms of physical treatments, the use of diagnoses such as schizophrenia, or the use of the Mental Health Act in social control. CPN thus has a vital role in justifying and supporting those who espouse a critical position in relation to psychiatric theory and practice, and in recent years has supported a number of colleagues who have fallen foul of their peers because their work is wrongly seen not to follow clinical practice guidelines. This is one of the main reasons why membership is restricted to psychiatrists.\n\nPsychiatrists from USA, Canada, Australia, with similar understanding regarding mental health issues have joined the UK CPN creating The International Critical Psychiatry Network (ICPN).\n\n\n\n"}

Among their roles was the provision of libraries and reading rooms, but as community institutions they also provided lectures and adult education.\n\nThe 'School of Arts' movement began in Britain in the beginning of the nineteenth century. The first School of Arts opened in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1821, with others in Glasgow and London in 1823. The first Mechanics' Institute was established in Glasgow in 1821.\n\nThe first such institution in Australia was the \"Van Diemen's Land Mechanics' Institute\", Hobart, which opened in 1827. This was soon followed by the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts in 1833. By 1900 there were 1000 Mechanics' Institutes in Australia with memberships of between 100 and 200 people. Most of these Institutes did not have large libraries, usually having less than 1,000 books. Their role in a country town was more a general focus for the community's cultural activities, not just that of a library. As well as membership subscriptions, the Institutes were supported by colonial governments and sometimes by local government, usually by land grants and cash assistance. The institution generally had a purpose built building in the town. Many of these buildings are no longer home to those institutions but are used for other purposes.\n\nThe first Mechanics' Institute founded in Victoria was in Melbourne in 1839. The Institute at Portland was founded in 1843 and Geelong's Institute in 1846. Institutes were established at Beechworth, Kyneton, Prahran and Sandhurst (later known as Bendigo) in 1854, Castlemaine and Eldorado in 1855, Footscray in 1857, Ballarat and Creswick in 1859, Berwick in 1862, and Maldon in 1863. The increasing numbers of Mechanics' institutes in Victoria seems to have been a consequence of the expansion of settlement, in particular associated with the gold rushes, rather than from meeting any specific cultural, educational or recreational need. The Victorian government between 1860 and 1895 spent around £220,000 on grants. The increase in the number of institutes founded after 1860, especially in the country areas, was a direct result of the grants which were made available. The conditions attached to the grant, for the purchase of books and for public access, was influential in making the library the main activity of the institutes and achieved the aim of allowing many Victorians in the late 19th century to enjoy access to a reasonable library service.\n\nIn 1912, a New South Wales committee was set up to examine whether the £10,000 subsidy paid annually by the government to Schools of Arts and similar institutions was money well spent. The committee determined it was not well spent and recommended phasing out or reducing the subsidy in metropolitan areas and municipalities and that local authorities take over schools of arts. There were not enough books, especially non-fiction, and services were limited under the current arrangements. However, lobbying saw the recommendations not implemented. Subsidies continued until the 1930s depression.\n\nVery few of these cultural institutions have survived to this day, their roles having been assumed by government organisations such as public libraries and TAFE. They have however left behind many historical buildings in cities and towns throughout Australia, some of which have been converted into community halls. For instance, over 1,200 Mechanics' Institutes were built in Victoria but just over 500 remain today, and only six still operate their lending library services.\n\n"}

{"id": "13087901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13087901", "title": "Ethnoreligious group", "text": "Ethnoreligious group\n\nAn ethnoreligious group (or ethno-religious group) is an ethnic group whose members are also unified by a common religious background.\n\nIn general ethnoreligious communities define their ethnic identity not only by ancestral heritage nor simply by religious affiliation but normally through a combination of both. An ethnoreligious group has a shared history and a cultural tradition - which can be defined as religious - of its own. In many cases ethnoreligious groups are ethno-cultural groups with a traditional ethnic religion; in other cases ethnoreligious groups begin as communities united by a common faith which through endogamy developed cultural and ancestral ties. The legal assignement what is an ethnoreligious group can differ from the above given definition.\n\nSome ethnoreligious groups' identities are reinforced by the experience of living within a larger community as a distinct minority. Ethnoreligious groups can be tied to ethnic nationalism if the ethnoreligious group possesses a historical base in a specific region. In many ethnoreligious groups emphasis is placed upon religious endogamy, and the concurrent discouragement of interfaith marriages or intercourse, as a means of preserving the stability and historical longevity of the community and culture.\n\nPrior to the Babylonian exile the Israelites had already emerged as an ethnoreligious group, probably before the time of Hosea.\n\nSince the 19th century Reform Judaism has adopted theology that differs from traditional Judaism, although in recent years the reform movement has readopted some traditional practices. By the end of the 20th century the reform movement had become dominant in the United States. In the United States rising mixed marriage rates has lead to attempts to facilitate conversion of the spouse. Despite conversion in order to facilitate marriage being strongly discouraged by traditional Jewish law. If the spouse does not convert the reform movement will recognize paternal descent. Traditional Jews only recognizes descent along the maternal line. Many children of mixed marriages do not identify as Jews and the reform movement only recognizes children of mixed marriages as Jewish if they \"established through appropriate and timely public and formal acts of identification with the Jewish faith and people.\"\n\nSince the mid 1960s Israeli national identity has become inexorably linked with Jewish identity. In recent years some anti-Zionists have adopted a variety of theories intent on proving that contemporary Jews are descendants of converts. Which in their view would render Zionism a form of modern irrational racism. While at the same time severing Jewish ties to the Land of Israel. In Israel Jewish religious courts have authority over personal status matters which has lead to friction with secular Jews who sometimes find they must leave the country in order to marry or divorce. Particularly relating to the inherited status of mamzer, the marriage of males from the priestly line, persons not recognized as Jewish by the rabbinate and agunot. The Israeli rabbinate only recognizes certain approved Orthodox rabbis as legitimate which has lead to friction with Diaspora Jews who for centuries never had an overarching authority.\n\nOther classical examples for ethnoreligious groups are traditional Anabaptist groups like the Old Order Amish, the Hutterites, the Old Order Mennonites and traditional groups of German speaking Mennonites from Russia, like the Old Colony Mennonites. All these groups have a shared German background, a shared German dialect as their every day language (Pennsylvania German, Hutterisch, Plautdietsch) and a shared version of their Anabaptist faith, a shared history of several hundred years and they have accepted very few outsiders into their communities in the last 250 years. Modern proselytizing Mennonite groups, like e.g. the Evangelical Mennonite Conference whose members have lost their shared ancestry, their common ethnic language Plautdietsch, their traditional dress and other typical ethnic traditions, are not seen as ethnoreligious groups anymore.\n\nIn Australian law, the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 of New South Wales defines \"race\" to include \"ethnic, ethno-religious or national origin\". The reference to \"ethno-religious\" was added by the Anti-Discrimination (Amendment) Act 1994 (NSW). John Hannaford, the NSW Attorney-General at the time, explained, \"The effect of the latter amendment is to clarify that ethno-religious groups, such as Jews, Muslims and Sikhs, have access to the racial vilification and discrimination provisions of the Act... extensions of the Anti-Discrimination Act to ethno-religious groups will not extend to discrimination on the ground of religion\".\n\nThe definition of \"race\" in Anti-Discrimination Act 1998 (Tas) likewise includes \"ethnic, ethno-religious or national origin\". However, unlike the NSW Act, it also prohibits discrimination on the grounds of \"religious belief or affiliation\" or \"religious activity\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom the landmark legal case \"Mandla v Dowell-Lee\" placed a legal definition on ethnic groups with religious ties, which, in turn, has paved the way for the definition of an ethnoreligious group. Both Jews and Sikhs were determined to be considered ethnoreligious groups under the Anti-Discrimination (Amendment) Act 1994 (see above).\n\nThe Anti-Discrimination (Amendment) Act 1994 made reference to \"Mandla v Dowell-Lee\", which defined ethnic groups as:\n\n\nThe significance of the case was that groups like Sikhs and Jews could now be protected under the Race Relations Act 1976.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "268938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=268938", "title": "Francis Parker Yockey", "text": "Francis Parker Yockey\n\nFrancis Parker Yockey (September 18, 1917 – June 16, 1960) was an American attorney, political philosopher, and polemicist best known for his neo-Spenglerian book Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics, published under the pen name Ulick Varange in 1948. This book, described in its introduction as a \"sequel\" to Spengler's The Decline of the West, argues for a culture-based, totalitarian path for the preservation of Western culture.\n\nYockey actively supported many far-right causes around the world and remains one of the seminal influences of many white nationalist and New Right movements. Yockey was a passionate proponent of antisemitism, and expressed a reverence for German National Socialism, and a general affinity for fascist causes. Yockey contacted or worked with the Nazi-aligned Silver Shirts and the German-American Bund. After the defeat of the Axis in World War II, Yockey became even more active in neo-Fascist causes.\n\nYockey believed that the United States was an engine of liberalism, controlled by Zionist Jews. Yockey also met Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, and wrote anti-Zionist propaganda on behalf of the Egyptian government, seeing the pan-Arab nationalist movement as another ally to challenge \"the Jewish-American power.\" While in prison for falsified passports, he was visited by American right-winger Willis Carto, who ultimately became the chief advocate and publisher of Yockey's writings.\n\nMany biographical facts about Yockey cannot be known with absolute certainty. The majority comes from the accounts of those who knew him and from FBI efforts to gain intelligence in regard to his activities, as recorded by his biographer Kevin Coogan in his book \"Dreamer of the Day: Francis Parker Yockey and the Postwar Fascist International.\"\nYockey was born in Chicago, Illinois, the youngest of four siblings, but his family returned to their original homestead in Ludington, Michigan during the Great Depression. His parents were Anglophiles who raised Yockey to appreciate Europe and high culture. Subsequently, Yockey's mother introduced him to classical music. Young Francis had a prodigious talent for the piano and developed his repertoire to include pieces by Liszt, Beethoven, Chopin, and Haydn. Yockey claimed that his ideas about race were initially the result of a car accident, wherein he was assaulted by several African Americans. As a result of this attack he lost his front teeth and wore dentures for the rest of his short life.\n\nBefore becoming a devotee of elitist and anti-materialist Oswald Spengler, he briefly flirted with Marxism. Aside from Spengler, he was heavily influenced by the ideas of German legal scholar Carl Schmitt. Like Spengler, he rejected the strict biological view of race, instead preferring a spiritual conception of race married with Karl Haushofer's idea of geopolitics; but unlike Spengler, who disregarded the Nazis for being too bourgeois and anti-Semitic, Yockey believed in German National Socialism, and supported various Fascist and neo-Fascist causes for the remainder of his life, including anti-Semitism.\n\nAs a university student in the late 1930s, Yockey had his first political essay published in \"Social Justice\", a periodical distributed by Fr. Charles Coughlin, known as the \"radio priest,\" At the time Coughlin was widely known for his sympathetic view of the anti-Bolshevist policies associated with Adolf Hitler's Germany, Benito Mussolini's Italy, and Gen. Franco's Spain.\n\nYockey attended at least seven universities. He studied for two years (1934–36) as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, and then transferred to Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. He completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Arizona, and graduated \"cum laude\" from the Notre Dame Law School in 1941.\n\nOver time, Yockey contacted or worked with many of the far-right figures and organizations of his day. These included the German-American Bund, the National German-American Alliance, William Dudley Pelley's Silver Shirts, Sir Oswald Mosley's Union Movement, George Sylvester Viereck, the American H. Keith Thompson, Gerald L. K. Smith, and James H. Madole's National Renaissance Party. After the war Thompson and Madole became advocates of Yockey's worldview and published some of his essays. While Yockey's pro-Fascist activities began in the late 1930s, they did not end there. Unfazed by the defeat of the Axis in the Second World War, Yockey actually became even more active in neo-Fascist causes after 1945. From this point forward, he remained dedicated solely to his cause of reviving Fascism. He dispensed with any semblance of an ordinary life, and remained constantly on the move, travelling to wherever he felt he could pursue his goals most effectively, and cultivating countless contacts along the way.\n\nYockey's ideas were usually embraced only by those, however, who could countenance the necessity of an alliance between the far Left and the far Right, which was a fundamental pillar of Yockey's ideas. The American Nazi Party of George Lincoln Rockwell, for example, rejected Yockey on the basis of his anti-American attitude, as well as his willingness to work with anti-Zionist Communist governments and movements, as the ANP adhered solely to the ideals of absolute anti-Bolshevist National Socialism, as had been advocated by Hitler. (Yockey, however, seems to have remained unaware of Rockwell, as he told Willis Carto that he had never heard of the ANP when Carto visited him in prison in 1960.) Other proponents of Universal Nazism, such as Rockwell's ally Colin Jordan, disagreed with Yockey's views on race, and saw Yockeyism as advocating a kind of \"New Strasserism\" which would undermine true Nazism.\n\nIn early 1946, Yockey began working for the United States War Department as a post-trial review attorney for the Nuremberg Trials in Germany. He soon began agitating against Allied occupation of Germany, as well as what he perceived to be the biased procedures of the Nuremberg tribunal. Eventually, he was fired for \"abandonment of position\" in November 1946.\n\nWithout notes, Yockey wrote his first book, \"Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics\", in Brittas Bay, Ireland over the winter and early spring of 1948. It is a Spenglerian critique of 19th century materialism and rationalism. It is dedicated to 'The hero of the twentieth century'; allegedly, he intended that description to apply to Adolf Hitler. In a rebuttal to the accusations of Arnold Leese, Yockey stated that the \"hero\" of which he spoke was indeed Hitler. The views expressed in \"Imperium\" were endorsed by far-Right thinkers around the world including former German General Otto Remer; Professor of Classics at the University of Illinois, Revilo P. Oliver; and Italian esotericist Julius Evola. Yockey became embittered with Sir Oswald Mosley after the latter refused to publish or review \"Imperium\" upon its completion, after having promised to do so. Guy Chesham, one of the leaders of Mosley's movement, actually resigned from it, in part because of Mosley's treatment of Yockey. \"Imperium\" subscribes to Spengler's suggestion that Germany had been destined to fulfil the 'Roman' role in Western Civilization by uniting all its constituent states into one large empire.\n\nAlong with former Mosleyites Guy Chesham and John Gannon, Yockey formed the European Liberation Front (ELF) in 1948-49. The ELF issued a newsletter, \"Frontfighter\", and published Yockey's virulent anti-American, anti-communist and anti-semitic text \"The Proclamation of London\". In Yockey's view, \"social decay\" was permeated by the Jew, who as a \"Culture-distorter\" and a \"bearer of Culture-disease\", \"instinctively allied himself with all forms, theories, doctrines and practices of decadence in every sphere of life\". \"America is [the Jew and the liberal-communist-democrat]'s programme in process of actualization, and its example shows Europe what the liberal-communist-democratic regime of Culture-distortion is preparing for it during the coming generations\". Yockey was also approached by the group around the anti-Communist Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1951. He was asked to ghost-write a speech for McCarthy which stressed the importance of greater friendship between Germany and the United States, although McCarthy never delivered it as the theme of the speech, when it was announced, aroused a great deal of controversy.\nIn late 1952, Yockey traveled to Prague and witnessed the Prague Trials. He believed they \"foretold a Russian break with Jewry\", a view he put forward in his article \"What is Behind the Hanging of the Eleven Jews in Prague?\". Indeed, that prediction was vindicated by the fact that the last Jewish member of the Soviet Presidium, Lazar Kaganovich, was expelled in 1957 - having been sidelined as early as 1953. (In addition, after sympathizing with Israel in its 1948-49 war, the USSR switched sides and supported Arabs in subsequent conflicts.) Yockey believed that Stalinism had purged Soviet Communism of Jewish influence. He spent the remainder of his life attempting to forge an alliance between the worldwide forces of Communism and the international network of the extreme Right of which he was a part, with an aim toward weakening or overthrowing the government of the United States.\n\nYockey met Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom he called \"a great and vigorous man\", in Cairo in 1953. He worked briefly for the Egyptian Information Ministry, writing anti-Zionist propaganda. Yockey saw the rise of non-aligned states in the Third World, and in particular Arab nationalism, as significant geopolitical challenges to \"the Jewish-American power\". Some speculate that Yockey made clandestine trips during the 1950s into East Germany, and possibly even into the USSR itself, attempting to cultivate Communist ties. It is also known that Yockey visited Cuba shortly after the revolution of Fidel Castro, in the hopes of winning Cuban support for his anti-American alliance. He met with some lower-level officials, but nothing is known to have come of it.\n\nYockey was continuously pursued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for over a decade, which he avoided by adopting numerous aliases. He was finally arrested in 1960 after returning to the United States from abroad, as his suitcase was sent to the wrong airport. When the authorities opened it to determine whose suitcase it was, they discovered several of Yockey's falsified passports and birth certificates. When this was reported to the federal government, the FBI tracked him down in Oakland, California and arrested him. While in prison, he was visited by the American Rightist Willis Carto, who later became the chief advocate and publisher of Yockey's ideas. Yockey was soon after found dead with an empty cyanide capsule nearby while in a jail cell in San Francisco under FBI supervision, leaving a note in which he claimed that he was committing suicide in order to protect the anonymity of his political contacts.\n\nYockey was rather unusual among thinkers of the far-right post-Second World War. \nMost European and American neo-Fascists and other rightists of the post-war period advocated an alliance with the United States as the best hope for the survival of Western culture under the threat of communism, but Yockey felt that an alliance of the right with the left was a far more desirable course. This proposed alliance is referred to as a \"Red-Brown Alliance\" (the color red representing the far-left and the color brown representing the far-right). Yockey felt that American universalism, democracy, and consumer culture, which was by then spreading into western Europe and much of the rest of the world, as well as its alliance with Zionism, was far more corrosive and deadly to the true spirit of the West than was the Soviet Union. Yockey believed that the USSR had become genuinely anti-Zionist under Joseph Stalin, that in its authoritarianism it preserved something of the traditional European concept of hierarchy, and he felt it could more easily be adapted to a rightist orientation over time than was possible in the egalitarian United States. He thus believed that true rightists should aid the spread of communism and Third World anti-colonial movements wherever possible, and he remained staunchly opposed to the government and culture of the United States, which he did not even consider to be truly Western in nature.\n\nYockey himself did not have a very significant influence on the American Right, however, which, throughout the Cold War, for the most part remained staunchly anti-Communist and liberal. He had a much greater impact in Europe, where intellectuals of the Right, especially the current of thought sometimes called the European New Right, including the Belgian Jean Thiriart, the Russian Aleksandr Dugin, and French writers Alain de Benoist and Guillaume Faye, adopted positions similar to Yockey's although there is little evidence his work influenced them in this.\n\nYockey's present influence is reflected mostly through the work of Willis Carto and his Liberty Lobby and successor organizations. Carto ran the \"Youth for George Wallace\" group supporting segregationist George Wallace's 1968 presidential campaign. That group formed the basis for the National Youth Alliance which promoted Yockey's political philosophy and his book \"Imperium\". Many supporters of Yockey, such as H. Keith Thompson, claim that Carto failed to understand Yockey's ideas on their deepest level.\n\n\n\n"}

A great variety of metals have been used for the purpose. Sometimes, as in the case of candlesticks, girandoles have been made in hardwoods. Gilded bronze has been a very frequent medium, but for table use silver is still the favorite material.\n\nGirandoles, or lighting devices, have also been attached to looking glasses and furniture. Some popular mirrors, especially the convex style, and some large dressing glasses of the 19th century were known as \"girandoles\" because of the lighting devices mounted to their sides.\n\nThe word Girandole (pl. \"żyrandol\") is also used in Poland to describe a traditional folk art. Poland’s “Traditional decorative forms included spider girandoles.”,\nwhich are decorative objects hung from the ceiling. Various materials are used to make them, including tissue paper cut, wrapped or manipulated into flowers or garland. “It was probably this enormous variety of form of spider girandoles that caused them to occur practically universally throughout Poland.” “The most recent version of spider girandoles were festoons and garlands of tissue which were stretched starwise at the ceiling.\"\n"}

The event itself inspiring the musical prelude to William Blake's \"\", the piece \"And did those feet in ancient time\" also known as 'Jerusalem' which has become an unofficial anthem of England. The poem asks did Jesus visit England in ancient times, and in so doing created the New Jerusalem, or heaven in England.\n\nAnother first usage of the term by Edward du Bois was in a poem describing the English county of Surrey in 1839. The phrase was also used in its more literal meaning to refer to Heaven, in a poem by Elizabeth Harcourt Rolls Mitchell in 1857.\n\nThe phrase is also used to describe Yorkshire, England's largest county. This is used interchangeably with God's Own County.\n\nThe phrase later found sporadic use to describe several American regions. Most known is the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It was also used by the Confederate army to describe parts of Tennessee in the 1860s. The phrase was also used to describe California in the 1860s, and by Clement Laird Vallandigham to describe the land of the Mississippi plains. None of these remain widely used to describe a region, though it is still occasionally used to describe the United States overall.\n\nDuring World War II, German Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels sarcastically mocked the USA as \"\"Aus Gottes eigenem Land\" (From God's Own Country) in an essay that appeared in the German newspaper Das Reich on August 9, 1942. Goebbels ridiculed America as a young land that lacked culture, education and history in contrast with Germany. In 1943, the Nazis published an anti-American, anti-semitic propaganda book written by \"Erwin Berghaus\" called \"USA - nackt!: Bilddokumente aus Gottes eigenem Land\" (USA naked! Photo documents from God's own country) which also mockingly characterized the USA with the phrase. Several modern German newspapers such as Die Welt, Der Tagesspiegel and Die Zeit have also used the phrase \"Gottes eigenes Land\"\" (God's own country) to criticize American culture and society.\n\nThe earliest recorded use of the phrase as applied to New Zealand was as the title of a poem about New Zealand written by Thomas Bracken. It was published in a book of his poems in 1890, and again in 1893 in a book entitled \"Lays and Lyrics: God's Own Country and Other Poems.\" God's Own Country as a phrase was often used and popularised by New Zealand's longest serving prime minister, Richard John Seddon. He last quoted it on 10 June 1906 when he sent a telegram to the Victorian premier, Thomas Bent, the day before leaving Sydney to return home to New Zealand. \"Just leaving for God's own country,\" he wrote. He never made it, dying the next day on the ship \"Oswestry Grange\". Bracken's \"God's Own Country\" is less well known internationally than \"God Defend New Zealand\" which he published in 1876. The latter poem, set to music by John Joseph Woods, was declared the country's national hymn in 1940, and made the second national anthem of New Zealand along with \"God Save the Queen\" in 1977.\n\nIn Australia, the phrase \"God's own country\" was often used to describe the country in the early 1900s, but it appears to have gradually fallen out of favour. The phrase \"God's Country\" is often used to describe Queensland and the Sutherland Shire in southern Sydney\n\nKerala is a state in south India; the phrase was adopted by the tourism department of the state's government in the 1980s. Kerala is famous for its Ayurvedic treatments, high mountains, gorges and deep-cut valleys, lush and evergreen rain forests, coconut palms, backwaters, and food items. According to Hindu mythology, Kerala was created by Lord Parashurama, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu by throwing his axe across the sea to create new land for his devotees to live peacefully, hence the expression.\n\nThe phrase \"God's own country\" was heard during the 1970s in Rhodesia (formerly: Southern Rhodesia, now: Zimbabwe), where most people perceived the land as beautiful despite the ongoing Bush War of the time. Evidence of the phrase being used earlier in reference to Rhodesia is found in \"Chartered Millions: Rhodesia and the Challenge to the British Commonwealth\" by John Hobbis Harris, published 1920 by Swarthmore Press (refer to page 27). The phrase \"Godzone\" is distinctly different and was not used in Rhodesia.\n"}

{"id": "265635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265635", "title": "Invocation", "text": "Invocation\n\nAn invocation (from the Latin verb \"invocare\" \"to call on, invoke, to give\") may take the form of:\n\nThese forms are described below, but are not mutually exclusive. \nSee also Theurgy.\n\nAs a supplication or prayer it implies to call upon God, a god, goddess, or person, etc. When a person calls upon God, a god, or goddess to ask for something (protection, a favour, his/her spiritual presence in a ceremony, etc.) or simply for worship, this can be done in a pre-established form or with the invoker's own words or actions. An example of a pre-established text for an invocation is the Lord's Prayer.\n\nAll religions in general use invoking prayers, liturgies, or hymns; see for example the mantras in Hinduism and Buddhism, the Egyptian \"Coming Out by Day\" (aka \"Book of the Dead\"), the Orphic Hymns and the many texts, still preserved, written in cuneiform characters on clay tablets, addressed to Shamash, Ishtar, and other deities.\n\nAn invocation can also be a secular alternative to a prayer. On August 30, 2012, Dan Nerren, a member of the Humanist Association of Tulsa, delivered a secular invocation to open a meeting of the City Council of Tulsa. Nerren was invited to perform the invocation as a compromise following a long-running dispute with the City Council over prayers opening meetings. The invocation was written by Andrew Lovley, a member of the Southern Maine Association of Secular Humanists who had previously used the invocation in 2009 to invoke an inauguration ceremony for new city officials in South Portland, Maine.\n\nIn this usage, it is comparable to an affirmation as an alternative for those who conscientiously object to taking oaths of any kind, be it for reasons of belief or non-belief.\n\nThe word \"possession\" is used here in its neutral form to mean \"a state (sometimes psychological) in which an individual's normal personality is replaced by another\". This is also sometimes known as 'aspecting'. This can be done as a means of communicating with or getting closer to a deity or spirit, and as such need not be viewed synonymously with demonic possession.\n\nIn some religious traditions including Paganism, Shamanism and Wicca, \"invocation\" means to draw a spirit or Spirit force into one's own body and is differentiated from \"evocation\", which involves asking a spirit or force to become present at a given location. Again, Aleister Crowley states that\nTo \"invoke\" is to \"call in\", just as to \"evoke\" is to \"call forth\". This is the essential difference between the two branches of Magick. In invocation, the macrocosm floods the consciousness. In evocation, the magician, having become the macrocosm, creates a microcosm.\nPossessive invocation may be attempted singly or, as is often the case in Wicca, in pairs - with one person doing the invocation (reciting the liturgy or prayers and acting as anchor), and the other person being invoked (allowing themselves to become a vessel for the spirit or deity). The person successfully invoked may be moved to speak or act in non-characteristic ways, acting as the deity or spirit; and they may lose all or some self-awareness while doing so. A communication might also be given via imagery (a religious vision). They may also be led to recite a text in the manner of that deity, in which case the invocation is more akin to ritual drama. The Wiccan Charge of the Goddess is an example of such a pre-established recitation. See also the ritual of Drawing Down the Moon.\n\nThe ecstatic, possessory form of invocation may be compared to loa possession in the Vodou tradition where devotees are described as being \"ridden\" or \"mounted\" by the deity or spirit. In 1995 National Geographic journalist Carol Beckwith described events she had witnessed during Vodoun possessions:\nA woman splashed sand into her eyes, a man cut his belly with shards of glass but did not bleed, another swallowed fire. Nearby a believer, perhaps a yam farmer or fisherman, heated hand-wrought knives in crackling flames. Then another man brought one of the knives to his tongue. We cringed at the sight and were dumbfounded when, after several repetitions, his tongue had not even reddened.\n\nPossessive invocation has also been described in certain Norse rites where Odin is invoked to \"ride\" workers of seidr (Norse shamanism), much like the god rides his eight-legged horse Sleipnir. Indeed, forms of possessive invocation appear throughout the world in most mystical or ecstatic traditions, wherever devotees seek to touch upon the essence of a deity or spirit.\n\nSome have performed invocation for the purpose of controlling or extracting favors from certain spirits or deities. These invocations usually involve a commandment or threat against the entity invoked.\n\nThe following is a curious example of such an invocation, found engraved in cuneiform on a statue of the Assyrian demon Pazuzu. Although it seems to constitute an identification with the demon, it was actually considered a protective amulet with the power to command this entity not to harm people or their possessions.\nI am Pazuzu, son of the king of the evil spirits, that one who descends impetuously from the mountains and bring the storms. That is the one I am.\nAnother example is found in the book Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches during the Conjuration of Diana, where the goddess is evoked into a piece of bread and threatened to grant a wish:\n\n<poem>\nI do not bake the bread, nor with it salt,\nNor do I cook the honey with the wine,\nI bake the body and the blood and soul,\nThe soul of (great) Diana, that she shall\nKnow neither rest nor peace, and ever be\nIn cruel suffering till she will grant\nWhat I request, what I do most desire,\nI beg it of her from my very heart!\nAnd if the grace be granted, O Diana!\nIn honour of thee I will hold this feast,\nFeast and drain the goblet deep,\nWe will dance and wildly leap,\nAnd if thou grant'st the grace which I require,\nThen when the dance is wildest, all the lamps\nShall be extinguished and we'll freely love!\n</poem>\n\nInvocation can refer to taking on the qualities of the being invoked, such as the allure of Aphrodite or the ferocity of Kali. In this instance the being is literally called up from within oneself (as an archetype) or into oneself (as an external force), depending on the personal belief system of the invoker. The main difference between this type of invocation and the possessive category described above is that the former may appear more controlled, with self-identification and deity-identification mixed together. In practice, invocations may blend many or all of these categories. See for example this Hymn to Astarte from the Songs of Bilitis, first attributed to a contemporary of Sappho (but actually written by Pierre Louÿs in the 1890s):\nMother inexhaustible and incorruptible, creatures, born the first, engendered by thyself and by thyself conceived, issue of thyself alone and seeking joy within thyself, Astarte! \nOh! Perpetually fertilized, virgin and nurse of all that is, chaste and lascivious, pure and revelling, ineffable, nocturnal, sweet, breather of fire, foam of the sea! \nThou who accordest grace in secret, thou who unitest, thou who lovest, thou who seizest with furious desire the multiplied races of savage beasts and couplest the sexes in the wood. \nOh, irresistible Astarte! hear me, take me, possess me, oh, Moon! and thirteen times each year draw from my womb the sweet libation of my blood!\n\n"}

{"id": "2008865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008865", "title": "Mateship", "text": "Mateship\n\nMateship is an Australian cultural idiom that embodies equality, loyalty and friendship, usually among men. Russel Ward, in \"The Australian Legend\" (1958), saw the concept as a central one to the Australian people. \"Mateship\" derives from \"mate\", meaning \"friend\", commonly used in Australia as an amicable form of address.\n\nMateship is regarded as an Australian military virtue. For instance, the Australian Army Recruit Training Centre lists the \"soldierly qualities\" it seeks to instill as including \"a will to win, dedication to duty, honour, compassion and honesty, mateship and teamwork, loyalty, and physical and moral courage.\"\n\nThe word \"mate\" bloomed during World War I, when lots of trenches were being built because of the machine gun. Many trenches were built which often stretched miles across war grounds. The words “diggers” and “mate” gained the same meaning and became interchangeable.\n\nDuring the 1999 Australian constitutional referendum there was some consideration regarding the inclusion of the term \"mateship\" in the preamble of the Australian constitution. This proposed change was drafted by the Australian poet Les Murray, in consultation with the Prime Minister of the time, John Howard:\n\nAustralians are free to be proud of their country and heritage, free to realise themselves as individuals, and free to pursue their hopes and ideals. We value excellence as well as fairness, independence as dearly as mateship.\n\nMurray was not supportive of the inclusion of \"mateship\" in the preamble, stating that it was \"blokeish\" and \"not a real word\", but the Prime Minister insisted it be included as the term, he said, had \"a hallowed place in the Australian lexicon\". Howard reluctantly dropped the term from the preamble, after the Australian Democrats refused to allow it to be passed by the Senate where they held the balance of power.\n\nSince the referendum the Australian government has introduced the concept of mateship as a possible part of an Australian citizenship test, although it was unclear how endorsement of the values of mateship would be tested.\n\nMateship is a concept that can be traced back to early colonial times. The harsh environment in which convicts and new settlers found themselves meant that men and women closely relied on each other for all sorts of help. In Australia, a 'mate' is more than just a friend and is a term that implies a sense of shared experience, mutual respect and unconditional assistance.\n\nThe term includes use in ways other than friendship like getting someone's attention, replacing a name, questioning a statement, letting one know to calm down and referring to someone in a rash or harsh way. The use of such in a harsh or negative way can be traced back to the word \"bastard\". Around the 16th century, the word \"mate\" adopted a similar meaning. Only within the last two centuries, has the term connected itself with a meaning of friendship.\n\n\n\n"}

In German: \"Mittelniederdeutsch\") is a developmental stage of Low German. It developed from the Old Saxon language in the Middle Ages and has been documented in writing since about 1225/34 (\"Sachsenspiegel\"). The Middle Low German language was in the Hanseatic period from about 1300 to about 1600 the leading written language in the north of Central Europe and served as a lingua franca in the northern half of Europe. It was used parallel to medieval Latin also for purposes of diplomacy and for deeds.\n\n\"Middle Low German\" is a term used with varying degrees of inclusivity. It is distinguished from Middle High German, spoken to the south, which was later replaced by Early New High German. It is sometimes taken to mean the dialect continuum of all the other high medieval Continental West Germanic dialects, from Flanders in the West to the eastern Baltic, but it is sometimes seen as separate from western varieties such as Middle Dutch.\n\nMiddle Low German provided a large number of loanwords to languages spoken around the Baltic Sea as a result of the activities of Hanseatic traders. It is considered the largest single source of loanwords in Danish, Estonian, Latvian, Norwegian and Swedish.\n\nSub-periods of Middle Low German are:\n\n\nMiddle Low German was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League, spoken all around the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. It used to be thought that the language of Lübeck was dominant enough to become a normative standard (the so-called ) for an emergent spoken and written standard, but more recent work has established that there is no evidence for this and that Middle Low German was non-standardised.\n\nTraces of the importance of Middle Low German can be seen by the many loanwords found in the Scandinavian, Finnic, and Baltic languages, as well as standard German and English.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, Middle Low German lost its prestige to Early New High German, which was first used by elites as a written and, later, a spoken language. Reasons for this loss of prestige include the decline of the Hanseatic League, followed by political heteronomy of Northern Germany and the cultural predominance of Middle and Southern Germany during the Protestant Reformation and Luther's German translation of the Bible.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42332846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42332846", "title": "Moonlight clan", "text": "Moonlight clan\n\nMoonlight Clan, or \"Yue Guang Zu\" () is a Chinese term used to describe a large group of people who expend their entire salary before the end of each month, especially young people.\nThe term is derived from a lunar cycle. While \"yue guang\" translates directly to \"moonlight\", it is also a pun derived from the combination of its individual words, \"yue\" (月; month or moon) and \"guang\" (光; empty, used up, or light). \"Zu\" (clan, race) refers to a group of people who shares this characteristic. In the United States, a comparable notion is referred to as \"living paycheck to paycheck\".\n\nThis group of people can not only meet the basic needs but can also pursue a higher standard of living. Members of this group include white collar workers and the middle class.\n\nMembers of the Moonlight Clan who earn a relatively high income tend towards economic materialism. Most of them lack financial discipline (i.e. overspending) and fail to plan for the future.\n\nPeople earning a relatively high income are usually brand-loyal consumers who pursue pleasure-seeking and luxurious lifestyles. They tend to have strong consumption confidence.\n\nThis group of people struggle to meet basic needs, thus having a lower standard of living in comparison to Type 1. This group is mainly constituted by low socio-economic groups including people who are paid low hourly wages minimum wage, such as blue-collar workers.\n\nLower-income consumers spend mostly on necessities and rent as they are burdened by the rising cost of living. They do not have extra money for expensive pleasure-seeking activities and luxurious goods.\n\nWith reference to the 2011 Population Census in Thematic Report: Youth, the median income monthly of teenagers aged from fifteen to twenty-four remained at HKD $8,000 unchanged for 10 years since 2001. The median monthly income of the whole population had increased to HKD$9,000 over the past ten years. The Consumer Price Index of Hong Kong increased by thirteen percent, from 96 to 109 index points, during 2001 and 2011. The lower income group could hardly afford the progression of standard of living of the society. As a result, the high cost of living leads to an increase in the number of Moonlight Clan members.\n\nLacking knowledge in money management, personal budgeting and saving, people seldom track their spending habits and savings to review their expenses. According to a survey conducted by the University of Hong Kong, less than one third of the respondents would save their income before spending, or even spend more than what they are earning in a month.\n\nBeing bombarded by commercial advertisements, people with relatively high incomes feel compelled to pursue personal wellbeing and happiness through material possessions. An easy access to a variety of entertainment and activities may be the reason for the increase in consumerism for Moonlight Clan as they tend to spend and enjoy the present instead of saving for the future.\n\nBy using credit cards, people can spend money they have not earned. In recent years, the credit card industry has been burgeoning, making credit cards available for almost everyone with insufficient screening. In Hong Kong, the credit card rates are rising and the debt they are carrying is 30% or above for annualized interest.\n\nFurthermore, online buying is becoming more and more popular. People can frequent online shopping and auction sites like Amazon.com, Taobao.com, eBay.com, and make online payments via acquirers like Paypal. This may affect their financial discipline and foster overspending behavior, becoming one of the underlying causes of compulsive or obsessive consumerism.\n\nIn 2012, MassMutual Asia Ltd commissioned the Public Opinion Programme of the University of Hong Kong to conduct a telephone survey about post-80s and post-90s. The survey findings revealed that one out of seven respondents represented the Moonlight Clan, as they spent as much as they earned monthly, or even spent more than they earned.\n\nA survey in 2011 on Guangzhou youth aged fifteen to thirty-five revealed that thirty-five percent of interviewees were part of the Moonlight Clan. Their average expenditure is two-third of the average income. Moreover, there are approximately three hundred million people earning less than $2 a day. These people constitute the main part of the moonlight clan of the low income group.\n\n"}

(stylized as mother!) is a 2017 American psychological horror film written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, and starring Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris, and Michelle Pfeiffer. The plot follows a young woman whose tranquil life with her husband at their country home is disrupted by the arrival of a mysterious couple.\n\n\"Mother!\" was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 74th Venice International Film Festival, and premiered there on September 5, 2017. It was released in the United States on September 15, 2017, by Paramount Pictures, and grossed $44 million worldwide against its $30 million budget. Although the film received generally positive reviews from critics, its biblical allegories and depiction of violence sparked controversy.\n\nIn the burnt-out remains of a large house, Him, an acclaimed poet struggling with writer's block, places a crystal object on a pedestal in his study. The ruined house morphs into a lovely home in an edenic landscape. In bed, Mother, the poet's wife and muse, awakens and wonders aloud where Him is. While renovating the house, she starts seeing things that unsettle her, including visualizing a beating heart within its walls.\n\nOne day, Man turns up at the house, asking for a room. Him readily agrees, and Mother reluctantly follows suit. During his stay, Man suffers coughing fits and Mother observes an open wound in his side. Soon Man's wife, Woman, also arrives to stay. Mother is increasingly frustrated with her guests, but Him begs her to let them stay, telling Mother they are fans of his work and Man is dying. However, when Man and Woman accidentally shatter the crystal object, which Him had forbidden them to touch, Mother kicks them out and Him boards up his study.\n\nBefore Man and Woman can leave, their two sons arrive and fight over their father's will. The Oldest Son, who will be left with nothing, severely wounds his Younger Brother and flees. Him, Man, and Woman take the injured son for help. Alone in the house, Mother follows a trail of blood to find a tank of heating oil hidden behind the basement walls.\n\nUpon returning, Him informs Mother the son has died. Dozens of people arrive at the house to honor the dead son. They behave in rude and presumptuous ways that irritate Mother; she snaps when they break a sink, flooding the house. She orders everyone out and berates Him for allowing so many people inside while ignoring her needs. Their argument ends in passionate lovemaking.\n\nThe next morning, Mother announces she is pregnant. The news elates Him and inspires him to finish his work. Mother prepares for the arrival of their child and reads Him's beautiful new poem. Upon publication, it immediately sells out every copy. In celebration, Mother prepares a big dinner, but a group of fans arrives at the house before they can eat. She asks Him to send them away, but he insists he has to be polite and will return soon. Mother tries to lock the doors, but more fans arrive and enter the house to use the toilet. They start stealing things as souvenirs and damaging the house, but Him is oblivious due to the adulation he is receiving. Hundreds of people fill the house and an increasingly disoriented Mother watches it devolve into chaos. Military forces battle a cult of frenzied fans who tear rooms apart and engage in religious rituals. Amidst gunfire and explosions, the Herald, the poet's publicist, organizes mass executions.\n\nMother goes into labor and finds Him. He takes her to his study, which he reopens so she can give birth there. The havoc outside subsides. Him tells Mother his fans want to see their newborn son; she refuses and holds her son tightly. When she falls asleep, however, Him takes their child outside to the crowd, which passes the baby around wildly until his neck is inadvertently snapped. Mother wades into the crowd where she sees people eating her son's mutilated corpse. Furious, she calls them murderers and stabs them with a shard of glass. They turn on her, viciously beating and attempting to strangle her until Him intervenes. He implores Mother to forgive them, but she escapes, makes her way to the basement oil tank, and punctures it with a pipe wrench. Despite her husband's pleas, she sets the oil alight; it explodes, destroying the crowd, the house, and the surrounding environment.\n\nMother and Him survive; she is horrifically burned while Him is completely unscathed. He asks for her love and she agrees. He tears open her chest and removes her heart. As he crushes the heart with his hands, a new crystal object is revealed. He places it on its pedestal and, once again, the house is transformed from a burnt-out shell into a beautiful home. In bed, a new Mother appears and wakes up, wondering aloud where Him is.\n\nIn an interview, Lawrence said that the film is an allegory; she said that the film \"depicts the rape and torment of Mother Earth ... I represent Mother Earth; Javier, whose character is a poet, represents a form of God, a creator; Michelle Pfeiffer is an Eve to Ed Harris's Adam, there's Cain and Abel and the setting sometimes resembles the Garden of Eden\".\n\nAronofsky said that the exclamation mark in the title \"reflects the spirit of the film\" and corresponds to an \"exclamation point\" of the ending. The director discussed the film's unusual capitalisation in a Reddit interview, saying, \"To find out why there's a lowercase 'm', read the credits and look for the letter that isn't capitalised. Ask yourself what's another name for this character?\" The characters' names are all shown in lowercase, except for Him.\n\nThe lighter which appears throughout the film bears the Wendehorn, a symbol believed to represent \"the cooperation between nature's eternal laws, working in effect and in accordance with each other.\" One of the film's unexplained elements is the yellow powder Lawrence's character drinks, which \"The Daily Beast\" suggests is a reference to Charlotte Perkins Gilman's short story \"The Yellow Wallpaper\".\n\nAfter 2014's \"Noah\", Aronofsky began working on a children's film. During that process, he came up with a new idea. He ended up writing the \"Mother!\" screenplay in five days, much faster than his usual pace. The film uses a dream-logic narrative, of which Aronofsky has noted, \"if you try to unscrew it, it kind of falls apart,\" and that \"it's a psychological freak-out. You shouldn't over-explain it.\"\n\nJennifer Lawrence was reportedly in talks to join the film by October 2015. By January 2016, Javier Bardem was also in talks to star, and by April Domhnall Gleeson, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ed Harris, and Brian Gleeson were added to the cast. In March 2016, it was announced Kristen Wiig had been cast in the film.\n\nShooting for the film began on June 13, 2016, and concluded on August 28, 2016. Prior to the start of principal photography, the cast rehearsed for three months in a warehouse, during which time Aronofsky was able to \"get a sense of movement and camera movement, and learn from that.\" During this time, Lawrence was relatively laid-back, and Aronofsky has said that as a result he \"didn't get to know the character until we started shooting, and she showed up.\"\n\n\"Mother!\" is the first Aronofsky film without composer Clint Mansell's involvement. The film originally had a score composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson, but after seeing the 90-minute score synced up with a rough cut of the film, Aronofsky and Jóhannsson agreed not to use the original score. They experimented with using the score at only a few moments, or instead using a new minimal score focused on sound design that incorporated noises into the soundscape of the house. Ultimately, they went with the second choice, and Jóhannsson's work merged with the sound design of Craig Henighan. Composer Ólafur Arnalds recounted the following story about the decision:\n\nOver its closing credits, the film features an a cappella Patti Smith cover of Skeeter Davis's \"The End of the World\".\n\nThe film was originally scheduled to be released on October 13, 2017, but was moved to September 15.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the 74th Venice International Film Festival, where it was selected to compete for the Golden Lion. The film premiered in London on 6 September 2017. It also screened at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nOn August 7, 2017, the first official trailer for the film was released.\n\n\"Mother!\" was released digitally on December 5, 2017, and was released on Blu-ray and DVD on December 19.\n\n\"Mother!\" grossed $17.8 million in the United States and Canada and $26.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $44.5 million, against a production budget of $30 million.\n\nIn North America, the film was released alongside \"American Assassin\" and was projected to gross $12–14 million from 2,368 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $700,000 from Thursday night previews and $3.1 million on its first day. It went on to open to just $7.5 million, finishing third at the box office and marking the worst debut for Lawrence in a film where she had top billing. Deadline Hollywood attributed the film's underperformance to its controversial narrative, misleading advertisements, and \"F\" CinemaScore grade. Other publications wrote that the film's CinemaScore grade, which is extremely rare, is associated with \"a movie that goes out of its way to artfully alienate or confuse audiences.\" In its second weekend, the film dropped 56.3% to $3.3 million, finishing sixth at the box office.\n\nAronofsky responded to the film's CinemaScore rating by saying that it was meant to be difficult viewing for audiences: \"How if you walk out of this movie are you not going to give it an 'F'? … We wanted to make a punk movie and come at you. And the reason I wanted to come is because I was very sad and I had a lot of anguish and I wanted to express it.\"\n\n\"Mother!\" received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Aronofsky's direction and the performances, particularly of Lawrence and Pfeiffer. The film received both boos and a standing ovation during its premiere at the Venice Film Festival. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 69%, based on 319 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"There's no denying that \"Mother!\" is the thought-provoking product of a singularly ambitious artistic vision, though it may be too unwieldy for mainstream tastes.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on reviews from 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"F\" on an A+ to F scale, making it one of fewer than twenty films to receive the score, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave a 51% overall positive and a 33% \"definite recommend\".\n\nOwen Gleiberman of \"Variety\", in his positive review of the film, wrote: \"By all means, go to 'Mother!' and enjoy its roller-coaster-of-weird exhibitionism. But be afraid, very afraid, only if you're hoping to see a movie that's as honestly disquieting as it is showy.\" Gleiberman labelled \"Mother!\" as \"a piece of ersatz humanity\". Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, describing the film and Aronofsky's direction as an \"artist's cry from his own corrupt heart\" and \"a work of a visionary\". He also praised the film's allegorical narrative and the performances of Lawrence, Bardem, and Pfeiffer, and said, positively, that the cinematography \"always seems on the verge of exploding\". Writing for the \"Chicago Tribune\", Michael Phillips said \"Darren Aronofsky delivers a damning critique of the artist/muse arrangement, even as he admits to its old-fashioned patriarchal simplicity.\" He also referred to the film and its script as \"grandiose and narcissistic and, in quick strokes, pretty vicious,\" while drawing a similarity to Aronofsky's film, \"Black Swan\".\n\nWriting for \"The Guardian\", Peter Bradshaw gave the film 5 stars, saying, \"Darren Aronofsky’s toweringly outrageous film leaves no gob unsmacked. It is an event-movie detonation, a phantasmagorical horror and black-comic nightmare that jams the narcosis needle right into your abdomen.\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the film a B+, writing, \"the filmmaking ranks as some of Aronofsky's most skillful\". Ben Croll of \"IndieWire\" gave the film an A−, noting \"Awash in both religious and contemporary political imagery, Darren Aronofsky's allusive film opens itself to a number of allegorical readings, but it also works as a straight-ahead head rush.\" In an essay for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Martin Scorsese said, \"It was so tactile, so beautifully staged and acted — the subjective camera and the POV reverse angles, always in motion … the sound design, which comes at the viewer from around corners and leads you deeper and deeper into the nightmare … the unfolding of the story, which very gradually becomes more and more upsetting as the film goes forward. The horror, the dark comedy, the biblical elements, the cautionary fable — they're all there, but they're elements in the total experience, which engulfs the characters and the viewers along with them. Only a true, passionate filmmaker could have made this picture, which I'm still experiencing weeks after I saw it.\"\n\nRex Reed gave the film zero stars in \"The New York Observer\", and wrote that despite some good cinematography, \"Nothing about \"Mother!\" makes one lick of sense as Darren Aronofsky's corny vision of madness turns more hilarious than scary. With so much crap around to clog the drain, I hesitate to label it the 'Worst movie of the year' when 'Worst movie of the century' fits it even better.\" Reed further dismissed other critics' positive reviews of the film as \"equally pretentious\" and \"even nuttier than the film itself. ... they all insist \"Mother!\" is a metaphor for something, although they are not quite sure what it is.\" Similarly, \"The New Republic\"’s Josephine Livingstone states that the film has \"no human center to hold it down.\" Anthony Lane in his \"New Yorker\" review wrote, \"My patience was tested beyond repair, I am afraid, by the nimbus of nonsense.\" In his \"Wall Street Journal\" review, John Anderson said, \"it achieves a level of excess that makes the whole enterprise increasingly cartoonish, rather than just awful.\" \"Chicago Sun-Times\" Richard Roeper rated the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing that while he appreciated Lawrence's performance, he questioned whether Aronofsky was mocking certain biblical passages featured in the film or presenting a commentary on an artistic process. Writing for \"The Washington Post\", Anne Hornaday gave the film 2 stars, saying, \"Even Lawrence's magnetic powers can't keep \"Mother!\" from going off the rails, which at first occurs cumulatively, then in a mad rush during the film's outlandish climax.\"\n\nStephen Whitty of the \"Newark Star Ledger\" wrote, \"one part early Roman Polanski, one part pseudo Harold Pinter, and two parts apology-from-a-driven-artist. And none of it adds up. The feeble idea behind \"Mother!\" isn't strong enough to bear the weight of all the overwrought style he hangs on it. Unlike the mansion it's set in, it's a small, hammered-together thing, and it can't bear all this meaning and metaphor.\" Chris Nashawaty of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said \"Darren Aronofsky’s Mother! is Rosemary’s Baby amped up into a fugue state of self-indulgent solipsism. He’s an artist. And he really wants you to know that he’s been thinking a lot about what that means. Unfortunately, his gaze is so deep into his own navel that it’s just exasperating.\" David Edelstein of \"New York\" magazine shrugged off the film and any talk of its craft, writing, \"Most of the dialogue and effects are clunky, repetitive, second rate.\"\n\nThe film's nominations at the 38th Golden Raspberry Awards received backlash from audiences and critics, especially Lawrence's nomination, whose performance was praised by critics.\n\n"}

This is similar to Arabic, Icelandic, and Somali naming conventions. Traditionally for the Abyssinian people, the lineage is traced paternally; legislation has been passed in Eritrea that allows for this to be done on the maternal side as well.\n\nIn this convention, children are given a name at birth, by which name they will be known. To differentiate from others in the same generation with the same name, their father's first name and sometimes grandfather's first name is added. This may continue \"ad infinitum\". Outside Ethiopia, this is often mistaken for a surname, but unlike European names, different generations do not have the same second or third names.\n\nIn marriage, unlike in some Western countries, women do not change their name, as the second name is not a surname.\n\nIn the example above, the progenitors, \"Feiven\" and \"Senai\", may be differentiated from others in their generation by their father's name. In this example, Feiven's and Senai's fathers' first names are \"Tewolde\" and \"Abraham\" respectively.\n\nFeiven and Senai have a daughter and a son, each of whom is married and has a child. The first to have a child (a son) is their daughter, Yordanos Senai; she and her husband name the boy \"Ammanuel\". The next sibling to have a child is Yordanos' brother, Zerezghi Senai; this child is also a son. As it is against custom to name a child after a living family member, his parents give him a different first name than his cousin: \"Afwerki\". \nAmmanuel and Afwerki would each get their father's first name for their last.\n\nIn the diaspora, this method is sometimes dropped in favor of adopting the grandfather's name (the father's \"last name\") as a surname in accordance with Western naming conventions. In contemporary Eritrea (post-Independence from Ethiopia), a person's legal name consists of their given name, followed by the given name of a parent and the given name of a parent of that parent. Meanwhile in modern Ethiopia, a person's legal name includes both the father's and grandfather's names (the father's full name), so that the father's name becomes the child's \"middle name.\" \n\n"}

The focal point of the emblem is the fire symbol, and this comes from the fact that Azerbaijan has many everlasting fires which also gives the name \"land of eternal fire\" – in representation of its original roots in Zoroastrianism.\n\nAt the bottom of the emblem is a stalk of wheat, representing the main agricultural product of the nation, which was also part of the earlier arms. The other plant represented at the bottom is oak.\n\nThe government of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic declared a competition on the national emblem of Azerbaijan on 30 January 1920 and made a decision to present the emblem model on May of the same year. However, due to the collapse of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic on 28 April 1920, the emblem was not approved.\n\nThe Supreme Medjlis of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic discussed the issue connected with the national emblem and raised petition in the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR on declaration of a new competition on the national emblem of Azerbaijan on 17 November 1990.\n\nThe competition was declared by the decision of the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan Republic on 5 February 1991. Tens of projects of the emblem were presented during the competition of 1991–1992 and it was also proposed to approve one of the projects developed between 1919–1920.\n\nBy the Constitutional Law of the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan Republic, approved on 19 January 1993, one of the projects, developed between 1919–1920 with certain alterations was confirmed the national emblem of Azerbaijan.\n\nLike other post-Soviet republics whose symbols do not predate the October Revolution, the current emblem retained partial components of the Soviet one such as the wheat and the color red on the shield previously seen in the banners.\n\nThe colours used in composing the emblem are taken from the national flag. The green represents Islam; red represents the development and democracy of Azerbaijan; and blue represents that the Azerbaijanis are a Turkic people. The eight-pointed star (octagram) itself stands for the eight branches of the Turkic peoples, and between each point of the star, there is a smaller yellow circle found.\n\nThe National Emblem symbolizes the independence of Azerbaijan. It is the image of an oriental shield and a semicircle formed by the branches of an oak-tree and ears resting on it. The shield contains the image of a fire that resemble the \"land of fire\" – in the center of an eight-point star against a background of the colors of the National flag.\n\nThe Azerbaijani emblem is shown on:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23065843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23065843", "title": "New Super Mario Bros. Wii", "text": "New Super Mario Bros. Wii\n\nThe game's plot is similar to other side-scrolling \"Super Mario\" games. The player controls Mario as he travels eight worlds and fights Bowser's henchmen to rescue Princess Peach. \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" is the first \"Super Mario\" game to feature simultaneous multiplayer gameplay; up to four people can play in cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes, taking control of Mario as well as Luigi and one of two multicolored Toads. The game also introduces \"Super Guide\", which allows the player to watch a computer-controlled character complete a level.\n\nShigeru Miyamoto had held desires to create a \"Super Mario\" game with cooperative multiplayer since the series' synthesis. After failed attempts to integrate it into \"Super Mario 64\" due to hardware limitations, he was able to fully explore the concept with the advent of the Wii and its more advanced hardware capabilities. Having developed \"New Super Mario Bros.\" and feeling that it was not as challenging as he hoped, Miyamoto designed \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" with the intent of accessibility for players of all skill levels. Features such as Super Guide and the ability to enter a floating bubble on command and opt out of doing a certain part of a level was added to cater to beginners, whereas other details, such as an award for not prompting the Super Guide block to appear in any level, were added to provide a layer of difficulty. Shiho Fujii and Ryo Nagamatsu composed the game's soundtrack, whereas Koji Kondo, the series' regular composer, served as sound advisor.\n\nThe game was announced following a slight drop in profits, with Nintendo hoping that its release would help to rejuvenate sales of the Wii console. \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" was both critically and commercially successful, receiving particular praise for its multiplayer aspect, though some critics were disappointed by the game's lack of new content compared to previous \"Super Mario\" titles. As of March 2018, it is the fourth best-selling game on the Wii, selling 30.20 million copies worldwide. It received several honors, including the Best Wii Game award from the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, IGN, and GameTrailers. A sequel, \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", was developed for the Wii U console and released as a launch game for the system in November 2012.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" is a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer; although it plays out in 2D, most of the in-game characters and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds. In single-player mode, the player controls Mario and must complete levels, which are filled with both helpful items and harmful obstacles, by manoeuvering him to the large flag pole at the end of the stage. The game can be played with the Wii Remote held horizontally, or with the Remote and the Wii Nunchuk. Mario can run, jump, and perform additional moves returning from \"New Super Mario Bros.\" such as wall kicks, ground pounds and double and triple jumps. New to \"Wii\" are several abilities making use of the Wii Remote's motion control features; the player can shake the controller in order to perform various different actions, such as a short spin jump which kills enemies, a mid-air twirl that can be used to sustain air time, and the ability to pick up, carry and throw certain objects. Certain areas within levels, such as specific platforms, can be manipulated by standing over them and tilting the Wii Remote. Certain levels are set underwater, where the player must swim to traverse the level.\n\nIn addition to gold coins, which the player can collect to earn extra lives, levels contain power-ups encased in floating blocks which aid Mario in his quest. For instance, the Super Mushroom makes Mario increase in size and allows him to absorb more damage; the Fire Flower lets Mario shoot fireballs at enemies; and the Super Star gives the player temporary invincibility and increases running speed. The Mini Mushroom, which reappears from \"New Super Mario Bros.\", causes Mario to shrink in size, letting him jump higher, run on water and fit through small spaces, albeit while making him vulnerable to enemies and other obstacles. New power-ups include the Propeller Suit, which allows Mario to fly for a short time by shaking the Wii Remote. Both the Ice Flower and the Penguin Suit give Mario the ability to shoot balls of ice which freeze enemies into large ice blocks that can be lifted and thrown, whilst the Penguin Suit additionally allows the player to slide along the ground and across water as well as giving them tighter control on ice and in water. Yoshi appears in certain levels and is able to eat, swallow and spit enemies and objects, and flutter for a period of time.\n\nThe game consists eight worlds, with a secret ninth world accessible by locating all of the hidden Star Coins, which serve as the primary collectible in each stage. Levels are accessed via a 3D world map; completing a stage unlocks the next one, with multiple paths sometimes available after completing a stage. Each world contains two boss levels — a midway fortress and a castle at the end of the world — where the player battles one of the seven Koopalings.<ref name=\"man7/8\">\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii 'Here We Go'\" Instruction Booklet, p.7-8</ref> In addition to levels, there are also \"Toad Houses\" located across the map in which the player can play a short minigame to earn extra lives or items that can be equipped from the map screen. Map screens often have enemies roaming them in certain dedicated areas which, when encountered, initiate a \"mini-boss\" fight that awards the player with power-ups after being won. At certain points, a Toad will appear trapped in one of the previously completed levels, and the player can choose to rescue him from a block and carry him safely to the end of the stage in order to earn additional lives.<ref name=\"man21/22\">\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii 'Here We Go'\" Instruction Booklet, p.21-22</ref> Every course contains three Star Coins which are hidden in hard-to-reach areas. These can be spent on hint movies which show off tips and tricks for the game, including the locations of secrets and methods for getting infinite lives.\n\nThe player begins the game with five lives, but more can be obtained through a plethora of ways including collecting items. and playing minigames. Losing a life will return the player to the map, and losing all lives results in a game over, forcing the player to return from their last save point. Most levels contain a midway flag which acts as a save point. Certain levels contain hidden alternative exits leading to a flag pole with a red flag. Reaching this goal opens up a path on the map that leads to a hidden area.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" features \"Super Guide\", a concept meant to help players that are having difficulty completing a certain level, and the first Nintendo game to include the concept. During single-player mode, if a player dies eight times in a row in any level, a green \"!\" Block appears, which can be hit to allow a computer-controlled Luigi to show the player a safe path through the level without revealing any Star Coin locations or secret exits. The player may interrupt the guide at any time and take control of Luigi from that point. After Luigi completes the course, the player has the option to try the level again, or skip it completely.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" is the first \"Super Mario\" game to feature simultaneous cooperative multiplayer gameplay. Up to four players, as either Mario, his brother Luigi, or one of two different colored Toads, can play through levels together. Stages are completed when one player touches the flag pole; other players have a limited amount of time to grab it in pursuit before they automatically enter a bubble and the stage is completed. A bonus is awarded if all players grab hold of the flag within three seconds of the first player grabbing it. Players are ranked after each level based on points, coins, and enemy kills they achieve.\n\nPlayers are able to interact with each other in several ways, which can be used to either help or compete with each other; for instance, players can jump on each other's heads in order to reach higher places. They can also pick up and throw each other, and eat and spit each other out while riding Yoshi. If a large distance forms between two or more characters, the game's camera will compensate by panning out to show all of them at once. If the players still do not catch up, they are then dragged by the edge of the screen until they move forward faster or lose a life via a passing obstacle. If one player enters a different area of a level, such as one enclosed via a warp pipe or a door, without the other players, they will warp to the same place after a short period of time.\n\nThe first player, who controls Mario, navigates the world map and selects stages. Players return to the map screen if they all die before anybody respawns in the stage. If all players run out of lives and get a game over, they must restart from their last save point. If a player dies, they re-emerge in the level encased in a bubble.They can resume play when another player breaks the bubble. A player can break the bubble by touching it, or by hitting it with a fireball, ice ball or Koopa shell. Players can also voluntarily encase themselves inside the bubble while a more skilled player traverses a difficult segment. If every character in a co-op session enters a bubble at the same time (whether through death or voluntarily), they will lose the level and must restart.\n\nIn addition to the main story mode, which can be played in either single-player or multiplayer modes, there are two dedicated multiplayer modes; \"Free-for-All Mode\", in which players complete courses together and compete to get the highest rank, and \"Coin Battle\", where they compete to collect the highest number of coins.\n\nWhen Mario, Luigi, Blue Toad, and Yellow Toad are celebrating Princess Peach's birthday in her castle, a large cake appears. Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings emerge from the cake and trap Peach inside. The cake is loaded onto Bowser's airship and it takes off, with Mario, Luigi, and the two Toads giving chase. The Toads in the castle grant them access to the new items, the Propeller Mushrooms and Penguin Suits.\n\nAfter traveling through several worlds fighting the Koopalings, Bowser Jr., and Kamek the Magikoopa, the Mario Bros. and the Toads arrive at Bowser's castle. Bowser is defeated but is revived by Kamek, who casts a magical spell that transforms him into a giant. Bowser chases after Mario and the others, destroying everything in his path, until Mario finds a large switch and triggers it, causing Bowser to fall through the ground and releasing Peach from her cage. Peach and Mario depart from the castle in a hot-air balloon, with Luigi and the Toads following behind.\n\nThe credits are shown as a minigame where the letters in the credits are written on blocks, which can be broken by the playable characters to get coins (all four characters appear, but only the ones controlled by players can get coins). After the credits, Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings help Bowser out of his unstable castle, which falls over and traps them.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" was created out of a desire to recreate the \"Super Mario\" series' single-player gameplay experience for multiple players. Shigeru Miyamoto, the head game developer at Nintendo, had been interested in creating a \"Super Mario\" game with multiplayer features since the series' beginnings with the 1983 arcade game, \"Mario Bros.\" Attempts to integrate cooperative multiplayer into \"Super Mario 64\", the first 3D game in the series, ultimately failed due to the hardware limitations of the Nintendo 64. With the faster CPU and enhanced graphical and memory capabilities of the Wii, Miyamoto and the rest of the development team were able to revisit this idea, as the hardware allowed the smooth display of enough enemies and items on the screen at once, and allowed a camera that could dynamically adapt to the players' movements, ensuring they constantly know what is the situation of their character. Miyamoto said that Princess Peach was not a playable character because of her dress, since making her skirt realistically move would require complex dedicated programming.\n\nMiyamoto wanted the game to be accessible to all players, and thus tried to balance its difficulty via features catering both to casual and hardcore \"Super Mario\" fans. After the release of \"New Super Mario Bros.\" for the Nintendo DS, which Miyamoto felt had not been hard enough in retrospect, he wanted to create a new \"Super Mario\" game which would provide a higher level of challenge for players who desired one. Simultaneously, the Super Guide feature, which would allow a player to watch a level get completed before trying again after failing a certain number of times, was included with the game in order to make the game accessible to unfamiliar players as well. The development team decided to include the feature as an option that would appear in a level after failing a certain number of times to prevent hindering the experience for more experienced players. As an extra incentive for advanced players, the team also added achievements that could be earned by completing the game without making the green block appear in any levels. The ability for a player to put themselves into a bubble and opt out of doing a level was devised so that both novice players and more experienced ones could play without interfering with each other. Miyamoto also hoped for the game to turn into a staple game for the Wii and achieve levels of success similar to that of \"New Super Mario Bros.\".\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" was worked on by several developers, some of whom had varying understandings of the design principalities of \"Super Mario\" games. Miyamoto, who served as the game's producer, helped the directors out with creating a general understanding of the ground rules for the game's design, writing out specification documents explaining the \"rules\" of how the game would work. This led to discussions and decisions over what was considered \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" for a Mario game; for instance, with the advent of the Ice Flower's ability to freeze enemies, the developers decided that it would be logical for the ice blocks to melt when shot with fireballs, and to float to the surface when submerged in water.\n\nThe music for \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" was composed and arranged by Shiho Fujii and Ryo Nagamatsu, with additional work provided by sound director Kenta Nagata. Series regular Koji Kondo was the sound advisor and did not write any new compositions, though some of his creations were re-arranged for the game. Charles Martinet returned to voice Mario and Luigi, along with Samantha Kelly as the Toads and Princess Peach, Kenny James as Bowser, and Caety Sagoian as Bowser Jr.\n\nOn May 30, 2009 the online version of the Japanese newspaper \"Nihon Keizai Shimbun\" reported that two new sequels would be released for the Wii: a sequel to \"Wii Fit\" titled \"Wii Fit Plus\", and a sequel to \"New Super Mario Bros.\" tentatively called \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\". The latter game was announced at E3 2009 and further shown off at Gamescom. To highlight the uniqueness of the game, Nintendo released the game in a red case instead of the traditional white box color that Wii games generally have. The game's announcement came following a standstill in Wii sales, which had led to a 52% drop in Nintendo's first-half earnings for 2009. Nintendo hoped that the game would help to increase sales of the Wii in the coming holiday season. In a Japanese retail briefing event prior to its release, Miyamoto expressed his faith that the game would retain strong sales stretching beyond its first year on the market.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" was released in Australia on November 11, 2009, and in North America on November 15. It was later released in Europe and Japan on November 20 and December 3, respectively. On October 29, 2010, it was released as a pack-in game with a red Wii console, alongside \"Wii Sports\" and a built-in download of \"Donkey Kong\", which was released to celebrate the 25th anniversary of \"Super Mario Bros.\" It was also included as part of a bundle release with a black Wii alongside a soundtrack CD for \"Super Mario Galaxy\" on October 23, 2011.\n\nAt E3 2011, a variation of \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\", dubbed \"New Super Mario Bros. Mii\", was showcased as a playable demo for Nintendo's then new console, the Wii U, allowing players to play as their Mii characters. It was a prototype designed to showcase the technology of the system. An enhanced port of the game was released in China for the Nvidia Shield TV on December 5, 2017, alongside other Wii and GameCube ports such as \"\". This updated version of the game features high definition graphics in 1080p and a reworked UI.\n\nIn November 2009, 24-year-old Australian James Burt purchased a copy of \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" several days before its release, as the store had mistakenly put it up for sale early, and ripped and uploaded the game disk online. Nintendo took down the game and sued Burt shortly afterwards, accusing him of violating copyright laws and depriving Nintendo of potential sales. The case was ultimately settled in January 2010, with Burt receiving a fine of AU$1.5 million as compensation for lost sales, as well as an additional fine of AU$100,000 as a part of Nintendo's legal fine. Burt was also forced to disclose the locations of all of his computers and electronic storage devices, as well as give access to his email, social networking and website accounts. Nintendo of Australia managing director Rose Lappin called the incident \"a global issue\", noting that thousands of copies of the game had been downloaded across the world before it was taken down. Burt later commented on the incident, calling his actions \"very stupid\" and asserting that the crime's repercussions were something that he would have to deal with for the rest of his life.\n\nThe game received praise for its multiplayer features following its showcase at E3, with critics praising its competitive aspects as well as its cooperative aspects, though the game's lack of online play was criticized as a missed opportunity. Many favorably compared the game to \"\", which similarly took its respective series' traditional gameplay and interlaced it with cooperative multiplayer. Chad Concelmo of Destructoid praised the game's \"creative and giggle-inducing\" levels and tighter control compared to \"New Super Mario Bros.\", while calling the multiplayer gameplay \"unique, addictive, and gloriously entertaining\" and giving the game a 9.5 score based on his initial impressions. Engadget's Andrew Yoon called the game \"playable, addictive and fresh\", and commended the game's camera system that could zoom out automatically to show off-screen players. Ars Technica praised the game as \"insidiously fun\" despite noting the simplicity of the game's graphics. Sophia Tong of GameSpot compared the game to \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" and called the new multiplayer feature \"a blast to play and hilarious to watch\". Eurogamer's Oli Welsh called the multiplayer \"a simple stroke of genius\". Chris Kohler of Wired praised the difficulty behind the multiplayer mode.\n\nThe game's presentation was another point of praise for some critics. CNET's Jeff Balakar called seeing a \"Super Mario\" game in 480p \"an eye-opening experience\", and praised the worlds' attentions to detail. IGN's Craig Harris also praised the widescreen graphics, noting that the game looked smooth in progressive widescreen mode despite the version of the game being displayed being an incomplete build, while Matt Cassamassina said that it looked \"crisp, clean [and] colorful\".\n\nSome reviewers were slightly critical of the game's multiplayer. Although CNET's three reviewers enjoyed the game, Balakar mused that the multiplayer gameplay was occasionally frustrating due to the chaos and tight screen space. CNET's Dan Ackerman, whilst praising \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\"s overall enjoyability, noted its strong similarity to its side-scrolling predecessors, musing that it felt \"firmly planted in the 2D era.\" MTV writer Russ Frushtick commented on the game's difficulty, comparing it to that of the NES game \"Contra\".\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Japanese gaming magazine \"Famitsu\" called it a \"masterpiece of 2D action\" and gave it a perfect 40/40, making it only the 13th game and the fourth Wii game to receive this score in the publication's 23-year history. \"Kotaku\" highly praised the game, calling it a reason to buy a Wii. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com regarded it as the true spiritual successor to 1991's \"Super Mario World\".\n\nCritics continued to praise the game's multiplayer features, with several singling it out as one of the game's most potent and worthwhile features. Patrick Kolan of IGN Australia called it the funnest 4-player experience since \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", and stated that it exceeded their initial expectations despite strong suspicions. Matt Wales of IGN UK lamented that the game worked as both a single-player and a multiplayer experience, but stated that it was at its best when played with multiple people. Nick Chester of Destructoid called the cooperative mode fun despite occasional frustrations, and stated that players would likely have more fun playing alongside other friends. GameSpot's Randolph Ramsay called the multiplayer \"initially great fun\", but also admitted that they found it tedious at times due to the sheer chaos that it led to. Craig Harris of IGN US praised the bubble system, calling it a smart design choice; however, he criticized the game's lack of any online multiplayer features, highlighting it as a particular point of dissatisfaction. Kolan also saw this as a shortcoming, criticizing a lack of online leaderboard features for the competitive multiplayer modes. Conversely, Wales did not see this omission as a major issue, arguing that sociality was a primary aspect that made the multiplayer enjoyable and that it was wise not to include the feature because of Nintendo's poor-quality online service, though they noted that a leaderboard would have been an admirable addition. \"GameSpy\" also gave the game leeway for its lack of online play, arguing that the medium is a primarily competitive experience whereas \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" required a cooperative experience in order to be thoroughly enjoyed. Brett Elston of GamesRadar+, highly critical of the four-player multiplayer, called it frustrating and stated that it felt cramped due to the several characters and small screen size, while advising that the game was best experienced with only two players.\n\nGameplay and controls were praised for their reminiscence of older 2D \"Super Mario\" titles; many singled out the use of the Wii Remote held sideways as the best way to play the game and praised it for calling back to the layout of the rectangular-shaped controller of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Ramsay lamented that the game's lack of support for the Wii's Classic Controller was disappointing. Thoughts on the game's integration of motion controls were varied. Kolan praised them as being \"easy, intuitive and unobtrusive – the three most critical aspects in any motion-controlled game\", while Ramsay stated that they were occasionally intrusive on general gameplay. Chester mostly praised the motion controls for being natural, taking exception with the need to hold a button and shake in order to carry items. Elston stated that the game's handling was \"compromised\" by the motion-controlled spin jump, which they stated the review team kept repeatedly activating by accident while trying to play the game.\n\nSome writers criticized \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" for feeling streamlined and banking off of the gameplay of its predecessors. Although Harris awarded the game an 8.9 out of 10 and deemed it a fun experience overall, he also was highly critical of it for \"playing it safe\", and, comparing it to \"Super Mario Galaxy\", called it a \"missed opportunity\" for Nintendo in terms of content. \"Edge\", while giving the game a positive score of 7/10, criticized it for having a lack of traditional \"Mario\" charm and low difficulty level. Elston argued that the game lacked the creativity of others in the series. \"The A.V. Club\" called the game \"the least essential \"Mario\" title to date\", stating that it lacks a strong concept and shows an underlying repetitiveness in \"Mario\" games. Conversely, \"Nintendo Power\" argued that the game works as a sequel because it maintains what made the original \"Mario\" games great while adding new features.\n\nCorbie Dillard of Nintendo Life pointed out the game's visual polish and smooth animations, but also stated that it did not hold the same level of splendor as other first party Wii releases. Ramsay also compared the game's graphics to other Nintendo-developed titles, stating that it lacked the level of polish that the previously-released \"Super Mario Galaxy\" had despite utilizing a bright and varied array of colors. Kolan praised the game's music as one of the best in the series, and lauded the game's sound design for calling back to previous \"Super Mario\" entries. Elston also shed praise on the game's soundtrack, as well as the enemy interaction with the in-game music.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" received the Best Wii Game award at the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards. IGN gave it the 2009 Wii Game of the Year Award. GameTrailers awarded it Best Wii Game of 2009. It also received the Best Family Game of the Year award in Yahoo's 2009 Game Awards, and the Nintendo Power Award for 2009's \"Wii Game of the Year\". GamesRadar named the game the 13th best on the Wii in 2016. IGN listed it as #8 on their list of the top 25 Wii games in 2012, and also as #103 on their list of the top 125 Nintendo games of all time in 2014. Polygon placed it at the #10 spot in their ranking of every \"Super Mario\" game, stating that the game's single-player was \"standard Mario fare\" while singling out the multiplayer experience as an incredible inclusion.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" was a commercial success, selling 936,734 units within four days of its release in Japan, the biggest debut for a Wii game in the region; its sales increased to 1,401,558 in the following week. Upon the game's release, sales for the Wii console increased by 128%, following a recent slowing in hardware sales for the system. \"New Super Mario Bros.

Many normal words are thought to be unhealthy for the plants, as they carry associations inimical to the proper growth of the nuts. An elaborate vocabulary of up to a thousand words and phrases has developed to replace the taboo vocabulary. The new vocabulary focuses on words involved with trips to harvest karuka nuts, and changes as words become known outside an area. The language is often spoken to control the magical properties of the higher elevations where the karuka grows, and to placate dangerous nature spirits like \"Kita-Menda\" (also called ), the ritual keeper of the wild dogs. \"Pandanus\" language generally should never be used outside the area where the trees grow, for fear of mountain spirits hearing it and coming down to investigate.\n\nAll ages and genders are expected to know the ritual language before entering the taboo areas, but outsiders who do not know the language may be allowed to speak Tok Pisin instead. As Tok Pisin has become more widely spoken in the area, pandanus languages have been spoken less. Newer generations also seem to be less afraid of the deep forest, and do not see much need for the protective talk. The Kewa and Imbongu pandanus languages are already thought to be dying out.\n\nThe grammar and vocabulary of pandanus language is based on the mother tongue, but a restricted and consolidated form, especially for names of living organisms. Often words are grouped into umbrella terms which do not have an equivalent concept in ordinary speech. Pandanus language words can also be loanwords from other languages.\n\n'Karuka,' as a term, is not treated consistently across all pandanus languages. For example, in standard Kewa language it is \"aga\", but in the Kewa pandanus language it is \"rumala agaa\". Conversely, in both ordinary Kalam language and its pandanus register, the word is the same: .\n\n\"Pandanus\" registers have been best documented for:\n\nThe Kalam pandanus language, called () or (), is also used when eating or cooking cassowary, as opposed to speaking (). It is not spoken out of fear of spirits, but to prevent the nuts from being watery, tough, or rotten; or in the case for cassowaries, to show respect to the bird. Kalam pandanus language may also be used outside the forest without penalty unlike other versions. This register is possibly thousands of years old, and may be inspired by older pandanus languages. \n\nThe Huli language has an avoidance register called () used for collecting \"Pandanus\" as well as hunting or traveling. , like many of the above, is used to evade malevolent bush spirits.\n\n"}

{"id": "49083688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49083688", "title": "Romanesque Revival architecture in the United Kingdom", "text": "Romanesque Revival architecture in the United Kingdom\n\nRomanesque Revival architecture, Norman Revival architecture or Neo-Norman styles of building were inspired by the Romanesque Architecture of the 11th and 12th centuries AD.\n\nIn the United Kingdom it started to appear as an architectural style in the 18th. century but reached its greatest popularity in the mid to latter years of the 19th. century. The style can be viewed as a strand of Gothic Revival architecture and part of the Historicist or Historismus styles of architecture that became popular in both Europe and Britain during the 19th. century. Early examples of the style in Germany of the 1820s and 1830s are referred to as Rundbogenstil or round arched style. In Britain the style was introduced by architects and their patrons, who had been on tours in Europe and it appears that the German and British styles of Romanesque developed largely independently. Initially in Britain the style was used for church building, but as the 19th. century progressed it was adapted for public buildings, museums, schools and commercial buildings, but rarely for domestic buildings. By the start of the 20th. century it had gone out of fashion and only occasionally were examples of the style built.\nThe development of the \"Norman\" revival style or \"Neo-Norman\" took place over a long time in the British Isles starting with Inigo Jones‘s re-fenestration of the White Tower of the Tower of London in 1637–38 and work at Windsor Castle by Hugh May for Charles II, but this was little more than restoration work. More surprising is the west door of Kenilworth Church, inserted in the tower in 1570 probably at the time of a visit of Queen Elizabeth. This appears to have been historic arch, sourced possibly from an unknown monastic building, Another early example of Romanesque revival is the south porch of North Scarle Church in Lincolnshire. Pevsner suggests that it might be Elizabethan, but late 17th. century seems more likely as the oak door seems to be original and probably of that date.\n\nIn the 18th century the use of round arched windows was thought of as being Saxon rather than Norman and examples of buildings with round arched windows include Shirburn Castle in Oxfordshire, Wentworth in Yorkshire and Enmore Castle in Somerset. At Allerton Mauleverer in Yorkshire St Martin’s Church was re-built for Richard Arundell in 1745. The church has been described as a \"proto-Neo-Norman\". While it gives the impression of a Romanesque revival church, with a massive crossing tower and round headed windows, yet it also has windows with gothic tracery and a hammerbeam nave roof. The architect is thought to have been John Vardy surveyor to the Office of Works.\n\nA further example of church building in the Romanesque revival style took place in 1792 when Elisa Wingfield commissioned plans from Samuel Pepys Cockerell for the conservation and rebuilding of St Peter's Church, Tickencote in Rutland. The church which contained much notable Romanesque decoration and an elaborate chancel arch appears to have been close to collapse. Cockerell encased the chancel, keeping the arch in position but the outer walls were completely re-built and the exterior ornamentation of arcades and round headed windows were replaced in new stonework. A new tower over a porch was built on the south side, which gave added stability to the older structure. The nave was completely re-built using some new romanesque mot is and copying others, such as the engaged columns, from those on the exterior of the chancel. This style of Romanesque revival architecture is very similar to the style that emerges in the 1840’s under architectects such as Thomas Penson and Benjamin Ferrey. Tickencote could be considered to mark the start of the Romanesque revival in church architecture. In Scotland the style started to emerge with the Duke of Argyll’s castle at Inverary, started in 1744, and castles by Robert Adam at Culzean (1771), Oxenfoord (1780–2), Dalquharran (1782–5), and Seton Palace (1792). In England James Wyatt used round arched windows at Sandleford Priory, Berkshire in 1780–79 and the Duke of Norfolk started to rebuild Arundel Castle, while Eastnor Castle in Herefordshire was built by Robert Smirke between 1812 and 1820. At Eastnor Smirke combines a rugged Romanesque with more subtle Gothic window tracery.\n\nIt was at this point that the Norman Revival became a recognisable architectural style. In 1817 Thomas Rickman published his \"An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation\". It was now realised that \"round-arch architecture\" was largely Romanesque in the British Isles and came to be described as Norman rather than Saxon. This distinction was finally recognised when Rickman’s article in \"Archaeologia\" (1832–33), was published by the Society of Antiquaries. The start of an \"archaeologically correct\" Norman Revival can be recognised in the architecture of Thomas Hopper. His first attempt at this style was at Gosford Castle in Armagh in Ireland, but far more successful was his Penrhyn Castle near Bangor in North Wales. This was built for the Pennant family, between 1820 and 1837. The style did not catch on for domestic buildings, though many country houses and mock castles were built in the Castle Gothic or Castellated style during the Victorian period, which were mixed Gothic styles.\n\nHowever, the \"Norman Revival\" did catch on for church architecture. It was Thomas Penson, a Welsh architect, who would have been familiar with Hopper’s work at Penrhyn, who developed Romanesque Revival church architecture. Penson was influenced by French and Belgian Romanesque architecture, and particularly the earlier Romanesque phase of German Brick Gothic. At St David’s Newtown, 1843–47 and St Agatha’s Llanymynech, 1845, he copies the tower of St. Salvator's Cathedral, Bruges. Other examples of Romanesque revival by Penson are Christ Church, Welshpool, 1839–1844, and the porch to Langedwyn Church. He was an innovator in the use of terracotta to produce decorative Romanesque mouldings, saving on the expense of stonework. Penson’s last church in the Romanesque Revival style was Rhosllannerchrugog, Wrexham of 1852\n\nA most remarkable example of Romanesque church building was St Mary’s Church at Wreay, near Carlisle. This was designed by Sarah Losh and built between 1841 and 1842. Losh had travelled widely on the Continent and particularly in Italy and drew inspiration from Romanesque sources. Losh is known to have read Thomas Hope's \"Historical Study of Architecture\" (1815), which uses the term \"Lombardic\" for the style brought into Italy from the early Christian churches of Constantinople, and she described St Mary's as being an \"unpolished mode of building\" that \"most approximates to early Saxon or modified Lombard\" This statement suggests that at the time of its design Losh was not aware of Thomas Rickman’s re-classification of Saxon and Norman architecture. While the appearance and layout of the church may be considered as Romanesque, her free interpretation of the decoration on the woodwork and the arched stone windows and doors is anticipating the styles of the Arts and Crafts movement, while the arcading of the apse certainly has a Byzantine feel to it.\n\nThe early years of the 1840s saw a considerable upsurge of interest in the developing Romanesque revival style by some of the leading architects of the period. During the 19th century the architecture selected for Anglican churches depended on the churchmanship of particular congregations. Whereas high churches and Anglo-Catholic, which were influenced by the Oxford Movement, were built in Gothic Revival architecture; low churches and Broad churches of the period were often built in the Romanesque Revival style. The architects specialising in Romanesque revival took their designs from different local styles of the European Romanesque.\n\nAnother architect who popularised the Romanesque revival style was Edmund Sharpe, who set up his practice at Lancaster in 1835. At Cambridge he had been a great friend of William Whewell and presumably of the polymath and architectural historian Professor Robert Willis. He was awarded a travelling scholarship to study the early architecture of Germany and Southern France and supplied Thomas Rickman with information. However, Sharpe despite being an architectural historian of some note, built churches that were much freer interpretations of the Romanesque and German Brick Gothic and might be considered less \"archaeologically correct\".\nFour of Sharpe's earliest churches – St Saviour, Bamber Bridge (1836–37); St Mark, Witton (1836–38); and St Paul, Farington, near Leyland (1839–40) – were in the Romanesque style, which he chose because \"no style can be worked so cheap as the Romanesque\". They \"turned out to be little more than rectangular 'preaching boxes'… with no frills and little ornamentation; and many of them were later enlarged\". The only subsequent churches in which Sharpe used Romanesque elements St Mary's Church, Conistone in Wharfedale (1846); and St Paul, Scotforth in south Lancaster (1874–6). Sharpe's final essay in the Romanesque Revival style St Paul's Church, Scotforth, was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as a \"strange building\" and \"an anachronism, almost beyond belief\". Sharpe had retired from his architectural practice in 1851 He then pursued a career in railway engineering. In 1874, when he was aged 68, he returned to architecture and designed this church which was opened in 1876. The church had used terracotta in a similar fashion to his earliest churches and it can only be assumed that its anachronistic appearance was that he had used a design that he had prepared at least 20 years earlier.\n\n The work of Benjamin Ferrey can be considered to be similar to that of Thomas Penson, based on the English and French Romanesque traditions. An early example is his church of St Nicholas at East Grafton in Wiltshire, built in 1842–44. Here the chancel terminates in an apse and the west has overlapping arcading and chevron decoration over the entrance door. Central crossing tower and arcaded windows on the west frontis approached through a stone Romanesque Lych gate.\n\nA more important work by Ferrey is the Church of St James the Great at Morpeth, Northumberland. The church, which is supposed to be modelled on the cathedral of Monreale in Sicily, was built between 1844 and 1846. The unusual arched gate is acceptably Sicilian in inspiration and is similar to the portico at the cathedral at Monreale, but the rest of the composition has much more in common with French and Belgian Romanesque. A further church in this style is Christ Church in Melplash in Dorset of 1845–46. This has a heavy crossing tower and in many respects resembles the Church of St. James the Great at Morpeth.\n\nSt Michael and All Angels Barton le Street, North Yorkshire.\nThis church was very extensively rebuilt in 1869–71 by William Perkin and his sons of Leeds. Unlike Tickencote there is no record of the church that was replaced. The building contains an extensive and impressive range of genuine romanesque, but these seem to have been largely repositioned. The pews and some other furnishings are in Romanesque revival style. The rebuilding was financed by Hugo Francis Meynell-Ingram.\n\nIn the 1860s Romanesque architecture became a popular style of architecture for Dissenting chapels. Possibly this was intended to give the impression that they were churches similar to Anglican churches and they are often referred to as churches rather than chapels. This form of architecture was often chosen by the Baptists. This architecture is an adapted and debased form of Italianate Romanesque as seen at the Potter's Bar Old Baptist Church in Hertfordshire in 1859. The Baptist Church in Brown Street Salisbury of the 1880s is similar in bright red brick and was built in the 1880s. It is noticeably more \"archaeologically correct\" in its use of arched windows and the entrance door. A Baptist Chapel of 1870 by the Lincoln architects Drury and Mortimer, the Mint Lane Baptist Chapel in Lincoln is in a debased Italianate Romanesque revival style but has a surprising tower in the castellated Gothic style.\n\nThe Romanesque revival was also a style of architecture that appealed to Jewish communities and there are examples of Synagogues in this style. \nOne of these is the synagogue built adjacent to the docks at Grimsby in Lincolnshire.\n\nThe earliest example of Romanesque revival architecture in Scotland is the West Kirk, Sandgate, Ayr. By the architect William Gale for the Presbyterian Free Church and built in 1844–45. The columns used for the windows are very similar to those used by Edmund Sharpe at Scotford church.\nIn Scotland the Presbyterians occasionally built in the Romanesque revival style, but only later in the 19th century. \nSt Conan’s Kirk Lochawe, Agyll and Bute is an extraordinary early 20th century church on the shore of Loch Awe, built by Walter Douglas Campbell, brother of the 1st Lord Blythswood, was started in 1881, but not completed until 1930. The kirk is largely Romanesque in style, but is also mixed with other completely unrelated styles. Another church is Cranshaws in Berwickshire. Here the 1739 church was rebuilt in 1899 by architect George Fortune in Romanesque Revival style.\n\nInterest in Romanesque Revival Architecture was renewed by Sir Alfred Waterhouse's Natural History Museum in Kensington, which was built between 1873 and 1881. It was built in shades of buff coloured terracotta and opened the way for the Romanesque style to be used for other buildings, apart from churches. Waterhouse tended to mix the architectural styles, often using decorative Romanesque arches to provide impressive entrances for his buildings, and popularised the deep red terracotta produced by manufacturer's in the Wrexham and Ruabon area of North-East Wales. This included parts of the Prudential Insurance building in London and the entrance to Strangeways Prison.\n\nWaterhouse inspired other architects to build using terracotta and this material was used by William Watkins, a Lincoln architect who very successfully used a deep red Ruabon terracotta for the Lincoln Christ's Hospital Girls School of 1893. An earlier building by Watkins of 1873, was originally built as a warehouse at 42 Silver Street, Lincoln. This uses artificial stone for Romanesque columns and arches to embellish the frontage. \n\nSt Aidan's Church, Leeds is a massive basilica church built in the tradition of Waterhouse, using red terracotta brickwork. The design was won by competition in 1889 and the church was built between 1891 and 1894 by the Newcastle architects RJ Johnson and A Crawford Hick. The style is a hybrid of Italian, French and German Romaneque and the Corbel table or moulded stringcourse below the eaves was based on that of Lund Cathedral in Sweden. The inside is sumptuously decorated with mosaic decoration by Sir Frank Brangwyn in the apse and a multi-coloured marble font with Romanesque arcading. The interior columns of the basilica have ornamental capitals in the Byzantine style.\n\nIn the 20th.century the use of the Romanesque revival style in church architecture appears to be restricted to brick built churches and often these churches have similarities with churches built in the Byzantine revival style, which became more popular in the early years of the 20th century. \nChurches in the Romanesque revival style include All Saints, Bute Avenue, Petersham, Richmond-upon-Thames. This Romanesque revival church was designed by J Kelly and completed in 1908.\n\nAn even later example of the style is St Francis, Linden Road, Bournville, consecrated in 1925. This church was designed by Harvey and Wicks, the architects of the Bournville Estate\n"}

Bart, wanting to raise her spirits, decides to nominate her for the Teacher of the Year Award. Edna and the Simpsons are flown to Orlando, Florida for the event.\n\nEdna Krabappel tells her students to write a paper on World War I, due in three weeks. After class, Edna and Principal Skinner's apple picking date is cancelled when Skinner's mother, Agnes, interrupts. At the Simpson house, Bart is distracted from writing his paper, and at the end of the three weeks, he still has not started the assignment. The day before the date of submission, he asks Grampa for help. Edna rejects Bart's paper and tells him that he will have to do it correctly after school. As Bart finishes the assignment after school, supervised by Edna herself, he observes Skinner cancel a movie date with Edna when Agnes calls. Bart consoles Edna, and she reluctantly accepts his offer to accompany her to the movie.\n\nAt home, Lisa suggests that Bart nominate Edna for the Teacher of the Year Award. When Edna is informed of her Teacher of the Year nomination, she thanks Bart at the ensuing press conference. Skinner is about to congratulate Edna when Agnes calls again. Bart informs his family that, as nominator, he and his family are going to Orlando, Florida.\n\nAt Springfield Elementary, Skinner is despondent at the thought that Edna could leave the school. Groundskeeper Willie lends Skinner his sports car so he can go to Orlando, where he surprises Edna with a kiss under the fireworks display. They are interrupted by Agnes, whom Skinner brought along, much to Edna's ire. During preparation for the awards ceremony, Skinner is shocked when he hears that the winner receives enough money to be able to retire. He requests Bart to help him sabotage Edna's chances of winning, though he has to resort to blackmail after Bart initially refuses. At the ceremony, each finalist must ask their nominating student a question. When Bart is asked what Edna would like to teach the world, he pretends to be illiterate, until Skinner tells the truth. Skinner asks Edna to marry him, and she agrees. Edna loses the award, but looks forward to marrying Skinner.\n\n\"Special Edna\" was written by Dennis Snee and directed by Bob Anderson as part of the fourteenth season of \"The Simpsons\" (2002–03).

American musician Little Richard guest starred in the episode as himself.\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 5, 2003. It was viewed in approximately 9.0 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 8.5, the episode finished 18th in the ratings for the week of December 30, 2002 – January 5, 2003. It was the second highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, following an NFC post-game show. On December 6, 2011, \"Special Edna\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Fourteenth Season\". Staff members Al Jean, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, Tom Gammill, Matt Warburton, Bob Anderson, Mike B.

Deleted scenes from the episode were also included in the box set.\n\nDVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented: \"I’ve liked episodes that focus on Krapappel, but on the other hand, her relationship with Skinner has always been a bit of a dud.

I think the real EPCOT is pretty fun, actually, but the program delivers some amusing pokes at it.\" \"Special Edna\" was named the best episode of the fourteenth season of \"The Simpsons\" by \"IGN\" writers Robert Canning, Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski. They commented: \"First and foremost, this episode, as the title implies, is a nice spotlight on poor, overworked, underpaid Mrs. Krabappel. Krabappel's relationship with Principal Skinner takes center stage [...] But there's a ton more to this episode, including Grampa's story about serving as a four year old in World War I; Milhouse showing up with his uncle to give Bart a ride in a Blackhawk Helicopter; and a trip to a very thinly veiled parody of Disney World's EPCOT Center [...] that is filled with spot on parodies like the World of Tomorrow ride, which is a horribly dated 1960s take on the far future of the year 1984.\"\n\nThe episode title is a reference to the shortened form of \"special education\".\n\n"}

The 183rd episode of the series, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 18, 2009. In the episode, Cartman poses as a superhero vigilante named \"The Coon\", who grows increasingly jealous of the popularity and success of a rival superhero named \"Mysterion\".\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It was originally conceived as an episode about the economic recession, but those elements were later adapted into the future episode, \"Margaritaville\". \"The Coon\" generated a great deal of speculation about the true identity of Mysterion. Parker and Stone originally said there was no specific answer to the question. However, his identity is finally revealed in the fourteenth season episode \"Mysterion Rises\".\n\nThe episode parodied several dark-toned comic book films that had been recently released at the time, including \"The Spirit\", \"Watchmen\" and \"The Dark Knight\". It received generally positive reviews and, according to Nielsen Media Research, was seen by 3.27 million households the week it aired. Comedian Bruce Vilanch, who is mocked in the episode, sent a thank you card to Parker and Stone after the episode aired. \"The Coon\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray along with the rest of the thirteenth season on March 16, 2010. \"The Coon\" was also released on DVD in \"The Little Box of Butters\" on September 28, 2010. \"The Coon\" was re-released once more on DVD and Blu-ray as a \"bonus episode\" with the complete fourteenth season.\n\nDonning a disguise modeled after a raccoon, Cartman becomes a vigilante dubbed \"The Coon\", who attempts to wipe out crime in South Park. Though Cartman tries to raise awareness about The Coon through word of mouth, nobody pays much attention to the Coon's efforts. When he reports \"crimes\" (such as mistaking a man innocently trying to kiss his date for a rapist) to the police department, he is threatened with jail time and snubbed off. During class, Cartman tries to hype up an appearance from the Coon, saying he will be on roof of a Walgreens later that evening. Cartman (as the Coon) shows up to the spot to find another child superhero named \"Mysterion\", who is far more successful in garnering appreciation as a crime stopping icon from the police and South Park citizens who want to know just \"Who is Mysterion?\" Cartman is angered by his lack of popularity and the attention Mysterion is receiving.\n\nCoon decides to rid the town of Mysterion, enlisting the help of Professor Chaos (Butters) and his sidekick General Disarray (Dougie). Unlike the Coon, Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as familiar to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others. In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten the destruction of a hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out that this is not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' aluminum foil armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed.\n\nDespite the threat of imprisonment, Mysterion unmasks himself, showing the television viewers only the portion of his face that looks similar to almost all of Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class. The crowd, however, is shocked to learn Mysterion's identity and, much to the regret of all except Coon, who says that he knew who Mysterion was, even calling him out on it at one point (though this helps the audience little as Cartman claimed that practically everyone in his class was Mysterion at times), Mysterion is hauled to prison. With Professor Chaos, General Disarray and Mysterion defeated, Cartman now perceives that he is the superhero in South Park and that every town should have a Coon like him.\n\n\"The Coon\" was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on March 18, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Like most \"South Park\" episodes, \"The Coon\" was first conceived by Parker and fellow co-founder Matt Stone within a week of the episode's broadcast date. Kenny, Kyle and Stan were originally planned to be made superheroes as well as Cartman, and for the episode to revolve around a group of superheroes in the style of \"Watchmen\", a graphic-novel-based film that had been released earlier that month. They started working on sketches of the other superhero costumes, but Cartman and his alter-ego, the Coon, were finished first. From the start, Parker and Stone wrote Cartman as caring more about his superhero image than fighting crime, but as they worked further on the episode, it began to take up more and more of the story until they decided to make Cartman the only superhero of the four boys.\n\nParker and Stone long planned to create an episode about the economic recession, and originally planned for Cartman to dress as a superhero named \"The Coon\" and fight the economy. This is why the opening scene of \"The Coon\" involves Cartman discussing the poor economic state of the nation and the election of U.S. President Barack Obama. Eventually, Cartman would discover the recession stemmed from the sale of Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville blenders, and he would have to battle singer Jimmy Buffett and investor Warren Buffett, who would be portrayed as Jimmy's brother. Eventually, the idea was scrapped, and \"The Coon\" turned into an episode revolving entirely around a comic book film parody. Elements of the economic recession and the Margaritaville blenders were eventually incorporated into future episode \"Margaritaville\".\nThe identity of Mysterion is never revealed in \"The Coon\". After the episode aired, the question \"Who is Mysterion?\" became a frequently asked question at the FAQ for the official \"South Park\" website, \"South Park Studios\". The answer posted at that site was that \"there is no answer\", and that only Trey Parker and Matt Stone actually know. Parker said it was one of the most common questions he was asked about the show, along with the identity of Cartman's father, which was resolved in the fourteenth season episode \"201\". Parker and Stone originally said there was no actual answer to Mysterion's identity, as they never chose a specific character to be him. In the original ending of the episode, after Mysterion is arrested, Kyle is shown to be in prison and it is believed he is the superhero. However, the real Mysterion visits him, and Kyle explains he pretended to be Mysterion so the real superhero could remain free and continue fighting crime. As a thank you, Mysterion revealed his identity by showing his face, but like in the actual episode, the viewer cannot determine who he is because all the children look alike without hats. The ending was ultimately cut because Parker and Stone decided it took too much time for a simple throwaway gag and to show that Kyle was not Mysterion. The clip is available as a deleted scene in the thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray sets. The superhero characters from \"The Coon\" returned in the fourteenth season episodes \"\", \"Mysterion Rises\" and \"Coon vs. Coon and Friends\", in which Mysterion is revealed.\n\nKeo Thongkham and Kevin Dalton, who serve as \"South Park\" storyboard artists, drew the detailed image of Mysterion that appeared in a news broadcast within the episode. Within a week of the episode's original broadcast, the online retailer Zazzle and South Park Studios, the official \"South Park\" website, released T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode, including one with an image of Cartman as the Coon, and one of Mysterion with the words, \"Who is Mysterion?\"\n\n\"The Coon\" is primarily a parody of dark-toned comic book movies. \"The Dark Knight\" (2008), \"The Spirit\" (2008) and \"Watchmen\" (2009) are the most commonly referred to films, but others such as \"Spider-Man 3\" (2007) are also frequently referenced. Matt Stone said the episode started as a parody specifically of \"Watchmen\", but then elements of other comic book films were added as the writing progressed. The music used in \"The Coon\" is inspired by the style of film scores by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer, both of whom collaborated on the scores for \"Batman Begins\" (2005) and \"The Dark Knight\". To promote the Coon, Cartman uses a similar tagline as was used to promote \"Darkman\", printing shirts asking \"Who is The Coon?\" The Coon and Mysterion use deep and ominous voices similar to that used by Christian Bale in the Batman films and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach in \"Watchmen\". Stone said he found Bale's voice particularly annoying in \"The Dark Knight\", and found it amusing that so many comic book movies had heroes whose voices were so low, it sounded like they were \"whispering, like you've been up all night smoking\".\n\nCartman and Mysterion both refer to themselves as \"the symbol this town needs\", a line from \"The Dark Knight\", and Cartman encourages Butters to film a video threatening to blow up a hospital, the same as the Joker from a scene in that film. The opening shot of \"The Coon\" is also inspired by a sequence from \"Watchmen\": both feature a close-up of a city sidewalk and zoom out to someone looking down from the top of a tall skyscraper. A poster of the Coon shown at Cartman's Coonicon 2009 is inspired by the front cover of \"The Dark Knight Returns\", the Batman graphic novel by Frank Miller. Other common comic book film traits parodied in \"The Coon\" include costumes that do little to actually conceal secret identities, trophies adorning superhero secret lairs, and sudden disappearing exits and entrances.\n\nCartman's Coonicon 2009 convention is held at the Airport Hilton, the same place where he holds his \"ginger pride\" event in the episode \"Ginger Kids\" and the AIDS benefit in the episode \"Tonsil Trouble\". Butters dresses up as Professor Chaos, and Dougie dresses as General Disarray, both of which are the supervillain alter egos they first take on in the sixth season episode \"Professor Chaos\". Based on the physique of the Coon, Butters considers heavyset gay entertainers Bruce Vilanch and Harvey Fierstein as suspects for his secret identity. Vilanch sent a card to Parker and Stone after \"The Coon\" aired, thanking them for referring to him in the episode. Cartman plans to purchase detonators for his TNT from Ace Hardware, a real-life Illinois-based hardware company chain. Cartman refers to the economic recession as one of the primary factors that has led to an increase in crime. News footage of a group of South Park residents talking about Mysterion which focuses on a man with gold teeth and a blue baseball cap was inspired by the Crichton Leprechaun sighting YouTube video.\n\nIn its original American broadcast, \"The Coon\" was watched by 3.27 million overall households, according to the Nielsen Media Research. The episode received a 1.8 rating/5 share among adults aged between 18 and 49, making it the most watched cable entertainment program in that age group for the week of March 16 to 22.\n\nThe episode received generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of \"iF\" magazine said, \"The mockery of comic book based movies is perfectly done...Though not quite as funny as last week’s 'The Ring', 'The Coon' is right up there as a classic episode, ... A beacon of hope in the sometimes drab world of television,\" while at the same time, he believed the episode title, \"The Coon\" (being a well-known ethnic slur against black people) was a jab intended for Barack Obama, the first African American U.S. President.\n\nPercy Olsen, television editor for \"Student Life\", said \"The Coon\" was an improvement over \"The Ring\" because it was less heavy-handed in its morals. Olsen also said it raised the question, \"What ever happened to the goofy superhero movies? From Batman to the Hulk, it seems like every comic book hero movie has been given a splotch of mud and some dim lighting before being sent out the door.\" Genevieve Koski of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode a B+ grade, although she did not like the \"non-reveal\" ending. She also said the target material for \"The Coon\" is too easy, but she said the episode was \"really likable\" and she particularly liked Cartman's growing frustration when his superhero persona is ignored. Travis Fickett of IGN also said he did not like the ending and, although he liked Butters' part in the episode and the riffing on comic book stereotypes, Fickett felt the episode lacked any \"brilliant moments\" and \"ultimately runs out of steam with the super-hero riff\". Mitchell Geller of \"The Tufts Daily\" said the episode would be more enjoyable to people familiar with the comic book film franchise it was spoofing than it would be for those who are not, although he said Cartman \"never ceases to be funny\". Comic book writer and creator of Watchmen, Alan Moore, was reported to have appreciated the episode. \n\n\"The Coon\", along with the thirteen other episodes from \"South Park\"'s thirteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on March 16, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, a collection of deleted scenes, and a special mini-feature \"Inside Xbox: A Behind-the-Scenes Tour of South Park Studios\", which discussed the process behind animating the show with \"Inside Xbox\" host Major Nelson.\n\n\"The Coon\" was also released as a special \"bonus episode\", on the season fourteen DVD on April 26, 2011, as well as the two-disc DVD collection \"A Little Box of Butters\".\n\n"}

{"id": "59041785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59041785", "title": "Turoń", "text": "Turoń\n\nIn Polish folklore, Turoń (Turuń, Toruń) is a kind of festive monstrosity in the form of a black, horned and shaggy animal with a flopping jaw. Its appearance can be noticed at folk events during the period after Christmas, yet most likely in times of Carnival and before the Lent begins. the name is dereved from the word \"tur\", i.e., \"aurochs\".\n\nA person that played the role of Turoń, covered himself with a cloth sheet or sheep skin, holding a wooden pole in front of him, ended with a bull’s head with flopping jaw, horns (sometimes real ones – bovine – or simply, wooden ones), the head covered with rabbit skin or some other animal skin.\n\nA person playing the part of Turoń has to walk hunched and covered with cloth sheet or sheep skin so the whole appearance would remind of a real animal. Sometimes, Turoń was led on a rope.\n\nWhenever the carolers’ group entered a house, the Turoń started his play by jumping around, dancing, neighing like a donkey. Turoń is especially fond of playing tricks on women, which he chases around the house, provokes and sometimes hits with its jaw. During the carol singing Turoń claps his jaw to the rhythm of the song and rings the bell hung on its neck.\n\nTuroń’s muzzle is made of thin wood, covered with rabbit skin and it’s made so big so it can swallow an apple whole or drink a glass of vodka in one shot. It is believed that the alcohol, consumed by the beast in nearly every visited household, makes its behavior that insolent. In its hands Turoń’s holding two sticks which he uses to smack the floor with every move, it jumps over them and over the stools in the house as well.\n\nAt some point of its play there comes an important moment in singing: the Turoń faints, and then everyone tries to resuscitate it by massage, lighting the hay as a kind of an incense, blowing wind under its tail, pouring vodka into the muzzle of effigy and undoing hexes. After that part Turoń gets back up and begins to frolic again, which often announces the coming end of the carolers’ visit.\n\nIn every region of Poland, where the custom occurs, it differs in its form. The Cracow’s Turoń accompanies the carolers that are carrying a star during the Epiphany \n\n(6 of January). It follows the carolers and when they enter a household, the Turoń tackles anyone who stares for too long at the star or its bearers.\n\nIn Kieleckie region, town folks walk around the village with an aurochs (also called as “turuń”) during the last week of the Carnival. A similar custom is known in Tarnów, where the Turoń is accompanied by other figures: Tatar (Turkish man) and Żyd (Jew). In vicinity of Mielec, people walk with Turoń on Christmas Eve.\n\nWhenever the Turoń becomes unbearable for the householder and his family, they sing a song to banish the Turoń:\n\n\"Idź, turoniu, do domu,\n\nnie zawadzaj nikomu,\n\nnie tuś się wychował,\n\nnie tu będziesz nocował.\"\n\nWhich loosely translates into:\n\n„Go now, Turoń, go home\n\nDon’t you bother any more souls\n\nHere’s not the place you live\n\nThis not the place you shall sleep.”\n\nAfter that song, the householder gives to the carolers a “get off ransom” in the form of money and a gift from the pantry. Then, the carolers thank for the treats and they go to the next house.\n\nAccording to Oskar Kolberg: “(…) I recall a research about aurochs, brought up by a German – Harius. Aurochs as an animal is a foreign name to the eastern languages and it refers to a bull – hence it belongs to terminology and customs of pagan Slavic culture, in which the aurochs was an emblem of the Sun and in its name there was a holiday called Turzyce. Nonetheless Turuń has to be considered as such; since the day of Christmas a new Sun is born, brighter and longer it shines with coming of a new summer.”\n\nTuroń is a symbol of fertility, it’s a way of wishing through gestures. It poked the householders with his horns to pass on the fertility.\n"}

{"id": "13587755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13587755", "title": "Young worker safety and health", "text": "Young worker safety and health\n\nAround the world, nearly 250 million children, about one in every six children, ages 5 through 17, are involved in child labor. Children can be found in almost any economic sector. However, at a global level, most of them work in agriculture (70%). Approximately 2.4 million adolescents aged 16 to 17 years worked in the U.S. in 2006. Official employment statistics are not available for younger adolescents who are also known to work, especially in agricultural settings.\n\nIn 2006, 30 youth under 18 died from work-related injuries in the U.S. In 2003, an estimated 54,800 work-related injuries and illnesses among youth less than 18 years of age were treated in hospital emergency departments. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reports that only one-third of work-related injuries are seen in emergency departments, therefore it is likely that approximately 160,000 youth sustain work-related injuries and illnesses each year. The highest number of teen worker fatalities occur in agricultural work and the retail trades, according to recent data. Across Europe, 18- to 24-year-olds are at least 50% more likely to be injured in the workplace than more experienced workers.\n\nBecause of their biologic, social, and economic characteristics, young workers have unique and substantial risks for work-related injuries and illnesses. Besides retail and agriculture, other areas of high risk for work-related injuries include construction and work activities involving motor vehicles and mobile machinery. Although safety requirements and child labor laws prohibit or restrict teen employment in certain kinds of industries and occupations, young workers may yet face risks on the job because an employer or a young employee may not be aware of applicable laws and may not be aware that a hazard exists, because the young employee may lack experience, or because there is inadequate training or supervision.\n\nChild labor is the employment of children under an age determined by law or custom. This practice is considered exploitative by many countries and international organizations. Child labor was utilized to varying extents through most of history, but entered public dispute with the beginning of universal schooling, with changes in working conditions during industrialization, and with the emergence of the concepts of workers' and children's rights. Child labor is still common in some places. Even after passing child labor legislation, developing countries in particular still feature informal economies made up of child workers who are more exposed to human rights violations in the workplace.\n\nThere are roughly 250,000 children who work on U.S. farms, that do not live on the farm, and another 30 million children who visit farms annually. About every three days a child dies on a U.S. farm. In 2004, most youth work fatalities occurred in the agriculture sector. About two thirds of these fatalities could be attributed to transportation accidents. According to the \"Occupational injuries among young workers\" report, most of these transportation accidents occurred either by truck or by tractor. Tractor accidents alone counted for 1/4 of the youth worker fatalities from 1993 to 2002. For workers 13 years old and younger, agricultural fatalities accounted for 42 out of the 49 total fatalities for that age group between 1998 and 2002. There are fewer child labor restrictions on family-owned or operated farms; workers as young as 13 can legally operate tractors on farms if their family owns it or operates it.\n\nExperiences and exposures across different sectors of agriculture vary greatly. For example, children who worked on tobacco farms experienced a number of negative health effects including nausea, heat exhaustion, and burning eyes.\n\nBetween the years 1998 and 2002, construction accidents accounted for 18% of youth worker fatalities, making construction the second most deadly industry for a young worker to be employed in during that time period. A significant number of young worker fatalities in this sector resulted from work that the young worker was not legally authorized to do. For example, 16-year-old workers accounted for almost 20% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector between 1998 and 2002, even though workers 16 and younger are legally unauthorized to enter a construction site; if they do work for the construction industry, they can only work in an office or sales department. Additionally, Hispanic and Latino young workers made up 35% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector. Hispanics make up 14.4% of the United States' general population.\n\nThe second highest number of workplace fatalities between 1993 and 1997 among workers younger than age 18 occurred in the retail trades (e.g., restaurants and retail stores). Between 1992 and 2000, 63% of these deaths were due to assaults and violent acts, most of which were homicides. Homicide associated with robbery is the probable cause for one fourth to one half of all young worker fatalities in retail trades. Handling cash, working alone or in small numbers, and working in the late evening and early morning hours may contribute to workplace homicides [NIOSH 1996a].\n\nIn 1998, more than half of all work-related nonfatal injuries to young workers occurred in retail trades, more than 60% of which were eating and drinking establishments. Cuts in retail trades were the most common type of injury treated in emergency departments, followed by burns in eating and drinking establishments and bruises, scrapes, and scratches in other retail settings. Common hazards in restaurants include using knives to prepare food, handling hot grease from fryers, working near hot surfaces, and slipping on wet or greasy floors.\nIn addition, certain types of machinery prohibited for use by young workers under current child labor laws are commonly found in retail establishments—including food slicers, paper balers, forklifts, dough and batter mixers, and bread cutting machines. Young workers may choose to operate unfamiliar machinery to prove responsibility, independence, or maturity, or they may be instructed to do so by an employer who is unaware of child labor laws or chooses to disregard them.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) within the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is the Federal agency with primary responsibility for setting and enforcing standards to promote safe and healthful working conditions for all workers. Employers are responsible for becoming familiar with standards applicable to their establishments and for ensuring a safe working environment.\n\nThe U.S. Public Health Service has a Healthy People 2020 objective to reduce emergency department injury rates among young workers, ages 15 through 19, to 4.9 injuries/100 full-time equivalents by 2020. The rate in 2007 was 5.3 injuries/100 full-time equivalents.\n\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plays a lead role in efforts to reduce injuries and illnesses among working youth by conducting and supporting science to guide prevention efforts, disseminating findings, and working with others in collaborative outreach.\n\nThe NIOSH funds the National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety.\n\nA workplace may be fully compliant with OSHA regulations and yet may place young workers at risk of injury or illness if applicable federal and state child labor laws are not followed. One study estimated that more than three-fourths of employers of young workers were unfamiliar with child labor laws. Lack of awareness of occupational safety and health laws by young workers, adults, and employers has been identified as a major obstacle to preventing injury and illness in young workers. The primary Federal law governing the employment of workers under age 18 is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, which is enforced by the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration within DOL. Child labor provisions of the FLSA are designed to protect the educational opportunities of minors and prohibit their employment in jobs that pose safety or health risks. The FLSA does not cover all young workers. The FLSA applies to an entire business enterprise if the enterprise has annual gross revenues of $500,000 or more. Child Labor Regulation No. 3 restricts hours and specifies allowable employment activities for workers aged 14 and 15.\n\nStates may also have their own child labor laws that are stricter than federal laws. If a state child labor law is less protective than federal law, or if no applicable state law exists, Federal child labor laws apply.\n\n\n"}

Women were allowed to eat forbidden food and to eat with men; the priests were no longer to offer human sacrifices; the many prohibitions surrounding the high chiefs were relaxed. \n\nKamehameha I, the conqueror of the islands, had just died; his son Liholiho succeeded him (and was later known as King Kamehameha II). He came to power amid scenes of grief and licence. \n\nThe usually strict rules of the Hawaiian religion and social system, known as kapu, were in abeyance during the usual mourning period. Women ate pork and bananas; people had sexual intercourse with whomever they pleased; routine life was completely overthrown.

He took refuge in his canoe and after sailing about aimlessly for two days on the west coast of the Big Island of Hawaii, he landed and ate the feast of dogmeat (ordinarily reserved for women) that the chiefesses had prepared for him. Messengers were then sent over the islands announcing that eating was free and the kapu had fallen.\nThe downfall of the old religion was further hastened by the arrival of Christian missionaries a few months later.\n\n\n"}
