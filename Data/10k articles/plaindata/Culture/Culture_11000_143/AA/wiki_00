It points out the influence that social and political conditions can have over a community's perception of the status of a language or dialect. The adage was popularized by the sociolinguist and Yiddish scholar Max Weinreich, who heard it from a member of the audience at one of his lectures.\n\nThis statement is usually attributed to Max Weinreich, a specialist in Yiddish linguistics, who expressed it in Yiddish:\nThe earliest known published source is Weinreich's article \"Der YIVO un di problemen fun undzer tsayt\" ( \"The YIVO Faces the Post-War World\"; literally \"The YIVO and the problems of our time\"), originally presented as a speech on 5 January 1945 at the annual YIVO conference. Weinreich did not give an English version.\n\nIn the article, Weinreich presents this statement as a remark of an auditor at a lecture series given between 13 December 1943 and 12 June 1944:\nWeinreich observed that the phrase is a \"wonderful expression of the social plight of Yiddish\". In his lecture, he discusses not just linguistic, but also broader notions of \"\"yidishkeyt\"\" (ייִדישקייט – lit. Jewishness).\n\nThe sociolinguist and Yiddish scholar Joshua Fishman suggested that he might have been the auditor at the Weinreich lecture, and has subsequently been cited as the originator of the army-navy statement in several references. However, Fishman was assuming that the exchange took place at a conference in 1967, more than twenty years later than the YIVO lecture (1945) and in any case does not fit Weinreich's description.\n\nSome scholars believe that Antoine Meillet had earlier said that a language is a dialect with an army, but there is no contemporary documentation of this.\n\nJean Laponce suggested in 2004 that Hubert Lyautey (1854–1934) may have originated the phrase at a meeting of the Académie française, and proposed to call it the \"Loi de Lyautey\" 'Lyautey's law'. But again there is no good evidence for this.\n\nRandolph Quirk adapted the definition to \"A language is a dialect with an army and a flag\" (adding a defense policy and a national airline).\n\n\n"}

There are no strict rules regarding the act of blackening itself, only that the couple must be rendered messy and uncomfortable, and that as many people as possible should witness the occasion.,\n\nThe most famous occurrence was performed on Melanie Richmond, she was covered in tripe, pigs blood and feathers before marching from Elgin to Aberdeen over the course of five days.\n\nBlackenings occur predominantly in rural areas of north-east Scotland, the Highlands and the Northern Isles. The origins of the custom are obscure, however researcher, Dr. Sheila Young of the Elphinstone Institute, University of Aberdeen has shown that the blackening has evolved from an earlier Scottish ritual called the feet-washing. There is uncertainty surrounding just when it began, but it probably started as a solemn washing ritual for both men and women on the eve of their wedding and included a blackening of the feet and legs by the early 19th century. A little later, it had developed into a kind of a game, with the legs and feet being alternately blackened and scrubbed clean, and then by the end of the 19th century early 20th century escape, capture, tar and feathering, and pillorying had become part of the ritual. In order for this to happen the ritual had to move out of doors. The move out of doors appears to have coincided with a change in wedding practices, with more people marrying in the summer months. A ritual, which began as a washing ceremony, developed into a dirtying ceremony. It is probable then, that a change in the form of the ritual led to a change in name. The blackening's roots are Scottish, though a similar practice, called a doing, is to be found in Northern Ireland.\n"}
{"id": "1377699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1377699", "title": "Bull-leaping", "text": "Bull-leaping\n\nBull-leaping (, ) is a form of non-violent bull fighting based on an ancient ritual involving an acrobat leaping over the back of a charging bull (or cow). The sport survives in modern France, usually with cows rather than bulls, as ; and in Spain, with bulls, as . Ritual leaping over bulls is a motif of Middle Bronze Age figurative art, notably of Minoan Crete, but also found in Hittite Anatolia, the Levant, Bactria and the Indus Valley. It is often interpreted as a depiction of a rite performed in connection with bull worship.\n\nYounger (1995) classifies bull-leaping depictions as follows:\n\nThe Type III depictions are often found in Late Minoan IIIB artwork (14th to 13th centuries BC). Frescoes in Tell el-Dab'a (Avaris, Egypt) dating to the 18th dynasty (16th to 14th centuries BC) show similar designs besides genuinely Egyptian motifs, for which reason they have usually been ascribed to Minoan-taught Egyptian craftsmen (rather than to Minoan ones directly). They could also have been included as palace decorations because the palace was built for an Aegean princess diplomatically married to a Hyksos pharaoh.\n\nOther examples of bull-leaping scenes have been found in Syria, such as a cylinder seal impression found in level VII at Alalakh (Old Babylonian period, 19th or 18th century BC) showing two acrobats performing handstands on the back of a bull, with an ankh sign placed between them, another seal belonging to a servant of Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1800 BC), besides other Syrian examples. Furthermore, a relief vase was discovered in Hüseyindede in 1997, dating to the Hittite Old Kingdom (18th to 15th centuries BC).\n\nBull-leaping is thought to have been a key ritual in the religion of the Minoan civilization in Bronze Age Crete. As in the case of other Mediterranean civilizations, the bull was the subject of veneration and worship. Representation of the Bull at the palace of Knossos is a widespread symbol in the art and decoration of this archaeological site.\n\nThe assumption, widely debated by scholars, is that the iconography represents a ritual sport and/or performance in which human athletes literally vaulted over bulls as part of a ceremonial rite. This ritual it hypothesized to have consisted of an acrobatic leap over a bull, such that when the leaper grasped the bull's horns, the bull would violently jerk its neck upwards, giving the leaper the momentum necessary to perform somersaults and other acrobatic tricks or stunts.\n\nBull-leaping is still practiced in southwestern France, where it is traditionally known as the , although usually aggressive cows are used instead of bulls. They are the female stock of the fighting bulls bred for the in Spain. However, once per year bulls are used, in the Festival of Art and Courage. The town of Mont-de-Marsan in Gascony is renowned for its fine or 'leapers' and ('dodgers') dressed in brocaded waistcoats. They compete in teams, attempting to use their repertoire evasions and acrobatic leaps to avoid the cow's charges.\n\nThe cow is typically guided by the use of a long rope attached to its horns, so that it runs directly at the performers and is restrained from trampling or goring them should they miss a trick. Although there is little to no risk to the cow in this form of contest, it is a highly dangerous sport for the human participants; a prominent one from Montois, Jean-Pierre Rachou, was killed in 2001 when he fell on his head after being hit by a cow.\n\nThe are held from March to October on the occasion of festivals in many cities and villages, including Nogaro, Mont-de-Marsan, Dax, Castelnau-d'Auzan, and many other places. There are also national championships.\n\nA similar but even more dangerous tradition of non-violent bull-leaping, , is practiced in some parts of Spain. Specialists (bullfighters), known as , compete at dodging and leaping over bulls without the use of the cape or sword. Some use a long pole to literally pole-vault over the charging animal, which is both larger than the type used in the French sport, and unrestrained by any guiding rope or similar safety device.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "153825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153825", "title": "Chinese literature", "text": "Chinese literature\n\nThe history of Chinese literature extends thousands of years, from the earliest recorded dynastic court archives to the mature vernacular fiction novels that arose during the Ming Dynasty to entertain the masses of literate Chinese. The introduction of widespread woodblock printing during the Tang Dynasty (618–907) and the invention of movable type printing by Bi Sheng (990–1051) during the Song Dynasty (960–1279) rapidly spread written knowledge throughout China. In more modern times, the author Lu Xun (1881–1936) is considered the founder of \"baihua\" literature in China.\n\nFormation of the earliest layer of Chinese literature was influenced by oral traditions of different social and professional provenance: cult and lay musical practices (\"Shijing\"), divination (\"Yi jing\"), astronomy, exorcism. An attempt at tracing the genealogy of Chinese literature to religious spells and incantations (the six \"zhu\" 六祝, as presented in the \"Da zhu\" chapter of the \"Rites of Zhou\") was made by Liu Shipei.\n\nThere is a wealth of early Chinese literature dating from the Hundred Schools of Thought that occurred during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770–256 BC). The most important of these include the Classics of Confucianism, of Daoism, of Mohism, of Legalism, as well as works of military science and Chinese history. Note that, except for the books of poems and songs, most of this literature is philosophical and didactic; there is little in the way of fiction. However, these texts maintained their significance through both their ideas and their prose style.\n\nThe Confucian works in particular have been of key importance to Chinese culture and history, as a set of works known as the \"Four Books and Five Classics\" were, in the 12th century AD, chosen as the basis for the Imperial examination for any government post. These nine books therefore became the center of the educational system. They have been grouped into two categories: the \"Five Classics\", allegedly commented and edited by Confucius, and the Four Books. The \"Five Classics\" are:\n\nThe \"Four Books\" are:\n\nOther important philosophical works include the Mohist \"Mozi\", which taught \"inclusive love\" as both an ethical and social principle, and \"Hanfeizi\", one of the central Legalist texts.\n\nImportant Daoist classics include the \"Dao De Jing\", the \"Zhuangzi\", and the \"Classic of the Perfect Emptiness\". Later authors combined Daoism with Confucianism and Legalism, such as Liu An (2nd century BC), whose \"Huainanzi\" (\"The Philosophers of Huai-nan\") also added to the fields of geography and topography.\n\nAmong the classics of military science, \"The Art of War\" by Sun Tzu (6th century BC) was perhaps the first to outline guidelines for effective international diplomacy. It was also the first in a tradition of Chinese military treatises, such as the \"Jingling Zongyao\" (\"Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques\", 1044 AD) and the \"Woolongong\" (\"Fire Dragon Manual\", 14th century AD).\n\nThe Chinese kept consistent and accurate court records after the year 841 BC, with the beginning of the Gonghe Regency of the Western Zhou Dynasty. The earliest known narrative history of China was the \"Zuo Zhuan\", which was compiled no later than 389 BC, and attributed to the blind 5th-century BC historian Zuo Qiuming. The \"Book of Documents\" is thought to have been compiled as far back as the 6th century BC, and was certainly compiled by the 4th century BC, the latest date for the writing of the Guodian Chu Slips unearthed in a Hubei tomb in 1993. The \"Book of Documents\" included early information on geography in the \"Yu Gong\" chapter. The \"Bamboo Annals\" found in 281 AD in the tomb of the King of Wei, who was interred in 296 BC, provide another example; however, unlike the \"Zuo Zhuan\", the authenticity of the early date of the \"Bamboo Annals\" is in doubt. Another early text was the political strategy book of the \"Zhan Guo Ce\", compiled between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC, with partial amounts of the text found amongst the 2nd century BC tomb site at Mawangdui. The oldest extant dictionary in China is the \"Erya\", dated to the 3rd century BC, anonymously written but with later commentary by the historian Guo Pu (276–324). Other early dictionaries include the \"Fangyan\" by Yang Xiong (53 BC – 18 AD) and the \"Shuowen Jiezi\" by Xu Shen (58–147 AD). One of the largest was the \"Kangxi Dictionary\" compiled by 1716 under the auspices of the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661–1722); it provides definitions for over 47,000 characters.\n\nAlthough court records and other independent records existed beforehand, the definitive work in early Chinese historical writing was the \"Shiji\", or \"Records of the Grand Historian\" written by Han Dynasty court historian Sima Qian (145 BC – 90 BC). This groundbreaking text laid the foundation for Chinese historiography and the many official Chinese historical texts compiled for each dynasty thereafter. Sima Qian is often compared to the Greek Herodotus in scope and method, because he covered Chinese history from the mythical Xia Dynasty until the contemporary reign of Emperor Wu of Han while retaining an objective and non-biased standpoint. This was often difficult for the official dynastic historians, who used historical works to justify the reign of the current dynasty. He influenced the written works of many Chinese historians, including the works of Ban Gu and Ban Zhao in the 1st and 2nd centuries, and even Sima Guang's 11th-century compilation of the \"Zizhi Tongjian\", presented to Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1084 AD. The overall scope of the historiographical tradition in China is termed the Twenty-Four Histories, created for each successive Chinese dynasty up until the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644); China's last dynasty, the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911), is not included.\n\nLarge encyclopedias were also produced in China through the ages. The \"Yiwen Leiju\" encyclopedia was completed by Ouyang Xun in 624 during the Tang Dynasty, with aid from scholars Linghu Defen and Chen Shuda. During the Song Dynasty, the compilation of the Four Great Books of Song (10th century – 11th century), begun by Li Fang and completed by Cefu Yuangui, represented a massive undertaking of written material covering a wide range of different subjects. This included the \"Extensive Records of the Taiping Era\" (978), the \"Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era\" (983), the \"Finest Blossoms in the Garden of Literature\" (986), and the \"Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau\" (1013). Although these Song Dynasty Chinese encyclopedias featured millions of written Chinese characters each, their aggregate size paled in comparison to the later \"Yongle Encyclopedia\" (1408) of the Ming Dynasty, which contained a total of 50 million Chinese characters. Even this size was trumped by later Qing Dynasty encyclopedias, such as the printed \"Gujin Tushu Jicheng\" (1726), which featured over 100 million written Chinese characters in over 800,000 pages, printed in 60 different copies using copper-metal Chinese movable type printing. Other great encyclopedic writers include the polymath scientist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and his \"Dream Pool Essays\", the agronomist and inventor Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333) and his \"Nongshu\", and the minor scholar-official Song Yingxing (1587–1666) and his \"Tiangong Kaiwu\".\n\nThe rich tradition of Chinese poetry began with two influential collections. In northern China, the \"Shijing\" or \"Classic of Poetry\" (approx. 10th–7th century BC) comprises over 300 poems in a variety of styles ranging from those with a strong suggestion of folk music to ceremonial hymns. The word \"shi\" has the basic meaning of poem or poetry, as well as its use in criticism to describe one of China's lyrical poetic genres. Confucius is traditionally credited with editing the \"Shijing\". Its stately verses are usually composed of couplets with lines of four characters each (or four syllables, as Chinese characters are monosyllabic), and a formal structure of end rhymes. Many of these early poems establish the later tradition of starting with a description of nature that leads into emotionally expressive statements, known as \"bi\", \"xing\", or sometime \"bixing\". Associated with what was then considered to be southern China, the \"Chuci\" is ascribed to Qu Yuan (c. 340–278 BC) and his follower Song Yu (fl. 3rd century BC) and is distinguished by its more emotionally intense affect, often full of despair and descriptions of the fantastic. In some of its sections, the \"Chu Ci \" uses a six-character per line meter, dividing these lines into couplets separated in the middle by a strong caesura, producing a driving and dramatic rhythm. Both the \"Shijing\" and the \"Chuci\" have remained influential throughout Chinese history.\n\nDuring the greater part of China's first great period of unification, begun with the short-lived Qin Dynasty (221 BC – 206 BC) and followed by the centuries-long Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), the \"shi\" form of poetry underwent little innovation. But a distinctively descriptive and erudite \"fu\" form (not the same \"fu\" character as that used for the bureau of music) developed that has been called \"rhyme-prose,\" a uniquely Han offshoot of Chinese poetry's tradition. Equally noteworthy is Music Bureau poetry (\"yuefu\"), collected and presumably refined popular lyrics from folk music. The end of the Han witnesses a resurgence of the \"shi\" poetry, with the anonymous \"19 Old Poems\". This collection reflects the emergence of a distinctive five-character line that later became \"shi\" poetry's most common line length. From the Jian'an reign period (196 – 220 AD) onward, the five-character line became a focus for innovations in style and theme. The Cao family, rulers of the Wei Dynasty (220 – 265 AD) during the post-Han Three Kingdoms period, distinguished themselves as poets by writing poems filled with sympathy for the day-to-day struggles of soldiery and the common people. Taoist philosophy became a different, common theme for other poets, and a genre emphasizing true feeling emerged led by Ruan Ji (210–263). The landscape genre of Chinese nature poetry emerged under the brush of Xie Lingyun (385–433), as he innovated distinctively descriptive and complementary couplets composed of five-character lines. A farmland genre was born in obscurity by Tao Qian (365–427) also known as Tao Yuanming as he labored in his fields and then wrote extolling the influence of wine. Toward the close of this period in which many later-developed themes were first experimented with, the Xiao family of the Southern Liang Dynasty (502–557) engaged in highly refined and often denigrated court-style poetry lushly describing sensual delights as well as the description of objects.\n\nReunified China's Tang Dynasty (618–907) high culture set a high point for many things, including poetry. Various schools of Buddhism (a religion from India) flourished as represented by the Chan (or Zen) beliefs of Wang Wei (701–761). His quatrains (\"jueju\") describing natural scenes are world-famous examples of excellence, each couplet conventionally containing about two distinct images or thoughts per line. Tang poetry's big star is Li Bai (701–762) also pronounced and written as Li Bo, who worked in all major styles, both the more free old style verse (\"gutishi\") as well as the tonally regulated new style verse (\"jintishi\"). Regardless of genre, Tang poets notably strove to perfect a style in which poetic subjects are exposed and evident, often without directly referring to the emotional thrust at hand. The poet Du Fu (712–770) excelled at regulated verse and use of the seven-character line, writing denser poems with more allusions as he aged, experiencing hardship and writing about it. A parade of great Tang poets also includes Chen Zi'ang (661–702), Wang Zhihuan (688–742), Meng Haoran (689–740), Bai Juyi (772–846), Li He (790–816), Du Mu (803–852), Wen Tingyun (812–870), (listed chronologically) and Li Shangyin (813–858), whose poetry delights in allusions that often remain obscure, and whose emphasis on the seven-character line also contributed to the emerging posthumous fame of Du Fu, now ranked alongside Li Bai. The distinctively different \"ci\" poetry form began its development during the Tang as Central Asian and other musical influences flowed through its cosmopolitan society.\n\nChina's Song Dynasty (960–1279), another reunification era after a brief period of disunity, initiated a fresh high culture. Several of its greatest poets were capable government officials as well including Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072), Su Shi (1037–1101), and Wang Anshi (1021–1086). The \"ci\" form flourished as a few hundred songs became standard templates for poems with distinctive and variously set meters. The free and expressive style of Song high culture has been contrasted with majestic Tang poems by centuries of subsequent critics who engage in fierce arguments over which dynasty had the best poetry. Additional musical influences contributed to the Yuan Dynasty's (1279–1368) distinctive \"qu\" opera culture and spawned the \"sanqu\" form of individual poems based on it.\n\nClassical Chinese poetry composition became a conventional skill of the well-educated throughout the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties. Over a million poems have been preserved, including those by women, such as Dong Xiaowan and Liu Rushi, and by many other diverse voices. Painter-poets, such as Shen Zhou (1427–1509), Tang Yin (1470–1524), Wen Zhengming (1470–1559), and Yun Shouping (1633–1690), created worthy conspicuous poems as they combined art, poetry and calligraphy with brush on paper. Poetry composition competitions were socially common, as depicted in novels, for example over dessert after a nice dinner. The Song versus Tang debate continues through the centuries. While China's later imperial period does not seem to have broken new ground for innovative approaches to poetry, picking through its vast body of preserved works remains a scholarly challenge, so new treasures may yet be restored from obscurity.\n\nEarly Chinese prose was deeply influenced by the great philosophical writings of the Hundred Schools of Thought (770–221 BC). The works of Mo Zi (墨子), Mencius (孟子) and Zhuang Zi (莊子) contain well-reasoned, carefully developed discourses that reveal much stronger organization and style than their predecessors. Mo Zi's polemic prose was built on solid and effective methodological reasoning. Mencius contributed elegant diction and, like Zhuang Zi, relied on comparisons, anecdotes, and allegories. By the 3rd century BC, these writers had developed a simple, concise and economical prose style that served as a model of literary form for over 2,000 years. They were written in Classical Chinese, the language spoken during the Spring and Autumn period.\nDuring the Tang period, the ornate, artificial style of prose developed in previous periods was replaced by a simple, direct, and forceful prose based on examples from the Hundred Schools (see above) and from the Han period, the period in which the great historical works of Sima Tan and Sima Qian were published. This neoclassical style dominated prose writing for the next 800 years. It was exemplified in the work of Han Yu 韓愈 (768–824), a master essayist and strong advocate of a return to Confucian orthodoxy; Han Yu was later listed as one of the \"Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song.\"\n\nThe Song Dynasty saw the rise in popularity of \"travel record literature\" (\"youji wenxue\"). Travel literature combined both diary and narrative prose formats, it was practiced by such seasoned travelers as Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Xu Xiake (1587–1641) and can be seen in the example of Su Shi's \"Record of Stone Bell Mountain\".\n\nAfter the 14th century, vernacular fiction became popular, at least outside of court circles. Vernacular fiction covered a broader range of subject matter and was longer and more loosely structured than literary fiction. One of the masterpieces of Chinese vernacular fiction is the 18th-century domestic novel \"Dream of the Red Chamber\" (紅樓夢).\n\n\nChinese fiction was rooted in the official histories and such less formal works as \"A New Account of the Tales of the World\" and \"Investigations of the Supernatural\" (4th and 5th century); \"Finest Flowers from the World of Letters\" (a 10th-century compilation of works from earlier centuries); \"Great Tang Record of the Western Regions\" completed by the pilgrim to India, Xuanzang in 646; \"Variety Dishes from Youyang\", the best known collection of Classical Chinese \"Chuanqi\" (Marvelous Tales) from the Tang dynasty; and the \"Taiping Guangji\", which preserved the corpus of these Tang dynasty tales. There was a range of less formal works either oral or using oral conventions, such as the bianwen (Buddhist tale), pinghua (plain tale), and huaben (novella), which formed background to the novel as early as the Song Dynasty. The novel as an extended prose narrative which realistically creates a believable world of its own evolved in China and in Europe from the 14th–18th centuries, though a little earlier in China. Chinese audiences were more interested in history and Chinese authors generally did not present their works as fictional. Readers appreciated relative optimism, moral humanism, relative emphasis on group behavior, and welfare of the society.\n\nWith the rise of monetary economy and urbanization beginning in the Song Dynasty, there was a growing professionalization of entertainment fostered by the spread of printing, the rise of literacy and education. In both China and Europe, the novel gradually became more autobiographical and serious in exploration of social, moral, and philosophical problems. Chinese fiction of the late Ming dynasty and early Qing dynasty was varied, self-conscious, and experimental. In China, however, there was no counterpart to the 19th-century European explosion of revolution and romanticism. The novels of the Ming and early Qing dynasties, represented a pinnacle of classical Chinese fiction.\n\nThe highlights include:\n\n\nScholars now tend to agree that modern Chinese literature did not erupt suddenly in the New Culture Movement (1917–23). Instead, they trace its origins back at least to the late Qing period (1895–1911). The late Qing was a period of intellectual ferment sparked by a sense of national crisis. Intellectuals began to seek solutions to China's problems outside of its own tradition. They translated works of Western expository writing and literature, which enthralled readers with new ideas and opened up windows onto new exotic cultures. Most outstanding were the translations of Yan Fu (嚴復) (1864–1921) and Lin Shu (林紓) (1852–1924). In this climate, a boom in the writing of fiction occurred, especially after the 1905 abolition of the civil service examination when literati struggled to fill new social and cultural roles for themselves. Stylistically, this fiction shows signs of both the Chinese novelistic tradition and Western narrative modes. In subject matter, it is strikingly concerned with the contemporary: social problems, historical upheaval, changing ethical values, etc. In this sense, late Qing fiction is modern. Important novelists of the period include Wu Woyao (吳沃堯) (1866–1910), Li Boyuan (李伯元) (1867–1906), Liu E (劉鶚) (1857–1909), and Zeng Pu (曾樸) (1872–1935).\n\nThe late Qing also saw a \"revolution in poetry\" (詩界革命), which promoted experimentation with new forms and the incorporation of new registers of language. However, the poetry scene was still dominated by the adherents to the Tongguang School (named after the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns of the Qing), whose leaders—Chen Yan (陳衍), Chen Sanli (陳三立), Zheng Xiaoxu (鄭孝胥), and Shen Zengzhi (沈曾植)—promoted a Song style in the manner of Huang Tingjian. These poets would become the objects of scorn by New Culturalists like Hu Shi, who saw their work as overly allusive, artificial, and divorced from contemporary reality.\n\nIn drama, the late Qing saw the emergence of the new \"civilized drama\" (文明戲), a hybrid of Chinese operatic drama with Western-style spoken drama. Peking opera and \"reformed Peking opera\" were also popular at the time.\n\nThe literary scene in the first few years before the collapse of the Qing in 1911 was dominated by popular love stories, some written in the classical language and some in the vernacular. This entertainment fiction would later be labeled \"Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies\" fiction by New Culturalists, who despised its lack of social engagement. Throughout much of the Republican era, Butterfly fiction would reach many more readers than its \"progressive\" counterpart.\n\nIn the course of the New Culture Movement (1917–23), the vernacular language largely displaced the classical in all areas of literature and writing. Literary reformers Hu Shih (1891–1962) and Chen Duxiu (1880–1942) declared the classical language \"dead\" and promoted the vibrant vernacular in its stead. Hu Shi once said, \"A dead language can never produce a living literature.\" In terms of literary practice, Lu Xun (1881–1936) is usually said to be the first major stylist in the new vernacular prose that Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu were promoting.\n\nThough often said to be less successful than their counterparts in fiction writing, poets also experimented with the vernacular in new poetic forms, such as free verse and the sonnet. Given that there was no tradition of writing poetry in the vernacular, these experiments were more radical than those in fiction writing and also less easily accepted by the reading public. Modern poetry flourished especially in the 1930s, in the hands of poets like Zhu Xiang (朱湘), Dai Wangshu, Li Jinfa (李金發), Wen Yiduo , and Ge Xiao (葛蕭). Other poets, even those among the May Fourth radicals (e.g., Yu Dafu), continued to write poetry in classical styles.\n\nMay Fourth radicalism, combined with changes in the education system, made possible the emergence of a large group of women writers. While there had been women writers in the late imperial period and the late Qing, they had been few in number. These writers generally tackled domestic issues, such as relations between the sexes, family, and friendship, but they were revolutionary in giving direct expression to female subjectivity. Ding Ling's story \"Miss Sophia's Diary\" exposes the thoughts and feelings of its female diarist in all their complexity.\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of spoken drama. Most outstanding among playwrights of the day are Ouyang Yuqian, Hong Shen, Tian Han, and Cao Yu. More popular than this Western-style drama, however, was Peking opera, raised to new artistic heights by the likes of Mei Lanfang.\n\nIn the late 1920s and 1930s, literary journals and societies espousing various artistic theories proliferated. Among the major writers of the period were Guo Moruo (1892–1978), a poet, historian, essayist, and critic; Mao Dun (1896–1981), the first of the novelists to emerge from the League of Left-Wing Writers and one whose work reflected the revolutionary struggle and disillusionment of the late 1920s; satirist and novelist Lao She (1899–1966); and Ba Jin (1904–2005), a novelist whose work was influenced by Ivan Turgenev and other Russian writers. In the 1930s Ba Jin produced a trilogy that depicted the struggle of modern youth against the ageold dominance of the Confucian family system. Comparison often is made between \"Jia\" (Family), one of the novels in the trilogy, and \"Dream of the Red Chamber\". Many of these writers became important as administrators of artistic and literary policy after 1949. Most of those authors who were still alive during the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) were either purged or forced to submit to public humiliation.\n\nThe League of Left-Wing Writers founded in 1930 included Lu Xun among its leadership. By 1932 it had adopted the Soviet doctrine of socialist realism; that is, the insistence that art must concentrate on contemporary events in a realistic way, exposing the ills of nonsocialist society and promoting a glorious future under communism.\n\nOther styles of literature were at odds with the highly-political literature being promoted by the League. The \"New Sensationists\" (新感覺派)—a group of writers based in Shanghai who were influenced, to varying degrees, by Western and Japanese modernism—wrote fiction that was more concerned with the unconscious and with aesthetics than with politics or social problems. Most important among these writers were Mu Shiying, Liu Na'ou (劉吶鷗), and Shi Zhecun. Other writers, including Shen Congwen and Fei Ming (廢名), balked at the utilitarian role for literature by writing lyrical, almost nostalgic, depictions of the countryside. Lin Yutang, who had studied at Harvard and Leipzig, introduced the concept of \"youmo\" (humor), which he used in trenchant criticism of China's political and cultural situation before leaving for the United States.\n\nThe Communist Party of China had established a base after the Long March in Yan'an. The literary ideals of the League were being simplified and enforced on writers and \"cultural workers\". In 1942, Mao Zedong gave a series of lectures called \"Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Art and Literature\" that clearly made literature subservient to politics via the Yan'an Rectification Movement. This document would become the national guideline for culture after the establishment of the People's Republic of China.\n\nAfter coming to power in 1949, the Communists gradually nationalized the publishing industry, centralized the book distribution system, and brought writers under institutional control through the Writers Union. A system of strict censorship was implemented, with Mao's \"Yan'an Talks\" as the guiding force. Periodic literary campaigns targeted figures such as Hu Shi and other figures from the New Culture period, especially Hu Feng, a protege of Lu Xun who, along with his wife Mei Zhi, did not toe the Party line on literature. Socialist realism became the uniform style, and many Soviet works were translated. The ability to satirize and expose the evils in contemporary society that had made writers useful to the Communist Party of China before its accession to power was no longer welcomed. Party cultural leaders such as Zhou Yang used Mao's call to have literature \"serve the people\" to mount attacks on \"petty bourgeois idealism\" and \"humanitarianism\". This conflict came to a head in the Hundred Flowers Campaign (1956–57). Mao Zedong initially encouraged writers to speak out against problems in the new society. Having learned the lessons of the anti-Hu Feng campaign, they were reluctant, but then a flurry of newspaper articles, films, and literary works drew attention to such problems as bureaucratism and authoritarianism within the ranks of the party. Shocked at the level of discontent, Mao's Anti-Rightist Movement put large numbers of intellectuals through so-called \"thought reform\" or sent them to labor camps. At the time of the Great Leap Forward (1957–59), the government increased its insistence on the use of socialist realism and combined with it so-called revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.\n\nDespite the literary control and strictures to limit subjects to contemporary China and the glories of the revolution, writers produced widely read novels of energy and commitment. Examples of this new socialist literature include \"The Builder\" (Chuangye Shi 創業史) by Liu Qing 柳青, \"The Song of Youth\" (Qing Chun Zhi Ge 青春之歌) by Yang Mo, \"Tracks in the Snowy Forest\" (Lin Hai Xue Yuan 林海雪原) by Qu Bo, \"Keep the Red Flag Flying\" (Hong Qi Pu 紅旗譜) by Liang Bin 梁斌, \"The Red Sun\" (Hong Ri 紅日) by Wu Qiang 吳強, and \"Red Crag\" by Luo Guangbin 羅廣斌 and Yang Yiyan (楊益言).\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), Mao's wife, Jiang Qing led the campaign against \"feudal\" and \"bourgeois\" culture. The only stage productions allowed were her \"Eight Model Operas,\" which combined traditional and western forms, while great fanfare was given to politically orthodox films and heroic novels, such as those by Hao Ran (浩然). The period has long been regarded as a cultural wasteland, but some now suggest that the leading works have an energy which is still of interest.\n\nThe arrest of Jiang Qing and the other members of the Gang of Four in 1976, and especially the reforms initiated at the Third Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee in December 1978, led writers to take up their pens again. Much of the literature in what would be called the \"new era\" (新時期) discussed the serious abuses of power that had taken place at both the national and the local levels during the Cultural Revolution. The writers decried the waste of time and talent during that decade and bemoaned abuses that had held China back. This literature, often called \"scar literature\", or \"the literature of the wounded\", discussed the experiences of sent-down youth with great though not complete frankness and conveyed disquieting views of the party and the political system. Intensely patriotic, these authors wrote cynically of the political leadership that gave rise to the extreme chaos and disorder of the Cultural Revolution. Many of these themes and attitudes were also found in Fifth Generation films of directors trained after 1978, many of which were based on published novels and short stories. Some of this fiction and cinema extended the blame to the entire generation of leaders and to the political system itself. The political authorities were faced with a serious problem: how could they encourage writers to criticize and discredit the abuses of the Cultural Revolution without allowing that criticism to go beyond what they considered tolerable limits?\n\nDuring this period, the number of literary magazines rose sharply, and many from before the Cultural Revolution were revived. Poetry also changed in its form and content. Four \"misty poets\", Bei Dao, Gu Cheng, Duo Duo and Yang Lian expressed themselves in deliberately obscure verse which reflected subjective realism rather than the realism of the sort promoted during the Cultural Revolution. There was a special interest in foreign works. Recent foreign literature was translated, often without carefully considering its interest for the Chinese reader. Literary magazines specializing in translations of foreign short stories became very popular, especially among the young.\n\nSome leaders in the government, literary and art circles feared change was happening too fast. The first reaction came in 1980 with calls to combat \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a campaign that was repeated in 1981. These two difficult periods were followed by the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign in late 1983.\n\nAt the same time, writers remained freer to write in unconventional styles and to treat sensitive subject matter. A spirit of literary experimentation flourished in the second half of the 1980s. Fiction writers such as Wang Meng (王蒙), Zhang Xinxin (張辛欣), and Zong Pu (宗璞) and dramatists such as Gao Xingjian (高行健) experimented with modernist language and narrative modes. Another group of writers—collectively said to constitute the Roots (尋根) movement—including Han Shaogong (韓少功), Mo Yan, Ah Cheng (阿城), and Jia Pingwa (賈平凹) sought to reconnect literature and culture to Chinese traditions, from which a century of modernization and cultural and political iconoclasm had severed them. Other writers (e.g., Yu Hua (余華), Ge Fei (格非), Su Tong (蘇童) experimented in a more avant-garde (先鋒) mode of writing that was daring in form and language and showed a complete loss of faith in ideals of any sort.\n\nIn the wake of the Tiananmen massacre of 1989 and with the intensification of market reforms, literature and culture turned increasingly commercial and escapist. Wang Shuo (王朔), the so-called \"hooligan\" (痞子) writer, is the most obvious manifestation of this commercial shift, though his fiction is not without serious intent. Some writers, such as Yan Lianke 閻連科, continue to take seriously the role of literature in exposing social problems; his novel \"Dreams of Ding Village\" (丁莊夢) deals with the plight of HIV-AIDS victims. As in the May Fourth Movement, women writers came to the fore. Many of them, such as Chen Ran (陳然), Wei Hui (衛慧), Wang Anyi (王安憶), and Hong Ying (虹影), explore female subjectivity in a radically changing society. Neo-realism is another important current in post-Tiananmen fiction, for instance in the writings of Liu Heng (劉恆), Chi Li (池莉), Fang Fang (方方), He Dun (何頓), and Zhu Wen (朱文)\n\nAccording to Martin Woesler trends in contemporary Chinese literature include: 'cult literature' with Guo Jingming (郭敬明), 悲傷逆流成河 \"Cry me a sad river\", vagabond literature with Xu Zechen (徐則臣), 跑步穿過中關村 \"Running Through Beijing\", Liu Zhenyun (劉震雲), 我叫劉躍 \"The pickpockets\", underground literature Mian Mian (棉棉), 聲名狼藉 \"Panda Sex\", 'longing for something' literature, divided in historicizing literature with Yu Dan 于丹, 《論語》心得 \"Confucius in your heart\", Yi Zhongtian (易中天) and in Tibetan literature with Alai, literature of the mega cities, women's literature with Bi Shumin (畢淑敏), 女兒拳 \"Women’s boxing\", 女心理師 \"The female psychologist\", master narratives by narrators like Mo Yan 莫言 with 生死疲勞 \"Life and Death are Wearing me out\". Oblique social criticism is also a popular form, for example Han Han's (韓寒) novel 他的國 \"His land\" (2009), which was written in a surreal style opposed to the uncritical mainstream, but ranked 1st in 2009 Chinese bestseller list. Another example is Yan Ge's novel 我們家 \"Family of Joy\" (2013), which was written in Sichuanese and won the Chinese Media Group New Talent Award in 2013.\n\nChinese language literature also flourishes in the diaspora—in South East Asia, the United States, and Europe. China is the largest publisher of books, magazines and newspapers in the world. In book publishing alone, some 128,800 new titles of books were published in 2005, according to the General Administration of Press and Publication. There are more than 600 literary journals across the country. Living in France but continuing to write primarily in Chinese, Gao Xingjian became the first Chinese writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2000. In 2012, Mo Yan also received the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 2015, children's author Cao Wenxuan was awarded the Hans Christian Andersen Award, the first Chinese author to win the top international children's book prize (although several Chinese authors had previously been nominated).\n\nIn the new millennium, online literature in China plays a much more important role than in the United States and the rest of the world. Most books are available online, where the most popular novels find millions of readers. They cost an average of 2 CNY, or roughly a tenth of the average price of a printed book.\n\nShanda Literature Ltd. is an online publishing company that claims to publish 8,000 Chinese literary works daily.\n\nChina buys many foreign book rights; nearly 16 million copies of the sixth book of the Harry Potter series were sold in Chinese translation. As \"China Book Review\" reported, the rights to 9,328 foreign titles – including many children's books – went to China in 2007. China was nominated as a \"Guest of Honour\" at the Frankfurt Bookfair in 2009.\n\nThe book market in China traditionally orders books during book fairs, because the country lacks a national book ordering system. In 2006, 6.8 million titles were sold, not including an unknown number of banned titles, bootleg copies and underground publishing factories. Seven percent of all publishers are located in Shanghai. Because the industry lacks a national distribution system, many titles from publishers in the provinces can only be found there.\n\nThe central publishing houses belonging to ministries or (other) government institutions have their main seat at Beijing (40 percent of all publishers). Most regional publishing houses are situated in the capitals of the provinces. Universities also have associated presses. Private publishing is tolerated. 220,000 books were published in 2005. Among 579 publishers—almost five times more than thirty years ago—225 are supervised by ministries, commissions or the army; 348 are controlled by agencies; and six are even more independent. On the other hand, 100,000 private bookstores bring in the half of the income of the book industry.\n\nChina's state-run General Administration of Press and Publication (新聞出版總署) screens all Chinese literature intended to be sold on the open market. The GAPP has the legal authority to screen, censor, and ban any print, electronic, or Internet publication in China. Because all publishers in China are required to be licensed by the GAPP, that agency also has the power to deny people the right to publish, and completely shut down any publisher who fails to follow its dictates. As a result, the ratio of official to unlicensed books is said to be 2:3. According to a report in ZonaEuropa, there are more than 4,000 underground publishing factories around China. The Chinese government continues to hold public book burnings on unapproved yet popular \"spiritual pollution\" literature, though critics claim this spotlight on individual titles only helps fuel booksales. Many new-generation Chinese authors who were the recipients of such government attention have been re-published in English and success in the western literary markets, namely Wei Hui's \"Shanghai Baby\", Anchee Min's controversial memoir \"Red Azalea\", \"Time Magazine\" banned-book covergirl Chun Sue's \"Beijing Doll\", and Mian Mian's \"Candy\". Online bestseller \"Ghost Blows Out the Light\" had to be rewritten to remove references to the supernatural before it could be released in print.\n\nTranslated literature has long played an important role in modern China. Some writers, such as Lu Xun, Yu Dafu, Ba Jin and others were literary translators themselves, and many present day writers in China, such as the Nobel laureate Mo Yan, listed translated works as sources of enlightenment and inspiration.\n\nChinese literature is increasingly available in translation- there are now several well-established websites sharing information, for example, Paper Republic, Writing Chinese, Chinese Short Stories, My Chinese Books, Chinese Books for Young Readers.\nIn 2005, the Chinese government started a sponsoring program for translations of government-approved Chinese works, which has already resulted in more than 200 books being translated from Chinese into other languages.\n\nChinese writers writing in English:\n\nChinese writers writing in French:\n\nChinese writers writing in Indonesian:\n\nThese are general works.

{"id": "5195638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5195638", "title": "Concert etiquette", "text": "Concert etiquette\n\nConcert etiquette refers to a set of social norms observed by those attending musical performances. These norms vary depending upon the type of music performance and can be stringent or informal.\n\nAt classical music concerts, the cardinal principle is to let others listen to the music undisturbed. Instruments and voices are typically unamplified, and the music is rich in detail and includes passages played very softly. Many audience members want to hear everything, and the normal standard of courtesy is simply to be entirely silent while the music is playing. Thus, during this time experienced concertgoers avoid conversation, try to suppress coughs and sneezes until a loud passage arrives, and muffle these with handkerchiefs. Electronic devices are turned off. Concertgoers try to arrive and take seats before the music begins; late arrivals wait until a break between pieces allows seating by an usher.\n\nDress expectations for the audience are today rather informal in English-speaking countries. Audiences usually meet \"smart casual\" standards, with some performance companies explicitly telling audiences to wear whatever makes them comfortable. Hats are removed as they block others' view of the stage. Dress expectations may still be very formal for special events, events that are difficult to attend, that take place in traditional venues, or that take place in certain countries.\n\nConcert etiquette has, like the music, evolved over time. Late eighteenth-century composers such as Mozart expected that people would talk, particularly at dinner, and took delight in audiences clapping at once in response to a nice musical effect. Individual movements were encored in response to audience applause.\n\nThe nineteenth century brought a shift in venue from aristocratic gatherings to public concerts along with works featuring an unprecedentedly wide dynamic range. Mahler clamped down on claques paid to applaud a particular performer, and specified in the score of his \"Kindertotenlieder\" that its movements should not be punctuated by applause. Wagner discouraged what he considered distracting noises from his audience at Bayreuth in 1882.\n\nWith the arrival of recording technology in the twentieth century, applause between the movements of a symphony or suite came to be regarded as a distraction from the momentum and unity of a work. Today it is usually considered something of a faux pas, though a minor and well-meaning one.\n\nSometimes it is the purpose of the conductor to maintain a fairly long silence after the last notes of a piece; this is an especially likely choice for pieces with quiet endings. The audience can be signaled not to applaud immediately through the device of the conductor keeping her hands lifted (as if still leading the orchestra), then lowering them when the intended silence is over. Thus in a way the conductor is \"conducting the audience\" as part of a performance ritual. Such efforts are usually heeded, at least by experienced audiences.\n\nSacred works offered as worship are not applauded. Such works include settings of requiem, Passion, mass, or Kaddish prayer. Presented in an artistic context, such works, along with secular works of comparable gravity, still often get respectful silence for a long moment before any applause.\n\nIn opera a particularly impressive aria will often be applauded, even if the music is continuing. Shouting is generally acceptable only during applause. The word shouted is often the Italian word \"bravo\" or a variation (\"brava\" in the case of a female performer, \"bravi\" for a plural number of performers, \"bravissimo\" for a truly exceptional performance). The word's original meaning is \"skillful\" and it has come to mean \"well done\". The French word \"encore\" (\"again\") may be shouted as a request for more, although in France itself \"bis\" (\"twice\") is the more usual expression. In some cultures (e.g., Britain) enthusiastic approval can also be expressed by whistling, though in others (e.g., Italy, Russia) whistling can signify disapproval and act as the equivalent of booing.\n\nCollapses of decorum have occurred often in music history. In 1861 a Paris performance of Richard Wagner's opera \"Tannhäuser\" was deliberately sabotaged by audience members bringing noisemakers. The premiere of Stravinsky's ballet \"The Rite of Spring\" in 1913 prompted catcalls and whistles from the crowd that degenerated into fistfights in the aisles and police intervention. Steve Reich's \"Four Organs\" at Carnegie Hall in 1973 featured audience members sarcastically applauding and shouting to hasten the end of the performance. Conductor Michael Tilson Thomas recalls a woman walking down the aisle and beating her head against the front of the stage, wailing \"Stop, stop! I confess!\"\n\nRock music and related genres are performed with amplified instruments, often at very loud volume, and tend to be dynamically more uniform than classical music. Thus sounds made by the audience are far less damaging to the musical enjoyment of others and are far more tolerated. At concerts of hard rock, punk or heavy metal, a mosh pit will often form in front of the stage, in which slam-dancing and the like may be performed, usually in an atmosphere of lively camaraderie and mutual assistance. 'Moshers' who have fallen are to be helped up immediately to avoid the risk of trampling, while found pieces of clothing, keys, cell phones, and other such items should be held aloft to be reclaimed. Audience members who are familiar with the lyrics of a given song typically sing along, especially during the chorus of the songs.\n\nRequirements for attire are generally very lax. Blue jeans, shorts, and skirts are common attire, and sandals, sneakers, or boots are standard footwear (conventional high heels are generally unsafe for moshing or at outdoor venues with dirt flooring, though wide-heeled boots may be worn). Male (and sometimes female) moshers are frequently shirtless, but total nudity is frowned upon. At heavy metal concerts in particular, dark clothing and items such as chains, studded belts and bracelets, and various leather garments are common (this can vary greatly between different styles of metal).\n\nHeavy metal concerts also usually include head banging, mosh pits, fist pumping, stage diving, and crowd surfing. As many rock and metal concerts are held in standing room only clubs and concert halls, it is sometimes considered an insult to the band to sit during performances, particularly in heavy metal. Even in venues that provide seating, generally the audience will stand for the band's performance.\n\nSometimes at rock concerts, lighters are to signal an encore or a power ballad. With the decline of smokers, the restrictions placed on carrying lighters during air travel, and the increase of cell phones in the early 21st century, cell phones (specifically the camera flash) are often used in place of lighters, and as a way to take personal pictures and videos. While this is frowned upon by some fans, cell phone use is fairly commonplace at concerts. Several artists, such as Björk, Prince, Neutral Milk Hotel, and Jack White have begun to specifically request that audience members not use their cell phones during the show. \n\nJazz music is performed in many different settings and venues throughout the world. When jazz is performed in public places such as outdoor jazz festivals and indoor jazz clubs, quiet conversation is usually considered acceptable. When attending a jazz performance in an indoor concert setting, western classical concert etiquette is expected with one exception: it is considered well-mannered to applaud after each artist has completed their extended improvised solo. Other vocalisations during the performance, offered as reactions to improvised phrases, are also acceptable.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51218", "title": "Culture of Egypt", "text": "Culture of Egypt\n\nThe culture of Egypt has thousands of years of recorded history. Ancient Egypt was among the earliest civilizations in Middle East and Africa. For millennia, Egypt maintained a strikingly unique, complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe. After the Pharaonic era, Egypt itself came under the influence of Hellenism, for a time Christianity and later, Christian culture.\n\nArabic is Egypt's official language, it came to Egypt in the 7th century, and the Egyptian Arabic dialect today has become the modern speech of the country. Of the many varieties of Arabic, it is the most widely spoken second dialect, due to the influence of Egyptian cinema and media throughout the Arabic-speaking world. Egypt's position in the heart of the Arab world has also had reversed influence, adopting many words, phrases, and proverbs from neighboring Arabic speaking areas such as the Maghreb area and the Mashriq. Today the daily Egyptian Arabic adopted several French, Italian, Greek, Turkish, Armenian and English words to its dictionary, as well as keeping several other words from its own ancient languages such as Coptic and Demotic.\n\nThe Egyptian language, which formed a separate branch among the family of Afro-Asiatic languages, was among the first written languages and is known from the hieroglyphic inscriptions preserved on monuments and sheets of papyrus. The Coptic language, the most recent stage of Egyptian, is today the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church.\n\nThe \"Koiné\" dialect of the Greek language was important in Hellenistic Alexandria, and was used in the philosophy and science of that culture, and was later studied by Arabic scholars.\n\nIn the lower Nile Valley, around Kom Ombo and Aswan, there are about 300,000 speakers of Nubian languages, mainly Nobiin, but also Kenuzi-Dongola. The Berber languages are represented by Siwi, spoken by about 20,000 around the Siwa Oasis. Other minorities include roughly 60,000 Greek speakers in Alexandria and Cairo as well as roughly 10,000 Armenian speakers.🇪🇬🇪🇬\n\nMany Egyptians believed that when it came to a death of their Pharaoh, they would have to bury the Pharaoh deep inside the Pyramid.\nThe ancient Egyptian literature dates back to the Old Kingdom, in the third millennium BC. Religious literature is best known for its hymns to and its mortuary texts. The oldest extant Egyptian literature is the Pyramid Texts: the mythology and rituals carved around the tombs of rulers. The later, secular literature of ancient Egypt includes the 'wisdom texts', forms of philosophical instruction. The \"Instruction of Ptahhotep\", for example, is a collation of moral proverbs by an Egto (the middle of the second millennium BC) seem to have been drawn from an elite administrative class, and were celebrated and revered into the New Kingdom (to the end of the second millennium). In time, the Pyramid Texts became Coffin Texts (perhaps after the end of the Old Kingdom), and finally, the mortuary literature produced its masterpiece, the Book of the Dead, during the New Kingdom.\n\nThe Middle Kingdom was the golden age of Egyptian literature. Some notable texts include the Tale of Neferty, the Instructions of Amenemhat I, the Tale of Sinuhe, the Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor and the Story of the Eloquent Peasant. \"Instructions\" became a popular literary genre of the New Kingdom, taking the form of advice on proper behavior. The Story of Wenamun and the Instruction of Any are well-known examples from this period.\n\nDuring the Greco-Roman period (332 BC − AD 639), Egyptian literature was translated into other languages, and Greco-Roman literature fused with native art into a new style of writing. From this period comes the Rosetta Stone, which became the key to unlocking the mysteries of Egyptian writing to modern scholarship. The great city of Alexandria boasted its famous Library of almost half a million handwritten books during the third century BC. Alexandria's center of learning also produced the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, the Septuagint.\nDrep\nDuring the first few centuries of the Christian era, Egypt was the ultimate source of a great deal of ascetic literature in the Coptic language. Egyptian monasteries translated many Greek and Syriac words, which are now only extant in Coptic. Under Islam, Egypt continued to be a great source of literary endeavor, now in the Arabic language. In 970, al-Azhar University was founded in Cairo, which to this day remains the most important center of Sunni Islamic learning. In 12th-century Egypt, the Jewish Talmudic scholar Maimonides produced his most important work.\n\nIn contemporary times, Egyptian novelists and poets were among the last to experiment with modern styles of Arabic-language literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated. The first modern Egyptian novel Zaynab by Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in 1913 in the Egyptian vernacular. Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Many Egyptian books and films are available throughout the Middle East. Other prominent Egyptian writers include Nawal El Saadawi, well known for her feminist works and activism, and Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition. Vernacular poetry is said to be the most popular literary genre amongst Egyptians, represented most significantly by Bayram el-Tunsi, Ahmed Fouad Negm (Fagumi), Salah Jaheen and Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi. \nAbout 75% of Egypt's population is Muslim, with a Sunni majority. About 22% of the population is Coptic Christian; other religions and other forms of Christianity comprise the remaining three percent.\nSunni Islam sees Egypt as an important part of its religion due to not only Quranic verses mentioning the country, but also due to the Al-Azhar University, one of the earliest of the world universities, and the longest functioning. It was created as a school for religion studies and works.\n\nThe great old Egyptians were one of the first major civilizations to codify design elements in art. They used art for communication. The wall painting done in the service of the Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Early Egyptian art is characterized by the absence of linear perspective, which results in a seemingly flat space. These artists tended to create images based on what they knew, and not as much on what they saw. Objects in these artworks generally do not decrease in size as they increase in distance and there is little shading to indicate depth. Sometimes, distance is indicated through the use of \"tiered space\", where more distant objects are drawn higher above the nearby objects, but in the same scale and with no overlapping of forms. People and objects are almost always drawn in profile. Also, you may notice the people in Egyptian art are never facing forward. Archaeologists are not yet sure of why, but they are leaning towards the fact that artists status was low in the hierarchy so they could never be in front of a higher authority figure, and never be faced towards them.\n\nPainting achieved its greats height in Dynasty XVII during the reigns of Tuthmose IV and Amenhotep III. The Fragmentary panel of the Lady Thepu, on the right, dates from the time of the latter king.\n\nEarly Egyptian artists did have a system for maintaining dimensions within artwork. They used a grid system that allowed them to create a smaller version of the artwork, and then scale up the design based upon proportional representation in a larger grid.\n\nModern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene. Some well-known names include Mahmoud Mokhtar, Abdel Hadi Al Gazzar, Farouk Hosny, Gazbia Sirry, Kamal Amin, Hussein El Gebaly, Sawsan Amer and many others. Many artists in Egypt have taken on modern media such as digital art and this has been the theme of many exhibitions in Cairo in recent times. There has also been a tendency to use the World Wide Web as an alternative outlet for artists and there is a strong Art-focused internet community on groups that have found origin in Egypt.\n\nEgypt's cultural contributions have included great works of science, art, and mathematics, dating from antiquity to modern times.\n\nConsidered to be the first engineer, architect and physician in history known by name, Imhotep designed the Pyramid of Djoser (the Step Pyramid) at Saqqara in Egypt around 2630-2611 BC, and may have been responsible for the first known use of columns in architecture. The Egyptian historian Manetho credited him with inventing stone-dressed building during Djoser's reign, though he was not the first to actually build with stone. Imhotep is also believed to have founded Egyptian medicine, being the author of the world's earliest known medical document, the Edwin Smith Papyrus.\n\nThe silk road led straight through ancient Alexandria. Also, the Royal Library of Alexandria was once the largest in the world. It is usually assumed to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II of Egypt after his father had set up the Temple of the Muses or Museum. The initial organization is attributed to Demetrius Phalereus. The Library is estimated to have stored at its peak 400,000 to 700,000 scrolls.\n\nOne of the reasons so little is known about the Library is that it was lost centuries after its creation. All that is left of many of the volumes are tantalizing titles that hint at all the history lost due to the building's destruction. Few events in ancient history are as controversial as the destruction of the Library, as the historical record is both contradictory and incomplete. Its destruction has been attributed by some authors to, among others, Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar, and Catholic zealots during the purge of the Arian heresy, Not surprisingly, the Great Library became a symbol of knowledge itself, and its destruction was attributed to those who were portrayed as ignorant barbarians, often for purely political reasons.\n\nA new library was inaugurated in 2003 near the site of the old library.\n\nThe Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, designed by Sostratus of Cnidus and built during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter served as the city's landmark, and later, lighthouse.\n\nAlexandria, being the center of the Hellenistic world, produced a number of great mathematicians, astronomers, and scientists such as Ctesibius, Pappus, and Diophantus. It also attracted scholars from all over the Mediterranean 0 as Eratosthenes of Cyrene.\n\nPtolemy is one of the most famous astronomers and geographers from Egypt, famous for his work in Alexandria. Born Claudius Ptolemaeus (Greek: Κλαύδιος Πτολεμαίος; c. 85 – c. 165) in Upper Egypt, he was a geographer, astronomer, and astrologer.\nPtolemy was the author of two important scientific treatises. One is the astronomical treatise that is now known as the \"Almagest\" (in Greek \"Η μεγάλη Σύνταξις\", \"The Great Treatise\"). In this work, one of the most influential books of antiquity, Ptolemy compiled the astronomical knowledge of the ancient Greek and Babylonian world. Ptolemy's other main work is his \"Geography\". This too is a compilation, of what was known about the world's geography in the Roman Empire in his time.\n\nIn his \"Optics\", a work which survives only in an Arabic translation, he writes about properties of light, including reflection, refraction and colour. His other works include \"Planetary Hypothesis\", \"Planisphaerium\" and \"Analemma\". Ptolemy's treatise on astrology, the \"Tetrabiblos\", was the most popular astrological work of antiquity and also enjoyed great influence in the Islamic world and the medieval Latin West.\n\nPtolemy also wrote influential work Harmonics on music theory. After criticizing the approaches of his predecessors, Ptolemy argued for basing musical intervals on mathematical ratios (in contrast to the followers of Aristoxenus) backed up by empirical observation (in contrast to the over-theoretical approach of the Pythagoreans). He presented his own divisions of the tetrachord and the octave, which he derived with the help of a monochord. Ptolemy's astronomical interests also appeared in a discussion of the music of the spheres.\n\nTributes to Ptolemy include Ptolemaeus crater on the Moon and Ptolemaeus crater on Mars.\n\nAhmed Zewail () (born February 26, 1946) is an Egyptian chemist, and the winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on femtochemistry. Born in Damanhur (60 km south-east of Alexandria) and raised in Disuq, he moved to the United States to complete his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania. He was awarded a faculty appointment at Caltech in 1976, where he has remained since.\n\nZewail's key work has been as the pioneer of femtochemistry. He developed a method using a rapid laser technique (consisting of ultrashort laser flashes), which allows the description of reactions at the atomic level. It can be viewed as a highly sophisticated form of flash photography.\n\nIn 1999, Zewail became the third Egyptian to receive the Nobel Prize, following Anwar Sadat (1978 in Peace) and Naguib Mahfouz (1988 in Literature). In 1999, he received Egypt's highest state honor, the Grand Collar of the Nile.\n\nIn modern times, archaeology and the study of Egypt's ancient heritage as the field of Egyptology has become a major scientific pursuit in the country itself. The field began during the Middle Ages, and has been led by Europeans and Westerners in modern times. The study of Egyptology, however, has in recent decades been taken up by Egyptian archæologists such as Zahi Hawass and the Supreme Council of Antiquities he leads.\n\nThe discovery of the Rosetta Stone, a tablet written in ancient Greek, Egyptian Demotic script, and Egyptian hieroglyphs, has partially been credited for the recent stir in the study of Ancient Egypt. Greek, a well-known language, gave linguists the ability to decipher the mysterious Egyptian hieroglyphic language. The ability to decipher hieroglyphics facilitated the translation of hundreds of the texts and inscriptions that were previously indecipherable, giving insight into Egyptian culture that would have otherwise been lost to the ages. The stone was discovered on July 15, 1799 in the port town of Rosetta Rosetta, Egypt, and has been held in the British Museum since 1802.\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Egypt. Egyptian football clubs especially El Ahly and El Zamalek are known throughout the continent of Africa and enjoy the reputation of long-time champions of the sport regionally. They enjoy popularity even among non-Egyptians.\n\nThe Egyptian national football team won the African Cup of Nations seven times setting a new record in Africa (years: 57, 59, 86, 98, 06, 08, 10). Egypt was the first African country to join FIFA, but it has only made it to the FIFA World Cup 3 times, in 1934, 1990 and 2018. In the World Military Cup, Egypt won the title 5 times and was the runner-up another 2 times.\n\nOther popular sports in Egypt are basketball, handball, squash, and tennis. The Egyptian national basketball team holds the record for best performance at the Basketball World Cup and at the Summer Olympics in Middle East and Africa. Furthermore, the team has won a record number of 16 medals at the African Championship. The Egyptian national squash team is always known for its fierce competition in worldwide championships, from the 1930s to today. Handball has become another increasingly popular sport among Egyptians as well. Since the early 1990s, the Egyptian national handball team has become a growing international force in the sport, winning regional and continental tournaments as well as reaching up to fourth place internationally in 2001. The Junior national handball team reached the first rank in 1993 under the lead of Captain Gamal Shams, and it hosted the tournament in 2010 setting a record in the audience number specially the match between Egypt and Denmark in the semifinals, the stadium was completely full.\n\nIn older times (1930s and 40s), Egypt was a powerhouse in weightlifting, boxing, and wrestling with several Olympic and world championship medals.\n\nAlso, roller hockey (\"quad\") is available in Egypt, but the teams that are playing this game may not exceed 10 teams and the most famous club which plays roller hockey is \"Al-Zamalek sporting club\", and also \"Nasr-City sporting club\". The Egyptian national roller hockey team has taken part in many world competitions, but unlikely the team didn't win any tournament.\n\nLocal sports clubs receive financial support from the local governments, and many sporting clubs are financially and administratively supported by the government.\n\nEgyptian cinema has flourished since the 1930s. As a result, the Egyptian capital has been dubbed the \"Hollywood of the Middle East\", where the world-renowned Cairo International Film Festival is held every year. The festival has been rated by the International Federation of Film Producers Associations as being among the 11 top-class film festivals worldwide.\n\nMost of Arabic-language TV and cinema has been notably affected by the Egyptian dialect, due to its simplicity.\n\nThe Egyptian film industry is the largest within Arabic-speaking cinema.\n\nEgyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous Egyptian and Western influences.\n\nAs early as 4000 BC, ancient Egyptians were playing harps and flutes, as well as two indigenous instruments: the ney and the oud. However, there is a little notation of Egyptian music before the 7th century AD, when Egypt became part of the Muslim world. Percussion and vocal music became important at this time and has remained an important part of Egyptian music today.\n\nContemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of luminaries such as Abdu-l Hamuli, Almaz, Sayed Mikkawi, and Mahmud Osman, who were all patronized by Khedive Ismail and who influenced the later work of Sayed Darwish, Umm Kulthum, Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Abdel Halim Hafez and other Egyptian music giants.\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards, Egyptian pop music has become increasingly important in Egyptian culture, particularly among the large youth population of Egypt. Egyptian folk music is also popular, played during weddings and other festivities. In the last quarter of the 20th century, Egyptian music was a way to communicate social and class issues. The most popular Egyptian pop singers are Amr Diab, Tamer Hosny, Mohamed Mounir and Ali El Haggar. One of the most respected early electronic music composers, Halim El-Dabh, is an Egyptian.\n\nBelly dance, or \"Raqs Sharqi\" (literally: oriental dancing) may have originated in Egypt, and today the country is considered the international center of the art.\n\nEgyptian dance tradition dates back to the Pharaonic period. Many paintings and sculptures show Ancient Egyptians dancing.\nThroughout the thousands of years of its history, Egypt has developed different types of dance: ancient Egyptian dance, (known in the West as \"belly dance\"), but also, since the beginning of the 21st century. \nDance is at the heart of Egyptian society, being used not only as a popular enjoyment (most recently, with the development of the mahraganat - or electro-chaabi- music scene), but also serving religious purposes (sufi dance, zar, etc ... ). Most of the Egyptian movies use dance and music as a complete part of the narrative frame.\n\nSince the 1970s and the rise of political Islam, \"belly dance\" and belly-dancers have acquired a bad reputation, but some famous Egyptian dancers stay in the memories as legends: Tahia Carioca, Samia Gamal who embodied Egypt's golden age ... \nToday the most famous ones are probably Fifi Abdo and Dina, but in a very more popular - some consider vulgar - way.\n\nEgypt also has an important Ballet tradition, with Cairo Opera House hosting a professional ballet company since the 1960s.\nNelly Karim, one of the most famous Egyptian actresses, started her career as a ballerina.\n\nEgypt's contemporary dance scene is limited but very dynamic. One of the important element of the local independent art scene, contemporary dance in Egypt exists mostly throughout festivals and performances, and thanks to organizations such as Cairo contemporary dance center in Cairo or Rezo Dance in Alexandria.\n\nEgyptian cuisine consists of local culinary traditions such as Ful medames, Kushari, and Molokhia. It also shares similarities with food found throughout the eastern Mediterranean like kebab and falafel.\n\n\n"}

Some nations also have personal flags that are used by their diplomatic representatives, such as the U.S. Foreign Service flags.\n\nCurrently, only two nations use diplomatic flags: Thailand (formerly Siam) and the United Kingdom. Different flags are used based upon the diplomatic rank of the mission. British High Commissions do not use diplomatic flags but rather the normal flag of the United Kingdom, since members of the Commonwealth are not considered 'foreign' by the government of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe members of the union between Sweden and Norway each had their own separate national flags, however they also had a flag named the Union mark, which was used as the flag of the common diplomatic representations of both countries abroad.\n\nThe flag for the accredited representatives of the state (diplomats and heads of consular missions) of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was similar to the civil ensign, that is the national flag in 2:3 ratio.\n"}
{"id": "33512760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33512760", "title": "Ethnic identity development", "text": "Ethnic identity development\n\nEthnic identity development or ethnic-racial identity (ERI) development includes the identity formation in an individual's self-categorization in, and psychological attachment to, (an) ethnic group(s). Ethnic identity is characterized as part of one’s overarching self-concept and identification. It is distinct from the development of ethnic group identities.\n\nWith some few exceptions, ethnic and racial identity development is associated positively with good psychological outcomes, psychosocial outcomes (e.g., better self-beliefs, less depressive symptoms), academic outcomes (e.g., better engagement in school), and health outcomes (e.g., less risk of risky sexual behavior or drug use).\n\nDevelopment of ethnic identity begins during adolescence but is described as a process of the construction of identity over time due to a combination of experience and actions of the individual and includes gaining knowledge and understanding of in-group(s), as well as a sense of belonging to (an) ethnic group(s). It is important to note that given the vastly different histories of various racial groups, particularly in the United States, that ethnic and racial identity development looks very different between different groups, especially when looking at minority (e.g., Black American) compared to majority (e.g., White American) group comparisons.\n\nEthnic identity is sometimes interchanged with, held distinct from, or considered as overlapping with racial, cultural and even national identities. This disagreement in the distinction (or lack thereof) between these concepts may originate from the incongruity of definitions of race and ethnicity, as well as the historic conceptualization of models and research surrounding ethnic and racial identity. Research on racial identity development emerged from the experiences of African Americans during the civil rights movement, however expanded over time to include the experiences of other racial groups. The concept of racial identity is often misunderstood and can have several meanings which are derived from biological dimensions and social dimensions. Race is socially understood to be derived from an individual's physical features, such as white or black skin tone. The social construction of racial identity can be referred as a sense of group or collective identity based on one's perception that he or she shares a common heritage with a particular racial group. Racial identity is a surface-level manifestation based on what people look like yet has deep implications in how people are treated.\n\nGenerally, group level processes of ethnic identity have been explored by social science disciplines, including sociology and anthropology. In contrast, ethnic identity research within psychology usually focuses on the individual and interpersonal processes. Within psychology, ethnic identity is typically studied by social, developmental and cross-cultural psychologists.\nModels of ethnic development emerged both social and developmental psychology, with different theoretical roots.\n\nEthnic identity emerged in social psychology out of social identity theory. Social identity theory posits that belonging to social groups (e.g. religious groups or occupational groups) serves an important basis for one’s identity. Membership in a group(s), as well as one’s value and emotional significance attached to this membership, is an important part of one’s self-concept. One of the earliest statements of social identity was made by Kurt Lewin, who\nemphasized that individuals need a firm sense of group identification\nin order to maintain a sense of well-being. Social identity theory emphasizes a need to maintain a positive sense of self. Therefore in respect to ethnic identity, this underscores affirmation to and salience of ethnic group membership(s). In light of this, affirmation of ethnicity has been proposed to be more salient among groups who have faced greater discrimination, in order to maintain self-esteem. There has also been research on family influences, such as cultural values of the family. Also, specific aspects of parenting, such as their racial socialization of youth, can contribute to the socialization of adolescents.\n\nRelatedly, collective identity is an overarching framework for different types of identity development, emphasizing the multidimensionality of group membership. Part of collective identity includes positioning oneself psychologically in a group to which you share some characteristic(s). This positioning does not require individuals to have direct contact with all members of the group. The collective identity framework has been related to ethnic identity development, particularly in recognizing the importance of personal identification of ethnicity through categorical membership. Collective identity also includes evaluation of one’s category. This affective dimension is related to the importance of commitment and attachment toward one’s ethnic group(s). A behavioral component of collective identity recognizes that individuals reflect group membership through individual actions, such as language usage, in respect to ethnic identity.\n\nIdentity becomes especially salient during adolescence as recognized by Erik Erikson’s stage theory of psychosocial development. An individual faces a specific developmental crisis at each stage of development. In adolescence, identity search and development are critical tasks during what is termed the ‘Identity versus Role-confusion’ stage.\n\nAchievement of this stage ultimately leads to a stable sense of self. The idea of an achieved identity includes reconciling identities imposed on oneself with one’s need to assert control and seek out an identity that brings satisfaction, feelings of industry and competence. In contrast, identity confusion occurs when individuals fail to achieve a secure identity, and lack clarity about their role in life.\n\nJames Marcia elaborated on Erik Erikson’s model to include identity formation in a variety of life domains. Marcia’s focus of identity formation includes two processes which can be applied to ethnic identity development: an exploration of identity and a commitment. Marcia defines four identity statuses which combines the presence or absence of the processes of exploration and commitment: Identity diffusion (not engaged in exploration or commitment), identity foreclosure (a lack of exploration, yet committed), moratorium (process of exploration without having made a commitment), and identity achievement (exploration and commitment of identity).\n\nResearchers believe and have frequently reported that older individuals are more likely to be in an achieved identity status than younger people. Evidence shows that increasing age and a wide range of life experiences helps individuals develop cognitive skills. This combination of age, life experiences, and improved cognitive skills helps adolescents and young adults find their authentic selves. Adolescents with strong commitments to their ethnic identities also tend to explore these identities more than their peers.\n\nWhile children in early to middle childhood develop the ability to categorize themselves and others using racial and ethnic labels, it is largely during adolescence that ethnic and racial identity develops. Adriana J. Umaña-Taylor and colleagues write about the following concepts as playing key roles during this stage:\n\nCognitive milestones include: abstract thinking, introspection, metacognition, and further development of social-cognitive abilities.\n\nPhysiological changes include puberty and development of body image\n\nSocial and environmental context includes: family, peers, social demands and transitions, navigating an expanding world, and media\n\nERI components about process: \n\nERI components about content: \n\nJean Phinney’s model of ethnic identity development is a multidimensional model, with theoretical underpinnings of both Erikson and Marcia. In line with Erikson's identity formation, Phinney focuses on the adolescent, acknowledging significant changes during this time period, including greater abilities in cognition to contemplate ethnic identity, as well as a broader exposure outside of their own community, a greater focus on one's social life, and an increased concern for physical appearance.\n\nPhinney's Three Stage Progression: \nBroadly, socialization in the context of ethnic identity development refers to the acquisition of behaviors, perceptions, values, and attitudes of an ethnic group(s). This process recognizes that feelings about one’s ethnic group(s) can be influenced by family, peers, community, and larger society. These contextual systems or networks of influence delineate from ecological systems theory. These systems influence children’s feelings of belonging and overall affect toward ethnic group(s). Children may internalize both positive and negative messages and therefore hold conflicting feelings about ethnicity. Socialization highlights how early experiences for children are considered crucial in regards to their ethnic identity development.\n\n\nMore recently, Phinney has focused on the continuous dimensions of one's exploration and commitment to one's ethnic group(s), rather than on distinct identity statuses.\n\nResearch reveals ethnic identity development is related to psychological well-being. Ethnic identity has been linked with positive self-evaluation and self-esteem. Ethnic identity development has also been shown to serve as a buffer between perceived discrimination and depression.\nSpecifically, commitment of an ethnic identity may help to abate depressive symptoms experienced soon after experiencing discrimination, which in turn alleviates overall stress. Researchers posit commitment to an ethnic identity group(s) is related to additional resources accumulated through the exploration process, including social support. \nEthnic identity development has been linked to happiness and decreased anxiety. Specifically, regard for one’s ethnic group may buffer normative stress. Numerous studies show many positive outcomes associated with strong and stable ethnic identities, including increased self-esteem, improved mental health, decreased self-destructive behaviors, and greater academic achievement. In contrast, empirical evidence suggests that ethnic identity exploration may be related to vulnerability to negative outcomes, such as depression. Findings suggest this is due to an individual’s sensitivity to awareness of discrimination and conflicts of positive and negative images of ethnicity during exploration. Also, while commitment to an ethnic group(s) is related to additional resources, exploration is related to a lack of ready-access resources.\n\nStudies have found that in terms of family cohesion, the closer adolescents felt to their parents, the more they reported feeling connected to their ethnic group. Given the family is a key source of ethnic socialization, closeness with the family may highly overlap with closeness with one’s ethnic group. Resources like family cohesion, proportion of same-ethnic peers, and ethnic centrality act as correlates of within-person change in ethnic identity, but it is only on the individual level and not as adolescents as a group.\n\nEthnic identity development has been conceptualized and researched primarily within the United States. Due to the fact the individuals studied are typically from the United States, it may not be appropriate to extend findings or models to individuals in other countries. Some research has been conducted outside of the United States, however a majority of these studies were in Europe or countries settled by Europeans.\n\nFurther, researchers also suggest that racial and ethnic identity development must be viewed, studied, and considered alongside the other normative developmental processes (e.g., gender identity development) and cannot be considered in a vacuum - racial and ethnic identity exist in particular contexts.\nResearch considers some studies of ethnic developments cross-sectional in design. This type of design pales in comparison to longitudinal design whose topic of investigation is developmental in nature. This is because cross-sectional studies collect data at or around the same time from multiple individuals of different ages of interest, instead of collecting data over multiple time points for each individual in the study, which would allow the researcher to compare change for individuals over time, as well as differences between individuals.\n\nAnother research consideration in the field is why certain ethnic and racial groups are looking towards their own expanding community for mates instead of continuing interracial marriages. An article in \"The New York Times\" explained that Asian-American couples have been kicking the trend and finding Asian mates because it gives them resurgence of interest in language and ancestral traditions. Further research can be found and explored throughout the many different racial and ethnic groups.\n\nSome researchers question the number of dimensions of ethnic identity development. For example, some measures of ethnic identity development include measures of behaviors, such as eating ethnic food or participating in customs specific to an ethnic group. One argument is that while behaviors oftentimes express identity, and are typically correlated with identity, ethnic identity is an internal structure that can exist without behavior. It has been suggested one can be clear and confident about one's ethnicity, without wanting to maintain customs. Others have found evidence of a behavioral component of ethnic identity development, separate from cognition and affect, and pertaining to one's ethnic identity.\n\nEthnic identity development points toward the importance of allowing an individual to self-identify ethnicity during data collection. This method helps us collect the most accurate and relevant information about the subjective identification of the participant, and can be useful in particular with respect to research with multiethnic individuals.\n\n"}
{"id": "546684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=546684", "title": "Exposition (narrative)", "text": "Exposition (narrative)\n\nNarrative exposition is the insertion of important background information within a story; for example, information about the setting, characters' backstories, prior plot events, historical context, etc. In a specifically literary context, exposition appears in the form of expository writing embedded within the narrative. Exposition is one of four rhetorical modes (also known as \"modes of discourse\"), along with description, argumentation, and narration, as elucidated by Alexander Bain and John Genung. Each of the rhetorical modes is present in a variety of forms, and each has its own purpose and conventions. There are several ways to accomplish exposition.\n\nIndirect exposition, sometimes called incluing, is a technique of worldbuilding in which the reader is gradually exposed to background information about the world in which a story is set. The idea is to \"clue\" the readers in to the world the author is building without them being aware of it. This can be done in a number of ways: through dialogues, flashbacks, characters' thoughts, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a backstory. Instead of saying \"I am a woman\", a first person narrator can say \"I kept the papers inside my purse.\" The reader (in most English-speaking cultures) now knows the character is probably female.\n\nIndirect exposition has always occurred in storytelling incidentally, but is first clearly identified, in the modern literary world, in the writing of Rudyard Kipling. In his stories set in India like \"The Jungle Book\", Kipling was faced with the problem of Western readers not knowing the culture and environment of that land, so he gradually developed the technique of explaining through example. But this was relatively subtle, compared to Kiplings' science fiction stories, where he used the technique much more obviously and necessarily, to explain an entirely fantastic world unknown to any reader, in his Aerial Board of Control universe.\n\nKipling's writing influenced other science fiction writers, most notably the \"Dean of Science Fiction\", Robert Heinlein, who became known for his advanced rhetorical and storytelling techniques, including indirect exposition. \n\nThe word \"incluing\" is attributed to fantasy and science fiction author Jo Walton. She defined it as \"the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information.\" \"Information dump\" (or info-dump) is the term given for overt exposition, which writers want to avoid.

{"id": "12273038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12273038", "title": "Fertility in art", "text": "Fertility in art\n\nFertility in art refers to any artistic work representing or portraying fertility, which usually refers to successful breeding among humans, although it may also mean successful agriculture and animal husbandry. It includes engravings, drawings, paintings, sculptures, figurines, portraits and even literary works. In Paleolithic art, fertility is usually associated with figurines with exaggerated parts of human anatomy. \n\nMany civilisations in history believed in fertility deities. In Classical mythology, Gaia (to the Greeks) or Terra (to the Romans), the personification of Earth, is associated with female fertility. Women are often depicted with a ripe bosom, a child-bearing hip and a nude body in some cases. Animals that reproduce prolifically are also seen in art depicting fertility.\n\nFertility was present in art traditionally in many different forms. These include ceramic figures from some Pre-Columbian cultures, and a few figures from most of the ancient Mediterranean cultures. Many of these seem to be connected with fertility. Palielothic statuettes had round bellies, short heads and short, pointed legs. They also exaggerate the hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva of the subject.\n\nTwo of the earliest known possible depictions of fertility in art are the \"Venus of Willendorf\" (c. 25,000 BCE), an oolitic limestone figurine of a woman whose breasts and hips have been exaggerated to emphasise her fertility found in Austria and the \"Fertility Goddess\" of Cernavoda (c. 5,000 BCE) found in Romania, a small figurine that is meant to possibly show fertility. Historians consider these figurines to be goddesses. It is believed that worshippers would push the pointed legs into the earth to erect a temporary shrine for the goddess. The rotundity and obesity of these figurines were seen as attractive in early times when food was scarce.\n\nFertility is often shown in artworks related to Classical mythology. Paintings of the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite (Venus to the Romans) often portray her as sexual and fertile. Homer's \"Iliad\" states that Aphrodire (Venus) was born from the sperm/foam of the castrated genitals of Uranus. \"Venus Anadyomene\" is a painting by Apelles that shows Aphrodite rising from the sea. The original painting is now lost, but a colossal copy of the painting exists, painted by the artist Titian and known as \"Venus Anadyomene\" by Titian. It depicts Venus (Aphrodite) rising from the sea and wringing her wet hair after her birth, a pose inspired by an account of the original painting by Apelles. Demeter, the Greek goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships is often shown carrying a basket of apples in sculptures, which are meant to show fertility.\nHares are often portrayed in art as a symbol of rebirth and fertility. The Germanic goddess Eostre, whose themes are fertility and rebirth, is often surrounded by hares in art. \nIn Christianity, white rabbits are considered to be symbols of rebirth and fertility and are seen on a wing of the high altar in Freiburg Minster, where they are playing at the feet of two pregnant women, Mary and Elizabeth.\nIn Jan Van Eyck's \"Arnolfini portrait\", a carving of St. Margaret of Antioch (patron saint of childbirth) appears in the center background of the painting. The presence of this symbol in the painting either promises fertility in the marriage or announces the pregnancy of the bride.\n\nPaula Modersohn-Becker's series of self-portraits showing her pregnant even before she had actually been so represent her fertility.\n\nRembrandt's \"The Jewish Bride\" is a painting of a couple joined in love. Despite the title, none of the subjects in the painting are Jewish. The Painting portrays the fertility of the young couple, particularly that of the woman.\n\nThe shoe tied to the happy couple's car can be seen to represent the fertile vagina, as with The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe, a nursery rhyme.\n\nIn Botticelli's \"Primavera\", on one hand the Three Graces represented by nubile young women embody the sexual powers of springtime while opposite them Flora, the goddess of Spring is a symbol of motherhood and, by her distribution of the roses gathered in her skirt, believed to represent the good things of life.\n\nIn Picasso' paintings of Marie-Thérèse Walter, everywhere there is green, the colour of fertility and nature's renewal. In his series of sleeping nudes, Picasso may have been influenced by the much reproduced Hal Saflieni \"Reclining Woman\" and the Venuses of Lespugue and Willendorf, which with their heavy, ripe, bulging forms can be viewed as ancestresses of Picasso's images of female fecundity.\n\nIn \"The Bacchae\", an ancient Greek tragedy written by Athenian playwright Euripides, Dionysus is mentioned as a male fertility god that represented a special kind of vitality that is sometimes referred to as the Life Force. It is described a force which, in itself, is neither good nor bad, but one that simply exists.\n\nWhen at the close of \"Possession: A Romance\", a novel by A. S. Byatt, the two lovers Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte finally unite in the midst of a great storm. They wake the next day to find that the whole world had a strange new smell. It is described as 'a green smell, a smell of shredded leaves and oozing resin, of crushed wood and splashed sap, a tart smell, which bore some relation to the smell of bitten apples.' It was the described as the smell of death and destruction, however, it was said to smell fresh, lively and hopeful.\n\n\n"}

Around 246.000 people take part in these German courses per year.\n\nThe Goethe-Institut fosters knowledge about Germany by providing information on German culture, society and politics. This includes the exchange of films, music, theatre, and literature. Goethe cultural societies, reading rooms, and exam and language centers have played a role in the cultural and educational policies of Germany for more than 60 years.\n\nIt is named after German poet and statesman Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The Goethe-Institut e.V. is autonomous and politically independent.\n\nPartners of the institute and its centers are public and private cultural institutions, the federal states, local authorities and the world of commerce. Much of the Goethe-Institut's overall budget consists of yearly grants from the German Foreign Office and the German Press Office. The relationship with the Foreign Office is governed by general agreement. Self-generated income and contributions from sponsors and patrons, partners and friends broaden the scope of the work of the Goethe-Institut.\n\n\nThe Goethe-Institut is mainly financed by the national government of Germany, and has around 3,000 employees and an overall budget of approximately 366 million euros at its disposal, more than half of which is generated from language course tuition and examination fees. The Goethe-Institut offers scholarships, including tuition waiver, to students from foreign countries, who want to become teachers of German. One of the selection criteria for these scholarships is social or financial need.\n\nThe Goethe-Institut has its headquarters in Munich. Its president is Klaus-Dieter Lehmann, the General Secretary Johannes Ebert; Financial Manager Dr. Bruno Gross.\n\n\nThe Goethe-Institut offers e-learning courses as well.\n\nThe institute has developed a series of exams for learners of German as a foreign language (\"Deutsch als Fremdsprache\", DaF) at all levels: A1 up to C2. These can be taken both in Germany and abroad, and have been adapted to fit into the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFL), the standard for European language testing. There is also one exam, the \"Großes Deutsches Sprachdiplom\", which is at a higher level than the highest CEFL level. Below is a table of the basic Goethe-Institut exams as they fit into the scheme:\nIn 2000, the Goethe-Institut helped to found the Society for Academic Test Development (\"Gesellschaft für Akademische Testentwicklung e.V.\"). The resulting TestDaF exams are run by the TestDaF-Institut in Hagen. The tests are supported by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and are aimed at people who would like to study at German universities, academics and scientists. The TestDaF can be taken in Germany as well as in 65 other countries.\n\nHelen and Kurt Wolff Translator's Prize is an annual literary prize honoring an outstanding literary translation from German into English published in the USA the previous year. The translator of the winning translation receives $10,000 and a stay at the Literarisches Colloquium Berlin (LCB). The prize was established in 1996, and is funded by the German government. It was administered by the Goethe-Institut, Chicago until 2014. Since 2015, the prize has been administered by the Goethe-Institut New York.\n\nPrize recipients have included:\n\nOnce a year, the Goethe-Institut awards the Goethe Medal, an official decoration of the Federal Republic of Germany. It honours foreign personalities who have performed outstanding service for the German language and international cultural relations. The Goethe Medal was established by the executive committee of the Goethe-Institut in 1954 and acknowledged as an official decoration by the Federal Republic of Germany in 1975.\n\n\nIn 2005, along with the Alliance française, the Società Dante Alighieri, the British Council, the Instituto Cervantes, and the Instituto Camões, the Goethe-Institut was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for achievements in communications and the humanities.\n\nIn 2007, it received a special Konrad Duden Prize for its work in the field of German language.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44380379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44380379", "title": "Herbartianism", "text": "Herbartianism\n\nHerbartianism (Her-bart-ti-an-ism) is an educational philosophy, movement, and method loosely based on the educational and pedagogical thought of German educator Johann Friedrich Herbart, and influential on American school pedagogy of the late 19th century as the field worked towards a science of education. Herbart advocated for instruction that introduced new ideas in discrete steps. About a quarter-century after his death, Herbart's ideas were expanded in two German schools of thought that were later embodied in the method used at a practice school in Jena, which attracted educationists from the United States. Herbartianism was later replaced by new pedagogies, such as those of John Dewey.\n\nHerbartianism was used most often in adolescent instruction and was greatly influential on American school pedagogy in the 19th century. Herbart believed in maintaining the integrity of a student's individuality for as long as possible during the education process as well as an emphasis on moral training. The goal of herbartiainsim was to aid students in their learning process, beginning from no knowledge to complete knowledge.\n\nHerbart's pedagogical method was divided into discrete steps: preparation, presentation, association, generalization, and application. In preparation, teachers introduce new material in relation to the students' existing knowledge or interests, so as to instill an interest in the new material. In presentation, the new material is shown in a concrete or material fashion. In association, the new material is compared with the students' previous knowledge for similarities and differences, so as to note the new material's distinction. In generalization, the new material is extrapolated beyond concrete and material traits. In application, if the students have internalized the new material, they apply it towards every facet of their lives rather than in a utilitarian manner. Through this process, students will be able to achieve complete knowledge on the curriculum being taught. Herbartianism provided terminology for didactic theory and helped improve teachers professionalism.\n\nWhile the term \"Herbartianism\" derives transparently from Herbart's name, the movement was only loosely connected to his own ideas and was not an organized practice until 25 years after his death in 1841. Herbartianism was developed from Herbart's philosophy, and divided into two schools of thought. In the first, Tuiskon Ziller of Leipzig expanded on Herbart's philosophy of \"unification of studies\", especially around a single discipline (called \"correlation\" and \"concentration\", respectively). In the second, Karl Stoy of Jena opened a practice school in the style of Herbart's Königsberg school. A student of Ziller and Stoy, Wilhelm Rein, later led the Jena school and designed a German elementary school curriculum that the school used. This school became \"the center of Herbartian theory and practice and attracted students of pedagogy from outside Germany, including the United States\".\n\nBetween the 1890s and the early twentieth century, Herbartianism was influential in normal schools and universities as they worked towards a science of education. Adherents of Herbartianism founded the National Herbart Society in 1895 \"to study and investigate and discuss important problems of education\". Among those prominent in the society were Charles De Garmo (their first president), Charles Alexander McMurry, and Frank Morton McMurry, who all wrote on methods in education. The society also acknowledged works influenced by Herbartianism, such as two works by John Dewey, within a yearbook. The society removed Herbart from its name in 1902 and later became the National Society for the Study of Education.\n\nNewer pedagogical theories, such as those of John Dewey, eventually replaced Herbartianism. Though Herbartian work is unpopular in the 21st century, its greatest influence was in the 19th century's \"development of the science of education\". In the 1996 \"Philosophy of Education: An Encyclopedia\", J. J. Chambliss wrote that Herbartianism's influence shows wherever \"thinking, moral judgment, and conduct\" are considered simultaneously.\n\nReferences\n"}

Its antiquity is undetermined.\n\nAlthough many proponents allege that the Hotsuma predates the mainstream mythology, the first known manuscript was dedicated to a shrine by Waniko Yasutoshi (also known as Yunoshin Ibo) in 1775. Some excerpts were published and translated into modern Japanese in 1884, a printing which was noted by Hirata Atsutane in his work on \"jindai moji\", a Japanese writing system developed prior to the use of Chinese characters, but which otherwise ignored the work. Atsutane's Kokugaku was principally concerned with the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Hotsuma Tsutae\" would have only muddled his theories. Yasutoshi's manuscript was almost lost, but was discovered and rescued in 1993 following the publication of some popular books on the subject in the mid-20th century by Yoshinosuke Matsumoto.\n\nThe \"Hotsuma Tsutae\" is known for its text and rhythm. It was written in \"yamato-kotoba\", which only uses a Japanese vocabulary which predates contact with China. Some of the \"yamato-kotoba\" used in \"Hotsuma Tsutae\" are unattested elsewhere in the Old Japanese corpus but have parallels to old words, meaning that if it is a late medieval hoax it is extremely elaborate. Among other things in its primarily historical and non-mythological record, the text discusses the births, lives, and deaths of \"kami\" from Japanese folk shrines and history; in this case, the word \"kami\" being used to mean something like royalty and not \"gods\". In the poem, Amaterasu, the sun \"kami\" of Shinto, is male, and not female as is written in the official records. Matsumoto theorizes that Amaterasu was feminized in the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\" to provide a justification for the reign of Empress Suiko who reigned just before those documents were written.\n\nAlthough for the most part Japanese academics remain uninterested in this text, some scholars are of the opinion that it may have been written in the Edo period. This is due to claims that the text was written in an original Japanese alphabet - in academic circles, the existence of writing in Japan before the use of Chinese characters is denied, also the alphabet does not reflect the Old Japanese phonology but rather those of later stages of Japanese. The general opinion is that it is a false document. However, no definitive conclusion has yet been reached.\n\n\n"}

Conventionally, it is divided in two periods: the First Generation (Πρὠτη Γενιά) from 1815, till the end of the 1860s, and the Second Generation (Δεύτερη Γενιά) from 1871 and onwards. Prominent representatives of this genre include Nikolaos Mantzaros, Spyridon Xyndas, Spyridon Samaras, Pavlos Carrer and Dionysios Lavrangas.\nThe Music Museum of the Philharmonic Society of Corfu has in its collections several scores by these and other 19th and 20th century Ionian composers.\n\nThe major inspiration for the Ionian School was considered to be the Italian musical tradition. However, as late as the 1820s composers from Ionian Islands succeeded in shaping their own path towards 'national music' initially by using the Greek vernacular language, and later by incorporating folklore elements both from the local tradition and from that of mainland Greece.\n\n"}
{"id": "25161168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25161168", "title": "J-Setting", "text": "J-Setting\n\nJ-Setting is a style of dance popularized by the Prancing J-Settes, a popular collegiate female dance team of the Jackson State University's Sonic Boom of the South marching band. It originated in the late 1970s from African-Americans in the Jackson, Mississippi, area of the United States.\n\nThis dance style is characterized by a lead and follow format where one dancer initiates a series of high-energy dance moves, and the other dancers join in the movement. J-Setting features specific dance steps based on Prancing J-Settes marching techniques including the \"J-Sette Walk,\" the \"Salt and Pepper,\" the \"Strut,\" and the \"Tip Toe\". In particular, the \"Salt and Pepper\" is a type of prance step for which the Prancing J-Settes are named and known. It is a high-knee lift or \"high step\" style of marching. Alternating legs lift with a bent knee to bring the foot up to the height of the opposite knee before returning the foot to the ground.\n\nThe JSU Prancing J-Settes typically march and perform in rows organized by height. J-Setting dancers also typically perform in a line or in multiple lines. While performing, dancers may also change dance formation similar to the way that marching bands change formation during shows on football fields.\n\nThe J-Setting style of dress is modeled after the dance uniforms of the JSU Prancing J-Settes. It normally includes a one or two piece bodysuit or form-fitting garment that covers the torso and crotch; and hosiery with knee high boots on the legs. However, other types of garments are also worn during a performance.\n\nIn 1970, Shirley Middleton and the other majorettes of the Jackson State University Marching Band met with then JSU president, Dr. John A. Peoples, to request that they be permitted to \"put down their batons.\" The JSU President agreed; and as the majorette sponsor, Middleton assembled 18 female students to become the first Jaycettes (currently called J-Settes). Middleton, a formally trained ballet dancer, established technical performance standards for the J-Settes, as well as, standards for academic and personal behavior for its members when they were not performing. Dr. Jimmie James, Jr., then Chair of the JSU Department of Music, described the new dance team as \"the thrill of a thousand eyes.\" During Middleton's tenure, performances included dance routines to songs such as \"James Brown's \"Make it Funky,\" and \"Hot Pants\" as performed by the JSU Marching Band.\n\nPrior to 1975, Hollis Pippins, a former baton twirler for the JSU marching band, sometimes assisted J-Settes director Shirley Middleton, with choreography. In addition to performing with the JSU marching band, he performed on \"Soul Train\" and \"Putting on the Hits\" national television shows; and on \"Black Gold\", a local TV show. In 1975, Narah Oatis was appointed the sponsor of the Prancing J-Settes. Under her leadership, the \"J-Sette Walk\" and other signature marching steps were developed, and performances included an appearance on the \"30th Anniversary of Motown\" television show in 1990.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, African American gay men who were fans of The Prancing J-Settes regularly attended the dance team's practice sessions, and performances at college football games and other events. Young gay men brought the J-Settes dance style back to their home towns, and to gay nightclubs like Club City Lights in Jackson, Mississippi; Club Skittles Baton Rouge; Incognito, Allusions, and 901 in Memphis; and Club 708 in Atlanta.\n\nAlthough the Prancing J-Settes is a female dance team, in 1997 male JSU baton twirler DeMorris Adams performed with the J-Settes in place of an injured female member. However, the Prancing J-Settes have not confirmed this and, in fact, some have stated that it is not true. There is also no footage to substantiate this claim.\n\nBy the mid 2000s, J-Setting became popular in clubs such as: Club Candy'z, Splash Baton Rouge; Club Metro Jackson; Woodward, Tom Philips Post Detroit; Club 2020 Houston; Club Rush/ Chap Atlanta; Club Crystal's Lake Charles; Central Station Shreveport; and The Brick Dallas. Also several black gay pride events host organized J-Sette battles.\n\nIn 1990, the Prancing J-Settes performed the J-Settes style of marching and dancing on the \"30th Anniversary of Motown\" television show. The dance team appeared as part of the JSU Marching Band in performances to \"I Heard it through the Grapevine\"and other songs. A video of part of this performance is available on YouTube.\n\nIn 2003, the Prancing J-Settes performed the J-Settes marching and dancing style on the \"34th NAACP Image Awards\" television show. The dance team appeared as part of the JSU Marching Band in performances with comedian \"Cedric the Entertainer\" and \"Sugar Bear of E.U.\" A video of part of this performance is available on YouTube.\n\nIn 2008, both Beyoncé's \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and \"Diva\" music videos included a J-Setting style dance routine. Choreographer Frank Gatson is credited with introducing the J-Setting dance style to Beyoncé.\n\nJ-Setting troupes compete in dance-offs at gay cultural events. These groups of young gay men and women imitate the JSU Prancing J-Settes marching and dance style and dress. \nThese dance groups perform in costumes that are similar in appearance to the JSU J-Settes uniforms; including sequined one- and two-piece leotards, with long flowing capes, sheer stockings and white marching boots. Some of the popular J-Setting teams include: Jackson's Male Prancing J-Settes (MPJ); Memphis Elite; Atlanta's J-Phi; Texas Southern Heat; Texas Teasers of Dallas; D.M.B. of Atlanta; Atlanta Toxic; Jus Blaze; Dallas Diamonds; Baton Rouge Xtreme; Detroit Danz Zone; Nashville's Music City All-Starz; Capitol City Dolls International; Prancing Elites; Shreveport Pussy Cat Dolls; and Grambling, La.'s X-Men.\n\nThe competitions seen in Lifetime's Bring It! were inspired by J-Setting competitions.\n\nBeginning April 22, 2015, the Oxygen channel began broadcasting a 12-episode documentary series entitled \"The Prancing Elites Project\", focusing on the J-Setting group from Mobile, Alabama. The Prancing Elites had begun to attract national attention after a complimentary Tweet from Shaquille O'Neal in June 2013, which led to an appearance on the syndicated talk show \"The Real\".\n\nIn 2018, a released documentary entitled \"When The Beat Drops\", chronicled the progression of J-Setting and its impact on black gay culture (primarily in Atlanta).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8334597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8334597", "title": "Languages of the Soviet Union", "text": "Languages of the Soviet Union\n\nThe languages of the Soviet Union are hundreds of different languages and dialects from several different language groups.\n\nIn 1918, it was decreed that all nationalities in the Soviet Union had the right to education in their own language. The new orthography used the Cyrillic, Latin, or Arabic alphabet, depending on geography and culture. After 1937, all languages that had received new alphabets after 1917 began using the Cyrillic alphabet. This way, it would be easier for linguistic minorities to learn to write both Russian and their native language. In 1960, the school educational laws were changed and teaching became more dominated by Russian. \n\nIn 1975, Brezhnev said \"under developed socialism, when the economies in our country have melted together in a coherent economic complex; when there is a new historical concept—the Soviet people—it is an objective growth in the Russian language's role as the language of international communications when one builds Communism, in the education of the new man! Together with one's own mother tongue one will speak fluent Russian, which the Soviet people have voluntarily accepted as a common historical heritage and contributes to a further stabilization of the political, economic and spiritual unity of the Soviet people.\"\n\nEast Slavic languages (Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian) dominated in the European part of the Soviet Union, the Baltic languages Lithuanian and Latvian, and the Finnic language Estonian were used next to Russian in the Baltic region, while the Moldovan (the only Romance language in the union) was used in the southeast region. In the Caucasus alongside Russian there were Armenian, Azeri and Georgian. In the Russian far north, there were several minority groups who spoke different Uralic languages; most of the languages in Central Asia were Turkic with the exception of Tajik, which is an Iranian language.\n\nThe USSR was a multilingual state, with over 120 languages spoken natively. Although discrimination on the basis of language was illegal under the Soviet Constitution, the \"de facto\" status of these languages differed.\n\nAlthough the USSR did not have \"de jure\" an official language over most of its history, until 1990, and Russian was merely defined as the \"language of interethnic communication\" (), it assumed \"de facto\" the role of official language. For its role and influence in the USSR, see Russification.\n\nOn a second level were the languages of the other 14 Union Republics. In line with their \"de jure\" status in a federal state, they had a small formal role at the Union level (being e.g. present in the Coat of arms of the USSR and its banknotes) and as the main language of its republic. Their effective weight, however, varied with the republic (from strong in places like in Armenia to weak in places like in Byelorussia), or even inside it.\n\nOf these fourteen languages, two are often considered varieties of other languages: Tajik of Persian, and Moldovan of Romanian. Strongly promoted use of Cyrillic in many republics however, combined with lack of contact, led to the separate development of the literary languages. Some of the former Soviet republics, now independent states, continue to use the Cyrillic alphabet at present (such as Kyrgyzstan), while others have opted to use the Latin alphabet instead (such as Turkmenistan and Moldova – although the unrecognized Transnistria officially uses the Cyrillic alphabet).\n\nThe Autonomous republics of the Soviet Union and other subdivision of the USSR lacked even this \"de jure\" autonomy, and their languages had virtually no presence at the national level (and often, not even in the urban areas of the republic itself). They were, however, present in education (although often only at lower grades).\n\nSome smaller languages with very dwindling small communities, like Livonian, were neglected, and weren't present either in education or in publishing.\n\nSeveral languages of non-titular nations, like German, Korean or Polish, although having sizable communities in the USSR, and in some cases being present in education and in publishing, were not considered to be Soviet languages. On the other hand, Finnish, although not generally considered a language of the USSR, was an official language of the Karelia and its predecessor as a Soviet republic. Also Yiddish and Romany were considered Soviet languages.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "205789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205789", "title": "Mandatory Swedish", "text": "Mandatory Swedish\n\nIn Finland, Swedish is a mandatory school subject for Finnish-speaking pupils in the last four years of the primary education (grades 6 to 9). This so-called \"other domestic language\" is also mandatory in high schools, vocational schools, and vocational universities. Furthermore, all university graduates must demonstrate a certain level of proficiency in Swedish (the so-called \"public servant's Swedish\"). Altogether 89% of Finnish citizens are native Finnish speakers, whereas 5.3% of the population report Swedish as their mother tongue. Currently, it is possible for Finnish citizens to report a different mother tongue for themselves at any time, and as many times as desired, by submitting a form to the Population Register Center.\n\nAccording to the Finnish constitution, both Finnish and Swedish are national languages. The employees of the national government and the bilingual municipal governments are required to be able to serve citizens in Swedish. Military service is not required in the autonomous region of Åland. The official term for both mandatory Swedish and Finnish is \"the other domestic language\". However, the requirement to study Swedish is often referred to as \"pakkoruotsi\", a somewhat charged term in Finnish meaning \"mandatory Swedish\", or \"enforced Swedish\".\n\nThe status of Swedish as a national language in Finland is defined by the Finnish constitution. There was migration of Swedish-speaking peasants to some Finnish coastal areas during the Middle Ages. During this period, when Finland was ruled by Sweden, Swedish language became part of the culture in the coastal areas. Swedish was also the language of the ruling class. The Finnish language was forbidden an official status alongside Swedish until the period of Russian rule (1809–1917), in 1860. The autonomous Åland Islands (pop. 26,000, 95% Swedish, 5% Finnish) has only one official language, Swedish, and the speaking of Finnish between employees is forbidden in some public services.\n\nIn Mainland Finland both official languages, Finnish and Swedish, are mandatory subjects for pupils in primary and secondary schools. The Swedish test of the Matriculation Examination was made voluntary in 2004, although all university graduates must demonstrate that their skills in the other official language meet the standard required of all academically educated public servants. Usually this means the completion of a so-called \"public servant's Swedish\" test. The Swedish language is also one of the main agendas of the Swedish People's Party that has been a minor partner in most Cabinets since Finland's independence, and in all Cabinets between 1972 and 2015.\n\nSupporters of Mandatory Swedish argue that it brings Finland closer to the Nordic countries, since Swedish is quite similar to, and to some extent mutually intelligible with, both Danish and Norwegian, while Finnish belongs to the unrelated Finnic language group. Supporters also say that studying Swedish makes it easier to learn other Germanic languages, such as English and German. Lastly, they argue, mandatory Swedish is necessary to ensure that Swedish-speakers can interact with governmental institutions and get service, such as health care, in their own mother tongue.\n\nThe area that today is Finland was an integral part of Sweden proper from the Middle Ages to the end of the Finnish War in 1809. Swedish migrants settled in coastal areas, and the language of administration was Swedish. This prompted many Finnish-speakers to learn Swedish in hopes of improving their social status, and some switched to Swedish altogether.\n\nAs a result of the Finnish War, Sweden ceded Finland to Russia, and the Russian tsar established the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. Although a Governor-General was installed by the Russians as the highest authority within the Grand Duchy, much of the political system remained the same: Finland was allowed to keep its ”laws, religion and language” from the Swedish time. The tsar wanted to avoid trouble in the new territory and also used former Swedish upper class to further modernisation in Russia; Finnish was not an option at that time as official language, as the administration did not know Finnish well enough and the language was undeveloped regarding such use.\n\nWhen Finland became autonomous there was a big interest in creating a new national identity. There was an immense interest in the Finnish language and Finnish culture in the mostly Swedish speaking upper class. At some point the Fennoman movement arose, that thought that the country should be a united nation, with only one language, and, as a reaction, the Svecoman movement, that was afraid that abandoning Swedish would lead to slavicisation or worse.\n\nHowever, during the 1860s, under Tsar Alexander II, it was decided that legal equality between Finnish and Swedish as languages of administration was to be gradually introduced. Thus since the late 19th century Finnish has been a co-official language of administration in Finland. Modernizations typical for the era in Europe were introduced, boosting the status of the Finnish-speaking majority: the special rights of the higher estates of the realm were abolished, a modern parliament based on universal suffrage was introduced 1907 and in 1917 Finland became independent.\n\nIn the current form, mandatory Swedish was implemented as a part of the modernisation of the educational system in the 1970s. Previously, a Swedish test had been compulsory on university level and in \"oppikoulu\", a secondary school that was a prerequisite to matriculation to a university, but not in the common \"kansakoulu\". The introduction of the \"peruskoulu\" (student ages 7–15), compulsory for all children, introduced a course in Swedish compulsory to all pupils, while Swedish courses and standardized tests at higher levels remained compulsory. This was motivated by the possibility that any student could become a public official and would thus be required to know Swedish.\n\nA compulsory introductory course to Swedish for all pupils in primary education was introduced in the 1960s as a part of modernization of the primary education system, where the nine-year school (\"peruskoulu, grundskola\") was made universally compulsory. Until then there had been mandatory courses only in secondary and tertiary education. Administrative services have, since the end of the 19th century, been offered in both domestic languages; therefore, theoretically employees should be proficient in both Finnish and Swedish. The reform was to some extent based on a political ambition to strengthen the ties with the Western world through Scandinavia, and to show that Finland was a part of the Nordic countries, and not an Eastern Bloc country. It also sought to improve social mobility by ensuring that a decision on language in the early school years would not become an obstacle for applicants to the civil service.\n\nIn the upper secondary general school all the students learn at least two languages besides their mother tongue, one of which is the other domestic language, except for people studying some other language as mother tongue (e.g. immigrants and those studying Sami). Finnish speakers take Swedish, and vice versa. According to Statistics Finland, practically all the students take English, either as a compulsory or an optional language. There is also a possibility to take one or more extra foreign languages. Despite Finland being a neighbour of Russia, Russian is not taught in most schools of Finland, and only 1.5% of Finns know some Russian. The hindrances are cultural and political, as there has been relatively little cultural exchange between the Finns and Russians in the 20th century, and Finland's relations with the Soviet Union were hostile from the Finnish Civil War (1918) until World War II (1939–1944).\n\nThe arrangement of \"mandatory Swedish and practically-mandatory English\" has been criticized, because it reduces the diversity of the language skills of the population. The EU target is to teach two foreign languages. As English is an overwhelmingly popular choice, it has been suggested by, for example, the Confederation of Finnish Industries that keeping Swedish compulsory directly prevents choosing other languages, such as Russian.\n\nA number of studies into opinions regarding mandatory Swedish have been made with various results. The big differences between studies exemplifies the problems in conducting a neutral and broad study without asking leading questions on the particular subject. Furthermore, some of the studies have been commissioned by organizations that have politically partisan views on the subject of mandatory Swedish.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2003 Taloustutkimus Oy conducted a series of more than ten surveys for Suomalaisuuden liitto, an organisation opposing mandatory Swedish. According to these surveys, 66–72% of Finns were \"in favour of voluntary Swedish education or against mandatory Swedish education\".\n\nSuomen Gallup's 2003 survey concluded that while a small majority supported \"compulsory second domestic language studying\", it was opposed by 42% of Finns while 25% did not want both Finnish and Swedish to be official languages of Finland. This study was commissioned by Yle, the Finnish publicly funded national broadcasting company. The question posed to those surveyed was very verbose in comparison to the Taloustutkimus surveys on the same subject. The question did not include the word \"Swedish\".\n\nIn 1992 a study by \"Valitut Palat\" (the Finnish edition of \"Reader's Digest\") concluded that 90 percent of the parents of third to fourth grade pupils \"supported a reduction of compulsory languages\" (only Finnish and Swedish are compulsory). When \"Valitut Palat\" did a new survey in 2003 it found 64% opposing mandatory Swedish, and 25% not wanting to have two official languages.\n\nAn IEA study (2000) revealed that 67% of young people studying in Finnish-speaking schools wanted to make Swedish a voluntary subject. The most politically aware youths were the most critical against Swedishness in this study.\n\nA study conducted in 1997 by Folktinget, an official consultative organisation representing Finland's Swedish-speakers, concluded that 70% of the Finnish-speaking population considered \"Swedish a vital and important part of Finnish society.\" This study also indicated that the most negative opinions about mandatory Swedish were found among those with academic degrees.\n\nA study conducted by Taloustutkimus for Yle in 2013 indicated that 63 percent of respondents were opposed to mandatory Swedish. Further, the study indicated that among the supporters of the different political parties, only the supporters of the Swedish People's Party and the Green League favoured retaining mandatory Swedish teaching. A majority of supporters in all the other parties wanted Swedish teaching to be voluntary – the supporters of the Finns Party and the Social Democrats were most heavily in favour of making Swedish voluntary (76 and 73 percent respectively).\n\nA study conducted by Åbo Akademi in 2014 indicated that 74 percent of Finnish speaking respondents agreed with the statement \"The teaching of the Swedish language should be voluntary\".\n\nIn many cases, pupils have negative expectations and experiences of learning Swedish which may foster a negative attitude towards the Swedish language and culture. This behavior is claimed to hark back to the time when Finland was a part of Sweden (see Sweden–Finland), and Swedish was the language of prestige while Finnish was looked down on by the government. Negative opinions towards studying Swedish are also grounded in the fact that mandatory Swedish is taught throughout the country, even though there are few Swedish-speakers in mainland Finland outside the coastal area by the Baltic Sea, and thus contact with Swedish-speakers is rare for most Finns. This fact can for some make the policy of bilingualism seem artificial, but the basic curriculum remains the same for the entire country.\n\nAccording to a study published in 2002 students are interested in the Swedish language, and find it an important part of education, but they perceived Swedish being compulsory lessened their motivation (this argument has been made very frequently in the public debate). The experiment of making the Swedish test voluntary in the matriculation examination (the completion of which is a \"de facto\" requirement for university enrollment) was declared successful and was made permanent. The percentage of students taking the Swedish test has since been constantly dropping and was 67% in 2009 (less than 50% of boys).\n\nThere has also been a lot of criticism of the methodology used to teach Swedish and the lack of competence in many of the teachers. This has contributed to students' lack of motivation to study Swedish, and many may not learn to speak the language beyond a very basic level. Some students argue that they will never need Swedish as its utility in the Finnish job market is limited to a few fields. Moreover, the rationale of mandatory tuition in Swedish and other subjects is to give the students more of a general knowledge base, and not train them for a specific field.\n\nIn addition to the direct costs of the tuition, some argue that mandatory Swedish effectively replaces elective courses in languages such as French, German and Russian, that these persons argue are more important than Swedish in a globalized world. University students are required not only to master their selected field, but also to study at least two languages beside their mother tongue, one of which is obligatorily Swedish for Finnish-speakers. As study material is often in English, this effectively removes the free choice; the two \"voluntarily chosen\" languages must be Swedish and English. Despite being a neighbour of Russia, it is in practice possible to study Russian only in some schools (due to low interest or it not being offered); only 1.5% of the Finns have a good knowledge of Russian. Also very few Finns speak Estonian (which is not taught in most schools), a language of the same Finnic language group as Finnish, and national language of Finland's southern neighbour Estonia, although Finnish is popular in Estonia.\n\nSentiments toward mandatory Swedish vary. Many prominent politicians (both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking) wholeheartedly support mandatory Swedish in schools, while others oppose it. There have been numerous petitions and other similar campaigns arranged by some small but dedicated organizations to pressure the lawmakers to abolish mandatory Swedish, but to date, they have had no significant impact on the established policy. Thus, while the ongoing debate is often heated and passionate, the support for mandatory Swedish tuition remains strong enough among politicians for the government not to consider a change of policy.\n\nMandatory Swedish is supported by most political parties in Finland, like the National Coalition Party, the Centre Party, the Social Democrats and the Left Alliance. The Finns Party opposes mandatory Swedish, and so does the youth wing of the National Coalition Party.\n\nIn 2013 the Confederation of Finnish Industries came out in favour of making Swedish teaching voluntary. They referred to a study which indicated that in the future Swedish will be only the tenth most important language to Finnish companies, when they are considering the language skills of their potential employees. According to Hufvudstadsbladet, the Confederation has subsequently changed their stance and no longer favours making Swedish voluntary, while maintaining the need for learning other languages.\n\nIn the 2000s the government dropped the requirement to take Swedish (or Finnish in the case of the Swedish-speaking minority) as part of the high school matriculation examination.\n\nIn 2014 a citizens' initiative demanding an end to mandatory Swedish teaching on all levels of education was brought to the Finnish Parliament. In 2015 the MPs voted, 134 to 48, to keep mandatory Swedish. In another vote the MPs voted, 93 to 89, to demand that the government should examine, whether a regional experimentation, where another language would be taught instead of Swedish, is possible.\n\n\n"}

It’s a substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen. Water has always played a prominent role in human civilization. A sufficient supply of safe drinking water is one of the important requirement for a healthy life, but waterborne diseases plays a deadly role in creating large numbers of deaths in many parts of the world. All living things require water to grow and reproduce their own kind. Water is a tasteless and odorless liquid at room temperature. Water is the only substance that occurs naturally as a solid in the form of ice, a liquid and a gas which is in the form of water vapor. Water covers 71% of the entire Earth surface. The amount of water in this world isn't diminishing, but the demand is steadily increasing. Scientists believe that the world's population, will double by 2050. In addition to this, the amount of fresh water that is clean and safe to drink is steadily decreasing because of pollutants. So, people are in need of drinking water in its purest form. There are plenty of water purifiers available in the market which use different techniques like boiling, filtration, distillation, chlorination, sedimentation and oxidation. Currently nanotechnology plays a vital role in water purification techniques. In nanotechnology, nano membranes are used with the purpose of softening the water and removal of contaminants such as physical, biological and chemical contaminants. There are variety of techniques in nanotechnology which uses nano particles for providing safe drinking water with a high level of effectiveness. Some techniques have become commercialized.\n\nFor better water purification or treatment processes nanotechnology is preferred. Many different types of nanomaterials or nanoparticles are used in water treatment processes. Nanotechnology holds great promise in remediation, desalination, filtration, purification and water treatment.\n\nThe main features that make nanoparticles effective for water treatment are \n\nThis LifeSaver Bottle is designed so that it is very simple for its user to get clean water. It's a microbiological water filter that uses nanotechnology to filter out bacteria, viruses, cysts and parasites from contaminated water sources. Based on recommendations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) It filters out bacteria to a minimum level of Log 6 (99.9999%), cysts to a minimum level of Log 3 (99.9%) and viruses to a minimum level of Log 4 (99.99%) as specified by NSF Protocol 231. It can be used to Collect water from the source we want and then the bottom of the bottle is uncapped in order to fill it up. The bottle consists of a pump at its bottom. So, once the bottle is full, it should be tightly closed and then pumped. The pressure that builds up by pumping will make the water to pass through the filter by purifying it.The bottle's interchangeable filter can purify between 4,000 and 6,000 litres, but once it stops working, the filter should be replaced. It filters out objects bigger than 15 nm, including viruses, bacteria etc. For 0.71 litres of water to be filtered, 20sec is all it takes. Soldiers use this Lifesaver bottle for drinking water. With a capacity of 750ml and a filter life of up to 6,000 litres, this advanced personal purifier will ensure us to have fresh, pure water when we need it. The principle of a lifesaver bottle is a nanofiltration technology. This is highly effective against all forms of pathogen as well as suspended particles. It is effective against bacteria to a minimum of 99.999% removal and viruses up to 99.99%.\n\nLifesaver Jerrycan is a portable water purification system. It is commonly used for storage and purification purpose. The capacity of lifesaver jerrycan is 18.5L. It can process up to 10,000-20,000L. It can filter out particle up to 0.015 microns. The minimum and maximum operating temperature is about 32 °F and 140 °F. The minimum and maximum storage temperature is 14 °F and 140 °F. The initial flow rate is 2 l/min. Molecular weight cutoff is 200 KDa. The largest version of lifesaver bottle is called as lifesaver jerrycan. It consists of an air pump that creates pressure inside the can so that the water enters through the filtration membrane and gets filtered. Dirty water is carried inside the can itself while the filtered water is obtained from the filtered spout. Activated carbon filter removes chlorine, bad odour and taste. It also removes heavy metals, medical residues and chemical pesticides that include pesticides endocrine disrupting compounds. It also removes suspended particle in the water. The main purpose of lifesaver jerrycan is to remove the biological impurities. It includes the removal of bacteria, viruses, parasites and various forms of cysts. It can remove viruses greater than 99.999% (log 4) and cysts up to 99.99% (log 3).Here the bacteria reduction is greater than 99.999995% (log 7.5).One jerrycan filter can provide water for four people over a three-year span\n\nLife Saver cube is a novel and portable water purifier which filters the contaminated water and provides clean water instantly and thus making it fit for drinking purpose. It is predominantly used as a household water purifier. It consists of a cube of 5 litre capacity and dirty water can be stored inside the cube. Also, there is an internal membrane through which the dirty water is forced to pass through it, in order to remove the contaminants present in it. The contaminants may be bacteria, viruses or some other pathogens. The pore size of the membrane filter is 15 nm and it can remove the biological contaminants efficiently and provide clean drinking water. This means that the filter is capable of removing 99.9% contaminants. The pressure necessary for forcing the water through the nano filter membrane is provided by a small pump. The weight of the Life Saver Cube is 1.2 kg which makes it easy to transport or carry the system from one place to another and hence forth clean water can be obtained anywhere, anytime. This can be used to filter nearly 5,000 litres of dirty water in its lifetime and the flow rate of the filter is 1 litre/minute.\n\nNanoceram family of pleated filter cartridges are another type of sediment filters. They are designed in such a way that it could satisfy the difficulties in water treatment. When multilayer is used, it is capable of retaining 99.9999% of microbes (includes viruses, bacteria, and protozoa which are cryptosporidium, Giardia intestinalis, Legionella pseudomonas, salmonella, E.coli, Mycobacteria, Aspergillus, Endotoxins and DNA, all at flow rates hundreds of times greater than virus rated ultrafiltration membrane. The water turbidity which comes through the nanoceram media remains below 0.01NTU. Nanoceram filters use a highly electropositive filter media that absorbs particles quickly even it is too small. Each nanoceram electropositive water filter has a high capacity for particles ranging from tens of microns to few nanometers. The main advantage of this filter is that it uses a media for adsorptive removal process that has 42,000 square meters of nanofiber surface area per square meter of filter media of loading capacity. Sub-micron particles are electronegative due to the double layer effect. At a pH of 7.2, this particles are attracted due to the high zeta potential between the particle or hydrocarbon droplet and the media.\n\nDesalination is a viable solution for a water scarcity. But it has economical effect in society. So, we need a cost-effective alternative method for desalination. Nano H2O is next level of reverse osmosis (RO) and membrane technology. And also it is one of the cost-effective technique. The University of California discovers a lot of these membrane technologies. In recent days Nano H2O membrane is commercially available in a market. This membrane contains 9 nanoparticles in a non-woven polyester fabric and a layer of porous polysulfone film followed by proprietary Nanocomposite material to form a quantum flux membrane. It increases membrane permeability by 50-100 % over conventional methods. This layer gives higher throughput and best salt rejection. It is folded and packed by a Nanocomposite material and prepared to 4 to 8-inch tube vessel. This technology gives higher flux than the thin film composite so that we get more water with less energy. In quantum flux membrane technology, energy consumption is 20 to 70% less than the other conventional method. For the supply of more water, this technology developed for reverse osmosis with Nano H2o membrane. It produces higher yield with low cost. So, it has high-level customer services in a global network.\n\nNanocellulose based renewable material has a combination of high surface area with high material strength. It is chemically inert and possesses versatile hydrophilic surface chemistry. These properties make them a most promising nanomaterial for usage membrane and filter in water purification system to remove bacterial and chemical contaminants from polluted water. It is noted that nanocellulose material has high potential in water purification technology. Different types of nanocellulose materials available for water purification system includes Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and Cellulose nanofibrils (CNF). These are the rod-like nanomaterials whose size ranges from 100 to 2000 nm with the diameter of 2 to 20 nm. Those length and diameter are mostly based on origin and preparation route for the synthesis of nanocellulose. Those nanocellulose materials are used to remove organic pollutants in water such as dyes, oils and pesticides traces present in water. Presently fully biobased membrane using nanocellulose are fabricated which is used to remove metal ions such as Cu2+, Fe2+ etc, sulfates, fluorides and other organic compounds. This bio-based nanocellulose filter has more advantage to conventional filters. Nanocellulose is prepared by various methods such as sulphuric acid hydrolysis and mechanical grinding method. Water purification system is mainly based on the principle of absorption. For the absorption of anionic metal species, the nanocellulose materials are functionalized with a positive charged cationic group. Similarly, for the absorption of cationic metal species, the nanocellulose material is functionalized with the negatively charged anionic group. Nanocellulose based materials have limitation in cost for large-scale production and its specificity. Presently research is based on the synthesis of hybrid nanocellulose material in combination with several other nanomaterials for the improvement of adsorption capacity.\n\nGraphene is chemically dormant, mechanically sturdy, and non-permeable to gas or liquid. So, carbon plays a major role for fabrication of nanomaterials with porous nature. Graphene membranes that are formed by graphene oxide molecules or chemically converted graphene that is adhered with 2D nano mediated arrays have the ability to efficiently separate molecules in a gas or in a liquid phase. Graphene-coated nanomembranes are said to be more applicable in water treatment due to its unique properties. Graphene membranes are obtained from vacuum filtration or coating of graphene oxide solution as Graphene oxide sheets. The graphene coated nanofiltration membrane showed a higher water flux range. The graphene embedded with carbon nanotubes to serve as nanofilters is more useful for dye rejection in water effluent, removal of salt ions, and also acts as antifouling agent. Graphene nanofilter membranes possess effective antifouling agent due to its strong bond between graphene sheets and proteins. Also, graphene oxide coated nanofilter membranes helps in dechlorination of water.In addition to this, ultrathin nanofilter coated with graphene is the most potent filter that could be commercialized for water purification. Graphene oxide membranes can be used in various forms such as free, surface modified, and graphene cast in membranes in the range of micro, nano, or ultrafilters. Among which nanofilters is more efficient for water desalination due to its mechanical strength and physiochemical properties of the membrane. Moreover, there are some challenges in fabricating and applying graphene oxide based nanofilters for water desalination. The challenges include mechanical instability if nanofilters are in the form of nanosheets, cost strategy, surface flaws, and assembly.Therefore, there are more scopes in this area of research to be worked on for the betterment of the society.\n\nCarbon nanotubes have gained much attention for its use as wastewater and water filter. Carbon nanotube’s mechanical, electrical and chemical properties made it unique and an ideal candidate for research since 1990. Carbon nanotube combined with electrochemistry proved to be the best method for water and wastewater purification. Electrochemistry helps in reducing the fouling rate of the CNT. In case of CNT based ultra-filters modified with electrochemistry, helps in reducing the energy by two folds comparing to an unmodified CNT based filters. Thus electrochemical carbon nanotubes have been developed due to the advanced studies in nanotechnology and electrochemistry. Here the electrochemical activity of the CNT is exploited. Very first electrochemical CNT was developed by P.J.Britto etal and the results were first recognized in 1996. An electrochemical CNT filter contains electrodes and CNT in a systematic setup such that the electrodes can attract the wastes that clog the CNT based on its charges, thus resulting in high efficiency of filtering and extension of the lifetime of the CNT in the process. The electrochemical carbon nanotubes can be easily used for removing amino group based dyes from wastewater. Chen etal first reported the absorption of dyes to the CNT walls by strong covalent bonds. These electrochemical CNT can be typically used for filtering, and recycling wastewater. Currently, there are many unannounced advancements in CNT based electrochemical sensors and these are highly under research to bring its applications into biomedical systems.\n\n"}

Accepting a limited number of students selected each year from up to eight cities across the United States, the program operates from the beginning of June and runs through the end of July, annually. OperaWorks was founded in 1987 by classical pianist Ann Baltz as a response to what she saw as the myopic tendencies of conventional operatic training. Baltz envisioned a new approach to the training of vocalists, in which the \"total instrument\" would be addressed, not just the voice itself. Over the years, her program has expanded to include instruction in movement, Yoga, acting, visualization, conducting, improvisation and the Alexander technique, as well as career management. \n\nBorrowing to some degree from teaching techniques long utilized in contemporary theatrical training, OperaWorks strives to free the individual vocal artist in such a manner that the physical conventions and artifice of opera performance can fall away, hopefully revealing something altogether truer to life itself. Recognizing the uniqueness of each individual artist, OperaWorks endeavors to develop singers from the inside out, thus enabling them to trust their own instincts – musically, emotionally, dramatically.\n\nIn 2006, Baltz invited independent filmmaker Brad Mays to spend an entire summer filming the various classes and events at OperaWorks.

It was one of the largest and better known urban tribes in the country.\n\nPokemones dressed similarly to other urban tribes, such as otaku and emo, but they were not followers of anime like the former, nor shared the musical tastes of the latter. Apart from borrowing aspects from the emo, like the sideswept bangs, the Pokemones also shared some aspects typical to the punk and the local \"hardcore\" subculture. Pokemones were livelier, more extroverted than the emo and otaku stereotypes. Most Pokemones were teens. During parties they danced to reggaeton music, while kissing and groping with as many people (male or female) as they could, which they called \"poncear\".

{"id": "1963761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963761", "title": "Pot boiler", "text": "Pot boiler\n\nA pot boiler is a heated stone used to heat water.\n\nIn an archaeological / anthropological context, the term refers to a stone used to move heat from a fire to a vessel to raise the temperature of water in the vessel, including for cooking. The stone is heated in a fire or in embers. When hot enough, the stone is transferred into a vessel of water to heat the contents. The vessel may be metal (though this is uncommon, metal normally being tough enough to take direct heat from a fire) or pottery which is not of good enough quality to be directly exposed to the heat of the fire. In a pre-pottery context, the heating can be done by lining a pit with leather, leaves or clay, and then putting in the water followed by pot boilers directly into the vessel.\n\nThe repeated exposure to the heat of the fire followed typically by rapid chilling in water leads to great thermal stress on the stone's fabric due to the thermal expansion and contraction. This typically leads to partial glazing of the stone's surface and a fine network of cracks on the stone's surface (often described as \"crazing\"). Eventually the stone shatters. Individual fragments may be re-used until it becomes infeasible to manipulate the stone into and out of the fire, at which point the fragments are discarded and a new pot boiler (or many new ones) are acquired. Often the broken pot boilers are discarded into middens or domestic waste deposits, which on long-established sites can amount to many tonnes of material.\n\nReuse as building material is not impossible, but the typical small size of the fragments hinders this use.\n\nSurface \"crazing\" is not restricted to pot boilers - hearth stones and the surrounds of fireplaces may also show the same structure. However, since a pot boiler needs to be manipulated into and out of the fire (typically in anthropological observations, using sticks of green wood) at arm's length, they start off weighing up to several kilogrammes, and shrink by fragmentation ; hearth stones and chimney liners are typically larger.\n\n"}

A smattering of adventurers began to arrive at the site in the 1950s, and in 1969 the site was visited by the Peruvian physician/explorer Dr. Carlos Neuenschwander Landa (who would return in later years accompanied by Peruvian explorer, Sr. Santiago Yábar). In 1970 another peripatetic Dominican, Padre Adolfo Torrealba, reached the site, followed by Japanese explorer Yoshiharo Sekino, and the French-Peruvian explorers Herbert and Nicole Cartagena in 1978. Two years later came the Peruvian archaeologist Federico Kauffmann Doig. In 1991 the party of North American explorer Gregory Deyermenjian, including Peruvian explorer Paulino Mamani and the previously mentioned Santiago Yábar, arrived at Pusharo. The site has since been visited and studied by rock art scholar Rainer Hostnig.\n\nIn 2008, it was the subject of a documentary-trek filmed for the BBC television series \"Extreme Dreams\" presented by Ben Fogle.\n\nThe site is made up of an array of deeply incised rock carvings that cover up to a height of 9 feet, a perpendicular rock face that is over 100 feet long and 75 feet high. Its location is on the south shore of the Río Palatoa (designated on some maps at this location as the Porotoa, and known by others as the Palatoa Chico). The petroglyphs are thought by some researchers to be purely pan-Amazonian in origin, and of mistico-religious or shamanic significance to those Amerindians of past centuries who must have been their creators. Others believe that there is an Incan component that is now coming to light, and that the glyphs constitute parts of a map. Definitive word on the meaning of Pusharo's glyphs must wait until further research is conducted and completed. The glyphs contain elements such as heart-shaped faces, some with double borders, spirals, zigzags, suns, \"curlicue X's\" and others that defy verbal description.\n\n"}

A drug tourist may cross a national border to obtain a drug that is not sold in one's home country, or to obtain an illegal drug that is more available in the visited destination. A drug tourist may also cross a sub-national border (from one province/county/state to another) in order to purchase alcohol or tobacco more easily, or at a lower price due to tax laws or other regulations.\n\nEmpirical studies show that drug tourism is heterogeneous and might involve either the pursuit of mere pleasure and escapism or a quest for profound and meaningful experiences through the consumption of drugs.\n\nDrug tourism has many legal implications, and persons engaging in it sometimes risk prosecution for drug smuggling or other drug-related charges in their home jurisdictions or in the jurisdictions they are visiting, especially if they bring their purchases home rather than using them abroad. The act of traveling for the purpose of buying or using drugs is itself a criminal offense in some jurisdictions.\n\nMalana, India is famous for its production of Indian hashish, attracting foreign tourists. Indian pharmacies also sell many generic drugs at prices far lower than in the US.\n\nIn Europe, the Netherlands, and especially the Dutch capital, Amsterdam, is a popular destination for drug tourists, due to the liberal attitude of the Dutch toward cannabis use and possession. Drug tourism thrives because legislation controlling the sale, possession, and use of drugs varies dramatically from one jurisdiction to another.\nIn May 2011 the Dutch government announced that tourists would to be banned from Dutch coffeeshops, starting in the southern provinces at the end of 2011, and the rest of the country by 2012, though this was never made into law and thus coffeeshops throughout the Netherlands continue remain open to tourists as of May 2016. On 25 November 2014 two British tourists aged 20 and 21 died in a hotel room in Amsterdam, after snorting white heroin that was sold as cocaine by a street dealer. The bodies were found less than a month after another British tourist died in similar circumstances. At least 17 other people have had medical treatment after taking the white heroin.\n\nDrug tourism from the United States occurs in many contexts. Americans between the ages of 18 and 21 may cross the border into Canada or Mexico to purchase alcohol. Conversely, many Canadians travel to the United States to purchase alcohol at lower prices due to high taxes levied on alcohol in Canada. Americans living in dry counties also frequently cross county or state lines to purchase alcohol.\n\nMany Americans cross state lines to purchase cigarettes, crossing from a jurisdiction with very high cigarette taxes to a jurisdiction (such as another state or an Indian nation) with lower cigarette taxes. This occurs particularly in the Northeastern United States, where states levy among the highest tobacco taxes in the nation.\n\nSince the legalization of Cannabis in Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington state and Washington D.C, many drug tourists from states and countries where cannabis is illegal travel to these states to purchase cannabis and cannabis products.\n\nThe sale and possession of psilocin and psilocybin are prohibited under the federal health law of 1984. However, this prohibition is mostly unenforced against indigenous users of psilocybin mushrooms. As a result, the towns of Huautla de Jiménez and San José del Pacífico (both in the southern state of Oaxaca) have gained notoriety for their association with magic mushrooms, and constitute a safe haven even for non-indigenous users.\n\nIn South America, some tourists are attracted to Amazon basin villages to try a local liquid called ayahuasca which is a mixture of psychedelic plants that is used in traditional ceremonies. Similarly, tourists in Peru try hallucinogenic cactus called San Pedro which originally has been used by local tribes.\n\nIn Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and South Australia have a more liberal approach to cannabis use, promoting interstate drug tourism, particularly from Victoria and New South Wales. In addition, some areas of northern New South Wales have a liberal recreational drug culture, particularly areas around Nimbin where the annual MardiGrass festival is held. Discrete Local Guides may also be a source of plants\n\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20111029072110/http://nugmag.com/2011/09/tourist-coffee-shop-ban-not-in-amsterdam/ October 27, 2011\nhttp://drnights.com/ September 20, 2012\n"}
{"id": "10751250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10751250", "title": "Redistribution (cultural anthropology)", "text": "Redistribution (cultural anthropology)\n\nIn cultural anthropology and sociology, redistribution refers to a system of economic exchange involving the centralized collection of goods from members of a group followed by the redivision of those goods among those members. It is a form of reciprocity. Redistribution differs from simple reciprocity, which is a dyadic back-and-forth exchange between two parties. Redistribution, in contrast, consists of pooling, a system of reciprocities. It is a \"within\" group relationship, whereas reciprocity is a \"between\" relationship. Pooling establishes a centre, whereas reciprocity inevitably establishes two distinct parties with their own interests. While the most basic form of pooling is that of food within the family, it is also the basis for sustained community efforts under a political leader.\n\nSahlins argues that generalized reciprocity within families by elders may be a \"starting mechanism\" for more general hierarchy, by placing many in the giver's debt. This leads to the question, \"when does reciprocity give way to redistribution.\" Sahlins argues that chiefly redistribution is not different in principle and nothing but a highly organized form of kinship-rank reciprocity. Others, such as French Marxist anthropologist Claude Meillassoux, used the development of ranked kin redistribution from generalized reciprocity as the basis for a lineage mode of production found in western African chiefdoms and kingdoms.\nAn elaborate example of this in a non-market society is the potlatch, where large amounts of personal resources are ceremonially given away to others in the community according to social status, with the tacit expectation that other members of the community would themselves give away large amounts of their own property in the future.\n\nBähre argued that redistribution is a central mechanism in capitalist economies. In South Africa, many find themselves in a post-Fordist economy that is characterised by redistribution through the state (development aid, welfare), through markets (for example commercial insurance) and through religious institutions (neo-Pentecostal churches).\n\nIn modern mixed market economies, the central form of redistribution is facilitated through taxation by the state. Redistribution of property therefore occurs where properties are allocated back to individuals or groups within society either through the provision of public services or directly through welfare benefits.\n\n"}
{"id": "2286402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286402", "title": "Revolutionary Road", "text": "Revolutionary Road\n\nRevolutionary Road (released December 31, 1961) is author Richard Yates's debut novel. It was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1962 along with \"Catch-22\" and \"The Moviegoer\". When published by Atlantic-Little, Brown in 1961, it received critical acclaim, and \"The New York Times\" reviewed it as \"beautifully crafted... a remarkable and deeply troubling book.\" In 2005, the novel was chosen by \"TIME\" as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to the present.\n\nWhen DeWitt Henry and Geoffrey Clark interviewed Yates for the Winter 1972 issue of \"Ploughshares\", Yates detailed the title's subtext:\n\nA film adaptation, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, and Kathy Bates, directed by Sam Mendes and written by Justin Haythe, was released in 2008.\n\nSet in 1955, the novel focuses on the hopes and aspirations of Frank and April Wheeler, self-assured Connecticut suburbanites who see themselves as very different from their neighbors in the Revolutionary Hill Estates. In the opening scene, April stars in an embarrassingly bad amateur dramatic production of \"The Petrified Forest\":\n\nShe was working alone, and visibly weakening with every line. Before the end of the first act the audience could tell as well as the Players that she’d lost her grip, and soon they were all embarrassed for her. She had begun to alternate between false theatrical gestures and a white-knuckled immobility; she was carrying her shoulders high and square, and despite her heavy make-up you could see the warmth of humiliation rising in her face and neck.\n\nAfter the performance, Frank and April have a fight on the side of the highway, and Frank later begins an affair with his office colleague Maureen Grube.\n\nSeeking to break out of their suburban rut (and consequently blaming herself for all of Frank's \"problems\"), April convinces Frank they should move to Paris, where she will work and support him while he realizes his vague ambition to be something other than an office worker. The promise of France brings the two together in love and excitement again, and Frank seemingly ends his relationship with Maureen. While April sees the emigration as an opportunity to escape their dull environment, Frank's plans are more driven by vanity of his own intelligence, which April panders to. When the dull and prim neighbor Mrs. Givings begins bringing her \"insane\" son John around to the Wheelers' house for regular lunches, John's honest and erratic condemnation of his mother's suburban lifestyle strikes a chord with the Wheelers, particularly Frank.\n\nTheir plans to leave the United States begin to crumble when April conceives their third child, and Frank begins to identify with his mundane job when the prospect of a promotion arises. After arguing over the possibility of aborting the child, Frank tries to manipulate April into seeking psychiatric help for her troubled childhood. April, overwhelmed by the outcome of the situation, suffers something of an identity crisis and sleeps with her neighbor Shep Campbell, while Frank resurrects his relationship with Maureen. April attempts to self-abort her child, and in doing so is rushed to the hospital and dies from blood loss. Frank, scarred by the ordeal and feeling deep guilt over the outcome, is left a hollow shell of a man. He and his children spent time living with their uncle, hence mirroring the youth of their mother.\n\nIn the October 1999 issue of the \"Boston Review\", Yates was quoted on his central theme: \"If my work has a theme, I suspect it is a simple one: that most human beings are inescapably alone, and therein lies their tragedy.\" The Wheelers' frustrations and yearnings for something better represent the tattered remnants of the American Dream.\n\nStewart O'Nan probed the neglect of Yates in \"The Lost World of Richard Yates: How the Great Writer of the Age of Anxiety Disappeared from Print\".\nWilliam Styron, who once gave a reading of the novel's opening chapter at Boston University, called \"Revolutionary Road\" \"a deft, ironic, beautiful novel that deserves to be a classic.\"\n\nKurt Vonnegut called it \"\"The Great Gatsby\" of my time... one of the best books by a member of my generation.\"\n\nTennessee Williams also praised the book: \"Here is more than fine writing; here is what, added to fine writing, makes a book come immediately, intensely and brilliantly alive. If more is needed to make a masterpiece in modern American fiction, I am sure I don't know what it is.\"\n\nScreenwriter Justin Haythe adapted the novel for filming, which was directed by Sam Mendes, stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, and co-stars Kathy Bates. It opened December 26, 2008 to generally favorable reviews.\n\n"}

{"id": "62034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62034", "title": "Simone de Beauvoir", "text": "Simone de Beauvoir\n\nSimone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir (; ; 9 January 1908 – 14 April 1986) was a French writer, intellectual, existentialist philosopher, political activist, feminist and social theorist. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both feminist existentialism and feminist theory.\n\nDe Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and monographs on philosophy, politics and social issues. She was known for her 1949 treatise \"The Second Sex\", a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism; and for her novels, including \"She Came to Stay\" and \"The Mandarins\". She was also known for her lifelong relationship with French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nSimone de Beauvoir was born in Paris on 9 January 1908. Her parents were Georges Bertrand de Beauvoir, a legal secretary who once aspired to be an actor, and Françoise de Beauvoir (née Brasseur), a wealthy banker's daughter and devout Catholic. Simone's sister, Hélène, was born two years later. The family struggled to maintain their bourgeois status after losing much of their fortune shortly after World War I, and Françoise insisted that the two daughters be sent to a prestigious convent school. De Beauvoir herself was deeply religious as a child, at one point intending to become a nun. She lost her faith in her early teens and remained an atheist for the rest of her life.\n\nDe Beauvoir was intellectually precocious, fuelled by her father's encouragement; he reportedly would boast, \"Simone thinks like a man!\" Because of her family's straitened circumstances, de Beauvoir could no longer rely on her dowry, and like other middle-class girls of her age, her marriage opportunities were put at risk. De Beauvoir took this opportunity to do what she always wanted to do while also taking steps to earn a living for herself.\n\nAfter passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy in 1925, she studied mathematics at the Institut Catholique de Paris and literature/languages at the . She then studied philosophy at the Sorbonne and after completing her degree in 1928, she wrote her \"\" (roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) on Leibniz for Léon Brunschvicg (the topic was \"Le concept chez Leibniz\" [\"The Concept in Leibniz\"]). De Beauvoir was only the ninth woman to have received a degree from the Sorbonne at the time, due to the fact that French women had only recently been allowed to join higher education.\n\nDe Beauvoir first worked with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Claude Lévi-Strauss, when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled, she sat in on courses at the École Normale Supérieure in preparation for the \"agrégation\" in philosophy, a highly competitive postgraduate examination which serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for the \"agrégation\" that she met \"École Normale\" students Jean-Paul Sartre, Paul Nizan, and René Maheu (who gave her the lasting nickname \"Castor\", or beaver). The jury for the \"agrégation\" narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of de Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam.\n\nWriting of her youth in \"Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter\" she said:\n\"...my father's individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mother's teaching. This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual.\"\n\nFrom 1929 to 1943, de Beauvoir taught at the lycée level until she could support herself solely on the earnings of her writings. She taught at the (Marseille), the , the (1936–39).\n\nDuring October 1929, Jean-Paul Sartre and de Beauvoir became a couple and, after they were confronted by her father, Sartre asked her to marry him. One day while they were sitting on a bench outside the Louvre, he said, \"Let's sign a two-year lease\". Near the end of her life, de Beauvoir said, \"Marriage was impossible. I had no dowry.\" So they entered a lifelong relationship.\n\nSartre and de Beauvoir always read each other's work. Debate continues about the extent to which they influenced each other in their existentialist works, such as Sartre's \"Being and Nothingness\" and de Beauvoir's \"She Came to Stay\" and \"Phenomenology and Intent\". However, recent studies of de Beauvoir's work focus on influences other than Sartre, including Hegel and Leibniz. The Neo-Hegelian revival led by Alexandre Kojève and Jean Hyppolite in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Beauvoir and Sartre, to discover Hegel's \"Phenomenology of Spirit\".\n\nBeginning in 1929, de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre were partners for fifty-one years until his death in 1980. De Beauvoir chose never to marry or set up a joint household and she never had children. This gave her the time to advance her education and engage in political causes, to write and teach, and to have lovers.\n\nPerhaps her most famous lover was American author Nelson Algren whom she met in Chicago in 1947, and to whom she wrote across the Atlantic as \"my beloved husband.\" Algren won the National Book Award for \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" in 1950, and in 1954, de Beauvoir won France's most prestigious literary prize for \"The Mandarins\" in which Algren is the character Lewis Brogan. Algren vociferously objected to their intimacy becoming public. Years after they separated, she was buried wearing his gift of a silver ring. However, she lived with Claude Lanzmann from 1952 to 1959.\n\nDe Beauvoir was bisexual and her relationships with young women were controversial. Former student Bianca Lamblin (originally Bianca Bienenfeld) wrote in her book \"Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée\" (English: \"Memoirs of a Disturbed Young Lady\"), that, while she was a student at Lycée Molière, she had been sexually exploited by her teacher de Beauvoir, who was in her 30s at the time. In 1943, de Beauvoir was suspended from her teaching job, due to an accusation that she had seduced her 17-year-old lycée pupil Natalie Sorokine in 1939. Sorokine's parents laid formal charges against de Beauvoir for debauching a minor and as a result she had her license to teach in France permanently revoked.\n\nIn 1977, de Beauvoir, Sartre, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and much of the era's intelligentsia signed a petition seeking to abrogate the age of consent in France.\n\nDe Beauvoir published her first novel \"She Came to Stay\" in 1943. It is a fictionalised chronicle of her and Sartre's sexual relationship with Olga Kosakiewicz and Wanda Kosakiewicz. Olga was one of her students in the Rouen secondary school where de Beauvoir taught during the early 1930s. She grew fond of Olga. Sartre tried to pursue Olga but she rejected him, so he began a relationship with her sister Wanda. Upon his death, Sartre was still supporting Wanda. He also supported Olga for years, until she met and married Jacques-Laurent Bost, a lover of de Beauvoir.\n\nIn the novel, set just before the outbreak of World War II, de Beauvoir creates one character from the complex relationships of Olga and Wanda. The fictionalised versions of Beauvoir and Sartre have a ménage à trois with the young woman. The novel also delves into de Beauvoir and Sartre's complex relationship and how it was affected by the ménage à trois.\n\n\"She Came to Stay\" was followed by many others, including \"The Blood of Others\", which explores the nature of individual responsibility, telling a love story between two young French students participating in the Resistance in World War II.\n\nIn 1944 de Beauvoir wrote her first philosophical essay, \"Pyrrhus et Cinéas\", a discussion of an existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay \"The Ethics of Ambiguity\" (1947); it is perhaps the most accessible entry into French existentialism. In the essay, de Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many, Sartre included, have found in major existentialist works such as \"Being and Nothingness\". In \"The Ethics of Ambiguity\", de Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.\n\nAt the end of World War II, de Beauvoir and Sartre edited \"Les Temps modernes\", a political journal which Sartre founded along with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and others. De Beauvoir used \"Les Temps Modernes\" to promote her own work and explore her ideas on a small scale before fashioning essays and books. De Beauvoir remained an editor until her death.\n\n\"The Second Sex\", first published in 1949 in French as \"Le Deuxième Sexe\", turns the existentialist mantra that \"existence precedes essence\" into a feminist one: \"One is not born but becomes a woman\". With this famous phrase, Beauvoir first articulated what has come to be known as the sex-gender distinction, that is, the distinction between biological sex and the social and historical construction of gender and its attendant stereotypes. \"The fundamental source of women's oppression\" Beauvoir notes, \"is its historical and social construction as the quintessential\" Other.\n\nDe Beauvoir defines women as the \"second sex\" because women are defined in relation to men. Aristotle referred that women are \"female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities\". De Beauvoir also points out that St. Thomas referred to the woman as the \"imperfect man\", the \"incidental\" being. De Beauvoir asserted that women are as capable of choice as men, and thus can choose to elevate themselves, moving beyond the 'immanence' to which they were previously resigned and reaching 'transcendence', a position in which one takes responsibility for oneself and the world, where one chooses one's freedom.\n\nChapters of \"The Second Sex\" were originally published in \"Les Temps modernes\", in June 1949. The second volume came a few months after the first in France. It was very quickly published in America due to the quick translation by Howard Parshley, as prompted by Blanche Knopf, wife of publisher Alfred A. Knopf. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language, and a minimal understanding of philosophy (he was a professor of biology at Smith College), much of de Beauvoir's book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut, distorting her intended message. For years, Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of de Beauvoir's work, declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars. Only in 2009 was there a second translation, to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010, reinstating a third of the original work.\n\nIn the chapter \"Woman: Myth and Reality\" of \"The Second Sex\", de Beauvoir argued that men had made women the \"Other\" in society by application of a false aura of \"mystery\" around them. She argued that men used this as an excuse not to understand women or their problems and not to help them, and that this stereotyping was always done in societies by the group higher in the hierarchy to the group lower in the hierarchy. She wrote that a similar kind of oppression by hierarchy also happened in other categories of identity, such as race, class and religion, but she claimed that it was nowhere more true than with gender in which men stereotyped women and used it as an excuse to organize society into a patriarchy.\n\nDespite her contributions to the feminist movement, especially the French women's liberation movement, and her beliefs in women's economic independence and equal education, de Beauvoir was initially reluctant to call herself a feminist. However, after observing the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, de Beauvoir stated she no longer believed a socialist revolution to be enough to bring about women's liberation. She publicly declared herself a feminist in 1972 in an interview with \"Le Nouvel Observateur\".\n\nIn 2018 the manuscript pages of \"Le Deuxième Sexe\" were published. At the time her adopted daughter, Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir, a philosophy professor, described her mother's writing process: Beauvoir wrote every page of her books longhand first and only after hired typists.\n\nPublished in 1954, \"The Mandarins\" is set after the end of World War II and won her France's highest literary prize, the \"Prix Goncourt\". The book follows the personal lives of philosophers and friends among Sartre's and de Beauvoir's intimate circle, including her relationship with American writer Nelson Algren, to whom the book was dedicated. Algren was outraged by the frank way de Beauvoir described their sexual experiences in both \"The Mandarins\" and her autobiographies. Algren vented his outrage when reviewing American translations of de Beauvoir's work. Much material bearing on this episode in de Beauvoir's life, including her love letters to Algren, entered the public domain only after her death.\n\nDe Beauvoir wrote popular travel diaries about time spent in the United States and China and published essays and fiction rigorously, especially throughout the 1950s and 1960s. She published several volumes of short stories, including \"The Woman Destroyed\", which, like some of her other later work, deals with aging.\n\n1980 saw the publication of \"When Things of the Spirit Come First\", a set of short stories centred around and based upon women important to her earlier years. Though written long before the novel \"She Came to Stay\", de Beauvoir did not at the time consider the stories worth publishing, allowing some forty years to pass before doing so.\n\nSartre and Merleau-Ponty had a longstanding feud, which led Merleau-Ponty to leave \"Les Temps Modernes\". De Beauvoir sided with Sartre and ceased to associate with Merleau-Ponty. In de Beauvoir's later years, she hosted the journal's editorial meetings in her flat and contributed more than Sartre, whom she often had to force to offer his opinions.\n\nDe Beauvoir also notably wrote a four-volume autobiography, consisting of: \"Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter\"; \"The Prime of Life\"; \"Force of Circumstance\" (sometimes published in two volumes in English translation: \"After the War\" and \"Hard Times\"); and \"All Said and Done\".\n\nIn the 1970s de Beauvoir became active in France's women's liberation movement. She wrote and signed the Manifesto of the 343 in 1971, a manifesto that included a list of famous women who claimed to have had an abortion, then illegal in France. Some argue most of the women had not had abortions, including Beauvoir. Signatories were diverse as Catherine Deneuve, Delphine Seyrig and de Beauvoir's sister Poupette. In 1974, abortion was legalised in France.\n\nHer 1970 long essay La Vieillesse (\"The Coming of Age\") is a rare instance of an intellectual meditation on the decline and solitude all humans experience if they do not die before about the age of 60.\n\nIn an interview with Betty Friedan, de Beauvoir said: \"No, we don’t believe that any woman should have this choice. No woman should be authorised to stay at home to bring up her children. Society should be totally different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one. It is a way of forcing women in a certain direction.\"\n\nIn about 1976 de Beauvoir and Sylvie Le Bon made a trip to New York City in the United States to visit Kate Millett on her farm.\nIn 1981 she wrote \"La Cérémonie Des Adieux\" (\"A Farewell to Sartre\"), a painful account of Sartre's last years. In the opening of \"Adieux\", de Beauvoir notes that it is the only major published work of hers which Sartre did not read before its publication.\n\nShe contributed the piece \"Feminism – alive, well, and in constant danger\" to the 1984 anthology \"\", edited by Robin Morgan.\n\nAfter Sartre died in 1980, de Beauvoir published his letters to her with edits to spare the feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After de Beauvoir's death, Sartre's adopted daughter and literary heir Arlette Elkaïm would not let many of Sartre's letters be published in unedited form. Most of Sartre's letters available today have de Beauvoir's edits, which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms. De Beauvoir's adopted daughter and literary heir Sylvie Le Bon, unlike Elkaïm, published de Beauvoir's unedited letters to both Sartre and Algren.\n\nDe Beauvoir died of pneumonia on 14 April 1986 in Paris, aged 78. She is buried next to Sartre at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The amount involved ranges from 10 to 100 percent of the standard accommodation rate. Solo travelers see this as an unfair form of discrimination, but vendors justify the charge as reflecting the fact that most accommodations are priced for double occupancy.\n\nDiscounts for booking early or repeat bookings and programs that arrange shared accommodation are variations on pricing that can ameliorate the single supplement for solo travelers. Research prior to travel may find companies that have removed the single supplement.\n\nIn 2013, around 12 percent of American adults planned to travel solo that year.\n\nVendors and agents in the travel industry quote package-deal and accommodation prices in terms of dollars per person when the customer travels in a group of two, that is, \"twin share\" or \"double\". The single supplement is a premium surcharge applied to a traveler who travels alone but will use a room that caters for two.\n\nAccommodation vendors argue that solo travelers should expect to pay for the luxury and convenience of having a room to themselves. Vendors also expect to be compensated for the cost of preparing a room for a guest, in cleaning and providing disposables, when only one person will be charged.\n\nThe solo traveler argues that traveling alone is often a necessity rather than a luxury and that the cost of preparing rooms for guests should be distributed among customers without discrimination, or (more extremely) that couples should be surcharged for the privilege of not having to sleep apart.\n\nThose affected may choose an accommodation vendor or tour operator which caters specifically for the solo traveler. Singles networks may assist in finding a compatible travel companion.\n\nObjections to the single supplement may be partly explained by the \"framing effect\" described by Nagle and Holden in 2002. This effect occurs when customers see cost as a combination of gains and losses. Take as example, a hotel room advertised at #£300, with a £25 discount for early booking and compare it with the same room at #£250, with a 10% single person surcharge. Customers will tend to choose the arrangement even though the cost of £275, is the same. Customers tend to choose gains over losses. An early booking discount is seen a gain, whereas a surcharge is seen as a loss.\n\n"}
{"id": "29462586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29462586", "title": "Spiritual death", "text": "Spiritual death\n\nThe concept of spiritual death has varying meanings in various uses and contexts. \"Spiritually dead\" person may mean someone who is not spiritual (materialist, atheist) - one, who identifies himself with dead matter, though he is a living conscious being. Thus first meaning for \"spiritual death\" is \"to become atheist\". Another, narrow, \"purified\" meaning of \"spiritual death\" is \"death in a spiritual way\", \"to die being a spiritual person, not being an atheist\". Thus this means that \"spiritual death\" relates to two egos: soul (real self, which is eternal), and ego (false self, which is temporary or material). Difference in meanings come from misidentification of eternal soul to be \"spiritually dead\" or \"material\", which is nonsense for theist. For theist there is no such thing as \"spiritual death\". Matter can be only dead, and soul can only be eternal. As put by the LDS Church, \"the body is as a glove, and the spirit the hand that moves\". One cannot say \"dead life\", or \"alive death\". For contrast you can guess what is the meaning of \"material life: life is always spiritual, though \"material life\" would mean just \"to live having materialistic values\".\n\nBuddhadasa called Dukkha Spiritual Death.\nSangharakshita uses the term Spiritual Death to describe one stage in a system of meditation, where insight is gained into delusions about our existence.\n\nFollowers of Ascended Master movements such as the Theosophical Society, I AM Foundation, and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have a different definition of the second death: The final extinguishing of the identity of a soul deemed by God to be beyond redemption. In this theology, people are believed to continue to reincarnate for many lifetimes on Earth with one of two final outcomes: 1) Reunion with God in the ritual of the Ascension, like Jesus, or 2) Final judgment at the \"court of the sacred fire,\" where the soul would be destroyed forever. The Unification Church teaches that spiritual death is the state of separation from God, but that it is not ever irreversible. Spiritual death (death for spiritual person, not for atheist) is the art of learning to die. It is only through this art that the consciousness of death of oneself (the self or ego that is afraid to die) is transformed into consciousness of the eternally new or young self or soul (the self or soul that accepts death for body, but never for soul him/herself, as soul is eternal).\n\nDr. John B. Calhoun saw the social breakdown of a population of mice given ample resources as a second death. He saw this as a metaphor for the potential fate of man in an overcrowded but resource rich environment and made reference to the second death of the Book of Revelation. Conservative Christian writers, such as Bill Perkins, have echoed this warning.\n\nIn his famous anti-war address \"Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence,\" delivered 4 April 1967 at a meeting of Clergy and Laity Concerned at Riverside Church in New York City, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. observed that \"[a] nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2688034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2688034", "title": "Standing on the shoulders of giants", "text": "Standing on the shoulders of giants\n\nThe metaphor of dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants () expresses the meaning of \"discovering truth by building on previous discoveries\". This concept has been traced to the 12th century, attributed to Bernard of Chartres. Its most familiar expression in English is by Isaac Newton in 1675: \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.\"\n\nThe attribution to Bernard of Chartres is due to John of Salisbury. In 1159, John wrote in his \"Metalogicon\": \"Bernard of Chartres used to compare us to dwarfs perched on the shoulders of giants. He pointed out that we see more and farther than our predecessors, not because we have keener vision or greater height, but because we are lifted up and borne aloft on their gigantic stature.\" \n\nAccording to medieval historian Richard William Southern, Bernard was comparing contemporary 12th century scholars to the ancient scholars of Greece and Rome:\n\n[The phrase] sums up the quality of the cathedral schools in the history of learning, and indeed characterizes the age which opened with Gerbert (950–1003) and Fulbert (960–1028) and closed in the first quarter of the 12th century with Peter Abelard. [The phrase] is not a great claim; neither, however, is it an example of abasement before the shrine of antiquity. It is a very shrewd and just remark, and the important and original point was the dwarf \"could\" see a little further than the giant. That this was possible was above all due to the cathedral schools with their lack of a well-rooted tradition and their freedom from a clearly defined routine of study.\n\nThe phrase also appears in the works of the Jewish tosaphist Isaiah di Trani (c. 1180 – c. 1250):\n\nShould Joshua the son of Nun endorse a mistaken position, I would reject it out of hand, I do not hesitate to express my opinion, regarding such matters in accordance with the modicum of intelligence allotted to me. I was never arrogant claiming \"My Wisdom served me well\". Instead I applied to myself the parable of the philosophers. For I heard the following from the philosophers, The wisest of the philosophers was asked: \"We admit that our predecessors were wiser than we. At the same time we criticize their comments, often rejecting them and claiming that the truth rests with us. How is this possible?\" The wise philosopher responded: \"Who sees further a dwarf or a giant? Surely a giant for his eyes are situated at a higher level than those of the dwarf. But if the dwarf is placed on the shoulders of the giant who sees further? ... So too we are dwarfs astride the shoulders of giants. We master their wisdom and move beyond it. Due to their wisdom we grow wise and are able to say all that we say, but not because we are greater than they.\n\nDiego de Estella took up the quote in the 16th century; by the 17th century it had become commonplace. Robert Burton, in \"The Anatomy of Melancholy\" (1621), quotes Stella thus:\nI say with Didacus Stella, a dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant may see farther than a giant himself.\nLater editors of Burton misattributed the quote to Lucan; in their hands Burton's attribution \"Didacus Stella, in luc 10, tom. ii\" \"Didacus on the Gospel of \"Luke\", chapter 10; volume 2\" became a reference to Lucan's \"Pharsalia\" 2.10. No reference or allusion to the quote is found there.\n\nLater in the 17th century, George Herbert, in his \"Jacula Prudentum\" (1651), wrote \"A dwarf on a giant's shoulders sees farther of the two.\"\n\nIsaac Newton remarked in a letter to his rival Robert Hooke dated February 5, 1676 [O.S.] (February 15, 1676 [N.S.]) that:\nWhat Des-Cartes did was a good step. You have added much several ways, & especially in taking the colours of thin plates into philosophical consideration. If I have seen further it is by standing on the sholders of Giants.\nThis has recently been interpreted by a few writers as a sarcastic remark directed at Hooke's appearance. Although Hooke was not of particularly short stature, he was of slight build and had been afflicted from his youth with a severe kyphosis. However, at this time Hooke and Newton were on good terms and had exchanged many letters in tones of mutual regard. Only later, when Robert Hooke criticized some of Newton's ideas regarding optics, was Newton so offended that he withdrew from public debate. The two men remained enemies until Hooke's death.\n\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge, in \"The Friend\" (1828), wrote:\nThe dwarf sees farther than the giant, when he has the giant's shoulder to mount on.\nAgainst this notion, Friedrich Nietzsche argues that a dwarf (the academic scholar) brings even the most sublime heights down to his level of understanding. In the section of \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" (1882) entitled \"On the Vision and the Riddle\", Zarathustra climbs to great heights with a dwarf on his shoulders to show him his greatest thought. Once there however, the dwarf fails to understand the profundity of the vision and Zarathustra reproaches him for \"making things too easy on [him]self.\" If there is to be anything resembling \"progress\" in the history of philosophy, Nietzsche in \"Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks\" (1873) writes, it can only come from those rare giants among men, \"each giant calling to his brother through the desolate intervals of time,\" an idea he got from Schopenhauer's work in \"Der handschriftliche Nachlass\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1076499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1076499", "title": "Student exchange program", "text": "Student exchange program\n\nA student exchange program is a program in which students from a secondary school or university study abroad at one of their institution's partner institutions.\n\nA student exchange program may involve international travel, but does not necessarily require the student to study outside their home country.\n\nForeign exchange programs provide students with an opportunity to study in a different country and environment experiencing the history and culture of another country.\n\nThe term \"exchange\" means that a partner institution accepts a student, but does not necessarily mean that the students have to find a counterpart from the other institution with whom to exchange. Exchange students live with a host family or in a designated place such as a hostel, an apartment, or a student lodging. Costs for the program vary by the country and institution. Participants fund their participation via scholarships, loans, or self-funding.\n\nStudent exchanges became popular after World War II, and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Student exchanges also increased further after the end of the Cold War. An exchange student typically stays in the host country for a period of 6 to 10 months. International students or those on study abroad programs may stay in the host country for several years. Some exchange programs also offer academic credit.\n\nA short-term exchange program is also known as summer/intensive or cultural exchange program. These focus on homestays, language skills, community service, or cultural activities. High school and university students can apply for the programs through various government or non-governmental organizations that organize the programs. A short-term exchange lasts from one week to three months and doesn’t require the student to study in any particular school or institution. The students are exposed to an intensive program that increases their understanding of other cultures, communities, and languages.\n\nA long-term exchange is one which lasts six to ten months or up to one full year. Participants attend high school in their host countries, through a student visa. Typically, guest students coming to the United States are issued a J-1 cultural exchange visa or an F-1 foreign student visa. Students are expected to integrate themselves into the host family, immersing themselves in the local community and surroundings. Upon their return to their home country they are expected to incorporate this knowledge into their daily lives, as well as give a presentation on their experience to their sponsors. Many exchange programs expect students to be able converse in the language of the host country, at least on a basic level. Some programs require students to pass a standardized test for English language comprehension prior to being accepted into a program taking them to the United States. Other programs do not examine language ability. Most exchange students become fluent in the language of the host country within a few months. Some exchange programs, such as the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange, are government-funded programs.\n\nThe Council on Standards for International Educational Travel is a not-for-profit organization committed to quality international educational travel and exchange for youth at the high school level.\n\nLong-term (10 to 12 month) exchange applications and interviews generally take place 10 months in advance of departure, but sometimes as little as four months. Students generally must be between the ages of 15 and 18.5. Some programs allow students older than 18 years of age in a specialized work-study program.\n\nSome programs require a preliminary application form with fees, and then schedule interviews and a longer application form. Other programs request a full application from the beginning and then schedule interviews. High school scholarship programs often require a set GPA of around 3.0 or higher. Programs select the candidates most likely to complete the program and serve as the best ambassadors to the foreign nation. Students in some programs, such as Rotary, are expected to go to any location where the organization places them, and students are encouraged not to have strict expectations of their host country. Students are allowed to choose a country, but may live at any spot within that country.\n\nThe home country organization will contact a partner organization in the country of the student’s choice. Students accepted for the program may or may not be screened by the organization in their home country. Partner organizations in the destination country each have differing levels of screening they require students to pass through before being accepted into their program. For example, students coming to the U.S. may be allowed to come on the recommendation of the organization in their home country, or the hosting partner may require the student to submit a detailed application, including previous school report cards, letters from teachers and administrators, and standardized English fluency exam papers. The U.S. agency may then accept or decline the applicant. Some organizations also have Rules of Participation. For example, almost all U.S. organizations cannot allow an exchange student to drive an automobile during their visit. Some organizations require a written contract that sets standards for personal behavior and grades, while others may be less rigorous. Lower cost programs can result in a student participating without a supervisor being available nearby to check on the student's well-being. Programs provided by agencies that provide compensation for representatives are more likely to retain local representatives to assist and guide the student and keep track of their well-being.\n\nThe costs of student exchange are determined by the charges from a student exchange program organisation or the university or college. The costs vary depending on the country, length of study and other personal factors. Different programs through the school/university of choice may offer students scholarships that cover the expenses of travel and accommodation and the personal needs of a student.\n\nEach state in Australia provides a different program of student exchange for secondary students. The programmes from each state are different for whether a student in Australia is looking to study internationally or a student from another country is looking to study in Australia. Student exchange in Australia, depending on the state, must be managed by registered exchange organisations or the school chosen for study must be registered. The countries that are most popular for Australian students to choose to study are, Japan, France, Germany, USA, Italy, Canada, Belgium, Spain and Argentina. The main purpose of student exchange in Australia is to allow students to study, engage and experience a new culture. International students who choose to study in Australia are given different opportunities through the programmes at set schools will learn about Australian culture, but also gain English language skills at a high school level.\n\nExchange programs for University students to study abroad varies depending on the university campus offers. International student exchange programs for university students is aimed to enhance students intercultural skills and knowledge. Student exchange programs for University students gives the opportunity to broaden their knowledge on their study of choice from a different country, this gives university students a chance to develop their work experience by seeing how the profession they are studying is practised in another country. International exchange for tertiary students allows them to gain a cultural experience on their studies, but also giving them a change to travel abroad while completing their degree.\n\nA series of studies conducted within the last decade found similar results in students studying abroad in Spain for a short-term and/or semester long program. These studies found that students can improve their speaking proficiency during one semester, there is a positive relationship between students’ integrative motivation and interaction with second language culture, and student contact with the Spanish language has a great effect on their speaking improvement. We especially see these results in students who live with host families during their program. Anne Reynolds-Case found improvements in understanding and usage of the \"vosotros\" form after studying in Spain. One study specifically studies culture perceptions of students studying abroad in Spain. Alan Meredith defines culture as consisting “of patterns, explicit and implicit, of and for behavior acquired and transmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievement of human groups, including their embodiments in artifacts.” Questionnaires were given to students living with host families during a two-month program in Spain. He studies how these groups perceive customs, such as concern for personal appearance, physical contact, cooking styles, politics, etc. The study found a variety of results depending the cultural custom. However, the American students’ perceptions most closely aligned with the Young Spaniards (16–22 years old). At the same time, Angela George’s study found little significance in the adoption of regional features during their semester abroad. Though most of these studies focused on students who came from America to study in Spain, the United States is not the only one sending their students. Brian Denman’s article demonstrates an increase of Saudi student mobility for education, including locations such as Spain.\n\nEven though exchange students learn to improve themselves through the experience of studying and staying in another country, there are also many difficulties to be encountered. One of them is when exchange students are unable to adapt to pedagogy followed by the host country. Another is conflicts between the host family (who have provided accommodation) and the students, when it can not be solved by communicating with each other and the student usually will be asked to stay with another host until they find a new match. This process, however, could take time while the students' duration of stay is limited. Even with preparation and knowledge about the new environment, they could still experience culture shock, which can affect them in different ways. Students from a completely different culture can also encounter homesickness for a longer period of time. Lack of transportation can also become a major problem, because the chances students buying a car during a short period of stay is less likely to happen. Moreover, students will find it hard to find a job, even part-time since most exchange visas do not allow students to work and it is difficult to obtain one that does.\nAnother potential drawback is health issues that can occur during the stay in a foreign country. All students are encouraged to consult a travel health expert, and be up to date with their vaccinations. Always have health insurance while traveling abroad, and carry emergency contact details of your local hosts and of multiple family members as well.\n\n\n"}

They are frequently listed among the greatest films of all time and are often cited as the greatest movies in the history of Indian cinema. The original music for the films was composed by Ravi Shankar.\n\nThey are based on two Bengali novels written by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay: \"Pather Panchali\" (1929) and \"Aparajito\" (1932). The three films went on to win many national and international awards, including three National Film Awards and seven awards from the Cannes, Berlin and Venice Film Festivals. Produced on a shoestring budget (\"Pather Panchali\" had a budget of roughly 150,000 ($45,300—)) using an amateur cast and crew, the trilogy is a milestone in Indian cinema and remains one of the most acclaimed works in the Parallel Cinema movement.\n\nThe three films comprise a \"coming of age\" narrative in the vein of a \"bildungsroman\"; they describe the childhood, education and early maturity of a young Bengali named Apu (Apurba Kumar Roy) in the early part of the 20th century.\n\nPather Panchali (Bengali, \"Song of the Little Road\")<br>\nApu's early experiences in rural Bengal as the son of a poor but high caste family are presented. Apu's father Harihar, a Brahmin, has difficulty in supporting his family. After the death of Apu's sister, Durga, the family moves to the holy city of Benares.\n\nAparajito (Bengali, \"The Unvanquished\")<br>\nThe family's finances are still precarious. After his father dies there, Apu and his mother Sarbajaya come back to a village in Bengal. Despite unrelenting poverty, Apu manages to get formal schooling and turns out to be a brilliant student. The growing Apu comes into conflict with his mother. Later, when his mother dies too, he has to learn to live alone.\n\nApur Sansar (Bengali, \"The World of Apu\")<br>\nAttempting to become a writer, Apu unexpectedly finds himself pressured to marry a girl whose mother rejected her mentally ill bridegroom on the day of their wedding. Their blossoming marriage ends in her death in childbirth, after which the despairing Apu abandons his child, but eventually returns to accept his responsibilities.\n\nIn 1950, Ray had decided that \"Pather Panchali\", the classic coming of age story (bildungsroman) of Bengali literature, published in 1928 by Bibhutibhusan Bandopadhyay, would be the subject matter for his first film. This semi-autobiographical novel describes the growing up of Apu, a small boy in a Bengal village. He went ahead with the film after meeting Jean Renoir during filming of \"The River\" (1951) and after watching the Italian neorealist film \"Bicycle Thieves\" (1948) while he was in London. Besides the influence of European cinema and Bengali literature, Ray is also indebted to the Indian theatrical tradition, particularly the \"rasa\" theory of classical Sanskrit drama. The complicated doctrine of \"rasa\" centers predominantly on feelings experienced not only by the characters but also conveyed in a certain artistic way to the spectator. The duality of \"rasa\" representation shows in \"The Apu Trilogy\".\n\nRay gathered an inexperienced crew, although both his cameraman Subrata Mitra and art director Bansi Chandragupta went on to achieve great acclaim. The cast consisted of mostly amateur artists. Shooting started in late 1952, using Ray's personal savings. He had hoped that once the initial shots had been completed, he would be able to obtain funds to support the project; however, such funding was not forthcoming. \"Pather Panchali\" was shot over the unusually long period of three years, because shooting was possible only from time to time, when Ray or production manager Anil Chowdhury could arrange further money. With a loan from the West Bengal government, the film was finally completed and released in 1955 to great critical and popular success, sweeping up numerous prizes and having long runs in both India and abroad. During the making of the film, Ray refused funding from sources who demanded a change in script or the supervision of the producer, and he ignored advice from the government (which finally funded the film anyway) to incorporate a happy ending in having Apu's family join a \"development project\". Even greater help than Renoir's encouragement occurred when Ray showed a sequence to John Huston who was in India scouting locations for \"The Man Who Would Be King\". The sequence is the remarkable vision Apu and his sister have of the train running through the countryside. It was the only sequence Ray had filmed due to his small budget. Huston praised Ray to Monroe Wheeler at the New York Museum of Modern Art, saying that a major talent was on the horizon.\n\nIn India, the reaction to the film was enthusiastic; \"The Times of India\" wrote that \"It is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema [...]. \"Pather Panchali\" is pure cinema\". In the United Kingdom, Lindsay Anderson wrote a glowing review of the film. However, the reaction was not uniformly positive. After watching the movie, François Truffaut is reported to have said, \"I don't want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands.\" Bosley Crowther, then the most influential critic of \"The New York Times\", wrote a mixed review of the film that its distributor Ed Harrison thought would kill off the film when it got released in the United States; however, it enjoyed an exceptionally long run.\n\nRay's international career started in earnest after the success of his next film, \"Aparajito\" (\"The Unvanquished\"). This film shows the eternal struggle between the ambitions of Apu as a young man and the mother who loves him. Some critics, notably Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak, rank it even higher than the first film. Aparajito won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. The film is also notable for introducing the technique of bounce lighting to recreate the effect of daylight on sets, pioneered by the cinematographer Subrata Mitra.\n\nRay had not thought about a trilogy while making \"Aparajito\", and it occurred to him only after being asked about the idea in Venice. The final installation of the series, \"Apur Sansar\" (\"The World of Apu\"), was made in 1959. A number of critics find this to be the supreme achievement of the trilogy (Robin Wood, Aparna Sen). Ray introduced two of his favourite actors, Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore, in this film. The film finds Apu living in a nondescript Kolkata house in near-poverty. He becomes involved in an unusual marriage with Aparna, the scenes of their life together forming \"one of the cinema's classic affirmative depiction of married life\", but tragedy ensues. After \"Apur Sansar\" was harshly criticised by a Bengali critic, Ray wrote an article defending it—a rare event in Ray's filmmaking career (the other major instance involved the film \"Charulata\", Ray's personal favourite). His success had little influence on his personal life in the years to come. Ray continued to live with his mother, uncle and other members of his extended family in a rented house.\n\nThis trilogy is considered by critics around the globe to rank among the greatest achievements of Indian film, and it is established as one of the most historically important cinematic debuts. \"Pather Panchali\" won at least thirteen international prizes (including Best Human Document at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival), followed by eleven international prizes for \"Aparajito\" (including the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival) and numerous other awards for \"Apur Sansar\" (including the Sutherland Trophy at the London Film Festival). When Ray made \"Pather Panchali\", he worked with a cast and crew most of whom had never been previously involved in film. Ray himself at the time of directing \"Pather Panchali\" had primarily worked in the advertising industry, although he had served as assistant director on Jean Renoir's 1951 film \"The River\". From this foundation, Ray went on to create other highly acclaimed films, like \"Charulata\", \"Mahanagar\", and \"Aranyer Dinratri\", and his international success energised other Bengal filmmakers like Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak.\nThis extract from \"Youth\", by South African author J.

Director Kaushik Ganguly won the award of best director for \"Apur Panchali\" in the 44th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in November 2013. The director mentioned in an interview that he found similarities between certain parts of the life of Subir Banerjee and the iconic character Apu. In the film actor Parambrata Chatterjee portrays a younger Subir Banerjee, while Ardhendu Bannerjee plays the role of the aged Banerjee.\n\nAccording to Michael Sragow of \"The Atlantic Monthly\" in 1994:\n\nAcross the world, filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, James Ivory, Abbas Kiarostami, Elia Kazan, Carlos Saura, Isao Takahata, Philip Kaufman, Wes Anderson and Danny Boyle have been influenced by \"The Apu Trilogy\", with many others such as Akira Kurosawa praising the work. In Gregory Nava's 1995 film \"My Family\", the final scene is duplicated from the final scene of \"Apur Sansar\". Similar influences and references to the trilogy can be found, for example, in recent works such as \"Sacred Evil\", Key's 2004 visual novel \"Clannad\", Paul Auster's 2008 novel \"Man in the Dark\", the \"Elements trilogy\" of Deepa Mehta and even in films of Jean-Luc Godard. The technique of bounce lighting pioneered by Subrata Mitra, to recreate the effect of daylight on sets, has also had a profound influence on the development of cinematography. Ravi Shankar's soundtracks to the films were also a major influence on The Beatles, specifically George Harrison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The musical performances of Waiora are centred upon the ancient cultural practices of the Maori people and their musical instruments commonly referred to as Taonga Pūoro. Their performances combine elements of traditional war dances or haka, melodic songs with lyrics written in the Maori language, and instrumental music that fuses the mystical sounds of taonga pūoro with guitar and percussive instruments from around the globe.\n\nWhen the group was formed in early 2013 Waiora was originally a duo with the founding members being Horomona Horo and Joshua Henare Rogers. In March 2014 Korey Atama joined the group just before Waiora's performance at WOMAD Taranaki.\n\nHistorically the concept of Waiora was formed many years earlier in 2002 at a taonga pūoro workshop held at the Heitiki Art Gallery in Rotorua, New Zealand. Taonga pūoro expert Richard Nunns and his protegé Horomona Horo were tutoring the workshop. Classical guitarist Joshua Henare Rogers had decided to attend the workshop to learn more about the instruments to help with his composition of the seminal opus for taonga puūoro and classical guitar 'He Karanga Ki Te Ao' premiered three years later in Whakatane.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "700677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=700677", "title": "Zaza language", "text": "Zaza language\n\nZaza language, also called Zazaki, Kirmanjki and Dimli, is an Indo-European language spoken primarily in eastern Turkey by the Zazas. The language is a part of the northwestern group of the Iranian section of the Indo-European family, and belongs to the Zaza–Gorani and Caspian dialect group. Zaza shares many features, structures, and vocabulary with Gorani (Hawrami), Shabaki, Bajelani and Sarli, because all this languages belongs to the subgroup Zaza-Gorani. Zaza also has some similarities with Talyshi and other Caspian languages. According to Ethnologue (which cites [Paul 1998]), the number of speakers is between 1.5 and 2.5 million (including all dialects). According to Nevins, the number of Zaza speakers is between 2 and 4 million.\n\nZaza belongs to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. From the point of view of the spoken language, its closest relatives are Gilaki, Mazandarani, Hewrami and other Caspian languages. The closest languages are genetically Hewrami and due to long-lasting influence Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish). However, the classification of Zaza has been an issue of political discussion. It is sometimes classified as a subdialect of Kurdish. The majority of Zaza-speakers in Turkey identify themselves as ethnic Kurds.\n\nZaza appears to be a pejorative name designating the language as a form of jibberish evident that its speakers designate their language as \"Dimlī\" or \"Kirmānd̲j̲kī.\"\n\nThe US State Department \"Background Note\" lists the Zaza language as one of the major languages of Turkey, along with Turkish (official), Kurdish, Armenian, Greek, and Arabic.\nLinguists connect the word Dimli with the Daylamites in the Alborz Mountains near the shores of the Caspian Sea in Iran and believe that the Zazas have immigrated from Deylaman towards the west. Zaza shows many connections to the Iranian languages of the Caspian region, especially the Gilaki language.\n\nThe Zaza language shows similarities with Gorani (or Hawrami), Shabaki, Bajelani and Sarli. However, it also shows many similarities with Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish), which it does not share with Caspian languages, Hewrami or other Kurdish languages:\nThe Gorani, Bajelani, and Shabaki languages are spoken around the Iran-Iraq border; however, it is believed that speakers of these languages also migrated from Northern Iran to their present homelands. These languages are classified together in the Zaza–Gorani language group.\n\nThere are three main Zaza dialects:\nIts subdialects are:\nIts subdialects are:\nIts subdialects are:\n\nThe first written statements in Zaza were compiled by the linguist Peter Lerch in 1850. Two other important documents are the religious writings of Ehmedê Xasî of 1899, and of Osman Efendîyo Babij (published in Damascus in 1933 by Celadet Bedir Khan); both of these works were written in the Arabic script.\n\nThe use of the Latin script to write Zaza became popular only in the diaspora in Sweden, France and Germany at the beginning of the 1980s. This was followed by the publication of magazines and books in Turkey, particularly in Istanbul. The efforts of Zaza intellectuals to advance the comprehensibility of their native language by using that alphabet helped the number of publications in Zaza multiply. This rediscovery of the native culture by Zaza intellectuals not only caused a renaissance of Zaza language and culture but it also triggered feelings among younger generations of Zazas (who, however, rarely speak Zaza as a mother tongue) in favor of this modern Western use of Zaza, rekindling their interest in their ancestral language.\n\nThe diaspora has also generated a limited amount of Zaza language broadcasting. Moreover, after restrictions were removed on local languages in Turkey during their move toward an eventual accession to the European Union, Turkish state-owned TRT Kurdî television launched several Zaza programs and a radio program on certain days.\n\nAs with a number of other Indo-Iranian languages like Kurmanji and Sorani, Zaza features split ergativity in its morphology, demonstrating ergative marking in past and perfective contexts, and nominative-accusative alignment otherwise. Syntactically it is nominative-accusative.\nAmong all Western Iranian languages only Zaza and Kurmanji distinguish between masculine and feminine grammatical gender. Each noun belongs to one of those two genders. In order to correctly decline any noun and any modifier or other type of word affecting that noun, one must identify whether the noun is feminine or masculine. Most nouns have inherent gender. However, some nominal roots have variable gender, i.e. they may function as either masculine or feminine nouns. This distinguishes Zaza from many other Western Iranian languages that have lost this feature over time.\n\nFor example, the masculine preterite participle of the verb \"kerdene\" (\"to make\" or \"to do\") is \"kerde\"; the feminine preterite-participle is \"kerdiye\". Both have the sense of the English \"made\" or \"done\". The grammatical gender of the preterite-participle would be determined by the grammatical gender of the noun representing the thing that was made or done.\n\nThe linguistic notion of grammatical gender is distinguished from the biological and social notion of gender, although they interact closely in many languages. Both grammatical and natural gender can have linguistic effects in a given language.\n\nWords in Zaza can be divided into five groups in respect to their origins. Most words in Zaza are Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Iranian in origin. The fourth group consists of words that developed when Zaza speakers divided from the Proto-Iranian language. The fifth group consists of loan words. Loan words in Zaza are chiefly from Arabic and Persian.\n\nThe Zazaki alphabet contains 31 letters:\n\n\n"}
