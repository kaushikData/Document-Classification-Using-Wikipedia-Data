The exact number of coins minted is not known, as part of the archives was destroyed in the war, but some data indicate that about 3,406,066 pieces were struck. Between 1935 and 1936, 1,586,000 1 kroon coins were minted. Designed by graphic artist Günther Reindorff, it depicts the image of a 13th-century Viking cargo ship.\n\nWith the Estonian monetary reform in January 1928 the law was changed as the Riigikogu had an amendment made to the law which stated that coins of 1 and 2 krooni could be minted in other metals, not only in silver as had been the case. As the silver coins of previous coinage had been too expensive, it was decided that this requirement would have to be eliminated. The corresponding change in the law came into effect on 24 March 1934.\n\nAs published by the Riigi Teataja, the Economics Department of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Estonia announced that the Money Amendment Act (RT 30 of 1933) §§ 4 and 5, allowed the Economics Department of the Ministry of Finance to put in circulation the one-kroon coin as of 1 August 1934. The shape, dimensions, hardness, and metal composition amended within the meaning of the Act remained as such according to the law, but had yet to be approved by the government.\n\nOn 25 November 1940, the Occupation of the Baltic states by the Soviet authorities put into circulation the ruble, and on 25 March 1941, three months before the outbreak of the war with the Third Reich, the Estonian crown was withdrawn from circulation. During the German (1941-1944) and Soviet (1944-1991) occupation of Estonia, foreign currency introduced by the occupiers remained in circulation.\n\nAs in the case of the Estonian Mark, the Bank of Estonia announced a competition for the design of new banknotes and coins to be held on 4 June 1926. The competition was attended by many well-known artists of the period such as Eduard Wiiralt, Peet Aren, Roman Nyman, and Nikolai Triik. The winner was graphic artist Günther Reindorff, who had already designed the coins for the Estonian mark.\n\nCoined in aluminum-bronze, the coin shows a golden color and weighs 6 grams (permissible error of ± 1%), has a diameter of 2.525 inches (± 0.5%), with value equivalent to 0.4032 grams of gold, being its edge smooth. The obverse of the coin bears in the center a large state seal, the coat of arms of Estonia, topped with an arc-shaped text which reads \"Eesti Vabariik\", and the year of issue \"1934\" at the bottom edge. The reverse depicts the Viking ship knarr (knorr) at sea, under which the inscription 1 kroon appears.\n\nCoins with the same design were minted in 1990, but they are not legal tender, having been produced as souvenirs. One version is even less original, having a diameter of only 16 mm and on the front the inscription \"Eesti\" instead of \"Eesti Vabariik\". These coins are both made of gold as well as silver. Another re-issued version of the coin is about its original size, but the quality of the parts is much worse.\n\nIn 2012, the 1934 one-kroon coin was voted \"the prettiest coin ever to be in circulation in Estonia\".\n\n\n"}

It can also be used to describe the quality of execution of that process. When used as a means of expression, it is synonymous with illustrating. However, it may be used for mere visualization of existing data regardless of any preconceived message or idea to express. Rendering is also a technique that can be used while designing packaging and branding. \n\nThe alternative method to rendering an image is capturing an image such as photography or image scanning. Both rendered and captured images can be mixed, edited, or both.\n\nArtistic rendering is the application of visual art styles to rendering. For photorealistic rendering styles, the emphasis is on accurate reproduction of light-and-shadow and the surface properties of the depicted objects, composition, or other more generic qualities. When the emphasis is on unique interpretive rendering styles, visual information is interpreted by the artist and displayed accordingly using the chosen art medium and level of abstraction in abstract art. In computer graphics, interpretive rendering styles are known as non-photorealistic rendering styles, but may be used to simplify technical illustrations. Rendering styles that combine photorealism with non-photorealism are known as hyperrealistic rendering styles.\n\n"}
{"id": "48477270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48477270", "title": "Black MIDI", "text": "Black MIDI\n\nBlack MIDI is a music genre consisting of compositions that use MIDI files to create a song remix containing a large number of notes, typically in the thousands or millions, and sometimes billions. People who make black MIDIs are known as blackers. However, there are no specific criteria of what is considered \"black\"; as a result, finding an exact origin of black MIDI is impossible.\n\nThough the two are unrelated in origin, the concept of impossible piano existed long before black MIDI, manifesting itself within Conlon Nancarrow's work involving player pianos where he punched holes in piano cards, creating extremely complex musical compositions in the same impossible, unplayable spirit of black MIDI. \n\nBlack MIDI was first employed in Shirasagi Yukki at Kuro Yuki Gohan's rendition of \"U.N. Owen Was Her?\", an extra boss theme from the \"Touhou Project\" shooter video game series. It was uploaded to the site Nico Nico Douga in 2009, and public awareness of Black MIDI started to spread from Japan to China and Korea in the following two years. In its beginning years, Black MIDIs were represented visually with traditional, two-stave piano sheet music, contained a number of notes only in the thousands. They were created with MIDI sequencers such as Music Studio Producer, and Singer Song Writer, and played through MIDI players such as MAMPlayer and Timidity++. The Black MIDI community in Japan vanished quickly because, according to Jason Nguyen (owner of the channel Gingeas), the group was “analogous to those TV shows where there’s a mysterious founder of a civilization that is not really known throughout the course of the show.”\n\nThe popularity of Black MIDI transitioned into Europe and the United States due to a video of a composition uploaded by Kakakakaito1998 in February 2011, and shortly thereafter, blackers from around the world began pushing limits of the style by making compositions with notes increasing into the millions and using an enormous number of colors and patterns to match the complexity of the notes. They also formed the sites Guide to Black MIDI and Official Black MIDI Wikia that introduced and set the norm of Black MIDI. \n\nThe first of these tracks to reach the million-note mark was that of “Necrofantasia” from Touhou Project by TheTrustedComputer. The end of the title of many Black MIDI videos displays how many notes are in the piece. The number of notes and file sizes that could be played back have grown with the rising amount of processing and 64-bit programs computers are able to handle, and while Black MIDIs of Japanese video game music and anime are still common, the genre has also begun spilling into modern-day pop songs, such as \"Wrecking Ball\" by Miley Cyrus. Despite this increased computer storage, there are still Black MIDI files that could cause an operating system to slow down. The two largest black MIDIs are \"Armageddon v3\" and \"TheTrueEnd,\" both of which contain the maximum number of notes allowed in the MIDI standard (about 93 trillion). Due to the nature of their creation and their sheer size, they are unable to be played back and recorded.\n\nEnglish-language blackers have formed collaboration groups, such as the Black MIDI Team, where they make MIDI files and visuals together so they can be uploaded online sooner. Blackers around the world have used software such as Synthesia, FL Studio, SynthFont, Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard, Piano From Above, MIDITrail, vanBasco Karaoke Player, MIDIPlayer (Java program), MAMPlayer, Music Studio Producer, Singer Song Writer, Tom's MIDI Player, TMIDI, and Timidity++ to create Black MIDIs. Some of them, like Jason, record the MIDI files at a slow tempo and then speed the footage in video-editing to avoid RAM and processing issues.\n\nThe term \"black MIDI\" is derived from how there are so many notes in each piece that the score would look nearly black on traditional sheet music. According to California-based blacker TheTrustedComputer, black MIDI was intended as more of a remix style than an actual genre, and derived from the idea of \"bullet hell\" shoot 'em up games, which involved \"so many bullets at a time your eyes can't keep up.\" Black MIDI has also been considered the digital equivalent, as well as a response, to composer Conlon Nancarrow's use of the player piano which also involved experimenting with several thick notes to compose intricate pieces without hands. The Guide to Black MIDI, however, denies this influence: “We believe that references to Conlon Nancarrow and piano rolls are too deep and Black MIDI origins must be found in digital MIDI music world [\"sic\"].\" \n\nBlack MIDI first received coverage by Michael Connor, a writer for the non-profit arts organization Rhizome, in September 2013, leading to attention from publications and bloggers including Aux, Gawker's Adrian Chen, Jason Kottke, and \"The Verge\". It has garnered acclaim from journalists, bloggers and electronic musicians, with many noting it as a distinctive and engaging genre thanks to how regular piano notes are combined to make new, abstract sounds not heard in many styles of music, as well as the visuals representing the notes. Hackaday's Elliot Williams spotlighted the style as ironic, given that the fast-paced arpeggios and \"splatter-chords\" that are developed with a restricted number of voices come together to make other tones that leads a piano sounding more like a chiptune and less like an actual piano.\n\n"}

Blue Morpho, established in 2002, is located on the Iquitos–Nauta Road at kilometer 53, one hour away by road from the city of Iquitos, Peru.\n\nBlue Morpho was founded by its owner, Hamilton Souther, as a center for shamanism 300 kilometers from the city of Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon rain forest. Blue Morpho currently has two master shamans (maestros) working in the camp, Hamilton Souther, and Don Alberto Torres Davila, as well as several apprentice shamans and a staff of over ten native Peruvians. Blue Morpho maintains its connection and roots to traditional shamanic practices through the presence of Don Alberto Torres Davila. He heads the mesa of shamans (group of shamans from the same lineage) which includes Hamilton Souther. Hamilton Souther was trained under master shamans Don Julio Llerena Pinedo and Don Alberto Torres Davila, starting in 2001 through 2006, at which time he was granted the status of maestro by his mentors. Don Julio is deceased and has passed his legacy to Don Alberto. Hamilton and Don Alberto have practiced together for over 10 years.\n\nThe center consists of 13 buildings of traditional native architecture, all constructed by locals using raw materials from the jungle.\n\nHamilton Souther completed a degree in anthropology from the University of Colorado in 2000. In 2001, he left his California home and traveled to Peru. Later that year, he studied ayahuasca shamanism under various Peruvian shamans on the Aucayacu River in the Amazon rain forest, approximately 24 hours away from Iquitos, Peru, by boat.\n\nThen, in 2002, Souther began apprenticing with Don Alberto Torres Davila and Don Julio Llerena Pinedo, two medicine men in the area. Souther constructed a camp nearby, where he would live during his studies. It soon became clear to him that many Westerners would benefit from similar spiritual work, so he established Blue Morpho, named after the bright blue Amazonian butterfly of the same name. With its inception, Souther began guiding guests on the 24-hour trip by boat from Iquitos deep into the jungle. As more guests arrived, he added greater infrastructure to accommodate their needs.\n\nOn November 16th 2018, the head shaman and General Manager of Blue Morpho, Malcolm Rossiter, apparently committed suicide by jumping from the balcony of his apartment in Lima, Peru. He had left a suicide note on his Facebook page indicating that he intended to kill himself.\n\n"}

The method has also been used by forgers.\n\nTraditional Far Eastern cast coins—so-called 'cash coins'—are the most famous example of cast coinage, and were issued from the 4th century BC until circa 1912, predominantly in bronze, brass or iron. Traditional Far Eastern coins were generally cast base metal coins, although silver and gold bars were also manufactured, e.g. Chinese sycee, Japanese obans and kobans, and Vietnamese lang and tien.\n\nCast potins circulated in Kent from around 100 BC to around 50 BC. At a point during the first century of the Christian era, cast bronze coins were produced in Dorset with archaeological evidence pointing towards Hengistbury Head as the source. \n\nBy AD 200, cast copies of silver denarii were being produced in a number of areas of Britain.

{"id": "1915136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915136", "title": "Code-talker paradox", "text": "Code-talker paradox\n\nA code-talker paradox is a situation in which a language prevents communication. As an issue in linguistics, the paradox raises questions about the fundamental nature of languages. As such, the paradox is a problem in philosophy of language. \n\nThe term code-talker paradox was coined in 2001 by Mark Baker to describe the Navajo code talking used during World War II. Code talkers are able to create a language mutually intelligible to each other but completely unintelligible to everyone who does not know the code. This causes a conflict of interests without actually causing any conflict at all. In the case of Navajo code-talkers, cryptanalysts were unable to decode messages in Navajo, even when using the most sophisticated methods available. At the same time, the code talkers were able to encrypt and decrypt messages quickly and easily by translating them into and from Navajo. Thus the code talker paradox refers to how human languages can be so similar and different at once: so similar that one can learn them both and gain the ability to translate from one to the other, yet so different that if someone knows one language but does not know another, it is not always possible to derive the meaning of a text by analyzing it or infer it from the other language.\n\nBaker solves the paradox with the theory of universal grammar. Within universal grammar, there are certain parameters that are shared by all languages. Languages differ from one another in that a given parameter may have different settings across languages. The number of possible combinations of parameter settings accounts for the diversity of human languages, and the fact that every human brain is wired to process the same parameters means that to learn a new language, the brain simply adapts what it already knows. The brain recognizes the parameters of the first language to which it was exposed and when it processes a different language, it simply changes the values of corresponding parameters. Hence human languages vary greatly from one to the other, yet each human has the theoretical capacity to learn, converse in, and translate to and from, any human language.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7648004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7648004", "title": "Common Room (university)", "text": "Common Room (university)\n\nIn some universities in the United Kingdom and Ireland — particularly collegiate universities such as Oxford and Cambridge, as well as Dublin University, Durham University, University of York, University of Kent and Lancaster University— students and the academic body are organised into a common room, or at Cambridge a combination room. These groups exist to provide representation in the organisation of college or residential hall life, to operate certain services within these institutions such as laundry or recreation, and to provide opportunities for socialising. Typically, though there are variations based on institutional tradition and needs, the following common rooms will exist in a college or hall: Outside the UK, the terms JCR, MCR, and SCR are used by Harvard University, Yale University, Princeton University, and the University of Toronto.\n\n\nIn addition to this, each of the above phrases may also refer to an actual room designated for the use of these groups. At the University of Cambridge, the term \"combination room\" (e.g., \"Junior Combination Room\") is also used, with the same abbreviations. As a generalisation, JCRs are associations of undergraduates and SCRs an association of tutors and academics associated with a college. Postgraduates are sometimes given their own MCR, or placed in with either of the other groups. This terminology has, in addition, been taken up in some universities in other English speaking nations.\n\nThe terms JCR, MCR and SCR originated from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. The terms are now used at ten British universities as well as Trinity College, Dublin in Ireland, Harvard College in the United States of America and at the University of Trinity College in the University of Toronto, Canada. Due to the way that the terms have evolved over time and the idiosyncratic nature of university structure, the use of the three terms varies considerably from institution to institution. The main variations involve terminology, mature students and postgraduate students.\n\nIn addition to this, the terms may be used to refer to the elected groups that run the common rooms. Other names such as \"Exec\" may exist for these.\n\nAt the University of Oxford, a typical college has a Junior Common Room (JCR) for undergraduates, a Middle Common Room (MCR) for graduates and a Senior Common Room (SCR) for its fellows. JCRs and MCRs have a committee, with a president and so on, that represent their students to college authorities, Oxford University Student Union (OUSU), etc., in addition to being an actual room for the use of members. SCRs typically have a President, an academic member of the body who deals with higher-level administrative matters pertaining to the SCR, such as inviting proposed visiting fellows to the body and identifying invited lecturers to any particular college event. SCRs are typically characterised by a copious provision of coffee, newspapers, and moderately informal space for academics to think and discuss ideas.\n\nWadham College is a notable exception: although it maintains an MCR, its entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union (SU).\n\nThe JCR and MCR presidents of all affiliated Oxford Common Rooms, in addition to their OUSU Reps, are automatically voting members of OUSU's governing Council, which meets fortnightly during term to decide on virtually all aspects of OUSU's policy. OUSU Council meetings take place in odd-numbered weeks of the University term. JCR Presidents also get together in even-numbered weeks for meetings of Presidents' Committee (popularly known as Prescom). MCR Presidents also get together up to three times a term for meetings of the MCR Presidents' Committee (popularly known as MCR-PresCom).\n\nAlternative names are sometimes used for college MCRs. Brasenose College has the \"Hulme Common Room\" (HCR), and University College has the \"Weir Common Room\", named in honour of college alumni. At Christ Church, St Antony's and Templeton the representative bodies for postgraduate students are called \"Graduate Common Rooms\" or \"GCRs\". At some graduate colleges such as Wolfson, St. Cross and Linacre College, students and fellows share a single, egalitarian Common Room.\n\nIn addition, colleges sometimes have additional common rooms, such as the \"Summer Common Room\" at Magdalen College. These are sometimes, but not always, associated with a particular section of the student or academic body.\nAt the University of Cambridge, most colleges have either common rooms or combination rooms, a tradition dating from the seventeenth century. The same abbreviations, JCR, MCR, and SCR are used for combination rooms. The JCR represents undergraduates, with postgraduate students being members of the Middle Combination Room. In some colleges, postgraduates are members of both the MCR and JCR: for example, at St John's, where the MCR is known as the Samuel Butler Room or at Peterhouse. Most colleges also have an SCR. At Pembroke College the common rooms are called \"parlours\", such as the Junior Parlour and Graduate Parlour. At Jesus College, Cambridge, the JCR is known as \"The Jesus College Students' Union\", with its physical space being the Marshall Room.\n\nSimilarly, Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge has both a JCR, MCR, SCR along with a Sidney Sussex College Students Union of which all students are members.\n\nJCRs and MCRs have elected committees to represent their interests within their colleges and in the central students' union. Cambridge University Students' Union. The committees are almost universally led by a President and a range of other elected positions to cover specific areas or interest or functions (e.g. Secretary, Treasurer, Entertainment). There is a great deal of variety between the colleges in terms of the roles that the JCRs and MCRs undertake, how much influence they have in college affairs and how many functions they provide. Nearly all are responsible for organising Freshers Week and frequent entertainments.\n\nJCR Presidents and External Officers in Cambridge are \"ex officio\" council members of the Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU). Before CUSU was established, individual JCRs were direct members of the NUS. This meant that Churchill JCR was able to lead the NUS in its campaign for student representation. Unlike most universities, CUSU serves the common rooms and common rooms may choose to disaffiliate. CUSU is funded by the common rooms rather than funding them.\n\nHalls of the University of Bristol cater mostly for first year undergraduate students, though there is a sizable undergraduate and postgraduate community who choose to stay on, either in the capacity as Tutors or as full paying boarders. The term JCR refers to the entire undergraduate population, but more specifically and commonly to the elected body of students who run the JCR for one academic year. Though most Bristol Hall JCRs are made up of first years, it is custom in Clifton Hill House, Goldney Hall, Wills Hall and Manor Hall to elect returning students to the majority of positions, including JCR President.\n\nThere is no MCR, but the SCR includes the Warden, the Vice/Deputy Warden, the Tutors and honourable guests at Formal Hall. Hall Bars physically house the JCR, with a separate and publicly inaccessible SCR room reserved elsewhere in Hall.\n\nAt Durham, the majority of the sixteen colleges divide their members into:\n\nIn addition, there may be one or more rooms set aside for the use of these bodies referred to as 'the JCR' or 'the MCR' etc. The committees that run the JCR and MCR are called the Executive Committee or \"Exec\". Membership of the JCR and MCR is not obligatory to students.\n\nThere are some exceptions to this. The College of St Hild and St Bede has a \"Students Representative Council\", which includes both undergraduates and postgraduates at the college, with a special postgraduate committee. St.Aidan's College combines the MCR and SCR into one SCR whereby the postgraduates and senior members belong to one Common Room as a whole, while St Cuthbert's Society combines the JCR and MCR into one JCR. Following a referendum in 2011, students of St. John's College are represented by the \"John's Common Room\" (JCR) a composite body representing Undergraduates, the MCR (Postgraduates) and the Cranmer Common Room (representing the students of Cranmer Hall) (pre-2011 the body was the Joint Junior Common Rom JJCR). Ustinov College, which does not take undergraduates, has a Graduate Common Room (GCR) for its students.\n\nAlthough the Durham Students' Union is independent from the college common rooms, each college has a representative to the union.\n\nAt the University of Exeter, a number of residential halls for first year undergraduates retain traditional common room structures. Lopes, Hope and Mardon hall are all home to extensive Common Room set ups, which form a central part of student life there. In such Halls, committees are elected to represent the student body via the Common Room, and it is their job to liaise with the Resident Tutors who reside within the Hall. Although somewhat under threat by mergers of Halls and changes to internal administration, the Common Rooms still play an active and important role within the University, by both providing welfare and recourse to higher authorities for the students, and by organising social events such as balls, formals and more casual activities.\n\nAt Kent each of the colleges was initially built with one or more \"senior Common Room\" social spaces. However, over the passage of time a number of the common rooms have been transformed into eateries and more formalised social areas. Each college has a \"management Committee\" (formerly \"Junior College Committee\" and before that, \"Junior Common Room Committee\") which acts to represent the students of each college at the students' union and organise cultural events.\n\nThe Rooms and Committees have traditionally been open to both undergraduates and postgraduates, with the Senior Common Rooms provided for staff.\n\nAt Lancaster, undergraduates are members of one of eight colleges (with a further college for postgraduate students). Each undergraduate college is a quasi-autonomous body within the university, and each divides its members into Junior and Senior Common Rooms. These terms are more indicative of the collective student/staff bodies than actual space, although each college has actual common rooms set aside for Junior members. Senior members are less fortunate due to a current policy by the university's estates department of removing Senior Common Room space from college control – refurbishing these as teaching rooms or putting them on the central booking system, so SCR members cannot just \"drop in\". The term \"JCR\", although intended to refer to all junior members of a college, is often used to refer to elected members of each college's JCR Executive. Each JCR Executive organises a range of social and sporting activities for its college while also offering welfare support for its junior members. The President and Vice President represent their college at the Student Union Council and on a range of University Committees, and many JCR Executive members sit with SCR members on the College Syndicate – the governing body of each college.\n\nWithin the Graduate College, the Graduate Students Association (GSA) takes on the role of an \"MCR\". Lancaster has a Students' Union which co-ordinates activities between the different colleges, and the JCR and GSA executives are considered to be standing committees of the Union Council.\n\nAt Leicester the Junior Common Room (JCR) is open to all members of the University, although its main focus is around the Halls of Residence of the University. The committee was responsible for running the various activities within the Halls of Residence and the represents students based at the Halls. The Term JCR also refers informally to the undergraduate population of the University as a whole . The committee of the JCR is main elected from its members within the Halls of Residence. The Senior Common Room (SCR) for the University remains on its main Campus. Membership of the Common Room is open to all full-time members of staff but not postgraduate students, although they may be entertained as guests of members in the bar. The Common Room itself and its activates are governed by a committee of elected academics and fellows.\n\nAt Nottingham, the majority of the Halls of Residence predominantly house undergraduates, with a small number of postgraduates living in hall as part of the pastoral and disciplinary system; in this instance, the JCR refers to the undergraduate members of the hall. Postgraduates, along with a Warden, comprise the SCR (Senior Common Room). The Hall Warden is a member of university staff, often an academic, that might reside either in a special residence within the hall, or in a nearby house.\n\nJCR activities include representation by elected students of their hallmates on accommodation issues, organised social events, and sports teams that compete in the Athletic Union's Inter-mural sports competitions. Since most students move out of halls after their first year, it is common for students to retain a sense of affiliation to their hall while living 'off-campus'. Many JCRs include former residents of the hall in their sports teams.\n\nAll of the JCRs are now part of the Students' Union.\n\nMelton Hall houses only postgraduates, and the student organisation there forms the university's only MCR.\nUniversity of Reading JCRs are set up in a very similar way to their Oxford counterparts, as the University was founded as University College, Reading, as part of Christ Church, Oxford. The JCRs at Reading are some of the oldest outside Oxbridge with some such as Wantage JCR founded in 1908, St Patrick's Hall JCR in 1913 and Wessex JCR later in 1915. Today there are thirteen JCRs operating independently of each other, although they do work with the Students' Union. JCRs represent all Students in a particular Hall as well as having a large number of attached members living in houses.\n\nEach year a new committee is elected in each halls.\n\nUniversity of Reading Senior Common Room began life in 1897 as the Common Room, but in 1908 a proposal was found to be necessary (and was carried) to have the title altered from Staff Common Room to Senior Common Room. The Senior Common Room (SCR) functions as a 'staff social club' of the University. The membership currently includes over 800 academic, administrative and technical staff within the various departments and offices from across the University. Postgraduates may become associated members.\n\nAt the University of St Andrews, each hall of residence has a common room for use by all the resident students. Each year, the residents of the hall elect a committee that is responsible for social events. A portion of the yearly residence fees are earmarked for use by the committee for such events. Each hall also has a warden, assisted by one or more subwardens, who is responsible for discipline in the hall (such as dealing with complaints of excessive noise), and who also acts as an advisor to the committee.\n\nThe hall common rooms may contain a television or hall library (some halls have dedicated rooms for these). The committee may also subscribe to newspapers and magazines, or buy books and DVDs, which are made available in the common room.\n\nIn addition St Mary's College has a JCR for the use of undergraduates and an SCR for the use of staff.\n\nThe previous principal of St Andrews, Brian Lang, was criticized and finally rebuked by the university court for requisitioning common rooms in certain halls for private parties, despite complaints by residents about noise and disruption to hall activities. His successor, Louise Richardson, has indicated that she will not continue this or any similar practice.\n\nJCRs at the University of Southampton exist in each of the different halls of residences; Archers Road, Mayflower, Bencraft, Chamberlain, Connaught Hall, Erasmus Park (At Winchester School Of Art), Glen Eyre, Highfield halls and Montefiore. The JCRs provide a welfare and support role to new students, and coordinate social and sports activities around the halls. Yearly elections are held in December, with members serving one or two yearly terms. In 2009 JCRs became part of Southampton University Students' Union representative structure and operate under the JCR Executive officer, with a budget of nearly £92,000.\n\nThe day-to-day running of the colleges is managed by an elected committee of staff and student members chaired by the college's Provost. Colleges have a Junior Common Room (JCR) for undergraduate students, which is managed by the elected Junior Common Room Committee (JCRC), and a Graduate Common Room (GCR) for post-graduate students, as well as a Senior Common Room (SCR), which is managed by elected representatives of the college's academic and administrative members. The only exceptions to this are Wentworth which as a post-graduate only college does not have a Junior Common Room, and Halifax and Constantine which are run by a student association that represents both undergraduates and postgraduates together. Langwith's Junior Common Room is branded as a Student Association, however Langwith retains a Graduate Common Room and a Senior Common Room and therefore it's SA plays the same role as the JCRC in the other colleges.\n\nThe Junior Common Rooms are run by a Junior Common Room Committee (JCRC) headed by an 'Executive Committee' made up of a Chair/President, Vice Chair/Presidents, Secretary, and Treasurer who have signatory powers. Below the Executive Committee are the rest of the members of the committees who have responsibilities for welfare, activities, events and the general running of the committee. Annual elections are held in November with people coming forward to stand for the various positions. Each individual college's JCRC is slightly different in composition, however all are elected by the undergraduate population following a hustings. The successful candidates are then elected for a whole year, bar any extenuating circumstances e.g. a Vote of No Confidence. The JCRC's primary functions are to be representative of the specific needs of their undergraduate populations, and to provide welfare help to students in the form of welfare reps who can offer advice or give contact details of other groups to students through informal \"drop-in\" sessions. With York's collegiate system though, JCRCs are increasingly involved in fostering college spirit through organising the many major social events a college has, such as Christmas and Summer formal Balls.\n\nAt Harvard College, the term \"Junior Common Room\" officially refers to the collection of undergraduates affiliated with one of Harvard's 12 houses. Every undergraduate is assigned to a house in the spring of his or her freshman year and thereafter is a member of that house's Junior Common Room, including students who have chosen to reside off campus.\n\nIn everyday usage, however, \"Junior Common Room\" almost always refers to a large common room in an undergraduate house by the same name, or simply \"JCR\" for short. JCRs are generally available for undergraduates to study or watch television, and student groups often reserve the space for meetings. This is in contrast to a \"Senior Common Room,\" or SCR, which is for exclusive use of the houses' Senior Common Room members, which includes the House Masters, tutors, and other accomplished academics in the community.\n\nThe Faculty of Religious Studies houses a JCR and SCR. The JCR is a center for social activity among students, and the SCR is often used as a setting in films due to its luxurious setting. The university residences also have areas which are designated as \"common rooms\".\n\nPaton College of Memorial University of Newfoundland has a Junior Common Room for undergraduates and all members of the university, and a Senior Common Room for use by academics.\n\nLady Eaton College continues several Oxbridge traditions present at the founding of Trent University in 1964. This includes a Junior Common Room for the use of students and a Senior Common Room for college fellows and staff. It is the only college on the main campus that presently maintains both a JCR and SCR.\n\nMost colleges at University of Toronto have a common room system. The University of Trinity College, has maintained many of the traditions of Oxbridge, including the wearing of academic gowns and several common rooms, including a Junior Common Room, Divinity Common Room, and Senior Common Room, which are all communities within the college as well as physical rooms. All undergraduate students registered in the college are members of the Junior Common Room, which hosts a variety of lively social activities, as well as serving as a comfortable student lounge with newspapers from around the world. The Divinity Common Room is available to students in Trinity's Faculty of Divinity, the oldest Anglican theological faculty in Canada. The Senior Common Room consists of college fellows with teaching appointments in the University of Toronto, teaching staff in the Faculty of Divinity, senior college administrators, postgraduate students who serve as academic dons, and divinity graduate students with fellowships. Other select members of the wider academic, social, and ecclesiastical community are also included. The SCR hosts a number of social and educational events and weekly high table dinners in Strachan Hall. The room, which overlooks the college quadrangle, is a faculty lounge hosting daily tea and weekly wine receptions. In University College, Toronto, the JCR is a popular hangout for students.\n\nNewman College has two common rooms:\n\n\nThe student population at Ormond College is split into four common rooms:\n\n\nTrinity has three common rooms:\n\n\nThe Women's College, University of Sydney has three common rooms:\n\n\nThe student population at St. Andrew's College, Sydney is split into two common rooms:\n\n\nThe student population at St. Paul's College, Sydney is split into two common rooms:\n\n\nJane Franklin Hall has three common rooms:\n\n\nChrist College has two common rooms:\n\n\nTrinity has two common rooms:\n\n"}

An argument is valid if and only if its corresponding conditional is a logical truth. It follows that an argument is valid if and only if the negation of its corresponding conditional is a contradiction. Therefore, the construction of a corresponding conditional provides a useful technique for determining the validity of an argument.\n\nConsider the argument A:\nEither it is hot or it is cold\nIt is not hot\nTherefore it is cold\nThis argument is of the form:\nEither P or Q \nNot P \nTherefore Q\nor (using standard symbols of propositional calculus):\nP Q \nP\n____________\nQ\nThe corresponding conditional C is:\nIF ((P or Q) and not P) THEN Q \nor (using standard symbols):\n((P Q) P) Q\nand the argument A is valid just in case the corresponding conditional C is a necessary truth.\n\nIf C is a necessary truth then C entails Falsity (The False).\n\nThus, any argument is valid if and only if the denial of its corresponding conditional leads to a contradiction.\n\nIf we construct a truth table for C we will find that it comes out T (true) on every row (and of course if we construct a truth table for the negation of C it will come out F (false) in every row. These results confirm the validity of the argument A\n\nSome arguments need first-order predicate logic to reveal their forms and they cannot be tested properly by truth tables forms.\n\nConsider the argument A1:\nSome mortals are not Greeks\nSome Greeks are not men\nNot every man is a logician\nTherefore Some mortals are not logicians\nTo test this argument for validity, construct the corresponding conditional C1 (you will need first-order predicate logic), negate it, and see if you can derive a contradiction from it. If you succeed, then the argument is valid.\n\nInstead of attempting to derive the conclusion from the premises proceed as follows.\n\nTo test the validity of an argument (a) translate, as necessary, each premise and the conclusion into sentential or predicate logic sentences (b) construct from these the negation of the corresponding conditional (c) see if from it a contradiction can be derived (or if feasible construct a truth table for it and see if it comes out false on every row.) Alternatively construct a truth tree and see if every branch is closed. Success proves the validity of the original argument.\n\nIn case of the difficulty in trying to derive a contradiction, one should proceed as follows. From the negation of the corresponding conditional derive a theorem in conjunctive normal form in the methodical fashions described in text books. If, and only if, the original argument was valid will the theorem in conjunctive normal form be a contradiction, and if it is, then that it is will be apparent. \n\n"}
{"id": "2792334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2792334", "title": "Cour d'honneur", "text": "Cour d'honneur\n\nCour d'honneur (, court of honor) is the architectural term for a three-sided ceremonial courtyard, created by flanking the main central block, or \"corps de logis\", with symmetrical advancing secondary wings containing minor rooms. The Palace of Versailles (\"illustration\") and Blenheim Palace (\"plan\") both feature such entrance courts.\n\nSome 16th-century symmetrical Western European country houses built on U-shaped groundplans resulted in a sheltered central door in a main range that was embraced between projecting wings, but the formalized cour d'honneur is first found in the great palaces and mansions of 17th-century Europe, where it forms the principal approach and ceremonial entrance to the building. Its open courtyard is presented like the classical permanent theatre set of a proscenium stage, such as the built Roman set of opposed \"palazzi\" in a perspective street at Palladio's Teatro Olimpico (Vicenza, 1584). Like the theatre set the built environment is defined and enclosed from the more public space by ornate wrought iron gilded railings. A later development replaced the railings with an open architectural columnar screen, as at Palais Royal (Paris), Schönbrunn Palace (Vienna), Alexander Palace (Saint Petersburg), or Henry Holland's Ionic screen formerly at Carlton House, London (\"illustrated below\").\nTechnically, the term cour d'honneur can be used of any large building whether public or residential, ancient or modern, which has a symmetrical courtyard set apart in this way, at which the honored visitor arrives. (The rest may arrive without flourish, through a side entrance.)\n\nExamples of a cour d'honneur can be found in many of the most notable Baroque and classicizing buildings of Europe including the Palazzo Pitti, one of the first 16th century residences to open a cour d'honneur—in the Pitti's case by embracing three sides of an existing public space. Other 16th century urban \"palazzi\" remained resolutely enclosed, like Palazzo Farnese, Rome. In Rome, the wings of Carlo Maderno's Palazzo Barberini design (1627), were the first that reached forward from a central block to create a cour d'honneur floorplan.\nOn a condensed, urban scale the formula is expressed in Parisian private houses, \"hôtels particuliers\" built \"entre cour et jardin\" (), between court and garden. In these plans, the street front may be expressed as a range of buildings not unlike the ordinary houses (\"maisons\") that flank it, but with a grand, often arched, doorway, through which a carriage could pass into the cour d'honneur secreted behind. In a cramped site, one of the flanking walls of the cour d'honneur may be no more than an architectural screen, balancing the wing of the hôtel opposite it, which would often contain domestic offices and a stable. On a grander scale, the Palais Royal was laid out in just this manner, among the first Paris \"hôtels particuliers\" to have a cour d'honneur, which once was separated from the public street by a wrought iron grille, later by an open architectural screen, with its grand open \"jardin\" behind, now a public space. Nearby, the Tuileries Palace is gone: but the cour d'honneur with its Arc du Carrousel remains, as do the Tuileries Gardens behind the former palace's site.\nIn densely built cities disposed on a rigorously democratic grid plan such as New York, private houses with a cour d'honneur were rare, even in the Gilded Age; the Villard Houses on Madison Avenue and the former William K. Vanderbilt House on the Plaza were the rare exceptions. In London, Burlington House retains its cour d'honneur, whereas the Buckingham Palace's is no longer extant, as it was remodeled to be enclosed on all 4 sides, thus becoming (and now known as) a quadrangle.\n"}
{"id": "10359589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10359589", "title": "Dennō Coil", "text": "Dennō Coil\n\n, Coil—A Circle of Children, is a Japanese science fiction anime television series depicting a near future where semi-immersive augmented reality (AR) technology has just begun to enter the mainstream. The series takes place in the fictional city of Daikoku, a hotbed of AR development with an emerging citywide virtual infrastructure. It follows a group of children as they use AR glasses to unravel the mysteries of the half real, half Internet city, using a variety of illegal software tools, techniques, and virtual pets to manipulate the digital landscape.\n\n\"Dennō Coil\", in development for over a decade, is the series director debut of Japanese animator Mitsuo Iso. It premiered on NHK Educational TV on May 12, 2007. Due to the animators involved in its production and its unusually high-profile television broadcast time slot, \"Dennō Coil\" was highly anticipated. An English dub Den-noh Coil was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Maiden Japan in June 2016.\n\nIn 2026, eleven years after the introduction of internet-connected augmented reality eyeglasses and visors, Yūko Okonogi moves with her family to the city of Daikoku, the technological center of the emerging half-virtual world. Yūko joins her grandmother's \"investigation agency\" made up of children equipped with virtual tools and metatags. As their research turns up mounting evidence of children who have been whisked away to the mysterious \"other side\" of reality, they find themselves entangled in a conspiracy to cover up the dangerous true nature and history of the new technology.\n\n\"Dennō\" means \"computer\" and is analogous to the archaic English term \"cyberbrain\". In the series, the word is used to differentiate between virtual and real, e.g. \"dennō cat\". The title of the show itself, \"Dennō Coil\", refers to a dangerous separation of one's digital self from the physical body.\n\nThe children access the virtual world through Internet-connected visors, which they refer to as \"megane\", the usual term for protective or corrective eyeglasses. The visors allow them to see virtual reality superimposed on objective reality. To visually confirm something as virtual, the children often lift their visors from their eyes. The visors also work in conjunction with futuristic ear monitors placed behind the ear, which allow the wearer to hear sounds from the virtual environment.\n\nInteraction with the virtual world is handled in a similar fashion to contemporary video games. Software tools are visually represented as tactile tools (e.g. a fishing rod) which occupy 3D virtual space and must be manipulated by hand. Sophisticated tools include metatags, visually represented as \"o-fuda\" (paper talismans), and efficacious chalk circles called \"angō\", meaning \"code\", which have a variety of effects. Virtual objects such as pets cannot be recalled or reset; when a pet runs away, it must be chased and caught in 3D space. Virtual objects and pets are also susceptible to a form of \"death\" by data corruption or deletion. For a virtual object or pet to be deleted from cyberspace, it can be attacked by a virtual weapon, such as Searchmaton's beam weapons. While users of dennō eyeglasses cannot be physically harmed by virtual weapons, their costly personal data and virtual possessions can be damaged.\n\nSearchmaton, the maintenance and antivirus bot of Daikoku, is constantly on the lookout for illegal objects and damaged space, which includes corrupted or obsolete space, computer viruses, and the forbidden pets and tools that the protagonists own. The virtual side of Daikoku is shown as an emerging space, requiring some maintenance. In the first episode, the virtual dog Densuke falls into an obsolete virtual space at a physical construction site. Due to a version mismatch between the dog and the space, Densuke finds himself glitching and destabilizing in the environment. Eventually Searchmaton reformats the obsolete space. It is also shown that the virtual space represented in Daikoku is tied to the city's electronic infrastructure. In one scene, Fumie Hashimoto uses a metatag to control a traffic light.\n\nThe underground virtual currency of Daikoku is known as meta, which is equivalent to the Japanese yen, and is traded in the form of \"metabugs\". The market value of a metabug can change according to its supply and demand. It is explained that a metabug represents a special kind of software bug, and from their unique properties they can be refined into tools or metatags by skilled craftsmen. Metabugs, which are especially abundant in the city of Daikoku, can only be unearthed in damaged or corrupted spaces. Metabugs are also a target of deletion for Searchmaton.\n\nDespite being a computer environment, the virtual side of \"Dennō Coil\" has a tangible and sometimes organic design, with much of the interaction requiring physical effort in 3D space. In order to hack into a corrupted virtual space in Daikoku, Fumie Hashimoto handles a software spray can loaded with so-called \"black bug spray\". A virus on the run from Searchmaton leaves behind a (virtually) tangible, evaporating black trail of raw \"dennō substance\". The virtual dog Densuke uses his nose to follow the trail. However, dennō eyeglasses do not grant the user the ability to \"feel\" the virtual world. Therefore, using software tools and playing with virtual pets requires some degree of active make-believe from the user.\nA special type of rogue virtual organism known as \"illegals\" populate the damaged and obsolete spaces of Daikoku City. The protagonists sometimes hunt special forms of illegals in the hope of collecting valuable metabugs. Illegals, originating from \"the other side\", sometimes become lost and isolated in the city and express a desire to return to their \"homeland\". Some humanoid illegals known as Nulls can whisk people away to \"the other side\" by inducing \"dennō coil\"—a comatose state where the victim is trapped in VR.\n\nIn order to spatially synchronize virtual space and real space, users of internet-connected dennō eyeglasses constantly upload the status of physical space to the virtual infrastructure. In the fifth episode, the protagonists encounter a sparsely visited junkyard of buses on the fringes of wireless internet connectivity. Due to obsolete AR data, the buses are depicted by dennō eyeglasses as being in far better condition than they actually are. The characters sometimes exploit the discrepancies of desynchronization when dealing with metabugs and illegals.\n\nThe AR world is filled with mysteries of and ghostly tales about children losing their soul to \"the other side\", a supposed ghostly realm of VR hidden in the AR environment. The protagonists continually gain a clearer picture of the true nature of the glasses and cyberspace throughout the series. It is eventually revealed that the glasses form a two-way brain-computer interface known as Imago, first used in experimental medical treatments. However, there are substantial health risks in prolonged use of the interface, and the interface itself presents the possibility of a coma or brain death through the \"dennō coil\" phenomenon. At the same time, an experiment gone awry gave birth to Michiko, a digital life form that assumed control of Coil Domain—referred to in rumors as \"the other side\". Due to their inability to erase Coil Domain, Megamass opted to instead create a new layer of augmented reality space on top of Coil Domain, where the influence of Michiko and Imago was lessened in order to minimize the occurrence of dennō coil. Much information regarding Coil Domain, Imago, Michiko and dennō coil has been aggressively covered up by the technology conglomerate, Megamass.\n\nA recurring theme throughout the series is the depiction of torii, which are traditional Japanese gates that symbolically mark the transition from the profane to the sacred, either as actual infrastructure (virtual or real) or in chalk patterns drawn by characters in the series.\n\nEpisode three opens with the monologue, \"According to rumors in the industry, there are hidden functions in the [dennō] glasses that are better left unmentioned\". It is also rumored among children that one can \"lose their soul\" by venturing too far into obsolete space. Some children possess an extra sensitivity which allows them to perceive sounds and voices emanating from obsolete space, metabugs, and so on. Much of the AR environment is steeped in urban legends and ghostly tales, and the series highlights the special intuition, extra sensitivity and sense of closeness that the children have to the emerging AR world.\nIt is shown that the virtual side of Daikoku is heavily regulated and restricted by the Searchmaton software, therefore the children of \"Dennō Coil\" are circumventing those regulations through their mischievous adventures and their trade of \"illegal\" software tools and pets. Fumie Hashimoto describes Searchmaton as a powerful piece of software that, despite its blunt strength, is easily fooled due to its predictable behavior and unbalanced priorities. She also laments how it shows no leeway by destroying even the most harmless of virtual toys and pets. Beginning with episode six, the show often highlights the lack of nuance and the divide of understanding between the overprotective adult administrators and the child protagonists regarding the regulation of the emerging digital frontier.\n\nAccording to the series director, Mitsuo Iso, a major theme in \"Dennō Coil\" is the distance between the characters, such as Yūko's inability to feel the fur of her own virtual pet, in addition to all the relational tensions and divides of understanding between the characters in the series. In Iso's translated words, it conveys how \"there will always be a distance between people, and even between things that seem within ones' reach. And that one must walk down a long, thin and winding road before they reach one's heart. There are tons of obstacles. It's in fact like the roads in towns of old.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe newspaper \"Mainichi Shimbun\" suggested the technology shown in the series would have a great influence on the future, comparing it to the way \"Snow Crash\" influenced the development of \"Second Life\". It also praised the series for showing technology that was very Japanese, and concentrating on how the children grow. \"Dennō Coil\", along with three other animation works, was awarded an Excellence Prize along with \"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\" by a jury at the 2007 Japan Media Arts Festival. The Grand Prize was won by \"Summer Days with Coo\". At the seventh annual Tokyo International Anime Fair, \"Dennō Coil\" won top honors in the Television category along with \"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\". At the 46th Japan Science Fiction Convention, \"Dennō Coil\" was the only winner of the Seiun Award in the media category which covers all non-literary works, such as movies and TV series.\n\nMike Toole of Anime News Network named \"Dennō Coil\" among his top 10 overlooked anime of the 2000s, calling it \"sort of a spiritual successor to last decade's \"Serial Experiments Lain\"\" and \"one of those shows where the end of each episode triggers immediate desire for the next episode.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27423862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27423862", "title": "Dorota Nieznalska", "text": "Dorota Nieznalska\n\nDorota Alicja Nieznalska (born September 19, 1973) is a Polish visual artist and sculptor.\n\nNieznalska's controversial installation \"Pasja\" (2002), which included the placement of an image of the penis upon a metal Greek cross, resulted in a notable scandal, as the display was condemned as immoral and blasphemous by Polish conservative Catholics. The group exhibition at which the installation was presented was closed down by the authorities, while Nieznalska herself faced legal charges on account of an alleged violation of a provision of the Polish criminal code prohibiting blasphemy.\n\nThe sculptor was successful in fighting off the blasphemy conviction following the favorable ruling of an appeals court in 2009.\n\nDorota Alicja Nieznalska was born to a devout family in Gdańsk in 1973. Raised in the Gdańsk-Gdynia–Sopot Tricity area, Nieznalska was educated at an art high school in Gdynia Orłowo. Nieznalska enrolled at Gdańsk's Academy of Fine Arts as a student of sculpture in 1993, a year after making her first solo exhibition in her native city. Nieznalska's fine arts instructors were the Professors Franciszek Duszeńko and Grzegorz Klaman. Nieznalska graduated from the academy in 1999 and exhibited a number of student works (\"Insemination\", 1997; \"The Pleasure Principle\", 1998; \"Absolution\", 1999) in the 1990s. She subsequently participating in three major exhibitions in Gdańsk, Warsaw, and Białystok in 2000 and 2001.\n\nBlasphemy charges were levelled against Nieznalska after an exhibition featuring the 2002 work \"Pasja\" (\"Passion\"), an artistic installation concerned with the themes of masculinity and suffering. The installation was displayed at the experimental Gdańsk, Wyspa Gallery, an institution associated with the academy, and consisted of two elements: a large Greek cross made of metal was suspended from the ceiling of the gallery, and covered; its center was filled in with an image of a man's hips, thighs, and penis. Behind the cross, the viewer's attention was drawn to a large video, its display projecting from an overhead angle the face and shoulders of a grimacing man in the act of weight-lifting. The viewer's inability to behold the man's body, his other body parts being cut off from the screen, concocted an effect of ambiguity as to the activity of the man on the screen, suggesting that the man's feeling of torment could have been the effect of other kinds of activity. The installation would be described by some as depicting \"the penis of Christ\" in the ensuing controversy.\n\nGdańsk activists of the right-wing League of Polish Families began a petition to the local authorities to open a legal case following the release of television footage of the exhibition. Complaints about \"Pasja\" led to Nieznalska's being summoned to report to the local police on 2 March 2002. The city's rightist municipal councilors quickly closed the exhibition while the young artist, insisting that her intention was to focus on \"the cult of the male body\", became the defendant of a trial concerning Nieznalska's alleged violation of the criminal code. Nieznalska's upcoming exhibits in Słupsk and Ostrów Wielkopolski were cancelled after further intervention from the League of Polish Families. Members of the nationalist youth group \"Młodzież Wszechpolska\" threatened to \"hang such artists\" and \"shave their heads, like the Home Army did with women who were in close relationships with [the] Germans\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the first legal process in 2003, the court found Nieznalska guilty of \"offending religious feelings\", a violation of the ban on blasphemy within Article 196 of the criminal code. Judge Tomasz Zieliński denied that Nieznalska's work was entitled to any special constitutional protection as an object of art, stating that \"the fact that a work is within the boundaries of art has no significance for whether it can offend the feelings of other people.\" The court ordered Nieznalska to perform six months of unpaid community service. The trial prosecutor had originally demanded a fine of 2000 \"złoty\", but the court decided to increase the penalty. Judge Zieliński additionally forbade Nieznalska from traveling out of the country. The local deputies of the League of Polish Families present during the sentencing clapped to express their approval.\n\nControversy surrounding Nieznalska's installation, already boiling during the initial trial, persisted well into the appeals process. An unsigned editorial in Poland's Anglophone monthly \"The Warsaw Voice\", summing up the court case shortly after the initial verdict as a battle between the left and right - albeit \"the first of its kind\" for modern Poland - treated Nieznalska as \"a tasteless provocateur, covering up her lack of genuine talent with shock tactics\" and cited the opinion of Franciszek Starowieyski, \"one of the best-known Polish sculptors, himself rather partial to unconventional works\", who \"said before the beginning of the lawsuit that the one to blame was not the novice artist but the curator of the Gdańsk gallery. According to Starowieyski, Nieznalska's installation was of such a low artistic standard that it should never have been exhibited. Many other known artists, while not approving of the sentence, agreed that if not for the scandal, Nieznalska's work would have stood little chance of making it into reputable galleries.\" The former president Lech Wałęsa spoke out against Nieznalska and supported a hard line, maintaining that the artist's sentence was insufficiently severe. The fine arts professors supporting the Wyspa exhibitions decided to atone for the mistake by closing the gallery.\n\nThe more liberal sections of Polish society stood up in support of the sculptor's right to free artistic expression. A letter of protest signed about 1500 artists, professionals, and other concerned citizens argued for \"civic freedoms\" and art as \"one sphere\" of \"freedom, incorrectness, difference.\" An opinion piece by Andrzej Osęka for the liberal daily \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" compared the Nieznalska case to the 2005 \"Jyllands-Posten\" controversy in Denmark, noting that whereas the Danish newspaper suffered no legal consequences on account of its publication of a cartoon deliberately offensive to the Muslim faith in spite of loud outcries from Muslim communities around the world, Nieznalska's case had resulted in a campaign of legal intimidation because of poor legislation and the judges' deference to the politicians. The Adam Mickiewicz University art historian Pawel Leszkowicz compared Nieznalska to Alicja Zebrowska and Katarzyna Kozyra, two other female artists attacked for immoral works in the 1990s.\n\nTwo former Wyspa staff - curator Aneta Szylak and director Grzegorz Klaman, Nieznalska's former instructor - wrote that while \"[s]ince the times of Plato, the academy [had been] a place for intellectual and artistic discourse\", the principle \"was broken when the gallery closed... Because she had the courage to show 'Pasja', Nieznalska had her scholarships and subsidies cut off; she has been stigmatized and censored... A spectacular political sham is [the League of Polish Families'] typical marketing strategy, and the judge acted just like they wanted him to.\"\n\nNieznalska was acquitted after an arduous process and multiple appeals in June 2009. The \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" hailed the decision as \"a toast to freedom.\"\n\nThe European Humanist Federation has alleged that Polish prosecutors have been trying to revive the case in 2010. Polish reports denied that Nieznalska would be subjected to a third trial, emphasizing the acquittal as binding.\n\nOfficial websites:\nThe blasphemy case:\n"}

Most recently, a television series entitled \"\" began on January 15, 2007, and finished its third and final season in 2009.\n\nThe first movie revolves around one Bob Gratton (played by Julien Poulin, who co-wrote and co-directed the movies with Falardeau) and his passion for Elvis Presley. Gratton's life goal is to win fame as an Elvis impersonator, and he achieves it through a local TV talent show contest whose prize is a cruise to the fictional island resort of Santa Banana. After his return from Santa Banana Gratton is called on to don his Elvis costume one more time, but because he has gained weight in the interim, he has trouble fitting into it and collapses on stage during a performance, seemingly dead. In the film's final scene, just as Gratton's casket is taken for interment Bob emerges from it, quite alive.\n\nThe second movie revolves around Gratton's later adventures after being discovered by a talent scout, and his rise to fame as a pop music star.\n\nThe third installment sees Gratton become the head of a media company and play an active role in manipulating the news that his media empire puts out.\n\nIn the 1980s, Falardeau and Poulin were very clear as to the goal of the early short films which constituted the first instalment of \"Elvis Gratton\": the intent was to portray (via parody) Falardeau's and Poulin's view of the mindset that they believed had driven a majority of Québécois to vote for the No side of the 1980 referendum on Quebec sovereignty. Gratton is portrayed as fat and uneducated, but also conservative, pro-American, racist and federalist. The films' comical situations are premissed on Gratton's tacky (\"quétaine\") character and backward-thinking views, with which Falardeau and Poulin sought to associate Quebec federalists more generally. Years later, Falardeau would reveal that he regretted the movie's focus on slapstick comedy and the protagonist's constant comic relief which, in his eyes, removed the underlying message of the movie and made the movie popular only for its jokes. It should be noted in Falardeau's views on Quebec federalists that Gratton is a local entrepreneur, employs a few workers but has other goals in life, like becoming famous all around the world (even with no talent) and most importantly being loved by the world. For example, in the second movie the character accepts all offers and signs all contracts possible (without reading them) in the hope of these goals, even if that's the best way to go bankrupt. Having to be loved by others is linked with Falardeau's view of federalists.\n\nFalardeau's motivation to create a second Elvis Gratton movie started in the 1990s, when Falardeau sought financing for his \"15 février 1839\" film project showing aspects of the Lower Canada Rebellion. Since this movie was about Quebec's history, Falardeau had been collecting donations for some time until it was suggested that a new Elvis Gratton movie would most likely be a hit and garner sufficient funds. The exercise indeed proved fruitful, and \"15 février 1839\" was released later in 2001.\n\nElvis Gratton showed up (remarkably un-politicised) in 1996 in an ad campaign as the year's spokesman for Opération Nez rouge (Operation Red Nose), a local initiative in Québec to provide a free driving service to take party-goers' cars back home during the holidays (along with said party-goers). Opération Nez Rouge has a history of using different humorists and/or characters each year to promote its activities.\n\n"}

In some countries, the term \"native language\" or \"mother tongue\" refers to the language of one's ethnic group rather than one's first language. Children brought up speaking more than one language can have more than one native language, and be bilingual or multilingual. By contrast, a \"second language\" is any language that one speaks other than one's first language.\n\nOne of the more widely accepted definitions of native speakers is that they were born in a particular country raised to speak the language of that country during the critical period of their development. The person qualifies as a \"native speaker\" of a language by being born and immersed in the language during youth, in a family in which the adults shared a similar language experience as the child. Native speakers are considered to be an authority on their given language because of their natural acquisition process regarding the language, as opposed to having learned the language later in life. That is achieved by personal interaction with the language and speakers of the language. Native speakers will not necessarily be knowledgeable about every grammatical rule of the language, but they will have good \"intuition\" of the rules through their experience with the language.\n\nSometimes, the term \"mother tongue\" or \"mother language\" is used for the language that a person learned as a child at home (usually from their parents). Children growing up in bilingual homes can, according to this definition, have more than one mother tongue or native language.\n\nIn the context of population censuses conducted on the Canadian population, Statistics Canada defines \"mother tongue\" as \"the first language learned at home in childhood and still understood by the individual at the time of the census.\"\nIt is quite possible that the first language learned is no longer a speaker's dominant language. That includes young immigrant children whose families have moved to a new linguistic environment as well as people who learned their mother tongue as a young child at home (rather than the language of the majority of the community), who may have lost, in part or in totality, the language they first acquired (see language attrition).\n\nAccording to Ivan Illich, the term \"mother tongue\" was first used by Catholic monks to designate a particular language they used, instead of Latin, when they are \"speaking from the pulpit\". That is, the \"holy mother the Church\" introduced this term and colonies inherited it from Christianity as a part of colonialism.\n\nIn some countries, such as Kenya, India, and various East Asian countries, \"mother language\" or \"native language\" is used to indicate the language of one's ethnic group in both common and journalistic parlance (\"I have no apologies for not learning my mother tongue\"), rather than one's first language. Also, in Singapore, \"mother tongue\" refers to the language of one's ethnic group regardless of actual proficiency, and the \"first language\" refers to English, which was established on the island under the British Empire, which is the lingua franca for most post-independence Singaporeans because of its use as the language of instruction in government schools and as a working language.\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien, in his 1955 lecture \"English and Welsh,\" distinguishes the \"native tongue\" from the \"cradle tongue.\" The latter is the language one happens to learn during early childhood, and one's true \"native tongue\" may be different, possibly determined by an inherited linguistic taste and may later in life be discovered by a strong emotional affinity to a specific dialect (Tolkien personally confessed to such an affinity to the Middle English of the West Midlands in particular).\n\nOn 17 November 1999, UNESCO designated 21 February as International Mother Language Day.\n\nThe first language of a child is part of the personal, social and cultural identity. Another impact of the first language is that it brings about the reflection and learning of successful social patterns of acting and speaking. It is basically responsible for differentiating the linguistic competence of acting. While some argue that there is no such thing as \"native speaker\" or a \"mother tongue,\" it is important to understand the key terms as well as understand what it means to be a \"non-native\" speaker and the implications that can have on one's life. Research suggest that while a non-native speaker may develop fluency in a targeted language after about two years of immersion, it can actually take between five and seven years for that child to be on the same working level as their native speaking counterparts. That has implications on the education of non-native speakers.\n\nThe topic of native speaker also gives way to discussion about what exactly bilingualism is. One definition is that a person is bilingual by being equally proficient in both languages. A person who grows up speaking English and begins learning Spanish for four years is not necessarily bilingual unless they speak the two languages with equal fluency. Pearl and Lambert were the first to test only “balanced” bilinguals—that is, a child who is completely fluent in two languages and feel that neither is their “native” language because they grasp the two so perfectly. This study found the following: balanced bilinguals perform significantly better in tasks that require flexibility (they constantly shift between the two known languages depending on the situation/requires constant juggling), more aware of arbitrary nature of language and also that balanced bilinguals choose word associations based on logical rather than phonetic preferences.\n\nOne can have two or more native languages, thus being a native \"bilingual\" or indeed \"multilingual\". The order in which these languages are learned is not necessarily the order of proficiency. For instance, if a French-speaking couple have a child who learned French first but then the child grew up in an English-speaking country, the child would likely be most proficient in English. Other examples are in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Kenya, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa, where most people speak more than one language.\n\nThe designation \"native language,\" in its general usage, is thought to be imprecise and subject to various interpretations that are biased linguistically, especially with respect to bilingual children from ethnic minority groups. Many scholars have given definitions of 'native language' based on common usage, the emotional relation of the speaker towards the language, and even its dominance in relation to the environment. However, all of three criteria lack precision. For many children whose home language differs from the language of the environment (the 'official' language), it is debatable which language is one's 'native language'. \n\n\nThe article titled “The Native Speaker: An Achievable Model?” published by the Asian EFL Journal states that there are six general principles that relate to the definition of \"native speaker\". The principles, according to the study, are typically accepted by language experts across the scientific field. A native speaker is defined according to the guidelines as this:\n\n\n"}

He rebelled against King John (1199–1216) from 1200 to 1203, mainly over a dispute concerning his familial right to Whittington Castle, and was declared an outlaw.\nHe was the subject of the famous mediaeval legend or \"ancestral romance\" entitled \"Fouke le Fitz Waryn\", which relates the story of his life as an outlaw and his struggle to regain his patrimony from the king. He founded, between 1221 and 1226, Alberbury Priory in Shropshire which he granted to the Augustinian canons of Lilleshall but later transferred to the Order of Grandmont. His grandson was Fulk V FitzWarin, 1st Baron FitzWarin (1251–1315).\n\nFulk III was the son of Fulk II FitzWarin (died 1197) by his wife Hawise le Dinan, a daughter and\nco-heiress of Josce de Dinan. Fulk II was a marcher lord of Shropshire, the son and heir of Fulk I FitzWarin (d.1170/1) of Whittington and Alveston, who himself was the son of (i.e. in Norman French \"Fitz\", in modern French \"fils de\") the family's earliest known ancestor, thus deemed the family patriarch, \"Warin of Meer\", from Lorraine.\n\nWarin of Meer the patriarch is however a \"shadowy or mythical figure\", about whom little is certain. The later mediaeval romance \"Fouke le Fitz Waryn\" gives his name as \"Warin de Meer\". Whatever his true place of origin it is however generally believed that the head of the Warin family came to England during the reign of William the Conqueror (1066–1087). Neither the father nor his sons were during that reign tenants-in-chief, that is to say important vassals or feudal barons, rather their grants of lands were obtained from later kings.\n\nFulk I (d.1170/1) was rewarded by King Henry II (1154–1189) for his support of his mother Empress Matilda in her civil war with King Stephen (1135–1154) and conferred to him in 1153 the royal manor of Alveston in Gloucestershire and in 1149 the manor of Whadborough in Leicestershire. Fulk II held those properties after the death of his father in 1171.\n\nAt some time before 1178 Fulk II (d.1197) married Hawise de Dinan, a wealthy heiress, a daughter and co-heiress of Josce de Dinan, who held Ludlow Castle in the Welsh marches for the Empress Matilda during the civil war between herself and King Stephen. Throughout his lifetime he encountered numerous problems in receiving his patrimony and his other claims to land. These land disputes included estates his father held in-chief from the crown and others which he had held from the Peverel family as overlords.\n\nOther lawsuits concerned Whittington Castle held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen. Although he won the right to Whittington in or about 1195, he never received formal legal \"seisin\" and it remained in Welsh hands at the time of his death in 1197.\n\nWhittington Castle lies on the English side of Offa's Dyke, which during the Norman era and before was the border between England and Wales. The site was fortified as a castle by William Peverel in 1138, in support of Empress Matilda, the daughter of King Henry I (1100–1135), in her struggle (known as The Anarchy) for the throne against King Stephen (1135–1154), grandson of William the Conqueror. In the late 1140s the lordship of Whittington, like Oswestry and Overton ceased to be part of England and became part of the Kingdom of Powys and a Welsh marcher lordship. In 1165 Henry II granted the castle of Whittington on Roger de Powis, a Welsh leader, to whom he gave funds for its repair in about 1173. Roger de Powis was followed by his son Meurig (or Maurice), who was followed by his son Werennoc. A rival claim was made by Fulk III FitzWarin (c. 1160–1258).\n\nFulk III continued the claim to Whittington made by his father. After his father's death in 1197 Fulk III offered relief of £100 for the inheritance of Whittington. However Maurice of Powis (d.1200), the son of Roger of Powis, who had offered half that amount, on 11 April 1200 was granted Whittington by King John. Again, after Maurice's death in August 1200, King John granted it to Maurice's heirs.\n\nIt is not known why King John refused to recognise Fulk's claim to Whittington as his rightful inheritance but by April 1201 Fulk was in open rebellion against the King. He was accompanied by approximately fifty-two followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, his cousins, and by the family's many tenants and allies in the Marches.\nFulk's rebellion is not related in detail by chroniclers but was clearly considerable as in the spring of 1201, while King John crossed into Normandy and Poitou to suppress a revolt by the Lusignans, he ordered Hubert de Burgh, with 100 knights, to counter the rebellion of Fulk and William Marsh, a Somersetshire knight who was raiding shipping off the coast of Devon.\n\nIn July 1202 Fulk and his men are reported to have taken refuge in Stanley Abbey in Wiltshire. Another man, Gilbert de Duure, is mentioned in records as \"...having been an outlaw associated with Fulk Fitz Warin\". Yet another, Eustace de Kivilly, was pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".\n\nAfter many years of being an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned together with over thirty of his followers, including his brothers William, Phillip and John and his cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington. Whittington Castle thereafter descended in the FitzWarin family, all subsequent holders bearing the first-name Fulk, until the death of Fulk XI FitzWarin, 7th Baron FitzWarin (1405–1420) in 1420.\n\nIn 1207 Fulk III was clearly highly regarded by many of the king's barons as evidenced by the identity of men known to have provided surety for Fulk's fine of 1,200 marks to marry the heiress daughter of Robert le Vavasur. The suretors included the Peverels, Alan Basset, William de Braose (d.1230), a de Lacy, William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury and Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford.\n\nOn 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for Poitou, Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him. He is believed then to have been a vassal of Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Gloucester.\n\nIn 1215 Fulk was one of many giving great trouble to the Sheriff of Shropshire. Before 1216 and the accession of the infant King Henry III (1216–1272), John's son, Fulk's manor of Alveston had been seized by the crown and in the following year 1217 all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218 however Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered restored by the regents of Henry III.\n\nBy 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington. In 1223 however it fell to Llywelyn the Great, prince of Wales. Fulk regained it the following year although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized.\n\nBy 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.\n\nThroughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales. As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.\n\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n\n\n\n\nFulk III lived to a great age and at some time before his death in 1258, he handed over control of much of his responsibilities to his son and heir Fulk IV. In 1252 he made his will in which he stated his wish to be buried at the priory he founded, Alberbury Priory.\n\nAfter Foulk's death he became the subject the famous \"ancestral romance\" known as Fouke le Fitz Waryn, which contains a highly embellished account of his life and family history.\n\nThe biography of Fulk III survives in a French prose \"ancestral romance\", extant in a manuscript containing English, French and Latin texts, which is based on a lost verse romance. A 16th-century summary of a Middle English version has also been preserved. The work is part of the Matter of England. The outline of the work is as follows. As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King Henry II (1154–1189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King John (1199–1216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of Robin Hood.\n\n"}

The celebration of funeral games was common to a number of ancient civilizations. Athletics and games such as wrestling are depicted on Sumerian statues dating from approximately 2600 BC, and funeral games are depicted in early Greek vases, such as the Francois vase at Florence and the Amphiaraus vase in Berlin. In some accounts, funeral games were not merely held to honor the deceased, but in order to propitiate the spirits of those who had died.\n\nAccording to literary tradition, funeral games were a regular feature of Mycenean Greek society. The \"Iliad\" describes the funeral games held by Achilles in honor of Patroclus, and a similar competition was attributed by Virgil to Aeneas, who held games on the anniversary of his father's death. Many of the contests were similar to those held at the Olympic Games, and although those were held in honor of Zeus, many scholars see the origin of Olympic competition in these earlier funeral games.\nHistorical examples of funeral games in ancient Greece are known from the late sixth century BC until the end of the Hellenistic period. They could celebrate either civic heroes, such as the founders of cities, or private individuals, and in either case might become annual events.\n\nPersons considered heroes sometimes became the focus of hero cults, in which case funeral games might be held as part of their cult ritual. In a civic context, games might be held to honor public figures acclaimed as heroes, or sometimes whole groups of people, such as soldiers from the city who had fallen in battle. It was customary for the participants to be citizens of the towns where the games were held.\n\nOne example of such games was held at Amphipolis, in honor of the Spartan general Brasidas. Brasidas had fallen in battle while capturing the city of Amphipolis during the Pelopponesian War, in 422 BC. After the battle, he became revered as the new founder of the city, displacing Hagnon, who established an Athenian colony there in 437. Subsequently, Brasidas' funeral games became an annual event at Amphipolis.\n\nOn the island of Amorgos in the Cyclades, Aleximachus Critolaus held a series of funeral games at the town of Aigiale in honor of his son, Aleximachus. The celebrations, which became an annual festival, included sacrifices, a banquet, and a variety of athletic competitions for which prizes were awarded. The most important event was the pankration; but the dead Aleximachus was always declared the winner of this competition, suggesting that he had been an athlete himself.\n\nA variety of prizes were awarded to the competitors at Greek funeral games. The most common prize was an olive wreath or crown, made from the branches of a sacred olive tree. This crown was the most revered prize awarded. In the early period, other prizes awarded included useful commodities such as tripods, kettles, double cups, and various farm animals. In later times, precious metals such as gold, silver, bronze, or steel were also awarded.\n\nCompetitions known as Aonachs were held in Ireland in the Bronze Age. The most famous of which was the Aonach Tailteann \"Tailtin Fair\", held at Tailtin (Teltown) in Mide. According to the \"Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland\", the fair was established by the legendary king Lugh Lámhfhada (reigned 1849 to 1809 BC) in honor of his foster-mother, Tailtiu. These games are known to have been held during Ireland's medieval period, perhaps as early as the sixth century, but died out after the Norman Invasion of Ireland in the twelfth century. Some sources date the games themselves to the midpoint of Lugh's reign, in 1829 BC, claiming that they predate the Greek Olympics by over a thousand years, and even that they were the inspiration for the Olympic Games.\n"}

Beginning with simple pre-historic shelters, home construction techniques have evolved to produce the vast multitude of living accommodations available today. Different levels of wealth and power have warranted various sizes, luxuries, and even defenses in a \"home\". Environmental considerations and cultural influences have created an immensely diverse collection of architectural styles. From castles to mud thatches, mansions to shanties, the 'home' has grown to represent a seemingly limitless array of structures.\n\nWhile homes may have originated in pre-history, there are many notable stages through which cultures pass to reach the current level of modernization. Countries and communities throughout the world currently exhibit very diverse concepts of housing, at many different stages of home development.\n\nTwo methods for constructing a home can be distinguished: the method in which architects simply assume free choice of materials and parts, and the method in which reclaimed materials are used, and the house is thus during its entire construction a \"work in progress\" (meaning every single aspect of it is subject to change at any given time, depending on what materials are found).\n\nThe second method has been used throughout history, as materials have always been scarce. Nowadays, more advanced sourcing maps (such as the Superuse.org materials map) have become available.\n\nThe modern family home has many more systems and facets of construction than one might initially believe. With sufficient study, an average person can understand everything there is to know about any given phase of home construction. The \"do it yourself\" (DIY) boom of the late twentieth century was due, in large part, to this fact.

Had it not been for the monastic scribes of Late Antiquity, most literature of Greece and Rome would have perished. As it was, the patterns of textual survivals were shaped by their usefulness to the severely constricted literate group of Christians. Illumination of manuscripts, as a way of aggrandizing ancient documents, aided their preservation and informative value in an era when new ruling classes were no longer literate, at least in the language used in the manuscripts.\n\nThe majority of extant manuscripts are from the Middle Ages, although many survive from the Renaissance, along with a very limited number from Late Antiquity. The majority are of a religious nature. Especially from the 13th century onward, an increasing number of secular texts were illuminated. Most illuminated manuscripts were created as codices, which had superseded scrolls. A very few illuminated fragments survive on papyrus, which does not last nearly as long as vellum or parchment. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on parchment (most commonly of calf, sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts important enough to illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called vellum.\n\nBeginning in the Late Middle Ages, manuscripts began to be produced on paper. Very early printed books were sometimes produced with spaces left for rubrics and miniatures, or were given illuminated initials, or decorations in the margin, but the introduction of printing rapidly led to the decline of illumination. Illuminated manuscripts continued to be produced in the early 16th century but in much smaller numbers, mostly for the very wealthy. They are among the most common items to survive from the Middle Ages; many thousands survive. They are also the best surviving specimens of medieval painting, and the best preserved. Indeed, for many areas and time periods, they are the only surviving examples of painting.\n\nArt historians classify illuminated manuscripts into their historic periods and types, including (but not limited to) Late Antique, Insular, Carolingian manuscripts, Ottonian manuscripts, Romanesque manuscripts, Gothic manuscripts, and Renaissance manuscripts. There are a few examples from later periods. The type of book most often heavily and richly illuminated, sometimes known as a \"display book\", varied between periods. In the first millennium, these were most likely to be Gospel Books, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells. The Romanesque period saw the creation of many large illuminated complete Bibles – one in Sweden requires three librarians to lift it. Many Psalters were also heavily illuminated in both this and the Gothic period. Single cards or posters of vellum, leather or paper were in wider circulation with short stories or legends on them about the lives of saints, chivalry knights or other mythological figures, even criminal, social or miraculous occurrences; popular events much freely used by story tellers and itinerant actors to support their plays. Finally, the Book of Hours, very commonly the personal devotional book of a wealthy layperson, was often richly illuminated in the Gothic period. Other books, both liturgical and not, continued to be illuminated at all periods. \n\nThe Byzantine world produced manuscripts in its own style, versions of which spread to other Orthodox and Eastern Christian areas. The Muslim World and in particular the Iberian Peninsula, with their traditions of literacy uninterrupted by the Middle Ages, were instrumental in delivering ancient classic works to the growing intellectual circles and universities of Western Europe all through the 12th century, as books were produced there in large numbers and on paper for the first time in Europe, and with them full treatises on the sciences, especially astrology and medicine where illumination was required to have profuse and accurate representations with the text.\n\nThe Gothic period, which generally saw an increase in the production of these artifacts, also saw more secular works such as chronicles and works of literature illuminated. Wealthy people began to build up personal libraries; Philip the Bold probably had the largest personal library of his time in the mid-15th century, is estimated to have had about 600 illuminated manuscripts, whilst a number of his friends and relations had several dozen.\nUp to the 12th century, most manuscripts were produced in monasteries in order to add to the library or after receiving a commission from a wealthy patron. Larger monasteries often contained separate areas for the monks who specialized in the production of manuscripts called a scriptorium. Within the walls of a scriptorium were individualized areas where a monk could sit and work on a manuscript without being disturbed by his fellow brethren. If no scriptorium was available, then “separate little rooms were assigned to book copying; they were situated in such a way that each scribe had to himself a window open to the cloister walk.” The separation of these monks from the rest of the cloister indicates just how revered these monks were within their society.\n\nBy the 14th century, the cloisters of monks writing in the scriptorium had almost fully given way to commercial urban scriptoria, especially in Paris, Rome and the Netherlands. While the process of creating an illuminated manuscript did not change, the move from monasteries to commercial settings was a radical step. Demand for manuscripts grew to an extent that Monastic libraries began to employ secular scribes and illuminators. These individuals often lived close to the monastery and, in instances, dressed as monks whenever they entered the monastery, but were allowed to leave at the end of the day. In reality, illuminators were often well known and acclaimed and many of their identities have survived.\n\nFirst, the manuscript was “sent to the rubricator, who added (in red or other colors) the titles, headlines, the initials of chapters and sections, the notes and so on; and then – if the book was to be illustrated – it was sent to the illuminator.” In the case of manuscripts that were sold commercially, the writing would “undoubtedly have been discussed initially between the patron and the scribe (or the scribe’s agent,) but by the time that the written gathering were sent off to the illuminator there was no longer any scope for innovation.”\n\nIllumination was a complex and frequently costly process. It was usually reserved for special books: an altar Bible, for example. Wealthy people often had richly illuminated \"books of hours\" made, which set down prayers appropriate for various times in the liturgical day.\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, most books were produced in monasteries, whether for their own use, for presentation, or for a commission. However, commercial scriptoria grew up in large cities, especially Paris, and in Italy and the Netherlands, and by the late 14th century there was a significant industry producing manuscripts, including agents who would take long-distance commissions, with details of the heraldry of the buyer and the saints of personal interest to him (for the calendar of a Book of hours). By the end of the period, many of the painters were women, perhaps especially in Paris.\n\nThe text was usually written before the manuscripts were illuminated. Sheets of parchment or vellum were cut down to the appropriate size. After the general layout of the page was planned (including the initial capitals and borders), the page was lightly ruled with a pointed stick, and the scribe went to work with ink-pot and either sharpened quill feather or reed pen. The script depended on local customs and tastes. The sturdy Roman letters of the early Middle Ages gradually gave way to scripts such as Uncial and half-Uncial, especially in the British Isles, where distinctive scripts such as insular majuscule and insular minuscule developed. Stocky, richly textured blackletter was first seen around the 13th century and was particularly popular in the later Middle Ages.\n\nPrior to the days of such careful planning, “A typical black-letter page of these Gothic years would show a page in which the lettering was cramped and crowded into a format dominated by huge ornamented capitals that descended from uncial forms or by illustrations.” To prevent such poorly made manuscripts and illuminations from occurring a script was typically supplied first, “and blank spaces were left for the decoration. This pre-supposes very careful planning by the scribe even before he put pen to parchment.” If the scribe and the illuminator were separate labors the planning period allowed for adequate space to be given to each individual.\n\nThe following steps outline the detailed labor involved to create the illuminations of one page of a manuscript:\n\nThe illumination and decoration was normally planned at the inception of the work, and space reserved for it. However, the text was usually written before illumination began. In the Early Medieval period the text and illumination were often done by the same people, normally monks, but by the High Middle Ages the roles were typically separated, except for routine initials and flourishes, and by at least the 14th century there were secular workshops producing manuscripts, and by the beginning of the 15th century these were producing most of the best work, and were commissioned even by monasteries. When the text was complete, the illustrator set to work. Complex designs were planned out beforehand, probably on wax tablets, the sketch pad of the era. The design was then traced or drawn onto the vellum (possibly with the aid of pinpricks or other markings, as in the case of the Lindisfarne Gospels). Many incomplete manuscripts survive from most periods, giving us a good idea of working methods.\n\nAt all times, most manuscripts did not have images in them. In the early Middle Ages, manuscripts tend to either be display books with very full illumination, or manuscripts for study with at most a few decorated initials and flourishes. By the Romanesque period many more manuscripts had decorated or historiated initials, and manuscripts essentially for study often contained some images, often not in color. This trend intensified in the Gothic period, when most manuscripts had at least decorative flourishes in places, and a much larger proportion had images of some sort. Display books of the Gothic period in particular had very elaborate decorated borders of foliate patterns, often with small drolleries. A Gothic page might contain several areas and types of decoration: a miniature in a frame, a historiated initial beginning a passage of text, and a border with drolleries. Often different artists worked on the different parts of the decoration.\n\nWhile the use of gold is by far one of the most captivating features of illuminated manuscripts, the bold use of varying colors provided multiple layers of dimension to the illumination. From a religious perspective, \"the diverse colors wherewith the book is illustrated, not unworthily represent the multiple grace of heavenly wisdom.\" While religious authors view themselves as instilling a part of God's vast glory on the work, many illustrations can be linked to \"the history of the texts that were required to be illustrated and the needs and tastes of the readers of those manuscripts.\" Color brought the images on the page to life and captivated the readers. Without color the impact of the image would have been completely lost.\n\nThe medieval artist's palette was broad; a partial list of pigments is given below. In addition, unlikely-sounding substances such as urine and earwax were used to prepare pigments.\n\nA manuscript is not considered illuminated unless one or many illuminations contained gold foil or was brushed with gold specks, a process known as \"burnishing\". The inclusion of gold alludes to many different possibilities for the text. If the text is of religious nature the gold is a sign of exalting the text. In the early centuries of Christianity, “Gospel manuscripts were sometimes written entirely in gold.” Aside from adding flashy decoration to the text, scribes during the time considered themselves to be praising God with their use of gold. In one particular instance, “The life of Christ executed on gold backgrounds with much greater richness in the midst of innumerable scenes of the chase, tourneys, games and grotesque subjects.” Furthermore, gold was used if a patron who had commissioned a book to be written wished to display the vastness of his riches. Eventually, the addition of gold to manuscripts became so frequent, “that its value as a barometer of status with the manuscript was degraded.” During this time period the price of gold had become so cheap that its inclusion in an illuminated manuscript accounted for only a tenth of the cost of production. By adding richness and depth to the manuscript, the use of gold in illuminations created pieces of art that are still valued today.\n\nThe application of gold leaf or dust to an illumination is a very detailed process that only the most skilled illuminators can undertake and successfully achieve. The first detail an illuminator considered when dealing with gold was whether to use gold leaf or specks of gold that could be applied with a brush. When working with gold leaf the pieces would be hammered and thinned until they were “thinner than the thinnest paper.” The use of this type of leaf allowed for numerous areas of the text to be outlined in gold. There were several ways of applying gold to an illumination one of the most popular included mixing the gold with stag’s glue and then “pour it into water and dissolve it with your finger.” Once the gold was soft and malleable in the water it was ready to be applied to the page. Illuminators had to be very careful when applying gold leaf to the manuscript. Gold leaf is able to \"adhere to any pigment which had already been laid, ruining the design, and secondly the action of burnishing it is vigorous and runs the risk of smudging any painting already around it.\"\n\nMonasteries produced manuscripts for their own use; heavily illuminated ones tended to be reserved for liturgical use in the early period, while the monastery library held plainer texts. In the early period manuscripts were often commissioned by rulers for their own personal use or as diplomatic gifts, and many old manuscripts continued to be given in this way, even into the Early Modern period. Especially after the book of hours became popular, wealthy individuals commissioned works as a sign of status within the community, sometimes including donor portraits or heraldry: \"In a scene from the New Testament, Christ would be shown larger than an apostle, who would be bigger than a mere bystander in the picture, while the humble donor of the painting or the artist himself might appear as a tiny figure in the corner.\" The calendar was also personalized, recording the feast days of local or family saints. By the end of the Middle Ages many manuscripts were produced for distribution through a network of agents, and blank spaces might be reserved for the appropriate heraldry to be added locally by the buyer.\n\nDisplaying the amazing detail and richness of a text, the addition of illumination was never an afterthought. The inclusion of illumination is twofold, it added value to the work, but more importantly it provides pictures for the illiterate members of society to \"make the reading seem more vivid and perhaps more credible.”\n\n\n\n"}

An alternative name of this tribe and its language is \"Bugkalot\". They are known as a tribe of headhunters.\n\nPresently, there are about 87,000 Ilongots. The Ilongots tend to inhabit areas close to rivers, as they provide a food source and a means for transportation. Their native language is the Ilongot language, currently spoken by about 50,000 people. They also speak the Ilocano language.\n\nIn Ivan Salva’s study in 1980 of the Ilongots, she described “gender differences related to the positive cultural value placed on adventure, travel, and knowledge of the external world.” Ilongot men, more often than women, visited distant places. They acquired knowledge of the outside world, amassed experiences there, and returned in order to share their knowledge, adventures, and feelings in a public oratory in order to pass on their knowledge to others. The Ilongot men received acclaim as a result of their experiences. Because they lacked external experience on which to base knowledge and expression, Ilongot women had inferior prestige. \n\nOn the basis of Michelle Rosaldo’s study and findings of other stateless societies, anthropologists must distinguish between prestige systems and actual power within a society. Just because a male has a high level of prestige, he may not own much economic or political power compared to others that are less prestigious within the society. \n\nRenato Rosaldo went on to study headhunting among the Ilongots in his book \"Ilongot Headhunting, 1883-1974: A Study in Society and History\". He notes headhunting raids are often associated with bereavement, a rage and expiation at the loss of a loved one. \n\nBecause of the early experiences of boys living in a close relationship with both parents, who each participate in \"motherly\" roles, they are relatively unconcerned about the need for achievement or even defaming women. Men involved in household chores do not claim submission to their wives. In social life, the Ilongots show little stratification and sexual inequality but it is certainly present. It is minimized by the fact that women have the right, as well as feel confident enough, to speak their minds. Finally, we find the home gender relations based on equality, focusing on cooperation instead of competition and there is a real intimacy between husband and wife. Rosaldo's conclusion is that perhaps the most egalitarian societies are those where no sex order authority exists, and where the focus of social life itself is the home.\n\nAccording to the Ilongot people, the creators of the universe are two quarrelling brothers. There original names have been lost due to the introduction of Roman Catholicism by the Spanish in the 16th to 19th centuries. Some people nowadays refer to them as Cain and Abel, which were taken from the bible, but are not their true names. Abel was a shepherd who is known to have been looked upon favourably due to his propensity to self-sacrifice. While Cain who worked in agriculture was known for his inclination towards chaos.\n\nThe Ilongot people identify those who live down in the lowlands as following the spirit of Abel. They view them as superior as well as having had learned to work with the domesticated animals such as Carabao. The Ilongot see themselves as following in the footsteps of Cain and his spirit of chaos. However, many sources conflict with this as the story may have been crafted decades ago by a Spanish implying that the lowlanders are 'more civilized' because they are 'Christians', which demeans the Ilongots and their own culture. Due to this, many Ilongots reject the side story of Cain and Abel.\n\nDeities without Catholic renditions known to the Ilongots are:\n\nNPR Listen to: High Voltage (Emotions Part 2) - Liget \n"}

Unless otherwise noted, statements in this article refer to South Korean standard language based on the Seoul dialect.\n\nMorphophonemes are written inside vertical pipes (), phonemes inside slashes (), and allophones inside brackets ().\n\nKorean has 19 consonant phonemes.\n\nFor each stop and affricate, there is a three-way contrast between unvoiced segments, which are distinguished as plain, tense, and aspirated.\nNorth Koreans pronounce , as , \nThe IPA diacritic , resembling a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle, is used to denote the tensed consonants . Its official use in the Extensions to the IPA is for strong articulation, but is used in literature for faucalized voice. The Korean consonants also have elements of stiff voice, but it is not yet known how typical that is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted glottis and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.\n\nAn alternative analysis proposes that the \"tensed\" series of sounds are (fundamentally) regular voiceless, unaspirated consonants: the \"lax\" sounds are voiced consonants that become devoiced initially, and the primary distinguishing feature between word-initial \"lax\" and \"tensed\" consonants is that initial lax sounds cause the following vowel to assume a low-to-high pitch contour, a feature reportedly associated with voiced consonants in many Asian languages, whereas tensed (and also aspirated) consonants are associated with a uniformly high pitch.\n\nThe analysis of as phonologically plain or aspirated has been a source of controversy in the literature. Its characteristics are nearest to those of plain stops, as it generally undergoes intervocalic voicing word-medially. It shows moderate aspiration word-initially, but no aspiration word-medially. are palatalized before .\n\nBetween vowels, may either be voiced to or deleted.\n\nKorean consonants have three principal positional allophones: initial, medial (voiced), and final (checked). The initial form is found at the beginning of phonological words. The medial form is found in voiced environments, intervocalically and after a voiced consonant such as or . The final form is found in checked environments such as at the end of a phonological word or before an obstruent consonant such as or . Nasal consonants (, , ) do not have noticeable positional allophones beyond initial denasalization, and cannot appear in this position.\n\nThe table below is out of alphabetical order to make the relationships between the consonants explicit:\n\nAll obstruents (stops, affricates, fricatives) become stops with no audible release at the end of a word: all coronals collapse to , all labials to , and all velars to . Final is a lateral or .\n\nIn native Korean words, does not occur word initially, unlike in Chinese loans (Sino-Korean vocabulary). In South Korea, it is silent in initial position before and , pronounced before other vowels, and pronounced only in compound words after a vowel. The prohibition on word-initial is called the \"initial law\" or (). Initial is officially pronounced in North Korea. In both countries, initial in words of foreign origin other than Chinese is pronounced .\n\n\nThis rule also extends to in many native and all Sino-Korean words, which is also lost before initial and in South Korean; again, North Korean preserves the phoneme there. \n\n\nKorean has eight vowel phonemes and a length distinction for each. Long vowels are pronounced somewhat more peripherally than short ones. Two more vowels, the mid front rounded vowel ( ) and the close front rounded vowel ( ), can still be heard in the speech of some older speakers, but they have been largely replaced by the diphthongs and , respectively. In a 2003 survey of 350 speakers from Seoul, nearly 90% pronounced the vowel as .\n\nIn 2012, vowel length is reported almost completely neutralized in Korean, except for a very few older speakers of Seoul dialect, for whom the distinctive vowel-length distinction is maintained only in the first syllable of a word.\n\nThe distinction between and is lost in South Korean dialects but robust in North Korean dialects. For the speakers who do not make the difference, seems to be the dominant form. For most of the speakers who still utilize vowel length contrastively, long is actually . In Seoul Korean, is produced higher than , while in Pyongan, is lower than . In Northeastern Korean tonal dialect, the two are comparable in height and the main contrast is along pitch. Within Seoul Korean, is raised toward while is fronted away from in younger speakers’ speech.\n\nMiddle Korean had an additional vowel phoneme denoted by , known as (literally \"lower a\"). The vowel merged with in all mainland varieties of Korean but remains distinct in Jeju, where it is pronounced .\n\nBecause they may follow consonants in initial position in a word, which no other consonant can do, and also because of Hangul orthography, which transcribes them as vowels, semivowels such as and are sometimes considered to be elements of rising diphthongs rather than separate consonant phonemes.\n\nIn current pronunciation, merges into after a consonant. Some analyses treat as a central vowel and thus the marginal sequence as having a central-vowel onset, which would be more accurately transcribed or .\n\nModern Korean has no falling diphthongs, with sequences like being considered as two separate vowels in hiatus. Middle Korean had a full set of diphthongs ending in , which monophthongized into the front vowels in Early Modern Korean (, , , , ). This is the reason why the hangul letters , , and so on are represented as back vowels plus .\n\nThe vowel that most affects consonants is , which, along with its semivowel homologue , palatalizes and to alveolo-palatal and for most speakers (but see differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea). As noted above, initial is silent in this palatalizing environment, at least in South Korea. Similarly, an underlying or at the \"end\" of a morpheme becomes a phonemically palatalized affricate when followed by a word or suffix beginning with or (it becomes indistinguishable from an underlying ), but that does not happen within native Korean words such as \"where?\".\n\nIn many morphological processes, a vowel before another vowel may become the semivowel . Likewise, and , before another vowel, may reduce to . In some dialects and speech registers, the semivowel assimilates into a following or and produces the front rounded vowels and .\n\nAs noted above, tenuis stops and are voiced after the voiced consonants , and the resulting voiced tends to be elided. Tenuis stops become fortis after obstruents (which, as noted above, are reduced to ); that is, is pronounced . Fortis and nasal stops are unaffected by either environment, though assimilates to after an . After , tenuis stops become aspirated, becomes fortis, and is unaffected. is highly affected: it becomes after all consonants but (which assimilates to the instead) or another . For example, underlying is pronounced .\n\nThese are all \"progressive\" assimilation. Korean also has regressive (anticipatory) assimilation: a consonant tends to assimilate in manner but not in place of articulation: Obstruents become nasal stops before nasal stops (which, as just noted, includes underlying ), but do not change their position in the mouth. Velar stops (that is, all consonants pronounced in final position) become ; coronals () become , and labials () become . For example, is pronounced (phonetically ).\n\nBefore the fricatives , coronal obstruents assimilate to a fricative, resulting in a geminate. That is, is pronounced (). A final assimilates in both place and manner, so that is pronounced as a geminate (and, as noted above, aspirated if C is a stop). The two coronal sonorants, and , in whichever order, assimilate to , so that both and are pronounced .\n\nThere are lexical exceptions to these generalizations. For example, voiced consonants occasionally cause a following consonant to become fortis rather than voiced; this is especially common with and as and , but is also occasionally seen with other sequences, such as (), () and ().\n\n\nThe resulting geminate obstruents, such as , , , and (that is, , , , and ), tend to reduce (, , , ) in rapid conversation. Heterorganic obstruent sequences such as and may, less frequently, assimilate to geminates (, ) and also reduce (, ).\n\nThese sequences assimilate with following vowels the way single consonants do, so that for example and palatalize to (that is, ) before and ; and affricate to and before ; , , and palatalize to and across morpheme boundaries, and so on.\n\nHangul orthography does not generally reflect these assimilatory processes, but rather maintains the underlying morphology in most cases.\n\nKorean syllable structure is maximally /CGVC/, where /G/ is a glide . Any consonant except may occur initially, but only may occur finally. Sequences of two consonants may occur between vowels, as outlined above. However, morphemes may also end in CC clusters, which are both expressed only when they are followed by a vowel. When the morpheme is not suffixed, one of the consonants is not expressed; if there is a , which cannot appear in final position, it will be that. Otherwise it will be a coronal consonant (with the exception of ㄼ), and if the sequence is two coronals, the voiceless one () will drop, and or will remain. Thus, no sequence reduces to in final position.\n\nWhen such a sequence is followed by a consonant, the same reduction takes place, but a trace of the lost consonant may remain in its effect on the following consonant. The effects are the same as in a sequence between vowels: an elided obstruent will leave the third consonant fortis, if it is a stop, and an elided will leave it aspirated. Most conceivable combinations do not actually occur; a few examples are = , = , = , = , = , = ; also = , as has no effect on a following , and = , with the dropping out.\n\nWhen the second and third consonants are homorganic obstruents, they merge, becoming fortis or aspirate, and, depending on the word and a preceding , might not elide: is .\n\nAn elided has no effect: = , = , = , = , = , = , = , = , = , = , = .\n\nAmong vowels, the sequences do not occur, and it is not possible to write them using standard hangul. The semivowel occurs only in the diphthong , and is prone to being deleted after a consonant. There are no offglides in Korean; historical diphthongs have become modern monophthongs .\n\nTraditionally, the Korean language has had strong vowel harmony; that is, in pre-modern Korean, not only did the inflectional and derivational affixes (such as postpositions) change in accordance to the main root vowel, but native words also adhered to vowel harmony. It is not as prevalent in modern usage, although it remains strong in onomatopoeia, adjectives and adverbs, interjections, and conjugation. There are also other traces of vowel harmony in Korean.\n\nThere are three classes of vowels in Korean: positive, negative, and neutral. The vowel (eu) is considered partially a neutral and negative vowel. The vowel classes loosely follow the negative and positive vowels; they also follow orthography. Exchanging positive vowels with negative vowels usually creates different nuances of meaning, with positive vowels sounding diminutive and negative vowels sounding crude:\n\n\nSeveral dialects outside Seoul retain the Middle Korean pitch accent system. In the dialect of Northern Gyeongsang, in southeastern South Korea, any syllable may have pitch accent in the form of a high tone, as may the two initial syllables. For example, in trisyllabic words, there are four possible tone patterns:\n\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\n"}

The show was created and produced by Irwin Allen. \"Land of the Giants\" was the fourth of Allen's science fiction TV series. The show was aired on ABC and released by 20th Century Fox Television. The series was filmed entirely in color and ran for 51 episodes. The show starred Gary Conway and special guest star Kurt Kasznar.\n\nFive novels based on the television series, including three written by acclaimed science fiction author Murray Leinster, were published in 1968 and 1969.\n\nSet fifteen years in the then future year 1983, the series tells the tale of the crew and passengers of a sub-orbital transport ship named \"Spindrift\". In the pilot episode, the \"Spindrift\" is en route from Los Angeles to London, on an ultra fast sub-orbital flight. Just beyond Earth's boundary with space, the \"Spindrift\" encounters a magnetic space storm, and is dragged through a space warp to a mysterious planet where everything is twelve times larger than on Earth, whose inhabitants the Earthlings nickname \"the Giants.\" The \"Spindrift\" crash-lands, and the damage renders it inoperable.\n\nVery little is known about the home planet of the Giants. This is partially because the \"Spindrift\" crew very seldom leave the area where their spaceship crashes in the opening episode. Only two other (unidentified) giant societies are ever seen, in the episodes \"The Land of the Lost\" and \"The Secret City of Limbo.\"\n\nNo name is ever established for the mysterious planet, but the inhabitants seem to know of Earth, Venus and Mars, referring to them by name in one episode. Exactly where the planet is located is also never made clear. In the episode \"On a Clear Night You Can See Earth,\" Captain Steve Burton (Gary Conway) claims to have seen Earth through a set of infrared goggles invented by the giants, implying that the two planets are near enough to see one from the other. The only established method by which Earth people may reach the giants' planet is high-altitude flight, passing through what one giant calls a \"dimension lock\".\n\nAlthough various episodes establish that at least six other flights have landed on the planet, no episode confirms anyone ever returning to Earth. The first mention of other visitors from Earth was in episode 2, \"Ghost Town,\" in which another ship was said to have crashed long ago without any survivors. In episode 4, \"Underground,\" another Earth ship is described as crashing three years previously, again with no survivors.\n\nSeveral episodes show crews surviving the initial crash, only to be killed later. The episode \"Brainwash\" has a crew of little people surviving long enough to build a radio station that can communicate with Earth. They are killed shortly after that. The episodes \"Golden Cage\" and \"The Lost Ones\" show there have been a few survivors of other crashes. Only the \"Spindrift\" crew seems to have survived for long with its party intact.\n\nOne continent, or hemisphere, is dominated by an authoritarian government which tolerates full freedoms within a capitalist system, but it does not tolerate any effort to effect political change. Exactly what the political situation is on other continents is not known, although at least one overseas land has a despotic ruler. The Air Traffic Control tells those who venture out to sea that they should turn back, that nothing beyond that sea has been explored nor is there current contact; whether this is an official government line or the truth is not known.\n\nCulturally, the Giant society closely resembles the contemporary United States of 1968 (in various episodes it has a police force, private hospitals, prisons, a State Governor, radio and television services, a zoo, jazz clubs, even a racetrack - and the Giants speak English, drive American cars, attend Vaudeville-style theatres, and even play chess). The Earth people find themselves able to cope, and their efforts to get around are facilitated by the ubiquity of large drains leading directly from interior rooms to the pavement, in an outside wall of most buildings. The Giant government has offered a reward for the capture of the small Earth people (whom the Giants call \"the little people\").\n\nIn spite of the authoritarianism, there are several dissident movements at work that either help other dissenters (such as the Earth people) or are actively working to unseat the ruling party. The government has established the SID, Special Investigations Department, to deal with assorted dissidents but it also takes the lead in dealing with the Earth people. The Giant technology mostly resembles mid-20th century Earth, but inconsistently: significantly more advanced in some episodes (e.g. cloning, cybernetics, force fields, magnetic stunners, androids, and teleporters) and slightly behind in others (no microelectronics, hearing aids, or manned space flight).\n\nThe little people's objectives are: (1) survival, by obtaining food and avoiding capture by the Giants or attacks from animals, such as cats and dogs; and (2) repair of their spacecraft, so they can attempt to return to Earth. They largely manage to survive by the help of sympathizers and stealth, making the most of their small size, plus their ingenuity in using their technology where it's superior to that of the Giants.\n\nThey do not achieve the second objective, as the primary systems of the craft are severely damaged, although in some episodes (including \"The Flight Plan\") Burton implies it is only a lack of fuel which prevents the ship lifting off. The secondary systems are insufficient to enable them to achieve the sub-orbital flight required. They are unable to use Giant technology, as it is bulky and less advanced; in one episode an experimental nuclear reactor, provided by an engineering student, produces dangerous side effects and is prone to overloading. They also cannot trust the Giants, who in another episode (\"Target: Earth\") offer the little people a ride home in exchange for technical assistance with their space program, but then double-cross them.\n\nThey are aided in the first goal, and at least somewhat hindered in the second, by the leadership of Captain Burton. He behaves as a leader, and as protector to the passengers and crew, and his leadership has rescued them from some difficulties. But Burton also tries to keep the Giants from ever reaching Earth. In the episode \"Brainwash,\" Giant police officer Ashim (Warren Stevens) says \"Maybe we can find the home planet of these little people. It may be a very tiny world, but rich beyond our dreams.\" In several episodes, Burton puts keeping the Giants away from Earth above the need to get his people home. At the end of those episodes, he destroys devices that would get the \"Spindrift\" back to Earth but which would probably enable the Giants to journey there too.\n\nEpisodes often have the Giants capturing one of the passengers or crew, with the rest having to effect a rescue. The Earth people avoid capture most of the time, because their spaceship is hidden in a wood (in several episodes, described by the Giants as a park) outside the city limits. They also occasionally form alliances with individual Giants for some common beneficial purpose.\n\nThe show had no proper conclusion about the humans' attempts to return to Earth, and the final episode, \"Graveyard of Fools,\" was a universal tale that could have taken place anytime in the second season. The penultimate episode, \"Wild Journey\" (guest starring Bruce Dern), has Steve and Dan using alien technology to travel back in time to Earth just a few hours before their ill-fated flight. In a storyline lifted from the \"Lost In Space\" episode \"The Time Merchant,\" they attempt to alter the timeline but only succeed in ensuring that the events of the first episode, \"The Crash,\" take place (footage from the pilot, where \"Spindrift\" becomes lost, is included in this episode), creating a \"Twilight Zone\"-style twist ending, with the impression of a recurring cycle of inevitable events. This episode would have been more effective as the final episode of the season, mirroring Irwin Allen's earlier series \"The Time Tunnel,\" in which the events of the final episode return the characters to their starting point in the pilot episode, \"Rendezvous with Yesterday\"; and \"Land of the Giants\" makes more sense with \"Wild Journey\" switched for \"Graveyard of Fools\" in reruns.\n\nThe first season comprised a regular 26 episodes, but season two was left one episode short, having only 25 episodes, leaving the impression that \"Graveyard of Fools\" was not originally intended to be the final episode of the Season. The show thus comprises only 51 episodes (or 52 episodes including the unaired pilot).\n\nThe show was created by Irwin Allen. With a budget of US$250,000 per episode, \"Land of the Giants\" set a new record. The actors had to be physically fit, as they had to do many stunts, such as climbing giant curbs, phone cords and ropes. Don Marshall, who played the part of Dan Ericson, credited his previous football, track and pole vaulting work for helping him with the stunts required.\n\nElements of Allen's \"Lost in Space\" series recur in \"Land of the Giants\", notably the relationship between foolish, greedy, on-the-run bank robber Alexander B. Fitzhugh (Kurt Kasznar) and the young boy Barry Lockridge (Stefan Arngrim), paralleling the relationship on \"Lost in Space\" between Doctor Smith and the young Will Robinson. Also, for main cast billing, Kasznar was treated contractually in the same manner as Jonathan Harris had been on \"Lost In Space\": billed in last place on the opening credit sequence, but billed as \"Special Guest Star\" (even though he was a series regular). Apart from this, Gary Conway received solo star billing in the opening credits, with the other regulars all receiving \"also starring\" billing.\n\nThe show was originally intended to premiere as a mid-season replacement in the spring of 1968, and the first 12 episodes were shot in the fall of 1967. This was changed and \"Giants\" premiered in September 1968 for a full season. The network screened the episodes in a significantly different order to the production sequence. This caused disconcerting lapses in continuity, since in the first 12 episodes filmed (but not in later episodes) the Giants moved slowly and hardly spoke. For example, \"Ghost Town\" was the 14th episode filmed (i.e. was \"not\" one of the original 12 episodes), but was the second episode aired.\nThe cost of production was immense, partly because of the special optical effects needed to matte the little people into shots also showing the giants; and partly because of the gigantic mechanical props needed, for the little people to interact with, in shots depicting the giant-sized world they find themselves in; plus the futuristic spacecraft sets that were needed to represent the \"Spindrift\". Because of the enormous cost, it was more efficient and cost-effective to film episodes in pairs using the same sets; so writers were informed about what giant-size props there were available, which they could incorporate into their storylines. These episodes were filmed back-to-back.\n\nTo save on production costs, Allen was not above using the same device he had employed on \"The Time Tunnel\": re-using stock footage from 20th Century Fox's film library. For instance, in the episode \"Collector's Item\", footage of Wayne Manor from \"Batman\" is recycled as the luxury mansion home of a rich giant.\n\nIn the unaired pilot of \"The Crash\", there is no end scene with the giant dog in the garbage dump. Once it had been confirmed that \"Land of the Giants\" had been picked up by the network, the pilot was reworked and production began on succeeding episodes. However, a break in production occurred after 12 episodes were in the can (enough for a short run as a mid-season replacement), until the show received the green light on the decision to launch it as a full season the following fall.\n\n\n\"Land of the Giants\" guest stars included many familiar faces from other 1950s and 1960s sci-fi/fantasy and adventure series (e.g. \"Star Trek\", \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Gilligan's Island\", \"Lost in Space\", \"I Dream of Jeannie\"). These popular, well-known character actors included Jack Albertson, Chris Alcaide, Michael Ansara, John Carradine, Yvonne Craig, Charles Drake, Alan Hale, Jr, Jonathan Harris, David Opatoshu, Larry Pennell and Warren Stevens.\n\nLike Allen's previous series \"Lost in Space\" and \"The Time Tunnel\", the theme music was composed by John Williams. As with \"Lost in Space\", Williams composed two different themes (in this case one for each season). Williams also scored the pilot episode \"The Crash,\" and was the third composer to be attached to the project - Williams' work replaced a rejected score and theme by Alexander Courage; Joseph Mullendore composed a second theme that was also thrown out. Mullendore later scored five episodes and Courage did one, with other episodes scored by Richard LaSalle (seven episodes), Leith Stevens (five), Harry Geller (four), Irving Gertz, Paul Sawtell and Robert Prince (one each).\n\nGNP Crescendo released an album as part of \"The Fantasy Worlds Of Irwin Allen\", featuring both themes, Williams' replacement score (tracks 2-6) and Courage's thrown-out score (tracks 9 and 10) for \"The Crash.\"\n\n\nAll 51 episodes were released on DVD in Region 1 in a limited-edition 9-disc Complete Series on July 24, 2007 from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. This includes the un-aired original pilot, which has some differences (extra scenes but not others later added to the aired version) and score music familiar to Lost In Space fans and interviews with cast members.\n\nIn Region 2, Revelation Films has released the entire series on DVD in the UK. Season 1 was released on March 28, 2011 and season 2 on June 13, 2011. They also released a complete series set on March 12, 2012.\n\nIn Region 4, Madman Entertainment released season 1 on DVD in Australia on August 20, 2014.\n\nThe pilot episode was the subject of a View-Master reel and booklet set in 1968 (GAF Packet # B494). One notable difference between the aired episode and the reel set is an image of the \"Spindrift\" flying through the giant forest in apparent daylight. In the aired episode, the \"Spindrift\" arrives on the giants' planet during the night, and its flight through the forest also occurs that same night. Though the following is unconfirmed, either the daylight shot was a special effects sequence cut from the aired pilot, or a special setup for the View Master photographers.\n\nIn 1968, Pyramid Books published an extended novel adaptation of the pilot (\"Land of the Giants\", Pyramid Books, X-1846), written by famed author Murray Leinster. Among notable changes or inventions is that the Spindrift is still an operational, flying ship after the initial crash, with enough \"atomic power\" to last as much as several months. Another invention for the novel is the knowledge that two other ships, the \"Anne\" and \"Marintha\", disappeared via the same mysterious phenomenon that sends the \"Spindrift\" to the giants' planet. The \"Spindrift\" castaways encounter a female survivor of the \"Anne\", named Marjorie, who joins the castaways in this novel. Although the television series featured three episodes with other on-screen survivors from previously lost Earth-flights, the novel's character Marjorie and the ships \"Anne\" and \"Marintha\" do not appear and are not mentioned in the series.\n\nThere were two further novels by Murray Leinster — \"The Hot Spot\" and \"Unknown Danger\" (Pyramid, 1969). The first two Leinster books were reprinted in 1969 in the United Kingdom by World Distributors, the eponymous novel retitled \"The Trap.\" Unknown Danger was not published in the UK, but World Distributors also published two United Kingdom-only novels the same year, \"Slingshot for a David\" and \"The Mean City\"; both were credited to James Bradwell, a pseudonym for Arthur William Charles Kent.\n\nA hardback novel for children, \"Flight of Fear\" by Carl Henry Rathjen (1969), was published in the United States by Whitman.\n\nAlso in 1968, Gold Key Comics published a comic book version of \"Land of the Giants\", which ran to five issues. In 2010, all five issues were reprinted together as a hardcover book by Hermes Press.\n\nIn 1968, Aurora Plastics Company produced two plastic model kits based on the series: \"Land of the Giants\" was the title of a diorama depicting a giant snake attacking characters Steve Burton, Betty Hamilton and Dan Erickson, who uses a giant safety-pin as a spear. The second kit was a model of the \"Spindrift\", released as \"Land of the Giants Space Ship\", instead of using the proper name for the vehicle.\n\nIn 1975, Aurora re-issued the kit (now renamed \"Rocket Transport Spindrift\"), with new box art and photos of the assembled kit. It had a front top section which could be lifted off, revealing a full interior that had to be constructed by the builder, as well as a working door. Most of the model kit was molded in the same bright red-orange as the ship itself, while the interior was molded in a light green which could be painted.\n\nDeanna Lund (Valerie Scott) co-wrote a series of short stories based on the series, under the collective title \"Valerie in Giant Land\".\n\nMeTV began airing \"Land Of The Giants\" in September 2016 to complement its Saturday night Sci-Fi line-up of other Irwin Allen series: \"Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea\", \"Lost In Space\" and \"The Time Tunnel\". Prior to debuting on MeTV, \"Land Of The Giants\" had aired only sporadically in syndication in recent years. The Horror Channel in the UK aired the series in full from September 19, 2016, showing one episode a day on weekdays, across ten weeks.\n\n"}

{"id": "3182559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3182559", "title": "Marriage A-la-Mode (Hogarth)", "text": "Marriage A-la-Mode (Hogarth)\n\nMarriage A-la-Mode is a series of six pictures painted by William Hogarth between 1743 and 1745 depicting a pointed skewering of upper class 18th century society. This moralistic warning shows the disastrous results of an ill-considered marriage for money and satirises patronage and aesthetics. The pictures are exhibited in the National Gallery, London.\n\nThis series of paintings were not received as well as his other moral tales, \"A Harlot's Progress\" (1732) and \"A Rake's Progress\" (1735), and when they were finally sold in 1751, it would be for a much lower sum than the artist had hoped for.\n\nIn \"Marriage A-la-Mode,\" Hogarth challenges the traditional view that the rich live virtuous lives with a heavy satire on the notion of arranged marriages. In each piece, he shows the young couple and their family and acquaintances at their worst: engaging in affairs, drinking, gambling, and numerous other vices. This is regarded by many as his finest project, certainly the best example of his serially-planned story cycles.\n\n\nThese pictures were at first poorly received by the public, to the great disappointment of the artist. He sold them to a Mr. Lane of Hillington for one hundred and twenty guineas. The frames alone had cost Hogarth four guineas each, so his initial remuneration for painting this valuable series was only sixteen shillings over a hundred pounds. From Mr. Lane's estate, they became the property of his nephew, Colonel Cawthorn. In May 1796 they were sold by auction at Christie's, Pall Mall, for the sum of one thousand guineas; the purchaser was John Julius Angerstein. They are now owned by the British government and are part of the collection of the National Gallery.\n\nIt had been Hogarth's intention to follow the \"Marriage A-la-Mode\" series with a companion series called \"The Happy Marriage\", however, this series was never completed and only exists as a series of unfinished sketches. \n\nAlthough this series of paintings are works of art in their own right, their original purpose was to provide the subjects for the series of engraved copper plate prints. By the nature of the process, when engraving copper plates, the image engraved on the plate by the engraver is reversed, that is to say, a mirror image of the final print. Normally, when undertaking paintings that are to be engraved, the painting is produced the \"right way round\" — not reversed – and then the engraver views it in a mirror as he undertakes the engraving. Hogarth was an engraver himself and disliked this course of action using mirrors, so unusually, he produced the paintings for Marriage à-la-mode already reversed so the engraver could directly copy them.\n\nIt would normally be expected to view the series of prints moving from left to right and Hogarth would have taken this into account when composing the original paintings.\n\nCommentators have used a variety of names for the individual paintings, but as the paintings are presently in the National Gallery the names used there are used here.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "76592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76592", "title": "Mermaid", "text": "Mermaid\n\nIn folklore, a mermaid is an aquatic creature with the head and upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks, and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.\n\nThe male equivalent of the mermaid is the merman, also a familiar figure in folklore and heraldry. Although traditions about and sightings of mermen are less common than those of mermaids, they are generally assumed to co-exist with their female counterparts.\n\nSome of the attributes of mermaids may have been influenced by the Sirens of Greek mythology. Historical accounts of mermaids, such as those reported by Christopher Columbus during his exploration of the Caribbean, may have been inspired by manatees and similar aquatic mammals. While there is no evidence that mermaids exist outside folklore, reports of mermaid sightings continue to the present day, including 21st century examples from Israel and Zimbabwe.\n\nMermaids have been a popular subject of art and literature in recent centuries, such as in Hans Christian Andersen's well-known fairy tale \"The Little Mermaid\" (1836). They have subsequently been depicted in operas, paintings, books, films and comics.\n\nThe word \"mermaid\" is a compound of the Old English \"mere\" (sea), and \"maid\" (a girl or young woman). The equivalent term in Old English was \"merewif\". They are conventionally depicted as beautiful with long flowing hair. As cited above, they are sometimes equated with the sirens of Greek mythology (especially the \"Odyssey\"), half-bird femmes fatales whose enchanting voices would lure soon-to-be-shipwrecked sailors to nearby rocks, sandbars or shoals.\n\nSirenia is an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, including manatees and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) in the form of two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.\n\nSirenomelia, also called \"mermaid syndrome\", is a rare congenital disorder in which a child is born with his or her legs fused together and small genitalia. This condition is about as rare as conjoined twins, affecting one out of every 100,000 live births and is usually fatal within a day or two of birth because of kidney and bladder complications. Four survivors were known as of July 2003.\n\nAs the anthropologist A. Asbjørn Jøn noted: \"these 'marine beasts' have featured in folk tradition for many centuries now, and until relatively recently they have maintained a reasonably standard set of characteristics. Many folklorists and mythographers deem that the origin of the mythic mermaid is the dugong, posing a theory that mythicised tales have been constructed around early sightings of dugongs by sailors.\" \n\nDepictions of entities with the tails of fish, but upper bodies of human beings appear in Mesopotamian artwork from the Old Babylonian Period onwards. These figures are usually mermen, but mermaids do occasionally appear. The name for the mermaid figure may have been \"kuliltu\", meaning \"fish-woman\". Such figures were used in Neo-Assyrian art as protective figures and were shown in both monumental sculpture and in small, protective figurines.\n\nThe first known mermaid stories appeared in Assyria c. 1000 BC. The goddess Atargatis, mother of Assyrian queen Semiramis, loved a mortal (a shepherd) and unintentionally killed him. Ashamed, she jumped into a lake and took the form of a fish, but the waters would not conceal her divine beauty. Thereafter, she took the form of a mermaid — human above the waist, fish below — although the earliest representations of Atargatis showed her as a fish with a human head and arm, similar to the Babylonian god Ea. The Greeks recognized Atargatis under the name Derketo. Sometime before 546 BC, Milesian philosopher Anaximander postulated that mankind had sprung from an aquatic animal species. He thought that humans, who begin life with prolonged infancy, could not have survived otherwise.\n\nA popular Greek legend turned Alexander the Great's sister, Thessalonike, into a mermaid after her death, living in the Aegean. She would ask the sailors on any ship she would encounter only one question: \"Is King Alexander alive?\" (;\"), to which the correct answer was: \"He lives and reigns and conquers the world\" (Greek: \"Ζει και βασιλεύει και τον κόσμον κυριεύει\"). This answer would please her, and she would accordingly calm the waters and bid the ship farewell. Any other answer would enrage her, and she would stir up a terrible storm, dooming the ship and every sailor on board.\n\nIn the second century AD, the Hellenized Syrian writer Lucian of Samosata wrote about the Syrian temples he had visited in his treatise \"On the Syrian Goddess\", which was originally written in Ionic Greek:\n\nIn his \"Natural History\" 9.4.9-11, Pliny the Elder describes numerous sightings of mermaids off the coast of Gaul, noting that their bodies were covered all over in scales and that their corpses frequently washed up on shore. He comments that the governor of Gaul even wrote a letter to Emperor Augustus to inform him.\n\nThe \"One Thousand and One Nights\" collection includes several tales featuring \"sea people\", such as \"Djullanar the Sea-girl\". Unlike depictions of mermaids in other mythologies, these are anatomically identical to land-bound humans, differing only in their ability to breathe and live underwater. They can (and do) interbreed with land humans, and the children of such unions have the ability to live underwater. In the tale \"Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman\", the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land. The underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. In \"The Adventures of Bulukiya\", the protagonist Bulukiya's quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, where he encounters societies of mermaids.\n\nDue to their vaguely anthropomorphic shape, dried skates have long been described as mermaids. Often their appearance is deliberately modified to make them look even more human. In Europe, dried skates, sometimes called \"devil fish,\" (not to be confused with devil fish or devil rays, two species of ray native to the north Atlantic) were displayed as mermaids, angels, demons, or basilisks. In Britain they are known as \"Jenny Hanivers\", perhaps in reference to Antwerp, where they were made by sailors. Dried skates are also known in Mexico, where they are believed to have magical powers, and are used in healing rituals.\n\nThe Norman chapel in Durham Castle, built around 1078 by Saxon stonemasons, has what is probably the earliest surviving artistic depiction of a mermaid in England. It can be seen on a south-facing capital above one of the original Norman stone pillars.\n\nMermaids appear in British folklore as unlucky omens, both foretelling disaster and provoking it. Several variants of the ballad \"Sir Patrick Spens\" depict a mermaid speaking to the doomed ships. In some versions, she tells them they will never see land again; in others, she claims they are near shore, which they are wise enough to know means the same thing. Mermaids can also be a sign of approaching rough weather, and some have been described as monstrous in size, up to .\n\nMermaids have also been described as able to swim up rivers to freshwater lakes. In one story, the Laird of Lorntie went to aid a woman he thought was drowning in a lake near his house; a servant of his pulled him back, warning that it was a mermaid, and the mermaid screamed at them that she would have killed him if it were not for his servant. But mermaids could occasionally be more beneficent; e.g., teaching humans cures for certain diseases. Mermen have been described as wilder and uglier than mermaids, with little interest in humans.\n\nAccording to legend, a mermaid came to the Cornish village of Zennor where she used to listen to the singing of a chorister, Matthew Trewhella. The two fell in love, and Matthew went with the mermaid to her home at Pendour Cove. On summer nights, the lovers can be heard singing together. At the Church of Saint Senara in Zennor, there is a famous chair decorated by a mermaid carving which is probably six hundred years old.\n\nSome tales raised the question of whether mermaids had immortal souls, answering in the negative. The figure of Lí Ban appears as a sanctified mermaid, but she was a human being transformed into a mermaid. After three centuries, when Christianity had come to Ireland, she was baptized. The Irish mermaid is called merrow in tales such as \"Lady of Gollerus\" published in the 19th century. In Scottish mythology, a \"ceasg\" is a fresh-water mermaid, though little beside the term has been preserved in folklore.\n\nMermaids from the Isle of Man, known as \"ben-varrey\", are considered more favorable toward humans than those of other regions, with various accounts of assistance, gifts and rewards. One story tells of a fisherman who carried a stranded mermaid back into the sea and was rewarded with the location of treasure. Another recounts the tale of a baby mermaid who stole a doll from a human little girl, but was rebuked by her mother and sent back to the girl with a gift of a pearl necklace to atone for the theft. A third story tells of a fishing family that made regular gifts of apples to a mermaid and was rewarded with prosperity.\n\nA freshwater mermaid-like creature from European folklore is Melusine. She is sometimes depicted with two fish tails, or with the lower body of a serpent.\n\nThe best-known example of mermaids in literature is probably Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, \"The Little Mermaid\", first published in 1837. In the original story, a young mermaid falls in love with a human prince whom she saves from drowning when his ship is wrecked in a storm. Although her grandmother tells her not to envy humans, who live much shorter lives than mermaids, and whose only consolation is an immortal soul, the mermaid chooses to risk her life in order to be with the prince. She trades her tongue and her beautiful voice to the sea-witch in exchange for a draught that will make her human and allow her to live on land. She will have to rely on her beauty and charm to win the prince's love, as she will be entirely mute.\nThe sea-witch warns the mermaid that, although she will be graceful, each step will feel as though she is stepping on knives; and that if she does not earn the prince's love, she will die of a broken heart after he weds another. The spell is worked, and the mermaid is found by the prince, who sees the resemblance between her and the one who rescued him from drowning, although he does not realize that they are the same person. Although the prince cares deeply for the mermaid, he is betrothed to the daughter of a neighboring king, and the mermaid cannot prevent their marriage.\n\nThe mermaid's sisters trade their beautiful hair to the sea-witch for a knife that the mermaid can use to break the spell and return to the sea. She must kill the prince before dawn on the day after his wedding. But the mermaid still loves the prince and cannot harm him. She flings the knife into the sea and jumps in after it, then begins to dissolve into foam. Then she is transformed into one of the daughters of the air, ethereal beings who strive to earn an immortal soul by doing good deeds in the world of men.\n\nA world-famous statue of the Little Mermaid, based on Andersen's fairy tale, has been in Copenhagen, Denmark since August 1913, with copies in 13 other locations around the world – almost half of them in North America.\n\nIn 1989, Walt Disney Studios released a full-length animated film based on the Andersen fairy tale. Featuring an Academy Award-winning soundtrack with songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, the film garnered glowing reviews, and was credited with revitalizing both the studio and the concept of animated feature films. Notable changes to the plot of Andersen's story include the elimination of the grandmother character and the religious aspects of the fairy tale, including the mermaid's quest to obtain an immortal soul. The sea-witch herself replaces the princess to whom the prince becomes engaged, using the mermaid's voice to prevent her from obtaining the prince's love. However, on their wedding day the plot is revealed, and the sea-witch is vanquished. The knife motif is not used in the film, which ends with the mermaid and the prince marrying. Among other things, the film was praised for portraying the mermaid as an independent and even rebellious young woman, rather than a passive actor content to let others determine her destiny.\n\nRusalkas are the Slavic counterpart of the Greek sirens and naiads. The nature of rusalkas varies among folk traditions, but according to ethnologist D.K. Zelenin they all share a common element: they are the restless spirits of the unclean dead. They are usually the ghosts of young women who died a violent or untimely death, perhaps by murder or suicide, before their wedding and especially by drowning. Rusalkas are said to inhabit lakes and rivers. They appear as beautiful young women with long pale green hair and pale skin, suggesting a connection with floating weeds and days spent underwater in faint sunlight. They can be seen after dark, dancing together under the moon and calling out to young men by name, luring them to the water and drowning them. The characterization of rusalkas as both desirable and treacherous is prevalent in southern Russia, the Ukraine and Belarus, and was emphasized by 19th-century Russian authors. The best-known of the great Czech nationalist composer Antonín Dvořák's operas is \"Rusalka\".\n\nIn \"Sadko\" (), an East Slavic epic, the title character—an adventurer, merchant, and \"gusli\" musician from Novgorod—lives for some time in the underwater court of the \"Sea Tsar\" and marries his daughter, Chernava, before finally returning home. The tale inspired such works as the poem \"Sadko\" by Alexei Tolstoy (1817–75), the opera \"Sadko\" composed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and the painting by Ilya Repin.\n\nMermaids are included in the \"Shanhaijing\" (\"Classic of Mountains and Seas\") compilation of Chinese geography and mythology, dating from the 4th century BC. A 15th-century compilation of quotations from Chinese literature tells of a mermaid who \"wept tears which became pearls\". An early 19th-century book entitled \"Jottings on the South of China\" contains two stories about mermaids. In the first, a man captures a mermaid on the shore of Namtao island. She looks human in every respect except that her body is covered with fine hair of many colors. She can't talk, but he takes her home and marries her. After his death, the mermaid returns to the sea where she was found. In the second story, a man sees a woman lying on the beach while his ship was anchored offshore. On closer inspection, her feet and hands appear to be webbed. She is carried to the water, and expresses her gratitude toward the sailors before swimming away.\n\nSuvannamaccha (lit. golden mermaid) is a daughter of Ravana that appears in the Cambodian and Thai versions of the Ramayana. She is a mermaid princess who tries to spoil Hanuman's plans to build a bridge to Lanka but falls in love with him instead. She is a popular figure of Thai folklore.\n\nMami Water (Lit. \"Mother of the Water\") are water spirits venerated in west, central and southern Africa, and in the African diaspora in the Caribbean and parts of North and South America. They are usually female, but are sometimes male. They are regarded as diabolical beings, and are often femme fatale, luring men to their deaths. The Persian word \"برایم بمان\" or \"maneli\" means \"mermaid\".\n\nThe Neo-Taíno nations of the Caribbean identify a mermaid called \"Aycayia\" with attributes of the goddess Jagua and the hibiscus flower of the majagua tree \"Hibiscus tiliaceus\". In modern Caribbean culture, there is a mermaid recognized as a Haitian \"vodou\" loa called \"La Sirene\" (lit. \"the mermaid\"), representing wealth, beauty and the orisha Yemaya.\n\nExamples from other cultures are the jengu of Cameroon, the iara of Brazil and the Greek oceanids, nereids and naiads. The ningyo is a fishlike creature from Japanese folklore, and consuming its flesh bestows amazing longevity. Mermaids and mermen are also characters of Philippine folklore, where they are locally known as \"sirena\" and \"siyokoy\" respectively. The Javanese people believe that the southern beach in Java is a home of Javanese mermaid queen Nyi Roro Kidul. The myth of \"Pania of the Reef\", a well known tale of Māori mythology, has many parallels with stories of sea-people in other parts of the world.\n\nAccording to Dorothy Dinnerstein's book \"The Mermaid and the Minotaur\", human-animal hybrids such as mermaids and minotaurs convey the emergent understanding of the ancients that human beings were both one with and different from animals:\nIn 1493, sailing off the coast of Hispaniola, Christopher Columbus reported seeing three \"female forms\" which \"rose high out of the sea, but were not as beautiful as they are represented\". The logbook of Blackbeard, an English pirate, records that he instructed his crew on several voyages to steer away from charted waters which he called \"enchanted\" for fear of merfolk or mermaids, which Blackbeard himself and members of his crew reported seeing. These sightings were often recounted and shared by sailors and pirates who believed that mermaids brought bad luck and would bewitch them into giving up their gold and dragging them to the bottom of the sea. Two sightings were reported in Canada near Vancouver and Victoria, one from sometime between 1870 and 1890, the other from 1967. A Pennsylvania fisherman reported five sightings of a mermaid in the Susquehanna River near Marietta in June 1881.\n\nIn August 2009, after dozens of people reported seeing a mermaid leaping out of Haifa Bay waters and doing aerial tricks, the Israeli coastal town of Kiryat Yam offered a $1 million award for proof of its existence. In February 2012, work on two reservoirs near Gokwe and Mutare in Zimbabwe stopped when workers refused to continue, stating that mermaids had hounded them away from the sites. It was reported by Samuel Sipepa Nkomo, the water resources minister.\n\nIn May 2012, a \"\", a television docufiction aired on Animal Planet which centered on the experiences of former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists, showing a CGI recreation of amateur sound and video of a beached mermaid and discussing scientific theories involving the existence of mermaids. In July 2012 in response to public inquiries, and the possibility that some viewers may have mistaken the programme for a documentary, the National Ocean Service (a branch of NOAA) made the unusual declaration that \"no evidence of aquatic humanoids has ever been found\".\n\nA year later in May 2013, Animal Planet aired another docu-fiction titled \"Mermaids: The New Evidence\" featuring \"previously unreleased video evidence\", including what a former Iceland GeoSurvey scientist witnessed while diving off the coast of Greenland in an underwater submersible. The videos provide two different shots of what appears to be a humanoid creature approaching and touching their vehicle. NOAA once again released a statement saying \"The person identified as a NOAA scientist was an actor.\" The actor is separately identified as David Evans of Ontario, Canada.\n\nIn the middle of the 17th century, John Tradescant the elder created a wunderkammer (called Tradescant's Ark) in which he displayed, among other things, a \"mermaid's hand\". P. T. Barnum's 19th century taxidermal hoax called the Fiji mermaid has been mentioned above. Others have perpetrated similar hoaxes, which are usually papier-mâché fabrications or parts of deceased creatures, usually monkeys and fish, stitched together for the appearance of a grotesque mermaid. In the wake of the 2004 tsunami, pictures of Fiji \"mermaids\" circulated on the Internet as supposed examples of items that had washed up amid the devastation, though they were no more real than Barnum's exhibit.\n\nFamous in more recent centuries is the fairy tale \"The Little Mermaid\" (1836) by Hans Christian Andersen, whose works have been translated into over 100 languages. The mermaid (as conceived by Andersen) is similar to an Undine, a water nymph in German folklore who could only obtain an immortal soul by marrying a human being. Andersen's heroine inspired a bronze sculpture in Copenhagen harbour and influenced Western literary works such as Oscar Wilde's \"The Fisherman and His Soul\" and H.G. Wells' \"The Sea Lady\". Sue Monk Kidd wrote a book called \"The Mermaid Chair\" loosely based on the legends of Saint Senara and the mermaid of Zennor.\n\nSculptures and statues of mermaids can be found in many countries and cultures, with over 130 public art mermaid statues across the world. Countries with public art mermaid sculptures include Russia, Finland, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Denmark, Norway, England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, India, China, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Guam, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, Cayman Islands, Mexico, Saudi Arabia (Jeddah), the United States (including Hawaii and Virgin Islands) and Canada. Some of these mermaid statues have become icons of their city or country, and have become major tourist attractions in themselves. \"The Little Mermaid\" statue in Copenhagen is an icon of that city as well as of Denmark. The Havis Amanda statue symbolizes the rebirth of the city of Helsinki, capital of Finland. The Syrenka (mermaid) is part of the Coat of Arms of Warsaw, and is considered a protector of Warsaw, capital of Poland, which publicly displays statues of their mermaid.\n\nMusical depictions of mermaids include those by Felix Mendelssohn in his \"Fair Melusina\" overture and the three \"Rhine daughters\" in Richard Wagner's \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\". Lorelei, the name of a Rhine mermaid immortalized in the Heinrich Heine poem of that name, has become a synonym for a siren. \"The Weeping Mermaid\" is an orchestral piece by Taiwanese composer Fan-Long Ko.\n\nAn influential image was created by John William Waterhouse, from 1895 to 1905, entitled \"A Mermaid\". An example of late British Academy style artwork, the piece debuted to considerable acclaim (and secured Waterhouse's place as a member of the Royal Academy), but disappeared into a private collection and did not resurface until the 1970s. It is currently once again in the Royal Academy's collection. Mermaids were a favorite subject of John Reinhard Weguelin, a contemporary of Waterhouse. He painted an image of the mermaid of Zennor as well as several other depictions of mermaids in watercolour.\n\nFilm depictions include the romantic comedy \"Splash\" (1984) and \"Aquamarine\" (2006). A 1963 episode of the television series \"Route 66\" entitled \"The Cruelest Sea\" featured a mermaid performance artist working at Weeki Wachee aquatic park. Mermaids also appeared in the popular supernatural drama television series \"Charmed\", and were the basis of its spin-off series \"Mermaid\". In \"She Creature\" (2001), two carnival workers abduct a mermaid in Ireland c. 1900 and attempt to transport her to America. The film \"\" mixes old and new myths about mermaids: singing to sailors to lure them to their death, growing legs when taken onto dry land, and bestowing kisses with magical healing properties. Animated films include Disney's musical version of Andersen's tale, \"The Little Mermaid\", and Hayao Miyazaki's \"Ponyo\". The Australian teen dramedy \"\" chronicles the adventures of three modern-day mermaids along the Gold Coast of Australia.\n\nIn heraldry, the charge of a mermaid is commonly represented with a comb and a mirror, and blazoned as a \"mermaid in her vanity\". In addition to vanity, mermaids are also a symbol of eloquence.\n\nA shield and sword-wielding mermaid (\"Syrenka\") is on the official coat of arms of Warsaw. Images of a mermaid have symbolized Warsaw on its arms since the middle of the 14th century. Several legends associate Triton of Greek mythology with the city, which may have been the origin of the mermaid's association.\n\nThe Cusack family crest includes a mermaid wielding a sword, as depicted on a memorial stone for Sir Thomas Cusack (1490–1571).\nThe city of Norfolk, Virginia, also uses a mermaid as a symbol. The personal coat of arms of Michaëlle Jean, a former Governor General of Canada, features two mermaids as supporters.\n\nInterest in mermaid costuming has grown alongside the popularity of fantasy cosplay as well as the availability of inexpensive monofins used in the construction of mermaid costumes. These costumes are typically designed to be used while swimming, in an activity known as mermaiding. Mermaid fandom conventions have also been held.\n\nThe Ama are Japanese skin divers, predominantly women, who traditionally dive for shellfish and seaweed wearing only a loincloth and who have been in action for at least 2,000 years. Starting in the twentieth century, they have increasingly been regarded as a tourist attraction. They operate off reefs near the shore, and some perform for sightseers instead of diving to collect a harvest. They have been romanticized as mermaids.\n\nProfessional female divers have performed as mermaids at Florida's Weeki Wachee Springs since 1947. The state park calls itself \"The Only City of Live Mermaids\" and was extremely popular in the 1960s, drawing almost one million tourists per year. Most of the current performers work part-time while attending college, and all are certified Scuba divers. They wear fabric tails and perform aquatic ballet (while holding their breath) for an audience in an underwater stage with glass walls. Children often ask if the \"mermaids\" are real. The park's PR director says \"Just like with Santa Claus or any other mythical character, we always say yes. We're not going to tell them they're not real\".\n\n"}
{"id": "43573181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43573181", "title": "Mirror's Edge Catalyst", "text": "Mirror's Edge Catalyst\n\nMirror's Edge Catalyst is a first-person action-adventure platformer video game developed by EA DICE and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016. Its plot focuses on protagonist Faith Connors' origins.\n\n\"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics upon release, with most reviewers praising the free-running gameplay and visuals, but criticizing the story and combat.\n\n\"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\" is a first-person action-adventure game in which the player takes control of Faith Connors as she progresses through a futuristic city named Glass. Similar to the original \"Mirror's Edge\", players traverse the city using aspects of urban exploration and parkour movements to complete missions and evade or fight enemies. Players can also make use of environmental objects such as zip-lines and ledges, and equipment; this includes a MAG (Manifold Attachment Gear) Rope and a Disruptor to travel across buildings, disable certain systems (such as large fans or security cameras) and aid Faith during combat. When players mark an objective on their map, Faith's \"runner vision\" is activated and some scenery items automatically highlight in red. These act as guides to lead players towards their objective. The use of levels and linear gameplay found in the first \"Mirror's Edge\" has been replaced with an open world, free-roaming environment. This gives players more freedom in traversal, allowing for the use of multiple paths to reach one's objective. In addition to the campaign's mission, side activities such as time trials, races and environmental puzzles are featured. Additionally, items called GridLeaks can be found across the world that can be collected by players.\n\nCombat mechanics of the game received an overhaul and a new combat system was developed as traversal is greatly emphasized in the game. Also, though only used sparingly in the previous game, \"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\" has removed the use of guns by the player altogether, focusing on Faith's running and parkour movements and quick melee-style attacks to take down or evade her enemies. Faith enters focus mode while she is running. With sufficient focus Faith can evade bullets from enemies. According to Sara Jansson, the senior producer of the game, the combat and fighting featured is an extension to the game's movement instead of a separated set. When Faith is performing a finishing move, the game switches to a third-person perspective.\n\n\"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\" contains several multiplayer features, which DICE calls Social Play. While there are no live co-operative multiplayer or side-by-side competitive modes, the game features asynchronous multiplayer in which a player's actions in the game can affect the world for other players' games. Among these are Time Trials which, unlike in the 2008 game, are not pre-defined by DICE. Instead, these checkpoint-to-checkpoint paths are set by any player whereby others can race against them at their leisure for faster times. Players are also able to place Beat Location Emitters for other players to track down, an exploration activity similar to geocaching.\n\nThe game takes place in the dystopian, futuristic city of Glass, the showcase city of the nation of Cascadia, governed by a totalitarian corporatocracy. Cascadian society is highly stratified, and the majority of citizens work for the corporations and are connected to the Grid, a massive social monitoring network digitally connecting everything and everyone in cities like Glass. The corporations are secretly preparing to launch a project, called Reflection, to control the populace through the Grid.\n\nSo-called Runners, freelance messengers skilled at free running, refuse to be connected to the Grid and live on rooftops, making their living from covert delivery jobs while evading corporate security. The game centers around a Runner named Faith, and her efforts to help other Runners overthrow the corporate government and stop Reflection.\n\nFaith Connors is released from prison and meets up with fellow runner Icarus, as well as Runner cabal leader Noah, who raised Faith after the death of her parents. During a data grab inside the headquarters of Elysium, Faith diverges from her orders and also retrieves a valuable hard drive, but is seen by Gabriel Kruger, CEO of Kruger Security. She manages to escape, intending to use the drive's contents to pay off her debt to Dogen, a black market boss. Noah is angry at Faith for involving herself with Kruger, but tells her that she needs to know what is inside the drive in order to bargain with it. Faith takes the drive to Plastic, a talented hacker, who tells her the drive contains blueprints for a top-secret project known as \"Reflection\".\nMeanwhile, K-Sec cracks down hard on the Runners because of Faith's actions at Elysium. While Icarus and Faith are away, they lead a raid on the Runners' lair and capture or kill everyone present. Faith and Icarus, believing Noah to be dead upon returning and having nowhere to go, turn to Rebecca Thane, leader of Black November, a militant resistance movement bent on destroying the Conglomerate by force. Black November rebels, assisted by the Runner duo, sets up an ambush to capture a high-ranking K-Sec commander, whom they intend to trade for their own captured soldiers. The mission is a success and it turns out that the captured officer is Isabel Kruger, daughter and personal bodyguard of Gabriel Kruger.\nFaith asks Plastic to infiltrate K-Sec servers and gather information about Isabel, who turns out to be Caitlyn \"Cat\" Connors, Faith's own sister, who was assumed dead during the November riots. Gabriel Kruger took her in as his adoptive daughter, telling her that Faith, along with the rest of her family, was killed. Armed with this realization, Faith races back to the subterranean Black November HQ, where Thane is preparing to execute Isabel/Cat in order to send Kruger a message. Faith defends Isabel, who does not seem to remember who Faith is, and begs Thane to take Isabel above ground because the air underground has been suffocating her. Thane agrees after Faith promises her the hard drive that she stole from Kruger.\nIsabel lets on to Faith that Noah might still be alive, held in a compound called Kingdom. Icarus asks to come along to save Noah, but Faith insists that he stays to look after Isabel for her because she does not trust Thane. Upon reaching Kingdom, Faith rescues a group of Reflection scientists who were detained by K-Sec for \"asking too many questions.\" The lead scientist, Aline Maera, explains that Reflection involves injecting the population with nanites that can be remote-controlled through a broadcast signal as a way to regulate thoughts and emotions, thereby making people \"become the Grid\" and allowing corporations absolute control over citizens. Aline also mentions that Faith's own mother Erika invented an algorithm that would later allow Reflection to be realized.\n\nThrough cutscenes interspersed between the campaign missions, it is revealed that Gabriel Kruger led a K-Sec task force sent to neutralize the Connors after they realized the grave implications of Reflection and wanted out. Kruger killed the Connors, then tried to capture Faith and Cat who were hiding nearby. As the girls were escaping, a gas grenade was tossed, causing Cat to choke and lose consciousness. Faith was forced to abandon her.\n\nFaith finds Noah, who is being experimented on with prototype Reflection nanites, but is too late to prevent his death. Meanwhile, back at Black November HQ, the rebels are ambushed by K-Sec while bringing Isabel up. Icarus and the rebels are injected with Reflection nanites.\nThe Runners and their allies regroup at Plastic's hideout, which is shielded from Reflection broadcast signals. Plastic and Aline work together to engineer a virus to disable Reflection once and for all. In order to do this, Faith needs to secure Gabriel Kruger's own gridPrint, which she successfully does by breaking into his private apartment. From there, she witnesses a massive explosion at The Shard, the tallest building in all of Glass (presumably courtesy of Black November). Faith still needs to go on top of The Shard, which contains the broadcast antenna and is now unstable, to activate the virus. She is confronted by Kruger at the top of the building, who attempts to stop her. He defends his decision to launch Reflection by saying the nanites are a cure designed to keep Isabel's chronic lung condition at bay, and that the project is about survival rather than control.\nFaith subdues Kruger and his bodyguards, just as she sees Isabel at the door, who attempts to stop the virus but is too late; it finishes wiping Reflection out, thus making Isabel's lung condition return. She then runs away to the helipad, with Faith giving chase. They fight, as Isabel accuses Faith of abandoning her behind to die in the vent after not being able to wake her up (which probably contributed to Isabel's lung condition), while Faith attempts to remind Isabel of who she really is. Gabriel Kruger appears on a helicopter and begs Isabel to come with him, but she hesitates after Faith tells her that she saw Kruger kill their biological parents. Running out of patience, he orders his guards to shoot Faith, but Isabel protects her. The Shard starts to crumble, sending Kruger's helicopter tumbling away; Kruger falls out and Faith slides towards the edge of the helipad.\nBarely hanging on, Faith almost falls to her death until Isabel catches her at the last moment. Kruger is heard calling out for his \"daughter\" to save him. Faith pleads with Isabel not to do so, to no avail, as Isabel explains that she \"has to\" and runs off in Kruger's direction. However, as the helicopter rises again and flies away, only Isabel is standing in it, with Kruger nowhere to be seen.\nIn the aftermath, it is reported on the news that Isabel will now supersede her \"missing\" father as Kruger Security CEO. While there was no uprising in the population, Faith has successfully disabled the Reflection launch, thus keeping people safe from Conglomerate control.\n\nThe new \"Mirror's Edge\" game was officially revealed in June 2013 at the Electronic Arts press event at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in North America on June 7, 2016, and in Europe on June 9. The game was announced soon after as a prequel to \"Mirror's Edge\" showcasing the origins of Faith, and uses the Frostbite engine, instead of the Unreal Engine used in the first game. However, at a later date Sara Jansson stated that the game was not been seen as either a reboot or a prequel. Electronic Arts also confirmed in 2013 that the game would be an \"open-world action adventure\". According to DICE's general manager Karl Magnus Troedsson, the game focuses on the first-person combat mechanics building upon the first-person movement mechanics that were present in the first game. As the game features a free-roaming environment, the runner vision from the first game had been completely redesigned to adapt this structure. The runner vision in \"Catalyst\" can recalculate the path for players towards their objectives or waypoints.\n\nThe game was featured at E3 for a second time in June 2014, and prototype gameplay was briefly shown. \"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\" has more varied gameplay for Faith and Runners, where they serve a greater purpose than in the first game. In January 2014, writer Rhianna Pratchett announced on Twitter that she would not be involved with the new game and neither would most of the original team. \"Mirror's Edge\" was confirmed to have a planned release date of February 23, 2016 before it was delayed.\n\nThe title \"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\" was formally announced in June 2015 prior to E3 2015; DICE product manager Sara Jansson affirmed that the game is not a sequel but would delve into more of Faith's past while expanding on the original game's first-person perspective experience. On June 15, at E3, and later on the \"Mirror's Edge\" YouTube channel, DICE released a new trailer for \"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\", revealing elements of the game's storyline and environment. It was confirmed that the game would feature an open-world design and Faith would no longer be able to use guns.\n\nOn September 30, 2015, it was announced that the soundtrack composer for the original \"Mirror's Edge\", Solar Fields would again compose for \"Catalyst\". He collaborated with Scottish synthpop band Chvrches to create an original song for the game's soundtrack entitled \"Warning Call\".\n\nOn October 29, 2015, it was announced that the game had been delayed until May 24, 2016 to allow additional development time and for DICE to refine the traversal gameplay. On April 21, 2016, it was announced that the game had been delayed until June 7, 2016 to allow optimization and perfection of Social Play. The game's Collector Edition was released alongside the main game. It included a figurine of Faith, a steel book, a lithograph, temporary tattoos, and a storage box.\n\nA prequel comic book called \"Mirror's Edge: Exordium\", leading towards the storyline of \"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\", was published on September 9, 2015 by Dark Horse Comics.\n\nThe game was the second best-selling retail game in the UK in its first week of release, only behind \"Overwatch\". In its second week of release, the game became the sixth best-selling retail game of the week. Based on EA's comments and financial releases, sales analyst Michael Pachter estimated that the game sold between 1.7 and 2 million copies by the start of August.\n\nAccording to review aggregation website Metacritic, \"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics. Chris Carter from \"Destructoid\" gave the game a positive review, commending the focus on open world gameplay, saying that the game \"nails\" exploration and parkour movement. He felt that because the gameplay was fun overall, players could spend an endless amount of time roaming the game world. Carter also called the overall visuals \"beautiful\" and felt that the design of the environments help create a world that is full of life. Carter disliked the story, however, for being predictable and featuring unlikeable supporting characters but said it was forgivable because players are able to ignore it and focus on the gameplay aspects.\n\nWhile citing the movement system as a positive and the combat mechanics as a negative, Spencer Campbell concluded his review for \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" with: \"\"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\" has a strong core built by its movement system, but when it comes time to do anything else than run from point A to point B, you'll probably be more inclined to run away.\"\n\n\"Game Informer\"s Ben Reeves summarized his review with: \"The original \"Mirror's Edge\" is an overlooked gem from last generation, but even diehard fans will have trouble finding the diamonds in this rough.\" Reeves disliked the design of the game's environments, calling them \"barren\" and \"lifeless\", criticized the melee combat for feeling like a chore, stated that the soundtrack lacked defining characteristics, called the main story \"rushed\", and felt that the side-content was \"boring\".\n\nGame Revolution's Peter Paras called the game's environments \"gorgeous\" and \"unique\", commended the large amount of content, and praised the visuals of the cutscenes. Paras thought that the gameplay was \"unintuitive\" and \"clunky\", however, and hated the story and characters. Paras also experienced some technical issues, thought that character animations were \"poor\", and said that the design of the menus was \"strange\".\n\nScott Butterworth of GameSpot gave particular praise to the movement mechanics, saying that they consistently wowed him throughout the entire game and made up for the various shortcomings he experienced. Butterworth also liked the varied mix of side-content and called the open world exploration \"rewarding\". Butterworth's main criticisms were concerning the \"mediocre\" story and the \"clunky\" combat.\n\nGamesRadar's Leon Hurley stated: \"\"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\" is an interesting game with some strong ideas but not enough variety.\" Hurley praised the visuals but called the combat \"terrible\". Ryan McCaffrey for IGN summarized his review with: \"\"Mirror's Edge\"s return shines in some regards, but is ultimately a disappointment.\" McCaffrey complimented the user-generated content and parkour gameplay but criticized the story and characters, as well as the \"uneven\" combat and inconsistent visuals.\n\nArthur Gies of \"Polygon\" wrote: \"I imagine most players will happily bounce from side mission to delivery to grid node and back again, content to do what \"Mirror's Edge\" has always been best at: constantly moving forward and up. And once you can focus on that, \"Mirror's Edge Catalyst\" is a flawed, but often great breath of something different and exciting in an open-world landscape full of the same old thing.\"\n"}
{"id": "21777295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21777295", "title": "Museum of Bad Art", "text": "Museum of Bad Art\n\nThe Museum Of Bad Art (MOBA) is a privately owned museum whose stated aim is \"to celebrate the labor of artists whose work would be displayed and appreciated in no other forum\". It was originally in Dedham with current branches in Somerville, Brookline, and South Weymouth in Massachusetts. Its permanent collection includes over 700 pieces of \"art too bad to be ignored\", 25 to 35 of which are on public display at any one time.\n\nMOBA was founded in 1994, after antique dealer Scott Wilson showed a painting he had recovered from the trash to some friends, who suggested starting a collection. Within a year, receptions held in Wilson's friends' home were so well-attended that the collection needed its own viewing space. The museum then moved to the basement of a theater in Dedham. Explaining the reasoning behind the museum's establishment, co-founder Jerry Reilly said in 1995: \"While every city in the world has at least one museum dedicated to the best of art, MOBA is the only museum dedicated to collecting and exhibiting the worst.\" To be included in MOBA's collection, works must be original and have serious intent, but they must also have significant flaws without being boring; curators are not interested in displaying deliberate kitsch.\n\nMOBA has been mentioned in dozens of off-the-beaten-path guides to Boston, featured in international newspapers and magazines, and has inspired several other collections throughout the world that set out to rival its own visual atrocities. Deborah Solomon of \"The New York Times Magazine\" noted that the attention the Museum Of Bad Art receives is part of a wider trend of museums displaying \"the best bad art\". The museum has been criticized for being anti-art, but the founders deny this, responding that its collection is a tribute to the sincerity of the artists who persevered with their art despite something going horribly wrong in the process. According to co-founder Marie Jackson, \"We are here to celebrate an artist's right to fail, gloriously.\"\n\nThe Museum Of Bad Art was established in 1994 by antique dealer Scott Wilson, who discovered what has become the museum's signature piece—\"Lucy in the Field with Flowers\"—protruding from between two trash cans on a Roslindale-area curb in Boston, among some garbage waiting to be collected. Wilson was initially interested only in the frame, but when he showed the picture to his friend Jerry Reilly, Reilly wanted both the frame and the painting. He exhibited \"Lucy\" in his home, and encouraged friends to look for other bad art and notify Wilson of what they found. When Wilson acquired another \"equally lovely\" piece and shared it with Reilly, they decided to start a collection. Reilly and his wife, Marie Jackson, held a party in their basement to exhibit the collection to date, and hosted a reception they facetiously titled \"The Opening of the Museum Of Bad Art\".\n\nRegular showings of the pieces collected by Wilson, Reilly, and Jackson (and those donated by others), became too much for Reilly and Jackson's small home in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, as hundreds of people attended the receptions. The founders' initial attempt at dealing with their constrained exhibition space was to create the Virtual Museum Of Bad Art, a CD-ROM with a cast of 95 people that presented the MOBA art collection in a fictional imaginary museum. This fictional MOBA allowed the visitors not only to view the paintings but to go behind the scenes in the fictional museum.\n\nWord of the museum's collection continued to spread until, according to \"Permanent Interim Acting Director\" Louise Reilly Sacco, \"it got completely out of hand\" when a group of senior citizens on a tour bus stopped to see it. In 1995 the display space was moved to the basement of the Dedham Community Theatre, a building with an aesthetic described in 2004 as \"ramshackle\". The museum in Dedham had no fixed operating hours, instead being open while the theater upstairs was open. As \"The Boston Globe\" notes, the art collection was appropriately placed \"just outside the men's room\", where sounds and smells carry to the collection and the constant flushing of the toilet \"supposedly helps maintain a uniform humidity\", according to the \"South China Morning Post\".\n\nIn MOBA's early days, the museum hosted traveling shows; on one occasion the works were hung from trees in the woods on Cape Cod for the \"Art Goes Out the Window—The Gallery in the Woods\". Bad music was played during the public viewings to complete the ambiance. In an exhibition titled \"Awash in Bad Art\", 18 pieces of art were covered in shrink wrap for \"the world's first drive-thru museum and car wash\". Marie Jackson, formerly the Director of Aesthetic Interpretation noted, \"We didn't put any watercolors in there.\" A 2001 exhibition, \"Buck Naked—Nothing But Nudes\" featured all of the MOBA nudes hung in a local spa.\n\nMOBA features its works in rotating collections. In 2003, \"Freaks of Nature\" focused on landscape artwork \"gone awry\". A 2006 exhibit titled \"Hackneyed Portraits\" was designed to \"pick up some of the slack\" when the David Hockney show at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts closed. MOBA unveiled its show \"Nature Abhors a Vacuum and All Other Housework\" in 2006; this format continues on the museum's website.\n\nA second gallery opened in 2008 at the Somerville Theatre in Davis Square, Somerville, Massachusetts, where the collection was placed near both the women's and men's restrooms. Although the original gallery was free and open to the public, the second is free with admission to the theater or with a pass requested from the museum. Exhibitions titled \"Bright Colors / Dark Emotions\" and \"Know What You Like / Paint How You Feel\" have been held in the academic gallery at Montserrat College of Art in Beverly, Massachusetts. One of MOBA's goals is \"to take bad art on the road\", according to Sacco. Pieces from MOBA's collection have been on display in museums in New York City, Ottawa, Taipei, and Virginia.\n\nIn February 2009, MOBA announced a fundraiser to assist the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, which was seriously considering whether to sell masterpieces because of the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, made worse for the university by some of its donors losing money in Bernard Madoff's investment scheme. Current MOBA curator and balloon artist/musician Michael Frank placed \"Studies in Digestion\"—a four-panel piece showing four renditions of the human digestive tract in various media by artist Deborah Grumet—on eBay for a buy-it-now price of $10,000; the first bid was $24.99. It eventually sold for $152.53 and the meager proceeds went to the Rose Art Museum, while both museums gained publicity.\n\nIn 2010, the museum opened a third location in the offices of the Brookline Interactive Group.\n\nIn December 2012, the branch at the Dedham Community Theater closed to convert the space into a screening room. Another branch has since opened at the New England Wildlife Center in South Weymouth.\n\nThe loss of two MOBA works to theft has drawn media attention and enhanced the museum's stature. In 1996, the painting \"Eileen\", by R. Angelo Le, vanished from MOBA. \"Eileen\" was acquired from the trash by Wilson, and features a rip in the canvas where someone slashed it with a knife even before the museum acquired it, \"adding an additional element of drama to an already powerful work\", according to MOBA.\n\nThe museum offered a reward of $6.50 for the return of \"Eileen\", and although MOBA donors later increased that reward to $36.73, the work remained unrecovered for many years. The Boston Police listed the crime as \"larceny, other\", and Sacco was reported saying she was unable to establish a link between the disappearance of \"Eileen\" and a notorious heist at Boston's famed Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum that occurred in 1990. In 2006–10 years after \"Eileen\" was stolen—MOBA was contacted by the purported thief demanding a $5,000 ransom for the painting; no ransom was paid, but it was returned anyway.\n\nPrompted by the theft of \"Eileen\", MOBA staff installed a fake video camera over a sign at their Dedham branch reading (in Comic Sans): \"Warning. This gallery is protected by a fake security camera\". Despite this deterrent, in 2004 Rebecca Harris' \"Self Portrait as a Drainpipe\" was removed from the wall and replaced with a ransom note demanding $10, although the thief neglected to include any contact information. Soon after its disappearance the painting was returned, with a $10 donation. Curator Michael Frank speculates that the thief had difficulty fencing the portrait because \"reputable institutions refuse to negotiate with criminals.\"\n\nAlthough the museum's motto is \"Art too bad to be ignored\", MOBA holds rigorous standards as to what they will accept. According to Marie Jackson, \"Nine out of ten pieces don't get in because they're not bad enough. What an artist considers to be bad doesn't always meet our low standards.\" As stated in the introduction to \"The Museum Of Bad Art: Masterworks\", the primary attribute of an \"objet d'art\" to be acquired by MOBA is that it must have been seriously attempted by someone making an artistic statement. A lack of artistic skill is not essential for a work to be included; a prospective painting or sculpture for the collection ideally should \"[result] in a compelling image\", or as honorary curator Ollie Hallowell stated, the art must have an \"Oh my God\" quality.\n\nAn important criterion for inclusion is that a painting or sculpture must not be boring. Michael Frank says they are not interested in commercial works like \"Dogs Playing Poker\": \"We collect things made in earnest, where people attempted to make art and something went wrong, either in the execution or in the original premise.\" Montserrat College of Art used MOBA's exhibition as a demonstration to its students that \"sincerity is still important, and pureness of intent is valid\".\n\nMOBA accepts unsolicited works if they meet its standards. Frequently, curators consider works by artists who display an intensity or emotion in the art that they are unable to reconcile with their level of skill. The museum dedicated a show to \"relentless creativity\" in an exhibition titled \"I Just Can't Stop\" that was covered by local news and CNN. Other artists are clearly technically proficient, but attempted an experiment that did not end well. Michael Frank has compared some of the works at MOBA with outsider art or art brut; some MOBA artists' works are also included in other galleries' outsider collections. Dean Nimmer, a professor at the Massachusetts College of Art (also holding the title of MOBA's Executive Director of Good Taste), noted the parallels between the Museum Of Bad Art's standards and those of other institutions: \"They take the model of a museum of fine arts and apply the same kind of criteria to acceptance for bad work ... [Their rules] are very similar to a gallery or museum that says 'Well, our area is really installation art or realist paintings or neo-post-modern abstractions.\n\nMOBA does not collect art created by children, or art traditionally perceived as lesser in quality, such as black velvet paintings, paint-by-numbers, kitsch, or factory-produced art—including works specifically created for tourists. Curators are also not interested in crafts such as latch hook rug kits. MOBA curators suggest that more appropriate venues for such works would be the \"Museum of Questionable Taste, The International Schlock Collection, or the National Treasury of Dubious Home Decoration\".\n\nThe Museum Of Bad Art has been accused of being anti-art, or taking works that were sincerely rendered and mocking them. However, Scott Wilson insists that a work of art accepted into MOBA is a celebration of the artist's enthusiasm. Marie Jackson reiterated this thought, saying \"I think it's a great encouragement to people... who want to create [and] are held back by fear, and when they see these pieces, they realize there's nothing to be afraid of—just go for it.\" Louise Reilly Sacco agreed, stating, \"If we're making fun of something, it's the art community, not the artists. But this is a real museum. It's 10 years. It's 6,000 people on a mailing list. It's recognition all over the world.\" Curators insist that artists whose works are selected by MOBA enjoy the attention and that it is a win-win; the museum gains another work of art, and the artist receives exposure in a museum. A 1997 article in \"The Chicago Tribune\" stated that none of the 10 to 15 artists who had stepped forward to acknowledge their work in MOBA had been upset.\n\nMany of the works in MOBA are donated, often by the artists themselves. Others come from yard sales or thrift stores; the Trash Collectors Union in Cambridge, Massachusetts has donated works rescued from imminent demise. Occasionally a painting may be purchased; at one time MOBA's policy was not to spend more than $6.50 on any piece. More recently, twice and even three times that amount has been paid for an exceptional work. Those pieces not retained by the museum are included in a \"Rejection Collection\" that may be sold at auction. In the past, some proceeds went to the Salvation Army for providing so many of MOBA's pieces; the museum itself usually benefits from most auctions.\n\nEach painting or sculpture MOBA exhibits is accompanied by a brief description of the medium, size, name of the artist, as well as how the piece was acquired, and an analysis of the work's possible intention or symbolism. \"Museums Journal\" noted that the discussion accompanying each work would most likely have most visitors reduced \"to hysterics\". The captions—described as \"distinctly tongue-in-cheek commentaries\" by David Mutch of the \"Christian Science Monitor\"—were primarily written by Marie Jackson, until the \"dissolution of the MOBA interpretative staff\"; the task was then taken over by Michael Frank and Louise Reilly Sacco.\n\nMany of MOBA's works generate extensive discourse from visitors. \"Lucy in the Field with Flowers\" (oil on canvas by Unknown; acquired from trash in Boston) remains a favorite with the news media and patrons. As the first work acquired by the museum, \"Lucy\" is \"a painting so powerful it commands its own preservation for posterity\", setting a standard by which all future acquisitions would be compared, and causing MOBA's founders to question if Scott Wilson found \"Lucy\" or she found him.\n\nKate Swoger of \"The Montreal Gazette\" called \"Lucy\" a \"gorgeous mistake\", describing her thus: \"an elderly woman dancing in a lush spring field, sagging breasts flopping willy-nilly, as she inexplicably seems to hold a red chair to her behind with one hand and a clutch of daisies in the other\". Author Cash Peters, using less florid language, summarized it as \"the old woman with an armchair glued to her ass\".\n\nMOBA's statement about \"Lucy\" reads: \"The motion, the chair, the sway of her breast, the subtle hues of the sky, the expression on her face—every detail combines to create this transcendent and compelling portrait, every detail cries out 'masterpiece'.\" \"The Times\" recounted comments left by a museum visitor regarding the \"endless layers of mysteries\" the image offers: \"What is Norman Mailer's head doing on an innocent grandma's body, and are those crows or F-16s skimming the hills?\"\n\n\"Lucy\" granddaughter, a Boston-area nurse named Susan Lawlor, became a fan of MOBA after seeing the portrait in a newspaper. She recognized it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890–1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted Coca-Cola from her nose in astonishment. The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: \"The face is hauntingly hers, but everything else is so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast. I'm not sure what happened to her arms and legs, and I don't know where all the flowers and yellow sky came from.\"\n\n\"Sunday on the Pot With George\" (acrylic on canvas by John Gedraitis; donated by Jim Schulman) has been deemed \"iconic\" by Bella English of \"The Boston Globe\", who assures the work is \"100 percent guaranteed to make you burst out laughing\". Wilson has pointed to \"George\" as an example of a technically well-executed piece of art using a subject not usually seen rendered in paint.\n\nMany admirers of the first work donated to MOBA are hypnotized by the image of a portly man wearing \"Y-front\" underwear while sitting on a chamber pot, in pointillist impressionism similar to the style of Georges Seurat. One critic speculates the pointillist style in \"George\" may have been acquired \"from watching too much TV\". The title refers to the Stephen Sondheim musical \"Sunday in the Park with George\", which contains a dramatic recreation of Seurat's painting \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\". Author Amy Levin suggests that \"George\" is a pastiche of Seurat's painting. The subject of this painting has been \"tentatively identified\" by the \"Annals of Improbable Research\"—the creators of the Ig Nobel award—as John Ashcroft, former United States Attorney General.\n\nA visitor was so moved by \"George\" he felt compelled to express his gratitude for its display in the Dedham Community Theatre basement, writing \"Someone had slipped into the bathroom as I took in this painting and began peeing loudly into a toilet. The reverberating sound of urine splashing while viewing \"George\" brought the painting to life, and when the denouement of the flush sounded, I wept.\" MOBA's accompanying caption introduces questions and observations: \"Can the swirling steam melt away the huge weight of George's corporate responsibilities? This pointillist piece is curious for meticulous attention to fine detail, such as the stitching around the edge of the towel, in contrast to the almost careless disregard for the subject's feet.\"\n\nIn contrast to the pointillist impressionism of \"George\", the museum also features a \"fine example of labor-intensive pointlessism\", according to MOBA staff. Mari Newman's \"Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt\" (tempera and acrylic paint on canvas; donated by the artist), inspired this description by MOBA: \"We can only wonder what possesses an artist to portray a dog juggling bones while wearing a hula skirt.\" MOBA enjoys the mystery as much as any other aspect of art, however.\n\nNewman, a professional artist from Minneapolis, responded to the curators' cogitation by describing how the image came into being. She bought used canvases while a poor art student, and was unsure how to use a canvas with these dimensions. Inspired by a cartoon of a dachshund, she chose that as a subject, but was unhappy with the effect until she added a hula skirt she had seen in a magazine, and colored dog bones she spied in a pet store. Newman wrote to them, saying \"I almost threw it out until I heard of MOBA. After many years of slashing rejected work, now I wish I had saved them all for you.\"\n\nTravel writer Cash Peters identifies six characteristics common to many of the museum's artworks. The first is that MOBA artists are unable to render hands or feet, and mask them by extending figures' arms off the canvas, hiding them with long sleeves, or placing shoes on feet in inappropriate scenarios. Second, Peters compared artists Rembrandt and J. M. W. Turner, masters of landscapes, who \"could probably paint with their eyes shut\" to MOBA artists who apparently did paint with their eyes shut, as skies are often painted in any color but blue, flora are created without reference to any existing plant organisms, and fauna appear so small in the background it is impossible to discern what kind of animals they are. Third, MOBA artists apply perspective inconsistently, either from one painting to the next, or within a single work. Peters's fourth observation concerns the difficulty MOBA artists seem to have in successfully rendering noses: he writes that a nose will be attempted so many times that the work takes on a third dimension as paint is reapplied over and over. Fifth, bad artists favor \"mixed media\": if in doubt, they glue feathers, glitter, or hair to their work. Lastly, Peters suggests that artists know their work is bad, but apparently feel the piece may be saved by including a monkey or a poodle in the composition.\n\nSince late 2008, MOBA has been experimenting with allowing the public to title and caption some works. According to the curatorial staff, since some of the works are so puzzling, mere artistic interpretation is not sufficient: they must be \"interpretated\". The \"Guest Interpretator's Collection\" is an invitation for MOBA's visitors to include their thoughts on compelling artworks; a contest decides the best analysis and these interpretations are added as each contest ends. A professor at Boston University offered his thoughts: \"The location of the museum as much as its collection suggests a commitment to the abject and a belief in the power and force of culture's marginalized effects. I was also reminded that I need to pick up some toilet bowl cleaner on my way home!\"\n\nThe Museum Of Bad Art has been mentioned in hundreds of international publications, as well as in Boston-area travel guides highlighting offbeat attractions. It has inspired similar collections or events in Australia, Ohio, and Seattle.\n\nCommedia Beauregard, a theatre company whose mission focuses on translation, was inspired by MOBA's mission to create their Master Works series of short play festivals. The company commissioned six playwrights to write short plays based on MOBA artworks. \"Master Works: The MOBA Plays\" was originally performed in January and February 2009 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The plays were based on the MOBA pieces \"Mana Lisa\", \"Invasion of the Office Zombies\", \"My Left Foot\", \"Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt\", \"Gina's Demons\", and \"Lulli, Fowl and Gravestone\". After moving to Chicago, the company again produced \"The MOBA Plays\" in March and April 2011, using three of the original plays and translating three new paintings.\n\nMuseum visitors can sign a guest book, and leave comments. One Canadian visitor wrote: \"This collection is disturbing, yet I can't seem to look away...Just like a hideous car accident.\" Another visitor warns: \"Her nipples follow you around the room. Creepy!\"\n\nResponse to MOBA's opening and continued success is, for some, evocative of the way art is treated in society. MOBA works have been described as \"unintentionally hilarious\", similar to the atrocious films of Ed Wood. Visitors—and even MOBA staff—often laugh out loud at displays. In \"Gullible's Travels\", Cash Peters contrasted this behavior with what is expected of patrons at galleries such as Southern California's Getty Museum; though viewers might find the art at the Getty equally hilarious, were they to show it they would almost certainly be thrown out.\n\nIn 2006, Louise Reilly Sacco participated in a panel discussion with authorities on art and architecture about standards of beauty and ugliness in art, published in \"Architecture Boston\". She remarked that teachers bring high school art students to MOBA, then to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA). Sacco observes, \"Somehow MOBA frees kids to laugh and point, to have their own opinions and argue about things. Then they take the experience to the MFA, where they might otherwise feel intimidated... Maybe the ugly ... frees us.\" Sacco believes that extreme ugliness is more striking than extreme beauty, and it forces people to think more deeply about what is wrong or misplaced. She connects this rigid judgment of what does not conform to beauty with intolerance for physical imperfections in people, noting that such rigidity sometimes causes parents to \"fix\" the perceived flaws in their children's faces to keep them from suffering later.\nJason Kaufman, a Harvard professor who teaches the sociology of culture, wrote that MOBA is part of a social trend he calls \"annoyism\", where mass media venues promote performances and artists who mix the deliberately bad with the clever. The Museum Of Bad Art happens to embody this trend, and further illustrates its central aim to mock the judgment system by which people identify what is bad from what is not. For Kaufman, \"The beauty of MOBA—though beauty is surely the wrong word—is the way it undermines aesthetic criteria from numerous angles.\" Amy Levin, describing how American history and culture have been shaped by small local museums, suggests that MOBA is a parody of art itself, and that MOBA's commentary, newsletter, website, and publications mock museums as authorities on what is good art. The director of the Ellipse Arts Center, a gallery in Arlington, Virginia, that hosted a traveling exhibition of MOBA works, was astonished to see people's exuberant laughter because no one visiting the Ellipse had ever responded to art this way. She observed, \"If I didn't have a sign on the door, people might not think it's so bad. Who's to say what's bad and what's good?\"\n\nDeborah Solomon, in \"The New York Times Magazine\", asserted that MOBA's success reflects a trend in modern art among artists and audiences. The arrival of abstraction and modern art in the early 20th century made art appreciation more esoteric and less accessible for the general community, showing that \"the American public ... think[s] of museums as intimidating places ruled by a cadre of experts whose taste and rituals [seem] as mysterious as those of Byzantine priests.\" Bad art is in vogue, as a movement that rejects the anti-sentimentalism that marked earlier disdain for artists such as Norman Rockwell or Gustave Moreau, according to Solomon. Garen Daly, a MOBA fan on several Boston-area art councils, stated in 1995, \"I go to a lot of openings, and sometimes they're pretty damn stuffy.\" Not only does the Museum Of Bad Art offer different fare for the eyes, but instead of the wine and cheese that is provided for most museum and art gallery visitors, a MOBA show provides its patrons with Kool-Aid, Fluffernutters and cheese puffs.\n\nThe Museum Of Bad Art has been used in academic studies as a standard of reference for the spectacularly awful. In one such study, published in \"Perspectives on Psychological Science\", researchers tested the consistency of responses between people asked to make \"gut\" judgments versus those who gave conscious well-reasoned responses regarding the quality of various pieces of art. The researchers showed respondents images from MOBA and New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), and asked them to rate each painting on a scale with two ends representing \"Very Attractive\" and \"Very Unattractive\". The study found that those who reasoned in conscious thought were neither more accurate nor as consistent in their ratings. Study participants identified and rated MoMA art higher quality, but those who used conscious reasoning did not find MoMA art more attractive than those who rated with \"gut\" judgments. Furthermore, the deliberators did not find MOBA art as unattractive as those with quicker response times. The study concluded that people who make quick judgments do so more consistently, with no significant change to accuracy.\n\nIn another study that appeared in the \"British Journal of Psychology\", researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "987013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=987013", "title": "Music of the former Netherlands Antilles", "text": "Music of the former Netherlands Antilles\n\nThe music of the former Netherlands Antilles is a mixture of native, African and European elements, and is closely connected with trends from neighboring countries such as Venezuela and Colombia and islands such as Puerto Rico, Cuba, Santo Domingo, Haiti, Martinique, Trinidad, Dominica, and Guadeloupe. The former Netherlands Antilles islands of Curaçao and Aruba are known for their typical waltzes, danzas, mazurkas and a kind of music called tumba, which is named after the conga drums that accompany it.\n\nThe remaining islands are much smaller than Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao. They are Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten and Saba. Sint Eustatius has little nightlife, with only one nightclub (the zouk Largo Height Disco) as of 1996. The inhabitants, \"Statians\", hold impromptu street dances called \"road blocks\", using booming car stereos. Saba has a number of dances at various restaurants, including a wide variety of hip hop, calypso, soca, kompa, zouk, bouyon, reggae and merengue. Sint Maarten has a well-known Carnival tradition featuring music and dance, held in mid-April and culminating in the traditional burning of King Moui-Moui, as well as a number of nightclubs and casinos featuring music; popular \"spots\" where locals go to dance include Boo Boo Jam and Lago Height, both located on the northern (French) part of Sint Maarten; the most popular recent casino band is King Bo-Bo, known as the \"King of Calypso\".\n\nMusic is very closely connected to the Aruban culture, and plays a major role in holidays, carnivals and informal celebrations. Carnival music originated in Trinidad in the late 18th century, and combines romantic themes, calypso-inspired tunes, and drums from tumba. Other Aruban celebrations that are based around music include Dera Gai, Dande, Gaita and Aguinaldo.\n\nThe island of Bonaire is known for an array of dances, including the Bari and Simadan. Imported polka, carioca, rumba, merengue, danza, joropo, jazz waltz and mazurka are also popular. The Baile di Sinta is a popular fertility dance, performed around a maypole. Traditional African work songs on Bonaire evolved over time into ritual songs with complex dances, instrumentation and polyphony.\n\nThe Bari, performed during the festival of the same name, as well as at other times, is led by a single singer who improvises lyrics commenting on local events and figures (such a singer is similar to a calypsonian). Confusingly, the Bari dance, which is performed during the Bari festival, is accompanied by a bongo-like drum called a Bari. The first part of the dance features men competing in a stylized, ritual dance for women, followed by a part where the couples dance, though they don't touch (it is similar to tumba).\n\nAfter the sorghum harvest in February through April, the Simadan festival is held to celebrate, with the wapa, a rhythmic, shuffling dance, accompanying the celebration. Simadan's traditional songs include three call-and-response forms, the Dan Simadan, Belua and Remailo. These use instruments including the bari, wiri, karko, quarta, guitar, triangle and clapping.\n\n\n\n"}

The central term in this definition is connections. It takes a relational stance in which learning takes place both in relation to others and in relation to learning resources.\n\nNetworked learning can offer educational institutions more functional efficiency, in that the curriculum can be more tightly managed centrally, or in the case of vocational learning, it can reduce costs to employers and tax payers. However, it is also argued that networked learning is too often considered within the presumption of institutionalised or educationalised learning, thereby omitting awareness of the benefits that networked learning has to informal or situated learning.\n\nNetwork and networked learning theories can be traced back into the 19th Century, when commentators were considering the social implications of networked infrastructure such as the railways and the telegraph. More recently, networked learning has its roots in the 1970s, with the likes of Ivan Illich's book, Deschooling Society, through to more recent commentary in the early 2000s, largely inspired by the Internet and social media.\n\nIn 1971, Ivan Illich envisioned 'learning webs' as a model for people to network the learning they needed:\n\nIn 1977 Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, Murray Silverstein, Max Jacobson, Ingrid Fiksdahl-King and Shlomo Angel wrote and published \"A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction\". In this seminal text, mostly referred to by architects, lists a \"Network of Learning\" as the 18th pattern, and cites Illich's earlier book as \"the most penetrating analysis and proposal for an alternative framework for education.\" Alexander \"et al.\" go on to advise builders and town planners interested in establishing learning networks with:\n\nIn the 1970s, The Institute For The Future at Menlo Park in California experimented with networked learning practices based on the Internet and computer conferencing. Soon after their reports were published two educational pioneers in the use of Internet technologies, Hiltz and Turoff, linked education directly with this pioneering work.\n\nIn the late 1980s Dr. Charles A. Findley headed the Collaborative Networked Learning project at Digital Equipment Corporation on the East Coast of the United States. Findley's project conducted trend analysis and developed prototypes of collaborative learning environments, which became the basis for their further research and development of what they called Collaborative Networked Learning (CNL), and Collaborative Learning-Work (CLW).\n\nSince the development of the Internet as a significant medium for access to information and communication, the practice of networked learning has tended to focus on its use. In the first phase of the Internet its use for networked learning was restricted by low bandwidth and the emphasis was largely on written and text based interactions between people and the text based resources they referred to. This textual form of interaction was a familiar academic medium, even though there was recognition of the unique qualities hypertext emerging in the online form.\n\nIn 1991, Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger published \"Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation\", in which they cited numerous examples of networked learning within a wide range of settings for informal learning and within communities of practice.\n\nIn the later half of the 1990s, open, interactive, situated and networked views of learning were marginalised by educational institutions as they tended to develop or deploy content and practice through proprietary learning management systems (e.g. Blackboard Inc, WebCT), and collaborative work tools such as IBM Lotus Notes/Learning Space and Quick Place), generally following concepts around \"e-learning\". These systems enabled the restriction of access and the management of students for the administrative concerns of educational institutions.\n\nSince 1998, an international Networked Learning Conference has been held biannually. The conference proceedings from all the conferences since 2002 are available via the conference web site.\n\nCSALT, a research group at Lancaster University, UK, associated with the Networked Learning Conference series and several edited collections, defined networked learning as \"learning in which information and communication technology is used to promote connections: between one learner and other learners, between learners and tutors; between a learning community and its learning resources\". This definition seems to ignore historical use of the term however, where computing was not of central importance.\n\nIn 2000, John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid released The Social Life of Information and introduced the concept of Networks of Practice (NoP's), an informal and emergent social network that supports the sharing of information between individuals clustered around a practice. Building on the work done by Jean Lave and Étienne Wenger on community of practice (CoP's), Seely Brown and Duguid argued that a network differed from a community in that the relationships among members were more informal and fluid when compared to communities. While CoP's were often localized with strong inter-personal relationships providing group cohesion, NoPs were more global with relationships that were both strong tie and weak tie relationships. \n\nSalmon (2001) wrote \"learning is built around learning communities & interaction, extending access beyond the bounds of time and space, but offering the promise of efficiency and widening access. Think of individuals as nodes on a network!\"\n\nFrom around 2004, the idea of networked learning had a popular resurgence, corresponding with the emergence of social media and concepts of open source, such as is covered in Yochai Benkler's 2006 book, \"The Wealth of Networks\".\n\nIn 2005, George Siemens published a paper in the \"International Journal for Instructional Technology and Distance Learning\", called \"Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age\" in which he argued the need for a new learning theory, one that captured the essence and represented the process of networked knowledge creation and learning. In 2011, the International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning published the first peer reviewed collection of scholarly articles on Connectivism. This special issue was edited by George Siemens (Athabasca University and Grainne Conole (Open University, UK).\n\nIn 2007, Starke-Meyerring, Duin, & Palvetzian first described Globally Networked Learning Environments (GNLE)- networked learning environments which are specifically designed to connect students from different parts of the world. GNLEs are designed to facilitate dialogue and collaboration across and within groups of students, to develop greater understanding and competencies for global work and citizenship. GNLEs take many different shapes and forms.\n\nIn 2010, E-Learning and Digital Media published a special issue on globally networked learning titled Globally networked learning environments: Re-shaping the intersections of globalization and e-learning in higher education, and in 2011, COIL launched the first ever Institute for Globally Networked Learning in the Humanities.\n\nA massive open online course (MOOC) engages networked learning methods within the typical structure of a course. The first such course so named was Connectivism and Connective Knowledge 2008, hosted by Stephen Downes and George Siemens. More like an online event, MOOCs invite open online participation around a schedule or agenda, facilitated by people with reputation or expertise in the topics, relying on successful formations of learning networks to assist people studying the topics.\n\nEarlier examples of online courses using networked learning methods:\n\nSome researchers have used networked learning methods to collaborate and support each other's research. The is supporting a small group interested in pursuing a PhD title informally. They name their practice OpenPhD or Open and Networked PhD.\n\nAcademics at the CoCo Research Centre, University of Sydney, have been carrying out an extensive analysis of examples of networked learning, in collaboration with the developers and organisers of learning networks in various parts of the world. Their work has focussed on the \"architecture\" of learning networks - aiming to identify arrangements of tasks, tools and people that contribute to successful learning networks. Some conclusions from this work have been published in \"The architecture of productive learning networks\", which also includes a chapter on the history of networked learning.\n\nSome have argued that using formal education as a setting for researching networked learning misses most if not all of the value proposition of networked learning. Instead, Fox proposes situated learning and actor-network theory as the better approach for research.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25693764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25693764", "title": "New literacies", "text": "New literacies\n\nNew literacies generally are new forms of literacy made possible by digital technology developments, although new literacies do not necessarily have to involve use of digital technologies to be recognized as such. The term \"new literacies\" itself is relatively new within the field of literacy studies (the first documented mention of it in an academic article title dates to 1993 in a text by David Buckingham). Its definition remains open, with new literacies being conceptualized in different ways by different groups of scholars.\n\nFor example, one group of scholars argues that literacy is now deictic, and see it as continually and rapidly changing as new technologies appear and new social practices for literacy emerge. (Leu, 2000). This group aims at developing a single, overarching theory to help explain new literacies (see, for example, Leu, O'Byrne, Zawilinski, McVerry, & Everett-Cacopardo, 2009; see also, below). This orientation towards new literacies is largely psycholinguistic in nature. Other groups of scholars follow a more sociocultural orientation that focuses on literacy as a social practice, which emphasizes the role of literacy with a range of socially patterned and goal-directed ways of getting things done in the world (see, for example, Gee & Hayes, 2012; Lankshear & Knobel, 2011; Kalantzis and Cope 2011).\n\nAccompanying the varying conceptualizations of new literacies, there are a range of terms used by different researchers when referring to new literacies, including \"21st century literacies\", \"internet literacies\", \"digital literacies\", \"new media literacies\", \"multiliteracies\", \"information literacy\", \"ICT literacies\", and \"computer literacy\". In the \"Handbook of New Literacies Research\", Coiro, Knobel, Lankshear, and Leu (2008) note that all these terms \"are used to refer to phenomena we would see as falling broadly under a new literacies umbrella\" (pg. 10).\n\nCommonly recognized examples of new literacies include such practices as instant messaging, blogging, maintaining a website, participating in online social networking spaces, creating and sharing music videos, podcasting and videocasting, photoshopping images and photo sharing, emailing, shopping online, digital storytelling, participating in online discussion lists, emailing and using online chat, conducting and collating online searches, reading, writing and commenting on fan fiction, collaborating on and writing encyclopedic wikis, processing and evaluating online information, creating and sharing digital mashups, etc. (see: Black, 2008; Coiro, 2003; Gee, 2007; Hunter, 2014; Jenkins, 2006; Kist, 2007; Lankshear & Knobel, 2006; Lessig, 2005; Leu, et al. 2004; Prensky, 2006).\n\nThe field of new literacies is characterized by two theoretically distinct approaches that overlap to some extent. One is informed by cognitive and language processing theories such as cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, schema theory, metacognition, constructivism, and other similar theories. This orientation includes a particular focus on examining the cognitive and social processes involved in comprehending online or digital texts (see for example: Leu, 2001; Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, & Cammack, 2004; Coiro, 2003; Coiro & Dobler, 2007). Donald Leu, a prominent researcher in the field of new literacies, has outlined four defining characteristics of new literacies, according to a largely psycholinguistic orientation (see: Leu et al., 2007). First, new technologies (such as the internet) and the novel literacy tasks that pertain to these new technologies require new skills and strategies to effectively use them. Second, new literacies are a critical component of full participation—civic, economic, and personal—in our increasingly global society. A third component to this approach is new literacies are \"deictic\"—that is, they change regularly as new technology emerges and older technologies fade away. With this in mind, \"what may be important in reading instruction and literacy education is not to teach any single set of new literacies, but rather to teach students how to learn continuously new literacies that will appear during their lifetime.\" Finally, new literacies are \"multiple, multimodal, and multifaceted,\" and as such, multiple points of view will be most beneficial in attempting to comprehensively analyze them. This orientation makes a distinction between \"New Literacies\" and \"new literacies\" theories. Lower case theories are better able to keep up with the rapidly changing nature of literacy in a deictic world since they are closer to the specific types of changes that are taking place and interest those who study them within a particular heuristic. Lower case theories also permit the field to maximize the lenses that are used and the technologies and contexts that are studied. This position argues that every scholar who studies new literacy issues is generating important insights for everyone else, even if they do not share a particular lens, technology, or context; and that this requires a second level of theorising. New Literacies (capitalized), it is argued, is a broader, more inclusive concept, and includes common findings emerging across multiple, lower case theories. New Literacies theory benefits from work taking place in the multiple, lower case dimensions of new literacies by looking for what appear to be the most common and consistent patterns being found in lower case theories and lines of research. This approach permits everyone to fully explore their unique, lowercase perspective of new literacies, allowing scholars to maintain close focus on many different aspects of the rapidly shifting landscape of literacy during a period of rapid change. At the same time, each also benefits from expanding their understanding of other, lowercase, new literacies perspectives. By assuming change in the model, everyone is open to a continuously changing definition of literacy, based on the most recent data that emerges consistently, across multiple perspectives, disciplines, and research traditions. Moreover, areas in which alternative findings emerge are identified, enabling each to be studied again, from multiple perspectives. From this process, common patterns emerge and are included in a broader, common, New Literacies theory. From this orientation, proponents argue, this process enables a particular theorization of New Literacies to keep up with consistent elements that will always define literacy on the Internet while it also informs each of the lower case theories of new literacies with patterns that are being regularly found by others.\n\nThe second approach to studying new literacies is overtly grounded in a focus on social practices. According to Colin Lankshear and Michele Knobel from this \"social practice\" perspectives, \"new literacies\" can refer to \"new socially recognized ways of generating, communicating and negotiating meaningful content through the medium of encoded texts within contexts of participation in Discourses (or, as members of Discourses) \". From this perspective \"new\" refers to the presence of two dominant features of contemporary literacy practices. The first is the use of digital technologies as the means of producing, sharing, accessing and interacting with meaningful content. New literacies typically involve screens and pixels rather than paper and type, and digital code (that renders texts as image, sound, conventional text, and any combination of these within a single process) rather than material print. The second defining feature of new literacies is their highly collaborative, distributed, and participatory nature, as expressions of what Henry Jenkins calls engagement in participatory culture, and Lankshear and Knobel refer to as a distinctive \"ethos\".\n\nResearch within the field of new literacies is also diverse. A wide range of topics and issues are focused upon, and a broad range of methodologies are used.\n\nOne aspect of new literacies that has attracted researchers' attention is school-age children's online research and comprehension. Specifically, researchers are interested in finding the answers to questions such as how reading online differs from traditional print-based reading. Donald Leu, Julie Coiro, Jill Castek, Laurie Henry, and others attempt to understand how students become adept at reading online to learn and how students acquire the necessary skills, strategies, and dispositions required to do so. Initial work in this area referred to online reading comprehension More recently, however, the construct \"online research and comprehension\" is being used since this more precisely describes the type of reading being described in their work. According to Leu and colleagues, the new literacies of online research and comprehension is a process of problem-based inquiry using information on the Internet. It includes the skills, strategies, dispositions, and social practices that take place as we read online information to learn and is based around five practices: \"At least five processing practices occur during online research and comprehension: (1) reading to identify important questions, (2) reading to locate information, (3) reading to evaluate information critically, (4) reading to synthesize information, and (5) reading to communicate information. Within these five practices reside the skills, strategies, and dispositions that are distinctive to online reading comprehension as well as to others that are also important for offline reading comprehension (Leu, Reinking, et al., 2007).\"\n\nRecent research in the field of new literacies has focused on fan fiction on the internet, especially those stories published online by adolescents (see for example: Black, 2008; Thomas, 2007; Jenkins, 2006). Online fan fiction websites, such as FanFiction.Net, are spaces where fans of all ages, but especially adolescents and younger school-age fans, are able to use these new information and communication technologies (ICTs) to write and craft fictional stories based on their favorite characters in popular media such as movies, television, and graphic novels. Adolescents are participating more and more on these kinds of sites, not only engaging with \"pop culture and media, but also with a broad array of literate activities that are aligned with many school-based literacy practices\"\n\nOf course, adults are just as able to spend time in such online environments—and they do. However, it is interesting to consider that young people were born into a digitally rich world, and thus could be seen as \"digital natives\", and therefore interact with the online environment in a fundamentally distinct way than an older generation of people, so-called \"digital immigrants\". As digital natives, adolescents \"use the online world to share, evaluate, create, report and program with each other differently to digital immigrants,\" and they engage easily and readily with new digital technologies such as instant messaging, file sharing songs and videos, and post all kinds of 'texts', stories, photos, and videos among them. A central characteristic of digital natives is their \"desire to create.\" Digital natives are engaged in \"programming to some extent, whether it be by including a piece of HTML code that personalizes a MySpace page or creating a Flash animation. They are creating web pages, blogs, avatars and worlds; and, in stark contrast to digital immigrants, digital natives readily report and share their ideas.\"\n\nJames Paul Gee described video gaming as a new literacy \"in virtue of the ways game design involves a multimodal code comprising images, actions, words, sounds, and movements that players interpret according to gaming conventions\". Gee notes that game players participate in their game's world as a form of social practice, especially in real-time strategy games in which players can compete with each other to build on land masses, for instance, and in which they can shape and convey their virtual identities as a certain kind of strategist. Video games continue to use new digital technologies to create the symbols players interpret to encode and decode the meanings that constitute the game. Many ways in which students learn literacies, increasingly, are happening outside of school rather than inside of school.\n\nOther researchers have expanded the body of knowledge about video games as a new literacy, particularly as they relate to classroom learning (see for example: Lacasa, Martinez, & Mendez, 2008; Sanford & Madill, 2007). In one study, researchers examined how video games, supported by discussions and dramatic performances in the classroom, can contribute to the development of narrative thought as demonstrated in written compositions in various contexts. Namely, the researchers engaged primary school children in activities designed to teach them to tell, play out, and write stories based on the most popular video game in their classroom, \"Tomb Raider\". Although it was a challenging process at times, researchers discovered that the use of new digital media such as video games actually \"complements the use of other written or audiovisual methods [in the classroom] and permits the development of multiple literacies in the classroom.\"\n\nIt has become clear to many researchers in the field that new literacies research has important implications for the classroom. Kist (2007), for example, observes how new literacies can be used in classroom settings—from the use of rap music to anime to digital storytelling, there are already instances of teachers attempting to blend new literacies with traditional literacy practices in the classroom. Kist asks: \"Can new literacies indeed 'fit' into how we currently 'do' school?\" Kist notes that \"the new literacies instruction that does exist often comes only out of the fortitude of lonely pioneers of new literacies.\"\n\nKnobel and Lankshear (2011) argue that if educators and prospective teachers engage in blogging, or participate in \"affinity spaces\" devoted to practices like fan fiction, video game-playing, music and video remixing, photosharing, and the like, they will better understand how new literacies can better be integrated into worthwhile classroom learning.\n\nLeu, Coiro, Castek, Hartman, Henry and Reinking (2008) have begun to explore the use of a modified instructional model of reciprocal teaching that reflects some of the differences between offline and online reading contexts. In an instructional model known as Internet Reciprocal Teaching, each student has his/her own laptop with access to the Internet and students work in small groups to facilitate interactive group work and discussions about strategy use. In addition, Internet Reciprocal Teaching with online informational resources (as opposed to narrative texts) and strategy instruction on both the common and unique processes by which students navigate through multiple and different texts, rather than the reading of one common text. Teachers and students model their choices about which links are most relevant to a group or individual question through think-alouds. They discuss how to efficiently locate information within different kinds of websites, how to synthesize ideas across multiple texts and media, how to make judgments about the quality of the information and the author's level of expertise, and how to best represent the answers to their questions. Responsibility for monitoring and effectively using these strategies to solve online information problems is gradually released to the students using an instructional scheme with three phases: Phase 1 includes direct, whole class instruction of basic skills and strategies of Internet use; Phase 2 includes group work and the reciprocal exchange of online reading comprehension strategies by students with their peers; and Phase 3 includes online individual inquiry units, sometimes with collaborative efforts involving other students in other classes, perhaps even in other parts of the world, and periodic strategy sessions with groups. Students \"are the first generation to be global publishers to access the raw material of information and to create refined knowledge products for application. They understand the social skills of working with people who they will never meet face to face. They also understand that they need to take more responsibility for managing their own learning. They do not see the boundaries of school as a solid wall. They see school as a global communications center.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The rites of Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, and some Lutheran churches employ an oblation: gifts of bread and wine are offered to God. \n\nLiturgically speaking, there are two oblations: the lesser oblation, sometimes known as the offertory, in which the bread and wine, as yet unconsecrated, are presented and offered to God, and the greater oblation, the oblation proper, in which the Body and Blood of Christ are offered to God, the Father.\n\nThe word oblate is also an ecclesiastical term for persons who have devoted themselves or have been devoted as children by their parents to a monastic life. Oblate is more familiar in the Roman Catholic Church as the name of a Religious Congregation of secular or diocesan priests, the Oblate Fathers of St. Charles. They are placed under the absolute authority of the bishop of the diocese in which they are established and can be employed by him on any duties he may think fit. This congregation was founded in 1578 under the name of Oblates of the Blessed Virgin and St. Ambrose by St. Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan.\n\nA similar congregation of secular priests, the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, was founded at Marseilles in 1815.\n\nIn Catholicism, annualia were a specific type of oblation made for a deceased person by their family, though sources disagree on the nature of the offering. The 1728 \"Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences\" defines the annualia as a solemn Mass celebrated yearly on the date of the deceased person's death. Other sources state that the annualia was a series of Masses performed each day for a year on behalf of the deceased, at the behest of their family, who would pay a stipend to the clergy member performing the rites. The annualia could be extended to a triennial (daily mass for three years) or shortened to a trental (daily mass for thirty days) depending on the needs of the family.\n\n \n"}

Usually the fabric strip is cut on the bias. It may be made from either self-fabric (the same fabric as the object to be ornamented) or contrasting fabric, or of leather.\n\nToday, piping is common on upholstery and decorative pillows, but it is also used on clothing. Piped pocket openings, garment edges, and seams are characteristic of Western wear.\n\nPiping is used extensively on the cassocks of clergy in western rite Christianity, particularly in the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches. Coloured piping is often used on black cassocks to indicate rank.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic church, cassock piping is: black for priests; purple for chaplains of His Holiness; amaranth red for bishops, protonotaries apostolic, and Honorary Prelates; and scarlet red for cardinals.\n\nIn the Anglican church piping is not used universally, many clerics preferring a plain cassock of solid colour. The most common cassock piping in the Anglican church is scarlet red piping for cathedral deans and canons, and for archdeacons; additionally bishops may wear black cassocks with amaranth red (usually called purple) piping.\n"}

The film stars himself with Aditi Inamdar as Malavath Poorna, the youngest girl to climb Mount Everest. The film released in India on 31 March 2017 to positive reviews. The film was screened at the 2017 Palm Springs International Film Festival where it got nominated on the festival's list of \"30 Best Feature Films\". The film also received Special Jury Mention in Direction (for Bose) and Special Jury Mention in Acting (for Aditi Inamdar) from FOI Online Awards in 2018. \n\nPoorna Malavath (Aditi Inamdar) belongs to a Telugu speaking tribal family in Pakala, Nizamabad district in the Telangana state of India. Her parents (mother Lakshmi and father Devidas) are farm labourers. She joins the State Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society for her education. Her talent is spotted by the un-corrupt secretary of the Society Dr R.S. Praveen Kumar (Rahul Bose). The chief minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy (Harsha Vardhan) authorises her for Operation Everest along with a Dalit mountaineer, Sandhanapalli Anand Kumar (Manoj Kumar). In preparation for climbing Mount Everest headed by Coach Shekhar Babu (Gyanendra Tripathi) and Colonel Khan (Arif Zakaria), she treks to mountains of Ladakh and Darjeeling. On 25 May 2014, Poorna scales the highest peak of Mount Everest and, aged 13 years and 11 months, becomes the youngest girl in the world to have reached the summit of Everest.\n\n\nRahul Bose was initially not associated with the film until he was offered the role of Dr. Kumar. He liked the script and offered to direct and produce \"Poorna\", raising funds in four months. Aditi Inamdar was chosen to play the titular role from a group of 109 girls. The film was shot in Pakala village over an 11-day period. Pakala is the village that the real-life Poorna grew up in.\n\nThe soundtrack of Poorna was composed by Salim–Sulaiman while the lyrics were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya.\n\nPoorna received a positive response from the critics based on the reviews. Neil Soans of \"The Times of India\" appreciated the film saying, \"Returning to a directorial capacity after 16 years, Rahul Bose recognizes the beauty in simplicity and uses it to the film's advantage. Grounded performances combined with stirring music elevate this relatively straightforward tale, making it essential viewing not only for the young Indian woman, but for anyone looking to scale great heights against all odds.\" and gave it a rating of 4 stars out of 5. Sarit Ray of \"The Hindustan Times\" praised the film saying, \"Poorna shows you that incredible stories can be told simply. Bollywood can learn from that.\" and gave the film a rating of 4 stars out of 5. Shubhra Gupta of \"The Indian Express\" lauded the movie by saying, \"Fairytales do come true and the story of Poorna Malavath is the proof. Her biopic, directed by Rahul bose, does justice to the extraordinary story of a 13-year-old tribal girl climbing Mt Everest.\" and gave the film a rating of 3 and a half stars out of 5. Saibal Chatterjee of \"NDTV\" said that, \"Poorna is a rare Hindi film that travels to the heart of rural landscape. Even rarer is the use of a smattering of Telugu in the dialogues, which, along with an effective musical score, augments the authenticity of the film's setting and soundscape. It also draws enormous strength from the deeply affecting performances by newcomer Aditi Inamdar (in the role of the resolute Poorna) and Bose himself (as the unwavering mentor firm in his belief that it is his responsibility as a bureaucrat to facilitate positive change in the lives of the most disadvantaged).\" and gave the film a rating of 3 stars out of 5.\n"}

{"id": "14075956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14075956", "title": "Sociological art", "text": "Sociological art\n\nSociological Art is an artistic movement and approach to aesthetics that emerged in France in the early 1970s and became the basis for the Sociological Art Collective formed by , Fred Forest, and Jean-Paul Thénot in 1974.\n\nAs early as 1968, art critics Pierre Restany and François Pluchart used the term “sociological art” to refer to socially engaged and less commercial practices among a diverse set of artists, including body artists Gina Pane and Michel Journiac, Spanish-born video artist Joan Rabascall, Hervé Fischer, Fred Forest, and Jean-Paul Thenot. In the fall of 1973, François Pluchart initiated a debate between Journiac, Pane, Fischer, and Thenot, which was published as “Ten Questions on Sociological Art” (“Dix questions sur l’art sociologique”) in the art magazine artTitudes, which he had founded in 1971.\n\nThe history of sociological art might also be traced through the independent practices of Fischer, Forest, and Thenot who would later form the Sociological Art Collective. These practices must themselves be put into dialogue with broad international artistic tendencies towards social engagement and the social sciences, evident, for instance, in the work of Stephen Willats and Hans Haacke, exhibitions such as Art into Society, Society into Art (Institute of Contemporary Art, London, 1974), and the intellectual histories of social art history and sociology of art.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Forest (born 1933, Algeria) began a series of actions using of audiovisual and communication technologies to challenge conventional artistic media and activity. Images of many works are available at Webnetmuseum He projected slides onto his paintings (\"Tableau Ecran\", 1963), initiated community events in impoverished neighborhoods (\"Family Portrait\", 1967), and used video to engage social spaces (\"Mur d’Arles\" and \"Cabine Telephonique\", 1967). In the early 1970s, his utilization of the press and video as tools of social engagement and political provocation expanded. In January 1972, Forest began his \"Space Media\" project by placing a blank rectangle in the newspaper \"Le Monde\" and inviting readers to fill it in and mail it to him. For an exhibition entitled “Archeology of the Present” (“Archeologie du present”) at the Galerie Germain, Paris, in May 1972, Forest took the street where the gallery was located, Rue Guénegaud, as a topic, creating a video circuit displaying the street in the gallery and the gallery in the windows facing the street and collecting trash from the street to show in the gallery. Pierre Restany carried out short interviews with passersby for an episode of “Forum des Arts\", aired on May 13, 1973. In June 1973, with the collaboration of the philosopher Vilem Flusser and sociologist Philippe Butaud, Forest set up a video studio in a community of retirees to launch a video exchange in the south of France (\"Video Troisieme Age\", 1973). On the occasion of the XII Bienal de São Paulo in October 1973, he effectuated a series of events, including a version of Space Media, a sociological walk, and a procession through the city center with participants holding white placards (\"Blancs evanhit la ville\"), all of which were provocations in the face of the established military dictatorship. Always highly critical of those in power, committed to participatory art, and deeply engaged with new communication technologies, Forest would continue these pursuits after joining the collective in October 1974.\n\nHervé Fischer (born 1941, France) was a student of sociology and taught the sociology of communication and culture at the Sorbonne beginning in the early 1970s. Initially involved with Fischer did a series of “Essuie-mains” paintings with handprints on cloth rolls as a means of deconstructing the medium of painting. He also began various campaigns, grouped under the title “Hygiene de l’art,” to eradicate art of traditional mores and media, and even invited artists to send him their works, which he tore up and displayed in small plastic bags (“La déchirure des oeuvres d’art”). Around 1974, his projects shifted away from the medium of painting toward more marginal and popular visual idioms, such as stamps and street signs, and into performances in the social realm.\n\nJean-Paul Thenot (born 1943, France) was trained as a psychotherapist, a profession he continued while producing art. Around 1969, he began creating artworks, beginning with his “Interventions in the Street,” which consisted of a series of scaled sculptures of everyday objects, such as mousetraps, set up in public space. Around 1970, he moved away from producing objects into largely textual and conceptual works, such as his “Constats d’existence,” typed pages of commentary on contemporary artists that were mailed to various figures in the art world. In 1972, he began conducting interactive surveys about art and perception. In response to the infamous, state-sponsored “Expo 72” (“Douze ans de l’art contemporain en France”), he carried out a large survey inviting respondents to select the most representative French artists and then declared the person whose submitted list was closest to the averaged, final list the honorary curator of a public exhibition opening that May.\n\nThe three artists met at openings and events in the early 1970s and were part of a global trend in artistic practice toward more conceptual and less skill-based art that was intentionally anti-commercial. In France, the events of May and June 1968 had irrevocably changed how many artists conceived of their work. While each artist brought areas of expertise—Forest’s interest in new media, Fischer’s theoretical grounding, and Thenot’s inquiry-based research—a commitment to engage the public, to oppose traditional and commercially-driven art, and to affect social change united the three artists.\n\nIn the summer of 1974, Journiac organized a series of meetings at his apartment on Île Saint-Louis in Paris to discuss the initiation of an artist movement engaged with critical and sociological realities. The meetings brought together artists such as Gina Pane, Bertrand Lavier, Thierry Agullo, Joan Rabscall, Jocelyne Hervé, Sonso, Hervé Fischer, Jean-Paul Thenot as well as art critics François Pluchart and Bernard Teyssedre. It was from these meetings that the impulse to form the Sociological Art Collective emerges, and on October 10, 1974, the Sociological Art Collective was officially declared with the publication in newspaper \"Le Monde\" of its first manifesto, signed by Hervé Fischer, Fred Forest, and Jean-Paul Thénot. From this date onwards, these artists would alternate between practices claiming this lineage and their own personal practices. Concretely speaking, the collective published a number of texts, including three manifestos; organized and effectuated a series of projects, including four group exhibitions and large-scale urban interventions; and founded the Ecole Sociologique Interrogative.\n\nTheir activity instantiates an early moment in the history of what would be called in the mid-1990s relational art or socially-engaged art but also connected with a number of artistic tendencies of the 1970s, such as conceptual art, performance art, and institutional critique. For example, the Collective’s two-week intervention in the southern French town of Perpignan in July 1976, entitled \"Study and Animation of Perpignan\" began with a study of the conditions and needs of neighborhoods in Perpignan by a thirty-person, interdisciplinary team and then led to dozens of direct interventions, which included pop-up exhibitions, screenings, interviews, parties, and a multi-neighborhood photograph swap, all aimed to, as the press release notes, “bring together different neighborhoods [. . .], which although geographically close remain distant at the level of social communication.” After setting out four principles—critique, communication, intervention, and pedagogy—the group proposes sociological art as means to overcome the divide between “a quasi-scientific approach to the environment and a lived connection established among individuals [. . .] and the studied environment.”\n\nThis project and related texts indicate three key aspects that broadly characterized sociological art. First, artistic labor included activities such as organizing, writing, research, and teaching. The expansion of traditional artistic skills to integrate intellectual and white-collar skills related to the broader transition from an industrial economy to service and information economy. Second, projects developed in dialogue with specific sites and their associated audiences. Whether focused on a town or a particular community, sociological art aimed to increase awareness about social conditions of existence through exchange with sites and humans. Third, sociological art was usually time-based and ephemeral and funded primarily by grants, personal finances, and commissions. The remaining material, therefore, consists largely of documentation rather than “rarified” art objects bought, sold, and collected.\n\nFor six years, the Collective carried out a handful of collaborative sociological art projects, participated in colloquia and exhibition, generated a community of collaborators, and provided support for independent work. Interlocutors included Henri Lefebvre, Edgar Morin, Vilem Flusser, Jean Duvignaud, Jorge Glusberg, Kristine Stiles, and numerous artists, including John Latham of the Artist Placement Group, Stephen Willats, and Ken Friedman. Tensions developed among Fischer, Forest, and Thenot, and in 1980, Forest and Thenot published an ad in \"Art Press\" selling the Ecole Sociologique Interrogative, which was located in Fischer’s apartment, and wrote a tract declaring the end of the Collective.\n\n\nSociological Art aimed to develop a critical analysis of art and society through interventionist artistic practices and associated writing that drew on the methods and theories of sociology. It envisioned art in terms of interaction, animation, pedagogy, and the creation of structures of exchange, provocation, and disruption of conventional social behaviors with a view to denouncing all and any forms of conditioning. As summarized by Fred Forest: “The practical aim of Sociological Art is to provide the necessary conditions of existence for various devices that frame a given efficient and effective questioning or investigation, thereby establishing the optimal conditions for a situation of intersubjectivity.” Sociological Art was a politically engaged response to an art world that was perceived as being out of touch both with the technologies and the society of its time. This stance was in strict opposition to reigning modernist and formalist dogmas that privileged medium specificity and authorial intention.\n\nVarious theoretical influences can be traced through sociological art. In a classical examine of Situationist détournement, Sociological Art aimed to draw attention to the channels of power and mass communication it was aiming to undermine. It called upon derision, simulacrum and participation in order to explode or alter a certain reality structured by the social codes of the time. Considering how ideology structured society related to contemporaneous analyses in French critical theory, such as Louis Althusser’s idea of Ideological State Apparatus as well as Foucault’s writing on power. At the same time, sub-disciplines within the social sciences emerged to study art and culture, including the sociology of art and visual anthropology, and applied novel method and theories to draw attention to art’s socio-economic frames.\n\nFollowing the dissipation of the Sociological Art Collective, its founders retained certain sociological tenets in their later work and pursuits. Fischer continued work with the Ecole Sociologique Interrogative and carried out large-scale urban interventions. He then moved to Montreal, where he worked as a curator of new media, and in 2010, he has a large retrospective exhibition in Céret. Forest launched his subsequent theory of Communication aesthetics and continued his work as a teacher and artist, becoming an important early theorist and practitioners of net and internet art. In 2007, Forest had a retrospective exhibition at Slought Foundation. Thenot focused on the therapeutique potential of art and video in his work as a psychotherapist. In 2010, he had an exhibition, called an \"Intervention d'art sociologique\" at Galerie Flux in Liege that included a video interview with the artist. All three continued to write prodigiously and have recently exhibited their artwork again. Though relatively unknown today, Sociological Art is thoroughly emblematic of the historical upheavals of the late 1960s and 1970s in France and Europe generally and prefigures many of the most prominent trends in art since the mid-1990s.\n\n"}

As early as Ancient Greece, Pythagoras believed in something called the \"harmony of the spheres\". He believed that since planets and the stars all moved in the universe according to mathematical equations that these mathematical equations could be translated into musical notes and thus produce a symphony. This idea was explored further throughout Western history under the theories of Musica universalis. Some more recent and widely different examples are \"The Planets\" by Gustav Holst, and the song \"Space Oddity\" by David Bowie. Outer space also appears as a theme in \"space age\" retro pop music, such as Stereolab's \"Space-Age Bachelor Pad Music\".\n\nMusic about outer space attracts enthusiastic listeners from all walks of life. Some have created web pages to share their interests. NASA, JPL, and the US Governmental Centennial of Flight Commission even have a webpages showcasing and discussing music about outer space.\n\nIn 1958, Karl-Birger Blomdahl composed an opera Aniara to a libretto by Erik Lindegren based on the poem Aniara by Harry Martinson, a tragedy set aboard a space ship.\n\nIn 1958, Russ Garcia recorded an exotica album called Fantastica on Capitol Records that was about space travel.\n\nIn 1969, The Beatles released single Across the Universe.\n\nIn 1972, Elton John released single Rocket Man.\n\nThe same year, Tangerine Dream released their double album Zeit, featuring space-related track titles such as \"Birth of Liquid Plejades\" and \"Nebulous Dawn\", as well as cover art depicting a solar eclipse. It is considered one of the first (possibly the first) Dark ambient albums.\n\nIn 2016, Avenged Sevenfold released their album The Stage, a concept album about the universe, and artificial intelligence. The song \"Exist\" contains a spoken word section written and performed by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.\n\nEduard Artemyev has made space-themed music, for example for a space film Solaris (1972), although his best known and successfully covered space-themed sounding piece might be the theme song for non-space film Siberiade (1979).\n\nThe Japanese musician Isao Tomita has produced many albums with space-based themes, such as \"The Planets\" (1976), his version of Holst's suite; \"Kosmos\" (1978); \"Bermuda Triangle\" (1979); \"Dawn Chorus (Canon of the Three Stars)\" (1984); \"Space Walk – Impressions Of An Astronaut\" (compilation, 1984); \"Mind of the Universe – Live at Linz\" (1985); \"Back to the Earth – Live in New York\" (1988); and \"Nasca Fantasy\" (supporting Kodo, 1994).\n\nThe Vangelis album \"Albedo 0.39\" (1976) is entirely devoted to space, while a segment of \"Heaven and Hell\" (1975) was used as the theme to the PBS television series \"\" by Carl Sagan. His work \"Mythodea: Music for NASA's Mars Odyssey Mission\" is reflective of his interest in space exploration. \nMike Oldfield's 1994 album \"The Songs of Distant Earth\" was based on Arthur C. Clarke's SF novel \"Songs of Distant Earth\". Pop songs also mention outer space, such as Chris de Burgh's \"A Spaceman Came Travelling\", the Bonzo Dog Band's \"I'm the Urban Spaceman\", David Bowie's \"Space Oddity\", Elton John's \"Rocket Man\", Major Tom by Peter Schilling, and Deep Purple's \"Space Truckin'\". \"To Our Children's Children's Children\" by The Moody Blues was a 1969 album inspired by spaceflight.\n\nSeveral albums have featured music inspired by the Apollo space program. In 1983, Brian Eno with his brother Roger Eno and producer/recording artist Daniel Lanois, composed the score for the film \"For All Mankind\", a documentary of NASA's Apollo program; an album of the music, \",\" was later released. On The Orb's 1991 two-disc debut album, \"Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld\", disc one of features an ambient musical simulation of the Apollo 11 moon journey, including excerpts of NASA recordings of the radio conversations between Mission Control and the astronauts in space.\n\nThe filk anthology albums \"Minus Ten and Counting\" (1983) and \"To Touch the Stars\" (2003) celebrate and promote the exploration of outer space.\n\nAuthor and classical music critic David Hurwitz describes Joseph Haydn's choral and chamber orchestra piece, \"The Creation\", composed in 1798, as space music, both in the sense of the sound of the music, (\"a genuine piece of 'space music' featuring softly pulsating high violins and winds above low cellos and basses, with nothing at all in the middle ... The space music gradually drifts towards a return to the movement's opening gesture ... \"); and in the manner of its composition, relating that Haydn conceived \"The Creation\" after discussing music and astronomy with William Herschel, oboist and astronomer (discoverer of the planet Uranus).\n\nAnother band to use space as musical inspiration is the Christian \"Astro-Rock\" group Brave Saint Saturn, whose three albums, \"So Far from Home\", \"The Light of Things Hoped For\", and \"Anti-Meridian\", form a trilogy that chronicles the journey of the fictional spaceship, the \"USS Gloria\", on a trip to survey the moons of Saturn. The music uses space narratives, lingo, samples and quotes to portray the journey.\n\nSoundtracks of science fiction movies and television and radio series often feature music associated with outer space, such as \"Star Wars\", \"Star Trek\", \"Doctor Who\", \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", \"Red Dwarf\", \"The X-Files\", and others.\n\nThe theremin is an electronic musical instrument associated with a very eerie sound, which has led to its use in movie soundtracks such as those in \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\".\n\nMany forms of music are used Observatory and Planetarium shows, particularly genres such as Electronic music, classical music, Space music, and Space rock. Some artists, such as Geodesium, specialize in creating custom music for Planetariums.\n\nDuring the 1970s, IMAX's OMNIMAX (now IMAX Dome) film system was conceived to operate on planetarium screens. More recently, some planetariums have re-branded themselves as \"dome theaters,\" with broader offerings including wide-screen or \"wraparound\" films, fulldome video, and laser shows that combine music with laser-drawn patterns.\n\nEnergy sources in the atmosphere, such as lightning, can produce sounds (\"sferics\", \"tweeks\", and \"whistlers\") in the very low frequency (VLF) radio band.\n\nObjects in space – the Sun, planets, stars, quasars, pulsars, galaxies, and active galaxies – all produce signals that, if received (usually through radio astronomy dishes and processed), can be used by a musician as the basis for any kind of composition imaginable. \nScientists with an interest in space-based sounds include:\nArtists/bands who have included space sounds in their works include:\n\n"}

The film was shot in Sequoia National Park in California in 1981.\n\nTwo American hikers, Steve (Dean Russell) and Charlie (John Batis), venture into the local forest along with their girlfriends, Sharon (Tomi Barrett) and Teddi (Ann Wilkinson). However, John (Gary Kent), a cannibalistic woodsman, is lurking in the forest putting these four friends at risk.\n\n\nAccording to an interview with actor Gary Kent, writer-director Don Jones lost his house acquiring funding for the making of the film: \"He hocked his house to make the film. He's one of the few directors ever that I know of, besides myself, who actually paid his deferments...When he finally got money from the film, he paid us first before he paid off his house.\"\n\nThe film was released theatrically in America. It also ran under the title \"Terror in the Forest\", released in 1982 by Fury Films Ltds.\n\nIt was released as a video in the 1980s and 1990s by Prism Entertainment and Starmaker Video.\n\nOn November 7, 2006, Code Red released the film on DVD with an anamorphic widescreen transfer, a stills gallery, and commentary with director Don Jones and Gary Kent.\n\nAs a part of their Exploitation Cinema line, Code Red rereleased the film in 2009 as a double feature with \"Don't Go In The Woods\". This release did not include the commentary or stills gallery, but retained the widescreen transfer.\n\n\"TV Guide\" awarded the film one out of four stars, writing: \"This obscure low-budgeter gives the \"Friday the 13th\" formula a bit of a twist, introducing both a cannibal angle and ghosts. A human-flesh-eating madman terrorizes people in a patch of woods, haunted by the ghosts of his murdered wife and children. A poorly made effort that barely saw a theatrical release and is now available everywhere on videotape for less than 10 bucks.\" Todd Martin from \"HorrorNews.net\" gave the film a negative review, stating that the film was \"boring, lame, and the death scenes left a lot to be desired\". \"Hysteria Lives\" gave the film 1/5 stars, calling it \"a grade Z, back-packing slash-a-thon which starts with too very wooden (but hey that's ok, it ties in nicely with the forest theme!), middle aged actors being offed by briefly glimpsed back wood loon.\"\nBrett Gallman from \"Oh, the Horror!\" wrote, \"\"The Forest\" is an incoherent mess of a flick... There’s almost no redeeming value to the film, as the acting is terrible, the music is generic, and the direction is mediocre. I can somewhat praise the photography, as I have seen worse in these low budget slashers... Beyond this, you only have a half baked story about a cannibal man and his ghost kids that only registers on the unintentional comedy scale.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1015819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1015819", "title": "The Order of the Stick", "text": "The Order of the Stick\n\nThe Order of the Stick (OOTS) is a comedic webcomic that satirizes tabletop role-playing games and medieval fantasy. The comic is written and drawn by Rich Burlew, who illustrates the comic in a stick figure style.\n\nTaking place in a magical world that loosely operates by the rules of the 3.5 edition of the role-playing game \"Dungeons and Dragons\" (\"D&D\"), the comic follows the sometimes farcical exploits of six adventurers as they strive to save the world from an evil lich sorcerer. Much of the comic's humor stems from the characters' awareness of the game rules that affect their lives or from having anachronistic knowledge of modern culture. This in turn is often used by the author to parody various aspects of role-playing games and fantasy fiction. While primarily comedic in nature, \"The Order of the Stick\" features a continuing storyline serialized in one-to four-page episodes, with over 1000 such episodes released so far.\n\nAlthough it is principally distributed online through the website \"Giant in the Playground\", seven book collections have been published, including several print-only stories (\"On the Origin of PCs\" and \"Start of Darkness\"). An alternate version of the strip appeared monthly in \"Dragon\" magazine for 22 issues; these strips, among others, are collected in \"Snips, Snails and Dragon Tales\".\n\n\"The Order of the Stick\" began its run on September 29, 2003, on what was Rich Burlew's personal site for gaming articles at the time. Burlew initially intended the strip to feature no plot whatsoever—depicting an endless series of gags drawn from the D&D rules instead—but Burlew quickly changed his mind, and began laying down hints of a storyline as early as strip #13. The strip was originally produced to entertain people who came to his website to read articles, but it quickly became the most popular feature, leading Burlew to eventually abandon writing articles almost entirely.\n\n\"The Order of the Stick\" began as a twice-weekly comic that debuted new strips on Mondays and Thursdays. When presales of the first \"OOTS\" compilation book allowed Burlew to make writing his full-time job, he increased the number to three per week.<ref name=\"GITPNews2/17/05\"></ref> Since 2007, the comic has been published on an irregular schedule due to the author's ongoing health concerns.<ref name=\"GITPNews7/7/07\"></ref>\n\nIn September 2012, Burlew had an accident in which the tendons in his right hand were severed,<ref name=\"GITPNews9/19/12\"></ref> resulting in a hiatus until December 31, 2012.<ref name=\"GITPNews12/31/12\"></ref> At the end of September 2013, Burlew estimated that the story will be finished in \"about four years\".\n\nOn September 30, 2005, Burlew announced that \"The Order of the Stick\" would begin appearing in \"Dragon\", the long-running official \"D&D\" magazine. The strip debuted in the December 2005 issue, on the last page of the magazine. The following issue, \"OOTS\" appeared as a four-panel strip in the magazine's interior, but by the February 2006 issue, it had returned to a full-page strip on the last page, a position it would hold until the magazine's last print issue in September 2007.<ref name=\"GITPNews4/19/07\"></ref>\n\nThe \"Dragon\" version of \"OOTS\" featured the same main cast of six adventurers, but saw them adventuring in an unspecified underground location. None of the villains or supporting characters from the online strip appeared, with the exception of Mr. Jones and Mr. Rodriguez, who appeared together twice. Burlew has stated that the events of the \"Dragon\" strips take place in an alternate universe from the online strip, and events in one storyline do not affect the other.<ref name=\"GITPNews10/10/05\"></ref> This status quo was broken for the sake of a joke, however, when a character in the online strip referred to the July 2006 \"Dragon\" strip by claiming that \"I told you that in one of the Dragon Magazine comics, so I'm not even sure that's the same continuity.\"\n\nStarting in January 2013, a new version of the comic appeared in \"Gygax Magazine\", a new tabletop gaming magazine published in print and digital formats.\n\nThe comic is created directly on a computer using the vector-based software Adobe Illustrator, and the art style has been upgraded several times. In strip #103, the curved and crooked panel borders were replaced with straight—though still slanted—black lines. Burlew now questions how he ever thought the initial format was acceptable. After he sprained his wrist in 2005, Burlew used some of the time he took off from writing the comic to improve the designs of the main cast, straightening their lines and adding tiny details like the runes stitched along the edge of Vaarsuvius' cloak. These changes were humorously acknowledged by the characters themselves when they premiered. Burlew made adjustments to the colors that were required when the material was to appear in print for the first time. The later comics feature more frequent double- and even triple-page strips than in the early days, when longer strips were reserved for special occasions (such as reaching #200). In strip #947 the artwork was upgraded again, adding volume to characters' limbs that were previously drawn as simple stick-figure lines. In addition to these permanent improvements to the art, two variant art styles are used to distinguish the events of certain comics from those taking place in the story's present. Historical events relating to the plot are portrayed in a hand-drawn crayon style both in the online comic and in \"Start of Darkness\", while events in the \"prequel\" print-exclusive stories are shown in black-and-white.\n\nBurlew has said that he includes stances on social topics in his comic because he worries about the impact of his work beyond momentary distractions. He has also written that he is attempting to compensate for past instances of \"unintentional sexism and/or insensitivity to gender issues\" but, being a straight white male, he finds difficult to talk authoritatively about minorities without the proper knowledge.\n\nThe comic's central protagonists, known collectively as \"The Order of the Stick,\" are a party of adventurers who are questing to destroy an evil lich that is planning to conquer the world. Though they have many allies, the official members of the Order of the Stick are:\n\n\nThe comic's central antagonists include the following:\n\nWhile the online version of \"The Order of the Stick\" unfolds continuously, the strips have been broken down into plot arcs for purposes of publication; the plot summary that follows breaks the story down into these arcs for clarity. Burlew notes in the commentary of \"War and XPs\" that the strips contained within that volume were the first to be plotted with publication in mind from the very beginning. Several volumes have been released in book-only format: \"On the Origin of PCs,\" a prequel to the heroes' adventures; \"Start of Darkness,\" a prequel to the villains' escapades; and \"Snips, Snails and Dragon Tails,\" a collection of all the \"Dragon Magazine\" comics plus 80 pages of new material.\n\nThe webcomic begins with the Order fighting goblins and other monsters on their way through the Dungeon of Dorukan (although the first volume of the printed edition later included a preamble showing how the Order finds and enters the Dungeon). They are led by Roy Greenhilt on a quest to destroy a lich sorcerer named Xykon. Roy is motivated by nightly visits from the ghost of his father, from whom he receives a cryptic warning. The Order briefly joins forces with an adventuring party known as the Linear Guild, led by Nale (the evil twin of the Order's happy-go-lucky bard, Elan). The Guild eventually betrays the Order, but the Order prevails due to Roy's sudden understanding of his father's prophecy. Durkon Thundershield, the Order's dutiful dwarf cleric of Thor, enjoys a sexual encounter with the Guild's dwarf cleric of Loki Hilgya Firehelm, but they shortly afterwards part in tears. The Order goes on to battle Xykon near a mysterious magical gate. Xykon shatters Roy's ancestral sword, but before he can release his ace-in-the-hole (a powerful monster shrouded in darkness), Roy flings him into a deadly mystic rune that protects the gate. Xykon's body is destroyed, but his disembodied soul is ferreted to safety by his lieutenant, Redcloak. The book ends with Elan accidentally destroying the entire dungeon, including the gate, by activating another magic rune. The Order escapes to safety. The printed book contains strips 1–121, plus extras.\n\nThe Order travels to Wooden Forest, where Vaarsuvius slays a black dragon and they loot its hoard in order to retrieve a rare \"starmetal\" to repair Roy's broken sword. The party is arrested by the paladin Miko Miyazaki for the capital crime of destroying the magical gate in the Dungeon of Dorukan. While stopping at an inn, the party loses the dragon's treasure in an explosion, the shock of which renders Haley unable to speak coherently (rendered as cryptograms in the comic). In Azure City, Miko's liege, Lord Shojo, informs the Order that the gate they destroyed is one of five gates that reinforce the structure of the universe. Without them, a god-killing abomination known as the Snarl would escape and destroy all of creation. The Order is put on trial, but acquitted with the help of Celia, a sylph they had aided in the Dungeon of Dorukan. Shojo later explains that the trial was a sham to get the Order's assistance in defending the remaining gates. Roy reluctantly agrees once he learns that Xykon has survived and is recruiting a massive army of hobgoblins to seize the remaining gates. As payment for their future aid, each member of the Order receives a boon, one of which is the repair of Roy's sword. The printed book contains strips 122–301, plus extras.\n\nThe Order makes a brief diversion to Cliffport to confront the Linear Guild. After Nale frames Elan for the Linear Guild's crimes, Elan escapes from prison and reunites with Haley with the help of a dashing swordsman named Julio Scoundrel. Haley recovers her speech and confesses her love for Elan, who reciprocates. The Order returns to Azure City to ask Lord Shojo for further directions. Miko, who does not know about the plan to find the gates but does know about Xykon's army, overhears the conversation and jumps to the conclusion that both are in league with Xykon. She strikes her master down, and is immediately stripped of her paladin status by her gods and imprisoned. Xykon's hobgoblins attack the city the next day. The Order helps Shojo's heir, Hinjo, hold the city walls. Xykon attempts to circumvent the defenders, but Roy leaps up to the zombified dragon that Xykon is riding, and the two duel once more. Xykon overpowers Roy and sends him falling to his death. Xykon and Redcloak attempt to activate the gate hidden within the castle's throne room, but Miko, having escaped from prison, destroys the gate in an attempt to protect it. In the ensuing explosion, Miko is killed, and Xykon and Redcloak escape. The city falls to the hobgoblins. Haley and Belkar become separated from the party when they go to recover Roy's corpse, while the others sail away with Hinjo and the surviving Azurites. The printed book contains strips 302–484, plus extras.\n\nRoy finds himself in the Afterlife with his father, who cannot rest until Xykon is gone. Roy is found worthy of entrance to paradise, but he returns to his father's side when he learns that almost four months have passed. Looking down, he sees that Haley and Belkar have formed an underground resistance movement in hobgoblin-occupied Azure City. Haley accidentally summons Celia, who convinces her to look for the other half of the party. Their travels take them to Greysky City, where Haley is betrayed by one of her old friends in the Thieves' Guild, but the Order triumphs over the Guild in the ensuing battle. Meanwhile, Elan, Durkon, and Vaarsuvius stop the nobleman Kubota's plot to assassinate Hinjo, and Vaarsuvius kills Kubota after capturing him. Vaarsuvius then flies to an isolated island to search for Haley, where Vaarsuvius is attacked and defeated by the mother of the black dragon whom Vaarsuvius had killed during \"No Cure for the Paladin Blues\". After the dragon threatens to kill Vaarsuvius' children, Vaarsuvius contracts with fiends to rent out the souls of three evil spellcasters. Vaarsuvius then kills the black dragon and her entire lineage by \"renting\" an epic \"Familicide\" spell. Loath to waste this increased arcane power, Vaarsuvius teleports to Azure City to defeat Xykon, but is knocked out, during the battle, and loses control of the souls. Witnessing this, the paladin O-Chul escapes from prison and attempts to destroy Xykon's phylactery, but it falls into a storm drain and is lost. Vaarsuvius and O-Chul are teleported to Hinjo's fleet by Xykon's monster in the darkness, which O-Chul had befriended during his imprisonment. There, the Order regroups and Durkon resurrects Roy. The story arc ends with the Order sailing towards the next gate and Vaarsuvius apologizing to the neglected familiar Blackwing, who tells Vaarsuvius that it saw what appeared to be another world in the rift in space caused by the Snarl. The printed book contains strips 485–672, plus extras.\n\nWhile O-Chul and Lien travel north to Kraagor's gate, the Order sails to the Western Continent. Their search for Girard's Gate takes them to the Empire of Blood, where Tarquin, the Empress's chief general (and the true power behind the throne), dramatically reveals himself to be Elan's father. Tarquin gives the Order a tip that Girard's relative Orrin Draketooth can be found in Windy Canyon. However, Tarquin and the Linear Guild join forces and plot to seize the gate for themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, in Azure City, Redcloak's troops recover Xykon's phylactery and destroy the resistance's base. Redcloak, who is plotting against Xykon, gives him a fake phylactery and keeps the real one for himself.\n\nThe Order discovers a magically cloaked pyramid in Windy Canyon, but once inside finds the entire Draketooth clan dead — an unexpected result of Vaarsuvius's \"Familicide\" spell, which causes him/her to flee into the pyramid in horror. The Linear Guild arrives shortly after in hot pursuit. Belkar, Durkon, and Tarquin become separated from their respective groups in the ensuing battle. Belkar and Durkon encounter Tarquin's cleric Malack, who kills Durkon, turning him into a vampire thrall. Belkar reunites with the Order and they continue deeper into the pyramid, overcoming various traps and illusions along the way. When they discover the gate, Roy decides to destroy it, and consequently the entire pyramid, rather than risk it falling into the hands of Evil. Again the Order sees what appears to be another world in the rift.\n\nWith Tarquin gone, Nale takes the opportunity to kill Malack, freeing Durkon who rejoins the Order. Tarquin kills Nale for disobedience upon returning and sends a vast army to attack the Order. With the help of Vaarsuvius (who was temporarily dragged into hell by the archfiends so that s/he could not prevent the Order from destroying the Gate), and Julio Scoundrel swooping in at the last moment, the Order is triumphant. Tarquin is left in the middle of the desert as the Order flies away on Julio's airship towards the last Gate.\n\nThe final strip reveals that the Northern Death God, Hel, has placed a spirit in the vampirized body of Durkon, and plans for the spirit to bring ruin to the Dwarven lands as Durkon helplessly struggles trapped in his own body. The printed book contains strips 673–946, plus extras.\n\nJulio's airship gets damaged in a storm, and the Order stop in the steampunk-inspired gnome town of Tinkertown to repair it. Haley deals with her old enemies, while Roy and Durkon search for a cleric who can cure Durkon's vampirism. They encounter Veldrina and Wrecan, who are traveling to the Godsmoot, an interfaith council of clerics. The Order flies the pair to the Godsmoot with the goal of restoring Durkon to life.\n\nAt the Godsmoot, they discover that due to the threat of the Snarl, the gods are casting votes (conveyed through their mortal representatives) on whether to destroy the world and start over. Durkon, revealed to be the High Priest of Hel, votes in favor of the destruction, causing a tie. With the swing votes of demigod priests potentially dooming the world, Roy tries to eliminate the High Priest of Hel to negate the vote. They fight to a stand still and the demigod priests vote and also cause a tie – with the priest of Dvalin needing to consult with the Dwarven Council before he can cast a vote. It is then revealed that Durkon has killed and vampirized all the members of the Creed of Stone, who walk into the room. Durkon abdicates his position as High Priest and hands it over to one of the newly formed vampires as he and a few other vampires teleport to the dwarven lands to dominate the dwarven council so they will vote in Hel's favor. Roy regroups with his team and they fly to a dwarven city named Firmament.\n\nAfter defeating a tribe of giants, the Order gets to the city, where they gain allies (among them Hilgya Firehelm, accompanied by her and Durkon's infant son) and fight newly vampirised dwarves. The Order takes the fight to the High Priest and his vampire minions, but, although they initially prevail, the vampires manage to hypnotize most of the Order, breaking their plans and leaving all of them unconscious. However, in the meantime Durkon (who, throughout the book, has been forced to show the High Priest his memories) tricks the High Priest into absorbing the rest of his memories all at once, effectively turning him into a copy of Durkon, for a time long enough to get their body destroyed by Belkar. Durkon's soul ascends to the afterlife, where he encounters Thor, who reveals information about the nature and history of the Snarl, the Gods and their creations.\nThe world the characters inhabit is similar to those depicted in \"Dungeons & Dragons\", complete with functional magic and monsters. According to an introductory strip included in \"Dungeon Crawlin' Fools\", the world operates under three sets of laws: Physics, Magic, and Gaming (specifically, paper-and-pencil roleplaying games). Though ostensibly medieval in nature, the \"OOTS\" world is rife with anachronisms, both social (such as college admissions standards for the Evil Ivy League) and technological (such as coffee makers). The characters make references to real-life individuals (Michael Jackson or Jessica Biel), fictional characters from other sources (Green Lantern and Firestorm), or pop culture in general. Sometimes, fictional characters (or explicit \"third-rate knock-offs\" thereof) from other fantasy works cross paths with the main characters, such as the halfling \"Frudu Biggins\".\n\nThree main areas of the world's geography have been mentioned: a mainland continent consisting of the Northern Lands and the Southern Lands, and the separate Western Continent. The Northern Lands seem to consist mostly of grassy plains and mountains, which resemble medieval Europe in setting, but with a wider variety of skin colors than was present in medieval Europe. For example, Roy Greenhilt and his family have dark brown skin, and are not referred to as coming from a different area or having a different cultural background than the characters with light skin. Other characters, such as the lawyer Phil Rodriguez, show a third (light brown) skin color. Non-human races, which are often player characters in \"D&D\", such as dwarves and gnomes, have both dark- and light-skinned members as well.\n\nMost of the seen Southern Lands seem to be mountainous, rocky and barren, though what seems to be a more tropical forested nation and a colder region have briefly been seen. The people of the Southern Lands are significantly different ethnically and culturally, with nations roughly analogous to real-world Asian cultures such as China and India, the most prominent of which was Azure City, which greatly resembled feudal Japan (though a few Chinese elements were present). Four separate areas in the South besides Azure city are briefly shown.\n\nThe Western Continent is split into an Elven forest in the north and an expansive desert in the south, separated from each other by the \"Goaway Mountains\". Due to the continent's fragile political state, a large number of nations cluster around the edges of the desert. The Western Continent includes Vaarsuvius's homeland, and is close to an island with abandoned Elven ruins, where the Azurite fleet landed.\n\nThere are three primary polytheistic pantheons worshiped by humans, all based on real-life mythology: the Northern Pantheon (Norse deities led by Odin), the Southern Pantheon (the Twelve Gods of the Chinese zodiac), and the Western Pantheon (Mesopotamian deities like Nergal and Tiamat). Dwarves worship the Northern Pantheon. Lizardfolk worship the Western Pantheon. Elves have their own gods separate from the main pantheons.\n\nThere once was a fourth primary pantheon, the Eastern Pantheon, based on the Greek pantheon led by Zeus. These deities were killed by the Snarl and so had no role in the re-creation of the world; only people who are privy to the story of the Snarl have ever even heard of them.\n\nEach pantheon has a deific color: yellow for the North, red for the West, blue for the South (whence \"Azure\" City), and green for the East.\n\nLike most of the worlds of \"Dungeons & Dragons\", the \"Order of the Stick\" universe contains a verifiable afterlife—a series of planes to which dead souls are drawn. The afterlife in the \"OOTS\" world resembles the Great Wheel cosmology, with separate planes for the departed of each alignment. To enter the afterlife, a planar being must assess whether or not a soul has fulfilled the tenets of their alignment throughout their life. Some Dwarves might be exempt from this rule, as those who do not die honorably in battle (or from liver failure due to alcohol poisoning) are sent to the plane of Hel upon death, regardless of alignment.\n\nThe Lawful Good afterlife plane has been portrayed in the comic as a mountain with seven plateaus loosely based on Mount Celestia, and the side of the mountain the deceased enter from in depends on their religion. The first plateau is dedicated to satisfying physical desires, such as for sex and food, while higher levels offer spiritual satisfaction. The seventh level, at the mountain's peak, holds “true perfect enlightenment.” Below the mountain is a demi plane of blue skies and clouds, where dead souls, archons, and gods from all of the Good-aligned planes can look down on the mortal world.\n\nMuch of the humor of \"The Order of the Stick\" is based on roleplaying games (particularly the \"Dungeons and Dragons\" 3rd Edition ruleset), with characters freely discussing game mechanics, such as experience points, skill sets, and random encounters. The characters know very well that they live in a world controlled by the rules of roleplaying games, but attempt to function normally within it, often with nonsensical results. Characters have been shown browsing through rulebooks for the \"D&D\" game to select a certain monster for use, or to learn about a new class. Common techniques of players and Dungeon Masters are spoofed, such as the weather of the campaign world changing to herald a dramatic encounter, or a player who does not bother to complete the details of his character's backstory. Burlew's satirical humor addresses many of the clichés of the fantasy genre as a whole, often by twisting them in new and different ways.\n\nBurlew occasionally creates characters and situations specifically to highlight what he considers common problems and deficits among roleplayers. The controversial paladin Miko Miyazaki is one such character; Burlew has said that she represents the division among players of the game over whether or not one character should be allowed to \"police\" the remainder of an adventuring party. He has referred to her as being \"one of the WORST ways to play a paladin.\" Another example is the creation myth of the \"OOTS\" world, which shows a group of gods bickering over how to create the world—accidentally creating the world-devouring Snarl through their refusal to compromise. In the commentary for \"No Cure for the Paladin Blues\", Burlew likens this story to the squabbles that might arise in a group of roleplayers, which threaten to destroy the fun that they have created together.\n\nThe comic occasionally directly comments on current events in the roleplaying game industry by the inclusion of characters that represent the participants. In the last three comics to appear in \"Dragon\", the \"OOTS\" members encounter a green dragon that serves as a self-identified allegorical figure for the magazine itself. The dragon recounts the magazine's long history, complete with representations of its various publishers, including a wizard of the coast and Mr. Potato Head (the signature toy of Wizards of the Coast's corporate parent, Hasbro). In the final issue, the dragon escapes the wizard of the coast's lawyers by flying through a room featuring characters from many of the comics that have appeared in \"Dragon\" over the years, such as \"Wormy\", \"Knights of the Dinner Table\", and \"What's New with Phil & Dixie\", before the \"OOTS\" characters directly thank the dragon for its long years of service. This theme was employed again when a character in the online strip voiced Burlew's eulogy to \"D&D\" co-creator Gary Gygax immediately after his death was announced.<ref name=\"News3/4/2008\"></ref> The memorial comic was widely cited among websites covering Gygax's death. Burlew created a similar tribute strip for \"D&D\" co-creator Dave Arneson after his death.\n\nDue to its reflection of the comical excesses of gaming culture, \"The Order of the Stick\" has been hailed as \"must reading\" for those who play roleplaying games and \"the roleplaying comic to beat\". Critics sometimes cite the insular nature of in-jokes regarding the \"D&D\" rules that crop up regularly (especially in the early part of the comic's run) as a barrier to new readers, noting that without a working knowledge of fantasy roleplaying games, much of the humor may fall flat. However, the comic is just as often seen as being accessible to casual readers without such gaming knowledge due to the strength of the main cast's portrayals and abundance of character-based humor. The comic has been praised for its \"shrewd writing\" and \"increasingly intricate and cleverly scripted adventures\", as well as its execution. One webcomic critic has called it \"one of the few very simplistically drawn comics that can pull [off] an extensive storyline.\" Particular praise has been given to the scenes depicting the siege of Azure City, which has been called \"a war worthy of Peter Jackson.\"\n\nThe comic's stick figure art has received mixed reviews. Some critics praise its \"surprisingly expressive art\", with \"PvP\" cartoonist Scott Kurtz adding that the comic would not be as funny or have as much heart if the characters were drawn in any other style. Others denounce its simple geometric characters as \"merely functional\" or (as fellow webcomic creator Josh Lesnick put it) only \"good for someone who isn't really an artist\". Burlew has defended his art style several times in public statements, stating he has no lack of proficiency at drawing, but intentionally developed a clean and simple style to help the reader focus on the humor. He has pointed out that the primary goal of comic art is to communicate the actions of the characters, which his style does as well as any other. Burlew has addressed similar criticisms within the comic itself several times, either by contrasting his usual art with more realistic drawings or by simply putting self-deprecating dialogue regarding his style into the mouths of characters.\n\nSurveys of webcomic site traffic held since May 2007 have consistently placed \"The Order of the Stick\" as one of the 10 most widely read webcomics in existence. Burlew has estimated that he has about 650,000 dedicated readers and up to one million additional casual readers. Every day, thousands of the comic's readers participate in the comic's official forums, which feature discussion of \"The Order of the Stick\" and roleplaying games in general. Many participants are noted for adopting avatars drawn in emulation of Burlew's stick figure style, with some fans even creating additional \"fancomics\" in that style on the site's message board or their own sites.\n\n\"The Order of the Stick\" received two nominations for Britain's 2008 Eagle Awards, for Favourite Web-Based Comic and Favourite Original Graphic Novel (for \"Start of Darkness\"). \"OOTS\" won the former category, but lost the latter one to Alan Moore's \"\". In announcing the results on his site, Burlew stated he was pleased that he didn't win the Favourite Original Graphic Novel category, saying, \"I don't think I want to live in a world where a parody stick figure comic beats one of the comic industry's top writers.\" \"No Cure for the Paladin Blues\", the comic's second print compilation, won a 2007 Gold ENnie award. \"OOTS\" has been nominated for ten Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards, of which it has won five. It was named Best Long Form Comic in 2008, Best Gaming Comic and Best Long Form Comic in 2007, and Best Fantasy Comic in 2006, and tied for Best Fantasy Comic in 2005.\n\nThe Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art in New York City included \"The Order of the Stick #443\" in its first webcomic-only exhibit, \"Infinite Canvas: The Art of Webcomics\".\n\n\"The Order of the Stick\" books are published by Giant in the Playground Games, a small press publishing company formed by \"OOTS\" creator Rich Burlew. The books are widely distributed to online and brick-and-mortar retailers in the hobby game market, as well as to comic book direct retailers. All four books feature an introduction by the author, as well as a preface written in the voice of one of the characters from the strip. The compilation books feature a number of pages of \"bonus material\", primarily additional strips inserted into various points in the story. The bonus material for \"Dungeon Crawlin' Fools\", for example, includes a nine-page opening to the story that Burlew felt introduced the characters in a more organic way than the online comic's cast page.\n\nOn Jan. 22nd, 2012, Burlew launched a Kickstarter campaign to get \"The Order of the Stick: War and XPs\" back into print, which eventually raised enough money to reprint the whole book series. The drive was the most funded creative work in Kickstarter up to that point, getting more than twenty times the original goal for a total of $1,254,120. During the reprint drive Burlew committed, as rewards for meeting increasing funding goals, to write eight new short stories either about specific characters or in alternative non-canon settings; the characters for three of these stories were chosen by backers as part of the pledge reward.\n\nIn partnership with APE Games, Giant in the Playground released the first \"OOTS\" game, \"The Order of the Stick Adventure Game: The Dungeon of Dorukan\". The game, which was released in September 2006, utilizes cards and a board, and has strong influences from games such as \"Talisman\" and \"Dungeon!\", as well as the less-known \"Kings & Things\".\n\n\"The Dungeon of Dorukan\" is designed for 2–6 people, aged twelve and older. Each player controls one member of the OOTS team to explore the dungeon and hunt down Xykon. The player is able to train their chosen member with a variety of shtick cards. Each character provides a different gaming experience, and the players have the ability to either aid or harm their teammates.\n\nThe game has received two expansion sets. The first one, \"The Shortening\", released in 2011 by APE Games, included new cards and rules to reduce the duration of the game. The second 20 card mini-expansion, \"Sticky Shticks\", was announced as a pledge reward for the 2012 \"reprint drive\" Kickstarter campaign. It features cards that can be stuck to characters giving them some penalties.\n\nA second, stand-alone game, The Order of the Stick Adventure Game: The Linear Guild, was set to be released by APE Games in the Fall of 2008, but has not been released. Players would be able to take on the parts of Nale, Thog, Sabine, and other members of the Linear Guild in their own dungeon adventure, or they can combine the materials in the game with those from the Dungeon of Dorukan set for a massive Order of the Stick vs. Linear Guild head-to-head adventure.\n\n\n"}

Dedicated to his friend General Nikolay Raevsky, it was inspired by the poet's time spent in Pyatigorsk during his southern exile.\n\nThe poem is about a Byronic Russian officer who is disillusioned with elite life and decides to escape by seeking adventure in the Caucasus. He is captured by Circassian tribesmen but then saved by a beautiful Circassian woman. Despite its Romantic and Orientalist themes, Pushkin's use of academic footnotes and reliable ethnographic material gave it credibility in its day. It was highly influential on popular perceptions of the Caucasus for its time. The poem remains one of Pushkin's most famous works and is often referenced in Russian popular culture, in films such as the Soviet comedy \"Kidnapping, Caucasian Style\".\n\n\n\n"}

Regional variants include Hokkien \"tâng-ki\" 童乩 and Cantonese \"gei-tung\" 乩童 or \"san-daa\" 神打. \n\nA \"tongji\" or \"jitong\" is a person believed to have been chosen by a particular \"shen\" 神 \"god; spirit\" as the earthly vehicle for divine expression.

The person may attempt to resist that compulsion, but should their resistance fail, they will enter into a trance in which they may beat themselves with a nail-studded ball at the end of a cord and handle to the point that he draws blood from multiple wounds on his back.

It is home to over 70 galleries, museums and collections. It is roughly bounded by North 36th Street (US 27) (north), North 20th Street (south), I-95 (west) and Northeast First Avenue (east). It is one of the largest open-air street art installations in the world. \n\nThe Wynwood Art District Association was founded in early 2003 by a group of art dealers, artists and curators Mark Coetzee, Nina Arias and Nick Cindric. Mark Coetzee initiated the idea based on a similar project, Art Night, which he started in his hometown, Cape Town, South Africa. Founding members at the first meeting in Rocket Projects media room were Brook Dorsch of Dorsch Gallery, Weston Charles, Cooper and Elizabeth Withstandley of Locust Projects, Mark Coetzee of the Rubell Collection, Nina Arias and Nick Cindric of Rocket Projects, Bernice Steinbaum of Bernice Steinbaum Gallery, and Marina Kessler of Marina Kessler Gallery. The association created the Second Saturdays Gallery Walk, designed the Manhole cover logo along with the light banners that hang on street corners, and publishes annual brochures with a map and a list of the association's members. \n\nIt was once home to over 70 galleries, five museums, three collections, seven art complexes, 12 art studios, five art fairs and the Wynwood Walls. Gentrification and rising rent prices have pushed out most of the smaller galleries. In 2018, less than ten galleries remain.\n\nThe Wynwood Walls were created in 2009 by the late Tony Goldman in an effort to develop the area's pedestrian potential. Goldman bought his first building in Wynwood in 2004, and owned nearly two dozen properties by 2008. Artists from around the world have contributed to the Wynwood Walls. The Walls have been covered by media such as the \"New York Times\" and the BBC bringing international attention to the destination. It was also featured in the docu-series entitled \"Here Comes the Neighborhood\". The Walls have expanded to include murals outside the neighborhood, including Outside the Walls which features art covering entire buildings. In 2010, Goldman added the Wynwood Doors to highlight smaller artists. \"Curbed\" listed Wynwood Walls as among the 16 most Instagrammable places in US cities in 2018.\n\nEvery second Saturday of each month, a community-wide art walk is held. Galleries, art studios, alternative spaces and showrooms open their doors to the public for art, music and refreshments.\n\nCurator's Voice Art Projects\n"}
