Since 1998 it is part of the Austrian Service Abroad. AHMS representatives serve at major Holocaust memorial institutions in 23 countries worldwide. The German name is Gedenkdienst (Memorial Service). The organization is interested in roots and results of the Nazism and takes care of victims of Nazism. Women can participate since 2013.\n\nThe Political Scientist from Innsbruck and Scientific Director of the Braunauer Zeitgeschichte - Tage Andreas Maislinger on 10 October 1980 received on the invitation from Anton Pelinka the possibility to present his \"civilian service in Auschwitz\" in Dolores Bauer's ORF-broadcast \"Kreuzverhör\". Federal President Rudolf Kirchschläger declined his concept with the statement \"An Austrian has nothing to atone in Auschwitz\". Later Kirchschläger accredited the \"positive achievement\" of the \"accomplished holocaust memorial service\" of Andreas Maislinger.\n\n1980/81 Maislinger with Joachim Schlör was volunteer in the Poland seminar paper of the German Aktion Sühnezeichen Friedensdienst, which is led by Volker von Törne and Christoph Heubner. In the Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau he supervised the German juvenile group. After his return he was even more convinced to realize a similar programme in Austria. He was mainly supported by Simon Wiesenthal, Teddy Kollek, Ari Rath, Herbert Rosenkranz, Gerhard Röthler and Karl Pfeifer. One of Röthler's sons had accomplished Holocaust Memorial Service and Karl Pfeifer puplished an interview in the IKG-Newspaper \"Die GEMEINDE\".\n\nIn May 1991 Andreas Maislinger received a letter of the Minister of Interior Franz Löschnak. He was informed that the Holocaust Memorial Service was permitted by the Austrian Government to be an alternative to the civilian service. The needed funds were supported by the Federal Ministry of Interior until a defined frame.\n\n2001 under Minister of Interior Ernst Strasser a Service Abroad development association was established, which left the funds to independent sponsoring organizations, fore example the Austrian Service Abroad.\n\n\"As a former Polish political prisoner of a fascist Concentration Camp and historian of World War II, I want to take the honoring opportunity to speak in front of the high house. I want to thank all the young Austrians, which work so hard for the remembrance of the past. Here I specially think of the people. lf the documentation archive of the Austrian resistance under the leadership of Prof. Wolfgang Neugebauer, the Austrian Camp Community Mauthausen, the Holocaust Memorial Service, and also the local initiatives of the communities Gusen, Langenstein und St. Georgen in Oberösterreich, the working circle for homeland, memorial and history care.\" \n\n\"I thank you for the information about the positive result from you accomplished holocaust memorial service.\"\n\n\"The holocaust memorial service is a very impressive initiative.\" \n\n\"I feel very close to this organization and I have great respect for the servants, because what they achieve is the right way for Austria – to look the past directly into the eyes and to do something against it. Not to say, we were the first victims.\"\n\n\"I often claimed there is no Austrian association which sends young people to Israel, like the German organization “Aktion Sühnezeichen”. It touched me to read there is now, thanks to your affording the possibility to perform the Austrian civilian service within the framework of the Holocaust Memorial Service.\"\n\n\"I like to support and recommend the initiative Austrian Holocaust Service. It is a real service which can be and should be provided by young people.\"\n\n\"Many people have no idea what those young Austrians achieve for themselves, that they straight up their backbones, so they can walk straight again, also myself, who belongs to this generation.\" \n\n\"I consider the project Holocaust Memorial Service as an important and valuable initiative in the service of peace and the peoples' communication.\" \n\n\"Holocaust Memorial Service is remembrance work, which is also a bridge between “Yesterday's World” and the modern and democratic Austria. It also is a reminder that also nowadays values like sense of responsibility and moral courage did not lose their importance.\"\n\n\"Each Generation has to be aware of the horror of the past, to be able to build a new world of peace and respect for the human rights. The project Holocaust Memorial Service serves this important challenge of sensitization in sense of the words “Never forget.\" \n\n\"I follow the works of the Holocaust Memorial Service in great interest and the organization has my full support.\"\n\nWalter Gruggenberger (SPÖ), Andreas Hörtnagl (ÖVP) and Andreas Maislinger (independent) founded the association of the Holocaust Memorial Service in 1992. The association wanted to enhance Holocaust awareness, including its causes and consequences. The association is responsible for the assortment and care of social service volunteers before, during and after their service. The volunteers have the possibility to apply for one of the 20 partner organizations. In addition to that the role of the Austrians as offenders, victims and bystanders is very important. Also women have the possibility to provide a one-year-long holocaust memorial service as part of the European Voluntary Service (EVS). Female volunteers were sponsored for the first time in the year 2008 by the \"Geschwister-Mezei-Fond\", which was created with the goal to give women the possibility to accomplish the holocaust memorial service under the same conditions as civilian servants.\n\nThe association provides positions on all in all 19 memorial sites in Germany and Poland. It distinguishes itself from other organizations because of the relatively uncomplicated process of the assignment and because it generally isn’t as run over as other associations. The association \"Never Forget\" takes an active part in youth work against forgetting and is involved in the organization of the Hermann Langbein Symposium – Ideologie und Wirklichkeit des Nationalsozialismus (Hermann Langbein Symposium – ideology and reality of National Socialism), which is taking place since more than ten years for further training of teachers.\n\nAndreas Maislinger and Andreas Hörtnagl were deselected as presidents of the Holcoaust Memorial Service. In 1998, after long debates with the board of directors of the organization, they founded the organization \"Austrian Service Abroad\".\n\nThe Austrian Service Abroad is characterized due to its employees’ personal initiatives. It also holds the possibility for the volunteers to establish their own partner organization, which means a much bigger effort, but also more autonomy before their assignment. Therefore, a big network over four continents and all in all 37 countries has been established since 1998. Since 2009 this network is supported by an International Board under the presidency of Ernst Florian Winter.\n\nThe Austrian Service Abroad offers in addition to the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service, the Austrian Social Service and the Austrian Peace Service.\n\nThe main task of the volunteer is to give guided tours through the museum showing the 51-year period in the 20th century when Latvia was successively occupied by Nazi Germany and the USSR. Furthermore, the volunteer works in close cooperation with the Museum \"Jews in Latvia\". It was established to research, popularize and commemorate the history of Latvia's Jewish community. The museum's founder Margers Vestermanis was awarded the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Award in 2015 in honor for his work reviving Jewish culture in Latvia. The other volunteer's tasks are versatile like the translation of documents, the digitization of artifacts or the planning of temporary exhibits.\n\nAndreas Maislinger also initiated the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Award (AHMA), rewarding people who actively contribute to the remembrance of the Holocaust. On October 17, 2006 the Chinese historian Pan Guang was awarded the first AHMA prize. Further recipients were the Brazilian journalist Alberto Dines, French Robert Hébras, who was one of only six people, who survived the Massacre of Oradour and Lithuanian-American Holocaust survivor and co-founder of the Virginia Holocaust Museum Jay M. Ipson. In October 2010 Eva Marks was honored with the AHMA by Austrian Ambassador Hannes Porias in Melbourne.\n\nIn 2005 the founder of the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service Andreas Maislinger received the Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria in Silver from the president of Austria, Heinz Fischer, and the Medal of Merit of the state of Tirol from Herwig van Staa and Luis Durnwalder.\n\nOn November 8, 2009 Maislinger was awarded with a Lifetime Achievement Award for \"his 10 year fight to obtain official recognition of alternative, philanthropic service\" at the Annual Dinner of the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust together with Holocaust survivor and producer of \"Schindler's List\" Branko Lustig.\n\n\n"}

They are a kind of basket, woven and fitted to the shape of a foot. Bast shoes are an obsolete traditional footwear of the forest areas of Northern Europe, formerly worn by poorer members of the Finnic peoples, Balts,Russians and Belarussians. They were easy to manufacture, but not durable.\n\nBast shoes have been worn since prehistoric times. Wooden foot-shaped blocks (lasts) for shaping them have been found in neolithic excavations, e.g. 4900 years old. Bast shoes were still worn in the Russian countryside at the beginning of the twentieth century. Today bast shoes are sold as souvenirs and sometimes worn by ethnographic music or dance troupes as part of their costume.\nIn Russian, they are called lapti (\"лапти\", sing. \"лапоть\", lapot); this word is used as a derogatory term for cheap and short-lived footwear and, in the form \"lapotnik\" (\"лапотник\"), also for an uneducated person, notionally one who is too poor to afford good shoes and wears bast shoes instead. The MiG-105 \"Spiral\" spaceplane was nicknamed \"Lapot\" for the shape of its nose.\n\nBast shoes played an important role in the founding myth of Přemyslid dynasty, which reigned in Bohemia and Moravia until 1306 AD. Přemysl the Ploughman, its legendary ancestor, was a peasant of humble origin. His bast shoes and bast-bag were kept as relics at Vyšehrad and Czech kings put them on during their coronations. The relics probably were destroyed when Vyšehrad fell to Hussites in 1420.\n\n\n"}

He was educated in the public schools and attended Southwest Baptist University. His father, Landy Tunstall Lindsey, committed suicide when Ben was 18, leaving him the sole support of his mother and her three younger children. He obtained employment in a real-estate office in Denver, Colorado, where he studied law in his spare time. In despair over his slow progress in his law studies, he attempted suicide, but his gun misfired. In 1894, he entered the practice of law in Denver. In his work, he was often assisted by his wife, Henrietta, whom he had married in 1914. He was appointed to a vacancy in the county court in 1900.\n\nLindsey was a pioneer in the establishment of the juvenile court system. Through his efforts, an act was passed creating a juvenile court in Denver which represented an important advance in relation of the law to children and would go on to serve as a model for future juvenile courts across America. Lindsey was made judge of the juvenile court in 1901 (which became a juvenile and family relations court in 1907). He held the position continuously, but he was not endorsed by either political party in 1908. \n\nAmong other measures to which Judge Lindsey contributed his influence were a reform of the registration law, greatly reducing election frauds; a reform of the ballot; state provisions for the support of the dependents of people serving in prison; extension of the probation system for prisoners; organization of public baths and playgrounds in Denver; the institution of the fresh-air movement in Denver; and enactment of statewide Mother's Pension Law.\n\nHe was a leader in the movement to abolish child labor. He carried on an active propaganda for the general adoption of the juvenile court plan, and for political and social reform, through lectures delivered in many American and foreign cities and through the publication of books and pamphlets, of which \"The Beast\" (with Harvey J. O'Higgins, 1910) was widely circulated. In 1906, Judge Lindsey was a candidate for Governor of Colorado, and in 1912 became a member of the Progressive National Committee.\n\nIn early 1927, Judge Lindsey co-wrote a controversial book about what he called \"companionate marriage,\" in which he suggested that young men and women should be able to live together in a trial marriage, where the couple could have a year to evaluate whether or not they were suitable with each other. The only caveat was they had to agree not to have children. If after a year, the couple decided to stay together, they could do so, but if the relationship didn't work out, they would be able to dissolve the relationship easily. Also, if they decided they were compatible and did want children, they could change the status of their relationship to a traditionally understood marriage.\n\nSince one of the most common discourses in the popular culture was about women having children, and many clergy believed that sexual intercourse within marriage should only be for purposes of procreation, Judge Lindsey’s essay aroused strong emotions; a number of priests and ministers, as well as civic leaders accused him of promoting immorality, promiscuity and free love, charges that he denied. At one point, even the Pope spoke out against him. In Denver, he was ousted from the bench, after 28 years of service. \"Time\" expressed the view that his views on companionate marriage had destroyed his reputation. Judge Lindsey continued to defend his views on radio and in a series of speaking engagements.\n\nJudge Lindsey appeared as himself in the film \"The Soul of Youth\" (1920), directed by William Desmond Taylor, and in \"Judge Ben Lindsey in the Juvenile Court\" (1921), the latter film made in the experimental Photokinema sound-on-disc process.\n\nHe is referenced by fictional interpretation in the song \"Circle Round My Bedside\" by Jay Munly.\n\nIn 1931, he ran for, and won election to a judgeship in the California Superior Court. He also continued his advocacy for children in the juvenile justice system. He died in Los Angeles, California, of a heart attack, at age 73.\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

Such complications had already rendered him partially blind at the time of the film's release, only being able to see in shades of blue.\n\nThe film was his last testament as a film-maker, and consists of a single shot of saturated blue colour filling the screen, as background to a soundtrack where Jarman's and some of his long-time collaborators' narration describes his life and vision.\n\nBlue is split into two halves, each with differing narration. The first story, intercut with the second, tells the adventures of Blue, as a character and color. Blue is described as getting into fights with other colors, 'Yellowbelly scorches the earth with its accursed breath...', to adventures, 'Marco Polio stumbles across the blue mountains...'\n\nThe other story features the day-to-day life of Derek Jarman, as a gay man living in nineteen nineties London, and the complications of living with AIDS. Some of the events mentioned are realistic and true, such as visiting a café with friends, discussing the war in Sarajevo, and having difficulty with day-to-day life, such as putting clothes on backwards. Others feel more dreamlike, such as when Derek wonders what is beyond the sky. This contrasts with thoughts of his health and how long he has left until he dies, the weakening of his body, and eventual downfall of his eyesight.\n\nThere are also a handful of sections in which Derek daydreams. The narration makes mention of walking across the sky, and to wondering what an astronaut may be like.\n\nBlue's final moments consist of a set of names, being repeated. 'John. Daniel. Howard.

He is originally one of the main antagonists in \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" working for the Principality of Zeon, named after his late father Zeon Zum Deikun, with the honorary title of during Gundam's One Year War. Despite having opposed Earth Federation soldier Amuro Ray several times, in the sequel \"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam\" he becomes , an Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) pilot fighting alongside the series' main characters against the elitist Titans. In his final appearance in \"Char's Counterattack\", he assumes leadership of the Neo Zeon movement, and becomes the titular antagonist of the film.\n\nChar became one of Gundam's most iconic characters, often overshadowing Amuro's popularity. He also appeared as the most popular male anime character in \"Animage\"s Anime Grand Prix poll as well as in several other polls highlighting his popularity in the Gundam franchise. His role in the original has often been praised alongside his rivalry with Amuro.\n\nBorn Casval Rem Deikun, he is the elder brother of Sayla Mass (Artesia Som Deikun), and the son of late Zeon Zum Deikun, the champion of sovereignty for the space colonies of Side 3, founder of the Republic of Zeon. During the One Year War, Char shows great ability not only as a mobile suit pilot, but also as a tactician and a commanding officer.\n\nIt is eventually revealed that despite his high position and esteem, Char is secretly plotting revenge against the Zabi family for their role in the death of his father; who was a dignitary who spoke out for peace between spacenoids and earthlings and was subsequently assassinated. Char displays his first act of betrayal against the Zabi family by luring Garma's fleet into a flight path toward the Federation's \"White Base\"s line of sight. Prior to Garma's death at the hands of the \"White Base\", Char says to him, \"Garma, blame this on the misfortune of your birth.\" Later in the war, Char begins a bitter rivalry with Federation pilot Amuro Ray, and he develops a relationship with Lalah Sune, a Newtype girl he saved from a brothel. Char also develops into a Newtype himself, and forms psychic bonds with both Amuro and Lalah. Char's abilities and natural charisma allow him to inspire and manipulate. Lalah is killed in battle, taking a blow meant for Char; this results in a bitter hatred between Char and Amuro.\n\nDuring the war, Char draws on Zeon's philosophy to form his identity. The Zeon Principality is largely an authoritarian state that values independence from the Earth and later the destruction of Earth's inhabitants. With his devotion to free all of those who are \"trapped by gravity's pull\" he is able to face the most deadly outcomes with dignity and leadership.\n\nIn the Battle of A Baoa Qu, Char and Amuro's bitter rivalry reaches the level that they engage in a gunfight and then a sword fight after both lose their mobile suits. In the duel, Char realizes he has been distracted by his rivalry with Amuro, and refocuses on his true enemy - the Zabi family. An ensuing explosion knocks them apart, and Char rushes to save his sister. After being told by a dying Zeon soldier that Kycilia Zabi, the last surviving Zabi, is about to leave, he finds Kycilia's departing ship and kills her. He then disappears amidst the explosion and is logically presumed dead.\n\nStill presumed dead, Char reappears 8 years later in \"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam\". Having left Axis Zeon, Char returns to the Earth Sphere in September 0084 and infiltrates the Earth Federation Forces ranking with the alias \"Quattro Bajeena\". Almost immediately, he finds himself involved in conflicts against the Earth Federation's newly formed Titan Task Force, fighting and shooting down two enemy warships within hours of acquiring his new identity. After meeting the Federation politician Commodore Blex Forer, Char joins a group of former Earth Federation Forces soldiers and eventually becomes a leading member of the Anti-Earth Union Group.\n\nThis time, rather than serving as the rival of the new protagonist, Kamille Bidan, Char serves as Kamille's mentor in the war against the Earth Federation's oppressive Titans organization. In Zeta Gundam, Char becomes an ally of his former adversaries in Mobile Suit Gundam: Amuro Ray, Hayato Kobayashi and Bright Noa. He serves under Bright Noa as leader of AEUG mobile suit forces.\n\nDuring this period, Char loses faith in himself as a decision maker. It seems to be his greatest fear, as he normally displays none in regard to war. When assuming the identity of Quattro he willingly places himself under the command of his former enemies. He has discovered that there can be compromise in the future of Earth's population and the colonies. In the course of \"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam\" even Bright Noa, who lost crew to Char's attacks on the White Base, urges him to drop the Quattro facade and become a leader to the Spacenoids, or those raised in space colonies. \"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam\" portrays Char's image as a hero who is always willing to stand up and fight for the freedom of spacenoids. His political speech in front of Federation Assembly in Dakar, which is broadcast throughout Earth and Space, is one of the most important events in the U.C. Gundam timeline. It seals Char's total commitment toward space colonization and migration of humanity to space.\n\nDespite AEUG's victory in the Gryps Conflict against the Titans, Char is defeated in the final battle by Haman Karn, leader of the Axis Zeon (later Neo Zeon) faction and assumed dead. However, as the final credits roll, Char's damaged mobile suit floats by with its cockpit hatch open.\n\nChar returns in the movie \"\", set five years later, as the leader of a new Neo Zeon faction. He intends to create a nuclear winter by dropping the massive asteroid base Axis on the Earth, hence forcing a complete migration into space, which he believes will make all of humanity evolve into Newtypes. Only one thing stands in his way: the Federation's Londo Bell task force, and their top ace pilot, his old archrival Amuro Ray.\n\nIn the second Neo Zeon movement, both Char and Amuro pilot mobile suits equipped with an advanced psycommu system known as psycoframe. Char authorized Anaheim Electronics to pass the psycoframe technology to the development team responsible for Amuro's Nu Gundam, effectively planning a fair showdown between them in advance. After Char's mobile suit is destroyed by Amuro in the duel, Amuro captures Char's escape pod, and against Char's taunting, attempts to push the asteroid Axis away from Earth. The intense willpower of Amuro and all the pilots assisting him causes Nu Gundam's psycoframes to resonate and overload, resulting in a spectacular aurora with Axis pushed out of Earth's orbit. Both Amuro and Char disappear without a trace in the incident. There is no concrete evidence about them being deceased in the movie although Nanai Miguel did claim that Char's life force was fading away, as Amuro intercepted Axis and cries for Char when Axis is finally pushed back. The fates of either character were never revealed in the film, though the novelization of \"Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack\" confirms both as KIA. The follow-up Gundam Unicorn also supports this idea. However, in the official Universal Century timeline for the animated series, it lists Amuro Ray and Char Aznable as MIA.\n\nAccording to the manga \"Mobile Suit Gundam The Origin\", young Casval and his sister Artesia escape to Earth shortly after their father's death with the help of family friend Jimba Ral (father of Ramba Ral). They spend several years living a luxurious life under the guardianship of the aristocratic Don Teabolo Mass, who names them Edward and Sayla, and treats them like his own children. During this time, Jimba Ral constantly reminds Casval of the Zabi Family's betrayal of his father. After narrowly escaping an attempt on their lives (in which Jimba Ral dies), they flee to the Texas Colony.\n\nThey live for a time in a house set up by Texas Colony's chief manager Roger Aznable, still under Teabolo Mass's care. They meet Roger's son Char and discover that he and Casval are nearly identical, except Casval's eyes are blue while Char's are brown. Eventually Char is taken in by Gihren Zabi's propaganda, and against his father's wishes sets off for officer training school. Casval decides to accompany him under the guise of looking out for his friend. Kycilia Zabi finds out that Casval is headed back to Side 3, and without consulting Gihren, orders Casval's death. Both near-identical boys are booked to leave on the same flight, but an antique pistol and fake explosives are found in Char's bag. Not wanting to miss the entrance exam, Char accepts Casval's suggestion to swap clothes in the restroom. Char boards the ship under the name Edward Mass, while Casval, under the name Char Aznable is detained overnight. Shortly after departure, the ship explodes and kills everyone aboard (no doubt the work of Kycilia's henchmen). Edward Mass is listed among the dead and Casval takes on the name Char, enters the Zeon Military Academy and begins wearing sunglasses to hide his eye color (as it wouldn't match any of the real Char's IDs).\n\nAfter entering the Academy, Char excels in his training and befriends Garma Zabi. As relations between the Zeon Republic (which has been renamed the Principality of Zeon) and the Federation deteriorate, the Federation increases their troop strength in Side 3. There is widespread fear that this troop increase is in fact an invasion and occupation force. On the eve of troop increase, Casval incites Garma to lead other students in the Academy to storm the Federation base and subdue the stationed troops. For this action Casval is stripped of his rank and expelled from the Academy. He travels to Earth and works at the construction site of Federation headquarters in Jaburo. After hostility breaks out between Zeon and the Federation, he returns to Side 3 and joins the Zeon mobile suit assault forces under the command of Admiral Dozle Zabi. He displays superior fighting ability during the Battle of Loum, single-handedly destroying five Federation \"Magellan\"-class battleships, which earned him the nickname \"Red Comet\". He was promoted an exceptional two ranks to Lieutenant Commander.\n\nAt the end of the One Year War, Char goes to Axis and his experience there is partly depicted in the manga \"Char's Deleted Affair\", where he heroically protects Axis in two major battles against the Earth Federation. He stays there until the end of U.C. 0082, when he gets back to Side 3 for a special mission to protect Haman Karn's inspection journey of Side 3. When they arrive at Zum City in U.C. 0083, he gets an invitation by George Miguel (Brother of Nanai) to join a paramilitary spacenoid organization within the Earth Federation Force.\n\nHowever, upon hearing of Maharaja Karn's fatal illness in late May 0083, Char and Haman both decide to return to Axis. Once they do, they're intercepted by the pro-war Axis faction that wishes to restart the conflict with the Earth Federation, led by one Colonel Enzo. A civil war breaks out, with Char and Haman eventually overcoming Enzo's forces. Unfortunately, Mahajara Karn - Haman's father and the true political leader of Axis' - dies just shortly before the battle ends, and Haman now finds herself in charge of both Axis and Mineva. Tension between Char and Haman over the future of Axis and Zeon lead Char to finally leave the asteroid permanently with over 600 other soldiers on October 29, 0083.\n\nChar favors speed-orientated offensive battle tactics and hates to get hit, even when piloting an I-Field generator equipped unit and beam attacks have minimal to no effect (Commented when piloting Zero the R in a simulation battle in \"Portrait of a Young Comet - Char's Deleted Affair\").\n\nHe typically pilots red mobile suits, such as his red MS-06S Zaku II, Z'Gok, Gelgoog, RMS-009 Rick Dias and Sazabi. Exceptions to this is the MSN-02 Zeong, which was painted in a bluish-grey colour during the Battle of A Baoa Qu, and had no time to even install the legs, much less be repainted and the MSN-00100 Hyaku Shiki, which is painted in bright gold yellow (At the time, he was operating under another assumed identity).\n\nThe name \"Char Aznable\" was inspired by Armenian-French singer and songwriter and a character named Charkin in an earlier robot anime Reideen (ライディーン)\n\nChar Aznable is not only a character, but has become a brand name. Char, along with five other notable mecha and pilots from the various Gundam series, were recognized in the second set of \"Anime Heroes and Heroines\" stamps, released in Japan in 2005. Char Aznable has routinely placed in the top 10 lists of popular characters in both Gundam-specific and general-oriented fan magazines in Japan, such as \"Gundam Ace\" and \"Animage\", typically ranking higher than the main character and his rival, Amuro Ray. In \"Gundam Ace\", Char is consistently in the top 3 of the list, and held the number 1 spot for long periods of time, despite the fact that \"Gundam Ace\" tallies votes for Char's alter-ego Quattro Bajeerna separately. In fact, Quattro also consistently ranks in the top 10. In both Gunpla and Figure magazines it is almost guaranteed to see Char's custom red mobile suit. He has also been voted as the second most popular male character from the 1980s by \"Newtype\" readers. During January from 2007, Oricon made a poll in which they asked Japanese fans from manga and anime which characters from any series they would most like to see in spinoff series. He won the men's poll while ranked second in the overall. In a NHK poll from 2018 he was voted as the best \"Gundam\" character.\n\nOn the Japanese bulletin board 2channel, the Gundam forums are named \"Char custom\" (シャア専用), and the anonymous placeholder for the name is changed to \"3 times more than the usual anonymous\" (通常の名無しさんの３倍), a reference to the \"3 times faster than the usual Zaku\" line from the original series. \"Char Custom\" refers to Char's tendency to highly customized standard Mobile Suits to his exact specifications and generally making the said units far more potent than normal. This usually involves the character coloring his suits red, which led some people to go as far as to label anything red \"Char-custom\", and to make vague references to the \"3 times more potent\" line in the original Gundam series (e.g. A red pencil might write 3 times faster, or is 3 times more likely to break). This pinkish-red colour is actually not the idea of the director, but only because the excess pinkish red colour ink the animation company has at the time. It is, however, stated in the game Gireh's Greed that the colour is actually only the colour of an unpainted Zaku due to the grudge from him being the top graduate from military school.\n\nBandai has capitalized on the character's popularity by licensing out the name to various products. There has been a Char-custom laptop, Char-custom Nintendo Gamecube, and a Char-custom motorbike helmet. All these products have a red satin finish, and have the goldleaf Zeon insignia or the emblem of Char's Neo Zeon emblazoned on them. A Char-custom Game Boy Advance SP was also created in Japan (with many sources claiming its battery will last 3 times as long as the normal GBA, or even that it will crash 3 times as much). On July 25, 2006, GE Consumer Finance released a Char Custom credit card, which receives three times as many bonus points per 1000 yen spent compared to their other Gundam-related credit cards . Japanese cell phone company Soft Bank released a special Char Custom cell phone in late 2007, with a very large red Zaku head which serves as the charger base. Char related apparel and accessories span a wide range, from the ubiquitous Quattro sunglasses to Char lighters, neckties, wristbands, caps, wallets and a wide range of T-shirts. The creator of Char Aznable, Yoshiyuki Tomino, does not like the idea of making money this way. He feels that by sticking the term \"Char's Custom\" to the products culturally suggests the quality of the product is superior to other brands. However, most of them are only coloured red and are basically the same as the products on which they are based; ironically, some of these \"Char Custom\" products are even of lower quality than the baseline products. Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino believes that \"having satisfication in such products just because they are popular and can earn money is a sin, since it cannot teach a correct social sense to the newer generation\".\n\nIn a planned spaceflight for 2006, Soyuz TMA-9, a Japanese internet investor named Daisuke Enomoto had asked to dress up as Char Aznable. However, medical restrictions prevented him from participating in the flight. Toyota also formed a new branch called Zeonic Toyota planning to issue a series of special cars, the first one being Char Aznable special Auris.\n\nAlthough his duel with Amuro in the film was considered the highlight of the film, Allen Divers from Anime News Network criticized how unfulfilled was their rivalry. THEM Anime Reviews' Carlo Ross saw Char in the film as the \"true star\" believing him to overshadow Amuro. On the other hand, J. Doyle Wallis criticized their rivalry in the film considering it a \"rehash\" of the events of the television series.\n\n"}

{"id": "42946860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42946860", "title": "Cultural views on the navel", "text": "Cultural views on the navel\n\nThe navel has been historically subject to many customs, fashions and taboos. Various cultures view the sexual and cultural significance of the navel differently, and these views have changed over time, which has shaped social mores relating to the navel in design of clothing and social traditions and practices.\n\nThe public exposure of the male and female midriff and bare navel has been taboo at times in Western cultures, being considered immodest or indecent. It was banned in some jurisdictions, with some arguing that it simulated an \"erogenic orifice\". Eventually, only female navel exposure was banned and not male because, it was argued, the simulation or upward displacement from vagina to navel was commonplace and obvious in women.\n\nCommunity perceptions have changed and exposure of female midriff and navel is more accepted today and in some societies or contexts it is both fashionable and common, though not without its critics. The exposure of the male navel has not been as controversial nor as common, and is usually in the context of barechestedness. Exposure of the navel by females is commonly associated with the popularization of the bikini, of the crop top and low-rise clothing.\n\nIn the United States, the Motion Picture Production Code, or Hays Code, enforced after 1934, banned the exposure of female navel in Hollywood films. The National Legion of Decency, a Roman Catholic body guarding over American media content, also pressured Hollywood to keep clothing that exposed certain parts of the female body, such as bikinis and low-cut dresses, from being featured in Hollywood movies.\nDuring the 1950s, Joan Collins was prohibited by the censors from exposing her navel in \"Land of the Pharaohs\" (1955). To get around the censors' guidelines, she wore a jewel, a ruby, in her navel. This technique of baring the midriff but gluing a jewel on the navel was used in many other Hollywood films featuring belly dance sequences. Kim Novak wore a ruby in her navel for the film \"Jeanne Eagels\" (1957); saying in an interview, \"they had to glue it in every time. I got a terrible infection from it.\" Marilyn Monroe, for a scene from \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959), wore a dress that revealed skin everywhere but had a tiny piece of fabric to hide her navel. (The film was condemned by the National Legion of Decency, but for other reasons.)\n\nBy the 1960s, community standards had changed. Marilyn Monroe was allowed to expose her navel in \"Something's Got to Give\" (1962) and later commented, \"I guess the censors are willing to recognize that everybody has a navel.\" Ursula Andress, appearing as Honey Rider in the 1962 James Bond film, \"Dr. No\", wore her iconic white bikini, which exposed her midriff and navel. However, when Annette Funicello was cast in her first beach movie \"Beach Party\" (1963), Walt Disney, who held her contract, insisted that she only wear modest bathing suits and keep her navel covered, to preserve her wholesome persona, though she was the only one of the ample number of young women in the film not bikini-clad. In the 1967 film \"Follow That Camel\", actress Anita Harris wore a jewel on her navel for a belly dance sequence.\n\nThe Hays Code was abandoned soon after, and with it the prohibition of female navel exposure, as well as other restrictions. The influence of the National Legion of Decency had also waned by the 1960s. With the withdrawal of the Code and the change to a classification regime, the ban on the exposure of parts of the human body that had previously been regarded as immodest or indecent was withdrawn; and with it there was an increasing level of body exposure over time. The exposure of the navel ceased to be controversial in the context of a general increase in nudity.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, Disney's heroines began exposing more skin as well. In the 1989 animated film \"The Little Mermaid\", the animated lead protagonist, Ariel, flashed her navel while wearing only fins and seashells, a first in Disney's history.\n\nIn 1951, the United States Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters came into force, which, besides other things, prohibited female navel exposure on US television. During the 1960s, Barbara Eden was not allowed to show her navel on the US TV show \"I Dream of Jeannie\" (1965–70). Her pants had to be worn above the navel, which became ineffective. After a few frames of her navel exposure went unnoticed, they decided to use fabric and skin-colored make-up to cover her navel. Her costume became low rise (with no censorship) in 1985 and In 2013, Barbara Eden attended the Life Ball event in Vienna dressed in the same costume of \"I Dream of Jeannie\" but flaunting her navel. In February 1964, Scandinavian Airlines placed an advertisement in newspapers and magazines throughout America. It featured a bikini-clad blonde model exposing her bellybutton posing on a rock above the caption \"What to show your wife in Scandinavia\". The image that appeared in most publications had the belly button removed.\nThe first exposure of a navel in a TV series occurred in 1961 on the \"Dr. Kildare\" series. Dawn Wells and Tina Louise were not allowed to expose their navels in \"Gilligan's Island\" (1964–67). Wells was required to wear high-waisted shorts that covered her navel.\nWells stated in an interview, \"Oh my goodness, I designed the shorts. Because it was the first short shorts ever on television and it had to cover my navel. \"Gilligan's Island\" actually gave censors headaches back in the '60s. Ginger's cleavage, and Mary Ann's navel were only allowed 3 seconds an episode.\" The censors missed Nichelle Nichols showing her navel in the second-season \"\" episode \"\" (1967). It is believed that it was due to Bjo Trimble that it went unnoticed. Another episode of \"Star Trek\", called \"A Private Little War\" (1968), also managed to get past the censors when Nancy Kovack's belly button was clearly visible in some shots and not covered by jewelry as seen when the fringe from her top was not covering it. In 1969, Mariette Hartley was not allowed to show her belly button in \"\" (1969), the penultimate episode of Gene Roddenberry's \"Star Trek\". Gene had Mariette expose not one but two belly buttons in the sci-fi film \"Genesis II\" (1973).\n\nIn \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\" (1971–74), network censors feared Cher's navel exposure would become a cause célèbre at CBS. Cher once commented, \"There were so many things that were censored—ideas and words. All I know is I got in trouble for showing my belly button, and every time I turned around after I went off the air, all you saw were Cheryl Ladd's boobs.\" \"People\" magazine dubbed Cher \"Pioneer of the Belly Beautiful\".\n\nThe American code of practice was suspended in 1983.\n\nNavel exposure became common in the culture of 20th-century music, starting in the 1980s, with many famous female pop stars having appeared on and offstage and in music videos with their midriff exposed, usually wearing a crop top, including Madonna, during 1983, she caused controversy when she wore a mesh crop top in her video for the song \"Lucky Star\". \"People\" magazine wrote that Madonna made the bare navel her trademark.\n\nActress Cher sported an Indian princess outfit with feathers and beads around her navel for the Academy Awards ceremony in 1986. California designer Christine Albers commented, \"the look is good for anyone who has a great body but especially for women who do a lot of stomach exercises.\"\n\nPaula Abdul's bellybutton was exposed in a fishnet see-through dress in the 1989 music video for \"Cold Hearted\" and she appeared with a tattooed navel in the music video for \"My Love Is for Real\" in 1995.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Canadian country singer Shania Twain appeared in low jeans baring her midriff and navel in her music videos and performances. It became both the most widely discussed body part in country music and her trademark. Shania once commented, \"Someone said to me once, 'Well, if I had your belly-button I'd sell 8 million albums too.' But it takes a lot more than a belly-button to sell more than 8 million albums.\" Jennifer Lopez is believed to have started the trend of exposing the navel on stage and red carpets. It has been said Christina Aguilera has the most recognizable belly button in history. \"People\" magazine stated, \"The 19-year-old hotshot chanteuse behind 'What a Girl Wants', once a Mouseketeer alongside Britney Spears, can't quite pull off pop star flash without belly-flopping.\"\nIn 2001, the editors of \"Britannica\" commissioned an article on Britney Spears that deconstructs her bare midriff. The article describes Miss Spears's navel as \"a heated boundary between baby and babe\". She had been a major inspiration for the navel piercing trend. \"Spin\" magazine chose Madonna's navel as its \"most incredible\" rock star body part for a September 2005 feature. Gregorio Luke, former director of the Museum of Latin American Art who conducted lectures about belly buttons, said, \"The belly button has been a sign of beauty in goddesses as different as Astarte, Venus or Aphrodite. We ask which is more beautiful, the perfectly round belly button of Jane Fonda or Raquel Welch's grain of coffee navel? Every star from Madonna to Shakira proudly displays their belly button.\"\n\nOn the contrary, American columnist Kathleen Parker in an article about Katharine Hepburn once commented, \"Young movie-going girls today don't have access to many in the mold of Katharine Hepburn. Instead by mall observations most are Britney wannabes—hip-hugged, tattooed, pierced and out there. The female navel has become the refrigerator man's continental divide. I hate to break it to you, oh future daughters-in-law, but everybody's got a belly button. Your inney- or outey-ness is not the stuff either of revelation or revolution.\"\n\nExposed midriff is associated with the crop top, often in association with low-rise clothing. Another way that the navel may be exposed is via a deep plunging neckline dress or top that drops below the natural waist line.\nLow-rise clothing started in the early 1990s, when the British magazine \"The Face\" featured Kate Moss in low-rise jeans on its March 1993 issue cover. Models such as Gisele Bündchen frequently flash their midriffs. In 1994, Art Cooper, editor-in-chief of \"GQ\" magazine said that his big seller in 1994 was the February issue with Geena Davis on the cover, on which she wore an Armani suit opened at the hips to reveal her navel, It sold about 400,000 copies. He stated, \"Part of the success is the navel factor. I think the belly button is really an erogenous zone.\"\n\nNavel piercing and navel tattoos has become more common among young women. The trend of piercing or tattooing the navel became popular in the 1990s. It is popular among middle-aged women. Actress Drew Barrymore has a butterfly tattoo beneath her navel. The growing popularity of belly dancing, where navel exposure is typical, has also added to the navel exposure trend.\n\nContrarily, advice columnist Ann Landers commented, \"Navels are neither sexy nor obscene. I do not believe any female of good taste would wear an outfit where her navel shows. This does not include women in costumes or those on beaches in bikinis. The same goes for males. An adult male who wears hip-huggers so low rates zero minus 10 on the scale of taste—it's my opinion but it's one I feel strongly about.\" Fashion historian James Laver told that he hasn't quite caught up with the idea of exposing the navel, saying, \"I have never regarded that as a particularly attractive part of the human anatomy\". The navel fashion returned in the 1980s, when a New York City ban on exposing the navel in public was lifted.\n\nThe importance of the navel is such that for Czech model Karolína Kurková, who does not have a navel, the magazine and catalogue art directors routinely airbrush one in for her during post-production. They keep a collection of belly button shots in different positions, and Photoshop them on to her whenever she's doing a bikini picture. Kelly Ripa has also appeared in magazine covers of Shape with morphed navels.\n\nSince 2010, the crop top evolved by which women started wearing it with a high-rise skirts, jeans, or shorts that are high enough to cover the belly button. The bandeau top also made an appearance in formal wear, usually associated with a high-rise skirt or pants that cover the navel. Actress Halle Berry wore a bandeau with matching pants to the MTV Video Music Award, fueling the trend of wearing a bandeau top as an out-of-home dress. Miley Cyrus also wore a bandeau top with cropped high waisted pants at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and Jourdan Dunn wore a bandeau top with a long skirt.\n\nDisplays of the female navel commenced with the introduction of the bikini in 1946, designed by Louis Réard, though two-piece swimsuits that exposed the midriff but covered the navel appeared in the 1930s. Réard could not find a model who would dare wear his brief design, so he hired Micheline Bernardini, a 19-year old nude dancer from the Casino de Paris, as his model. The uptake of the new-style swimsuit was very slow, and even then the bikini was not regarded as suitable clothing beyond the beach or pool. During the 1960s, Mary Quant's designs featured exposed navels and bare midriffs.\nExposure of the male navel was limited well into the 1960s. The swimwear covered the lower abdomen and usually the navel. Occasionally the swimwear would be worn immediately below the navel. The swimwear evolved to longer legs and lower waist line. Male swimwear could not be worn above the navel nor below the knee in events of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\n\nBikinis have become a major component of marketing various women's sports, and most female athletes often wear a sports bikini that exposes the navel as the professional attire. Bulgarian athlete Ivet Lalova is known for her \"tribal sun\" tattoo around her navel. Croatian athlete Blanka Vlašić is famous for her navel piercing.\n\nThe fashion later became increasingly popular through sporting styles tops comprising modified sports bras without additional outer garments, sports bikinis, and cheerleading style fashions developing largely from the styles originating with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders in the early 1970s.\n\nFemale tennis players are known for exposing their navels or navel piercings on court. American tennis player Serena Williams was noted by the media for exposing her navel piercing during her matches.\nSimilarly, retired Russian tennis player Anna Kournikova was known for frequent navel exposure during her matches. In 2009, for an interview to the German magazine\n\"Der Spiegel\" when asked about her belly button showing during serves, she commented, \"These are men's ravings.Why you should hide it, when it isn't necessary? Female beach volley ball players play in bikinis - does it bother anyone?\"\nAmerican female golfer Laura Diaz commenting to the Ladies Professional Golf Association for \"Sports Illustrated\", \"The LPGA needs to acknowledge that a lot of people watch women's sports more for the women than for the sports. Why else would Anna Kournikova, who has never won a singles title, be the most popular player in women's tennis? We have quite a few attractive women, and we should use our looks to our advantage. After all, what's so wrong with seeing an occasional belly button?\"\n\nMales often wear no shirt with lower rise shorts during practice. This was somewhat upheld during practice of American football, which was carried over to wearing cropped jerseys during 1980s telecasts. Cropped jerseys became dormant for 20 years until male athletes returned to midriff exposure for comfort purposes. However, the NCAA has placed an official ban on navel exposure. The National Football League has long placed a ban on navel exposure (It has since required jerseys to be tucked in.) and banned Elliott's crop top in September 2016.\n\nThe navel is mentioned as an important element of a woman's beauty in the Song of Songs of the Hebrew Bible. It contains imagery similar to that in the love songs of ancient Egyptian literature. Song of Songs 7:2 states, \"Your navel is a rounded bowl.\" The verse preceding the line mentioning the navel (Song of Songs 7:1) states, \"your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand\", ) and the verse following states, \"Your belly is a heap of wheat.\" Thus, the description of the navel is placed textually in between the description of the curves of a woman through thigh and the stomach or midriff. \"Belly\" also suggests the womb, and the combination of the imagery of the womb with that of wheat suggests the link between eroticism and fertility through the imagery of the navel and curvaceous thighs. These passages also celebrate a curvaceous stomach and midriff and plumpness as aspects of female physical attractiveness.\n\nIn the ancient Mediterranean, Hebrew, Israelite and Middle Eastern worldview, it was a common belief that shrines, important places such as cities or capitals, or other such places of prominence had a position of centrality to the world and hence equated to the child-bearing, life-giving navel of a mother. These domains constituted what could be regarded as important bond that linked the universe. Thus Nippur, the ancient city of the Mesopotamian people, was often described as the \"navel\". This suggested to the prominence of the location and the way it was seen to function as a place of centrality and as a link between earth and the heavens and the Universe. The Greeks thought that the conical stone \"Omphalos\" (\"navel\") located at Delphi was the center of the earth.\n\nIn a similar vein, in the Jewish \"Midrashim\" it is stated, \"God created the world like an embryo. Just as the embryo begins at the navel and continues to grow from that point, so too the world. The Holy One, blessed be he, began the world from its navel. From there it was stretched hither and yon. Where is its navel? Jerusalem. And its (Jerusalem's) navel itself? The altar.\" This passage describes how the centrality of the ancient city of Jerusalem and of the altar of the ancient temple of Jerusalem within cosmic framework was equated to the navel of a mother and the source of life. This is also seen in the Book of Jubilees 8:19 and Book of Enoch 26:1 where it is describes Mount Zion as \"The center of the navel of the earth\". In Samaritan tradition Mount Gerizim is described as the navel of the earth, the only place that was not submerged in the deluge of the story of Noah's Ark. The phrase \"navel of the earth\" is used in (Ezek 38:12; Judg 9:37) Aramaic \"tibbur\" (\"navel\") and is also mentioned in Ezek 16:4. According to Samaritan tradition, Adam was made from the dust of Mount Gerizim. The navel is also celebrated in the belly dancing tradition of Mediterranean, and middle eastern cultures. When Pope Urban II called for the First Crusade, he referred to Jerusalem as \"the navel of the world\".\n\nIn Egypt, dancing in public with an uncovered navel is illegal, so many dancers wear a body stocking or netting to cover their skin. An Egyptian girl named Rubi upset members of parliament and the TV authority enough to institute a ban on music videos when a woman's navel appears.\n\nWhile the West was relatively resistant to midriff-baring clothing until the 1980s, it has long been a fashion with Indian women. These women, especially those from Southern India, have traditionally worn saris that bare the midriff. Women from Rajasthan leave the midriff exposed while wearing Ghagra Cholis. These women often cover their heads with \"dupattas\", and may cover their faces in front of strangers with \"ghoonghats\". There is a belief in India that navel-baring has a symbolic, almost mystical, association with birth and life, and that the display is meant to emphasize the centrality of nature in the nurture role. In ancient Indian tradition, the navel of the god Vishnu is considered to be the center of the universe and the source of life. From his navel a new world emerges. This has been depicted in many ancient Indian sculptures as a lotus emerging from the navel on which god Brahma is seated.\n\nAlthough women in ancient India wore saris that bared the midriff, the \"Dharmasastra\" writers stated that women should be dressed such that the navel was never visible, and navel exposure became taboo. The trend of exposing the navel was started by women who were dancers, acrobats, or entertainers, and who developed a technique of wearing the sari like a pair of trousers well below the navel to assist in the free movement of the legs. Women in this type of attire are very common in many ancient Indian sculptures, and paintings.\n\nIndian sculpture emphasised the centrality and sexuality that emanated from the depiction of the woman's navel. One of the most stunning examples would be Didarganj Yakshi, a statue of a woman made during the Mauryan period. Carved out of sandstone, which gives it a natural shine where the navel is deeply embedded within the centre of the torso, drawing the focus of the viewer. Before sculpting, the sculptors created an image and indicated the six structural centers, of which the navel is one, as defined by Yoga principles. Technically, the typical female representation in ancient Indian art includes an hourglass figure with large hips, breasts, and buttocks, and a deep navel. According to Indian physiognomy, if a woman's navel is deep, she is popular and loved by her husband. A broad, fleshy, shallow navel indicates a lucky woman. A woman with deep navel with a whirl to the right side is considered auspicious and is expected to lead a comfortable life. Famous Indian painter M. F. Husain once commented, \"The belly button has always been in. It has been an intrinsic part of the Indian woman. It has been part of Indian sculptures that go back so many centuries. That is why so many years ago, even in the 50s, all my works had women show their belly buttons.\"\n\nWith their migration to different countries, many Indian women began to wear the normal sari below the waistline, exposing the navel in a style known as a low-rise or low hip sari. The trend started during the 1950s, when saris were worn below the navel, with big pleats that were tightly draped across the curves of the body. Due to liberalization and changing global markets, saris are re-emerging as erotic apparel. As a result, saris began to be designed in innovative ways using different materials, such as transparent and semi-transparent saris made of sheer fabrics like chiffon. These modern saris may be draped in different ways, such as a petticoat being tied about below the navel, just above the pubic area, and a small blouse ending just below the breasts with a thin \"pallu\" exposing some part of the blouse and almost the entire midriff. In September 2012, \"The New York Times\" featured a wedding announcement with an image of a woman of Indian heritage displaying her navel in a \"gagra choli\" for the first time. This style was popularised by Bollywood celebrities and other popular regional film industries, such as Tamil and Telugu cinema. \nIn ancient Indian tradition, the navel of Lord Vishnu is considered to be the source of life and creativity. There's almost some sort of fascination with the navel in India, because it is considered to be a symbol of birth and life. That means in ancient India, women would wear sari that bared their midriffs. \n\nIndian television actors have followed suit, wearing saris that expose more skin, including the navel, with viewers mimicking the styles.\n\nSome women wear navel jewels or navel piercings to emphasize the navel and enhance its appeal. Another option is using \"bindis\" to decorate the navel. Tattoos near or below the navel were becoming popular in cities such as Pune in early 2012. Actresses Mandira Bedi and Chhavi Mittal are known for their unique tattoos on their navels.\n\nSometimes the low-rise style is modified, with the navel being covered by the pallu when wearing a low-rise non-transparent sari. In some corporations in India, saris are required to be worn in a manner that avoids navel exposure. Anita Gupta, Senior Vice-President at J. Walter Thompson in Chennai commented that formal wear for woman should not expose the navel.\n\nIndian actresses have expressed comfort with the practice of exposing their navels in film, preferring it to showing cleavage and calling it uncontroversial.\n\nSouth Indian actresses such as Silk Smitha, Simran, Kiran Rathod, Namitha, Trisha Krishnan, Anushka Shetty, Shriya Saran, Ileana D'Cruz, Kajal Aggarwal, Mumtaj, Taapsee Pannu, Shruti Hassan, Tamannaah, Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Nayanthara, Shwetha Menon, etc., are known for their navel exposure. Actresses such as Ileana D'Cruz, Tamannaah, Shriya Saran etc., are known for exposing their slim midriffs in song sequences.\n\nDuring the 1990s, scenes focusing on the female protagonist's navel were common in Tamil cinema. Actress Sukanya became famous for a scene in the 1992 film \"Chinna Gounder\", where the main protagonist spins a top on the female protagonist's navel. The 1993 film \"Gentleman\" featured a scene in the song sequence where female protagonist's navel is poked with a sword. In 1996, actress Nagma became known for acting in a food play scene in the Tamil film \"Love Birds\", which involves the male protagonist breaking an egg and cooking it on her navel, which was similar to a scene from \"Hot Shots!\" (1991) involving Valeria Golino. In the early 2000s Simran Bagga was known for her navel exposure in films. Her pierced navel also drew many youths to the cinema for the 2002 film \"Pammal K. Sambandam\".\nIn his review of \"Isai\" (2015), film critic Baradwaj Rangan stated that \"Sulagna brings to mind the heroines of a certain era who were chosen not because they had beautiful eyes or a bewitching smile but because of the quiver-quotient of their navel when confronted by a close-up.\" Film critic Sudhir Srinivasan wrote in a review for the 2016 film \"Aranmanai 2\", \"The emphasis is not so much on making a horror story that is novel, than it is on fixating on the heroine’s navel.\"\n\nOf the South Indian film industries, Telugu cinema more frequently has actresses expose their navels. Film scholar Mahesh Kathi commented that Telugu cinema has a long history of \"fondness for the navel\", citing old South Indian temple architecture, which features numerous prominent displays of navels in their carvings, and calling such displays a \"South Indian aesthetic sensibility\". He continued, \"Cinematically, while cleavage is just a peek at the bosom, the navel encompasses the woman's entire sensuality. \nThe 1978 film \"Maro Charitra\" was the first to feature the scene where a top spins on the female protagonist's navel. \n\nVeteran Telugu film director Kovelamudi Raghavendra Rao's movies always have guaranteed navel show of the heroines. He used to include the navel of the heroine in every possible frame and exploit it in song sequences such as dropping of water, flowers, fruits, ice cubes etc., on the navel. Prominent Telugu actor and director Dasari Narayana Rao had once commented, \"When you see a heroine slightly removing her pallu to show her inside assets, you don't feel ashamed of it because of the artistic way in which Ragahvendra Rao projects it on the screen. Especially heroines' navels look most beautiful in his movies.\" \nTelugu actor and politician Chiranjeevi had commented in a TV show, \"If you want to know about fruits, you have to do one film with director K. Raghavendra Rao. He used to put all the fruits around the heroine’s navel (boddu).\"\nIn 2016, actress Pragya Jaiswal had requested Raghavendra Rao to have a shot with fruits and flowers on her navel as part of a song sequence. She told in an interview,\"That's the third day of shooting with KRR sir and we're canning a song. But actually he's not making any flower or fruit thrown at my navel or waist, that's why I took courage to ask him to hit my navel with them\"\n\nThe 2013 Telugu film \"Action 3D\" paid tribute to Raghavendra Rao with a song featuring his symbolic acts on the female protagonist's navel.\nA song sequence in the 2012 Telugu spoof film \"Sudigadu\" features the main protagonist dropping a watermelon and a pumpkin on the female protagonist's navel.\nActress Monal Gajjar who has acted in the scene had commented on an interview, \"When the hero throws it on my tummy I am supposed to scream with a strange sound and they told me they are not real, all are toy fruits.\"\n\nFemale dancers of Bollywood have always exposed their navels, since Amrapali (1966), with cameras focused on them. In the 1968 Bollywood film \"Brahmachari\", actress Mumtaz was seen in a Sharara sari showing her navel for a song and dance number, \"Aaj kal tere mere\". A Sharara has a long blouse top with a unique divided skirt bottom, which has less flow than \"lehenga\". It fits like a loose pant until reaching the knee, where it flares out. The particular style of sari became extremely popular and was dubbed the Mumtaz Sari. The 1981 film \"Ek Duuje Ke Liye\", a remake of the 1978 \"Maro Charitra\" featured the replication of the \"top spinning on the navel\" scene with Rati Agnihotri. She had stated in an interview,\"Today, when someone asks me how I balanced the top, I don't have an answer.Those days we didn't have monitors, the luxury of too many rehearsals or retakes. I did what was expected of me, telling myself it was like dramatics day in school, only instead of the stage I was facing a camera\". The film \"Khalnayak\" (1993) was famous for the song \"Choli ke Peeche\" featuring Madhuri Dixit in navel-exposing attire. In the 2003 film \"Jism\", actress Bipasha Basu appeared in a foreplay scene with an ice cube on her navel. Actress Aishwarya Rai showcased her navel in a brocade \"choli\" and dipped \"ghagra\" for the hit song \"Kajra Re\" in the film \"Bunty Aur Babli\" (2005). Katrina Kaif became famous for her dance performance showcasing her navel for the item number Sheila Ki Jawani for the 2010 film \"Tees Maar Khan\". Film critic Baradwaj Rangan stated on his blog in a review for the film, \"Katrina Kaif makes her entry in the well-shot, well-scored Sheela ki jawani song sequence, brandishing a belly button that seems to have a life of its own\". For the 2011 film \"The Dirty Picture\", actress Vidya Balan had acted in a scene where an egg put on her navel becomes an omelette. She stated in an interview, \"It was difficult to control laughter and Milan used to wait to get me into the character because all this was part of the song and dance of those times to market the Silk phenomenon\". Recently, Rakhi Sawant appeared in an item song \"Latto Ghuma Re Chora\" for the 2012 film \"Rakhtbeej\" in which a top is spun on her midriff and navel. She stated in an interview that the filming was painful since the director spun the sharp-pointed top 30 times on her midriff.\n\nThe Censor Board of India for Indian cinema has created some limitations on \"vulgar\" visuals, such as restricting zoom shots of the navel, kissing the navel, and squeezing the navel and waist. It had been implemented during the 1990s. Many films have faced censor cuts for navel scenes.\n\nMany actors have expressed mixed views on the display of and emphasize of the navel. Some feel displaying the midriff or navel cannot be considered exposing when compared to Hollywood films. Actress Shilpa Shetty argued, \"If navel-showing is obscenity, then our traditional Indian outfitthe traditional sarishould be banned in the first place.\" Actress, BJP member and CBFC member Jeevitha while speaking on item numbers stated, \"Dance numbers are okay, but girls don't need to dress vulgarly. They can wear skirts but not too much below the navel.\" Telugu film director Krishna Vamsi commented, \"All film-makers have problems with the censors. They sometimes object to showing the navel of a woman when, in other films, it is allowed. We cannot even question them. The censors should give us general rules in writing as to what is allowed and what is not, instead of taking decisions according to their whims and fancies.\" Actor R. Madhavan commented, \"I have often been embarrassed to see certain films I have done. ... when I see myself kissing a dancing heroine's navel in some films, I feel ashamed.\" Actress Taapsee Pannu commented, \"I believe the navel is overrated. I think sensuality can be expressed in other ways.\" Bengali actress Swastika Mukherjee said, \"I am not very comfortable though I have tried wearing a \"lehenga choli\" with a stick-on in my navel.\" Many actresses have opted to hide their navels by wearing trikinis for beach or pool scenes.\n\nJapan has long had a special regard for the navel. During the early Jōmon period in northern Japan, three small balls indicating the breasts and navel were pasted onto flat clay objects to represent the female body. The navel was exaggerated in size, informed by the belief that the navel symbolizes the center of where life begins. On many middle Jomon figurines, the significance of the navel was emphasized with an indentation or hole. Sometimes, the importance of the navel was further enhanced by connecting with a line from the navel towards the chest. Early Japanese poems feature many references to the female navel. In some, the word \"navel\" actually refers to an indentation or hole instead of the belly button. The shape of the umbilicus of a newborn baby would be discussed at length. If a baby's navel points downward, the parents would brace themselves for a weakling child who will bring them woe. The thunder god Raijin, with his terrifying drums, great horns, and long tusks, was said to have an insatiable appetite for young navels, and mothers had to nag their youngsters constantly to keep themselves well covered up. Due to the mythology, navel exposure was not encouraged in the earlier times. The traditional clothing of Japanese women has a wide cloth belt around the midriff to protect the belly and keep it warm. The Japanese believe the belly is the source of person's warmth and that the perfect navel is an innie.\n\nAlthough navel exposure has become a recent trend in fashion in Japan, annual \"Heso Matsuri\" (\"belly button festivals\") have been held in Japan since the late 1960s. The tradition of the Hokkaido \"Heso Odori\" (\"belly button dance\") began in 1968. Dancers make their \"heso\" (\"belly button\") into a face, using paint, special costumes, and props. Many variations of the dance have been developed, leading to competitions among dancers, who compete for prizes in various categories.\n\nA similar type festival is held at Shibukawa, north of Tokyo. The idea was formed based on the location of Shibukawa, which is also referred to as the \"Belly Button of Japan\". The festival is based on a traditional Japanese form of entertainment where revelers paint a face on their torsos and stomachs to appear as a head. A \"kimono\" is wrapped around the waist, and the person's real head is hidden by a large cloth hat. The belly button is traditionally painted into a mouth. In recent years, modern motifs and Japanese anime designs have appeared in the festival.\n\nSigiriya frescoes depict royal ladies wearing cloth draped as a \"dhoti\", tied in a knot at the front and pulled down to expose the navel. They wear pleated robes from the waist upwards, as well a necklace, armlets, wristlets, ear and hair ornaments, and display their breasts. The ladies in waiting wear waist clothes, a few ornaments and a firm \"thanapatiya\" (\"breast bandage\").\n\nIn the Sinhalese poetic work Kaviyasekara, a father advises his married daughter as to proper clothing, \"Dress your garment above your navel, without exposing the fair bosom, and expose not your teeth in laughing.\"\n\nIn his work \"Daily Code for the Laity\" (1898), the Buddhist leader Anagarika Dharmapala wrote that a sari blouse must be long, fully covering a woman's breasts, midriff, navel, and back.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, a visible navel was very rare. By the late 1990s, the Bollywood connection and the media and technological changes that occurred in India had influenced Sri Lanka's fashion outlook, with the navel becoming a focus in the modern Sri Lankan wardrobe. Sri Lankan films commonly depict the women of the country's earliest history as scantily clad with exposed navels, and the country has become more open to the topic in general. In Nov 2015, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya stated that a school dress code for students and teachers would be issued requiring that the navel be covered. However, the Ceylon Teachers Union President Joseph Stalin condemned it and commented, \"We condemn this statement. It is an anachronistic proposal. We see nothing wrong with teachers wearing sarees below the belly button. It may be that there is something wrong with Mr. Devapriya’s eye sight. We like to ask the Chief Minister whether the belly button is the main concern facing the education sector in the Western Province\".\n\nIn 2004, the President of Indonesia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono spoke out against exposed navels, saying, \"Indonesian women, who are known for their courtesy, should refrain from exposing their midriffs or belly buttons, which now seems to be taken for granted. There are many ways to express beauty, as part of aesthetics, and to express freedom but not by showing things that lead to pornography.\" He further added that while the state could not dictate dress codes, citizens were expected to respect the country's moral values and courtesy. A week later, a cabinet minister quoted Yudhoyono as saying that he felt \"disturbed and uneasy\" to see television shows in which women exposed their navels.\n\nIn 2006, Agus Suwage, an Indonesian artist, installed his Pinkswing Park exhibit at Jakarta's international biennale.The exhibit was surrounded by massive panels with multiple pictures of a near-naked man and woman frolicking in a park. Within days of the exhibition's launch, Islamic fundamentalists had descended on the biennale, forcing its closure and demanding prosecutions. At first police claimed his work blasphemed the story of Adam and Eve; a few weeks later they told Suwage he faced five years in jail for producing pornography. The Indonesian parliament decided to introduce a sweeping anti-pornography law. The law imposes a rigid social template; couples who kiss in public will face up to five years' jail, as would anyone flaunting a \"sensual body part\"—including their navel—and tight clothing will be outlawed. Due to this new anti-pornography law, topless bathing and surfing on the beaches of Bali, a common practice among tourists, would also be prohibited. The law would also affect older tribal women, who often still walk topless. The introduction of a bill was attacked by women's rights campaigners in the country, who fear it is the first step towards the implementation of Islamic Sharia law.\n\nDespite these laws, pop singers such as Inul Daratista, known for her hip swaying moves, and Agnez Mo continue exposing their navels, but undergo some restrictions in advertisements.\n\nTraditionally, Korean women are expected to dress modestly. The traditional wear such as Hanbok cover the entire body.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the fashion trend among young South Korean women for wearing cropped T-shirts that leave the midriff exposed had started, due to the hot climatic conditions. The trend spread to create changes in female fashion such that when a policeman in Gwangju arrested two young women for flaunting their belly buttons in the street, the judge threw the case out, ruling that the flashing of a female navel was not indecent. It further became popular due to Korean pop culture, where K-pop stars started wearing body piercings and midriff-exposing shirts. In July 1997, the South Korean broadcaster KBS announced tough new rules for pop stars appearing on TV. One among the many limitations was \"no exposing of navels\".\n\nDuring the 2000s, it became common among young women to expose their belly buttons by rolling up their shirts similar to a crop-top. During sport events such as football, the female audience apply body paints or temporary tattoos around their belly buttons. In 2010, Korean girl group Rainbow's dance routine that involved lifting up their shirts to expose their navels became popular. The band stated in an interview, \"We have to keep our abs in shape for the belly button dance.\" But the routine was subsequently has been banned. The SBS TV show \"Inkigayo\" told girl groups to restrain showing their skin too much and about their outfits. In 2013, Yoona, a member of Korean girl band Girls' Generation, caused a minor controversy by revealing an exposed midriff featuring a protruding cantaloupe-like outie navel, which started a spirited discussion and polarized opinions on the Chinese-language internet.\n\nAlthough, the formal wear is expected to cover the stomach and belly button.\n\nIn 2005, Vivienne, a virtual girlfriend created by software maker Artificial Life Inc. of Hong Kong, was reprogrammed not to bare her navel or display body piercings in conservative Muslim countries including Malaysia to avoid problems. In 2006, Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat gave his blessings to an Islamic form of dance clubs to serve as entertainment outlets at Kota Bharu. He commented that there must be proper attire for women, including clothes that do not reveal the navel, saying Muslim women must be covered from head to toe except for their face and hands, while Muslim men must be decently dressed when in public. Under Malaysian government rules for stage performances, a female artist must be covered from her shoulders to her knees. This law prevented pop icon Beyoncé Knowles from performing in navel-exposing attire in 2007. Beyoncé canceled the show amid opposition from local groups, calling the cancellation a result of a \"scheduling conflict\".\n\nSaint Thomas Aquinas considered the navel as the \"bodily metaphor for spiritual things\".\n\nIn Indian traditional medicine, the \"Cyperus rotundus\" tuber is made into a paste and applied around the navel to relieve pain caused by roundworms. Pomegranate plant juice and paste is used to treat snake bites; the juice is dropped into the nostrils, ears, and navel. Applying a little bit of ghee or mustard oil on cotton and keeping it on the navel overnight is considered a remedy for dry lips. Castor oil is applied to the navel of infants as a remedy for stomach aches. The Gonds, a tribe from central India, apply \"Gloriosa superba\" rhizome extract over the navel and vagina to cause labour pain and perform normal delivery.\n\nAccording to Ayurveda, the navel is an important site in the human body. Nearly 72,000 subtle nerves, or \"nadis\" converge in this area. By the principles of Ayurveda and yoga, the human body is made up of six \"chakras\", with the \"Manipura chakra\" located at the spine directly behind either the navel or the solar plexus, depending on the system, while its \"kshetram\", or superficial activation point, is located directly on the navel and represents the element fire. Vayu or vital wind as specified in Ayurveda, is divided into five sub categories. Of these, Samāna Vayu, situated in the navel region, is believed to aid in digestion and give physical strength to the body.\n\nAccording to Ayurvedic principles, navel displacement is a condition in which the navel center shifts.\nThis might create digestive disorders. Proper practice of yoga is considered to be a remedy to realigning the navel.\n\nIn Sri Lanka traditional medicine, a composition of herbs, powdered pepper, and water is applied as a paste to the navel as a remedy for stomach aches. During difficulties in delivery, a betel leaf is placed on the woman's navel, which is believed to be under a spell.\n\nLaying wormwood on the female navel or spreading a paste of reindeer lichen on the navel were considered by Russian women to make the delivery of a child fast and painless.\n\nIn the Chinese art of acupuncture, the navel is sometimes referred to as 神阙 (\"shénquè\", roughly translating to divine imperfection or mark of the ancestors). Often, the navel is used as a moxibustion point. However, the navel itself is not used in acupuncture due to the likelihood of infection.\n\n"}

It is a prehistoric novel dealing with the interaction between Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons. A sequel, \"Singletusk\", published in 1982, continues the story of the family. \nSet 35,000 years ago in Scandinavia, during a thaw in the great Ice Age, the novel follows a Cro-Magnon named Tiger as he tries to defeat Shelk, a tyrant and a hybrid (Neanderthal/Cro-Magnon), the man who killed his father. With his family and much of his tribe dead, Tiger meets, interacts, and allies himself with groups of Neanderthals. He eventually marries a Neanderthal woman.\n\nNeanderthals are depicted as white-skinned, while Cro-Magnons are dark. Kurtén's skin color identification for both populations appears to agree with recent DNA studies, including those proposing the African origin of modern humans. His racial presentation of the Cro-Magnon is in contrast to Jean M. Auel's view in her \"Earth's Children\" series. Auel's initial book, published a few years later than \"Dance of the Tiger\", portrayed Neanderthals as light-skinned and Cro-Magnons as more racially varied, either light or dark-skinned. The author himself says \"The book is not intended to be a 'theory about interaction between Neanderthals and Modern Humans', it is just a fictive description of one possible scenario among several that might have taken place\".\n\nCro-Magnon children and adults are portrayed as having smooth brows and small faces; the characteristic features of childhood act as \"innate releasing mechanisms\" for feelings of affection.\n\nKurtén postulates that this attraction led to intermarriage between the two people, which produced sterile offspring. He emphasizes the possibility of Neanderthal extinction through inter-breeding rather than through violence. He also presents social differences between the two groups, presenting the Cro-Magnon people as more aggressive, practicing slavery and choosing violence to solve social problems. The Neanderthal society, based on a matriarchal system, is drawn as peace-loving with elaborate social rituals designed to resolve problems.\n\nThe novel is known for its plausibility and accuracy. Kurtén's supposition that Neanderthals and ancestors of modern \"Homo sapiens\" occupied same areas in the same time in Europe has been confirmed by fossil evidence.\n\nKurtén wasn't the first novelist to examine the subject; for instance author William Golding also examined the issue of Neanderthal extinction in \"The Inheritors\".\n\n"}

The artists are unknown, but a widespread rumor states that a group of famous animators created the film for a private party in honor of Winsor McCay. Disney animator Ward Kimball gave the following account of the history of the short:\nThe first porno-cartoon was made in New York. It was called \"Eveready Harton\" and was made in the late 1920s, silent, of course—by three studios. Each one did a section of it without telling the other studios what they were doing. Studio A finished the first part and gave the last drawing to Studio B [...] Involved were Max Fleischer, Paul Terry and the Mutt and Jeff studio. They didn't see the finished product till the night of the big show. A couple of guys who were there tell me the laughter almost blew the top off the hotel where they were screening it.\n\nWhen a copy of the short was screened in San Francisco in the late 1970s, the program notes attributed the animation to George Stalling, George Canata, Rudy Zamora, Sr., and Walter Lantz. The short circulated informally, shown only at small underground festivals or parties, until 2002 when it was included in the theatrically released compilation \"The Good Old Naughty Days\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "459088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=459088", "title": "Flag of Ghana", "text": "Flag of Ghana\n\nThe national flag of Ghana was designed and adopted in 1957 and was flown until 1962, and then reinstated in 1966. It consists of the Pan-African colours of red, gold, and green, in horizontal stripes, with a black five-pointed star in the centre of the gold stripe. The Ghanaian flag was the second African flag after the flag of the Ethiopian Empire to feature these colours. The flag's design influenced that of the flag of Guinea-Bissau (1973). The flag of Ghana was designed by Theodosia Okoh (1922–2015).\n\nThe red represents the blood of those who died in the country's struggle for independence from Great Britain, the gold represents the mineral wealth of the country, the green symbolises the country's rich forests and natural wealth, and the black star is the symbol of African emancipation. The black star was adopted from the flag of the Black Star Line, a shipping line incorporated by Marcus Garvey that operated from 1919 to 1922. It is where the Ghana national football team derive their nickname, the \"Black Stars\".\n\nUnder terms of section 183 of Ghana's Merchant Shipping Act of 1963, the civil ensign is a red flag with the national flag in a black-fimbriated canton. In 2003, a new merchant shipping act was enacted, however, and this simply provides that \"the National Flag of Ghana\" is the proper national colours for Ghanaian ships. No mention is made of other flags or other possible flags.\n\nThe naval ensign is a red St. George's Cross on white flag, with the national flag in canton.\n\nThe Ghana Air Force has its own ensign that incorporates the flag of Ghana. Civil aviation in Ghana is represented by the national civil air ensign. It is a standard light-blue field with the Ghanaian flag in the canton. It is charged in the fly with either a red, yellow and green roundel (in the case of the military ensign) or black five-pointed star (in the case of the civil ensign). Both have been used since Independence in 1957, and the subsequent founding of the Ghana Air Force in 1959.\n\nThe Ghanaian government flag, adopted in 1957, was flown until 1962. Similarly, when the country formed the Union of African States, the flag of the Union was modeled on Bolivia's flag, but with two black stars, representing the nations. In May 1959, a third star was added.\n\nFollowing the January 1964 constitutional referendum, Ghana adopted a variant of the 1957 tricolour with white in the place of yellow, after the colours of Kwame Nkrumah's ruling and then-sole legal party Convention People's Party, making it similar to the flag of Hungary. The original 1957 flag was reinstated on February 1966 following Nkrumah's overthrow in a \"coup d'état\".\n\n"}
{"id": "12284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12284", "title": "Grimoire", "text": "Grimoire\n\nA grimoire ( ) (also known as a “book of spells”) is a textbook of magic, typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like talismans and amulets, how to perform magical spells, charms and divination, and how to summon or invoke supernatural entities such as angels, spirits, deities and demons. In many cases, the books themselves are believed to be imbued with magical powers, although in many cultures, other sacred texts that are not grimoires (such as the Bible) have been believed to have supernatural properties intrinsically. In this manner, while all \"books on magic\" could be thought of as grimoires, not all \"magical books\" should be thought of as grimoires.\n\nWhile the term \"grimoire\" is originally European and many Europeans throughout history, particularly ceremonial magicians and cunning folk, have used grimoires, the historian Owen Davies noted that similar books can be found all across the world, ranging from Jamaica to Sumatra. He also noted that in this sense, the world's first grimoires were created in Europe and the Ancient Near East.\n\nIt is most commonly believed that the term \"grimoire\" originated from the Old French word \"grammaire\", which had initially been used to refer to all books written in Latin. By the 18th century, the term had gained its now common usage in France, and had begun to be used to refer purely to books of magic. Owen Davies presumed this was because \"many of them continued to circulate in Latin manuscripts\".\n\nHowever, the term \"grimoire\" later developed into a figure of speech amongst the French indicating something that was hard to understand. In the 19th century, with the increasing interest in occultism amongst the British following the publication of Francis Barrett's \"The Magus\" (1801), the term entered the English language in reference to books of magic.\n\nThe earliest known written magical incantations come from ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), where they have been found inscribed on cuneiform clay tablets that archaeologists excavated from the city of Uruk and dated to between the 5th and 4th centuries BC. The ancient Egyptians also employed magical incantations, which have been found inscribed on amulets and other items. The Egyptian magical system, known as heka, was greatly altered and enhanced after the Macedonians, led by Alexander the Great, invaded Egypt in 332 BC.\n\nUnder the next three centuries of Hellenistic Egypt, the Coptic writing system evolved, and the Library of Alexandria was opened. This likely had an influence upon books of magic, with the trend on known incantations switching from simple health and protection charms to more specific things, such as financial success and sexual fulfillment. Around this time the legendary figure of Hermes Trismegistus developed as a conflation of the Egyptian god Thoth and the Greek Hermes; this figure was associated with writing and magic and, therefore, of books on magic.\n\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans believed that books on magic were invented by the Persians. The 1st-century AD writer Pliny the Elder stated that magic had been first discovered by the ancient philosopher Zoroaster around the year 647 BC but that it was only written down in the 5th century BC by the magician Osthanes. His claims are not, however, supported by modern historians.\n\nThe ancient Jewish people were often viewed as being knowledgeable in magic, which, according to legend, they had learned from Moses, who had learned it in Egypt. Among many ancient writers, Moses was seen as an Egyptian rather than a Jew. Two manuscripts likely dating to the 4th century, both of which purport to be the legendary eighth Book of Moses (the first five being the initial books in the Biblical Old Testament), present him as a polytheist who explained how to conjure gods and subdue demons.\n\nMeanwhile, there is definite evidence of grimoires being used by certain, particularly Gnostic, sects of early Christianity. In the \"Book of Enoch\" found within the Dead Sea Scrolls, for instance, there is information on astrology and the angels. In possible connection with the \"Book of Enoch\", the idea of Enoch and his great-grandson Noah having some involvement with books of magic given to them by angels continued through to the medieval period.\n\nIsraelite King Solomon was a Biblical figure associated with magic and sorcery in the ancient world. The 1st-century Romano-Jewish historian Josephus mentioned a book circulating under the name of Solomon that contained incantations for summoning demons and described how a Jew called Eleazar used it to cure cases of possession. The book may have been the \"Testament of Solomon\" but was more probably a different work. The pseudepigraphic \"Testament of Solomon\" is one of the oldest magical texts. It is a Greek manuscript attributed to Solomon and likely written in either Babylonia or Egypt sometime in the first five centuries AD, over 1,000 years after Solomon's death.\n\nThe work tells of the building of The Temple and relates that construction was hampered by demons until the angel Michael gave the king a magical ring. The ring, engraved with the Seal of Solomon, had the power to bind demons from doing harm. Solomon used it to lock demons in jars and commanded others to do his bidding, although eventually, according to the \"Testament\", he was tempted into worshiping \"false gods\", such as Moloch, Baal, and Rapha. Subsequently, after losing favour with God, King Solomon wrote the work as a warning and a guide to the reader.\n\nWhen Christianity became the dominant faith of the Roman Empire, the early Church frowned upon the propagation of books on magic, connecting it with paganism, and burned books of magic. The New Testament records that after the unsuccessful exorcism by the seven sons of Sceva became known, many converts decided to burn their own magic and pagan books in the city of Ephesus; this advice was adopted on a large scale after the Christian ascent to power. Even before Christianisation, the Imperial Roman government had suppressed many pagan, Christian, philosophical, and divinatory texts that it viewed as threats to Roman authority, including those of the Greek mystic and mathematician Pythagoras.\n\nIn the Medieval period, the production of grimoires continued in Christendom, as well as amongst Jews and the followers of the newly founded Islamic faith. As the historian Owen Davies noted, \"while the [Christian] Church was ultimately successful in defeating pagan worship it never managed to demarcate clearly and maintain a line of practice between religious devotion and magic.\" The use of such books on magic continued. In Christianised Europe, the Church divided books of magic into two kinds: those that dealt with \"natural magic\" and those that dealt in \"demonic magic\".\n\nThe former was acceptable because it was viewed as merely taking note of the powers in nature that were created by God; for instance, the Anglo-Saxon leechbooks, which contained simple spells for medicinal purposes, were tolerated. Demonic magic was not acceptable, because it was believed that such magic did not come from God, but from the Devil and his demons. These grimoires dealt in such topics as necromancy, divination and demonology. Despite this, \"there is ample evidence that the mediaeval clergy were the main practitioners of magic and therefore the owners, transcribers, and circulators of grimoires,\" while several grimoires were attributed to Popes.\nOne such Arabic grimoire devoted to astral magic, the 12th-century \"Ghâyat al-Hakîm fi'l-sihr\", was later translated into Latin and circulated in Europe during the 13th century under the name of the \"Picatrix\". However, not all such grimoires of this era were based upon Arabic sources. The 13th-century \"Sworn Book of Honorius\", for instance, was (like the ancient \"Testament of Solomon\" before it) largely based on the supposed teachings of the Biblical king Solomon and included ideas such as prayers and a ritual circle, with the mystical purpose of having visions of God, Hell, and Purgatory and gaining much wisdom and knowledge as a result. Another was the Hebrew \"Sefer Raziel Ha-Malakh\", translated in Europe as the \"Liber Razielis Archangeli\".\n\nA later book also claiming to have been written by Solomon was originally written in Greek during the 15th century, where it was known as the \"Magical Treatise of Solomon\" or the \"Little Key of the Whole Art of Hygromancy, Found by Several Craftsmen and by the Holy Prophet Solomon\". In the 16th century, this work had been translated into Latin and Italian, being renamed the \"Clavicula Salomonis\", or the \"Key of Solomon\".\n\nIn Christendom during the medieval age, grimoires were written that were attributed to other ancient figures, thereby supposedly giving them a sense of authenticity because of their antiquity. The German abbot and occultist Trithemius (1462–1516) supposedly had a \"Book of Simon the Magician\", based upon the New Testament figure of Simon Magus. Simon Magus had been a contemporary of Jesus Christ's and, like the Biblical Jesus, had supposedly performed miracles, but had been demonized by the Medieval Church as a devil worshiper and evil individual.\n\nSimilarly, it was commonly believed by medieval people that other ancient figures, such as the poet Virgil, astronomer Ptolemy and philosopher Aristotle, had been involved in magic, and grimoires claiming to have been written by them were circulated. However, there were those who did not believe this; for instance, the Franciscan friar Roger Bacon (c. 1214–94) stated that books falsely claiming to be by ancient authors \"ought to be prohibited by law.\"\n\nAs the early modern period commenced in the late 15th century, many changes began to shock Europe that would have an effect on the production of grimoires. Historian Owen Davies classed the most important of these as the Protestant Reformation and subsequent Catholic Counter-Reformation, the witch-hunts and the advent of printing. The Renaissance saw the continuation of interest in magic that had been found in the Mediaeval period, and in this period, there was an increased interest in Hermeticism among occultists and ceremonial magicians in Europe, largely fueled by the 1471 translation of the ancient \"Corpus hermeticum\" into Latin by Marsilio Ficino (1433–99).\n\nAlongside this, there was a rise in interest in the Jewish mysticism known as the Kabbalah, which was spread across the continent by Pico della Mirandola and Johannes Reuchlin. The most important magician of the Renaissance was Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535), who widely studied occult topics and earlier grimoires and eventually published his own, the \"Three Books of Occult Philosophy\", in 1533. A similar figure was the Swiss magician known as Paracelsus (1493–1541), who published \"Of the Supreme Mysteries of Nature\", in which he emphasised the distinction between good and bad magic. A third such individual was Johann Georg Faust, upon whom several pieces of later literature were written, such as Christopher Marlowe's \"Doctor Faustus\", that portrayed him as consulting with demons.\n\nThe idea of demonology had remained strong in the Renaissance, and several demonological grimoires were published, including \"The Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy\", which falsely claimed to having been authored by Agrippa, and the \"Pseudomonarchia Daemonum\", which listed 69 demons. To counter this, the Roman Catholic Church authorised the production of many works of exorcism, the rituals of which were often very similar to those of demonic conjuration. Alongside these demonological works, grimoires on natural magic continued to be produced, including \"Magia naturalis\", written by Giambattista Della Porta (1535–1615).\n\nThe advent of printing in Europe meant that books could be mass-produced for the first time and could reach an ever-growing literate audience. Among the earliest books to be printed were magical texts. The \"nóminas\" were one example, consisting of prayers to the saints used as talismans. It was particularly in Protestant countries, such as Switzerland and the German states, which were not under the domination of the Roman Catholic Church, where such grimoires were published.\n\nDespite the advent of print, however, handwritten grimoires remained highly valued, as they were believed to contain inherent magical powers, and they continued to be produced. With increasing availability, people lower down the social scale and women began to have access to books on magic; this was often incorporated into the popular folk magic of the average people and, in particular, that of the cunning folk, who were professionally involved in folk magic. These works left Europe and were imported to the parts of Latin America controlled by the Spanish and Portuguese empires and the parts of North America controlled by the British and French empires.\n\nThroughout this period, the Inquisition, a Roman Catholic organisation, had organised the mass suppression of peoples and beliefs that they considered heretical. In many cases, grimoires were found in the heretics' possessions and destroyed. In 1599, the church published the \"Indexes of Prohibited Books\", in which many grimoires were listed as forbidden, including several mediaeval ones, such as the \"Key of Solomon\", which were still popular.\n\nIn Christendom, there also began to develop a widespread fear of witchcraft, which was believed to be Satanic in nature. The subsequent hysteria, known as the Witch Hunt, caused the death of around 40,000 people, most of whom were women. Sometimes, those found with grimoires, particularly demonological ones, were prosecuted and dealt with as witches but, in most cases, those accused had no access to such books. Highly literate Iceland proved an exception to this, where a third of the 134 witch trials held involved people who had owned grimoires. By the end of the Early Modern period and the beginning of the Enlightenment, many European governments brought in laws prohibiting many superstitious beliefs in an attempt to bring an end to the Witch Hunt; this would invariably affect the release of grimoires.\n\nMeanwhile, Hermeticism and the Kabbalah would influence the creation of a mystical philosophy known as Rosicrucianism, which first appeared in the early 17th century, when two pamphlets detailing the existence of the mysterious Rosicrucian group were published in Germany. These claimed that Rosicrucianism had originated with a Medieval figure known as Christian Rosenkreuz, who had founded the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross; however, there was no evidence for the existence of Rosenkreuz or the Brotherhood.\n\nThe 18th century saw the rise of the Enlightenment, a movement devoted to science and rationalism, predominantly amongst the ruling classes. However, amongst much of Europe, belief in magic and witchcraft persisted, as did the witch trials in certain areas. Governments tried to crack down on magicians and fortune tellers, particularly in France, where the police viewed them as social pests who took money from the gullible, often in a search for treasure. In doing so, they confiscated many grimoires.\n\nA new form of printing developed in France, the \"Bibliothèque bleue\". Many grimoires published through this circulated among an ever-growing percentage of the populace, in particular the \"Grand Albert\", the \"Petit Albert\" (1782), the \"Grimoire du Pape Honorius\" and the \"Enchiridion Leonis Papae\". The \"Petit Albert\" contained a wide variety of forms of magic, for instance, dealing in simple charms for ailments along with more complex things such as the instructions for making a Hand of Glory.\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, following the French Revolution of 1789, a hugely influential grimoire was published under the title of the \"Grand Grimoire\", which was considered particularly powerful, because it involved conjuring and making a pact with the devil's chief minister, Lucifugé Rofocale, to gain wealth from him. A new version of this grimoire was later published under the title of the \"Dragon rouge\" and was available for sale in many Parisian bookstores. Similar books published in France at the time included the \"Black Pullet\" and the \"Grimoirium Verum\". The \"Black Pullet\", probably authored in late-18th-century Rome or France, differs from the typical grimoires in that it does not claim to be a manuscript from antiquity but told by a man who was a member of Napoleon's armed expeditionary forces in Egypt.\n\nThe widespread availability of printed grimoires in France—despite the opposition of both the rationalists and the church—soon spread to neighbouring countries such as Spain and Germany. In Switzerland, Geneva was commonly associated with the occult at the time, particularly by Catholics, because it had been a stronghold of Protestantism. Many of those interested in the esoteric traveled from Roman Catholic nations to Switzerland to purchase grimoires or to study with occultists. Soon, grimoires appeared that involved Catholic saints; one example that appeared during the 19th century that became relatively popular, particularly in Spain, was the \"Libro de San Cipriano\", or \"The Book of St. Ciprian\", which falsely claimed to date from c. 1000. Like most grimoires of this period, it dealt with (among other things) how to discover treasure.\n\nIn Germany, with the increased interest in folklore during the 19th century, many historians took an interest in magic and in grimoires. Several published extracts of such grimoires in their own books on the history of magic, thereby helping to further propagate them. Perhaps the most notable of these was the Protestant pastor Georg Conrad Horst (1779–1832), who from 1821 to 1826, published a six-volume collection of magical texts in which he studied grimoires as a peculiarity of the Mediaeval mindset.\n\nAnother scholar of the time interested in grimoires, the antiquarian bookseller Johann Scheible, first published the \"Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses\", two influential magical texts that claimed to have been written by the ancient Jewish figure Moses. \"The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses\" were among the works that later spread to the countries of Scandinavia, where, in Danish and Swedish, grimoires were known as black books and were commonly found among members of the army.\n\nIn Britain, new grimoires continued to be produced throughout the 18th century, such as Ebenezer Sibly's \"A New and Complete Illustration of the Celestial Science of Astrology\". In the last decades of that century, London experienced a revival of interest in the occult that was further propagated when Francis Barrett published \"The Magus\" in 1801. \"The Magus\" contained many things taken from older grimoires, particularly those of Cornelius Agrippa, and while not achieving initial popularity upon release, gradually became an influential text.\n\nOne of Barrett's pupils, John Parkin, created his own handwritten grimoire, \"The Grand Oracle of Heaven, or, The Art of Divine Magic\", although it was never published, largely because Britain was at war with France, and grimoires were commonly associated with the French. The only writer to publish British grimoires widely in the early 19th century, Robert Cross Smith, released \"The Philosophical Merlin\" (1822) and \"The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Century\" (1825), but neither sold well.\n\nIn the late 19th century, several of these texts (including \"The Book of Abramelin\" and the \"Key of Solomon\") were reclaimed by para-Masonic magical organisations, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Ordo Templi Orientis.\n\n\"The Secret Grimoire of Turiel\" claims to have been written in the 16th century, but no copy older than 1927 has been produced.\n\nA modern grimoire, the \"Simon Necronomicon\", takes its name from a fictional book of magic in the stories of H. P. Lovecraft, inspired by Babylonian mythology and by the \"Ars Goetia\", a section in the \"Lesser Key of Solomon\" that concerns the summoning of demons. The \"Azoëtia\" of Andrew D. Chumbley has been described by Gavin Semple as a modern grimoire.\n\nThe neopagan religion of Wicca publicly appeared in the 1940s, and Gerald Gardner introduced the \"Book of Shadows\" as a Wiccan grimoire.\n\nOberon Zell-Ravenheart, headmaster of the Grey School of Wizardry, wrote and compiled the school's \"Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard\" (New Page, 2004) and the sequel \"Companion for the Apprentice Wizard\" (New Page 2006).\n\nThe term grimoire commonly serves as an alternative name for a spell book or tome of magical knowledge in fantasy fiction and role-playing games. The most famous fictional grimoire is the \"Necronomicon\", a creation of H. P. Lovecraft.\n\n"}

Fred cheekily boasts about his physical attributes over a festive pop/house groove, which should have no trouble duplicating its success here.\"\n\nThe idea for the song came about when the Fairbrass brothers were running a gym in London, where according to Richard there was \"lots of narcissism and posing\": one day he took his shirt off and started singing \"I'm too sexy for my shirt\" in front of a mirror as a joke. \n\nThe band originally recorded it as an indie rock song: it was rejected by multiple record companies before they played it to radio plugger Guy Holmes, he was initially unimpressed after playing it on his car stereo, however his passengers latched onto the song's \"I’m a model, you know what I mean\" hook and he asked the band if they could rework it as a dance track. \n\nDJ TommyD, an acquaintance of Richard Fairbrass, programmed electronics around the original vocal, whilst guitarist Rob Manzoli added a riff borrowed from the Jimi Hendrix song \"Third Stone from the Sun\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4132335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4132335", "title": "Interdisciplinary teaching", "text": "Interdisciplinary teaching\n\nInterdisciplinary teaching is a method, or set of methods, used to teach a unit across different curricular disciplines. For example, the seventh grade Language Arts, Science and Social Studies teachers might work together to form an interdisciplinary unit on rivers. \n\nThe local river system would be the unifying idea, but the English teacher would link it to Language Arts by studying river vocabulary and teaching students how to do a research report. The science teacher might teach children about the life systems that exist in the river, while the Social Studies teacher might help students research the local history and peoples who used the river for food and transport. \n\nThere are many different types, or levels, of interdisciplinary teaching. On one end, schools might employ an \"interdisciplinary team approach\", in which teachers of different content areas assigned to one group of students who are encouraged to correlate some of their teaching (Vars, 1991). The most common method of implementing integrated, interdisciplinary instruction is the \"thematic unit\", in which a common theme is studied in more than one content area (Barton & Smith, 2000).\n\nThe example given above about rivers would be considered \"multidisciplinary or parallel design\", which is defined as lessons or units developed across many disciplines with a common organizing topic (Jackson & Davis, 2000). \n\nOne of the foremost scholars of interdisciplinary teaching techniques is James Beane, who advocates for \"curriculum integration\", which is curriculum that is collaboratively designed around important issues. It has four major components: the integration of experiences, social integration, the integration of knowledge, and integration as a curriculum design. It differs from other types of interdisciplinary teaching in that it begins with a central theme that emerges from questions or social concerns students have, without regard to subject delineations (Beane, 1997).\n\nIn 1989, the seminal work, Interdisciplinary Curriculum: Design and Implementation, edited by Heidi Hayes Jacobs was published by ASCD (Alexandria, Va). In this work, she presented a continuum of options for design spanning focused disciplined work to parallel to multidisciplinary to full integration.\n\nA school district in Michigan created integration plans for thematic units, based on the ideas of Howard Gardner about multiple intelligences, in a yearlong pilot program. The results of the program included “sustained enthusiasm” from the staff, parents, and students, increased attendance rates, and improvement in standardized test scores, “especially from students with the poorest test results” (Bolak, Bialach, & Duhnphy, 2005). \n\nFlowers, Mertens, & Mulhall identify five important outcomes and findings of their experiences with interdisciplinary teaching and planning: common planning time is vital, schools that team have a more positive work climate, parental contact is more frequent, teachers report a higher job satisfaction, and student achievement scores in schools that team are higher than those that do not team (1999). \n\nAdditionally, Pumerantz & Galanto find that interdisciplinary teaching allows for students to, “Proceed at a pace commensurate with their interests, skills, and experiences” (1972). \n\nIntegrated instruction helps teachers better utilize instructional time and look deeper into subjects through a variety of content-specific lens. Another benefit of integrated instruction is that teachers can better differentiate instruction to individual student needs. Integrated instruction also allows for authentic assessment (Barton & Smith, 2000). A final benefit of interdisciplinary teaching is that students have a chance to work with multiple sources of information, thus ensuring they are receiving a more inclusive perspective than they would from consulting one textbook (Wood, 1997).\n\nHeidi Hayes Jacobs presents a four-phase approach to curriculum integration planning. (1989, ASCD, Alexandria, Va) First, she suggests that a school conduct action research to learn more about how to implement curriculum integration. This should be done six months to a year ahead of when the school is going to attempt curriculum integration. Next, phase two calls for the development of a proposal. Phase three consists of implementing and monitoring the pilot unit; this should take place in the second year of the curriculum integration plan. Phase four takes place in the third year of the plan, and calls for staff adoption of the program based on the findings from phase three (1991).\n\nScholars that advocate for curriculum integration argue that the topics studied should originate with students and their teachers, and not from district-imposed curriculum packages. This raises the important issue of accountability (Stevenson, 1998). As school districts often have decision-making panels that consist of stakeholders such as teachers, parents, and students, curriculum integration may take away their agency to make curricular choices. In addition to issues of local control, truly integrated curricula may or may not prepare students for the high-stakes tests that have become a reality for most high schools around the world, depending on whether they cover the same material. Finally, there is also concern that integrated teaching discounts the value of deep subject-specific knowledge, which is essential for specialization in areas such as medicine, law, and engineering (Gatewood, 1998). \n\nThematic units can also fall short of teaching in-depth content to students. Often a theme, such as apples, is used to link unrelated subjects, with little deference to students’ prior knowledge or interests. This superficial coverage of a topic can give students the wrong idea about school, perhaps missing the idea of curriculum integration in the first place (Barton & Smith, 2000). Thematic units can contain pointless busywork and activities created solely to create a link to a theme; for example, the alphabetizing of state capitals in a social studies unit, attempting to integrate it with language arts (Brophy & Alleman, 1991).\n\n\n"}

Working at their local laboratories over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. <br>\nThe teams are free to choose a project, which can build on previous projects or be new to iGEM. Successful projects produce cells that exhibit new and unusual properties by engineering sets of multiple genes together with mechanisms to regulate their expression. <br>\nAt the end of the summer the teams add their new BioBricks to the Parts Registry and the scientific community can build upon the expanded set of BioBricks in the next year.<br>\nAt the annual ‘iGEM Jamboree’ teams from all continents meet in Boston for a scientific conference where they present their projects to each other and to a scientific jury of ~120 judges. The judges are awarding medals, special prizes to the teams and select a ‘Grand Prize Winner’ team as well as ‘Runner-Up’ teams in each division (High School, Undergraduate and Overgraduate).<br>\n\nEach participant receives a participating certificate (see fig. below) and has the possibility to earn medals (bronze, silver and gold; see fig. below) with their team depending on different criteria that the team fulfilled in the competitions. For a bronze medal it is for example necessary to submit a new part to the Parts Registry, for a silver medal the team is required to document the functionality of a part and for a gold medal it is finally, among other criteria, necessary to obtain a proof-of-principle for the team's project. <br>\nIn 2016 as an example, 300 teams participated in the competition from which 37% received a gold medal, 25% a silver medal, 26% a bronze medal and 12% were not awarded a medal.<br>\n\nIn each division the best performance in a certain aspect of the competition is honored with special prizes.

Together with individual certificates the teams are given glass trophies for each special prize (see fig. below).<br>\n\nFrom all teams in a respective division a number of finalists is selected (1 to 6, depending on year and division) that are allowed to present their project again in front of all Jamboree participants. From the presented projects all judges select the winner of this year's iGEM competitions, the Grand Prize Winner-team that is awarded a big metal Lego-brick (see fig. below). The winning team may keep this challenge trophy for a year until it gets awarded to the next 'Grand Prize Winner'. Participants of a 'Grand Prize Winner'-team are also given challenge coins of the respective year (see fig. below).\n\niGEM developed out of student projects conducted during MIT's Independent Activities Periods in 2003 and 2004. Later in 2004, a competition with five teams from various schools was held. In 2005, teams from outside the United States took part for the first time. Since then iGEM has continued to grow, with 130 teams entering in 2010.\nRandy Rettberg, an engineer who has worked for technology companies including Apple, Sun and BBN, is the founder and director of the iGEM competition.\n\nBecause of this increasing size, in the years 2011 - 2013 the competition was split into three regions: Europe, the Americas, and Asia (though teams from Africa and Australia also entered via \"Europe\" and \"Asia\" respectively). Regional jamborees occurred during October; and some subset of teams attending those events were selected to advance to the World Championship at MIT in November.\n\nIn January 2012 the iGEM Foundation was spun out of MIT as an independent non-profit organization located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. The iGEM Foundation supports scientific research and education through operating the iGEM competition. The same year, iGEM expanded into having not only the Collegiate division, but also competitions for entrepreneurs and high school students.\n\nFor their tenth anniversary iGEM added new tracks to the existing ones: Art & Design, Community Labs, Entrepreneurship, Measurement, Microfluidics, Policy & Practice, and Software. Although Entrepreneurship and Software were tracks in previous years, in 2014 they were made more distinct in terms of their judging requirements. Furthermore, in 2014 iGEM did not have regional jamborees, but instead hosted a giant jamboree so every team could participate in one conference in Cambridge unlike in previous years where only the regional finalists were brought to Cambridge.<br>\n\nBeyond just building biological systems, broader goals of iGEM include:\n\niGEM's dual aspects of self-organization and imaginative manipulation of genetic material have demonstrated a new way to arouse student interest in modern biology and to develop their independent learning skills.\n\n\n"}

Since its launch on February 16, 2006, over 370,000 scores and 42,000 recordings for over 110,000 works by over 14,000 composers have been uploaded. Based on the wiki principle, the project uses MediaWiki software. Since June 6, 2010, the IMSLP has also included public domain and licensed recordings in its scope, to allow for study by ear.\n\nThe site was launched on February 16, 2006. The library consists mainly of scans of old musical editions out of copyright. In addition, it admits scores by contemporary composers who wish to share their music with the world by releasing it under a Creative Commons license. One of the main projects of the IMSLP was the sorting and uploading of the complete works of Johann Sebastian Bach in the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe (1851–99), a task that was completed on November 3, 2008. Besides J.S. Bach's complete public domain works, all public domain works of Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms, Joseph Canteloube, Emmanuel Chabrier, Ernest Chausson, Frédéric Chopin, Joseph Haydn, Arcangelo Corelli, Claude Debussy, Vincent d'Indy, Paul Dukas, Gabriel Fauré, Pierre-Octave Ferroud, George Frideric Handel, Jean Huré, Albéric Magnard, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Maurice Ravel, Albert Roussel, Erik Satie, Florent Schmitt, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Alexander Scriabin and Jean Sibelius are available, as well as a large percentage of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Liszt, and the works of many others as well.\n\nBesides providing a digital repository, the IMSLP offers possibilities as a musicological encyclopaedia, since multiple and historical editions of a single composition can be uploaded. Also, pages on publishers provide valuable information, and the work pages themselves often contain a large quantity of information, e.g. roles in an opera.\n\nIMSLP is recommended as a research tool by MIT, which also uses it extensively for providing scores for its OpenCourseWare courses. It is suggested as a resource by the Sibley Music Library and by libraries at other universities such as Stanford University, University of California, Los Angeles, Brown University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Manhattan School of Music University of Maryland, University of Washington, University of Cincinnati, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Appalachian State University in the US, McGill University in Canada, University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, University of Edinburgh University of Bristol in the UK, University of Melbourne in Australia, and others.\n\nIn 2007–2015, the IMSLP / Petrucci Music Library used a logo based on a score. The score image in the background was taken from the beginning of the very first printed book of music, the Harmonice Musices Odhecaton. It was published in Venice, Italy in 1501 by Ottaviano Petrucci, the library's namesake.\n\nIn 2016, the IMSLP changed its logo to a clean wordmark, featuring its two project names—\"IMSLP\" and \"Petrucci Music Library\".\n\nIn 2009, the IMSLP won the MERLOT Classics award for Music. It was named one of the Top 100 Web Sites of 2009 (in the \"Undiscovered\" subsection) by PC Magazine.\n\nOn October 19, 2007, the IMSLP closed following legal demands from Universal Edition of Vienna, Austria. The cease and desist letter expressed concern that some works that are in public domain in the server's location in Canada with copyright protection of 50 years following death, but are protected by the 70 years following death term in some other countries, were available in those countries. The administrator of the website, Edward W. Guo, also known under the nickname Feldmahler, decided to close down the repository, but left the forums online so that discussions into the best way to proceed could be made:\n\nIn response, director Michael S. Hart of Project Gutenberg offered support to keep the project online. This offer was declined by Guo, who voiced concern about having the project hosted in the United States, and consulted the Canadian wing of Project Gutenberg. On November 2, 2007, Michael Geist, a prominent Canadian copyright academic, wrote an article for the BBC discussing the specifics and the wider implications of this case.\n\nIMSLP went back online on June 30, 2008. Since its reopening, the site has been using a strict copyright policy wherein uploaded files are made accessible for download only after the copyright status for three most frequent copyright regimes has been reviewed by staff members. Although the server is located in Canada, files that are not public domain in the US were until July 2010 flagged [TB], for 'Technical Block' or 'Temporary Block', and could not be viewed. The FAQ posted in their forum stated, \"Unfortunately, these 'temporary' blocks will be until further notice – possibly all the way until the expiration of term in the USA.\" After an initial phase, [TB] flagged items have essentially disappeared thanks to the introduction of regional servers operated by unaffiliated organizations (see next).\n\nOn 21 April 2011, the Music Publishers Association (UK) issued a DMCA takedown notice against the IMSLP. Go Daddy, the domain name registrar for the IMSLP, removed the domain name \"imslp.org\", leaving it inaccessible. The MPA's argument was similar to that made in 2007 by Universal Edition. In particular, the MPA claimed that Rachmaninoff's 1913 choral symphony \"The Bells\" violated US and EU copyright. According to the IMSLP, the action is without any merit. Almost 24 hours later, the MPA (UK) announced on Twitter that they had asked Go Daddy to reinstate the domain name.\n\nOn November 7, 2017, the IMSLP received a cease and desist order from the heirs of Sergei Prokofiev after they discovered that the composer's music was available for download in countries where his music was still under copyright protection. This demand was followed up by a separate legal threat from the National Music Publishers Association on January 19, 2018. On February 23, 2018, access to all compositions by Prokofiev was blocked by the IMSLP in response to these legal threats. The issues were partially resolved on the IMSLP forums in July 2018, resulting in the reupload of Prokofiev's pre-1923 works. In August, the remainder of Prokofiev's works were reuploaded so that they would only be available in the countries they are allowed in.\n\nOn December 27, 2015, the IMSLP moved to a subscription-based model, where users are expected to pay to avoid a waiting period on some of the files available on the site, and to access certain newly uploaded files. Users who have not paid are subject to a 15-second waiting period on certain files (excluding Creative Commons-licensed files that constitute a majority of the site's files), are required to wait up to two days to access newly uploaded files, and are shown advertising.\n\nThe project leader Edward Guo claimed the changes were made because the level of funding was \"not sustainable in the long run\", but also noted:\n\nGuo attributed the change in funding to discussions with librarians at an IAML conference in June 2015. Some contributors to the website expressed concerns that Guo had not properly attempted to raise donations, but without any prior warning, introduced the membership system to monetize their work.\n\nOn April 18, 2016, the IMSLP announced on its Twitter account that all subscribers will have access to the Naxos Music Library.\n\nOn July 10, 2010, a forum thread announced the opening of a new server located in the Netherlands. This server allows works that are public domain in Canada and the EU to be downloaded legally, even if they are under copyright in the US. The server was initially run by an unaffiliated European organization, while a forum thread later announced that operations had been handed over to Project Leonardo, a new unaffiliated company incorporated in New Zealand to \"provide web hosting services to online libraries that distribute free contents in any fields of arts and science\". Files on the EU server are flagged (EU).\n\nA similar, also unaffiliated, US server allows users to download works that are in the public domain only in the US. Unlike the other servers, this one can only be contributed to by administrators and users who have asked for the privilege, though the files are freely accessible for download.\n\nOn July 1, 2013, a forum thread announced the opening of a new server located in Canada and operated by Project Leonardo, the unaffiliated company that also runs the EU server. This server is especially intended for users located in countries where copyright lasts 50 years from the death of the author, such as Canada, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, and many others. Files on the CA server are flagged (CA).\n\nOn August 23, 2011, an announcement was made that the Werner Icking Music Archive would merge with the IMSLP. WIMA had announced the merge on its own site five days before in an open letter to contributors. After working out some technical issues, the IMSLP decided to officially commence the merge on August 28. The merge was announced to be complete on July 21, 2012.\n\nIMSLP is now owned by Project Petrucci LLC, a private company created to run the website. Project Petrucci LLC was registered as a Delaware limited-liability company on June 28, 2008, when the site founder was studying at the New England Conservatory. The website provides an e-mail address for the site's founder (\"preferred\"), and a physical address for the company's registered agent in the United States (for \"any legal or formal correspondence\").\n\nProject Leonardo is an internet service provider that hosts free online content in the arts or sciences.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4085994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4085994", "title": "Jerusalem's Lot", "text": "Jerusalem's Lot\n\n\"Jerusalem's Lot\" is a short story by Stephen King, first published in King's 1978 collection \"Night Shift\". The story was also printed in the illustrated edition of \"'Salem's Lot\".\n\n\"Jerusalem's Lot\" is an epistolary short story set in the fictional town of Preacher's Corners, Cumberland County, Maine, in 1850. It is told through a series of letters and diary entries, mainly those of its main character, aristocrat Charles Boone, although his manservant, Calvin McCann, also occasionally assumes the role of narrator.\n\nCharles Boone, in letters addressed to \"Bones\", describes the arrival of himself and his manservant, Calvin McCann, at Chapelwaite, the neglected ancestral home of Charles's estranged dead cousin. Calvin learns that many people in the nearby Maine town of Preacher's Corners think Charles and Calvin are mad for living in the mansion. The house is said to be \"a bad house\", with a history of sad events, disappearances, and mysterious noises which Charles attributes to \"rats in the walls\". Calvin finds a hidden compartment in the library containing an old map of a deserted village called Jerusalem's Lot, a mysterious area the townsfolk avoid. Their curiosity piqued, Charles and Calvin set out to explore the village.\n\nThe two men find a decayed Puritan settlement. Nothing has set foot in the town since its abandonment, including animals. As the two men explore a nearby church, they discover an obscene parody of the Madonna and Child and an inverted cross. At the pulpit, they find a book filled with Latin and Druidic runes entitled \"De Vermis Mysteriis\", or \"The Mysteries of the Worm\". When Charles touches the book, the church shakes and the two men feel something gigantic moving in the ground beneath them. The evil of the place overcomes both men, and they quickly leave the village.\n\nThe inhabitants of Preacher's Corners begin fearing Charles. He is chased away from one house with rocks and guns. Charles asks Mrs. Cloris, Chapelwaite's former maid, for information about Jerusalem's Lot. She reveals that a rift in Charles' family was caused when his grandfather, Robert Boone, attempted to steal \"De Vermis Mysteriis\" from his brother, Philip, presumably to destroy it. Philip was a minister heavily involved in the occult who, on October 31, 1789, vanished along with the population of Jerusalem's Lot. Charles dismisses it as superstition, but cannot forget what he saw in the church.\n\nCalvin discovers a diary in the library, encrypted with a rail fence cipher. Before he can decipher it, Charles takes him into the cellar to check for rats. Hidden behind the walls they find the ancient, undead corpses of two of his relatives, Marcella and Randolph Boone. Charles recognizes them as \"nosferatu\". The two men flee the cellar, and Calvin seals the trapdoor to prevent any pursuit from the creatures.\n\nAs Charles recovers from the encounter, Calvin cracks the cipher. The diary, written by Robert Boone, details the history of Jerusalem's Lot and the events leading up to the mass disappearance. The village was founded by one of Charles' distant ancestors, James Boon, who was the leader of an inbred witchcraft cult. Philip and Robert took up residence in Chapelwaite, Philip was taken in by Boon's cult, and acquired \"De Vermis Mysteriis\" at Boon's behest. Philip and Boon used the book to call forth a supernatural entity referred to as \"The Worm\". In his final entry, Robert curses the whip-poor-will birds that have descended upon Chapelwaite.\n\nCharles feels compelled to return to Jerusalem's Lot. Calvin attempts to prevent it, but eventually relents, accompanying his master. They discover a butchered lamb on the church altar, lying on top of \"De Vermis Mysteriis\". Charles moves the lamb and takes the book, intending to destroy it, but a congregation of undead appears, including Philip and Boon. Charles becomes possessed and begins chanting, summoning forth the Worm. Calvin knocks down Charles, freeing him from possession. Charles sets fire to the book. The Worm lashes out from below, killing Calvin before disappearing. Before Charles can recover Calvin's body, Boon forces Charles to flee. In his final letter to \"Bones\", Charles announces his intention to commit suicide, ending the Boone family line.\n\nAn \"editor's note\" attributes Charles's letters and the death of Calvin to insanity rather than supernatural occurrences in Jerusalem's Lot. The editor notes that Charles was not the last of his line: a bastard relative still exists—the editor himself, James Robert Boone, who has moved to Chapelwaite to restore the family name. James notes that Charles was right about one thing: \"This place badly needs the services of an exterminator. There are some huge rats in the walls, by the sound.\" The note is dated October 2, the same date as Charles's first letter.\n\n\"Jerusalem's Lot\" has been adapted by artist Glenn Chadbourne for the book \"The Secretary of Dreams\", a collection of comics based on King's short fiction released by Cemetery Dance in December 2006.\n\n"}
{"id": "349555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=349555", "title": "Koro (medicine)", "text": "Koro (medicine)\n\nKoro is a culture-bound syndrome delusional disorder in which an individual has an overpowering belief that one's sex organs are retracting and will disappear, despite the lack of any true longstanding changes to the genitals. Koro is also known as shrinking penis, and it is listed in the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\". The syndrome occurs worldwide, and mass hysteria of genital-shrinkage anxiety has a history in Africa, Asia, and Europe. In the United States and Europe, the syndrome is commonly known as genital retraction syndrome. The condition can be diagnosed through psychological assessment along with physical examination to rule out genuine disorders of the genitalia that could be causing true retraction.\n\nMost patients report acute anxiety attacks due to perceived genital retraction and/or genital shrinkage, despite a lack of any objectively visible biological changes in the genitalia that are longstanding. \"Longstanding\" refers to changes that are sustained over a significant period and do not appear reversible, unlike the effect of cold temperatures on some genital regions that cause retraction. These changes may trigger a koro attack when observed, although the effects of cold temperatures are objectively reversible. According to literature, episodes usually last several hours, though the duration may be as long as two days. There are cases in which koro symptoms persist for years in a chronic state, indicating a potential co-morbidity with body dysmorphic disorder. In addition to retraction, other symptoms include a perception of alteration of penis shape and loss of penile muscle tone. In cases when sufferers have no perception of retraction, some patients may complain of genital paraesthesia or genital shortening. Among females, the cardinal symptom is nipple retraction in the breast, generally into the breast as a whole.\n\nPsychological components of koro anxiety include fear of impending death, penile dissolution and loss of sexual power. Feelings of impending death along with retraction and perceived spermatorrhea has a strong cultural link with Chinese traditional beliefs. This is demonstrated by the fact that Asians generally believe koro symptoms are fatal, unlike most patients in the West. Other ideational themes are intra-abdominal organ shrinkage, sex change to female or eunuch, non-specific physical danger, urinary obstruction, sterility, impending madness, spirit possession and a feeling of being bewitched.\n\nExtremely anxious sufferers and their family members may resort to physical methods to prevent the believed retraction of the penis. A man may perform manual or mechanical penile traction, or \"anchoring\" by a loop of string or some clamping device. Similarly, a woman may be seen grabbing her own breast, pulling her nipple, or even having iron pins inserted into the nipple. Physical injury may occur from these attempts. These forceful attempts often lead to injuries, even death.\n\nPsychosexual conflicts, personality factors, and cultural beliefs are considered as being of etiological\nsignificance to koro. Sexual adjustment histories of non-Chinese victims are often significant, such as premorbid sex inadequacy, sexual promiscuity, guilt over masturbation, and impotence.\n\nWhen considering the biological mechanisms and evolutionary history of koro, it is important to look at it in the larger framework of mass hysteria. While the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood, it has been suggested that the mirror neurons play a major role in mass hysteria outbreaks. Mirror neurons, which have been found in both human and non-human primates, are neurons that fire when one performs an action and when they observe another individual performing the same action. It is hypothesized that we evolved these mechanisms to learn from observation of others, as well as to facilitate imitation. However, within mirror neurons, there is some form of inhibitory process, which prevents us from blindly mimicking every action we observe others perform. New research into this area suggests that in mass hysteria outbreaks something goes amiss in this inhibitory process.\n\nSeveral criteria are typically used to make a diagnosis of koro. The primary criteria is a patient's report of genital (typically penile or female nipple) retraction despite a lack of objective physical evidence demonstrating retraction. This is accompanied by severe anxiety related to the retraction, fear of death as a result of retraction, and use of mechanical means to prevent retraction. Cases that do not meet all the requirements are generally classified as koro-like symptoms or given a diagnosis of partial koro syndrome. It has been argued that the criteria are sufficient but not necessary to make a diagnosis of koro. Researchers have identified koro as a possible \"cultural relative\" of body dysmorphic disorder. DSM-IV explains the process of differential diagnosis between these two disorders.\n\nA medical, psychosexual and psychiatric history should be documented. The physician should explore the patient’s concerns about appearance and body image (ruling out body dysmorphic disorder). Additionally, the physician should inquire about overall beliefs, personal values, and assumptions that the patient is making about his or her genitals. Given that Koro is often an “attack” with a great deal of associated anxiety, the physician should ascertain the patient’s emotional state along with the timeline from onset to the presentation at the examination.\n\nA physical examination should involve an assessment of overall health along with a detailed genital examination. In men, genital examination should be performed immediately after penile exposure, to avoid changes due to external temperature. The primary intent of the male exam is to exclude genuine penile anomalies such as hypospadias, epispadias and Peyronie's disease. The presence of a significant suprapubic fat pad should be noted as well. Careful measurements of flaccid length, stretched length and flaccid girth will also be useful. If male patients insist that their penis is shrinking and disappearing, measurements after intracavernosal alprostadil may be used in the office to determine the true erect length and to diagnose any penile abnormalities in the erect state. A physical examination should note any injuries inflicted by the patient in an effort to \"prevent\" retraction as further confirmation of Koro.\n\nIn DSM-IV-TR, koro is listed as one of the entries in the Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes of Appendix I. The manual gives koro's definition as \"a term, probably of Malaysian origin, that refers to an episode of sudden and intense anxiety that the penis (or, in females, the vulva and nipples) will recede into the body and possibly cause death.\" Attempts have been made by numerous authors to place koro into different classes. For example, koro may fit into the group of \"specific culture-imposed nosophobia\" (classification with cardinal sign), \"the genital retraction taxon\" (classification with common factors between syndromes), and the group with \"culture-related beliefs as causes for the occurrence\" (classification according to how the syndromes might be affected by cultural factors).\n\nVarious authors have attempted to distinguish between complete and incomplete forms of koro, along with cultural and non-cultural forms. Cultural forms are said to involve a cultural belief or myth which plays a role in the genesis and spread of the disease in the community. These are regarded as complete forms of koro, matching all the symptoms required for diagnosis without significant co-morbidity. Differentiation into primary koro, a culture-bound expression, and secondary koro. Secondary koro is proposed to have co-morbidity with a CNS disorder, another psychiatric disorder, or possible drug use.\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine recognises koro as a sexual disease and classifies it into two categories, namely \"cold conglomeration in liver\" and \"depletion of kidney's yang\".\n\nMen who present with this complaint may have Koro, but they may also be misinformed about normal genital size. Additionally, they may be suffering from penile dysmorphophobia. Penile dysmorphophobia is related to body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (Text Revision) (DSM-IV-TR) as a condition marked by excessive preoccupation with an imaginary or minor defect in a facial feature or localized part of the body. BDD is different from Koro. In Koro, a patient is overcome with the belief that his penis is actively shrinking, and it may be in imminent danger of disappearing. Clinical literature indicates that these two psychological conditions should be separated during differential diagnosis.\n\nIn addition to differentiating Koro from body dysmorphic disorder, physicians also recommend that differential diagnosis separates Koro from physical urological abnormalities. For example, one physical disorder that causes loss of penile size is Peyronie's disease, where the tunica albuginea develops scar tissue that prevents the full expansion of an erection and causes flaccid penis retraction. Additionally, a buried penis is a normally developed penis, partially covered by the suprapubic fat which can be surgically removed.\n\nIn historical culture-bound cases, reassurance and talks on sexual anatomy are given. Patients are treated with psychotherapy distributed according to symptoms and to etiologically significant points in the past. Prognosis appears to be better in cases with a previously functional personality, a short history and low frequency of attacks, and a relatively uncomplicated sexual life.\n\nFor sporadic Western cases, careful diagnostic workup including searching for underlying sexual conflict is common. The choice of psychotherapeutic treatment is based on the psychiatric pathology found.\n\nIn China, traditional treatment based on the causes suggested by cultural beliefs are administrated to the patient. Praying to gods and asking Taoist priests to perform exorcism is common. If a fox spirit is believed to be involved, people may hit gongs or beat the person to drive it out. The person will receive a yang- or yin-augmenting Chinese medicine potion, usually including herbs, pilose antler (stag of deer) or deer tail, and tiger penis, deer penis, or fur seal penis. Other foods for therapy are pepper soup, ginger soup and liquor.\n\nAmong the Chinese, koro is confined to South China and the lower Yangtze Valley. A 1992 study of self-report questionnaires suggests that in the epidemic area of China, koro victims are mostly Han, male, young, single, poorly educated and fearful of supernatural forces and koro. The phenomenon is also found among oversea Chinese in Southeast Asia, especially Malaysia and Indonesia, and less frequently among the Malay and Indonesian inhabitants of the countries. Though there are speculations that the occurrence of koro among people in Malaysia and Indonesia was the result of Chinese migrants, this cultural diffusion view is challenged since koro epidemics have been reported in Thailand and India, involving masses of non-Chinese people.\n\nSporadic cases of koro among people with non-Southeast-Asian ethnicity have been reported across the globe, for example, Nepali, Sudanese, Jordanian, Tanzanian, Nigerian, French, British, American and Canadian. In most of the non-Chinese cases in the Western hemisphere, genital shrinkage is reported but not all the other typical koro symptoms, such as fear of death, as in endemic countries. The incomplete forms of koro are regarded as the non-cultural forms, while the complete form with acute anxiety is the classical culture-bound type.\n\nLocal official records indicate genital retraction endemics in Hainan Island and Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong, China, as early as the late 19th century. There were a series of epidemic outbursts in 1948, 1955, 1966, and 1974, whenever there was social tension or impending disaster, followed by the last widespread episode in 1984–1985 and a much smaller outbreak in 1987. The 1984–1985 epidemics lasted for over a year and affected over 3,000 persons in 16 cities and provinces. A mental health campaign was conducted for the epidemic and since then no further episodes of the epidemic has occurred in China. Improvement in local economic conditions, associated with a better quality of life, is suggested to contribute to the fading of the episodic occurrences of koro.\n\nA koro epidemic struck Singapore in October 1967 for about ten days. Newspapers initially reported that some people developed koro after eating the meat of pigs inoculated with a vaccine for swine influenza. Rumours relating eating pork and koro spread after a further report of an inoculated pig dying from penile retraction. The cases reported amounted to 97 in a single hospital unit within one day, at five days after the original news report. Government and medical officials alleviated the outbreak only by public announcements over television and in the newspapers.\n\nAn epidemic outbreak in November 1976 in Isan, Thailand caused at least 350 cases, most of them Thai and males. Popular opinion and news media echoed the victims' projection of viewing the epidemic as caused by Vietnamese food and tobacco poisoning in a hideous assault against the Thai people. Another large-scale epidemic in Thailand occurred in 1982.\n\nIn 1982, a koro epidemic episode in Northeast India affected, in majority, poorly educated people from lower socio-economic strata. There was no evidence of significant premorbid or sexual psychopathology in most cases.\n\nMass Koro epidemic was reported in Labour Camps in Kochi, Kerala in South India during August and September 2010 among migrant labour population from North and North-east India. Reportedly, the epidemic spread to about 100 individuals in 3 labour Camps within 2 weeks.\n\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, newspapers reported incidents of genital shrinking in Western Nigeria. Since late 1996, a small-scale epidemic of genital shrinking was reported in West African nations. Victims in the African outbreaks often interpreted the experience as genital theft, accusing someone with whom they had contact of \"stealing\" the organ and the spiritual essence, causing impotence. The perceived motive for theft was associated with local occult belief, the witchcraft of juju, to feed the spiritual agency or to hold the genital for ransom. Social representations about juju constitute consensual realities that propose both a means and motivation for genital-shrinking experience.\n\nThe epidemic began in Nigeria and Cameroon, and spread to Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal by 1997. Cases were reported in Cotonou, Benin where mobs attacked individuals accused of the penis theft and authorities ordered security forces to curb the violence, following the deaths of five people by vigilantes. Later reports of outbreak suggest a spread beyond West Africa, including the coverage of episodes in Khartoum, Sudan in September 2003; Banjul, Gambia in October 2003; and Kinshasa, DR Congo in 2008.\n\nComparing West African genital-shrinking epidemics with koro in Southeast Asia, the latter has symptoms centered on genital retraction (instead of shrinkage) and fear of death (which is absent in African cases). A study analyzing the West African epidemics from 1997 to 2003 concluded that rather than psychopathology, the episodes were product of normal psychological functioning in undisturbed individuals, who were influenced by the local cultural models or social representations.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages in Europe, it was believed that men could lose their penises through magical attacks by witches. The \"Malleus Maleficarum\", a 15th-century European manual for witchcraft investigations, relates stories of men claiming that their genitals had disappeared, being \"hidden by the devil … so that they can be neither seen nor felt.\" They were said to have reappeared after the men had appeased the witches responsible. Witches were said to store the removed genitals in birds' nests or in boxes, where \"they move themselves like living members and eat oats and corn\".\n\nAt least three publications of the 1880s, from U.S., Russia and England, reported genital retraction pathology, without using the Malay or Chinese term. Koro epidemics in China were first noticed in a French report in 1908 and descriptions of koro entered clinical books of western medicine in 1936. In the 1950s, koro is noted in nosological and diagnostic psychiatry.\n\nMost of the ancient literature concerning koro was related to Chinese ethnic groups. For example, koro (in its Chinese term of \"shuk yang\") is documented in the old medical book \"New Collection of remedies of value\" () which was published in Qing Dynasty. The book described the condition as \"yin type of cold qi invasion\" () which involved a sudden seizure during sexual intercourse with the penis retracting into the abdomen. It asserts that the patient will die if not treated with \"heaty\" drugs in time.\n\nFactors of cultural expectation in the genesis of koro can be built upon ideas of sex physiology in the traditional Chinese medicine, with free play of imagination which links fatality with genital retraction.\n\nIn the ancient Chinese medical book \"Zhong Zang Jing\" (), retraction of the penis with distension of the abdomen was described as a certain sign of death. The yin and yang theory proposes that an unbalanced loss of the yang humour produces genital shrinkage.\n\nIn Taoism and Traditional Chinese medicine, frequent ejaculation is regarded as detrimental to health, as semen is considered to be related to a man's vital energy, and hence excessive depletion of semen may lead to illness or death. Some authors believe that the idea of death caused by the semen depletion resembles the idea of death caused by genital disappearance, although such linkage between koro and Taoism, which influences Chinese medicine to some degree, is only speculative.\n\nThe popularity of Chinese folklore also plays a role. The novel about ghost stories \"Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio\" describes a fox spirit which can make people weak physically and sexually and shrink their tissues. Belief in koro being caused by the fox ghost among the southern Chinese has been reported.\n\nThe earliest Western reference to the term \"koro\" is found in B.F. Matthes' \"Dictionary of Buginese Language\" (1874) of South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The name could derived from a river, its surrounding valley, and a local tribe of the same name which is located at northwestern sector of Sulawesi, Indonesia. The word is also used in Makassarese language, meaning \"to shrink\"; the full expression is \"garring koro\". Koro may also be derived from Malay term \"Kura\" which means \"head of turtle\" or \"keruk\" which means \"to shrink\". The term \"shuk yang\" (缩阳), adapted from Chinese, means \"the shrinkage of penis\". The term \"koro\" is also known as \"rok loo\" (genital shrinkage disease) in Thailand, \"jinjinnia bemar\" in Assam, India, and \"lanuk e laso\" by Bogoba tribe in Philippines.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36367419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36367419", "title": "Ku Klux Klan titles and vocabulary", "text": "Ku Klux Klan titles and vocabulary\n\nKu Klux Klan nomenclature has evolved over the order's nearly 160 years of existence. The titles and designations were first laid out in the original Klan's prescripts of 1867 and 1868, then revamped with William J. Simmons' Kloran of 1916. Subsequent Klans have made various modifications.\n\nThe sources of the rituals, titles and even the name of the original KKK may be found in antebellum college fraternities and secret societies such as the Kuklos Adelphon. John Lester, one of the original members of the group, stated that the Klan rituals were \"modeled on and embraced the leading features of the rituals of an order which has long been popular in many colleges and universities under various names\" such as the Sons of Confucius or Guiasticutus but always styled Ancient and Honorable and Mirth-Provoking. Walter L. Fleming stated in a footnote to Lester's text that the contemporary (early twentieth century) Southern college fraternity that most nearly mirrored the early Klan was Alpha Sigma Sigma and the institution of snipe hunting.\nThe original prescript of the Ku Klux Klan was adopted by a convention in Nashville, Tennessee in April 1867. A slightly revised edition appeared the next year.\n\nIn both prescripts there were four levels or \"departments\" of organization, above the basic level:\n\n\nIn the first prescript each officer is given the power to appoint Deputies to organize Realms, Dominions, Provinces and Dens until the latter can elect their own officers. The Grand Wizard was to be elected by a majority of Grand Dragons, and each lower level was elected by a majority of the next lower level of officers (Dragons elected by Titans, Titans by Giants etc.), as soon as three units had been formed at each level (three Dominions within a Realm for Grand Dragon, three Provinces within a Dominion for Grand Titan etc.). In the second prescript each officer appoints the lower officer with the approval of his superior.\n\nThe Dens were the basic level of organization for the Reconstruction Klan. In the original prescript, its chief officer was the Grand Cyclops, who appointed two Nighthawks, a Grand Turk, a Grand Sentinel, Grand Magi and a Grand Ensign in addition to his Grand Scribe. The Grand Cyclops, Grand Exchequer, Grand Magi (second officer) and Grand Monk (third officer) were elected by the body politic of the dens, identified as Ghouls In the second prescript the Grand Ensign is dispensed with, while the Grand Exchequer was appointed by the Grand Cyclops, who was now appointed by the Grand Giant. Only the Grand Magi and Grand Monk were elected by the Ghouls.\n\nThe exact function of these officers and the meaning of the titles varied. The two Nighthawks have been identified as couriers. The Grand Sentinel was in charge of the \"Grand Guard\", an organization which is not otherwise elaborated upon in the prescripts, but apparently served as the Den's security detail. The Grand Turk was the den's \"executive officer\" and was charged with informing Klansmen of \"all informal or irregular meetings\" and helping the Grand Cyclops and the Grand Magi maintain the \"control and government\" of the Den. The Grand Ensigns job was to take care of the Klan's flag.\n\nThe organ for initiation into the Klan was called the Investigating Committee, composed of the Grand Cyclops, Grand Magi and Grand Monk. Upon the nomination of a new member by a current member, the committee would investigate the candidate's \"antecedents and his past and present standings and connections\" and would then pronounce the candidate \"competent and worthy\" to become a member. The Grand Turk would escort the candidate to an \"outpost\" where he would question him and administer a preliminary oath. After this the Grand Turk would conduct the candidate to the Den, where the Grand Cyclops would administer the final oath. The second prescript elaborates that the candidate must have his left hand on the Bible and his right hand toward heaven and includes a ten-point \"interrogation\" that the candidate must answer satisfactorily in order to proceed with the final oath. The questions asked included: are you now or have ever been a member of the Radical Republican Party, Loyal Leagues or Grand Army of the Republic? Did you fight with the Union Army during the Civil War? Do you believe in Negro equality? among other things.\n\nA system of \"judiciary\" organs was created in each prescript. In the first the judiciary was divided into a Grand Council of Yahoos, to try officers of the Klan, and a Grand Council of Centaurs to try regular Ghouls. In Art.IV Sec.4, the Grand Giant is charged with conducting the Council of Yahoo, but Art.VI Sec.2 states that the Council will be composed of officers of the equivalent rank as the accused and presided over by an officer of the next higher rank. A trial of the Grand Wizard would be held by a meeting of all the Grand Dragons, the most senior Grand Dragon presiding It is unclear if these tribunals were ever functional.\n\nThe second prescript presented an entirely different judiciary, with officers of the first three levels tried by three judges, appointed by the chief officer of the given jurisdiction, and the officers and attaches of the headquarters (presumably the Genii, Hydras, and Furies). Trials of Den officers would be conducted at the provincial headquarters and include five judges, and ordinary ghouls to be tried at their dens with seven judges. As before a trial of the Grand Wizard would be conducted by the most senior Grand Dragon, this time with a quorum of seven dragons. All defendants had the right of appeal to the next higher court, and the proceeding was to be governed as \"ordinary court martials\".\n\nIn addition to the structure outlined above, there are documented cases of organs of slightly different nomenclature from Reconstruction. For instance, a group of twenty men who were arrested on April 6, 1868, at their \"den\" at the corners of Beale Street and Hernando street in Memphis, was called the Supreme Cyclopean Council. The constitution that the police captured outlined an organization with a Grand Cyclops, Vice-Grand Cyclops, and Secretary and openly advocated assassination of the \"murders and robbers\" now ruling the South. Members were bound to participate in the activities of the order, even if it meant leaving the \"embraces\" of their wife. A Grand Klan, composed of delegates from Spartanburg, York, Union, and Chester counties in South Carolina and a few from North Carolina met in Spartanburg, South Carolina and declared that no more raids or whippings would be conducted by members of the Klan except by their order and that the penalty for violating this order would be 100 lashes for the first offense and death for the second.\n\nAn attempt was apparently made to make Ghoul titles for other officers in Maury County, Tennessee in 1867 and early 1868, but the result was only confusion. Additionally a \"Grand Tycoon\" notified Klansmen in Lebanon, Tennessee to cease night riding and the order was apparently effective in restoring calm to Wilson County, Tennessee. In some early reconstruction Klan units there was also a Lictor, whose role as a guard of the den was later subsumed by the Nighthawks.\n\nThe Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. which existed from 1915 to 1944, elaborated on the original prescript in its Kloran and in the constitution and by-laws adopted in 1922. Some titles and jurisdictional designations were carried over from the Reconstruction prescripts intact or slightly modified, and others were original with Imperial Wizard Simmons.\n\n\nThere was a nearly identical set of subordinate officers at each level:\n\nThe officers at each level above the local Klan unit were designated by a unique prefix: Imperial at the Empire level; Grand at the Realm level; and Great at the Province level. Thus, for instance, an Imperial Kludd would be the chaplain for the whole organization, a Grand Kludd for the Realm, Great Kludd for a Province and simply Kludd for a local Klan.\n\nNot all offices were reproduced at each level. The Kladd, Klarogo, Klexter, and Klokard were not present at the Province level, and the Kladd was not included on the Realm level. The Klazik, second vice-president, and Klonsul, attorney, positions only existed at the Imperial level. The Klazik's duties included being head of the department of Realms and organizing new Realms and Provinces At the Province level there were three Klaliffs that served as an advisory board. A Klokann of three members, each one named a Klokan, filled this role at the local levels and a Klokann of four members at the Imperial level, in which they served as a \"Supreme Board of Auditors and Special Advisers and was led by a Chief Imperial Klokan.\n\nThe Imperial Wizards Genii constituted his Imperial Kloncilium; this was the Imperial Wizards supreme advisory board, as well as the Klans highest administrative organ in between Klonvokations. It met regularly every July, but could also be called when the Imperial Wizard or five Geniis petitioned him to do so. The Kloncilium was also the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of the organization with appellate jurisdiction and the right to finally determine disputes between Realms, Provinces, Klans and members in unorganized states\n\nGiant was adopted as an emeritus title: Imperial Giant for an ex-Imperial Wizard, Grand Giant for an ex-Grand Dragon, Great Giant for ex-Great Titan and Klan Giant for an ex-Exalted Cyclops.\n\nA Kleagle was a recruiter and was responsible for organizing local Klans.\n\nSince the dissolution of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. in 1944, there have been many Klan groups. Details of the nomenclature have varied, somewhat, among the different groups, but some terms have had more currency than others. Over time, the term klavern replaced klan for local groups. Imperial Wizard and Grand Dragon have still been generally used for the leader of a Klan organization and for state (realm) leaders. Exceptions included cases of one state Klans, such as the Association of Georgia Klans, whose leader Dr. Samuel Green, kept the title Grand Dragon until shortly before his death. The White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan created some innovations in their organization including a bicameral Klongress with an upper house Klonvokation and lower Klanburgess.\n\nIn the late 1970s David Duke's Knights of the Ku Klux Klan dropped the Imperial Wizard title, and the leader was called national director. That organization, now known as the Knights Party, no longer uses most of the traditional Klan titles, and the only fraternal titles used are Page, Squire and Knight for levels of membership.\n\nAside from titles and geographical designations, a distinctive vocabulary has grown around the Ku Klux Klan organizations. These include names for rituals, code words, and practices of the various Klans.\n\n\nThere are terms related to membership and non-membership:\n\nGroups of Klansmen commissioned for \"special activities\"\n\n\n\nTwo KKK codes for dates and times have been developed, the Ku Klux Register in the original prescripts and the Kalender developed by William J. Simmons.\n\nIn the original prescripts the register contained twelve designations, thought to correspond to months:\n\nThe second prescript had a slightly different scheme.\n\nColors were used for the days of the week:\n\nTwelve designations were used for the hours of the day:\n\nThe Kalender developed by W. J. Simmons included codes for days of the week, weeks, months and years. For months:\n\nFor weeks and days:\n\nYears were reckoned according to reigns and cycles. The Reign of Incarnation and Incantation was all time up to the American Revolutionary War. The First Reign of our Incarnation and Incantation was the period between the Revolution and the establishment of the original Klan, which was reckoned to May 6, 1866 in this scheme. The Reign of our Second Incarnation and Incantation was reckoned between 1866 and Grand Wizard Nathan Bedford Forrest's dissolution of the Klan, which is reckoned to 1872. The Reign of our Third Incarnation and Incantation began in 1915. The Klan year, Anno Klanslar, began in March of each year, and the cycle was reckoned from December of each calendar year.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "240949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240949", "title": "Markovnikov's rule", "text": "Markovnikov's rule\n\nIn organic chemistry, Markovnikov's rule or Markownikoff's rule describes the outcome of some addition reactions. The rule was formulated by Russian chemist Vladimir Markovnikov in 1865.\n\nThe rule states that with the addition of a protic acid HX to an asymmetric alkene, the acid hydrogen (H) gets attached to the carbon with more hydrogen substituents, and the halide (X) group gets attached to the carbon with more alkyl substituents. Alternatively, the rule can be stated that the hydrogen atom is added to the carbon with the greatest number of hydrogen atoms while the X component is added to the carbon with the least number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe same is true when an alkene reacts with water in an addition reaction to form an alcohol which involve formation of carbocations. The hydroxyl group (OH) bonds to the carbon that has the greater number of carbon–carbon bonds, while the hydrogen bonds to the carbon on the other end of the double bond, that has more carbon–hydrogen bonds.\n\nThe chemical basis for Markovnikov's Rule is the formation of the most stable carbocation during the addition process. The addition of the hydrogen ion to one carbon atom in the alkene creates a positive charge on the other carbon, forming a carbocation intermediate. The more substituted the carbocation, the more stable it is, due to induction and hyperconjugation. The major product of the addition reaction will be the one formed from the more stable intermediate. Therefore, the major product of the addition of HX (where X is some atom more electronegative than H) to an alkene has the hydrogen atom in the less substituted position and X in the more substituted position. But the other less substituted, less stable carbocation will still be formed at some concentration, and will proceed to be the minor product with the opposite, conjugate attachment of X.\n\nMechanisms that do not involve a carbocation intermediate may react through other mechanisms that have other regioselectivities not dictated by Markovnikov's rule, such as free radical addition. Such reactions are said to be anti-Markovnikov, since the halogen adds to the less substituted carbon, the opposite of a Markovnikov reaction. Similar to a positive charged species, the radical species is most stable when the unpaired electron is in the more substituted position. The anti-Markovnikov rule can be illustrated using the addition of hydrogen bromide to propene in the presence of benzoyl peroxide. The reaction of HBr with substituted alkenes was prototypical in the study of free-radical additions. Early chemists discovered that the reason for the variability in the ratio of Markovnikov to anti-Markovnikov reaction products was due to the unexpected presence of free radical ionizing substances such as peroxides. The explanation is that HBr produces a Br radical, which then reacts with the double bond. Since the bromine atom is relatively large, it is more likely to encounter and react with the least substituted carbon since this interaction procedure less static interactions between the carbon and the bromine radical. In this case the terminal carbon is a reactant which produces a primary addition product instead of a secondary addition product, in the case of propene.\n\nA new method of anti-Markovnikov addition has been described by Hamilton and Nicewicz, who utilize aromatic molecules and light energy from a low-energy diode to turn the alkene into a cation radical.\n\nAnti-Markovnikov behaviour extends to more chemical reactions than additions to alkenes. Anti-Markovnikov behaviour is observed in the hydration of phenylacetylene by auric catalysis, which gives acetophenone; although with a special ruthenium catalyst it provides the other regioisomer 2-phenylacetaldehyde:\n\nAnti-Markovnikov behavior can also manifest itself in certain rearrangement reactions. In a titanium(IV) chloride-catalyzed formal nucleophilic substitution at enantiopure 1 in the scheme below, two products are formed – 2a and 2b. Due to the two chiral centers in the target molecule, the carbon carrying chlorine and the carbon carrying the methyl and acetoxyethyl group, four different compounds are to be formed: 1R,2R- (drawn as 2b) 1R,2S- 1S,2R- (drawn as 2a) and 1S,2S- . Therefore, both of the depicted structures will exist in a D- and an L-form. :\n\nThis product distribution can be rationalized by assuming that loss of the hydroxy group in 1 gives the tertiary carbocation A, which rearranges to the seemingly less stable secondary carbocation B. Chlorine can approach this center from two faces leading to the observed mixture of isomers.\n\nAnother notable example of anti-Markovnikov addition is hydroboration.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55981105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55981105", "title": "Māori phonology", "text": "Māori phonology\n\nMāori phonology is typical for Polynesian languages, its phonetic inventory is one of the smallest in the world with considerable variation in realisation. The Māori language retains the Proto-Polynesian syllable structure: (C)V(V(V)), with no closed syllables. The stress pattern is unpredictable unlike many other Polynesian languages.\n\nThe sound system of Māori is conservative; it is close to the system the Proto-Central Eastern Polynesian language had. Most have 10 consonant and 5 vowel phonemes. The most unstable phonemes are /f/ and /ŋ/.\n\nDespite the widely-held belief that the Māori phonetic system is simple and straightforward, in reality the realisation of Māori phonemes differs significantly; it depends on the speaker's age, the chosen register and other factors.\n\nThe most frequent Māori phonemes are /a/ (18%), /i/ (11,3%), /t/ (9,8%). In an average text, vowels make up slightly more than 60 per cent of all the phonemes. Several combinations are extremely rare: /fo/, /fu/; also /wo/ and /wu/ can only be found in loanwords. The reason for the first two combinations to become rare is that *f + \"rounded vowel\" got merged with *s > /h/; the second pair was not attested in any reconstructions of the Proto-Polynesian language.\n\nAn unusual feature of Māori is the lack of sibilants, the most frequently encountered type of fricative consonants, as well as the lack of which is the most widespread semivowel phoneme in world languages.\n\nUnvoiced phonemes, /h/, and fricative allophones of /t/ and /k/ are sporadically voiced in fast speech. Devoicing of sonorants has also been attested in the same environment.\n\nIn loanwords, /h/ affects surrounding vowels by making them more close.\n\nThe realisation of /t/ and /k/ can be palatalised or velarised; /t/ before /i/ and /u/ changes to an affricate, , especially if it occurs in the last syllable of the phrase. Starting from the 19th century both /t/ and /k/ are increasingly aspirated. The article \"te\" can be pronounced as in unstressed environment. Sometimes /k/ is voiced to /ɣ/ in unstressed sylables.\n\nThe place of articulation of /h/ is affected by the following vowel: \"hī\" “fish” is pronounced as , but in \"hoa\" “friend” /h/ becomes labialised.\n\nMost speakers pronounce /f/ as , but historically dominated; the realisations and also occurred (see #Historical phonology).\n\nThe /r/ phoneme is most frequently realised as , sometimes it is pronounced as (in \"kōrero\" “speech”) and ; according to 19-century data, it was common for the dialects of the South Island, but occurs everywhere.\n\nThe number of phonemes is small, so their realisation varies considerably.\n\nPhrase-final vowels can be reduced. This is especially true for short vowels, but it happens to long ones as well in fast speech.\n\nLike in New Zealand English, the Māori phonemes /u/ and /uː/ are closer to central vowels, that is, .\n\nFor Māori monophtongs there are minimal pairs differentiated by vowel length:\n\nLong vowels are pronounced for approximately twice as long as their short counterparts.\n\nSome linguists consider long vowels to be variants of the short ones, while others count them separately. The second approach is supported by the difference in quality between them: the long vowels are more centralised.\n\nBeside monophthongs Māori has many diphthong vowel phonemes. Although any short vowel combinations are possible, researchers disagree on which combinations constitute diphthongs. Formant frequency analysis distinguish /aĭ/, /aĕ/, /aŏ/, /aŭ/, /oŭ/ as diphthongs.\n\nMāori phonotactics is often described using a term 'mora' which in this context is a combination of a short vowel and a preceding consonant (if present). Long vowels and diphthongs are counted as two moras. With these units it is easier to set up boundaries for reduplication, define allomorphs for some particles, and it also might be important to define the poetic meter of Māori poetry.\n\nFor example, when the word \"ako\" “to learn” is reduplicated, the resulted word \"akoako\" “give or take counsel” has the first syllable stressed, while the reduplication of \"oho\" “to wake up” -- \"ohooho\" “to be awake” -- often has the second syllable stressed. The reason is that /oa/ in the first example is a sequence of short vowels while /oo/ forms a single syllable peak.\n\nMost Polynesian languages stress the second to last mora of the word, but Māori stress is following many elaborate rules, which still remain not thoroughly understood.. One of the rules requires assigning hierarchy to syllables, and if more than one syllable receives the highest rank, the first one gets stressed:\n\nIn addition to word stress, Māori has phrasal stress that falls on the second to last mora:\n\nThis rule can also be applied to words that were formed by adding productive passive and nominalisation suffixes:\n\nIn reduplicated words, the first syllable of the repeated sequence has primary stress while the secondary stress falls on the first syllable of the second reduplication:\n\nThe first syllable of the prefix \"whaka-\" “to cause something” is never stressed, but if it is added to a word starting with a vowel and forms a diphthong or a long vowel, the resulting syllable moves higher in the syllable hierarchy and might get stressed: \"whakaputa\" “to emerge; to publish”, but \"whakaako\" “to teach”.\n\nLoanwords from English do not follow the rules at all. Many researchers mention considerable variation in stress patterns.\n\nReconstructions assume that Proto-Oceanic language had 23 consonant phonemes, and only 13 remained in Proto-Polynesian language: unvoiced and voiced stop consonants that contrasted in Proto-Oceanic merged, only two nasal consonants remained, two more consonants disappeared completely, but at the same time Proto-Polynesian acquired vowel length distinction. Māori retains all five Proto-Oceanic vowels. From a phonotactic standpoint, Proto-Polynesian lost consonant clusters and syllable-final consonants, although their reflexes can still be found: the passive form of the word \"inu\" “to drink” is \"inumia\", from *inum + ia. Proto-Polynesian *ʔ and *h disappeared in Māori, while *l and *r got merged into /r/ (the disappearance of /h/ and /l/-/t/ merger are typical innovations that can be found among the Nuclear Polynesian languages, and the disappearance of /ʔ/ is typical for Proto-Central Eastern Polynesian languages.\n\nNB: /w/ is a very rare reflex of *f that is attested in five words as *faf became /wah/.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Proto-Polynesian *f > /h/ before labialised vowels, but is preserved as /f/ initially before non-labialised vowels. Exceptions are likely reflecting that the merge of *f and *s took considerable time. The /f/ ~ /h/ variation is also seen in dialects: *fea > /fea/ in western dialects of the North Island, but /hea/ in eastern dialects.\n\nMany homophones were formed due to the phonetic inventory shrinking: for example, the word \"tau\" “suitable” and the word \"tau\" “season” are stemming from Proto-Polynesian *tau and *taʔu, respectively. Another consequence of this change is the frequent occurrence of long vowels: Proto-Polynesian *kehe > \"kē\".\n\nMāori retains all the vowels Proto-Oceanic language had, but they underwent systematic changes:\n\nOne of the many examples of irregular changes that happened in Māori is Proto-Polynesian *lima “hand” > Māori /riŋa/, although a related word *lima “five” turned into /rima/ in Māori; another one is a change from Proto-Eastern-Polynesian *aanuanua “rainbow” > ānuanua in Tahitian while becoming āniwaniwa in Māori.\n\nMāori has many doublets like /raŋo/ = /ŋaro/ (from Proto-Polynesian *laŋo) and /pouaru/ (North Island) = /poueru/ (South Island). Many of them occur due to metathesis, or the rearranging of sounds. In Māori's case metathesis switches adjacent vowels, consonants or syllables; in addition to that there exists a rare type of metathesis that involves sound features instead of segments: in tenga ~ kenakena “Adam's apple” the consonants' place of articulation changes while retaining nasality; in inohi ~ unahi “scales” the subject of metathesis is the vowel labialisation, but not the vowel height. Some morphemes have allomorphs: for example, the prefix /ŋaːti/ changes to /ŋaːi/ if it is preceding a word that starts with /t/: /ŋaːti porou/, but /ŋaːi tahu/; the same can be observed for /motu/ (“island”): /\"mou\"tohoraː/, Moutohora Island.\n\nMāori has undergone several notable sound changes during the last 200 years, most likely under the influence of New Zealand English phonetic system: \"wh\" changed from [ɸ] to [f]; stop consonants /p/, /t/, /k/ acquired aspiration; /əʊ/ and /oʊ/ merged. Linguists studied several recordings of Māori and English speakers of different ages, that had been made in 1940s by the New Zealand Broadcasting Service, and concluded that the change indeed took place. As an example, the results for \"wh\" can be found below:\n\nThe number of aspirated /p/, /t/, /k/ gradually increased, this change is also evident in recordings of speakers of different age:\n\nAlthough modern Māori has largely been standardised around the form which was primarily formerly found in the central North Island, historically regional variations did exist, one of which — Southern Māori — has been revived to a very limited extent. This dialect displays marked phonological variations, notably in the existence of apocope. Several consonants are also changed in this dialect, with replacing , replacing , and used in place of in some areas.\n"}

Very little is known about the ancient history of the language; linguists such as Dr. David Zorc and Dr. Robert Blust speculate that the Tagalogs and other Central Philippine ethno-linguistic groups had originated in Northeastern Mindanao or the Eastern Visayas.\n\nOld Tagalog is one of the Central Philippine languages, which evolved from the Proto-Philippine language, which comes from the Austronesian peoples who settled in the Philippines, 2000 years ago. This is the language of Ma-i, Tondo, Maynila, Namayan, and other regions of Central Luzon.\n\nThe early history of the Tagalog language remains relatively obscure, and a number of theories exist as to the exact origins of the Tagalog peoples and their language. Most scholars suggest that the Tagalogs originated in North-eastern Mindanao or the Eastern Visayas. The first written record of Tagalog is the Laguna Copperplate Inscription which dates to 900 CE, and exhibits fragments of the language along with Sanskrit, Malay, Javanese and Old Tagalog. The first known complete book to be written in Tagalog is the \"Doctrina Christiana\" (Christian Doctrine), printed in 1593.\n\nThe question has been raised about the origin of some words in the various dialects of the Philippines and their possible connection to ancient Buddhist and Hindu culture in the region, as the language is influenced by Sanskrit, Malay, Tamil and Chinese.\n\nOld Tagalog was written in Baybayin, which belongs to the Brahmic family of scripts. Loanwords from Malay and Sanskrit were written in the Kawi script because they could not be represented in Baybayin.\n\nAs in most Austronesian languages, the Sanskrit vocabulary incorporated into Tagalog are mostly borrowed indirectly via Malay or Javanese.

There, they discover that their supposed friend, the Magician, is the one responsible for the Moody Clouds. He secretly admires Mr. Dark, the villain of the original \"Rayman\", and was in fact behind the events that caused the Land of the Livid Dead forces to attack, preoccupying the heroes and using the Lums they gave him to power and use his diabolical machines. The Magician sends Rayman and his friends into a pit, but they escape and return to his office. The Magician then begins to dance and sends them into a dancing funk, using this as a good time to escape. The heroes chase after and fight the Magician in his escape airship, sending it crashing into the power source of his hideout. The resulting chain of events causes the hideout to explode, while Rayman and his friends free-fall back to the Snoring Tree, where they proceed to resume their relaxation.\n\nIf players manage to collect the ten ruby teeth throughout the game, they can gain access to the Land of the Livid Dead, where another monster awaits.\n\n\"Rayman Origins\" is a side-scrolling platformer, the same style as the original \"Rayman\" game. \"Rayman Origins\" is playable with up to four local players who may drop in or out at any time. Players can choose to control either Rayman, Globox or two Teensies, with additional costumes available as the game progresses.\n\nPlayers travel through each level, fighting enemies and rescuing imprisoned Electoons. As the game progresses, players gain new abilities such as running up walls, gliding in midair, swimming and shrinking in size to reach new areas. Certain segments also see players riding a mosquito, where players can shoot enemies or inhale and fire them. If a character is hit by an enemy or obstacle, they will \"bubblize\", or inflate into a ballooned state. To get out of this state, another player can slap, or jump on them, similar to \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\". Players can also collect hearts that will protect them from one hit. However, if all players are bubblized simultaneously, or if a character is hit during single play, they will explode and the play will return to the last checkpoint, normally a Darkblocker where the player had go through before, or the last place where the player broke a cage. Throughout each level, players can collect yellow Lums, which they will need for Electoons. When a character collects a Lum King, it turns all Lums red for a short time. Red Lums are worth two yellow Lums. There are also Skull Coins placed in hidden or dangerous areas. They are worth 25 Lums if successfully collected. If the player gets harmed while collecting a Skull Coin, they will lose it. In this situation, the player must try again to get the coin.\n\nIn order to progress through certain parts of the story, players need to free Electoons. The most common way to get Electoons is to free them from cages; there is one at the end of each level, with more to be found in hidden areas and are guarded by several enemies that collectively use a forcefield to protect the cage, the team must defeat every single enemy that uses the forcefield, then the cage can be destroyed. The cage can only be damaged on the side which has a green padlock. Most of the cages are hidden away in secret passages, so once the Electoons are free, they will create a portal which leads to the outside of these passages. Each level contains a medallion that shows how many Electoon challenges the players completed, such as break a single cage, collect a specific amount of Lums or beat the clock whilst the level has been completed. In every level there are hidden cages ranging from 1 to 3. More Electoons can be earned by collecting a certain amount of Lums within a level and clearing Time Trials that are unlocked after clearing a level once. Scoring high marks in either of these challenges can also earn medals and trophies. Players can also unlock special 'treasure chest' levels, in which they must chase a runaway treasure chest across a dangerous course in order to receive a skull tooth. Completing all of the teeth grants access to the bonus level, The Land of the Livid Dead.\n\nWhile every version of the game is nearly identical due to the game engine's high versatility, there are some minor differences across platforms. The Wii version of the game takes advantage of the versatility (though not the motion controls) of the Wii Remote to provide three different control schemes, while the Nintendo 3DS version displays the player's current progress during a particular level on the touchscreen. The PlayStation Vita version has some additional unlockable content, and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions support online achievements.\n\nThe game was officially announced at the end of Ubisoft's E3 2010 press conference as a downloadable episodic title for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade with release on PC, Nintendo 3DS, iPad, and iPhone \"to be considered\". The first episode was originally to be released by the end of 2010, but was delayed until 2011. Following a dearth of information in the new year, the project was confirmed as alive in April 2011. In May 2011, it was announced the title has been expanded to a full-retail title, with a tentative release of Q4 2011.\n\nThe game is the first title to use UbiArt Framework, an in-house graphics engine which allows artists to easily create content and then use it in an interactive environment. The artists only have to pose the model and edit the silhouette, as the software takes care of image distortion automatically. The main aim of this engine is to allow artists and designers focus on the art itself, without having to worry about technical aspects of game development. According to Yves Guillemot, only five people were working on the game when it was first announced. Ubisoft obtained a French government grant, dedicated to supporting the arts, for developing UbiArt tools. The engine is optimized for HD resolutions, allowing games to run in full 1080p HD at 60 frames per second. The engine was further developed for \"Rayman Legends\" to include dynamic lighting and integration of 3D models.\n\n\"Rayman Origins\" received widespread critical acclaim. Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the Wii version 92/100, the PlayStation Vita version 88/100, the Xbox 360 version 87/100 the PlayStation 3 version 87/100, the PC version 86/100, and the Nintendo 3DS version 71/100.\n\n\"1UP.com\" gave the game an A- Rank, praising its varied level design, saying \"Origins' brilliance is it keeps that simplicity on the surface, but ends up feeling incredibly varied thanks to its level design\", and calling it \"the best 2D platformer not called \"Mario\".\"\n\n\"Eurogamer\" rated the game 8/10, calling it \"a delightful, playful, and occasionally exhilarating platformer\" while opining that the level design was inferior to the \"Mario\" series in that \"the same ideas are repeated too often.\" GameTrailers gave the game a score of 8.5/10.\n\nIGN gave it a 9.5/10, saying that \"Rayman Origins is the best looking platformer this generation and also the most fun. A truly realized vision at the top of its genre, Rayman Origins is an extravaganza with plenty of action to keep it fresh from start to finish and beyond,\"\n\n\"Joystiq\" gave the game 5 stars out of 5, saying it \"embodies the kind of creativity and craftsmanship that have been largely missing in 2D platfomers since their heyday in the 16-bit era.\"\n\n\"Nintendo Life\" awarded it a 10/10 and called it \"The very pinnacle of 2D platforming and undoubtedly one of the Wii’s very best games\". \"Nintendo Power\" gave the game a score of 9.5/10, calling it 'a platforming masterpiece.'\n\nGameSpot named \"Rayman Origins\" \"Best Platformer of 2011\". IGN nominated \"Rayman Origins\" for \"Game Of The Year\". Giant Bomb named \"Rayman Origins\" the tenth best game of 2011.\n\nDespite the game's positive reviews, it didn't live up to its sales expectations having only sold 50,000 copies in its first month in the US. However, Ubisoft revealed that the game has been profitable.\n\nA sequel to \"Origins\", titled \"Rayman Legends\", was originally being developed exclusively for the Wii U and was planned for a release in Q1 2013. The game follows on from the gameplay of \"Origins\" whilst adding new asymmetric gameplay elements via the Wii U GamePad, as well as new characters and an improved graphics engine. The sequel was first hinted at via a marketing survey in April 2012. A leaked teaser video on YouTube confirmed the existence of the sequel, entitled \"Rayman Legends\". It was later announced that the sequel's release was being delayed until September 2013 and would also be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game was also revealed to be released on PlayStation Vita and Microsoft Windows via Steam.\n\nA mobile platformer developed by Pastagames based on the style of \"Origins\", titled \"Rayman Jungle Run\", was released on 20 September 2012 for iOS and on 27 September 2012 for Android devices. The Android version was developed by DotEmu. Retaining the look of \"Origins\", \"Jungle Run\" sees Rayman automatically running through 63 levels (plus 7 Land of the Livid Dead levels) with players tasked to jump and punch through obstacles and collect as many lums as possible in each stage. Collecting all 100 lums in each stage earns a skull tooth which go towards unlocking the Land of the Livid Dead level for each world. IGN gave the game a score of 8.8, calling it \"a brilliant solution to one-touch platforming.\" iTunes named it the iPhone game of the year. A version for Windows 8, Windows RT and Windows Phone was released on 7 March 2013. A sequel, \"Rayman Fiesta Run\", was released on November 7, 2013, featuring additional gameplay features carried over from \"Rayman Legends\".\n"}

Organisms' capability of reproduction leads to self-perpetuation of the species, if not to the individual. Populations self-perpetuate and grow. Entire ecosystems show homeostasis, and thus perpetuate themselves. The slow modifying effect of succession and similar shifts in the composition of the system can, however, not be neglected in the long run. Overall, life's object's capabilities of self-perpetuation are always accompanied by evolution, a perfect steady state of the biological system is never reached. Sexual reproduction is also a form of imperfect self-replication and thus imperfect self-perpetuation because of recombination and mutation. Organisms are not like self-replicating machine but amass random modifications from generation to generation. The property of self-perpetuation in the strict sense thus only applies to life itself.\n\nIn a social context, self-perpetuation is tied to reflexivity and (usually) positive feedback loops:\nDepending on the time scope or the context, self-perpetuation either depends on self-sustainability, or is equivalent to it. While we may talk about the self-sustainability of an ecosystem, this depends amongst other factor on the self-perpetuation of its constituting species.\n\nIn computer science, self-reproducing programs constitute an incomplete metaphor for self-perpetuation. A better analogue can be seen in computer viruses which are actually able to self-reproduce - given a suitable computing environment.\n\n"}

{"id": "12643590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12643590", "title": "Tampo", "text": "Tampo\n\nTampó, in Filipino culture, refers to a behavior in which a person withdraws his or her affection or cheerfulness from a person who has hurt his or her feelings.\n\nIn English \"sulking\" or \"to sulk\" is often considered the closest translation of tampo and there is also the term the silent treatment. The Malay-Indonesian equivalent is \"merajuk\".\n\n\"Tampo\" usually is manifested in the withdrawal of affectionate or cheerful behavior, and its expression is almost entirely nonverbal. These manifestations may include:\n\n\nThese are usually efforts to get the offending party to make amends, and if these behaviors do not work, one might choose to escalate them, perhaps to foot-stamping, door-slamming, or muttering.\n\nWhile these external manifestations may indeed sound like \"sulking\" in the western sense, the underlying cultural reason for them is what sets \"tampo\" apart. While sulking has strong negative connotations in western countries, \"tampo\" is quite acceptable among Filipinos. In fact, \"tampo\" has positive connotations for the Filipino, quite aside from the obvious negative ones.\n\nAs a cultural behavior, \"tampo\" springs from the nonconfrontational nature of Philippine social interaction. \"Tampo\" offers an acceptable means of expressing hurt feelings in a society in which direct expression of anger or resentment is discouraged. The withdrawal behaviors of tampo are indirect ways of expressing hostility. \"Tampo\" may also be seen as a means by which Filipinos \"save face\", as direct confrontation is usually a threat to the \"smooth interpersonal relationships\" (SIR) deeply valued in Philippine society.\n\nThe basic expectation of one who engages in \"tampo\" is that the offending party will woo or cajole him or her out of the feeling of being unhappy. The Tagalog word for this is \"amuhin\" or \"pagsuyo\". This wooing and cajoling is done in a loving and tender way, a gesture called \"lambing\".\n\nFor the offending party, the typical Philippine way of dealing with \"tampo\" is to respond to the offended party with friendly overtures or expressions of concern, after a short \"cooling-off\" period. Not to do this may cause relations, especially romantic ones, to deteriorate. In most instances in which \"tampo\" is engaged in, healing the inner, emotional relationship between two people is usually more critical than resolving the issue itself.\n\nPer the Asawa Guide to Fil-West Relationships, tampo \"is a mild behavioral reprimand that verges on role-playing. Tampo is mild and controlled and is the direct result of some perceived offense of a minor nature. It is short in duration. . . . Apologize for your bad behavior. Whether or not you’re guilty of the perceived 'crime' is irrelevant. The important thing is that your girlfriend or wife desires to be consoled. She has been wounded emotionally and requires emotional solace. Intellectual objections will have little effect, and may actually aggravate the condition. . . . After you apologize, allow the Filipina to lift the tampo slowly, at a respectable pace. Do not expect instant results. Do not continue apologizing, again and again, in an attempt to speed the tampo's demise. This will only make you look foolish, and it won't work. Keep your dignity, and let her keep hers. . . . Similarly, don’t accuse a Filipina of tampo – that will embarrass her, and would be a breach of etiquette on your part. Her job is to execute the tampo as best she can, and your job is to play along and make her feel better. . . . The old standby's are still effective: a romantic card, chocolate, jewelry. . .\"\n\nAs other Asians, Filipinos believe strongly in saving face. This is why a Philippine affirmative response to an invitation may actually mean \"maybe\" or even \"I don’t know\" instead of \"yes\" (Filipinos often have difficulty in bringing themselves to respond negatively, so one who issues a dinner invitation may wish to confirm it several times to ensure that the invited Filipino did not respond affirmatively simply because he could not find a proper way to say \"no\"). Tied to saving face are \"amor propio\", or \"self respect\", and \"hiya\", or \"shame\". A Filipino would be considered lacking in \"amor propio\" if, for example, he accepted criticism weakly or did not offer honored guests proper hospitality. \"Hiya\" is felt by those whose actions are considered socially unacceptable (one of the strongest insults in Philippine society is to be labeled \"walang-hiya\", or \"shameless\"). Each person is expected to have \"hiya\" and to win the respect of others by conforming to common behavioral norms. Those who change allegiances for personal convenience are seen as double-faced, or \"balimbing\" (after the many-sided fruit).\n\n\n"}

The Whale Caller first appears to be sexually attracted to whales; especially a whale he named Sharisha. As the story progresses, he meets a woman named Saluni, who falls deeply in love with the Whale Caller. Throughout the story, the Whale Caller constantly has internal conflicts. He tries to love Saluni, however he can not abandon the love he has toward his beloved whale, Sharisa.\n\n\"The Whale Caller\" begins with an introduction to the central core of the story by describing the Whale Caller’s ritual of blowing a special kelp horn to attract a whale he named Sharisha, a Southern Right whale. He longs for the whale’s presence, but it is nowhere in sight so he ventures to Mr. Yodd to express his pain. He confesses his love for Sharisha and adds in that he bought a tuxedo for the sole purpose of welcoming her back. After leaving Mr. Yodd’s grotto, the Whale Caller trips and injures his left knee. He explains that he sacrificed his knees in order to protect the special horn he was holding.\n\nNext, he opens up to his past by describing the origin of his ways beginning forty years earlier. His fascination with the kelp horn blown in church inspired him to learn to play it and eventually become the official horn player. Afterward, he becomes Chief Horn Player in a new church created that put heavy emphasis on using the kelp horn in service. During a baptism conducted near the ocean, the Whale Caller learns that the kelp horn affects the behavior of a whale. This urges the Whale Caller to believe he is communicating with the whale through his horn and becomes his obsession.\n\nHe describes where he lived after leaving the church in his home village in South Africa, and how things there have changed over the years. Population growth in addition to the vast increase in tourism turn the Whale Caller into an outcast. He despises the mobs of tourists who have no comparable knowledge to his about whales he wades through on a daily basis but notices one particular woman who seems to be everywhere he goes, and who always seems to be watching him.\n\nIt takes a while for the Whale Caller to speak to this woman but eventually he approaches Saluni, known as the village drunk, and has an uneventful conversation ending with her walking away. They meet a couple weeks later and pick up where the previous conversation leaves off by discussing whales and learning of their opposing views. The Whale Caller puts fourth his knowledge of whales for Saluni to interpret, but the outcome is the same as Saluni simply walks away. Saluni realizes her attraction to the Whale Caller and ventures to his Wendy House in response to his offer to cure her lice problem. She stays with the intention of never leaving and quits drinking in attempt to show her affection. Above her affection is her disapproval of the Whale Caller’s obsession with Sarisha. When she vocally bashes Sarisha to the Whale Caller, the Whale Caller leaves to be with Sarisha though this trek to be with Sarisha was different. The Whale Caller displayed his affection for Sarisha by getting sexually aroused with an audience and ending with Saluni showing up.\nThe Whale Caller’s relationship with Saluni continues to grow as she attempts to initiate him into a more civilized living style. The whales migrated over a month ago and Saluni feels like her life is fulfilled as she has the Whale Caller and the Bored Twins. She even tries to initiate sex with him but his mind becomes filled with images of whales, including Sharisha and he is unable to follow through.\n\nThe Whale Caller brings Saluni to Mr. Yodd and one day Saluni even goes there by herself in order to better understand the Whale Caller. One day they meet Lunga Tubu who has the voice of the Earth. One day, during a thunderstorm, Saluni and the Whale Caller finally consummate their relationship. Afterwards Saluni jokes that he could not have done that with Sharisha to which he replies 'You do not know that…'(97). As time goes on, Saluni and the Whale Caller continue to live together and Saluni rarely visits the Bored Twins anymore. But one day she goes to visit them and cures one of them of the flu. The Whale Caller finds that he does not know what to do on his own anymore and so the next day he goes to the Bored Twins home and finds Saluni to bring home.\n\nOne day they attempt to go eat at a restaurant but end up getting in a fight. For the next couple of days, the Whale Caller pampers her constantly. Saluni goes to visit Mr. Yodd and is told that Sharisha will be returning soon. A couple of days Saluni spots the first whale and rushes home to realize that the Whale Caller already knows that the whales are returning. She proceeds to follow him for three days to make sure he doesn’t go to the whales but then goes to visit the Twins. After a while she returns home to the house to find it locked and then rushes to the beach where she finds the Whale Caller in his tuxedo and with his horn. While there, the Whale Caller notices that Sharisha has been wounded by a boat.\n\nA new season begins and the whales return. The Whale Caller still spends his time watching Sharisha and her calf while Saluni attempts to catch his attention. Later Saluni comes up with a plan to have the Bored Twins use their beautiful singing voices for a radio station. The twins are excited but their parents are not and quickly shut the idea down again saying the machines will steal the children’s voices. During the night a blue moon occurs. The Whale Caller compares himself to it saying he misses Saluni. As he watches Sarisha and her calf Saluni arrives and approaches him. They talk again and the Whale Caller tells her the story of the origins of the whale’s blow holes. The next day Saluni is again determined to record the twins voices. She sneaks the Bored Twins to town. In the town they begin to sing and as they sing people begin to surround them and follow them. As they reach the studio the radioman is very impressed and sets an appointment for next week. She then returns to the Wendy house where the relationship she had with the Whale Caller is back. Some days not the Whale Caller forgoes watching the whales and instead fishes with Saluni. During one of these fishing days the Whale Caller lands a monstrous “kabeljou”. Saluni uses it to make money charging people to take a picture with it. Soon they make a business of it, catching fish and charging tourists or others to take a picture with it.\n\nIt is the day of an eclipse and Saluni and the Whale Caller fight because he wants to visit the whales. During the eclipse Saluni, upset at the Whale Caller’s obsession, looks directly at the eclipse and goes blind. Now that Saluni is blind the Whale Caller feels guilty and tells her that he will follow her and guide her. Saluni decides to leave town and they travel along the coastline. They meet up with a tiny poacher and continue on their way. After walking for many days they reach the Breede River and after that Swellendam.\n\nThe book skips and a freak wave hits Hermanus causing massive damage. After it is safe the Whale Caller returns to his house and begins to clean up the damage that has been done. Saluni also soon arrives. The two still have not talked and it is revealed that the Whale Caller called her ugly. The book then tells how Saluni got her sight back. She gets mad because the Whale Caller has lied to her about keeping the candle. She then accuses him of lying about other things and they walk the road silently. Saluni then accuses him of not caring and that is when he calls her ugly. After cleaning the house the Whale Caller goes and plays his horn out on the beach and plays it. He notices that Sharisha has been stranded on the beach. An emergency team comes and attempts to push Sharisha back into the water as the Whale Caller helplessly watches. As the Whale Caller watches Sharisha, Saluni watches him. As she watches the attempts to push her back in the water are in vain. Finally the scientists decide to kill the whale. After the whale is killed Saluni is filled with remorse. She feels guilty for Sharisha’s death and the Whale Callers pain and sorrow. She drowns her sorrows in alcohol and goes to visit the Bored Twins. One of the twins hurls a rock at her to keep her from running. It strikes the back of her head killing her. Later the Whale Caller returns to the place of the beaching. He visits Mr. Yod to discover he can no longer hear its voice. The book ends as he names himself the Hermanus Penitent.\n\nWhale Caller and Sharisha: As the protagonists of the novel, the Whale Caller is characterized as somewhat of a loner who awaits the return of the whale, Sharisha. For a few years now, the Whale Caller has developed an unexpected relationship with Sharisha, as he is in love with a whale. The Whale Caller is able to express his love for Sharisha by playing his kelp horn, which causes Sharisha to swim around the shoreline, making the Whale Caller content. The Whale Caller is aroused by Sharisha’s reaction to the kelp horn, and considers Sharisha to be an intimate partner. This strains his relationship with Saluni who struggles to create intimacy with the Whale Caller since he is preoccupied with Sharisha. Ultimately though, the Whale Caller remains faithful to Sharisha and appeasing Saluni, until their deaths at the end of the novel.\nSaluni: Classified as the ‘village drunk,’ Saluni always seems to lurk around town seeking the Whale Caller’s attention. She constantly references the fact that she is a ‘love child’ and therefore deserves the affection and admiration she was denied of as a child. Saluni however is forced to compete for the Whale Caller’s love with the whale, Sharisha. Saluni is able to create intimate moments with the Whale Caller, and in an attempt to fully capture the Whale Caller’s heart, she constantly confronts Sharisha, asking the whale to die or leave the Whale Caller. While never successful, she seeks affection from the Bored Twins on her semi-regular visits to their home. At the end of the novel though, Saluni is tragically murdered by the Bored Twins, whom she had tended to throughout the novel.\nBored Twins: Feral twins who are the daughters of two farm laborers’. Given their mental state, Saluni visits them during the day while their parents are in the fields. The Bored Twins have beautiful singing voices, which comfort Saluni during her times of depression. Saluni tries to record the twins’ voices for a recording company, but their mother is afraid that their voices will be stolen, forcing the twins to distance themselves from Saluni. At the end of the novel, as Saluni is leaving the twins’ house, they try to stop her by throwing rocks at her head, but they take it too far and accidentally kill her. Mda foreshadows Saluni’s death earlier in the novel when the twins would torture frogs and snakes, preparing the reader for the psychopathology of the murder.\nMr. Yodd: Dwells in a grotto with rock rabbits. Throughout the novel, the Whale Caller and Saluni turn to Mr. Yodd for confession. The Whale Caller confesses his love for Sharisha, and his concern that she might not return from her migration, while Saluni expresses her want to dispose of Sharisha in order to capture the Whale Caller’s love. During confessions, Mr. Yodd taunts the Whale Caller and Saluni by occasionally laughing, causing discomfort and self-mortification for both the Whale Caller and Saluni.\n\nComplexities of Love for Nature – Throughout the novel, The Whale Caller is infatuated with a southern right whale that he has named Sharisha. This is a complicated relationship because when one loves nature (something such a forest) one does not think that it can love us back, but in this case, Sharisha seems to respond to the Whale Caller’s affection. Mda makes the reader think about how the relationship with nature changes as we think of nature as being able to love us back; this complication affects the Whale Caller’s relationship with Saluni. For example, when the Whale Caller and Saluni are about to consummate their relationship, “…images of whales interfere at that moment of excitement and he goes limp” (74). This means that the Whale Caller is constantly thinking of Sharisha, even during his most intimate moments with Saluni. The Whale Caller also longs for Sharisha when she is away on migration. This love for Sharisha symbolizes the love normally only shared between two people.\n\nJealousy – The theme of jealousy is a prominent one in throughout the novel. The jealousy is mainly coming from Saluni and she is showing that jealousy towards Sharisha because Sharisha seems to get most of The Whale Caller’s attention. Saluni mentions the love triangle between The Whale Caller, Saluni, and Sharisha; Saluni does not want this triangle to exist. Saluni says “I can tell you I am not going to be part of any triangle. The fish must go!” (81). Saluni constantly tries to get the Whale Caller farther and farther away from Sharisha. For example, when they start their journey, Saluni wants them to take the side roads, that are away from the ocean, so that The Whale Caller does not think about Sharisha.\n\nBetrayal- Throughout the novel, there are references to betrayal among the major characters in the novel. Saluni always shows affection towards the Bored Twins and they do likewise, but there are times when they don’t. Ultimately, the Bored Twins betray her, which leads to her tragic death. Saluni starts running to go back to The Whale Caller and the twins try to slow her down by throwing rocks at her. When they see that this works, they make a game out of it and they continue throwing stones at her until they realize that she is no longer moving nor breathing.\n\nBlind Following – Throughout the novel, there are times in which people blindly follow others, without knowing the final destination and without knowledge of the purpose of the journey. After being blinded by the sun, Saluni goes on an adventure with The Whale Caller, and she literally blindly follows him wherever he leads her. This blind following represents Saluni’s thinking that her life is now pointless. She has lost her chance to be a Hollywood star and she believes that she has also lost The Whale Caller to Sharisha. During her journey, she made no progression and in the end, she returns the same person as she left.\n\nHermanus is the town where most of the story \"The Whale Caller\" takes place. It lies along the Walker Bay off the south coast of the Western Cape. Its fame comes from its great vantage points to watch Southern Right Whales during the spring and winter. Hermanus holds an annual Whale Festival at the end of September. Hermanus has what is believed to be the world's only Whale Crier. His job is to blow his kelp horn to announce where whales have been spotted.\n"}

The building has served as an event and meeting space since 1979, when it was purchased by the San Francisco Women's Center. The building is shielded from rising real estate costs in the Mission district because that group has owned the building since 1995. The four-story building rents to multiple tenants and serves over 20,000 women a year.\n\nThe structure was built in 1910 and was originally known as Turn Hall because it was part of the Turnverein exercise movement. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.\n\nThe San Francisco Women's Center began in 1973. By 1974, it hired its first full-time employee and had moved into a small storefront office. In 1976, its difficulty in locating a venue for the national conference on Violence Against Women it was organizing with other women's groups led it to search for a permanent space. Through 1978 and 1979, it raised funds to put down an initial $10,000 deposit, and then a $115,000 first payment towards the $535,000 purchase price of the building at 3543 18th Street. \n\nTracy Gary, one of the organizers of the Violence Against Women conference, and co-founder of the Women's Building, along with co-founder Marya Grambs and Women's Building staff member Carmen Vázquez, were interviewed in 1982 by Julia Randall for KPFA for the building's 3rd birthday. The women discuss the difficulties of the early years and how the building was being used in 1982. Roma Guy and her partner Diane were also two of the Women's Building's co-founders.\n\nIn the first year of operation, the Women's Building was targeted by two attacks: an arson fire that caused $50,000 worth of damage, and a pipe bomb set off on the front steps of the building.\n\nIn 1997, the Women's Building underwent a major renovation prompted by mandatory seismic retrofitting. In the course of that effort, it evicted the Dovre Club, a bar that had been in the corner of the building on 18th and Lapidge Streets since 1979. The original owner of that bar had an oral agreement with the Women's Center that the bar could stay in place during his lifetime; after his death in 1997, the bar made an effort to stay in place but ultimately relocated.\n\nPainted by seven women artists including, Juana Alicia, Miranda Bergman, Edythe Boone, Susan Kelk Cervantes (cofounder of Precita Eyes Muralists Association), Meera Desai, Yvonne Littleton and Irene Perez along with their helpers and volunteers in 1994, the mural titled \"MaestraPeace\" covers both the outside of The Women's Building as well as the interior entrance hall and stairway. It features images of feminine icons from history and fiction, and the names of more than 600 women written in calligraphy. According to the San Francisco Women's Center, \"This spectacular mural is a culmination of a multi-cultural, multi-generation collaboration of seven women artists, and a colorful work of art that sings to our community.\" \n\nMany of the original artists returned to the building for an update in 2000, an expansion to the inside of the building in 2010, and a major $130,000 restoration in 2012. That last restoration included a treatment process designed to preserve the colors of the mural for another 100 years.\n\n\n"}
