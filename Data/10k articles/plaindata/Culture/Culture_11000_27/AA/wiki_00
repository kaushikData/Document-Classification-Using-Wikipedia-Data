{"id": "8727967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8727967", "title": "African-American folktales", "text": "African-American folktales\n\nAfrican-American folktales are the storytelling and oral history of African American slaves during the 1700-1900s. Many are unique to the African-American culture, while others are influenced by African, European, and Native American tales.\n\nAfrican-American folktales are a storytelling tradition which started in Africa. They are a rich oral tradition which has grown and expanded as Africans were brought to the Americas as slaves. \n\nIn general, most African-American Folktales fall into one of seven categories: tales of origin, tales of trickery and trouble, tales of triumph over natural or supernatural evils, comical heart warming tales, tales teaching life lessons, tales of ghosts and spirits, and tales of slaves and their slave-owners. Many revolve around animals which have human characteristics with the same morals and short comings that humans do making the moral of the stories relatable. Many new tales were born out of the experiences of Africans in the Americas, but many of the tales have endured. Although many of the original stories have changed, being added to and evolving, since African Americans were brought to the Americas as slaves, their meaning and moral life lessons have remained the same.\n\nAfrican-American tales of origin include the stories that center around beginnings and transformations whether it is focused on a character, event, or generally explaining how the world came to be. Some examples of tales of origin includes \"How Jackal Became an Outcast\" and \"Terrapin's Magic Dipper and Whip\".\n\n\"How Jackal Became an Outcast\" was adapted from \"The Jackal and the Lion\", written by Joseph Cotter. It is told that this story was brought directly from Africa. In this tale, the Jackal takes the role of a trickster who tries to use their clever wit to outplay the Lion, which ends up backfiring because his lack of morality leads to disaster for both the Jackal and his future descendants.\n\n\"Terrapin's Magic Dipper and Whip\" was adapted from \"Negro Folk Tales from the South (Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana) by Arthur Huff Fauset. The storyteller of this tale (collected in the 1920s) is said to have been brought to Alabama as a slave after being born in West Africa. This folktale focuses on explaining the origin of a Tortoise named Terrapin's shell and its \"furtive behavior\" - it involves a plot \"in which a magical object provides an apparently unlimited food supply and another object dispenses beatings [which] is likely to be of European in origin...[this tale] suggests the creative merging of two folk traditions: African and European\".\n\nOverall, a tale of origin is a very common theme found within African-American folktales and helps explain how events and characters came to be.  \n\nTricksters in folk stories are commonly characters (people, animals, etc.) who 'succeed' off of deceiving others and taking advantage of their weaknesses.They usually don't think if their actions are right or wrong - they have been described as amoral. In stories, they tend to use their wits to get out of trouble and/or get what they want. Specifically in African-American folktales, two examples of common tricksters are Brer Rabbit and Anansi.\n\nTricksters in African American folktales tend to have a comedic approach. However, these stories also have an underlying important theme as well: inequality.The National Humanities Center says that, \"they contain serious commentary on the inequities of existence in a country where the promises of democracy were denied to a large portion of the citizenry, a pattern that becomes even clearer in the literary adaptations of trickster figures\". The trickster folktales reflect what was happening during that period of time.\n\nThese kinds of folktales didn't always have a literal 'trickster', but they had the overarching theme of using trickery tactics. For example, Charles Chesnutt's collected a series a stories and named it \"The Conjure Woman\" (1899). One of the stories found in this book includes a story of \"how an enslaved man is spared being sent from one plantation to another by having his wife, who is a conjure woman, turn him into a tree...the trickery works until a local sawmill selects that particular tree to cut\".\n\nIt was during these slavery times, \"and for decades thereafter, trickster tales, with their subtly and indirection, were necessary because blacks could not risk a direct attack on white society\".\n\nAfrican-American Tales of comical and heartwarming are told to “stimulate the imagination with wonders, and are told to remind us of the perils and the possibilities”. The heartwarming tales are told to lighten and stay connected. The stories commonly told are about heroes, heroines, villains and fools. One story, The Red Feather, is a response to the amalgamation of intertwining cultures ending with heroes bringing forth gifts. Other lighthearted stories include many examples with heroes. Rabbit Rides Wolf is a story told representing the amalgamation of African and Creek descent where another hero is emerged during a bitter time.\n\nAfrican folklore and tales are means of handing down traditions and duties through generations. Tales are often passed through word of mouth through family or gatherings of people. It was not uncommon for the people in Africa to gather children in groups, sit them down, and share the jarring tales that were once told to them. This kind of gathering was known as Tales by Midnight.\n\nTales by Midnight was supposed to share stories that could potentially prepare children for their futures. These gatherings were lessons to the youth of African. The tales were representations of their culture. Diverse kinds of animals would often have human-like characteristics to make the story compelling to the young children. This could be physical acts like singing and dancing, or it would be portrayals of emotion like greediness, honesty, loyalty, ect.\n\nThere were several tales that were commonly told in this Tales by Midnight setting. One for example was the tale of The Midnight Goat Thief. This tale originated from Zimbabwe, and has passed through many generations of African children.\n\nThe Midnight Goat Thief is a tale of misplaced trust and betrayal between two friends, a baboon and a hare. The relationship is under water when a conflict between the two arises. The story is supposed to teach youth to be loyal and honest.\n\nAfrican-American tales of ghosts and spirits were commonly told of spook or “haint” , in modern day known as “haunt,” a term referring to a repeated visits by ghosts or in tradition, tales of ghosts and spirits that keep one awake at night. Possessed of Two Spirits is a personal experience believing in the magic powers in conjuration with both the living and the spiritual world found commonly in African-American spirit folklore. Another story, Married to a Boar Hog emerged during the colonial Revolution against the British. The story is an example of a young woman who marries to a figure typically told as a supernatural being such as a boar and in the end her savior typically ends as her brother but with some form of disease [leprosy, club foot, or yaws]. In the midst of the revolution, \"Married to a Boar Hog\" is from slaves being carried to the British Caribbean but with reference to the African Origin about the hardships they endured.\n\nAfrican-American tales of slavery often uses rhetoric that can seem uncommon to the modern era. The language that is passed down through generations has deviated the standard for racial narrative. The Conjure Woman, a book of tales dealing with racial identity, was written by the first African-American author, Charles W. Chesnutt, in the perspective of a freed slave.\n\nThe folklore-styled tales within this book are a representation of the struggles that the slaves had to face during the post-war time period in the South. The author wrote them in order for readers to a gain perspective on the challenges of being left behind. Chestbutt’s stories were a pensive view of the times of slavery. The Conjure Woman tales were told by the freed slave from their owners who left the South after the war.  \n\nChesnutt's language surrounding African American folklore derived from the standards of the racial narrative of his era. By using vernacular language, Chesnutt was able to deviate from the racial norms and formulate a new, more valorized, message of folk heroes. “ Chesnutt writes \"on the other side\" of standard racial narratives, effectively refuting them by evoking a different kind of \"racial project\" in his fictional work.”\n\n"}

{"id": "4412043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4412043", "title": "Aniconism in Buddhism", "text": "Aniconism in Buddhism\n\nSince the beginning of the serious study of the history of Buddhist art in the 1890s, the earliest phase, lasting until the 1st century CE, has been described as aniconic; the Buddha was only represented through symbols such as an empty throne, Bodhi tree, a riderless horse with a parasol floating above an empty space (at Sanchi), Buddha's footprints, and the dharma wheel.\n\nAlthough there is still some debate, the first anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha himself are often considered a result of the Greco-Buddhist interaction, in particular in Gandhara, a theory first fully expounded by Alfred A. Foucher, but criticised from the start by Ananda Coomaraswamy. Foucher also accounted for the origins of the aniconic symbols themselves in small souvenirs carried away from the main pilgrimage sites and so becoming recognised and popularized as symbolic of the events associated with the site. Other explanations were that it was inappropriate to represent one who had attained nirvana.\n\nHowever, in 1990, the notion of aniconism in Buddhism was challenged by Susan Huntington, initiating a vigorous debate among specialists that still continues. She sees many early scenes claimed to be aniconic as in fact not depicting scenes from the life of the Buddha, but worship of cetiya (relics) or re-enactments by devotees at the places where these scenes occurred. Thus the image of the empty throne shows an actual relic-throne at Bodh Gaya or elsewhere. She points out that there is only one indirect reference for a specific aniconic doctrine in Buddhism to be found, and that pertaining to only one sect.\n\nAs for the archeological evidence, it shows some anthropomorphic sculptures of the Buddha actually existing during the supposedly aniconic period, which ended during the 1st century CE. Huntington also rejects the association of \"aniconic\" and \"iconic\" art with an emerging division between Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism. Huntington's views have been challenged by Vidya Dehejia and others. Although some earlier examples have been found in recent years, it is common ground that the large free-standing iconic images of the Buddha so prominent in later Buddhist art are not found in the earliest period; discussion is focused on smaller figures in relief panels, conventionally considered to represent scenes from the life of the Buddha, and now re-interpreted by Huntington and her supporters.\n\nIn later periods both the major schools of Buddhism have made great use of representational art, though Theravada temples and other sites typically concentrate on a single large sculpture of the Buddha, whereas Mahayana temples have larger numbers of images of a greater variety of figures with varying degrees of spiritual significance. However some schools, such as Zen Buddhism in Japan, have also shown a general tendency towards aniconism, though without specific prohibition of figurative images.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "342908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=342908", "title": "Anthropologist", "text": "Anthropologist\n\nAn anthropologist is a person engaged in the practice of anthropology. Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology, cultural anthropology, and philosophical anthropology study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life, while economic anthropology studies human economic behavior. Biological (physical), forensic, and medical anthropology study the biological development of humans, the application of biological anthropology in a legal setting, and the study of diseases and their impacts on humans over time, respectively.\n\nAnthropologists usually cover a breadth of topics within anthropology in their undergraduate education, and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the graduate level. In some universities, a qualifying exam serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of anthropology; the students who pass are permitted to work on a doctoral dissertation.\n\nAnthropologists typically hold graduate degrees, either doctorates or master's degrees. Not holding an advanced degree is rare in the field. Some anthropologists hold undergraduate degrees in other fields than anthropology and graduate degrees in anthropology.\n\nResearch topics of anthropologists include the discovery of human remains and artifacts as well as the exploration of social and cultural issues such as population growth, structural inequality, and globalization by making use of a variety of technologies including statistical software and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Anthropological field work requires a faithful representation of observations and a strict adherence to social and ethical responsibilities, such as the acquisition of consent, transparency in research and methodologies, and the right to anonymity.\n\nHistorically, anthropologists primarily worked in academic settings; however, by 2014, U.S. anthropologists and archaeologists were largely employed in research positions (28%), management and consulting (23%), and government positions (27%). U.S. employment of anthropologists and archaeologists is projected to increase from 7,600 to 7,900 between 2016 and 2026, a growth rate just under half the national median.\n\nAnthropologists without doctorates tend to work more in other fields than academia, while those while the majority of those with doctorates are primarily employed in academia. Many of those without doctorates in academia tend to work exclusively as researchers and do not teach. Those in research-only positions are often not considered faculty. The median salary for anthropologists in 2015 was $62,220. Many anthropologists report an above average level of job satisfaction.\n\nAlthough closely related and often grouped with archaeology, anthropologists and archeologists perform differing roles, though archeology is considered a sub-discipline of anthropology. While both professions focus on the study of human culture from past to present, archaeologists focus specifically on analyzing material remains such as artifacts and architectural remains. Anthropology encompasses a wider range of professions including the rising fields of forensic anthropology, digital anthropology, and cyber anthropology. The role of an anthropologist differs as well from that of a historian. While anthropologists focus their studies on humans and human behavior, historians look at events from a broader perspective. Historians also tend to focus less on culture than anthropologists in their studies. A far greater percentage of historians are employed in academic settings than anthropologists, who have more diverse places of employment.\n\nAnthropologists are experiencing a shift in the twenty-first century United States with the rise of forensic anthropology. In the United States, as opposed to many other countries forensic anthropology falls under the domain of the anthropologist and not the Forensic pathologist. In this role, forensic anthropologists help in the identification of skeletal remains by deducing biological characteristics such as sex, age, stature, and ancestry from the skeleton. However, forensic anthropologists tend to gravitate more toward working in academic and laboratory settings, while forensic pathologists perform more applied field work. Forensic anthropologists typically hold academic doctorates, while forensic pathologists are medical doctors. The field of forensic anthropology is rapidly evolving with increasingly capable technology and more extensive databases. Forensic anthrology is one of the most specialized and competitive job areas within the field of anthropology and currently has more qualified graduates than positions.\n\nThe profession of Anthropology has also received an additional sub-field with the rise of Digital anthropology. This new branch of the profession has an increased usage of computers as well as interdisciplinary work with medicine, computer visualization, industrial design, biology, and journalism. Anthropologists in this field primarily study the evolution of human reciprocal relations with the computer-generated world. Cyber anthropologists also study digital and cyber ethics along with the global implications of increasing connectivity. With cyber ethical issues such as net neutrality increasingly coming to light, this sub-field is rapidly gaining more recognition. One rapidly emerging branch of interest for cyber anthropologists is artificial intelligence. Cyber anthropologists study the co-evolutionary relationship between humans and artificial intelligence. This includes the examination of computer-generated (CG) environments and how people interact with them through media such as movies, television, and video.\n\nSome notable anthropologists include: Edward Burnett Tylor, James George Frazer, Franz Boas, Bronisław Malinowski, Elsie Clews Parsons, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Margaret Mead, Zora Neale Hurston, Ruth Benedict, Ella Deloria, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Clifford Geertz, and Paul Rabinow.\n\n"}

It is the 13th installment of FromSoftware's \"Armored Core\" series. \"Armored Core: For Answer\" is the direct sequel to \"Armored Core 4\", and takes place around ten years later. It was released in Japan on March 19, 2008, in North America on September 16, 2008, and in Europe on October 3, 2008.\n\nAC customization has been changed from the previous \"Armored Core\" title, with a new interface and many new parts not found in \"Armored Core 4\". Online mode returns with a new co-operative mode alongside the player versus mode. Gameplay enhancements included a power increase for both Quick Boost and Over Boost, as well as an auxiliary high speed booster known as Vanguard Over Booster (VOB). Another new feature in the game is the Assault Armor attack that becomes available by equipping certain OB parts. This attack uses up all available Primal Armor that the AC has and generates a huge blast consisting of Kojima (highly reactive particles) that destroys or damages all objects surrounding the AC. However, this also leaves the AC vulnerable because not only will the AC lose its PA, it will also not regenerate for a few seconds. Laser blades are deadlier because of the revamped laser blade attack. Once the blade has acquired a lock-on, the AC will instantly rush to the target, traveling a great distance to use the laser blade. All parts carried over from the previous game have had their parameters altered, much like the transition between previous series installments Silent Line and Nexus. The on-screen HUD can now be changed to any of 20 colors. There are now 442 FRS tuning points available to unlock, which is an increase from the 300 (PS3) and 337 (Xbox 360) FRS points available in AC4. Maps are much larger and more detailed including environment damage such as collapsing buildings. The game is also the second in the series (after ) to feature multiple endings, with three different possible plot branches available depending on your actions and decisions in the game.\n\n\"Armored Core: For Answer\" received generally mixed reviews. The scores tended to be about the same or a little lower than those for \"Armored Core 4\". (with exceptions, such as IGN, who scored the game considerably higher than AC4) One of the most consistent complaints among reviewers seemed to be the lack of any sort of online community. Kevin Van Ord of GameSpot stated in his review that there were \"fewer than a dozen [players on] Xbox Live\" when he tried to playtest the game, and that similar attempts to find a game on PlayStation Network yielded \"just a single opponent\".\n"}

{"id": "88358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=88358", "title": "Book of Shadows", "text": "Book of Shadows\n\nA Book of Shadows is a book containing religious texts and instructions for magical rituals found within the Neopagan religion of Wicca, and in many pagan practices. One famous Book of Shadows was created by the pioneering Wiccan Gerald Gardner sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, and which he utilised first in his Bricket Wood coven and then in other covens which he founded in following decades. The Book of Shadows is also used by other Wiccan traditions, such as Alexandrianism and Mohsianism, and with the rise of books teaching people how to begin following Wicca in the 1970s onward, the idea of the Book of Shadows was then further propagated amongst solitary practitioners unconnected to earlier traditions.\n\nInitially, when Wicca was still dominated by covens, \"only one copy [of the Book] existed for an entire coven, kept by the high priestess or high priest. That rule has proved unfeasible, and it is [now] commonplace for all Witches to have their own copies.\" In the various traditions that make up British Traditional Wicca, copies of the original Book composed by Gerald Gardner with the aid of his High Priestess Doreen Valiente, along with alterations and additions that have been made since then, is followed by adherents. They have tried to keep the contents of this Book a secret, although it has been published on a number of occasions by figures such as Charles Cardell, Lady Sheba, and Janet and Stewart Farrar. In other Wiccan traditions and amongst a number of solitary practitioners, alternate versions of the Book have been written that are independent of Gardner's original.\n\nNumerous associations and traditions have since grown up around the Book of Shadows. Traditionally, \"a Witch's book of shadows is destroyed upon death.\" The concept of the Book of Shadows has subsequently appeared in popular culture, for instance being utilised in the American television series \"Charmed\" and providing the title of films, musical albums and comics. However, in all these cases it was taken out of its original Wiccan context.\n\nGerald Gardner, the \"father of Wicca\", first introduced the Book of Shadows to people that he had initiated into the craft through his Bricket Wood coven in the 1950s. He claimed that it was a personal cookbook of spells that have worked for the owner; they could copy from his own book and add or remove material as they saw fit. He said that the practice of Witches keeping such a book was ancient, and was practised by the Witch-cult throughout history. According to tradition, Gardner claimed, the book was burned after a person died, so that it would not be discovered that they had been a witch.\n\nGerald Gardner did not mention any such thing as a \"Book of Shadows\" in his 1949 (though written three years earlier), novel about mediaeval witchcraft, \"High Magic's Aid\". Doreen Valiente claimed that this was because at the time, Gardner had not yet conceived of the idea, and only invented it after writing his novel.\n\nHigh Priestess Doreen Valiente made the claim that Gardner found the term \"Book of Shadows\" from a 1949 edition (Volume I, Number 3) of a magazine known as \"The Occult Observer\". In this edition, she claimed, was an advertisement for Gardner's novel, \"High Magic's Aid\", which was opposite an article titled \"The Book of Shadows\" written by the palmist Mir Bashir. The article in question was about an allegedly ancient Sanskrit divination manual which explained how to foretell things based upon the length of a person's shadow. Valiente theorised that Gardner then adopted this term for his Witches' grimoire. She maintained that \"It was a good name, and it is a good name still, wherever Gardner found it\".\nA leather bound manuscript written in Gardner's handwriting that was titled \"Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical\" was later found amongst his papers from the Museum after his death by Aidan Kelly and was later obtained by Richard and Tamarra James of the Wiccan Church of Canada. It appeared to be a first draft of Gardner's Book of Shadows, and featured sections based upon the rituals of the Ordo Templi Orientis which had been devised by the occultist Aleister Crowley. Gardner had gained access to these rituals in 1946, when he had purchased a charter from Crowley giving him permission to perform the OTO rituals.\n\nSome people have taken this as evidence that Gardner invented the idea of a Witches' Grimoire, perhaps sometime between 1946 (when he finished his novel \"High Magic's Aid\"), and 1949, and had named it \"Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical\". In 1949, he had renamed it to the \"Book of Shadows\", and soon began to make use of it with his Bricket Wood Coven.\n\nAdding weight to the evidence indicating Gardner invented the Book was that other Neo-pagan witches of the time, such as Robert Cochrane, never made use of such a book.\n\nIn 1953, Doreen Valiente joined Gardner's Bricket Wood coven, and soon rose to become its High Priestess. She noticed how much of the material in his Book of Shadows was taken not from ancient sources as Gardner had initially claimed, but from the works of the occultist Aleister Crowley, from \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\", from the \"Key of Solomon\" and also from the rituals of Freemasonry. She confronted Gardner with this, who admitted that the text he had received from the New Forest coven had been fragmentary and he had had to fill much of it using various sources. He also stated that \"well, if you think you can do any better, go ahead\", and Valiente thought that she could, later stating that:\n\nValiente rewrote much of it, cutting out a lot of sections that had come from Crowley (whose negative reputation she feared), though retaining parts that originated with \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\", which she felt was genuine witchcraft practice. Valiente dramatically rewrote sections such as the \"Charge of the Goddess\" and also wrote several poems for the book, such as \"The Witches Rune\". She also helped to create a poem to include the Wiccan Rede within it.\n\nValiente also noticed that a chant in one ritual in the book was based upon the poem \"A Tree Song\" from \"Puck of Pook's Hill\" by Rudyard Kipling, which she had enjoyed as a child. The chant in question stated that:\n\nThis version of the ritual, written by both Gardner and Valiente, but containing sections adopted from various sources, such as Aleister Crowley, \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\", and even Rudyard Kipling, went on to become the traditional text for Gardnerian Wicca.\n\nIn forms of British Traditional Wicca, which include Gardnerian Wicca, Alexandrian Wicca and Algard Wicca, the Book of Shadows used by adherents is based upon that written by Gardner and Valiente.\n\nAlthough his own book had been put together with the help of Doreen Valiente and included material from a variety of modern sources, (notably from \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\" and the writings of Aleister Crowley) it also included sections written in an antique (or mock-antique) style, including advice for witches brought to trial and tortured. Gardner claimed that these sections were genuinely historical in origin, and that witches had not been allowed to write anything down until recently, to avoid incrimination; when at last Books of Shadows were allowed, the rituals and spells had to be written in a jumbled manner to prevent any non-initiate from using them. More recent scholars however have doubted their authenticity.\n\nIt seems likely that Gardner told his three subsequent initiatory lines that the book should be copied word for word, and Wiccans descended from Eleanor Bone, Patricia Crowther and Monique Wilson have widely believed that the book was of ancient provenance. North American Gardnerians of the Long Island line allow covens to add rituals and teachings to the book, but nothing may be removed.\n\nThere sometimes exists two Books of Shadows kept by more traditional Wiccans, one being a coven book of core rituals and practises which remains unchanged and from which new initiates copy, and the second, intended for personal use, which differs from witch to witch and contains magical material collected by the initiate, such as astrology, herbal lore, and information regarding divination.\n\nAfter Gardner's death, his rival, Charles Cardell, published much of the material from the Gardnerian Book of Shadows. In the 1970s, the then Alexandrians Janet Farrar and Stewart Farrar decided, with the consent of Doreen Valiente, that much of the Gardnerian book should be published in its true form. Much of it was published by the Farrars in their 1984 book \"The Witches' Way\".\n\nIn non-traditional or \"eclectic\" forms of Wiccan or Neo-pagan practice, the term \"Book of Shadows\" is more often used to describe a personal journal, rather than a traditional text. This journal records rituals, spells, and their results, as well as other magical information. This can be either an individual or coven text, and is not normally passed from teacher to student. In many cases, this kind of Book of Shadows is an electronic document (disk or website) instead of a hand-written one. Some reserve the Book of Shadows for recording spells and keep a separate book, sometimes called the Book of Mirrors to contain thoughts, feelings and experiences.\nNot all traditions of Wicca utilize the term \"Book of Shadows\". In Seax Wica, a tradition founded by Raymond Buckland, the Book of Shadows is called \"The Tree\", and in Devotional Wicca, the book is titled \"The Book of Ways\"; many traditions refer to their Books of Shadows as simply \"The Book\".\nThe television fantasy series \"Charmed\" features a fictional \"Book of Shadows\" which contains spells and arcane law, and has a supernatural ability to defend itself from harm. In the 1996 film \"The Craft\", which some critics saw as a major influence on the series \"Charmed\", the \"Book of Shadows\" was referred to as an object in which a witch keeps her \"power thoughts\".\n\nThe 2000 sequel to \"The Blair Witch Project\" was titled \"\" and featured a Wiccan character, despite there being no mention of a \"Book of Shadows\", during the film. But in the film's teaser trailer, reveals the \"Book of Shadows\" itself but never appeared in the film. In the trailer, the \"Book of Shadows\" was found by a half-naked woman, Erica Geerson (portrayed by Erica Leerhsen) in the woods of Black Hills, until she was attacked by an unknown man. The title was seen as an attempt to capitalise on the \"Charmed\" series' established market.\n\nIn the 2011 television series, \"The Secret Circle\" each family is shown to have their own \"Book of Shadows\", with each book containing unique spells. As the book is passed down from generation to generation, each generation appears to write their own spells or notes, as indicated by Cassie's recognition of her mother's handwriting in her own family's \"Book of Shadows\".\n\nThe Japanese horror adventure game \"Corpse Party: Book of Shadows\" deals with the eponymous book during its final chapter, in which it is revealed to be an actual Book of Shadows very much in keeping with the description in this article (albeit in the game, there is only one Book of Shadows that exists, containing a complete chronicle of all spells that exist in the entire world, be they Wiccan or not).\n\nIn the Australian television series \"Nowhere Boys\" two characters are known to possess a Book of Shadows. One being one of the protagonists, Felix Ferne, and one being an antagonist, Alice Hartley. Felix's book was first thought to be his diary as he tried to hide its true existence from his friends, and Alice's book was thought to be her sister's.\n\nIn the fifth edition of roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons, members of the warlock class can gain a Book of Shadows, which enables them to learn extra spells and rituals regardless of whether or not such magic is ordinarily accessible through the warlock class.\n\n"}

It aired on March 7, 2000 and guest stars Sam Waterston as Dr. Kaplan. The episode sees Brian Griffin visit a psychiatrist to aid his urinary incontinence, and then discovers his love for Lois.\n\nLois is upset that Stewie has wet the carpet in the living room. Stewie emphatically denies doing so, but Lois and Peter are convinced that it is a sign that Stewie is ready to potty train. After a failed attempt by Peter at getting Stewie to use the toilet, the family goes to the supermarket to buy groceries. In the checkout line, Brian urinates once again, revealing that Stewie is innocent.\n\nThis leads to Brian seeing Dr. Kaplan, a psychiatrist. The doctor decides Brian is having a midlife crisis, so Brian goes traveling. Brian feels better, but shortly after returning, Stewie gets revenge by framing Brian for peeing all over the living room. While unable to remember having done so, Brian believes he has done it himself and returns to Dr. Kaplan to find out why. After revealing that his last accident happened after watching Lois and Peter have a water fight while washing the car, Dr. Kaplan tells Brian that he thinks Brian might be in love with Lois. Stewie catches on when Brian attempts to flirt with Lois and smells one of her shirts and nearly exposes him by cuddling up with Lois.\n\nLater, Brian implies to Lois his feelings and she sweetly rejects him. He then wonders what would happen if they were both drunk, to which Lois starts to respond, \"Well I'd have to be really...\" before giving a flat-out \"No!\". An oblivious Peter conjectures that Brian's beloved would \"probably end up with some idiot\".\n\nIn his 2008 review, Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode an 8/10, saying that the episode shows Brian's love for Lois in \"a perfectly believable and somewhat heartfelt earnest manner\". He stated that \"while not every joke works [...] the focus on Brian's feelings is pretty significant for the series from both an entertainment and ongoing storyline perspective.\" \n\n\n"}

The sweet tart consists of a filling of butter, sugar, syrup, and egg, baked in a pastry shell until the filling is semi-solid with a crunchy top. The butter tart should not be confused with butter pie (a savoury pie from the Preston area of Lancashire, England) or with bread and butter pudding.\n\nRecipes for the butter tart vary according to the families baking them. Because of this, the appearance and physical characteristics of the butter tart – the firmness of its pastry, or the consistency of its filling – also vary.\n\nTraditionally, the English Canadian tart consists of butter, sugar, and eggs in a pastry shell, similar to the French-Canadian sugar pie, or the base of the U.S. pecan pie without the nut topping. The butter tart is different from pecan pie in that it has a \"runnier\" filling due to the omission of corn starch. Often raisins, walnuts or pecans are added to the traditional butter tart. However purists contend that such additions should not be allowed.\n\nMore exotic flavours are also produced by some bakers. Examples such as maple– bacon, pumpkin, chili and salted caramel cardamom flavours have been made for competitions.\n\nButter tarts were common in pioneer Canadian cooking, and they remain a characteristic pastry of Canada, considered a recipe of genuinely Canadian origin. It is primarily eaten in and associated with the English-speaking provinces of Canada.\n\nSome suggested pastries with similar origins to the butter tart include:\n\nThe earliest published Canadian recipe is from Barrie, Ontario, dating back to 1900 and can be found in The Women's Auxiliary of the Royal Victoria Hospital Cookbook, to which a Mrs. Mary Ethel MacLeod submitted the recipe for a butter tart filling. The original cookbook and recipe is housed at the Simcoe County Archives. Another early publication of a butter tart recipe was found in a 1915 pie cookbook. The food was an integral part of early Canadian cuisine and often viewed as a source of pride.\n\nSimilar tarts are made in Scotland, where they are often referred to as \"Ecclefechan butter tarts\" from the town of Ecclefechan. In France, they are related to the much more common \"\", that differs from the basic Canadian recipe only by the addition of ground almonds.\n\nButter tarts are an integral part of Eastern Canadian cuisine and are objects of cultural pride of many communities across Ontario and indeed Canada. This cultural and community connection with the tart has spawned butter tart themed tourism such as the Butter Tart festival at Muskoka Lakes, Ontario, the trademarked \"Butter Tart Trail\" at Wellington North, Ontario, and the \"Butter Tart Tour\" in Kawarthas Northumberland, Ontario. The two competing associations have since resolved their dispute through the mutual agreement to modify \"The Butter Tart Tour\" to \"Kawarthas Northumberland Butter Tart Tour\". The first Kawarthas Northumberland Butter Tart Tour Taste-Off was launched at the Flavour Festival in Peterborough on Sunday, April 28, 2013, where four bakeries were crowned winners by a panel of celebrity judges.\n\nOntario's Best Butter Tart Festival and Contest is an annual event held in Midland, Ontario. The contest portion of the festival attracts bakers from across Ontario, and is Canada's largest butter tart themed celebration, with over 50,000 tarts sold in the festival market in 2014.\n\nEven \"National Geographic\" recognizes the significance of the butter tart in an article on Georgian Bay, Ontario. In October 2013, referring to a stand in Wasaga Beach, they stated that \"It's the homemade Canadian butter tarts – flaky crust with gooey pecan filling – that set this place apart from other lakeside ice cream stands.\" \n\n\n"}
{"id": "44381789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44381789", "title": "Car coat", "text": "Car coat\n\nA car coat is an outer garment originally made to be worn by automobile drivers and passengers. First designed to provide maximum warmth and coverage, over time it became a much shorter garment. Today it describes a coat that typically ends at mid thigh. It is worn by both men and women.\n\nWhile fur, leather and heavy wool were preferred in the early days, today the coat may be made in a wide variety of materials. In the period after World War II, it took on design elements of the jeep coat worn by servicemen and this is when the shorter length became common. As car ownership grew so did the popularity of the coat; by the 1960s it was described as \"ubiquitous\". The car coat remains popular today, both as a functional and a fashion garment.\nOriginally the car coat was more usually termed 'motoring dress'. It emerged in the early 1900s, when driving was considered an outdoor sport (most cars were open top) and required protective clothing. Clothing for men and women and for driver and passenger was relatively similar, comprising a long heavy coat. This was often in fur or lined with fur, although sometimes it was in heavy cloth. In summer, women would wear a duster coat, sometimes called a dust coat, to cover their garments, in a cloth such as linen or alpaca wool. This would be accessorised with gloves, goggles and a hat – women often wore elaborate hats and veils, while men would wear a cap. These accessories were worn year round. \nMotoring was still an activity for the elite, however the privations of driving in a vehicle that broke down frequently and provided no retreat from the elements, meant clothing had to be functional and warm. Sports motorist Dorothy Levitt – author of the 1909 handbook \"The Woman and the Car\" and dubbed 'the fastest woman on earth' for her 'scorching' (speeding) antics round tracks such as Brooklands – provided useful tips for women drivers on what to wear, along with guidance about the mechanical aspects of driving. On choosing the right coat, she said: \"Under no circumstance wear lace or fluffy adjuncts to your toilet. There is nothing like a thick frieze, homespun or tweed coat lined with fur. Do not heed the cry, 'nothing like leather.' Leather coats do not wear gracefully.\"\n\nIn the 1920s, women continued to favour male motoring dress and this also crossed over into high fashion. A 1921 article in \"The Times\" about the latest Paris fashions described a red leather motoring coat fastened with metal buckles. Similar leather coats had been popular for chauffeurs and male motorists for several years. Fur was still popular, with a fashion correspondent noting that the Motor Show in Olympia was transforming shop windows around London. She recommended the latest craze for fur-lined coats in tweed, wool velour and cheviot. Musquash and nutria were also being chosen by women motorists, while in Knightsbridge, one new store was offering women's coats suitable for motoring made from men's suiting cloth. \n\nAccessories also followed the unisex trend; \"The Times\" described the arrival of neat leather caps as a fashion accessory for women in 1923. This style of sporty hat was worn in the iconic Tamara de Lempicka self-portrait of 1929 in which she is driving a green Bugatti with leather cap and driving gloves – reputed to be based on an Hermès set that she had seen on the cover of the magazine \"Vu\". As this portrait suggests, and Peter Thorold has noted, the car had become the ultimate symbol of modernity and emancipation, something that was reflected in the styling of clothes. Although no coat is visible in the de Lempicka portrait, by the late 1920s the latest motoring coats from France were worn long, made of tweed or flannel with narrow leather belts and collars in fur or flannel. Wide raglan sleeves were popular – allowing freedom of movement – and collars could be military in style with buttons up to the neck.\n\nReporting on fashions in the shops ahead of the 1931 Motor Show, \"The Times\" described not only furs, but a new trend for shorter coats – made of suede and silk lined with zips as fastening – for walking and motoring. As cars became more common and designs provided more protection from the elements, clothing reduced in weight and quantity. However the leather motoring coat remained popular as a distinct item of dress throughout the 1930s. \nThe immediate precursor to the postwar (modern) car coat was based around the jeep coat, a design popular in wartime for the drivers of open-topped vehicles. This was generally of a shorter length, ending at mid thigh.\n\nBy the early 1960s, some car coats were being designed in nylon, a report from the British Nylon Spinners' Fair in London in 1961 described a new washable mock suede car coat with brushed fleece nylon lining as: \"one of the good possibilities\" of the technology. Real leathers remained popular – showerproof suede models with detachable collars and large leather buttons were being designed for women by 1964. These were also in the shorter length, ending at mid thigh. Another new motoring design was the roebuck suede (deerskin) jacket, designed at hip length for both women and men, and described as a real innovation because: \"A suede upon which grease, alcohol, even motor oil has no effect is a find indeed.\"\n\nWarmth was still considered a key component of the car coat, with water-repellent poplin models with padded and quilted linings being designed for women as \"knock-about car coats\". These came complete with detachable hoods and toggle fastenings. Fur was still being promoted for motorists, but as a prestige item to go with prestige cars. An advert from 1965 in \"The Times\" by the National Fur Company entitled \"An ocelot in your Jaguar\" said: \"We consider that an important feature of a car coat is its length – about halfway between a jacket and a 3/4 coat. At this length, it's comfortable to wear when driving. It doesn't ride up. Or 'seat'. And there is no risk of undue wear on the seat or back.\"\n\nBy the late 1960s, the car coat was an item of leisurewear, rather than simply a motoring accessory, and was being produced in a variety of fabrics, including sheepskin and the new manmade fur varieties. A fashion writer describing the uses of faux fur said: \"Apart from coats they are made into all kinds of leisure wear, of which the now ubiquitous car coat is a conspicuous example. Derived from the more expensive but still popular sheepskin jacket, it is usually made from a cotton suedette or brushed nylon outer fabric lined with an acrylic pile\".\nWhile women continued to wear the car-coat length – among others – by the mid 1960s the car coat had become a staple item of the male wardrobe. Editor of \"The Tailor and Cutter\" magazine John Taylor, writing in 1966, said: \"The riding mac was the equivalent in the nineteen twenties and thirties of the car coat of the nineteen fifties and sixties. If a riding mac was worn there was the suggestion that it had been bought for a specific purpose. The wearer probably owned a hack and therefore was not a member of the \"hoi polloi\". For similar reasons today, however submerged in the psyches of their owners the reasons may lie, there are far more car coats in male wardrobes than there are cars in garages.\"\n\nAlthough the car coat was by now a familiar item, it did not mean it couldn't be reinvented. Michael Carr, who had designed an ergonomic racing suit for his company's co-director Stirling Moss applied first design principles to add functionality. Made of waterproofed poplin, his design of 1968 featured a zip front and separate velcro quick fasten strip. Buttons were designed so they didn't catch on the car seat belt, gathered cuffs excluded draughts and pockets were designed to fall on the knee while seated in the car. There was also an interior deep pocket for roadmaps. During the 1970s, the car coat continued to be a wardrobe staple for men, while car coat became a description of cut and length in women's fashion (often looser and always shorter than a traditional coat).\n\nFrom the 1980s on, the men's car coat started to symbolise a particular character or walk of life on British TV and in the press, especially when worn in sheepskin or camel hair. Sheepskin was the style favoured by Del Boy in \"Only Fools & Horses\" and by football managers. It was also worn by detectives in \"The Sweeney\". Later, the \"Life on Mars\" detective series, in which the hero is transported back to the 1970s, would reprise the car coat by giving DCI Gene Hunt a scruffy version in camel wool. More celebrated still are the trademarked sheepskin car coats worn by BBC football commentator John Motson – he wore his first in 1972, acquired from a furrier he met at a party in Chelsea, and subsequently had them made on Savile Row. It had become such a shorthand description for British football pundits by the late 1990s that a \"Times\" feature about the warm-up for the 1998 World Cup began with the description: \"Paul Sexton, our man in the sheepskin car coat, on the tournament for the World Cup\". \nIn the late 1990s the car coat attracted attention as a fashion curiosity when Liam Gallagher wore a sheepskin model to the Brit Awards; Craig David wore a similar design in 2001. The car coat length has remained popular since 2008 – with \"GQ\" citing the \"\"Mad Men\" effect\" as a contributor to the revival of more formal and retro styles.\n\nIn 2010-11, it was popular on the catwalks for both men's and women's coats. Some versions were in fur and shearling (sheepskin), as well as in camel colourways. In 2013, it was described as the best coat length of the season.\n\n"}

Originally released for MS-DOS in 1990, the game was later ported to the Amiga and the Sega Genesis in 1991. \"Centurion\" shares much of the concept and feel with Beck's earlier game \"Defender of the Crown\" (1987).\n\nThe game begins in Ancient Rome in the year 275 BC, placing the player in the sandals of a centurion in the Roman army, at first leading a single legion. The player's ultimate goal is to become a Caesar through a mix of successful military conquests and internal politics of \"Bread and Circuses\".\n\nThe bulk of the game involve turn-based strategic planning and management on the world map and the real-time battles (with on-demand pauses to give orders to formations) against various enemies of the Roman Empire, such as the Celts, Carthaginians and Parthians. \"Centurion\" also featured other \"side-show\" activities, such as gladiatorial combat (the player's duties involve financing the ludi events), chariot racing in the Circus Maximus, and naval battles. There is also some diplomacy (it is even possible to seduce the queen Cleopatra after forming an alliance with Egypt).\n\nThe game's designer, Kellyn Beck, was also the creator of several Cinemaware games and \"Centurion\" was similar in look to those games, featuring \"cinematic\" graphics, animation and sound effects. His inspiration for the game came from watching the films \"Ben Hur\" and \"Spartacus\" and the game's working title was \"Caesar\". The team Bits of Magic, who co-designed and programmed the game, included Nicky Robinson.\n\nThe PC version of \"Centurion\" received 3 out of 5 stars in \"Dragon\". Other magazines, however, usually gave the game better reviews, with scores mostly in the range of 75-90%. \"Computer Gaming World\" gave it three-plus stars out of five in 1990. The magazine praised the VGA graphics and audio, and said that as a game as opposed to an accurate historical simulation, \"Centurion\" \"succeeds admirably ... those who liked those old gladiator movies\" would enjoy it. In 1993 the magazine gave the game two-plus stars, describing it as a \"graphical \"tour de force\"—a historic \"tour de farce\"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "18322505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18322505", "title": "Commentary (philology)", "text": "Commentary (philology)\n\nIn philology, a commentary is a line-by-line or even word-by-word explication usually attached to an edition of a text in the same or an accompanying volume. It may draw on methodologies of close reading and literary criticism, but its primary purpose is to elucidate the language of the text and the specific culture that produced it, both of which may be foreign to the reader. Such a commentary usually takes the form of footnotes, endnotes, or separate text cross-referenced by line, paragraph or page.\n\nMeans of providing commentary on the language of the text include notes on textual criticism, syntax and semantics, and the analysis of rhetoric, literary tropes, and style. The aim is to remove, lessen or point out linguistic obstacles to reading and understanding the text.\n\nIf a text is historical, or is produced within a culture assumed to be of limited familiarity to a reader, a broader range of issues may require elucidation. These include, but are by no means limited to, biographical data pertaining to the author, historical events, customs and laws, technical terminology and facts of daily life, religious beliefs and philosophical perspectives, literary allusions, geographical settings, and cross-references to related passages in the same work, other works by the author, or sources used by the author.\n\nSome commentaries from Classical Antiquity or the Middle Ages (more strictly referred to as scholia) are a valuable source of information otherwise unknown, including references to works that are now lost. Jerome provides a list of several commentaries that were in use during his days as a student in the 350s A.D. One of the most used of the ancient scholia today is that of Servius on Vergil’s \"Aeneid\", written in the 4th century.\n\nThe production of commentaries began to flourish in the 16th century as part of the humanist project to recover the texts of antiquity, with its related boom in publishing. In the modern era, a commentary differs from an annotated edition aimed at students or the casual reader in that it attempts to address an exhaustive range of scholarly questions, many of which may be of concern or interest primarily to specialists. The commentator may take a position on variant readings of the text or on a point of scholarly dispute, but arguments are usually succinct, a paragraph or less than a page in length.\n\nThe earliest examples, and also one of the largest corpora of text commentaries from the ancient world, comes from first-millennium-BCE Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Known from over 860 manuscripts, the majority of which date to the period 700-100 BCE, most of these commentaries explore numerous types of texts, including literary works (such as the Babylonian Epic of Creation), medical treatises, magical texts, ancient dictionaries, and law collections (the Code of Hammurabi). Most of them, however, comment on divination treatises, in particular treatises that predict the future from the appearance and movement of celestial bodies on the one hand (Enūma Anu Enlil), and from the appearance of a sacrificed sheep’s liver on the other (Bārûtu).\n\nAs with the majority of the thousands of texts from the ancient Near East that have survived to the present day, Mesopotamian text commentaries are written on clay tablets in cuneiform script. Text commentaries are written in the East Semitic language of Akkadian, but due to the influence of lexical lists written in Sumerian language on cuneiform scholarship, they often contain Sumerian words or phrases as well.\n\nCuneiform commentaries are important because they provide information about Mesopotamian languages and culture that are not available elsewhere in the cuneiform record. To give but one example, the pronunciation of the cryptically written name of Gilgamesh, the hero of the Epic of Gilgamesh, was discovered in a cuneiform commentary on a medical text. However, the significance of cuneiform commentaries extends beyond the light they shed on specific details of Mesopotamian civilization. They open a window onto what the concerns of the Mesopotamian literate elite were when they read some of the most widely studied texts in the Mesopotamian intellectual tradition, a perspective that is important for “seeing things their way.” Finally, cuneiform commentaries are also the earliest examples of textual interpretation. It has been repeatedly argued that they influenced rabbinical exegesis. See Akkadian Commentaries and Early Hebrew Exegesis\n\nThe publication and interpretation of these texts began in the mid-nineteenth century, with the discovery of the royal Assyrian libraries at Nineveh, from which ca. 454 text commentaries have been recovered. The study of cuneiform commentaries is, however, far from complete. It is the subject of on-going research by the small, international community of scholars who specialize in the field of Assyriology. \n\n\n\n"}

It is called Mesa Encantada in Spanish and Katzimo or Kadzima in Keresan. Acoma tradition says that Enchanted Mesa was the home of the Acoma people until a severe storm and landslide destroyed the only approach. There are no longer any ruins on the flat top. The butte is high, long and only ft wide, at its widest. The elevation at the top is .\n\nIn 1892, when Charles F. Lummis was visiting Acoma he listened to the old Indian governor, Martín Valle, who told the story of how the Acoma people used to live on Enchanted Mesa. Their access to the top was on the southern side where a large piece of the butte was said to have spalled off and formed a ramp, a \"stone ladder\", up to the top. In reality, access was by climbing a ladder in a narrow fissure. Evidence of holes carved into the sandstone on either side of the fissure can be seen, located in the horseshoe shaped bowl at the southern end. . The early inhabitants had a precipitous climb up the fissure, but it assured their safety. Into these holes were placed stout lengths of wood, the 'rungs' of the ladder. Today, this is still the only means of climbing access to the top of the mesa. Their fields, and the springs that were their water source, were in the valley. In the summer, the entire village would descend into the valley to tend the crops. One afternoon a severe thunderstorm washed away the \"stone ladder\", leaving only sheer rock faces all the way around the butte. Legend has it that three old women and a young boy had been left in the village, but they could not get down, nor could anyone else get back to the village. A giant thunderbird swooped down and scooped up the four and carried them to the valley floor. The Acoma people abandoned Enchanted Mesa and moved to White Rock Mesa, now called Acoma.\n\nIn 1897, Professor William Libbey from Princeton University climbed Enchanted Mesa to disprove the existence of ruins. His team used a cannon to shoot a rope over the end of the butte and using a pulley pulled himself up in a marine life-saving chair. Libbey and a newspaperman climbed to the top, spent two to three hours exploring, and returned empty-handed. Libbey announced that he had seen no ruins or artifacts, saying \"Romantic Indian legend can never stand the acid test of scientific investigation.\" Self-educated archaeologist Frederick Webb Hodge did not take Libbey's word for it. On a later 1897 expedition he reported evidence of occupation. Although the main ruins had been washed over the edge by centuries of thunderstorms, he found plenty of arrow points, stone tools, beads and pottery fragments lodged in crevices.\n\nOn 18 November 1974, an Acoma police officer indicated that he had seen a UFO over Enchanted Mesa. Over the next several days, other officers reported \"a red light, faster than any aircraft\". A helicopter was dispatched to the top with the governor of the pueblo and a police officer, but no direct evidence of a UFO was found.\n\nThe massive cliffs are formed by the Zuni Sandstone and the butte is topped by the Dakota Sandstone.\n"}

The game has a companion called \"\" for the Nintendo 3DS.\n\nAll has been well in Wasteland since Mickey helped defeat the Shadow Blot, with all the forgotten characters rebuilding their home. However, a series of earthquakes threatens to undo the work and the world. The Mad Doctor (who somehow survived his defeat and mostly sings instead of talking) arrives and asks Oswald to join forces with him to help repair Wasteland. Gus, the leader of the Gremlins, and Ortensia, Oswald's wife (who doesn't trust the Mad Doctor), contact Mickey Mouse. Mickey once more enters Yen Sid's workshop and takes the magic brush to aid him as he enters Wasteland. Oswald joins up with them in Dark Beauty Castle, explaining the Mad Doctor warned him of the Blotworx - Blotlings piloting mechanical suits - which have taken control of the Beetleworx production. The castle begins collapsing, forcing them to escape; Oswald retrieves his powerful remote en route.\n\nMickey and Oswald fight their way through Wasteland, defeating Blotlings, Beetleworx, and Blotworx (including a giant robotic dragon in which it can be redeemed or defeated) and helping other characters. After repairing the disabled projectors, they notice one of the Gremlins named Prescott is acting strange and they follow him. This takes them to Fort Wasteland, an area that was seemly destroyed before the events of Mickey's last visit, which leads to the Floatyard, where they find he has built a massive robot designed after him. Destroying or trapping the mech, Mickey and Oswald try interrogating Prescott, only to have Animatronic Daisy Duck's news team and the Mad Doctor arrive; the doc seems to put Prescott in a hypnotic trance, making him confess to being behind the chaos which convinces everyone except for the duo. Concerned, Mickey and Oswald follow the Mad Doctor's trail to his hideout, which leads them through Autotopia, another area that was also supposedly destroyed during the Blot's revolt. After finding his diary, they learn that he wants to take all the paint to broadcast a show into the Cartoon world, so people can remember him and give him a heart to escape Wasteland and it is also revealed that he was the one who made the Blotworx who eventually turned on him and he was also the cause of the earthquakes via paint extraction devices found in Autotopia. They defeat the Mad Doctor, whose robotic body finally gives out and is either defeated or redeemed depending on which path was taken in his fight. Afterwards, the Wasteland celebrates Mickey and Oswald's triumph with a parade highlighting the duo's major choices in the game (including the three bosses).\n\nHowever, the Petes of Wasteland, with Petetronic being present if Mickey and Oswald achieve the bad ending, kidnap Prescott, presumably having plans for both him and Wasteland.\n\nLike its predecessor, \"Epic Mickey 2\" takes place in a world based on classic and retired Disney characters and attractions. Likewise, the gameplay in \"Epic Mickey 2\" closely resembles that of the original. One of the biggest updates is the addition of Oswald as a supporting character for Mickey; Oswald can either be controlled by the computer or a second player. Oswald uses a remote control in method as Mickey uses his paintbrush, to attack or befriend enemy characters and to alter the environment as needed to complete tasks. Oswald also has many other abilities, such as flying with his ears, taking off his leg, using his arms as boomerangs, etc. There are also some special abilities that can only be used when Mickey and Oswald are working together. In the PlayStation 3 version of the game players are able to use motion controls using the PlayStation Move controller.\n\nOn August 27, 2011, Destructoid posted an article that speculated that a sequel, \"Epic Mickey 2\", was in development and showed possible box art for the game. These rumors were further encouraged when Disney France and Warren Spector invited the French media to an \"epic project\" taking place on March 27, 2012. Nintendo Power magazine also commented on the rumor, stating that their April 2012 issue would include a \"top-secret\" title preview, with the preview for the issue showing a cropped down picture of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.\n\nGame Trailers also stated that their March 22, 2012 episode would include a \"world-exclusive preview of Warren Spector's new epic adventure\" and that it would be \"notably significant\". Warren Spector himself also commented on the game's development, revealing that he had \"a team of over 700 people working on the sequel\". Following this, on March 20, 2012, the official French Nintendo magazine posted a comment on Twitter, revealing that Disney had plans to create a companion to the main sequel for the 3DS, under the name \"\".\n\nWarren Spector, on March 21, 2012, officially confirmed the rumors, revealing the sequel's title to be \"Epic Mickey: Power of Two\". Spector also directly addressed the camera issues that reviewers criticized in the first game, stating that \"They'll be working on it until the day we ship the second game. (There have been) over 1,000 specific changes made to the camera. Our goal is that you will not have to touch the manual camera controls even once to play through the main story path of this game.\"\n\nSpector also revealed that the game was to include voice acting and musical numbers, both of which were absent in the first game. Spector said: \"I'm such a geek about musicals, I love the co-op and next-gen stuff, but for me, when a character breaks into song, which they do on a regular basis in this game, it's magic.\"\n\nSpector also commented on the sequel's co-op features, stating that: \"It's drop-in, drop-out co-op, you can sit down at any time with a friend who is playing as Mickey, and you can take control of Oswald. If you're playing as a single player, Oswald will be there every second of the game. He's not just a multiplayer character, he's a helper, whether you're playing alone or with a friend or family member.\" Wasteland itself will feature old areas ruined by earthquakes and other natural disasters, as well as new areas such as Disney Gulch, based on Disneyland's Frontierland.\n\n12 screenshots for the game were released on October 4, 2012. Fans long speculated that the recently located Oswald cartoon \"Hungry Hobos\" (1928) would appear as an unlockable, but the final game included the Silly Symphony \"Skeleton Dance\" (1929) instead.\n\nOn March 18, 2013, the UK division of Disney Movie's announced via Twitter that Disney's \"Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two\" would be receiving a port to Sony's PlayStation Vita platform. The Vita version will be developed by Blitz Game Studios (in collaboration with Sony Computer Entertainment), which has already dealt with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 version of the game. Was announced that this version will be optimized especially for the Vita and that the defects of the original version will be placed, in particular the frame-rate and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, boasts of a co-op online or ad-hoc.\n\nIn October 2013, the previously cancelled PC port of Epic Mickey 2 was given a limited release in Central European countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic.\n\nJapanese magazine Famitsu confirmed that the game would arrive in Japan exclusively on Nintendo's consoles on September 26, 2013. The Nintendo 3DS sister title (renamed as \"Mickey’s Marvelous Adventure\") would arrive with \"The Power of Two\" on the same day in Japan. Unlike the previous title \"Epic Mickey\", \"Epic Mickey 2\" was published by Spike Chunsoft in Japan.\n\nOn October 6, 2014, \"Epic Mickey 2\" was made available on Steam.\n\n\"Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two\" received mixed reviews, with most complaints being the game not fixing issues that were present in the original. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Wii version 67.60% and 64/100, the Xbox 360 version 60.80% and 59/100 the PlayStation 3 version 57.83% and 59/100, the Wii U version 55.42% and 57/100, and the PlayStation Vita version 51.50% and 57/100.\n\nBy the end of 2012, \"Epic Mickey 2\" sold 529,000 copies in the United States. By the end of 2010, its predecessor had sold at least 1.3 million. In a recent interview, Warren Spector stated that he was 'in doubt' about the future of the series. Despite heavy advertising and due to gameplay criticism, the game barely sold a quarter of the copies the original did, making it a commercial bomb (its sales were scoped at around 2 million), despite being available on multiple platforms. Following these financial losses, Disney made an official statement on January 29, 2013 that Junction Point Studios was to be closed in order to direct resources to other projects. It is revealed that Disney still owns the \"Epic Mickey\" IP, but has no plan for the series. In 2016, concept art was leaked of a cancelled kart racer based on the Epic Mickey franchise, named Epic Mickey Racers, which was to include a number of other playable characters from Disney's legacy including Scrooge McDuck and Cruella De Vil as well as Mickey Mouse and Oswald the Rabbit.\n\nA sequel titled \"Epic Mickey 3\" was originally intended to be the third and final part of the \"Epic Mickey\" trilogy. Due to the poor sales of \"Epic Mickey 2\", Junction Point Studios closed on January 29, 2013, therefore canceling production on \"Epic Mickey 3\". It was also one of the very last games to be published by Disney Interactive Studios before it closed in May 2016.\n\n"}

They were usually in the Saturnine metre and took the form of a dialogue consisting of an interchange of extemporaneous raillery. Those who took part in them wore masks made of the bark of trees. At first harmless and good-humored, if somewhat coarse, these songs gradually outstripped the bounds of decency; malicious attacks were made upon both gods and men, and the matter became so serious that the law intervened and scurrilous personalities were forbidden by the Twelve Tables (Cicero, \"De re publica\", 4.10; see also Horace \"epist\". 2.1.139).\n\nSpecimens of the Fescennines used at weddings are the \"Epithalamium of Manlius\" (Catullus 61) and the four poems of Claudian in honor of the marriage of Honorius and Maria; the first, however, is distinguished by a licentiousness which is absent in the latter. Ausonius in his \"Cento nuptialis\" mentions the Fescennines of Annianus Faliscus, who lived in the time of Hadrian.\n\nVarious derivations have been proposed for the word \"Fescennine.\" According to Festus, they were introduced from Fescennia in Etruria, but there is no reason to assume that any particular town was specially devoted to the use of such songs. As an alternative Festus suggests a connection with \"fascinus\", the Latin word referring to a phallus-shaped amulet used to ward off the evil eye, either because the Fescennina were regarded as a protection against evil influences (see Munro, \"Criticisms and Elucidations of Catullus\", p. 76) or because the phallus, as the symbol of fertility, would from early times have been naturally associated with harvest festivals. H. Nettleship, in an article on \"The Earliest Italian Literature\" (\"Journal of Philology\", xi. 1882), in support of Munro's view, translates the expression \"verses used by charmers\", assuming a noun \"fescennus\", connected with \"fas fari\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23406517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23406517", "title": "Flying Star Feng Shui", "text": "Flying Star Feng Shui\n\nXuan Kong Flying Star feng shui or \"Xuan Kong Fei Xing\" is one of disciplines in Feng Shui, and is an integration of the principles of Yin Yang, the interactions between the five elements, the eight trigrams, the Lo Shu numbers, and the 24 Mountains, by using time, space and objects to create an astrological chart to analyze positive auras and negative auras of a building.\n\nThese include analyzing wealth, mental and physiological states, success, relationships with external parties, and health of the inhabitant.\n\nDuring the Qing Dynasty, it was popularized by a grandmaster Shen Zhu Ren, with the book that he wrote called Mr. Shen's Study of Xuan Kong, or \"Shen Shi Xuan Kong Xue\".\n\nFlying Star Feng Shui does not limit itself to buildings for the living or \"Yang Zhai\", where rules pertaining to directions equally apply to all built structures; it also applies to grave sites and buildings for spirits or \"Yin Zhai\".\n\nIn the Lo Shu Square, flying stars are nine numbers.\n\nEach number in the Lo Shu represents one of the Chinese Trigrams and is related to an Element, Family Member, Cardinal, Colour, Hour, Season, Organ, Ailments and many others.\n\nThe numbers always move to the lower right (northwest), middle right (west), lower left (northeast), upper center (south), lower center (north), upper right (southwest), middle left (east), upper left (southeast) and back to the center.\n\nTime is divided into 20-Year cycles. Each cycle of 20 years is a Period or \"Yun\". A grand cycle comprises 9 Periods in total which covers a span of 180 years.\n\nPeriods are used to describe the cyclical pattern of Qi. Different types of Qi have different strengths and weaknesses with the reference to a particular Period.\n\nPeriodic Table on Flying Stars\n\nA timely star is positive for a building whereas untimely star is negative. For the current period, \"Period 8\" (Year 2004–2023), stars \"Eight\", \"Nine\" and \"One\" are timely (For a building, they are timely if and only if the object placed in that palace is timely). Star \"Eight\" is most timely which is often treated as Prosperous and Noble Star. Star \"Nine\" and Star \"One\" belong to \"Sheng Qi\", a growing energy. The other six stars are regarded as having retreating, killing or dead \"qi\".\n\nAn accurate measurement of direction must be obtained before any system of Feng Shui can be undertaken.\n\nA Luopan is a magnetic compass to determine the precise direction of a structure or an item.\n\nThe most important ring on the Luopan is the 24 Mountain ring.\n\nOn the 24 Mountain ring, each direction is subdivided into three sectors.\n\nUsing the principles of Yin and Yang, the facing of a building is determined by the side of the built structure that receives most \"Yang Qi\".\n\nA house is constructed with an architectural frontage with its side that faces whatever landscape feature. The facing of that house is considered by the direction of its frontage which is most \"Yang\" in nature.\n\nIn apartments, or condominiums, the facing of a unit is determined by the facing of the entire building. If the structure is not an obvious facade, the facing of the unit is determined by the side of the building having the most \"Yang\" energy (faces the busiest crowd flow).\n\nEnergy in a building can be tapped into by locating a person within a sector that houses the energy. Ideally, living objects should be located in a sector with positive Qi as determined by Flying Star Chart.\n\nThe layout of a building is demarcated with a Nine Palace grid, which looks like a \"tic-tac-toe grid\". A door, room or other object's location refers to the square within this grid where the object is found. This may or may not correspond to the direction that the object faces. A door could be located in the southwest sector, but face south. Its location could be also southwest, and its direction to be facing to the south.\n\nObjects are essential to evaluate the Feng Shui of a building.\n\nMountain generates Qi. A lush and green mountain or hill generates auspicious Qi, while a barren, rocky rising area will, in general, generate inauspicious energy.\n\nIn urban areas, skyscrapers, apartments or any structure that rises from the ground have a similar role to a mountain: generating energy outside. From inside, cupboards, wardrobes, or any furniture that is taller or larger than any others nearby are also considered mountains.\n\nWater conducts Qi. It is essential to identify the cleanliness of the water, the location and the flow of the water formation. These include ponds, lakes, rivers, drains and fountains.\n\nIn urban areas, highways and lowland play a similar role to waterways, conducting Qi. Inside a building or a room, spinning fan or anything lower than ground level is considered water.\n\nNine Palace Flying Stars or \"Jiu Gong Fei Xing\" is another name of Flying Stars method whereby palaces are the nine sectors overlaid onto a layout of the house.\n\nA Flying Star chart consists of three numbers in each Palace of the Luo Shu. These numbers are called the Base Star, the Facing Star and the Sitting Star.\n\nConstructing a Flying Star Chart requires\n- The dates that the building was occupied by the owners\n- The facing of the building\n\nFor example, if a building is constructed in the year 2003, but the residents do not move in until February 4 of 2004, the Period of the building is 8, not 7.\n\nPeriod does not change again unless there is major renovation undertaken to the structure.\n\nCreating a \"Flying Star chart\" is always begun with the Base Star. Period of the building determines the number occupies the Base Star position of the \"Central Palace\". Base Stars always fly in the Luo Shu path.\n\nOnce all the base stars are distributed amongst the nine palaces, the number in Facing Palace on the Luo Shu grid is determined by the facing direction of the building. This number is the facing star.\n\nThe \"Sitting Palace\" is always opposite of the \"Facing Palace\". The sitting star is the number in the sitting palace.\n\nFor instance, in a Period-8 building that faces southwest, the number that locates in Facing Palace is number 5 whereas the number in Sitting Palace is number 2; thus, 5 is Facing Star and 2 is Sitting Star.\n\nUnlike the Base Star, the Facing Star and Sitting Star can fly in either ascending (\"Yang\") order, or descending (\"Yin\") order. The order depends upon two factors on \n1 Whether the star is an even number or an odd number, and \n2 Which the mountain that the unit faces.\n\nEven-numbered Stars follow a \"Yin-Yang-Yang\" form. In a certain number which comprises three mountains, should the mountain that the property faces is \"Yang\", then the numbers fly in ascending order of Lo Shu path, and vice versa.\n\nOdd-numbered Stars follow a \"Yang-Yin-Yin\" form. In a certain number which comprises three mountains, should the mountain that the property faces is \"Yang\", then the numbers fly in ascending order of Lo Shu path, and vice versa.\n\nTo determine the polarity of number 5 star, go by the polarity of the Period number.\n\nFlying stars can be timely or untimely. The nature of flying star depends on which period is to be referred and which star is being activated.\n\nResult of overcoming of untimely Flying Star 3 (Wood) upon Star 2 (Earth)\nRelationship: Son harassing mother-in-law, a male violating a woman\nActivities: Problems (Conflict, arguments, combat, lawsuit, disharmonies) for mother\nHealth: woman is hurt at the belly (while pregnant) or having stomachache\n\nResult of combination of untimely Flying Stars 2 (Earth) and 5 (Earth)\nActivities: Accidents, bankruptcy, haunted house, death \nHealth: Serious sickness, cancer of the digestive system\n\nResult of fire combination of untimely Flying Stars 2 (Earth) and 7 (Metal), or of untimely Flying Stars 7 (Metal) and 9 (Fire)\nRelationship: Lesbian, Male with strong female personalities\nActivities: Fire, explosion\n\nResult of combination of untimely Flying Stars 3 (Wood) and 7 (Metal)\nRelationship: Male and female fight\nActivities: Cripple, armed robbery, burglary, lawsuit, scams\nHealth: foot disease, liver cancer, arm injury by metal\n\nResult of combination of timely Flying Stars 1 (Water) and 4 (Wood), or combination of timely Flying Stars 3 (Wood) and 9 (Fire), or combination of timely Flying Stars 1 (Water) and 6 (Metal)\nActivities: Intelligence, Splendid for studies and research\n\nResult of metal combination of untimely Flying Stars 6 and 7.\nRelationship: combat and competition between brothers\nActivities: Conflict, armed robbery, death by metal\n\nResult of combination of timely Flying Stars 6 and 8, or timely Flying Stars 2 and 6\nActivities: Success in business, especially real estate or owning land, Inheritance, Great authority\n\nResult of combination of timely Flying Stars 8 (Earth) and 9 (Fire)\nActivities: Promotion, Marriage, Birth, Fame, Championship\n\nAccording to I-Ching, south direction belongs to fire. However, in a building, the south sector may not a fire. The nature of a palace depends on combination among elements of the \"base star\", of the \"sitting star\", of the \"facing star\" and of the \"Heaven Trigram\".\n\nFor example, a house that faces bearing 337.6 - 352.5 was built in 2001, and was occupied by residents in 2006.\n\nPeriod of the house: Period 8, since 2006 is the year of occupying\n\nFacing: Ren mountain in North direction, bearing 337.6 - 352.5\n\nSitting: Bing mountain in South direction, opposite of the facing\n\nTimely flying star is a catalyst to the phase combination of \"Sitting Star\", \"Facing Star\", \"Base Star\" and \"Heavenly Trigram\", implying whether to boost the current aura to best or to the opposite. For example, annual Star 1 (Water) has the ability to combat the competition of metallic stars 6 and 7.\n\nIn Sexagenary cycle, a new Chinese year begins on start of spring, which usually falls on February 4. The annual flying star that visits the center palace has to be subtracted by one every Chinese year. Once \"Star 1\" is reached, annual star would loop back around to 9 in next year. \n\n\"Star 1\" occupies center palace in 1999, 2008, 2017 and so on.\n\nAnnual and monthly stars always follow Lo Shu path.\n\nDaily Flying Stars are governed by,\n\nRULE 1: From the onset of Winter Solstice until Summer Solstice in the following year, the daily stars progress in ascending order (... 7,8,9,1, 2, 3, ...).

The stars are distributed around the nine palaces fleeing Lo Shu path.\n\nOn the very first Yang Wood Rat day or \"Jia-zi\" day after Summer Solstice, daily \"Star 9\" presides the center palace.\n\nBi-hourly Flying Stars are ruled by,\n\nRULE 1: From the onset of Winter Solstice until Summer Solstice in the following year, the bi-hourly stars are distributed around the nine palaces following Lo Shu path. The stars progress in ascending order every bi-hourly.\n\nOn Rat, Rabbit, Horse, and Rooster days, \"star 1\" occupies the center sector at Rat hour (11 pm of previous day – 1 am). On Ox, Dragon, Goat, and Dog days, \"star 4\" occupies the center sector at Rat hour.

{"id": "235662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235662", "title": "Goulash", "text": "Goulash\n\nGoulash ( ) is a stew of meat, usually seasoned with paprika and other spices. Originating from the medieval Hungary, goulash is a popular meal predominantly eaten in Central Europe but also in other parts of Europe.\n\nIts origin traces back to the 9th century to stews eaten by Hungarian shepherds. Back then, the cooked and flavored meat was dried with the help of the sun and packed into bags produced from sheep's stomachs, needing only water to make it into a meal. Earlier versions of goulash did not include paprika, as it was not introduced to the Old World until the 16th century. It is one of the national dishes of Hungary and a symbol of the country.\n\nThe name originates from the Hungarian \"\"gulyás\" . The word \"gulya\" means \"herd of cattle\"\" in Hungarian, and \"\"gulyás\"\" means \"herdsman\" or \"cowboy\".\n\nThe word gulyás originally meant only \"herdsman\", but over time the dish became gulyáshús (goulash meat) – that is to say, a meat dish which was prepared by herdsmen. Also in medieval times the Hungarian herdsman of Central Europe made use of every possible part of the animal, as was common practice. As meat was scarce, nearly all of the animal was often used to make the soup; even part of the hide that provided foot protection was considered a necessity. Today, gulyás refers both to the herdsmen, and to the soup. From the Middle Ages until well into the 19th century, the Puszta was the home of massive herds of cattle. They were driven, in their tens of thousands, to Europe’s biggest cattle markets in Moravia, Vienna, Nuremberg and Venice. The herdsmen made sure that there were always some cattle that had to be slaughtered along the way, the flesh of which provided them with gulyáshús.\n\nIn Hungarian cuisine, traditional \"\"Gulyásleves\" (literally \"goulash soup\"), \"bográcsgulyás\"\", pörkölt, and paprikás were thick stews made by cattle herders and stockmen. Garlic, caraway seed, bell pepper, and wine are optional. These dishes can be made as soups rather than stews. Excepting paprikás, the Hungarian stews do not rely on a flour or roux for thickening.\nTomato is a modern addition, totally unknown in the original recipe and in the whole Central European food culture until the first half of the twentieth century.\nGoulash is as well a fundamental part of Slovak cuisine, where is prepared in several different tastes too, mainly the same ones of Hungarian cuisine. Slovakia was an important part of the Kingdom of Hungary for several centuries, and the two cuisines have many common recipes.\n\nGoulash can be prepared from beef, veal, pork, or lamb. Typical cuts include the shank, shin, or shoulder; as a result, goulash derives its thickness from tough, well-exercised muscles rich in collagen, which is converted to gelatin during the cooking process. Meat is cut into chunks, seasoned with salt, and then browned with sliced onion in a pot with oil or lard. Paprika is added, along with water or stock, and the goulash is left to simmer. After cooking a while, garlic, whole or ground caraway seed, or soup vegetables like carrot, parsley root, peppers (green or bell pepper) and celery may be added. Other herbs and spices could also be added, especially chili pepper, bay leaf and thyme. Diced potatoes may be added, since they provide starch as they cook, which makes the goulash thicker and smoother. However, chili peppers and potatoes are post-16th century additions, unknown in the original recipe. A small amount of white wine or wine vinegar may also be added near the end of cooking to round the taste. Goulash may be served with small egg noodles called \"csipetke\". The name \"Csipetke\" comes from pinching small, fingernail-sized bits out of the dough (\"csipet\" =pinch) before adding them to the boiling soup.\n\nThe Hungarian cook Karoly Gundel claims that in a goulash recipe, meat should not be mixed with any grains or with potatoes, so if potatoes or noodles are used, the meat should be omitted. Given the large number of goulash variants, however, this dictum is dubious.\n\nHungarian goulash variations include:\nA thicker and richer goulash, similar to a stew, originally made with three kinds of meat, is called \"Székely gulyás\", named after the Hungarian writer, journalist and archivist József Székely (1825–1895).\n\n\"Paprikás krumpli\" is a traditional paprika-based potato stew with diced potatoes, onion, bell peppers, ground paprika and some bacon or sliced spicy sausage, like the smoked Debrecener, in lieu of beef.\n\nIn German-speaking countries this inexpensive peasant stew is made with sausage and known as Kartoffelgulasch (\"potato goulash\").\n\nThick stews similar to \"pörkölt\" and the original cattlemen stew are popular throughout almost all the former Austrian-Hungarian Empire, from Northeast Italy to the Carpathians. Like \"pörkölt,\" these stews are generally served with boiled or mashed potato, polenta, dumplings (e.g. \"nokedli\", or \"galuska\"), spätzle or, alternatively, as a stand-alone dish with bread.\n\nIn Vienna, the former center of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a special kind of goulash had been developed. The \"Wiener Saftgulasch\" or the \"Fiakergulasch\" on the menu in traditional restaurants is a rich \"pörkölt\"-like stew; more onions but no tomatoes or other vegetables are used, and it usually comes just with dark bread. A variation of the \"Wiener Saftgulasch\" is the \"Fiakergulasch\", which is served with fried egg, fried sausage, and dumplings named \"Semmelknödel\".\n\nGoulash () is also very popular in most parts of Croatia, especially north (Hrvatsko Zagorje) and Lika. It is considered to be part of traditional cuisine. In Gorski Kotar and Lika, deer and boar frequently replace beef (\"lovački gulaš\"). There is also a kind of goulash with porcini mushrooms (\"gulaš od vrganja\"). Bacon is an important ingredient.\n\nGulaš is often served with fuži, njoki, polenta or pasta. In Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian is augmented with vegetables. Green and red bell peppers and carrots are most commonly used. Sometimes one or more other kinds of meat are added, e.g., pork loin, bacon, or mutton. In Slovenia, they are known as \"perkelt,\" but are often referred to as \"goulash\" or a similar name.\n\nIn the Czech and Slovak Republics, goulash (Czech and Slovak: \"guláš\") is usually made with beef, although pork varieties exist, and served with bread dumplings (goulash with beef in Czech \"hovězí guláš s knedlíkem\", in Slovak \"hovädzí guláš s knedľou\"), in Slovakia more typically with bread. In pubs it is often garnished with slices of fresh onion, and is typically accompanied by beer. Beer can be also added to the stew in the process of cooking. Seasonal varieties of goulash include venison or wild boar goulashes. Another popular variant of \"guláš\" is \"segedínský guláš\" (\"Szeged goulash\"), with sauerkraut. \n\nIn Czech and Slovak slang, the word \"guláš\" means \"mishmash\", typically used as \"mít v tom guláš\": to be disoriented or to lack understanding of something.\n\nGerman \"Gulasch\" is either a beef (\"Rindergulasch\"), pork (\"Schweinegulasch\"), venison (\"Hirschgulasch\"), or wild boar (\"Wildschweingulasch\") stew that may include red wine and is usually served with potatoes (in the north), white rice or spirelli noodles (mostly in canteens), and dumplings (in the south). \"Gulaschsuppe\" (goulash soup) is the same concept served as a soup, usually with pieces of white bread.\n\nGoulash in Italy is eaten in the region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the autonomous region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, regions that had been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and still are in part culturally and linguistically Austrian. Here it is eaten as a regular Sunday dish. It can also, although less typically so, be found in the nearby Veneto. An interesting regional recipe comes from the Pustertal (Val Pusteria, Puster Valley) in South Tyrol. It is made of beef and red wine, and seasoned with rosemary, red paprika, bay leaf, marjoram and lemon zest, served with crusty white bread or polenta. The lemon gives its signature flavor. Goulash is also quite popular in the city of Ancona, which is culturally quite near to eastern Europe.\n\nIn Poland, goulash () is popular and eaten in most parts of the country. A variant dish exists that is similar to Hungarian pörkölt. It came to being around the 9th century. It is usually served with various forms of noodles and dumplings, such as pyzy.\n\nIn Serbia, goulash (Serbian: гулаш) is eaten in most parts of the country, especially in Vojvodina, where it was probably introduced by the Hungarian minority. It is actually a pörkölt like stew, usually made with beef, veal or pork, but also with game meat like venison, deer and boar. Compulsory ingredients are meat and onions, usually in 50-50% ratio, paprika, and lard or oil, other ingredients being optional: garlic, parsley, chilly pepper, black pepper, cinnamon, bell peppers, carrots, tomatoes, red wine, mushrooms, bacon. Sometimes, goulash is sweetened by adding tomato paste, sugar or dark chocolate at the very end. In Serbia, goulash is most often served with macaroni or potato mash.\n\nIn Slovene \"partizanski golaž\", \"partisan goulash\", favoured by Slovenian partisans during the Second World War, is still regularly served at mass public events. \"Partisan \"golaž\" utilizes onion in equal proportion to meat; Slovenians usually use two or more types of meat in cooking \"golaž\"\".\n\nAmerican goulash, mentioned in cookbooks since at least 1914, exists in a number of variant recipes. Originally a dish of seasoned beef, core ingredients of American goulash now usually include elbow macaroni, cubed steak, ground beef or \"hamburger\", and tomatoes in some form, whether canned whole, as tomato sauce, tomato soup, and/or tomato paste. In some areas it is called \"slumgullion\".\n\n\n\n"}

It encompasses research enabling access to cultural heritage, its conservation, interpretation and management.\n\nThe term has become widely used after 2006 when it became increasingly evident that the more traditional terms conservation science or preservation science inadequately reflected the breadth of research into cultural heritage. Heritage scientists in museums, galleries, libraries, archives, universities and research institutions support conservation (often called conservation science), access (e.g. development of new ICT tools), interpretation, including archaeometry and archaeological science (e.g. dating, provenancing, attribution), heritage management (e.g. development of tools and knowledge supporting strategic or environmental management decisions) and wider societal engagement with heritage (e.g. heritage values and ethics). Heritage science is also an excellent vehicle for public engagement with science as well as heritage.\n\nHeritage science is seen as \"key to the long-term sustainability of heritage: it is about managing change and risk and maximising social, cultural and economic benefit not just today, but in such a way that we can pass on to future generations that which we have inherited.\" Domains of research, where heritage science makes a particular input were recognised to be museums, galleries, libraries and archives; the built historic environment and archaeology, by the United Kingdom National Heritage Science Strategy documents.\n\nThe field still requires its literature canon and opinions on whether heritage science is a domain in its own right or a field of research diverge. However, this appears a matter of academic recognition, rather than a matter of research practice.\n\nHeritage science is an old field of research: in his Royal Institution Christmas Lecture in 1843, Michael Faraday already pointed out how pollution importantly contributes to book degradation. The following premises appear to be of defining importance:\n\nSince the context of heritage is often unknown, there can be any number of variables affecting the heritage system under observation – inductive reasoning is therefore often applied in heritage science. In this aspect, the premise of heritage science comes close to social science.\nHeritage that is accessible, in its preserved authentic form or as a (digital) reproduction, is a \"resource for economic growth, employment and social cohesion\". Through improved access, heritage science therefore contributes to well-being. Heritage science is proof that there is no world of 'Two Cultures'. A scientist, researching heritage defies the existence of the divide: there can be no scientific research of heritage without a contribution by humanities research. Heritage science also successfully bridges science and culture, because it provides an attractive vehicle to convey ideas and concepts related to technology and engineering, as well as culture and society. Heritage science can be considered an anthropogenic analog to environmental geography, which was defined by Halford Mackinder in 1887 as a discipline that aims to \"bridge one of the greatest of all gaps\" between \"the natural sciences and the study of humanity\". \n\nHeritage science is an increasingly lively science domain. Materials and techniques of the past are often very difficult to study and state-of-the-art techniques and methods need to be employed. Discoveries new to science are often the result of such endeavours, e.g. new antibiotics from bacteria discovered in the Cave of Altamira, in Spain. With its wide definition, heritage science spans a significant variety of scientific activities. In order to support conservation, access, interpretation and management, heritage science must be based on an interdisciplinary palette of knowledge, from fundamental sciences (chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology) to arts and humanities (conservation, archaeology, philosophy, ethics, history, art history etc.), including economics, sociology, computer sciences and engineering.\n\nIn academia, heritage science is often performed by scientists spending a proportion of their time on heritage-related research. The academic field, judged by the number of academic outputs published annually, is steadily increasing. This could be taken to estimate the domain size – with the number of outputs in 2014 being 6,800 (Source: Web of Science), it could be assumed that there are about 3,000 heritage scientists active in the field (publishing on average 2 academic publications per year). This goes against the generally held view that the field is small.\n\nThe proportion per country varies greatly, about 20% of researchers being active in the US, 15% in the UK, 10% in Italy, 5% France, and 5% in China (with a strong increase in the last decade).\n\nSince 2013, the scientific domain has its own flagship journal, \"Heritage Science\".\n\nIn 2013, the Mind the Gap project, funded by the UK EPSRC/AHRC Science and Heritage Programme, reported on the drivers and impediments in cross-disciplinary research. The project found that there is no gap between rigour and relevance in heritage science research but rather that there is a continuum of activity. However, there was less satisfaction with heritage science research in relation to its impact on practice, in comparison to its academic impact.\n\nThe heritage science career paths are various. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of heritage science, any academic background is suitable, from formal sciences, natural sciences to social sciences. \nMost researchers have entered the field by carrying out doctoral research in the field, which is due to the fact that there is currently no undergraduate course in this domain. Since 2010, Master's degree courses in heritage science have become available at University College London and Queens University Belfast. In Italy, students can obtain undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in conservation science at the University of Florence, University of Bologna, and a recently created programme at the University of Venice. Several other universities in Italy have faculty members whose primary research focus is in heritage science; these groups often accept international students who would like to obtain a PhD in the field. Taught courses in heritage science programmes include elements of heritage science, e.g. technical art history is often part of art history courses, and natural sciences are often taught in conservation courses. Brandenburg University of Technology in Germany offers the international Master's programme World Heritage Studies and PhD programme Heritage Studies.\n\nAt UCL, University of Oxford and University of Brighton, the Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology (SEAHA) was established in 2014. A key aspect of the SEAHA scheme is the collaborative nature of projects, enabling partnerships between academic institutions, industry and national heritage agencies and giving an applied focus to the research training.\n\nSince the field requires significant cross-disciplinary and transferrable skills, graduates may be able to take jobs in industry and academia. To work within the field of heritage science (e.g. in a museum laboratory), a PhD in the physical sciences and significant experience in a museum or conservation studio is typically required.\n\nMany major heritage institutions have heritage science departments:\n\nA UK body, the National Heritage Science Forum was established to enable the 'users' and 'doers' of heritage science to access information on heritage science research, to exchange knowledge and increase collaboration. In 2016, the forum had 20 institutional members.\n\nSeveral international professional associations have heritage science groups:\n\nThe Heritage Science Research Network captures the current activity in the field in the UK. In Spain, the Spanish Network of Science and Technology for the Conservation of Cultural Heritage (TechnoHeritage) brings together more than 65 research groups working in heritage science, from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), universities, conservation institutes and other cultural institutions. \n\nThe major heritage science events (conferences, symposia, meetings etc.) are:\nIn addition, conferences organised by the Institute of Conservation, American Institute for Conservation and International Institute for Conservation usually feature heritage science sessions and talks.\n\nJournals often or exclusively publishing academic papers in heritage science:\n"}
{"id": "39693193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39693193", "title": "Hookup culture", "text": "Hookup culture\n\nA hookup culture is one that accepts and encourages casual sexual encounters, including one-night stands and other related activity, without necessarily including emotional bonding or long-term commitment. It is generally associated with Western late adolescent behavior and, in particular, American college culture. The term hookup has an ambiguous definition because it can indicate kissing or any form of physical sexual activity between sexual partners. The term has been widely used in the USA since at least 2000. It has also been called nonrelationship sex, or sex without dating.\n\nMost research on hookups has been focused on American college students, but hookups are not limited to college campuses. Adolescents and emerging adults engage in hookups for a variety of reasons, which may range from instant physical gratification, to fulfillment of emotional needs, to using it as a means of finding a long-term romantic partner. Media reaction to hookup culture has been dismissed as moral panic. The recent introduction of mobile hookup apps and websites have shaped hookup culture, especially among gay men.\n\nThe rise of hookups, a form of casual sex, has been described by evolutionary biologist Justin Garcia and others as a \"cultural revolution\" that had its beginnings in the 1920s. Historians D'Emilio and Freedman put the beginning of casual sex, including college hookups, further back in history, to the early 1800s, and explain the phenomenon as shaped by historical and cultural forces. They give as examples planter class white men who had casual sex with enslaved African American women, and white male college students who had casual sex with both white and black women. Lisa Wade, a sociologist, documents that 19th century white fraternity men often had what would be called hookup sex with prostitutes, poor women, and the women they had enslaved. Homosexual men also engaged in hookup sex during the 1800s, meeting in spaces that were transient in nature, such as wharves and boarding houses. Since the 1920s, there has been a transition from an age of courtship to an era of hookup culture. Technological advancements such as the automobile and movie theaters brought young couples out of their parents' homes, and out from their watchful eyes, giving them more freedom and more opportunity to engage in casual sexual activity.\n\nThe sexual revolution of the 1960s brought a loosening of sexual morals which allowed for sex to become uncoupled from relationships and non-marital sex to become more socially acceptable. Some scholars, including Garcia and Freitas, have found that dating, while it has not disappeared, has decreased as the frequency of hookups have increased. By the mid-1990s, Freitas found that hookups were an accepted form of interactions among sexually active adults especially those located on college campuses.\n\nAccording to a review by Garcia, this is \"an unprecedented time in the history of human sexuality.\" People are marrying and beginning families at ages later than previous generations while becoming sexually mature at an earlier age. As a result, Garcia and other scholars argue that young adults are able to reproduce physiologically but are not psychologically or socially ready to 'settle down' and begin a family.\n\nThese developmental shifts, Garcia's systematic review of the literature suggests, is one of the factors driving the increase in hookups, a \"popular cultural change that has infiltrated the lives of emerging adults throughout the Western world.\" The review shows that hookups are becoming increasingly normative among young adults and adolescents in North America and have taken root throughout the Western world, which represents a notable shift in how casual sex is perceived and accepted.\n\nGarcia and others have noted that the \"past decade has witnessed an explosion in interest in the topic of hookups, both scientifically and in the popular media. Research on hookups is not seated within a singular disciplinary sphere; it sits at the crossroads of theoretical and empirical ideas drawn from a diverse range of fields, including psychology, anthropology, sociology, biology, medicine, and public health.\" Difficulties in defining the term can lead to different perceptions of its prevalence. The hookup culture is vaguely defined due to a variety of perspectives taken on this subject related human sexuality. It is hard to make sense of the hookup culture with understanding why it exists in society and why individuals participate in the culture.\n\nAccording to Shannon T. Boodram, \"hooking up is nothing more than settling; it is the microwaveable burrito of sex.\" Hooking up is engaged in for the instant gratification for sex, pleasure, a feeling of being loved, an emotional feeling of being adhered to, the thought of the potential of the hook up developing into something less casual, and many more reasons.\n\nAccording to Kathleen Bogle, the phrase 'hooking up' is \"a slang term\" deemed unofficial and unpredictable due to the extended variation of its meaning. Many other slang terms for hooking up were and still are used such as \"friends with benefits\" and \"booty call.\" Other terms for repeated acts of hooking up include, \"casual sex\" or \"recreational sex,\" or defined as a relationship with \"no strings attached.\"\n\nThe definition of hooking up can vary depending on the person or on the age group. It can range from acts that involve kissing, oral sex, or intercourse. The term \"hooking up\", meaning an instance of casual sex, differs from hook up \"culture\". A hook up is an act that involves sexual intimacy, claimed by many to be a sexually liberating act. On the other hand, hook up culture is thought to be oppressive and monolithic, with intimacy only occurring within a specific context. Jennifer Aubrey and Siobhan Smith have found that between genders there are minimal differences when it comes to behavior and frequency in hookups; on the other hand, women still face a harder social stigma, because their social status decreases with increased sexual partners, while men's social status increases with more sexual partners\".\" In a study conducted by Danielle M. Currier, she explores how the phrase \"hooking up\" conveys different meanings depending on whether a man or woman uses it when describing their sexual encounters; furthermore, Currier notes that men use \"hooking up\" to emphasize their masculinity and heterosexuality whereas women use the phrase to preserve their femininity by being strategically ambiguous in order to downplay their sexual desires.\n\nSome North American surveys published in the mid-2000s have shown that upwards of 60% or 70% of sexually active teens reported having had uncommitted sex within the last year. This is more common among boys than girls. Among sexually experienced adolescents, 28% of boys and 16% of girls reported losing their virginity to either someone they have just met, or to a friend who is not a dating partner.\n\nBoys are more likely than girls to have several hookup partners at the same time, and are also more likely to hook up with someone they are not dating. For both genders, hookups are more likely to be with an ex-boyfriend, an ex-girlfriend or a friend than with an acquaintance. The majority of teens (68%) who hook up with a friend or an ex will hook up with them again.\n\nAbout half of all hookups among adolescents were a one time affair, and this is the same for both boys and girls. Only 6% of teens have had sex with someone they just met, and these encounters are a one time affair 75% of the time. Over all, 25% of those who had sexual experience with a dating partner have also hooked up with someone they were not dating. Additionally, 40% of those who had hooked up with someone they were not dating had also hooked up with a dating partner in the previous 12 months.\n\nStudies have shown that most high school girls are more interested in a relationship compared to high school boys, who are mostly interested in sex. Young women tend to be honest about their sexual encounters and experiences, while young men tend to lie more often about theirs. Another study shows that once a person has sex for their first time, it becomes less of an issue or big deal to future relationships or hook ups. During this study, it was shown that girls in high school do not care as much as boys do on having sex in a relationship. But, on the contrary girls will have sex with their partner in order to match them.\n\nFor some adolescents, sex and relationships have been decoupled.\n\nSome worry that if society disconnects intimate sexual behavior and emotional connection, teens who hook up will have trouble forming stable intimate relationships later in life.\n\nJournalist Sabrina Weill asserts that \"casual teen attitudes toward sex—particularly oral sex—reflect their confusion about what is normal behavior,\" and adds that they \"are facing an intimacy crisis that could haunt them in future relationships. 'When teenagers fool around before they're ready or have a very casual attitude toward sex, they proceed toward adulthood with a lack of understanding about intimacy.'\"\n\nHistorical research documents that white male college students have a long history of engaging in hookup sex. Journals and letters from the 1800's demonstrate that wealthy young white male college students hooked up with prostitutes, poor women, and enslaved African American women. \n\nToday, according to one study the vast majority, more than 90% of American college students say their campus is characterized by a hookup culture, and students believe that about 85% of their classmates have hooked up. Studies show that most students (most recent data suggest between 60% and 80%) do have some sort of casual sex experience. Of those students who have hooked up, between 30% and 50% report that their hookups included sexual intercourse. Nationally, women now outnumber men in college enrollment by 4 to 3, leading some researchers to argue that the gender imbalance fosters a culture of hooking up because men, as the minority and limiting factor, hold more power in the sexual marketplace and use it to pursue their preference of casual sex over long-term relationships.\n\nHowever, most students overestimate the amount of hookups in which their peers engage. Only 20% of students regularly hookup. Roughly one half will occasionally hookup, and one-third of students do not hook up at all. The median number of hookups for a graduating senior on a college campus is seven, and the typical college student acquires two new sexual partners during their college career. Half of all hookups are repeats, and 25% of students will graduate from college a virgin. African American women students are less likely to engage in hookup sex than white women students. \n\nOne study has found that the strongest predictor of hookup behavior was previous experience hooking up. Those who have engaged in hookups that involve penetrative sex are 600% more likely to hookup again during the same semester.\n\nSubculture can affect gender roles and sexuality, and youth subcultures are particularly susceptible to peer pressure. Self-esteem is also an indicator: men with high self-esteem and women with low self-esteem are more likely to have multiple sexual partners, but hookups are less likely among both genders when they have high self-esteem. Most predictors among males and females rarely differ.\n\nOne third of gay and bisexual college men have met an anonymous sexual partner in a public place such as a park, bookstore, or restroom. Other venues such as public cruising areas, Internet cruising networks, and bathhouses are popular for gay men, but not for lesbians or heterosexuals.\n\nThe trend toward marrying later may be what is fueling the hookup scene on college campuses. At colleges, hookups are common between students at parties, in dormitories and fraternity houses, at surrounding bars and clubs, and at popular student vacation destinations. For example, a study of Canadian college students who planned to hook up while on spring break showed that 61% of men and 34% of women had sex within a day of meeting their partner.\n\nAnother study was based on a survey of over 18,000 college students from ages 18–25. This survey asked questions like how many sexual partners they have had since graduating high school, how many sexual partners per year, and how many times per week they have sex. It was reported that a little over 59% of college students have sex once per week. A little over 31% reported to having at least one sexual partner per year, and about 50% said that they have had more than two sexual partners since the age of 18. Perceptions of \"frat boys\" and how this stereotype seems to be the typical male how only pursues women to have sexual relations. Many female college students explained how the \"frat boy\" perfectly embodies the persona of a sex driven male.\n\nHooking up generally refers to having sex; however, many others indicated that when they say hooking up they are referring to something less than intercourse. In a hookup culture, young people often have little experience with dating and developing romantic relationships. Hooking up is means for experiencing casual sexual encounters, but it is also means for beginning relationships. Students often feel that hookups are the only option, and that their peers do not date, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy as fewer students date because they believe their classmates do not believe in dating. Freitas' study has found that students on these campuses generally feel that the decision about whether or not to be in a relationship is out of their control and that \"hookup culture dictated for them that there would be no dating, and that they simply had to endure this reality.\"\n\nKimmel believes that while sexual promiscuity once existed on college campuses alongside more traditional forms of dating, hooking up is now \"the alpha and omega of young adult romance.\" Wade, on the other hand, says that college students are merely engaging in a different form of courtship that often results in monogamous relationships. This view is echoed by Armstrong, Hamilton, and England, who state that college students have not abandoned dating. Some students claim that hook ups fit their busy personal and professional schedules better than traditional dating does and is thus liberating. Freitas counters that living in the hookup culture is not at all liberating if what students want is to actually go on dates.\n\nFreitas has opined that a \"hookup is a sexual act that thwarts meaning, purpose, and relationship.\" However, most students do want to be in a romantic relationship. One study has found that 63% of college-aged men and 83% of college-aged women would prefer a traditional romantic relationship at their current stage in life to casual sex. Additionally, 95% of women and 77% of men say they prefer dating to hooking up. \"Without exception,\" sex counselor Ian Kerner has says, students \"discuss a long-term monogamous relationship as their desired end goal.\" While more than half of students of both genders say they would like a hook up to develop into a romantic relationship, only 6.5% (4.4% of men and 8.2% of women) expect that one will. Half of women, 51%, and 42% of men, have tried discussing the possibility of beginning a romantic relationship with a hookup partner.\n\nMore than half of college relationships begin with a hookup, Bogle's research has found. Freitas's study shows that when a relationship is born of a hookup, it is usually after months of engaging is a serial hookup. Relationships that begin as a hookup, or as a \"friends with benefits\" situation, report lower levels of satisfaction. Garcia says that hookup culture can lead to a lower incidence of dating among youth, but as people get a bit older they outgrow their desire for hookups and settle into traditional dating.\n\nOftentimes, men and women seem to not be on the \"same page.\" According to Bogle, many males believed that females often invested themselves or had an ulterior motive for pursuing a hookup like situation. For instance, when a male student was asked if he felt that women looked for different components in a hookup; his response was that most females generally did not lean towards a \"one and done\" thing.\n\nSociologist Wade discusses several scholars who disagree that contemporary college students desire long-term monogamous relationships. She cites Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton, Hanna Rosin, and Kate Taylor who posit that hookup culture is good for women as it frees them to focus on their studies and on their professional develop for careers instead of seeking a long term partner or marriage.\n\nFreitas believes the lessons imparted by hookup culture have \"set back\" students who often have little experience dating, and few skills in asking a romantic partner out as a result. There has been such a decline in dating culture on college campuses that most students have had more hookups than first dates. On some campuses, dating is so rare that many students do not have the skills to know how to ask someone out. Boston College even offers a course on how to plan and execute a date.\n\nGarcia's review has found that hookups can result in emotional and psychological injury, sexual violence, sexually transmitted infections, and/or unintended pregnancy. Most students report with not concerning themselves with or being concerned about the health risks that come with hookups, however, especially if their partner was a member of their own community, such as a student on the same college campus. Garcia notes that there can be a lot of pressure when it comes to hooking up which can contribute to discomfort, performance anxiety, and stress. \n\nSome studies have found that students, both men and women, overwhelmingly regret their hookups. In one, 77% of students regretted their hookups, and in another 78% of women and 72% of men who had uncommitted vaginal, anal, and/or oral sex regretted the experience. Intercourse that occurred less than 24 hours after meeting, and those that took place only one time are the most likely to be regretted. Men were more likely to be sorry for having used another person, and women regretted the experience because they felt they had been used. While women usually feel worse after a hook up than men do, 39% of men expressed extreme regret, shame, and frustration with themselves about their hookup experiences.\n\nOther studies found that many college students do not regret their hookup experiences. Wade interviewed many women and men who were enthusiastic about their hookup experiences. Vrangalova and Ong's study documented that students who had a stable personality orientation towards casual sex reported a heightened sense of well being after experiencing casual sex. \n\nSome research shows that hook up regret is gendered, with women tending to regret hooking up much more than men do. According to one study of 832 college students, 26% of women and 50% of men reported positive emotional reactions following a hookup and 49% of women and 26% of men reported negative reactions following a hook up. According to \"Explaining Gender Differences in Hookup Regret\", there are at least four explanations for why women may regret hookups more than men: (1) They may have different attitudes towards relationships, hooking up, and sex; (2) there may be differences in sexual initiation and agency within hookups; (3) there may be differences in the frequency of orgasm within hookups; and (4) there may be differences in perceived inequality in orgasms during hookups. Other studies, such as Vrangalova and Ong, found no gender difference.\n\nRegret from hooking up may be linked to negative emotional outcomes, especially in women. According to an article by Steven E. Rhoads, Laura Webber, et al., \"the more partners women have in the course of their lives, the more likely they are to be depressed, to cry almost every day, and to report relatively low satisfaction with their lives. In \"Premarital Sex in America: How Young Americans Meet, Mate, and Think About Marrying,\" Mark Regnerus and Jeremy Uecker report that having more sexual partners is associated with \"poorer emotional states in women, but not in men.\"\n\nThe American Psychological Association also says that hookups can result in guilt and negative feelings. In a study of 169 sexually experienced men and women surveyed in singles bars, when presented with the statement, \"I feel guilty or would feel guilty about having sexual intercourse with someone I had just met,\" 32 percent of men and 72 percent of women agreed (Herold & Mewhinney, 1993).\n\nStudents who reported to Freitas that they were profoundly upset about hooking up say the encounters made them feel, among other things, used, miserable, disgusted, and duped. In order to avoid becoming a victim, experts believe \"that the first step is to acknowledge the dangers inherent in the free-and-easy hookup approach to dating and sex.\" In one qualitative study, only 2% felt desirable or wanted after a hookup. More than a third, on the other hand, felt regretful or disappointed, and others reported feeling nervous or uncomfortable as well.\n\nCollege students base their sexual ideas and sexual actions within a peer culture. This is where students who are peers are comparing and differing sexual situations in one's own life amongst each other to create a foundation for the current hookup culture. Kathleen A. Bogle describes the peer culture at universities as the \"sexual arena.\" College students on campuses are able to create and explore their own sexual beings in life by referencing others' intimacy, which tends to be presented publicly.\n\nThis peer culture is not only amongst college students, but it may start to develop around the time puberty starts in middle school for both genders around the age of eleven to fourteen years old. In general, puberty is a time when sexuality and body awareness becomes a main focus for individuals to formulate this aspect of their identity. Once in college, for most students, the parental aspect is diminished leaving a student feeling a high degree of freedom to truly explore and expand their whole personal identity, strongly including sexual identity in this \"sexual arena.\"\n\nAccording to Bogle, the campuses her studies were done at had a common trend of college students being strongly interested in every other student's private life. This awareness of all the happenings in other students' lives closed the doored for true privacy, and made the college scene an open door in looking at others' relationships and sexual intimacy. College is a highly public environment, any kind of sexual activity or public display of affection at parties or on campus are exposed to others. The viewers of this activity process, interpret, and form assumptions about what was observed. These types of sexual activity or public displays of affection could be as meaningless as two individuals romantically speaking to each other in a high capacity location on campus or could be as extreme as two individuals walking into a bedroom together at a party.\n\nThis peer culture has evolved and escalated with access to rapid communication such as texting on cell phones and multiple social media applications. Most these social media applications are identity profiles, public thought disposals, and virtual photo albums of oneself, where other's are just a click away from cyber analysis of how that individual displays themselves physically, sexually, psychologically, emotionally, and mentally on the internet. Bogle states that the knowing of other's personal lives isn't just a purpose to gossip, but a way to observe, analyze, and be impacted by other's sexual actions, solely for the purpose of their own actions. A peer culture is where norms surface because individuals begin to conduct themselves in the same manner that their peers do, which creates this typical and common style of acquitting oneself.\n\nSome studies have made a connection between hookup culture and substance use. A majority of students said that their hookups occurred after drinking alcohol. Frietas has said that in her study the relationship between drinking and the party scene, and between alcohol and hookup culture, was \"impossible to miss.\" Hookups \"almost always\" occur when at least one participant is drunk according to Kimmel. On average, men have five drinks when they hookup, and women three. Students who reported using marijuana or cocaine in the past year were also more likely than their peers to have hooked up during that period.\n\nAbout a third of the students who reported engaging in vaginal, anal, or oral sex during a hookup reported being very intoxicated and another third reported being mildly intoxicated. Alcohol can act as a cue regarding sexual availability, as a disinhibitor, and as a rationalization or excuse for their behavior, poor sexual performance, premature ejaculation, and other sexual dysfunctions. It also is the \"liquid courage\" that allows them to make a sexual advance in the first place.\n\nStudies suggest that the degree of alcoholic intoxication directly correlates with the level of risky behavior. In one study, 33% of those who had hooked up indicated that it was \"unintentional,\" and likely due to the influence of alcohol or other drugs. In a survey of first-year students, women said that 64% of their hookups came after drinking alcohol. These results were similar to another study which found that 61% of all undergraduates reported drinking alcohol before their last hookup.\n\nStudies have generally shown that greater alcohol use is associated with more sexual activity in the course of a hookup. The students who reported the least amount of alcohol consumption were also the least likely to hook up. At the other end of the spectrum, the greatest alcohol consumption was associated with penetrative sex, and less alcohol consumption with non-penatrative hookups. Of those who took part in a hook up that included vaginal, anal, or oral sex, 35% were very intoxicated, 27% were mildly intoxicated, 27% were sober and 9% were extremely intoxicated.\n\nHookup culture on college campuses is intertwined with a broader society. On the other hand, some sociologists have argued that hookup culture is a characteristic of the American college environment and does not reflect broader American youth culture, just as many college graduates stop engaging in hookups when they leave college preferring instead dating or other sexual arrangements. Others, including Michael Kimmel, have said that \"the hookup culture can extend for years\" beyond college, \"well into their thirties and even their forties.\" Baby Boomer fears of hookup culture have been termed a \"moral panic\". Until recently, those who studied the rise of hookup culture had generally assumed that it was driven by men, and that women were reluctant participants, more interested in romance than in casual sexual encounters. But evidence exists that young women are propelling it too.\n\nHookup culture also exists outside of the college environment. Location-based geosocial networking smartphone applications, a.k.a. hookup apps or dating apps, are increasingly being used to locate potential hookups. Men who have sex with men (MSM) commonly use mobile dating apps designed for the gay male market such as Grindr, Jack'd, and SCRUFF to find hookup partners. One study noted that gay men's increased use of mobile hook-up apps has eroded gay public life, especially for those gay men who are on the urban margins in terms of social class and generation. Hook-up apps designed for heterosexuals emerged after the gay-oriented Grindr; Tinder, for example, was introduced in 2013. There have been a variety of dating apps for women who identify as lesbian, but they have been criticized for merely being \"reskins\" of successful hookup apps for gay men. Daatch is described as one of the few successful hookup apps designed for lesbians.\n\nLife course studies indicate that as people grow older and as they subjectively identify as adult, they are less likely to engage in casual sexual behavior. However, social scientists recognize that there is little scientific research on older people's sex lives, so no definitive conclusions may be drawn. \n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics has argued that media representations of sexuality may influence teen sexual behavior, and this view is supported by a number of studies. Some studies suggest that teens who watch movies with more sexual content tend to become sexually active at an earlier age, and engage in riskier sexual behaviors. The idea is that the media may serve as a \"super peer\" for youth, who then seek to develop a sexual identity that is in line with popular portrayals. On the other side, conservatives opposed to hookup culture have sparked controversy and come under criticism.\n\nCable television is filled with reality shows that depict an image of partying and glorified hookups, one of the most well known shows being MTV's Jersey Shore. Studies have found that about 35% of sexual behavior on cable television is with people \"who are not in established committed relationships\". In television sexual monogamy differs from gender, suggesting men stray away from commitment, while women desire it. Further suggesting masculinity is equal to sex, possibly leading male viewers to be more accepting of hookup culture.\n\nAs the cost of personal computers dropped and online access has increased, Heldman and Wade, along with others, argue that internet pornography has \"emerged as a primary influence on young people's, especially men's, attitudes towards sex and their own sexuality.\" Heldman and Wade believe that the increase of access to pornography via the internet is what \"spurred\" hookup culture, in part by challenging the idea that \"good sex\" takes place in a monogamous relationship. Feminist Gail Dines has opined that pornography is \"a cultural force that is shaping the sexual attitudes of an entire generation\" and a \"major form of sex ed today for boys.\"\n\nThere are many ideas as to why people think young adults are involved in this hook up culture, such as that they feel like they have to do it to fit in. Some girls also reported that the main reason they are involved with random hook ups is because they think that is what boys want. The feeling of being wanted by a cute guy is what they want and hook ups are how girls think they can get that attention. However, many boys and girls did report that they do hook up with random people in order to find someone they could possibly start something serious with. That being said not all young adults are hooking up with each other to fit the college norm, and gain sexual pleasure, but because they truly want to find someone they have a serious connection with. There was a study by University of Louisville researchers Owen and Fincham, who asked 500 undergraduate students that have been involved in hook up culture how they felt about commitment, and about 45% of men and 65% of women said they wanted their hook ups to possibly end up in a serious relationship.\n\nThere have also been a number of studies that have studied the mental aspects of casual hookups. In a study done by psychologist Seth Schwartz has shown results that say that people who had many random hook ups had more psychological issues. For instance, students in college that had stated they were involved in casual sex had higher levels of depression and anxiety and lower levels of self-esteem, happiness and life satisfaction compared to the students who did not engage in a casual hook up in the past thirty days. There was then a study of about 400 young adults that felt lonely and depressed and adults who had less feeling of loneliness and depression who were involved in sexual intercourse. They then researched what emotional affects being involved in sexual intercourse hookups had on them. They then came up with results that showed that penetrative sex hook ups made people with greater feelings of depression and loneliness have a decrease in those symptoms and feelings. Whereas people who expressed less symptoms of loneliness and depression had an increase in those feelings after a penetrative sex hook up. Not only does it make people feel depressed but it makes them feel uncomfortable. For example, a study by Reiber and Garcia in 2010 show that a lot of people that engage in sexual hook ups feel uncomfortable. They also came to a conclusion that 78% of people in a hook up overestimate how comfortable their partner is doing certain things during their sexual engagement. Random hook ups also have shown to cause feelings of pressure and performance anxiety in a study by Paul, et al.\n\nTotal number of sex partners among U.S. young adults since age 18:\n\nIn this research it was demonstrated that the number of sex partners people have nowadays has barely any difference to the number of partners people had twenty to thirty years ago.\n\n\n"}

Most speakers are monolingual, and their number is growing. Other peoples in the western Lakes Plain area speak basic Iau. Iau is tonal.\n\nDialects are Foi (Poi), Turu, Edopi (Elopi), and Iau proper; these may be distinct enough to be considered separate languages. Foi is spoken on the large Tariku River (Rouffaer River), Turu on the Van Daalen River, Iau proper between the rivers, and Edopi at the juncture of the Tariku and Kliki (Fou) rivers.\n\nAnother name for the language is Urundi ~ Ururi. Dosobou (Dou, Doufou) is specifically Edopi.\n\nThe following discussion is based on Bateman (1990a).\n\nThere are six consonants. /t d/ are dental; /s/ is alveolar. /b d/ are implosive, and may be realized as nasals before the low nasal vowel /ã/. /d/ may also be realized as the liquid [l].\n\n/f/ is pronounced [ɸ]~[h] word-initially, or as [x] before the high nonback vowels /i ɨ/. The labial allophone [ɸ] is preferred in the Foi dialect; the glottal allophone [h] is preferred in Turu. It is always pronounced [h] word-medially and as an unreleased plosive [p̚] word-finally. /f/ is the only consonant that can occur word-finally.\n\nThe low vowel is always nasalized, except when it is a component of a diphthong. The open-mid front vowel varies between [e], [ɛ], and [æ].\n\nThe following diphthongs exist:\n\nNo diphthongs begin with /ɪ i i̝/ or end in /a ɔ/.\n\nThere are two triphthongs: /aui/ and /aʊɪ/. The back components of these triphthongs are realized as unrounded.\n\nSyllables consist minimally of a vowel. They may include a single onset consonant and/or a single coda consonant. Diphthongs and triphthongs are attested. The template is (C)(V)V(V)(C). The tone-bearing unit is the syllable.\n\nStress in Iau is predictable: it falls on the final syllable of disyllabic words. (Words may not be longer than two syllables.) The interaction between stress and tone is not clear.\n\nThere are eight tones in Iau: two level tones (low and high), two rising tones (low rising and high rising), three falling tones (high-low, high-mid, and mid-low), and one falling-rising tone.\n\nTone is only lexical on nouns; the lexical forms of verbs are unmarked for tone, and each tone represents a different aspect. The complex system of aspectual marking via tone is discussed in Bateman (1986).\n\nA sequence of two tones (called a tone cluster) may occur on one syllable. There are eleven tone clusters that can occur on verbs to mark aspect; only three of these can occur on nouns.\n\n"}
{"id": "4561407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4561407", "title": "Juramentado", "text": "Juramentado\n\nJuramentado, in Philippine history, refers to a male Moro swordsman who attacked and killed targeted occupying and invading police and soldiers, expecting to be killed himself, the martyrdom undertaken as a form of jihad, considered a form of suicide attack. Unlike an amok, who commits acts of random violence against Muslims and non-Muslims alike, a juramentado was a dedicated, premeditated, and sometimes highly skilled killer who prepared himself through a ritual of binding, shaving, and prayer in order to accomplish brazen attacks armed only with edged weapons.\n\nFor generations warlike Moro tribes had successfully prevented Spain from fully controlling the areas around Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, developing a well-earned reputation as notorious seafaring raiders, adept naval tacticians, and ferocious warriors who frequently demonstrated extraordinary personal bravery in combat. While Moro forces could never match opponents' firepower or armor, such bands used intelligence, audacity and mobility to raid strongly defended targets and quickly defeat more vulnerable ones. One extreme asymmetric warfare tactic was the Moro juramentado.\n\nJuramentado is an archaic term derived from the Spanish word \"juramentar\", meaning one who takes an oath. Some sources link amoks (from the Malayan term for \"out of control\") and juramentados as similar culture-specific syndromes while others draw distinctions of religious preparation and state of mind. A Moro might be said to have \"gone juramentado\" or be \"running juramentado.\"\n\nU.S. Army officers who had served in Moroland incorporated the idiom into their own vocabulary, but often simply equated it with the Moro people as a whole. In his memoirs, Army Air Service advocate Benjamin D. Foulois said of volatile rival Army Air Service officer Billy Mitchell, \"He had become fanatic much in the way that the Moros were in the Philippines. He had become a \"juramentado\" and was ready to run amok.\"\n\nThe term juramentado was coined by José Malcampo, in command during the Spanish occupation of Jolo Island in 1876, but Moros had been making such personal attacks for many years. By the time of the Spanish–American War juramentados were being discussed in the American media, some official sources finding few documented cases. By 1903, local United States Army commander Leonard Wood sent a report to Governor of the Philippines William Howard Taft indicating juramentados were \"an oft repeated offense.\" Almost forty years later, on the eve of the Japanese invasion of the Philippine Islands beginning the Second World War, Time Magazine was reporting juramentado attacks in Jolo occurring \"once every other day\".\n\nThe Moro juramentados performed suicide attacks against Japanese troops. The Japanese were among several enemies the Moros juramentados launched suicide attacks against, the others being the Spanish, Americans and Filipinos, while the Moros did not ever attack the Chinese since the Chinese were not considered enemies of the Moro people. The Japanese responded to these suicide attacks by massacring all the relatives of the attacker.\n\nThe reason for the less usable .38 Long Colt being phased out and replaced by the .45 Colt as well as the very invention of the words for the concept \"stopping power\" were due to Moro juramentados.\n\nThe juramentado suicide charges were started by the Moros in the late 19th century to compensate after 1876 when they suffered reprisals from modern gunboats run by steam used by the Spanish.\n\nCandidates, known as \"mag-sabil\", \"who endure the pangs of death,\" were selected from Muslim youth inspired to martyrdom by the teaching of Imams. Parents were consulted before the young men were permitted by the sultan to undergo training and preparation for \"Parang-sabil\" (the path to Paradise). After an oath taken, hand on the Qur'an, the chosen took a ritual bath, all body hair was shaved, and the eyebrows trimmed to resemble \"a moon two days old.\" A strong band was wrapped firmly around the waist, and cords wrapped tightly around the genitals, ankles, knees, upper thighs, wrists, elbows, and shoulders, restricting blood flow and preventing the \"mag-sabil\" from losing too much blood from injury before reaching their target. Clad in white robe and turban, the chosen youth would polish and sharpen his weapons before action.\n\nAt the moment of attack, the \"mag-sabil\" would approach a large group of enemies, shout \"La ilaha il-la'l-lahu\" (\"There is no god but Allah\"), draw kris or barong and then rush into the group swinging his sword, killing and maiming as many victims as possible in the time he had left. The \"mag-sabil's\" body would be washed and again wrapped in white for burial. In the unlikely event the \"mag-sabil\" survived his attack, it was believed his body would ascend to Paradise after 40 years had passed.\n\nThe Moros' use of local intelligence to mark target situations, coupled with a keen understanding of the tactical element of surprise made combating juramentado warriors difficult for Spanish troops during its long attempt to occupy the Sulu Archipelago. In an era of warfare where body armor had become anachronistic, an unexpected melee attack with razor-sharp blades was a devastating tactic against veteran soldiers. Even when colonizers had time to draw weapons and fire on the charging attacker, the small caliber weapons commonly in use possessed no stopping power, bullets passing through limbs and torso, the juramentados' ritual binding working as a set of tourniquets to prevent the swordsman from bleeding out from wounds before accomplishing his purpose.\n\nIn 1983, the American journalist Daniel P. Mannix released an edited version of the autobiography of his father, Rear Admiral Daniel P Mannix the 3rd. The book, called \"The Old Navy: The Glorious Heritage of the U.S. Navy, Recounted through the Journals of an American Patriot\", included the following paragraph:\n\nVic Hurley, an American author who was a member of the Philippine Constabulary, wrote the book Jungle Patrol in 1938, arguing that Colonel Alexander Rodgers of the 6th Cavalry Regiment (brother of Thomas S. Rodgers) had implemented the strategy of mass graves and pig entrails:\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks on the United States, a number of American urban legends began circulating that John J. Pershing had ordered the summary execution of captured enemies using bullets laced with pig blood, and whose bodies were placed in a mass grave filled with pig entrails. Dr. Frank E. Vandiver, professor of history at Texas A&M University and author of \"Black Jack: The Life and Times of John J. Pershing\" said about the burial of Juramentados with pig remains that he never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences, and that such an event would be out of keeping with Pershing's character. Rather, most sources indicate the idea of using pigs was suggested to Pershing but he rejected it.\n\nYet John Pershing did not say that he had ordered the practice, but that « the army had already adopted » the practice, and that « it was not pleasant », as he states quite clearly in his \"Memoir\": \n\nIn the 2013 publishing of his \"Memoir\", a footnote cites a letter from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell to J. Pershing: \n\nM1911 was developed in order to nullify juramentados, for six-shooters and revolvers are useless against them.\n\nMuslim Acehnese from the Aceh Sultanate performed suicide attacks known as \"Parang-sabil\" against Dutch invaders during the Aceh War. It was considered as part of personal jihad in the Islamic religion of the Acehnese. The Dutch called it \"Atjèh-moord\", (\"Acehmord\", \"Aceh mord\", \"Aceh-mord\") or (Aceh Pungo). The Acehnese work of literature, the \"Hikayat Perang Sabil\" provided the background and reasoning for the \"Aceh-mord\"- Acehnese suicide attacks upon the Dutch. The Indonesian translations of the Dutch terms are Aceh bodoh (Aceh pungo) or Aceh gila (Aceh mord).\n\n\"Atjèh-moord\" was also used against the Japanese by the Acehnese during the Japanese occupation of Aceh. The Acehnese Ulama (Islamic clerics) fought against both the Dutch and the Japanese, revolting against the Dutch in February 1942 and against Japan in November 1942. The revolt was led by the All-Aceh Religious Scholars' Association ( PUSA). The Japanese suffered 18 dead in the uprising while they slaughtered up to 100 or over 120 Acehnese. The revolt happened in Bayu and was centred around Tjot Plieng village's religious school. During the revolt, the Japanese troops armed with mortars and machine guns were charged by sword wielding Acehnese under Teungku Abduldjalil (Tengku Abdul Djalil) in Buloh Gampong Teungah and Tjot Plieng on 10 and 13 November. In May 1945 the Acehnese rebelled again.\n\nThe original Jawi script Acehnese language work Hikayat Perang Sabil (w:ace:Hikayat Prang Sabi, w:id:Hikayat Prang Sabi) has been transliterated into the Latin alphabet and annotated by Ibrahim Alfian (Teuku.) published in Jakarta. Perang sabi was the Acehnese word for jihad, a holy war and Acehnese language literary works on perang sabi were distributed by Islamic clerics ('ulama) such as Teungku di Tiro to help the resistance against the Dutch in the Aceh War. The recompense awarded by in paradise detailed in Islamic Arabic texts and Dutch atrocities were expounded on in the Hikayat Perang Sabil which was communally read by small cabals of Ulama and Acehnese who swore an oath before going to achieve the desired status of \"martyr\" by launching suicide attacks on the Dutch. Perang sabil was the Malay equivalent to other terms like Jihad, Ghazawat for \"Holy war\", the text was also spelled \"Hikayat perang sabi\". Fiction novels like Sayf Muhammad Isa's \"Sabil: Prahara di Bumi Rencong\" on the war by Aceh against the Dutch include references ro Hikayat Perang Sabil. Mualimbunsu Syam Muhammad wrote the work called \"Motives for Perang Sabil in Nusantara\", \"Motivasi perang sabil di Nusantara: kajian kitab Ramalan Joyoboyo, Dalailul-Khairat, dan Hikayat Perang Sabil\" on Indonesia's history of Islamic holy war (Jihad). Children and women were inspired to do suicide attacks by the Hikayat Perang Sabil against the Dutch. Hikayat Perang Sabil is also known as \"Hikayat Prang Sabi\". Hikayat Perang Sabil is considered as part of 19th century Malay literature. In Dutch occupied Aceh, Hikayat Perang Sabil was confiscated from Sabi's house during a Police raid on September 27, 1917.\n\n\n"}

This notion is fundamental in Knowledge building theory. If knowledge is not realized for a community then we do not have knowledge building. Examples of KBCs are\n\n\nKnowledge Building is a theory developed by Carl Bereiter and Marlene Scardamalia that deals with the construction of knowledge. To build knowledge, learners should collaborate with one another and establish common goals, hold group discussions, and synthesize ideas in such a way that their knowledge of a topic advances from their current understanding. Knowledge building is outwardly focused on generating contributions that learners can give back to the community. Thus, the product of knowledge building should be an “artifact”—such as a publication, an illustrated model, or a theory—which other learners can then use to advance their own understanding of that subject. Among the most widely cited models characterizing the processes of collaborative knowledge building are those of Garrison, Anderson & Archer (2001) ; Gunawardena, Lowe, & Anderson (1997); Harasim (2002); and Xin (2002).\n\nA school culture that fosters KBCs supports research, innovation, and high expectations for student achievement and participation. The twelve KB principles are continuously emphasized for and by teachers, students, and the school environment as a whole.\n12 Knowledge Building Principles (Adapted from Scardamalia, 2002)\n\nThe key focus for KBCs has been research on fostering KBCs in classrooms. Transforming a classroom into a KBC requires a significant shift in classroom norms and also in student and teacher identities. In this context, students define themselves through their personal learning goals and collaboratively pursue them. Students are viewed as intentional learners, working at the edge of each competence. Knowledge advances are not circumscribed by a teacher’s knowledge. \nSpecific to a KBC is the objectification of knowledge artifacts. More precisely, if in a regular class, questions, ideas and discussions are personal and ethereal constructs, in a KBC classroom, they are public artifacts that have a permanent presence in a digital format, usually in the classroom database. For this reason, they can be analyzed, pointed at, talked about, and progressively refined over time. In order to be successful, the members of the knowledge building community should accomplish the following: \nSuccessful knowledge building initiatives at an elementary school “demonstrated sustained advancement of knowledge building as a principle-based, school-wide innovation.” Rather than focusing on a particular procedure or pedagogical approach to KBC, this study emphasized using a principle-based approach. This approach “defines core values and principles, leaving teachers the challenge of engaging in reflective interpretation, using discretionary judgment, and making adaptive classroom decisions to accommodate their different contexts and possibilities.” The KBC model immerses students in collaborative efforts to extend knowledge of the classroom community rather than just individual learning. Students take ownership of their learning and knowledge building by completing the tasks of goal setting, long-term planning, and impromptu process control, rather than following predetermined scripts for learning set by the teacher. Understanding, integrating, and sharing information are all vital components of sustained KBC models.\nBecause learners at the post-secondary level are more cognitively mature than younger students, researchers have observed many successful implementations of KBCs in higher education. Stefano Cacciamani published a study in 2010 that explored how an instructor could make the shift from knowledge transition to knowledge construction. In the study, students enrolled in an online course initially modeled after a guided inquiry format, in which the teacher played a significant role in setting students' goals and monitoring their progress. This format eventually shifted to a self-organized inquiry model focused on knowledge construction, where students were expected to replace the teacher in setting class goals and monitoring their own progress. This fundamental change entailed the instructor’s concession of increasing responsibility to students. The study’s results indicate that students in the self-organized course engaged in critical thinking and displayed a greater effort to go beyond the given information than students in the guided inquiry course. To that effect, the authors concluded \"...there is a suggestion in the early pilot work reported, that the self-organized inquiry approach favours a shift towards a knowledge construction perspective more so than the guided inquiry approach.\" \nParticipants in a 2012 study by Philip used Knowledge Forum, an online environment designed to support knowledge building, to read, post, and respond to notes over the course of one semester. The author identified several likely indicators of the presence of a KBC, including:\n\nDespite some promising results, efforts to implement KBCs in classrooms have also seen unintended consequences. Disparities in participation and maladaptive strategies aimed at reducing individual workload can lessen the effectiveness of KBCs for the community as a whole. Student relationships have a significant effect on participation patterns, and individual feelings of autonomy, relatedness, and intrinsic motivation all influence behaviors in KBCs. Diversity among peers, response lags, and deadlines can be negative influences on collaboration causing stress, frustration, and difficulties in negotiating meaning and consensus. Without effective guidance from teachers, students tend to focus on individualistic contributions related to their areas of personal interest rather than developing a shared understanding or pursuing a common line of inquiry.\nThe collaborative technology itself could also be problematic. The tool of choice may be difficult to use and thus pose a slow learning curve for collaborators. In a review of fifty studies, Hew, Cheung, & Ng (2010) identified a series of \"design quirks\" common to these tools that frustrate students, such as the inaccessibility of other posts and features while in composition mode and the inability to edit and delete messages after posting. Unforeseen glitches in the technology can also add strain to the collaborative process.\n\nScardamalia, Bereiter, and their team at the Center for Applied Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto developed a networked software system called Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments, or CSILE, in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the system was re-engineered and released for commercial use as Knowledge Forum™. This software provides support for cognitive processes involved in knowledge building, making these visible to both the instructors and the students. Discussions, comments, knowledge artifacts, and knowledge advances are all visible and improvable within Knowledge Forum. The software also includes tools that can be used for formative (self-)assessment of the quantity of activity of students and the connections between them. Knowledge Forum has been used as a tool to support knowledge building communities in K-12 and higher-education settings. \nWith the rapid growth of social networking software, a wide range of Web 2.0 tools with the capability to support community knowledge building have become available. Blogs, micro-blogs, wikis, and virtual worlds are just some of the Web 2.0 tools that have been implemented in K-12, higher education, and corporate settings. Likewise, learning management systems commonly contain tools for discussion that have been used as the platform for KBCs, though the alignment of these tools with the requirements of community knowledge building has been questioned. Knowledge mapping software can increase the number of hypotheses generated in group problem solving as well as the likelihood that a group will converge on a consensus. Real-time collaborative editing platforms, like Google Docs, enable multiple people to work on a document simultaneously. These tools allow \"evolving documents\" to be refined repeatedly by multiple collaborators, and come equipped with built-in chat functionality, commenting, and reviewing tools for facilitating knowledge construction through suggestion-making.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58288", "title": "Louse", "text": "Louse\n\nLouse (plural: lice) is the common name for members of the order Phthiraptera, which contains nearly 5,000 species of wingless insect. Lice are obligate parasites, living externally on warm-blooded hosts which include every species of bird and mammal, except for monotremes, pangolins, and bats. Lice are vectors of diseases such as typhus.\n\nChewing lice live among the hairs or feathers of their host and feed on skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole life on a single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.\n\nHumans host three species of louse, the head louse, the body louse and the pubic louse. The body louse has the smallest genome of any known insect; it has been used as a model organism and has been the subject of much research.\n\nLice were ubiquitous in human society until at least the Middle Ages. They appear in folktales, songs such as \"The Kilkenny Louse House\", and novels such as James Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\". They commonly feature in the psychiatric disorder delusional parasitosis. A louse was one of the early subjects of microscopy, appearing in Robert Hooke's 1667 book, \"Micrographia\".\n\nHumans host three different kinds of lice: head lice, body lice, and pubic lice. Lice infestations can be controlled with lice combs, and medicated shampoos or washes.\n\nSucking lice are small wingless insects ranging from in length. They have narrow heads and oval, flattened bodies. They have no ocelli, and their compound eyes are reduced in size or absent. Their antennae are short with three to five segments, and their mouth parts, which are retractable into their head, are adapted for piercing and sucking. There is a cibarial pump at the start of the gut; it is powered by muscles attached to the inside of the cuticle of the head. The mouthparts consist of a proboscis which is toothed, and a set of stylets arranged in a cylinder inside the proboscis, containing a salivary canal (ventrally) and a food canal (dorsally). The thoracic segments are fused, the abdominal segments are separate, and there is a single large claw at the tip of each of the six legs.\n\nChewing lice are also flattened and can be slightly larger than sucking lice, ranging in length from . They are similar to sucking lice in form but the head is wider than the thorax and all species have compound eyes. There are no ocelli and the mouthparts are adapted for chewing. The antennae have three to five segments and are slender in the suborder Ischnocera, but club-shaped in the suborder Amblycera. The legs are short and robust, and terminated by one or two claws. Many lice are specific to a single species of host and have co-evolved with it. They are usually cryptically coloured to match the fur or feathers of the host.\n\nLice are divided into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their nourishment from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the scalp and pubic hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt to find a new host.\n\nA louse's color varies from pale beige to dark gray; however, if feeding on blood, it may become considerably darker. Female lice are usually more common than males, and some species are parthenogenetic, with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse's egg is commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts' hair with specialized saliva; the saliva/hair bond is very difficult to sever without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, may simply leave their eggs in parts of the body inaccessible to preening, such as the interior of feather shafts. Living louse eggs tend to be pale whitish, whereas dead louse eggs are yellower. Lice are exopterygotes, being born as miniature versions of the adult, known as nymphs. The young moult three times before reaching the final adult form, usually within a month after hatching.\n\nThe average number of lice per host tends to be higher in large-bodied bird species than in small ones. Lice have an aggregated distribution across bird individuals, i.e. most lice live on a few birds, while most birds are relatively free of lice. This pattern is more pronounced in territorial than in colonial—more social—bird species.\nHost organisms that dive under water to feed on aquatic prey harbor fewer taxa of lice.\nBird taxa that are capable of exerting stronger antiparasitic defense—such as stronger T cell immune response or larger uropygial glands—harbor more taxa of Amblyceran lice than others.\nReductions in the size of host populations may cause a long-lasting reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.\n\nLice may reduce host life expectancy if the infestation is heavy, but most seem to have little effect on their host. The habit of dust bathing in domestic hens is probably an attempt by the birds to rid themselves of lice. Lice may transmit microbial diseases and helminth parasites, but most individuals spend their whole life cycle on a single host and are only able to transfer to a new host opportunistically. Ischnoceran lice may reduce the thermoregulation effect of the plumage; thus heavily infested birds lose more heat than others.\nLice infestation is a disadvantage in the context of sexual rivalry.\n\nThe order Phthiraptera is clearly a monophyletic grouping, united as the members are by a number of derived features including their parasitism on warm-blooded vertebrates and the combination of their metathoracic ganglia with their abdominal ganglia to form a single ventral nerve junction. The order has traditionally been divided into two suborders, the sucking lice (Anoplura) and the chewing (Mallophaga); however, recent classifications suggest that the Mallophaga are paraphyletic and four suborders are now recognized:\n\n\nNearly 5,000 species of louse have been identified, about 4,000 being parasitic on birds and 800 on mammals. Lice are present on every continent in all the habitats that their host animals and birds occupy. They are found even in the Antarctic, where penguins carry 15 species of lice (in the genera \"Austrogonoides\" and \"Nesiotinus\").\n\nLice have been the subject of significant DNA research in the 2000s that led to discoveries on human evolution. The three species of sucking lice that parasitize human beings belong to two genera, \"Pediculus\" and \"Pthirus\": head lice (\"Pediculus humanus capitis\"), body lice (\"Pediculus humanus corporis\"), and pubic lice (\"Pthirus pubis\"). Human head and body lice (genus \"Pediculus\") share a common ancestor with chimpanzee lice, while pubic lice (genus \"Pthirus\") share a common ancestor with gorilla lice. Using phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analysis, Reed et al. hypothesized that \"Pediculus\" and \"Pthirus\" are sister taxa and monophyletic. In other words, the two genera descended from the same common ancestor. The age of divergence between \"Pediculus\" and its common ancestor is estimated to be 6-7 million years ago, which matches the age predicted by chimpanzee-hominid divergence. Because parasites rely on their hosts, host-parasite cospeciation events are likely.\n\nGenetic evidence suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus \"Pediculus\", the divergence in \"Pthirus\" does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a \"Pthirus\" species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While it is difficult to determine if a parasite-host switch occurred in evolutionary history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).\n\nAdditionally, the DNA differences between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and feed on the scalp, while body lice live on clothing and feed on the body. Because body lice require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides an estimate of the date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.\n\nThe mitochondrial genome of the human species of body lice (\"Pediculus humanus humanus\"), the head louse (\"Pediculus humanus capitis\") and the pubic louse (\"Pthirus pubis\") fragmented into a number of minichromosomes, at least seven million years ago. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA in human body and hair lice reveals that greater genetic diversity existed in African than in non-African lice. Human lice can also shed light on human migratory patterns in pre-history. The dominating theory of anthropologists regarding human migration is the Out of Africa Hypothesis. Genetic diversity accumulates over time, and mutations occur at a relatively constant rate. Because there is more genetic diversity in African lice, the lice and their human hosts must have existed in Africa before anywhere else.\n\nThe phylogeny of the Phthiraptera is shown, not yet fully resolved, in the cladogram:\n\nLice have been intimately associated with human society throughout history. In the Middle Ages, they were essentially ubiquitous. At the death of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury in 1270, it was recorded that \"The vermin boiled over like water in a simmering cauldron, and the onlookers burst into alternate weeping and laughing\". A mediaeval treatment for lice was an ointment made from pork grease, incense, lead, and aloe.\n\nRobert Hooke's 1667 book, \"Micrographia: or some physiological descriptions of minute bodies made by magnifying glasses with observations and Inquiries thereupon\", illustrated a human louse, drawn as seen down an early microscope.\n\nMargaret Cavendish's satirical \"The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World\" (1668) has \"Lice-men\" as \"mathematicians\", investigating nature by trying to weigh the air like the real scientist Robert Boyle.\n\nIn 1935 the Harvard medical researcher Hans Zinsser wrote the book \"Rats, Lice and History\", alleging that both body and head lice transmit typhus between humans. Despite this, the modern view is that only the body louse can transmit the disease.\n\nSoldiers in the trenches of the First World War suffered severely from lice, and the typhus they carried. The Germans boasted that they had lice under effective control, but themselves suffered badly from lice in the Second World War on the Eastern Front, especially in the Battle of Stalingrad. \"Delousing\" became a grim euphemism for the extermination of Jews in concentration camps such as Auschwitz under the Nazi regime.\n\nIn the psychiatric disorder delusional parasitosis, patients express a persistent irrational fear of animals such as lice and mites, imagining that they are continually infested and complaining of itching, with \"an unshakable false belief that live organisms are present in the skin\".\n\nThe human body louse \"Pediculus humanus humanus\" has (2010) the smallest insect genome known. This louse can transmit certain diseases while the human head louse (\"P. h. capitis\"), to which it is closely related, cannot. With their simple life history and small genomes, the pair make ideal model organisms to study the molecular mechanisms behind the transmission of pathogens and vector competence.\n\nJames Joyce's 1939 book \"Finnegans Wake\" has the character Shem the Penman infested with \"foxtrotting fleas, the lieabed lice, ... bats in his belfry\".\n\nClifford E. Trafzer's \"A Chemehuevi Song: The Resilience of a Southern Paiute Tribe\" retells the story of Sinawavi (Coyote)'s love for Poowavi (Louse). Her eggs are sealed in a basket woven by her mother, who gives it to Coyote, instructing him not to open it before he reaches home. Hearing voices coming from it, however, Coyote opens the basket and the people, the world's first human beings, pour out of it in all directions.\n\nThe Irish songwriter John Lyons (b. 1934) wrote the popular song \"The Kilkenny Louse House\". The song contains the lines \"Well we went up the stairs and we put out the light, Sure in less than five minutes, I had to show fight. For the fleas and the bugs they collected to march, And over me stomach they formed a great arch\". It has been recorded by Christie Purcell (1952), Mary Delaney on \"From Puck to Appleby\" (2003), and the Dubliners on \"Double Dubliners\" (1972) among others.\n\nRobert Burns dedicated a poem to the Louse, inspired by witnessing one on a lady's bonnet in church: \"Ye ugly, creepin, blastid wonner, Detested, shunn'd, by saint and sinner, How dare ye set your fit upon her, sae fine lady! Gae somewhere else, and seek your dinner on some poor body.\" John Milton in \"Paradise Lost\" mentioned the biblical plague of lice visited upon pharaoh: \"Frogs, lice, and flies must all his palace fill with loathed intrusion, and filled all the land.\" John Ray recorded a Scottish proverb, \"Gie a beggar a bed and he'll repay you with a Louse.\"\nIn Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\", Thersites compares Menelaus, brother of Agamemnon, to a louse: \"Ask me not what I would be, if I were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus.\"\n\n\n"}

Its main objective is to engage visitors in learning experiences to enhance their curiosity and interest on their objects and collections. \n\nIn a seminal report called \"Excellence and Equity\" published in 1992 by the American Association of Museums (now the American Alliance of Museums), the educational role of museums was identified as the core to museums' service to the public. According to the report, \"...the public dimensions of museums leads them to perform the public service of education—a term that in its broadest sense includes exploration, study, observation, critical thinking, contemplation and dialogue\". As museum education has developed as a field of study and interest in its own right, efforts have been made to record its history and to establish a research agenda to strengthen its position as a discipline in the wider work of museums.\n\nIn his first report as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Education and Culture during John F. Kennedy's administration, in 1968, Philip H. Coombs emphasized the increment of the educative needs of the world’s population after World War II. In it, he mentions the diversity of non-formal education activities that constitute, or should constitute an important complement to formal education to the total educational efforts of any country. To Coombs, non-formal education had the potential to satisfy the learning demands of both, individuals and collectivities, because unlike formal and traditional education, which is rigid with its contents and programs, it is flexible and, when planning and designing educational activities, it takes into consideration local variations of culture, economy and society, which counteracts the tendency of developing countries to just imitate education models of developed countries.\n\nIn a work written by Coombs in conjunction with M. Ahmed, non-formal education is defined as \"...any organized educational activity outside the established formal system—whether operating separately or as an important feature of some broader activity—that is intended to serve identifiable learning clienteles and learning objective\". Afterwards, Coombs and Ahmed add the idea that non-formal education is any systematic educative activity, organized outside from the official framework to facilitate educative experiences for all people, regardless of age, genre, nationality, social, economic or health situation. Throughout his career, Coombs encouraged and impulsed the professional development of people responsible of non-formal education, which will be determining to the development and professionalization of the educative areas in institutions devoted to non-formal education.\n\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, art museums were very new institutions to the average visitor, who was seen wandering with no clear direction through the galleries, and with no clear idea on how to appreciate and study the exhibitions. In 1906, architect J. Randolph Coolidge Jr. was appointed the temporary director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. He experimented with a guiding system in the galleries, to help visitors orient themselves throughout their walk across the exhibitions.\n\nAn article published in the June bulletin of the museum that same year, features one of the first uses of the term docent and the description of its functions:\"It has been proposed to the Trustees to consider the permanent appointment of one or more persons of intelligence and education who could act as intermediaries between Curators and the many who would be glad to avail themselves of trained instruction in our galleries. Through these docents, as it has been proposed to call them, the heads of departments could instruct many more persons than it would be possible for them to accompany through the galleries; and illustrated lectures upon the collections prepared in the departments might be regularly given by these specially qualified aids both in the Museum and in the class rooms of neighboring schools and colleges.\"\n\n\"Excellence in Practice: Museum Education Principles and Standards\" was developed by the Education Committee of the American Association of Museums to help guide and inform the practice of Museum Education.\n\"The Journal of Museum Education\" (JME) is a journal covering the theory, training and practice of the museum education field from the Museum Education Roundtable. Articles are written by museum, education, and research professionals. \"The Museum Education Monitor\" was a monthly email newsletter that tracked and recorded research and resources in museum education worldwide. Publication of \"the Museum Education Monitor\" ended in 2015.\n\"Art Museum Teaching\" is a digitally published resource and collaborative online forum for reflecting on issues of teaching, learning, and experimental practice in the field of art museum education. \n\"The Journal of Museum Studies\" is an independent, not-for-profit publication dedicated to creating and preserving a digital archive of scholarly articles in the field of museum studies.\n\n\n"}

July 29 is traditionally the date of the death of King Olaf at the Battle of Stiklestad, east of Nidaros (Trondheim), Norway, in 1030. King Olaf's martyrdom at Stiklestad appears to have contributed decisively to establishing Christianity throughout the nation of Norway. King Olaf was subsequently canonized in Nidaros on 3 August 1031 following efforts principally of Bishop Grimkell.\n\nUntil the Lutheran Reformation in the 16th century, Olsok was a major church feast in the Nordic countries. The late 19th and the early 20th century saw a renewed interest in Olsok, particularly in Norway. The Roman Catholic Church in Norway recognizes Olsok as a major feast all over the country, while the Lutheran Church of Norway recognizes the day principally in Nidaros Cathedral as well as other churches. Starting with the 900th anniversary of Stiklestad in 1930, July 29 has been an official flag day (\"Olsokdagen\") in Norway. Since 1954, \"The Saint Olav Drama\" has been performed at Stiklestad each year.\n\nIn the Faroe Islands, Ólavsøka is also recognized on July 29. Ólavsøka is the biggest summer festival in the Faroe Islands and is commonly celebrated over a several day period. This tradition dates from when the islands were part of Norway during the Middle Ages. Within Sweden \"Olofsmässa\" (\"Olaf's Mass\") is recognized principally within the former Norwegian province of Härjedalen.\n\nWithin Finland, \"Pyhän Olavin Päivä\" (\"St. Olaf's Day\") is celebrated principally at Savonlinna, site of Olavinlinna (\"Olof's Castle\"), since St. Olaf is the patron saint of the site.\n\n\n\n"}

The president of the Queen's English Society is Bernard Lamb, a former reader in genetics at Imperial College.\n\nIn June 2012 the Society announced its closure because of declining participation, but it continued to exist, as volunteers filled the committee in September 2012.\n\nThe Queen's English Society was founded in 1972 by Joe Clifton, an Oxford graduate and schoolteacher. The Society's meetings were held in Arundel, and members wrote to newspapers and broadcasters, pointing out perceived linguistic errors and instances of ambiguous spoken English.\n\nThe Society claims to be concerned about the education of children. It believes that teachers should be trained to spot certain errors in English usage. In 1988, the Society delivered a petition to the then Secretary of State for Education and Science, Kenneth Baker, urging him \"to introduce the compulsory study of formal grammar, including parsing and sentence analysis, into the school curriculum\".\n\nThe objectives of the Society, as expressed in its constitution, are \"to promote the maintenance, knowledge, understanding, development and appreciation of the English language as used both colloquially and in literature; to educate the public in its correct and elegant usage; and to discourage the intrusion of anything detrimental to clarity or euphony”.\n\nOn 4 June 2012, after a general meeting of the society attracted no nominations to replace retiring officers of the Society, chairman Rhea Williams announced that the society would cease to exist, but after new committee members volunteered, the Society was able to continue.\n\nIn June 2010 the QES announced that it had formed an Academy of English, a language reference website. The founder of the academy was quoted as saying that: \"At the moment, anything goes. Let’s set down a clear standard of what is good, correct, proper English. Let’s have a body to sit in judgment.\"\n\nThe Academy attracted widespread press coverage, some positive and some negative, and the QES enjoyed a surge in membership. In September 2010 the QES deleted the \"Academy\" content from its website, though the Academy was continued by its own board on a separate website, which is linked to that of the QES and \"vice versa\".\n\nA \"Daily Telegraph\" opinion piece had called the QES Academy \"both welcome and long overdue.

In the \"Baltimore Sun\" John E McIntyre wrote: \"the peevish combination of shibboleth and superstition about language, combined with a sad, sad little snobbery about their presumed mastery of the language, renders these people [the QES] impervious to reason\", referencing an analysis of their nascent website by Stan Carey. Comedian David Mitchell disliked the \"self-appointed\" nature of the Academy and asked, \"[b]y what authority would they sit in judgment?\" The proposal was received with scepticism by \"The Economist\"'s Lane Greene.\n\nThe Society’s quarterly journal, \"Quest\", has been sent to members from 1979. It included articles, letters from members, news, book reviews, puzzles and poems.

It is used by Quebec universities for selection purposes.\n\nThe R score is in fact a \"z\"-score (Zcol) multiplied by a group dispersion indicator (IDGZ) to which an indicator of group strength (ISGZ) has been added.\n\nThe Zcol is the number of standard deviations the student is above the class average and gives an indication of the grade of the student with respect to the grades of other students in the class. The ISGZ is the average high school z-score (Zsec) the group's students obtained on the MEES uniform examination subjects in Secondary 4 and 5. The IDGZ is the standard deviation of the students' Zsec scores. The inclusion of the ISGZ and IDGZ in the determination of the R score allows for a more equitable comparison between students, regardless of their CEGEP's academic rank, although the effectiveness remains in dispute.\n\nThe use of the constant C = 5 greatly reduces the possibility of a negative value in the score and the multiplying the sum of all the preceding values by the constant D = 5 ensures the largeness of the score. The R score is defined such that the average is 25. Most R scores fall between 15 and 35, although any real number is a possible R score since the z-scores tend to positive or negative infinity as the standard deviation decreases. To guarantee that a grade of 100 will produce an R score of at least 35, an adjusted Z score formula guaranteed to produce a result above 35 is used. Grades below 50 are not considered when calculating the average and standard deviation of a grade distribution.\n\nAn R score is calculated for every course except for Physical Education taken before Fall 2007 or for remedial courses. The final R score is the weighted average of the R score in all courses. In addition, failed courses are given a reduced weight in the overall R score; they are weighted at 25% of the credits in the first semester and subsequently at 50%. \n\nFailed courses have been given a reduced weight since October 2004. Before the Fall 2007 semester, Physical Education courses were not given an R score. Before July 2017, the R score did not include the IDGZ and used calculated the ISG as \n\nAlso until July 2017, an additional score of 0.5 was added to the overall R score to a student graduating with an International Baccalaureate degree or a \"DEC (Diplôme d'études collégiales) en Sciences, Lettres et Arts\". The adjustment of Z score using the IDGZ makes this unnecessary. \n\nFirsthand experience suggests that the R score is not as ideal a tool as it was meant to be. A recurring complaint from students is that the ISG does not seem to sufficiently offset the advantage enjoyed by students in weak groups. Such students have the opportunity to obtain grades much higher than the low average of their class, thus earning an elevated Z score, whereas students in strong groups cannot earn such high Z scores. One possible reason for this is that the ISG for a certain course is based on the average of the grades in all high school courses, which may not correlate to the group's strength in that course as much as the average of the grades of similar courses in high school. \n\nSuch perceived weaknesses of the R score are particularly worrying, because it is the main and sometimes only criterion considered by Quebec universities during the admissions process. Since the R score is perceived as an absolute measure of a student's academic performance regardless of their College academic rank, differences smaller than 0.5 are often used to discriminate between candidates applying to programs with fixed quotas, such as medicine, pharmacy, dentistry or law.\n\n"}

It is Child Ballad 1 and Roud 161, and exists in several variants. The first known tune was attached to it in 1719.\n\nIn the earliest surviving version of the song, \"Inter diabolus et virgo\", \"between the devil and the maiden\" (mid-15th century), the \"foul fiend\" proposes to abduct a maiden unless she can answer a series of riddles. The woman prays to Jesus for wisdom, and answers the riddles correctly. \n\nIn later versions, a knight puts a woman to test before he marries her (sometimes after seducing her), or a devil disguised as a knight tries to carry her off. The woman knows the answers, and thus either wins the marriage or is free of the devil. In the latter case, the last riddle is often \"what is worse than woman?\" (the devil).\n\nThe riddles vary, but typical ones include\n\nThe motif of riddling in folklore is very ancient, the stories of Oedipus and Samson giving two early examples. The particular form used here matches the folktale Aarne-Thompson type 875 \"The Clever Girl\" where a woman wins a husband by her clever answers to riddles. Other tales of this type include \"What Is the Fastest Thing in the World?\" and \"The Wise Little Girl\". \n\nIn this ballad, the words of each verse are interspersed with a chorus phrase \"lay the bent to the bonny broom\". A. L. Lloyd euphemistically describes this as a phrase of \"physiological significance\", explaining that the word \"bent\" means a horn. \"Broom\" most likely refers to the flowering shrub.\n\nThere are many German variants of this ballad, and a Gaelic form was widespread among both Scots and Irish.\n\n\n\n"}

These groups worked similarly to tawaifs.\n\nRussian painter Grigory Gagarin who lived in the Caucasus in 1840–1855 depicted the Shamakhi dancers in a series of paintings, in which he referred to them as \"bayaderki\" (баядерки; sg. \"bayaderka\" – баядерка; originally the Portuguese term \"balliadera\" borrowed into Russian and other European languages via French (\"bayadère\") and initially used to refer to the devadasi.)\n\nThe extant documents regarding the Shamakhi dancers, and dances, are very limited. In literature, Shamakhi dancers are referred to in Comte de Gobineau's novel \"The dancing girl of Shamakha and other Asiatic tales\".\n\n\"The Dancer of Shamakha\" recounts the life of Armenian dancer Armen Ohanian, her education as a dancer, her childhood in Russia, and her travels in Iran and Egypt. It was published in French as \"La Danseuse de Shamakha\" in 1918 and translated into English in 1923 by Rose Wilder. After moving to Europe, Ohanian danced traditional dances for audiences, gave lectures on poetry, and was an active member in intellectual and political circles. She eventually moved to Mexico.

Social relations derived from individual agency form the basis of social structure and the basic object for analysis by social scientists. Fundamental inquiries into the nature of social relations feature in the work of sociologists such as Max Weber in his theory of social action.\n\nCategorizing social interactions enables observational and other social research, such as Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft (lit. \"community and society\"), collective consciousness, etc. However different schools and theories of sociology and other social sciences dispute the methods used for such investigations.\n\nAccording to Piotr Sztompka, forms of relation and interaction in sociology and anthropology may be described as follows: first and most basic are animal-like behaviors, i.e. various physical movements of the body. Then there are actions – movements with a meaning and purpose. Then there are social behaviors, or social actions, which address (directly or indirectly) other people, which solicit a response from another agent. Next are social contacts, a pair of social actions, which form the beginning of social interactions. Social interactions in turn form the basis of social relations. Symbols define social relationships. Without symbols, our social life would be no more sophisticated than that of animals. For example, without symbols we would have no aunts or uncles, employers or teachers-or even brothers and sisters. In sum, symbolic integrations analyze how social life depends on the ways we define ourselves and others. They study face-to-face interaction, examining how people make sense out of life, how they determine their relationships.\n\nThis sociological hierarchy is illustrated in the table below:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40973063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40973063", "title": "The Exorcist", "text": "The Exorcist\n\nThe Exorcist is an American media franchise that originated with William Peter Blatty's 1971 horror novel of the same name and most prominently featured in a 1973 film adapted from the novel, and many subsequent prequels and sequels. All of these installments focus on fictional accounts of people possessed by Pazuzu, the main antagonist of the series, and the efforts of religious authorities to counter this possession.\n\nThe Exorcist is a 1971 novel by American writer William Peter Blatty. The book details the demonic possession of twelve-year-old Regan MacNeil, the daughter of a famous actress, and the two priests who attempt to exorcise the demon. It was published by Harper & Row. \n\nThe novel was inspired by a 1949 case of demonic possession and exorcism that Blatty heard about while he was a student in the class of 1950 at Georgetown University. As a result, the novel takes place in Washington D.C. near the campus of Georgetown University. In September 2011, the novel was reprinted by Harper Collins to celebrate its fortieth anniversary, with slight revisions made by Blatty as well as interior title artwork by Jeremy Caniglia.\n\n\"Legion\" is the 1983 follow-up to the \"Exorcist\" novel. It was made into the movie \"The Exorcist III\" in 1990. Like \"The Exorcist\", it involves demonic possession. The book was the focus of a court case over its exclusion from \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list.\n\nBlatty based aspects of the Gemini Killer on the real-life Zodiac Killer, who, in a January 1974 letter to the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", had praised the original \"Exorcist\" film as \"the best satirical comedy that I have ever seen\".\n\nThe Exorcist is a 1973 American supernatural horror film directed by William Friedkin, adapted by William Peter Blatty from his 1971 novel of the same name, and starring Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Max von Sydow, and Jason Miller. The film is part of \"The Exorcist\" franchise.The book, inspired by the 1949 exorcism of Roland Doe, deals with the demonic possession of a 12-year-old girl and her mother's attempts to win back her child through an exorcism conducted by two priests. The adaptation is relatively faithful to the book, which itself has been commercially successful (hitting the \"New York Times\" bestseller list).\n\nJohn Boorman's \"\" was released in 1977, and revisited Regan four years after her initial ordeal. The plot dealt with an investigation into the legitimacy of Merrin's exorcism of Regan in the first film. In flashback sequences, we see Regan giving Merrin his fatal heart attack, as well as scenes from the exorcism of a young boy named Kokumo in Africa many years earlier.\n\n\"The Exorcist III\" appeared in 1990, written and directed by Blatty himself from his own 1983 novel \"Legion\". Jumping past the events of \"Exorcist II\", this book and film presented a continuation of Karras' story. Following the precedent set in \"The Ninth Configuration,\" Blatty turned a supporting character from the first film—in this case, Kinderman—into the chief protagonist. Though the characters of Karras and Kinderman were acquainted during the murder investigation in \"The Exorcist\" and Kinderman expressed fondness for Karras, in \"Exorcist III\" Blatty has Kinderman remembering Karras as his \"best friend\". Jason Miller reprised his Academy Award-nominated role in \"The Exorcist\" for this film.\n\nBecause of the studio's dissatisfaction with Schrader's version of the prequel (see \"Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist\"), Renny Harlin was then hired as director to retool the movie. Harlin reused some of Schrader's footage but shot mostly new material to create a more conventional horror film. Harlin's new version \"\" was released, but was not well received.\n\nA prequel film attracted attention and controversy even before its release in 2004; it went through a number of directorial and script changes, such that two versions were ultimately released. John Frankenheimer was originally hired as director for the project, but withdrew before filming started due to health concerns. He died a month later. Paul Schrader replaced him. Upon completion the studio rejected Schrader's version as being too slow, and hired another director to retool the movie. Nine months after the release of the retooled movie (see \"Exorcist: The Beginning\") Schrader's original version, retitled \"\", was given a small theatrical release. \n\nBlatty directed \"The Ninth Configuration\", a post-Vietnam War drama set in a mental institution. Released in 1980, it was based on Blatty's novel of the same name. Though it contrasts sharply with the tone of \"The Exorcist,\" Blatty regards \"Configuration\" as its true sequel. The lead character is the astronaut from Chris' party, Lt. Cutshaw.\n\nA made-for-television film, \"Possessed\" (based on the book of the same name by Thomas B. Allen), was broadcast on Showtime on October 22, 2000, directed by Steven E. de Souza and written by de Souza and Michael Lazarou. The film claimed to follow the true accounts that inspired Blatty to write \"The Exorcist\" and starred Timothy Dalton, Henry Czerny, and Christopher Plummer.\n\nOn January 22, 2016, 20th Century Fox Television announced they were developing a television series of \"The Exorcist\". On February 2, 2016, Rupert Wyatt was hired to direct the pilot episode. On March 2, 2016, Alfonso Herrera and Ben Daniels were cast as Father Tomas Ortega and Father Marcus Lang. Geena Davis was cast as Angela Rance in the pilot.\n\nThe pilot filmed in Chicago in early 2016, and on May 10 the series was greenlit for a first season.\n\nIn February 2008, American playwright John Pielmeier expressed an interest in adapting William Peter Blatty's novel of the same name into a play and soon met with Blatty. He then began working on a script for the play, in which the first draft was completed in ten days. \"The Exorcist\" first premiered at the Geffen Playhouse, Los Angeles in 2012.\nA horror VR video game, called 'The Exorcist: Legion VR', was published on Steam, Oculus and PlayStation in 2018 and was based on the events of The Exorcist III. \n\nIn November 2009, it was announced that Blatty planned to direct a mini-series of \"The Exorcist\".\n\nIn September 2015, Morgan Creek Productions announced it was selling its library of films, while retaining remake and sequel rights to key properties, including \"The Exorcist\". Rumors began circulating that the original film would be remade, which was denied by Morgan Creek.\n\nThe success of \"The Exorcist\" inspired a string of possession-related films worldwide. The first was \"Beyond the Door\", a 1974 Italian film with Juliet Mills as a woman possessed by the devil. It appeared in the U.S. one year later. Also in 1974, a Turkish film, \"Şeytan\" (Turkish for \"Satan\"; the original film was also shown with the same name), is an almost scene-for-scene remake of the original. The same year in Germany, the exorcism-themed film \"Magdalena, vom Teufel besessen\" was released. In 1975, Britain released \"The Devil Within Her\" (also called \"I Don't Want to Be Born\") with Joan Collins as an exotic dancer who gives birth to a demon-possessed child.\n\nIn 1987, Warner Brothers released an animated short starring Daffy Duck, entitled \"Duxorcist\" which was a parody of \"Exorcist\", where a group of spirits possess a female duck, and Daffy does succeed in getting them out of the female figure. Similarly, a blaxploitation film was released in 1974 titled \"Abby\". While the films \"Şeytan\" and \"Magdalena, vom Teufel besessen\" were protected from prosecution by the laws of their countries of origin, \"Abby\"s producers (filming in Louisiana) were sued by Warner. The film was pulled from theaters, but not before making $4 million at the box office.\n\nA parody, \"Repossessed\", was released the same year as \"The Exorcist III\", with Blair lampooning the role she had played in the original. Another parody, was made in Italy by actor and comedian Ciccio Ingrassia in 1977, called L'esorciccio. The prologue for \"Scary Movie 2\" was a short parody of several scenes from the original.\n\nMexican comics \"Los Polivoces\", (The Multivoices), made a copy-parody, called \"El Exorcista\". Eduardo Manzano incarned the \"possession\", hard make-up was used. Flying clothes were used as \"phantoms\" and rotoscophy techniques make his bed fly.\n\nA 1995 episode of \"The Simpsons\" (titled \"Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily\") features Bart, Lisa and Maggie getting put under the care of the Flanders family. After Lisa reveals that neither she, Bart nor Maggie is baptized, Ned decides to baptize them. On the way to the baptism, Maggie turns her head around like Linda Blair in \"The Exorcist\". It was also parodied in Treehouse of Horror I, Treehouse of Horror XVI and Treehouse of Horror XXVIII. It was also parodied in \"Fland Canyon\".\n\nA meta-reference to the film was made in an episode of \"Supernatural\" titled \"The Usual Suspects\". On the show, demons possessing humans is a common plot element; demons in the series are human souls corrupted by their time in Hell, lacking physical bodies of their own to interact with Earth. Linda Blair appeared in \"The Usual Suspects\" as a police detective, with protagonist Dean Winchester finding her character familiar and expressing a strange desire for pea soup at the episode's conclusion.\n\nIn \"Angel: Earthly Possessions\", a spin-off comic story based on the TV series \"Angel\", protagonist Angel finds himself dealing with a priest who performs exorcisms, but comes to realize that the priest is summoning the demons for him to exorcise in the first place. He also makes a note of \"The Exorcist\" film, noting that the vision it created of possession actually made things easier for possession demons by making it harder for humans to know what to expect from a possession.\n\nIn the animated Horror-comedy show \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\", the episode \"The Demon In The Mattress\" is a direct spoof of the film, using several plot elements that was lifted straight from \"The Exorcist\". In the episode, Muriel orders a comfy new mattress, not paying attention to the grotesque deliveryman nor the sinister Horse-drawn carriage that delivered it. Unaware of the demon in the mattress, she is later possessed by it when while she sleeps.\n\nIn the paranormal TV show \"Ghost Adventures\" visited the Exorcist House for their 100th episode of the series. In the episode, Zak, Nick, and Aaron visit the house to see that an exorcism occurred there in 1949. The episode has been announced as one of the scariest lockdown since Bobby Mackeys.\n\nThe film was parodied in \"The Boondocks\" episode \"Stinkmeaner Strikes Back\" (season 2, episode 4).\n\nThe 2013 disaster comedy film \"This Is the End\" referenced the exorcism when Jonah Hill is possessed by a demon and Jay Baruchel performs an exorcism on by repeating lines from the movie.\n\nIn 2014, British author Saurav Dutt released a book entitled \"Pazuzu Unbound\", which is a book set in contemporary times dealing with the demon Pazuzu but which does not deal with the original characters in the film and novel on which the book is inspired.\n\n\n"}

It tells the parallel stories of a human and a plasma-based intelligence who manage to survive to the time near the heat death of the universe. The book is thus a combined work in speculative cosmology and space colonization.\n\n\"World at the End of Time\" follows the story of a young Earth-born human, Viktor Sorricaine, on a colony expedition to a distant star system. The colonists are frozen for the long trip between stars. Unknown to both the humans of Earth and the colonists, the stars around them are home to immensely long-lived (effectively immortal) plasma creatures—with no knowledge of, or interest in, the activities of insignificant matter creatures.\n\nWan-To, one of the oldest and most powerful plasma creatures, is engaged in a war. After creating modified copies of himself, or \"children\", for company, Wan-To finds himself in a deadly game of chess with them. The \"board\" is the entire galaxy and the weapons are the stars themselves. Each star may be home to an enemy \"child\"; using a variety of exotic particles, Wan-To is able to cause a targeted star to flare and kill any enemy that may be living within it.\n\nInto the middle of this battlefield, the three colony ships (\"Ark\", \"New Mayflower\" and \"Argosy\") unwittingly head for their new home. Upon arriving, the colony begins to establish itself ... only to discover that their entire local group of stars appears to be undergoing a bizarre acceleration, and are dimming. After a disastrous disease outbreak and terraforming failures, the desperate colonists eventually decide to investigate the strange radiation emissions from a small world within their solar system.\n\nUpon arriving in orbit, their ship is badly damaged and Viktor is forced into the onboard freezer systems. They are eventually rescued and unfrozen four hundred of the colony's years later, to find the colony in an even more desperate situation. The star around which the colony's world orbits has dimmed considerably (due to the energy being siphoned off to accelerate it) and they are now travelling so fast that, due to relativistic effects, the universe around them has shrunk to a bright dot. The colony has become factionalized and heavily religious, with scientific investigation discouraged.\n\nViktor is eventually frozen again for attempting to investigate why they have been accelerating. He wakes four thousand of the colony's years later, to find the far descendants of the colony have rebuilt their society into habitats closely orbiting the dim star (a brown dwarf) and created a high-technology civilization dedicated to pleasure and comfort. He makes his way, eventually, to the former colony to find only a few fellow-colonists unfrozen and attempting to rebuild it. His unique status as someone who was born on \"old Earth\" brings publicity to their efforts and the rebuilding forges ahead.\n\nDuring the four thousand years of Viktor's frozen sleep, the star system has been slowed again. After the vast amount of time that has passed, all that remains of the once young universe are dead stars and black holes, with Wan-To desperately surviving on the energy provided by proton decay. Wan-To receives a tachyon transmission from his long-forgotten systems and makes preparations to move into these last remaining stars — believing that the small matter creatures inhabiting the system are irrelevant and can be destroyed should they become an irritation.\n"}

It was announced during Ubisoft's E3 2013 press conference, and was released worldwide on 8 March 2016. It is set in a near future New York City in the aftermath of a smallpox pandemic; the player, who is a Special Agent of the eponymous Strategic Homeland Division, commonly referred to simply as \"Division\", is tasked with helping the group rebuild its operations in Manhattan, investigate the nature of the outbreak, and combating criminal activity in its wake. \"The Division\" is structured with elements of role-playing games, as well as cooperative and player versus player online multiplayer.\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews, and was a commercial success, with Ubisoft stating that the game broke the company's record for highest number of first-day sales. Furthermore, one week after the game's release, Ubisoft stated that \"The Division\" was the company's best-selling game, and the industry's biggest first-week launch for a new game franchise, which generated an estimated amount of $330 million globally. A sequel, \"Tom Clancy's The Division 2\", is scheduled to be released in March 2019.\n\n\"Tom Clancy's The Division\" is an action role-playing game set in an open world mid-crisis Manhattan with destructible environments that can be freely explored by the players. The player's mission is to restore order by investigating the source of a virus. The player character can carry three weapons, and explosives like sticky bombs and seeker mines to fight against enemies. Players may take cover behind objects during fire-fights to avoid taking damage from enemies, and to give them a tactical advantage when attacking. The game is played from a third-person perspective, meaning the character model is visible.\n\nAs players progress, they earn experience points (commonly known as XP) and currency. They can use this currency to buy weapons and gear, and use the points to learn new talents and skills. The player's gear is categorized into seven levels: worn, standard, specialized, superior, high-end, gear set items or the rarer exotic items, each with a specific color code. Gear can be either bought, or found as in-game loot, or crafted from gathered materials. The storyline missions involve objectives that are relevant to their respective wing of the Base of Operations, which serves as the player's home base. At the player's home base there are three wings which are the Medical, Security and Tech wing. Playing missions for a wing grants the player points for that wing which the player can spend to gain access to new talents, perks and facilities in the Base of Operations. The player will receive intel videos from each head of the wing at certain progression points, which the player can watch. The intel received is specific to its wing, with the Medical wing giving virus reports on the outbreak, the Security wing giving insight into each in-game enemy faction and the tech wing providing camera footage. The game features a dynamic, time-based weather system which may bring benefits or disadvantages to players. For instance, storms can hinder player's visibility and make aiming difficult. The game also features a day-night cycle which can change the behaviour of enemies in the game.\n\nThe Dark Zone is the player-versus-player competitive multiplayer mode featured in \"The Division\", where a lot of high-end weapons are left behind when the military retreats in the game. It is separated from the main campaign and has its own progression system. Higher quality items can be found within the Dark Zone, but are considered \"contaminated\"; contaminated loot can be stolen by other players, and must be flown out via helicopter in order for them to be available to the player after they leave the Dark Zone. Players can be accompanied by several co-operative partners and other neutral, player-controlled agents. These people, however, can turn against the player at any moment, going rogue. Players' level and ranking may drop if they die too often in the zone.\n\nOn Black Friday 2015, a smallpox pandemic, transmitted by a virus planted on banknotes, sweeps through New York City. The disease, known as \"Green Poison\" or \"The Dollar Flu\", causes widespread chaos, and Manhattan is placed under quarantine. The U.S. Government activates sleeper agents in the population who operate for the Strategic Homeland Division, or simply \"The Division\", to assist emergency responders, now called the Joint Task Force (JTF), in restoring order. In Brooklyn, the protagonist, a Division agent, assists the JTF before planning to depart for the Quarantine zone with fellow agent Faye Lau. However, the VTOL meant to take them there is destroyed in an explosion, killing the Division Commander along with most of the second wave and severely wounding Faye Lau. Arriving in a JTF-commandeered news helicopter instead, the Division agents reclaim the James A. Farley Post Office Building as their base of operations. From there, the agents undertake assignments to rescue important personnel, help in restoring the base of operations to full working capacity and combat criminal groups, such as the Rioters, common street thugs in New York who generally want to take advantage of the quarantine, the Rikers, escapees from Rikers Island, and the Cleaners, insane New York Sanitation workers who wield flamethrowers and believe everyone is infected. In the course of the game, the agent helps rescue important personnel like Dr. Jessica Kandel, Captain Roy Benitez and Paul Rhodes. These personnel head the Medical, Security and Tech wings of the base of operations respectively. Agents also recover a sample of Green Poison. Studying the sample reveals the virus was manufactured and then modified heavily by a controversial biologist named Dr. Gordon Amherst.\n\nEventually, the agents find footage of Division agent Aaron Keener going rogue and killing other agents, having gone insane after witnessing the chaos and destruction caused during the breakdown of order following the initial outbreak. It is also discovered Keener and the rest of the first wave of agents who went rogue along with him are assisting the \"Last Man Battalion\" (LMB), an equally rogue private military company that was abandoned by the government during the evacuation, and are now hostile to it. Working together, these two groups destroyed the VTOL and killed the Commander to weaken Division operations in New York. Intercepting a signal from the Russian consulate, the agents attempt to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a Russian virologist who claims to have information on the Green Poison. However, he is kidnapped by Keener and the LMB before the Division can reach him. After helping the JTF secure supplies and weapons, the JTF and Division agents launch an attack on the LMB's base, the evacuated United Nations headquarters. The agent finds footage of Keener and his fellow rogue agents abandoning the LMB, with Tchernenko as their prisoner. The leader of the LMB, Charles Bliss, initially escapes in a helicopter, but then returns to make a final stand alongside his men. In the end, the agent destroys the vehicle, killing Bliss. Lau informs the agent that most threats are destroyed or weakened, however the LMB was split into factions. New York is approaching stability, but an unknown signal leads the agent to a secluded laboratory. There, they find Dr. Amherst's remains, having discovered that he has died from exposure to his own virus. They also find a message from Keener, showing he has the technology to manufacture a new strain of Green Poison and intends to do so, and mysteriously tells the agent to explore the center of Manhattan, called the “Dark Zone.” The agent is informed that the information in the lab will further the development of a vaccine and is shown a recovered message from Amherst. In the message, Amherst reveals he engineered Green Poison as part of his eco-terrorist plan to decimate the human race and preserve the planet. If the player follows Keener's instructions, they will discover a message from Keener claiming that he plans to continue with Amherst's plot, as he has come to worship the virus as the judge of all humanity and plans to reverse engineer and improve it; he then offers the player a position beside him based on their actions in the Dark Zone.\n\n\"Tom Clancy's The Division\" was originally being developed as an eighth generation consoles exclusive. Shortly after the game's unveiling, Ubisoft stated that other platforms were not ruled out. Ubisoft asked PC gamers to show interest in the game by signing petitions, and then they would decide. The new intellectual property and tech has been in development for several years although development on the actual game began in early 2013.\n\nDuring E3 2013, the game was officially announced, with a trailer explaining the results of Operation Dark Winter and the purpose of Directive 51. During the Expo, Ubisoft announced a companion app that allows players to play the game on tablets. Players are able to join in the game as a drone to offer tactical support for players playing on PC and consoles. On 20 August 2013, Ubisoft announced that the game would be released for PC on Microsoft Windows as a result of the \"vocal and passionate PC community.\" On 7 February 2014, Ubisoft announced that Ubisoft Reflections was co-developing the game and was responsible for developing the map-design, character-design and the online components of the game. Red Storm Entertainment, a subsidiary of Ubisoft that was co-founded by Tom Clancy, was also working on the weapon-design of the game. Ubisoft Annecy was also announced to be one of the co-developers of the game on 8 May 2015.\n\nOn 15 May 2014, it was announced that \"The Division\" would be delayed until 2015, according to an anonymous source inside Massive Entertainment studio. \"The Division\" uses Ubisoft's new proprietary engine known as Snowdrop, which is made for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. On 9 June 2014, \"The Division\" was showcased at E3 2014 with an anticipated release for late 2015. In February 2016, Ubisoft announced that downloadable content for \"The Division\" would be timed exclusives for Xbox One.\n\nDuring E3 2015, the game's final release date and a player versus player area known as the Dark Zone were revealed. Its companion app was cancelled, as the company considered that the addition of drones will bring unfairness to the competitive multiplayer mode of the game. Unlike the previous E3 demo, Long Island, and Staten Island do not appear in the game at launch, while Brooklyn only appears in the opening hours of the game as the tutorial area. The beta was set to be released for the Xbox One in December 2015 and for Windows and PlayStation 4 in 2016. On 7 December 2015, Ubisoft announced that \"The Division\"s beta would be moved to \"early 2016\" and that an Xbox One exclusive alpha would begin on 9 December 2015.\n\nOn 26 January 2016, it was confirmed that the closed Beta would begin on 28 January 2016 for Xbox One and 29 January 2016 for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows, and end, for all platforms, on 1 February 2016. On 31 January 2016, Ubisoft announced that they had extended the beta, and that it would end on 2 February 2016.\n\nOn 9 February 2016, Ubisoft announced that \"The Division\"s open beta would begin for Xbox One on 18 February 2016, and for PC and PlayStation 4 on 19 February 2016, and would end for all platforms on 22 February 2016. Over 6.4 million players, across all platforms, participated in the open beta. On 27 February 2016, Ubisoft confirmed that there would be no microtransactions at launch. \"The Division\" was released on 8 March 2016, two years after its initially planned release.\n\nThere was a promotional short film released on Amazon prime titled \"The Division: Agent Origins\"\n\nThe game is supported by additional content, such as daily and weekly missions, Dark Zone missions and free updates, after the game's launch. The April update, \"Incursions\" introduces new gadgets, a new area called Falcon Lost and updated AI to the game. The May update, named \"Conflict\", adds Dark Zone Extraction Hijacking and the new Incursion - Clear Sky, which was released. The game was announced to be supported by 3 paid expansions. In June, \"Underground\", which includes missions set in tunnels and subways, was released. It was reported that it would be followed by \"Survival\", which adds the Survival game mode. \"Last Stand\" was set to be released in the last quarter of the year. \n\n\"Survival\" and \"Last Stand\" were delayed to late 2016 and early 2017 respectively, so that Ubisoft can focus its effort into fixing the core game's issues, such as balancing and bugs. \"Survival\" was available on all platforms by December. \"Last Stand\" was released on 28 February 2017.\n\nUbisoft in March 2017 revealed plans for a second year of additional content with two free expansions. Update 1.7 was released on 15 August including additional features and tweaks. The update added \"Global Events\", limited-time events with gameplay modifiers that give special rewards. In addition, it also adds the ability to customize a character's face, cosmetic items as well as \"Commendations\" which replaces \"Feats\". \n\nUpdate 1.8 was released on 5 December 2017. It adds a new area called West Side Pier as well as two new games modes called Resistance and Skirmish. In Resistance,\nthe player has to fend off waves of enemies. Skirmish is a multiplayer mode where teams of four players have to achieve the highest kill-count.\n\n\"Tom Clancy's The Division\" received \"generally favourable\" reviews according to review aggregator, Metacritic. \"Ars Technica\" drew comparisons between \"The Division\" and \"Destiny\", a first-person shooter game with similar overall mechanics regarding items, crafting, and \"shared world\" elements. The game was also compared to \"modern\" massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG), explaining that \"structurally, it all feels like it could have been ripped from \"Guild Wars 2\" or a latter-day \"World of Warcraft,\"\" including \"that old MMO staple of being stuck in a server queue before diving into a game\" on-launch, in combination with the \"quintessential Ubisoft design style\" of varying types of collectible and upgrade systems. \"The Division\" was criticized for lacking variety in its activities and missions, explaining that it \"does little to break from or advance what is fast becoming the general form of the \"loot shooter\" genre. In fact, it takes very few risks at all, particularly with its enemies and encounter design.\" The Dark Zone was described as being \"harrowing\", but was panned for sharing characteristics with the post-game content of \"Destiny\", as being the only means of obtaining higher-level gear that is, ultimately, only theoretically needed for further play in the Dark Zone, and for not introducing any major differences in gameplay mechanics like the raids of \"Destiny\".\n\nVince Ingenito of \"IGN\" was more critical of \"The Division\", outlining that \"next to every good thing \"The Division\" does, there hangs a big, ugly asterisk\". The overall atmosphere was panned for being \"barren and unengaging\" overall; as examples, Ingenito focused upon the lack of dynamic events in the game world, that there were \"long stretches of eventless walking where very little happens\" due to the lack of events and encounters, the lack of variety in missions and activities, and that the grid layout of Manhattan made navigation and exploration \"tedious\". The gun mechanics of \"The Division\" were described as being \"standard\" and more in line with the more realistic feel of other \"Tom Clancy\"-branded games, with guns that had distinct feels due to their varying statistics, and that \"the fact that the action leans so heavily on smart tactics makes it rewarding when the last foe in a pack finally goes down.\" \n\nThe progression system was also criticized for being \"fractured\", requiring that players visit multiple locations with different systems in order to upgrade their abilities, explaining that \"[it's] hard to accurately gauge just how strong you really are, and as a result, easy to get in over your head in a mission that your character level indicates you can handle.\" While noting that its \"post-game\" content was mainly limited to harder versions of story missions with stronger \"bullet sponge\" enemies, Ingenito praised the Dark Zone for \"[fixing] just about every problem I have with \"The Division's\" pacing, its lack of player-driven moments, and the overall toothlessness and emptiness of its open world\", by adding an \"omnipresent\" danger and a higher degree of risk to player interactions. In conclusion, Ingenito felt that the game's ideas and mechanics were \"not spread evenly or interwoven cleanly enough to form a cohesive, consistently enjoyable loop\".\n\nPrior to version 1.0.2 of the game, named enemy NPCs would respawn indefinitely, as long as their entourage of minions were never killed. This allowed players to collect the named enemies' superior and high-end loot over and over again. The most popular target of this exploit was a character known as the Bullet King, as this character was the named enemy closest to any player spawn point in the game. The glitch has been resolved in patch 1.0.2 of the game, released by Ubisoft on March 22, 2016.\n\nAccording to Ubisoft, the game broke company records, including highest number of first-day sales (breaking the record previously set by \"Watch Dogs\" in 2014), and becoming the company's best-selling game. \"The Division\" also broke the industry record for biggest first-week launch for a new game franchise, generating an estimated amount of $330 million globally. The retail version of \"The Division\" was the best selling game in its week of release in the U.K. and Ireland, debuting at No. 1 in the UK retail software sales chart. The game's launch marked the biggest video game debut in the first quarter of the year in the U.K., breaking the record previously held by Sony's \"Gran Turismo 4\". It was the third biggest launch of a Ubisoft game in the U.K., behind \"Assassin's Creed III\" and \"Watch Dogs\". The game has the highest week one sales for a new intellectual property, breaking the record held by \"Destiny\". The game was No. 1 in Japan, selling over 80,000 units in its first week. The NPD Group indicated that the retail version of \"The Division\" was the best selling game in March 2016 in the U.S.\n\nIn June 2016, it was announced that a live action feature film adaption of \"The Division\" is in development, with Jake Gyllenhaal in the starring role. Gyllenhaal will co-produce the film with CEO of Ubisoft, Gerard Guillemot. By August of the same year, Jessica Chastain was cast in the co-starring role of the film. \n\nBy January 2017, Stephen Gaghan was attached to direct, though he left the project in 2018. In April 2018, David Leitch signed on to direct/co-produce the film. Kelly McCormick, Gyllenhaal, Riva Marker, Chastain and Kelly Carmichael will co-produce.\n\nOn 9 March 2018, a sequel to the game, \"Tom Clancy's The Division 2\", was announced, that was currently being worked on by Massive Entertainment. The game was officially premiered at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018 in June 2018. On June 10, 2018, \"Tom Clancy’s The Division 2\" was announced to be released on 15 March 2019, with the game set to take place within Washington D.C. after it falls into anarchy, and six months after the events of \"Tom Clancy's The Division\".\n\n"}
{"id": "15824880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15824880", "title": "Trapline", "text": "Trapline\n\nIn the fur trade, a trapline is a route along which a trapper sets traps for his or her quarry. Trappers traditionally move habitually along the route to set and check the traps, in so doing become skilled at traversing remote terrain, and become experts in the geography of the local area. Because of this traditional knowledge, traplines are not only of interest to trappers themselves but to researchers and others (governments, corporations) interested in local history, biology, and topography. The assignment of particular trapline territories to individuals in band societies was traditionally handled by group consensus, and occasionally violence and warfare. In the present-day trapline assignment is typically formalized and controlled by the state. Formalized trapline territory boundaries now form the basis for many major land-use projects in fur-rich regions.\n\nOne of the entitlements that goes along with possessing a trap territory is the right to erect a trapper’s cabin: a simple shelter in which a trapper can stay while moving around his territory. Trappers' cabins are a cultural icon of fur regions, and an important part of the national mythos of countries and regions such as Canada and Alaska, and among groups such as the Métis.\n\nBefore European colonisation, determining where a particular family or band could hunt, fish, and gather without encroaching on others to the point of over-harvesting was the main preoccupation of indigenous governance in the subarctic and other non-farming regions. Councils were convened to reconcile disputes and warfare was always a possibility.\n\nWhen European traders began exporting bulk amounts of fur to Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the trapping territories of the subarctic became much more commercially valuable and disputes intensified.\n\nIn Canada formal trapping territories assigned by the state are typically called \"registered traplines\" (RTLs), though each province administers its own system; they have been common across Canada since the 1930s.\n\nAlberta's registered traplines were once exactly that: lines which followed a creek or other feature, but in the 1960s they were switched to a system of trapping territories.\n\nIn British Columbia \"the registered trapline system continues to be the primary system for setting harvest guidelines and managing furbearing animals\". It is an offence to trap an animal on a registered trapline that does not belong to you in BC.\n\nManitoba has had registered traplines since 1940; they were brought in at that time to stop a wave of new arrivals in Northern Manitoba from trapping out an area that was already overharvested by the local, mostly First Nations, population. The system is administered under the province's \"Wildlife Act\". Lines cannot be sold, inherited, or handed down, but are awarded through a points system, where preference is given to people with a close family relationship to the previous lineholder, a history of using that trapline with the permission of the previous lienholder, and residency near the territory.\n\nSince the 2001 \"Paix des braves\" agreement, trapline territories have been used as the basis for forestry and mining planning in the Eeyou Istchee territory, in Quebec.\n\nIndigenous peoples have not always welcomed the regulation of the fur industry by provincial authorities, and the assignment of trapping territories by the provincial Crown implies that the land is ultimately the property of the province, to be disposed of at its will, rather than subject to comanagement under the terms of the treaties. Furthermore, having to apply to provincial authorities to distribute traplines removes control of the process from local Indigenous forms of governance, and institutionalizes a non-Indigenous presence on traditional lands. Nevertheless, as registered traplines provide Aboriginal peoples with legal rights to a piece of land off-reserve, a potential economic livelihood, and a connection to a traditional lifestyle, registered traplines are considered of the utmost importance for many First Nations and Metis communities.\n"}
