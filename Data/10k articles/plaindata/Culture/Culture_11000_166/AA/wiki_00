The Beast from Space) is a 1957 American black and white science fiction monster film, produced by Charles H. Schneer's Morningside Productions for Columbia Pictures, directed by Nathan H. Juran, that stars William Hopper, Joan Taylor, and Frank Puglia. The screenplay was written by Bob Williams and Christopher Knopf from an original treatment by Charlott Knight. As with several other Schneer-Columbia collaborations, the film was developed to showcase the stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen.\n\nOff the coast of Sicily, fishermen watch as a large spaceship, the XY-21, crashes into the sea. They row to the spacecraft, enter through a hole in the spacecraft and pull two spacemen from the nose-down craft before it completely sinks.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Major General A.D. McIntosh discovers that the missing spaceship, piloted by Colonel Bob Calder, has been located. As McIntosh flies to the site, Pepe, a little boy, finds and opens a translucent cylinder marked “USAF” on the beach. It contains a gelatinous mass, which he sells to Dr. Leonardo, a zoologist studying sea creatures. Meanwhile, Leonardo's granddaughter Marisa, a third-year medical student, is summoned to take care of the injured spacemen. When Calder regains consciousness, he finds his crewmate, Dr. Sharman, in the last throes of the fatal disease that killed his other eight crewmen.\n\nAfter Marisa returns to the trailer shared with her grandfather, a small creature hatches from the mass, and Leonardo locks it in a cage. By morning, the creature has tripled in size. McIntosh arrives, accompanied by scientist Dr. Justin Uhl, and meets with two representatives of the Italian government, informing them the spaceship has returned from Venus. Leonardo and Marisa hitch the trailer to their truck and head for Rome. Calder's spacecraft carried a sealed metal container bearing an unborn Venusian species. As police divers begin to search for it, McIntosh offers a half-million lira reward for the capsule's recovery, prompting Pepe to lead them to the empty container. When Pepe tells them that he sold the mass to Dr. Leonardo, McIntosh and Calder pursue him.\n\nThat night, Leonardo discovers that the creature has grown to human size. Soon after, it breaks out of the cage and heads to a nearby farm, terrorizing the animals. The creature eats sulfur and rips open several bags it discovers in a barn. While feeding, the creature is attacked by the farmer's dog, and the creature kills the dog, alerting the farmer. Calder and the others reach the barn, trapping the creature inside. Calder explains that the creature is not dangerous unless provoked. However, he provokes it by trying to prod the creature with a pole into a cage-like cart, and the creature injures the farmer after he stabs the creature with a pitchfork. After the creature breaks out of the barn and disappears into the countryside, the police commissioner insists that it must be destroyed.\n\nAfter the Italian government grants Calder permission to capture the creature alive, he devises a plan to ensnare it in a giant electric net dropped from a helicopter. The Italian police conduct their own pursuit, shooting at it with flamethrowers. Gunfire has little effect on the creature, as it has no heart or lungs. Aware that sulfur is the creature's food of choice, Calder uses bags of sulfur as bait, luring the creature to a secluded site and subduing it with an electric jolt from the net. Later, at the American Embassy in Rome, McIntosh briefs the press corps and allows three reporters to view the creature, which has been placed in the Rome zoo. There, Calder explains that the creature is being sedated with a continuous electric shock so it can be studied. Marisa, who is aiding her uncle, begins flirting with Calder. Suddenly, electrical equipment shorts out and the creature awakens.\n\nThe creature battles a zoo elephant and sends the panicked patrons scurrying. Taking their fight to the streets of Rome, the two beasts destroy cars and damage buildings. The creature finally wounds the elephant badly and continues its rampage. Calder rams the creature with his car and tracks the creature to the River Tiber, where it submerges. Soldiers lob grenades into the river, and the creature surfaces, now gargantuan in size. It heads for the Colosseum and destroys an ancient temple, killing a few soldiers. As the creature disappears into the ruins, Calder charges after it with a group of bazooka-carrying soldiers, driving it to the top of the structure. Calder scores a direct bazooka hit. Direct fire from a tank then destroys the ledge the creature is clinging to, and it plunges to its death. A relieved Marisa runs into Calder's arms.\n\n\"20 Million Miles to Earth\" began production in Rome, Italy in September 1956, using only William Hopper of the main cast, and moved to the U.S. from October 30 to November 9 of that year. Rome was chosen as the location for filming because Harryhausen wanted to vacation there. The working title of the film was \"The Giant Ymir\", and it has also been released as \"The Beast from Space\". All references to the name Ymir were removed from the released version of the film, as Harryhausen was concerned that audiences might confuse it with the Arabic title \"Emir\". Most of the noises made by Ymir are recordings of elephant noises played at a higher speed.\n\nRay Harryhausen wanted the film to be shot in color, but the filmmakers were not given a budget large enough to accommodate color filming. In 2007, five years after the death of the film's director, Harryhausen worked with restoration and colorization company Legend Films to create a colorized version of the film. That version, along with the original theatrical black-and-white version, was released on July 31, 2007 on DVD as part of a 50th Anniversary Edition of the film.\n\nThere are minor differences between the two versions. One example: the black-and-white version begins in \"A Fishing Village in Sicily\", not Sperlonga, Italy.\n\nIt was the first of three collaborations between Harryhausen, Schneer, and Nathan Juran. Juran only directed the American sequences, while Schneer and Harryhausen directed the Italian sequences.\n\n\"20 Million Miles to Earth\" has an 80% positive rating at the film review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on ten reviews. Marco Lanzagorta of \"PopMatters\" gave the film 9 out of 10 stars, calling it \"required viewing for those interested in modern cinema\".\n\n\"Time Out\" wrote, \"Don't worry about the dotty script or cardboard performances - just sit back and watch this gelatinous blob in action\"; while the \"Radio Times\" called it \"one of animation master Ray Harryhausen's best fantasy films, and his own personal favourite. The snake-tailed giant ymir creature is also one of Harryhausen's finest creations: It has a well-defined personality and manages to evoke sympathy for its bewildered plight. The ymir's fight with an elephant and the Roman locations - especially the climactic Colosseum battle - add unique touches to this minor classic\".\n\nThe four-issue comic book mini-series \"20 Million Miles More\" (2008), released by TidalWave Productions as part of their Ray Harryhausen Signature Series, picked up the story 50 years after the events of the film. A preview of the first issue was included on the 50th Anniversary DVD release of the film.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12726481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12726481", "title": "Art of Champa", "text": "Art of Champa\n\nChampa was an Indic civilization that flourished along the coasts of what is now central and southern Vietnam for roughly a one thousand-year period between 500 and 1500 AD. The original Chams were probably colonists from the Indonesian islands, who adopted as their principal vocations those of trade, shipping, and piracy. Their cities were ports of call on important trade routes linking India, China and the Indonesian islands. The history of Champa was one of intermittent conflict and cooperation with the people of Java, the Khmer of Angkor in Cambodia and the Đại Việt of what is now northern Vietnam. It was to the Đại Việt that Champa finally lost its independence.\n\nThe artistic legacy of Champa consists primarily of sandstone sculptures - both sculpture in the round and relief sculpture - and brick buildings. Some metal statues and decorative items have also survived. Much of the remaining art expresses religious themes, and though some pieces would have been purely decorative, others would have served important functions in the religious life of the Chams, which synthesized elements of Hinduism (especially Saivism), Buddhism and indigenous cults.\n\nThis artistic legacy has been decimated by neglect, war, and vandalism. Much of the damage has been done in the 20th century. Some French scholars such as Henri Parmentier and Jean Boisselier were able to take photographs, create drawings, and pen descriptions of works which have been destroyed in the meantime. Neglect continues to endanger the legacy of Champa to this day, especially the neglect of the inscribed stone steles, the source of much valuable information on the history of Champa. The participants in the Vietnam War wrought their share of devastation, wiping out for example the vestiges of the Buddhist monastery at Dong Duong (Quảng Nam). Willful vandalism and pilfering are an ongoing concern.\n\nThe largest collection of Cham art is on exhibit at the Museum of Cham Sculpture in Da Nang. Substantial collections are housed in the Guimet Museum in Paris, the Museum of Vietnamese History in Saigon, and the Museum of History in Hanoi. Smaller collections may be found in the Museum of Fine Arts in Saigon and the Museum of Fine Arts in Hanoi.\n\nThe remnants of classical Cham art extant today consist mainly in temples of brick, sandstone sculptures in the round, and sandstone sculptures in high and low relief. A few bronze sculptures and decorative items made of metal remain as well. There are no works of marble or other higher quality stone. Likewise there are no paintings or sketches. The people of Champa wrote, and perhaps also sketched, on leaves, which have not withstood the hot and humid climate of coastal Vietnam. Items made of perishable materials, such as wood, for the most part have not survived.\n\nThe remaining works of art made of metal include bronze statues of the Mahayanist deities Lokesvara and Tara dated approximately 900 AD and associated with the Buddhist art of Dong Duong. An even older bronze statue of the Buddha bears a strong resemblance to Indian Buddhist statues of the Amaravati style; scholars doubt that it was originally from Champa, surmising instead that it must have come into the country as part of the maritime trade that linked India with Southeast Asia and China.\nWe have abundant textual evidence of much classical Cham art that once existed that has been lost to the ravages of time and the depredations of human vandals, looters, and conquerors. For example, the early 14th-century Chinese historian Ma Duanlin reported the existence of a large statue of the Buddha made of gold and silver; the current whereabouts of this statue are unknown. The Cham kings themselves have left us stone inscriptions describing the gifts of now lost precious objects they made to the shrines and sanctuaries of the realm. Especially noteworthy was the practice of donating decorated metallic sleeves (\"kosa\") and diadems (\"mukuta\") to important lingas and the divinities with which they were affiliated. For example, an inscription on a stone stele dated approximately 1080 and found at Mỹ Sơn reports that King Harivarman donated a \"large, resplendent golden \"kosa\" adorned with the most beautiful jewels, more brilliant than the sun, illuminated day and night by the rays of shining gems, decorated by four faces\" to the deity Srisanabhadresvara, a local embodiment of Siva. A few years later, around 1088, Harivarman may have been outdone by his successor Indravarman, who donated a golden \"kosa\" with six faces (facing in the four cardinal directions, toward the Northeast and the Southeast) topped off by a \"nagaraja\" (serpent-king) ornament, and decorated with precious gemstones including a ruby, a sapphire, a topaz, and a pearl. Neither of these treasures has survived.\n\nThe written sources, including the Chinese books of history and the Cham inscriptions, also report on some of the catastrophic events, primarily acts of war, that led to the loss of Cham art. In the second quarter of the 5th century AD, according to the historian Ma Duanlin, a Chinese general named Yuen Kan sacked the capital of Champa, making off with many \"rare and precious objects\", including \"tens of thousands of pounds of gold in ingots coming from statues which he had smelted.\" Similarly, at the beginning of the 7th century a marauding Chinese general named Liu Fang made off with \"eighteen massive tablets of gold\" commemorating the 18 previous kings of Champa. It is to be assumed that in the centuries that followed, frequent raids and conquests by Khmer and Vietnamese armies, which led to the eventual destruction of Champa as an independent political entity, likewise resulted in the removal of any portable works of art, including of course any works made of precious metals.\n\nUnlike the Khmer of Angkor, who for the most part employed a grey sandstone to construct their religious buildings, the Cham built their temples from reddish bricks. Some of these brick structures can be still be visited in the Vietnamese countryside. The most important remaining sites include Mỹ Sơn near Da Nang, Po Nagar near Nha Trang, and Po Klong Garai near Phan Rang.\n\nTypically, a Cham temple complex consisted of several different kinds of buildings.\nThese building types are typical for Hindu temples in general; the classification is valid not only for the architecture of Champa, but also for other architectural traditions of Greater India.\n\nThe culturally most important temples of historical Champa were the temple of Bhadresvara located at Mỹ Sơn near modern Da Nang, and the temple of the goddess known as Bhagavati (her Hindu name) or Yan Po Nagar (her Cham name) located just outside modern Nha Trang.\n\nThe Cham created freestanding sandstone sculptures in the round, as well as high and bas-relief carvings of sandstone. In general, they appear to have preferred sculpting in relief, and they excelled especially at sculpture in high relief. Cham sculpture went through a marked succession of historical styles, the foremost of which produced some of the best works of Southeast Asian art.\n\nThe subject-matter of Cham sculpture is drawn mostly from the legends and religion of Indian civilization. Many of the sculptures are representations of particular Hindu and Buddhist deities, most prominently Siva, but also Lokesvara, Visnu, Brahma, Devi, and Shakti. Such sculptures may have served a religious purpose rather than being purely decorative. Any sculpture in the round of an important deity that is completely forward-oriented, not engaged in any particular action, and equipped with symbolic paraphernalia, would have been a candidate for ritual or devotional use. Cham sculptors also created numerous lingas, phallic posts linked symbolically with Siva (if the cross-section is a circle) or with the trimurti (if the post is segmented, consisting of a lower square section symbolic of Brahma, a middle octagonal section symbolic of Visnu, and a top circular section symbolic of Siva). The ritual uses of the linga are familiar from modern Hinduism.\nA few of the sculptures in the art of Champa depart from the Indian subject-matter to reveal something of the life of the historical Cham people. An example are the especially well-executed representations of elephants that serve as decorative details in some pieces: from written sources we know that the Cham relied on elephants for military and other purposes, since they lacked a steady supply of horses. Other sculptures reflect the cultural legacy of Greater India and express legendary themes more typical of Javanese or Cambodian art than the art of India. An example of such a theme is the motif of the makara sea-monster, which came to Champa from Java, where it is prominent in the art of the Borobudur and other temples of the same period.\n\nScholars agree that it is possible to analyze the art of Champa in terms of distinct \"styles\" typical for various historical periods and different locations. Several have attempted through their study to set down a classification of historical styles. Perhaps the most influential of these attempts are those of the French scholars Philippe Stern (\"The Art of Champa (formerly Annam) and its Evolution\", 1942) and Jean Boisselier (\"Statuary of Champa\", 1963). Summarizing the conclusions of these scholars, art historian Jean-François Hubert has concluded that it is possible to distinguish at least the following styles and sub-styles:\nEach style is named after a place in Vietnam at which works exemplative of that style have been found.\n\nThe ruins at Mỹ Sơn are not all of the same style and do not all belong to the same period of Cham history. Scholars have coded the ruins to reflect the diversity of periods and styles. The earliest identifiable style has been dubbed the Mỹ Sơn E1 Style. It is named after a particular structure, which scholars refer to as Mỹ Sơn E1. Works of this style reflect foreign influence from a variety of sources, primarily from the Khmer of pre-Angkorian Cambodia, but also from the art of Dvaravati, the Javanese art of Indonesia, and of southern India.\n\nPerhaps the most famous work of the Mỹ Sơn E1 style is a large sandstone pedestal dated from the second half of the 7th century. Originally, the pedestal had a religious function, and was used to support a huge lingam as a symbol for Siva, the primary deity in Cham religion. The pedestal itself is decorated with relief carvings featuring scenes from the lives of ascetics: ascetics playing various musical instrument, an ascetic preaching to animals, an ascetic receiving a massage. To the Cham, the pedestal symbolized Mount Kailasa, the mythological abode of Siva which also accommodated numerous forest- and cave-dwelling ascetics, just as the lingam it supported represented the god himself.\n\nAnother important work of the Mỹ Sơn E1 style is the unfinished sandstone pediment that was once affixed over the main entrance to the temple at Mỹ Sơn E1. The pediment shows the dawn of the present era according to Hindu mythology. Vishnu is reclining at the bottom of the ocean. His bed is Sesha the serpent. A lotus grows upwards from Vishnu's navel, and Brahma emerges from the lotus in order to recreate the universe.\n\nIn 875, the Cham king Indravarman II founded a new dynasty at Indrapura, in what is now the Quảng Nam region of central Vietnam. Departing from the religious traditions of his predecessors, who were predominantly Shaivists, he founded the Mahayana Buddhist monastery of Dong Duong, and dedicated the central temple to Lokesvara. The temple complex at Dong Duong having been devastated by bombing during the Vietnam War, our knowledge of its appearance is limited to the photographs and descriptions created by French scholars earlier in the 20th century. A fair number of sculptures of the period have survived, however, in the museums of Vietnam, and collectively they are known as the works of the Dong Duong Style. The style lasted until well into the 10th century.\n\nThe Dong Duong style of sculpture has been described as a highly original style of \"artistic extremism\", \"with exaggerated, almost excessively stylized features.\" The figures are characterized by their thick noses and lips and by the fact that they do not smile. Prominent motifs include scenes from the life of the Buddha, Buddhist monks, dharmapalas (guardians of the Buddhist law), dvarapalas (armed temple guardians), the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, and the goddess of compassion Tara, who was also regarded as the shakti or spouse of Avalokiteshvara.\n\nThe art of the Mỹ Sơn A1 style belongs to the 10th and 11th centuries, a period of Hindu revival following the Buddhist period of Dong Duong, and also a period of renewed influence from Java. This period has been called the \"golden age\" of Cham Art. The style is named after a temple at Mỹ Sơn, \"the most perfect expression of Cham architecture\" according to art historian Emmanuel Guillon, that fell victim to the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Most of the remaining monuments at Mỹ Sơn also belong to the Mỹ Sơn A1 style, including most of the constructions of groups B, C, and D.\n\nAs to the sculpture of the Mỹ Sơn A1 style, it is known as being light and graceful, in contrast with the more severe style of Dong Duong. According to Guillon, \"It is an art of dance and movement, of grace, and of faces which sometimes wear a slight, almost ironic style, as though surprised by their own beauty.\" Indeed, dancers were a favorite motif of the Mỹ Sơn A1 sculptors. The style is also known for its fine relief images of real and mythical animals such as elephants, lions and garudas.\n\nThe Mỹ Sơn A1 style encompasses not only works of art found at Mỹ Sơn, but also works found at Khuong My and Trà Kiệu, though the latter are sometimes treated as representing distinct styles. The works of Khuong My in particular are frequently treated as transitional between the styles of Dong Duong and Mỹ Sơn A1. Likewise, works found at Chanh Lo are sometimes treated as belonging to the Mỹ Sơn A1 style and sometimes treated as transitional between the Mỹ Sơn A1 and Thap Mam styles.\n\nIn the village of Khuong My in the Vietnamese province of Quảng Nam stands a group of three Cham towers dating from the 10th century. The style of the towers and the artwork associated with them is transitional between the powerful style of Dong Duong and the more charming and delicate Mỹ Sơn A1 style. The style of Khuong My also exhibits Khmer and Javanese influence.\n\nAlthough the Cham monuments at Trà Kiệu in Quảng Nam Province have been destroyed, a number of magnificent pieces of sculpture associated with the site remain and are preserved in museums. Especially noteworthy are a large pedestal serving as a base for a lingam that is known simply as the \"Trà Kiệu Pedestal\" and another pedestal known as the \"Dancers' Pedestal.\"\n\nThe Trà Kiệu Pedestal, consisting of a base decorated with friezes in bas relief, an ablutionary cistern, and a massive lingam, is regarded as one of the masterpieces of Cham art. The figures on the friezes are especially beautiful, and represent episodes from the life of Krishna as related in the Bhagavata Purana. At each corner of the pedestal, a leonine atlas appears to support the weight of the structure above him.\n\nThe Dancers' Pedestal, likewise, is regarded as a masterpiece. The purpose and function of the pedestal, which has the shape of a corner piece, remain obscure. Each side of the corner is graced by a dancing apsara and a music-playing gandharva. The base underneath these figures is adorned with leonine heads and makaras.\n\nAfter the 10th century, Cham art went into gradual decline. Both architecture, as exemplified by the temples of Po Nagar and Po Klong Garai, and sculpture became more stereotyped and less original. Only the sculptures of mythical animals, such as the makara or the garuda, could rival their counterparts of the earlier styles.\n\nThe Thap Mam Style of the 11th through the 14th centuries is named for an archaeological site in Bình Định Province, formerly Vijaya. The sculpture of this style is characterized by \"a return to hieratic formalism and the simplification of shape, leading to a certain loss of vitality.\" The sculptors seem to have been concerned more with the detail of ornamentation than with the grace and motion of the figures themselves. Indeed, the style has been characterized as \"baroque\", in reference to the proliferation of ornamental details that distinguishes it from its more \"classical\" predecessors.\n\nOne of the most original motifs of the Thap Mam period was the sculpting in stone of a row of female breasts around the base of a pedestal. The motif first emerged in the 10th century (the Trà Kiệu Pedestal at one point had such a row of breasts) and became characteristic of the Thap Mam Style. It appears to have no counterpart in the art of other Southeast Asian countries. Some scholars have identified this theme with figure of Uroja (\"breasts\"), the mythical ancestor of an 11th-century dynasty at Mỹ Sơn, and claim a connection between this Uroja and the goddess venerated at Po Nagar.\n\n\n\n"}

The book models the animal world in a minimalistic and constructive way, from simple reactive behaviours (like phototaxis) through the simplest vehicles, to the formation of concepts, spatial behaviour, and generation of ideas.\n\nFor the simplest vehicles, the motion of the vehicle is directly controlled by some sensors (for example photo cells). Yet the resulting behaviour may appear complex or even intelligent.\n\nA Braitenberg vehicle is an agent that can autonomously move around based on its sensor inputs. It has primitive sensors that measure some stimulus at a point, and wheels (each driven by its own motor) that function as actuators or effectors. In the simplest configuration, a sensor is directly connected to an effector, so that a sensed signal immediately produces a movement of the wheel.\n\nDepending on how sensors and wheels are connected, the vehicle exhibits different behaviors (which can be goal-oriented). This means that, depending on the sensor-motor wiring, it appears to strive to achieve certain situations and to avoid others, changing course when the situation changes.\n\nThe connections between sensors and actuators for the simplest vehicles (2 and 3) can be ipsilateral or contralateral, and excitatory or inhibitory, producing four combinations with different behaviours named fear, aggression, liking, and love. These correspond to biological positive and negative taxes present in many animals species.\n\nThe following examples are some of Braitenberg's simplest vehicles.\n\nThe first vehicle has one sensor (e.g. a temperature detector) that directly stimulates its single wheel in a directly proportional way. The vehicle moves ideally in one dimension only and can stand still or move forward at varying speed depending on the sensed temperature. When forces like asymmetric friction come into play, the vehicle could deviate from its straight line motion in unpredictable ways akin to Brownian motion.\n\nThis behavior might be understood by a human observer as a creature that is 'alive' like an insect and 'restless', never stopping in its movement. The low velocity in regions of low temperature might be interpreted as a preference for cold areas.\n\nA slightly more complex agent has two (left and right) symmetric sensors (e.g. light detectors) each stimulating a wheel on the same side of the body. This vehicle represents a model of negative animal tropotaxis. It obeys the following rule:\nThis is more efficient as a behavior to escape from the light source, since the creature can move in different directions, and tends to orient towards the direction from which least light comes.\n\nIn another variation, the connections are negative or inhibitory: more light → slower movement. In this case, the agents move away from the dark and towards the light.\n\nThe agent has the same two (left and right) symmetric sensors (e.g. light detectors), but each one stimulating a wheel on the other side of the body. It obeys the following rule:\nAs a result, the robot follows the light; it moves to be closer to the light.\n\nIn a complex environment with several sources of stimulus, Braitenberg vehicles will exhibit complex and dynamic behavior.\n\nDepending on the connections between sensors and actuators, a Braitenberg vehicle might move close to a source, but not touch it, run away very fast, or describe circles or figures-of-eight around a point.\n\nThis behavior is undoubtedly goal-directed, flexible and adaptive, and might even appear to be intelligent, the way some minimal intelligence is attributed to a cockroach. Yet, the functioning of the agent is purely mechanical, without any information processing or other apparently cognitive processes.\n\nOften, BEAM robotics implements these sorts of behaviors.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31547233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31547233", "title": "Cultural history of the buttocks", "text": "Cultural history of the buttocks\n\nSexualization of the buttocks, especially of the female gender, has occurred throughout history.\n\nSexologist Alfred Kinsey suggested that the buttocks is the primary sexual presentation site in primates. Some anthropologists and sociobiologists believe that breast fetishism derives from the breasts' similarity to buttocks, but instead provide sexual attraction from the front of the body.\n\nIn humans, females generally have more round and voluptuous buttocks, caused by estrogen that encourages the body to store fat in the buttocks, hips, and thighs. Testosterone discourages fat storage in these areas. The buttocks in human females thus contain more adipose tissue than in males, especially after puberty. Evolutionary psychologists suggest that rounded buttocks may have evolved as a desirable trait because they provide a visual indication of the woman's youth and fertility. They signal the presence of estrogen and the presence of sufficient fat stores for pregnancy and lactation. Additionally, the buttocks give an indication of the shape and size of the pelvis, which impacts reproductive capability. Since development and pronunciation of the buttocks begins at menarche and declines with age, full buttocks are also a symbol of youth.\n\nBiological anthropologist Helen B. Fisher said that \"perhaps, the fleshy, rounded buttocks attracted males during rear-entry intercourse\". In a recent study, using 3D models and eye-tracking technology Fisher's claim was tested and was shown that the slight thrusting out of a woman's back influence how attractive others perceive her to be and captures the gaze of both men and women. Bobbi S. Low et al. said that the female buttocks \"evolved in the context of females competing for the attention and parental commitment of powerful resource-controlling males\" as an \"honest display of fat reserves\" that could not be confused with another type of tissue, although T. M. Caro rejected that as being a necessary conclusion, stating that female fatty deposits on the hips improve individual fitness of the female, regardless of sexual selection.\n\nThe female buttocks have been a symbol of fertility and beauty since early human history. Statues created as early as 24,000 BC, such as the Venus of Willendorf, have exaggerated buttocks, hips, and thighs.\n\nThe erotic beauty of the female buttocks was important to the ancient Greeks, thought to have built such statues as Venus Kallipygos (although only a possible Roman copy survives), that emphasize the buttocks. Bare buttocks were also considered erotic in Ming China, where they were often compared to the bright full moon. Many artists pose models to emphasize the buttocks. 19th Century Europeans sought to profit from this unique feature of African women through objectification and exploitation by placing Saartjie Baartman on display in a Human zoo.\n\nThe buttocks have been considered an erogenous zone in Western thought for centuries; the eroticization of the female buttocks was heteronormative due to their association and closeness to the female reproductive organs. The buttocks are often taboo due to their proximity to the anus and association with the excretory system. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud theorized that psychosexual development occurred in three stages—oral, anal, and genital—and that fixation in the anal stage caused anal retentiveness and a lasting focus on eroticization of the anus.\n\nErotic spanking was popular in Victorian Britain, perhaps due to the buttocks' fetishization and eroticization. Spanking was prominent in pornography during this time, with erotica such as \"Lady Bumtickler's Revels\" and \"Exhibition of Female Flagellants\" being consumed.\n\nIn \"Studies in the Psychology of Sex\", published in 1927 and written by British physician and sexual psychologist Havelock Ellis, he describes cultural sexual characteristics of the buttocks. He says:\nHe adds that\nEllis also claims that corsets and bustles are meant to emphasize the buttocks.\n\nEmphasis on the female buttocks as a sexual characteristic has increased in recent times according to Ray B. Browne, who attributes the change to the popularization of denim jeans:\n\nWhile female buttocks are often eroticized in heterosexual erotica, men's buttocks are considered erogenous by many women, and are also eroticized in gay male circles. Much of gay male sexuality centres on anal intercourse and penetration, so the buttocks are eroticized in that sector due to their proximity to the anus and the genitals.\n\nNumerous songs have also been about the desirability of buttocks:\n\nSince the early 2000s, songs about the female buttocks have proliferated, especially in the hip-hop, reggae/dancehall, and R&B genres.\n\nButtocks are often emphasized in pornography. Patricia Hill Collins, an African-American post-modern feminist writer, theorizes that this is derived from a stereotype that black women are promiscuous, and their buttocks are objectified by pornography as a result.\n\nA buttocks fetish or buttocks partialism refers to a condition wherein the buttocks becomes a primary focus of sexual attention. It may be associated with coprophilia, panty fetishism, eproctophilia, and sadomasochistic corporal punishment involving the buttocks. \"Pygophilia\" refers to sexual arousal caused by the buttocks.\n\n"}

Parallel Trouble Adventure\n\nThe title refers to the fact that the story takes place in two parallel universes, a concept loosely based on multiverse theory.\n\n22 years ago, a huge alien artifact is found on a construction site by a worker named Yotsuga. The foreman orders that the artifact be broken apart to avoid delays. As Yotsuga walks towards the dumpsters to dispose of a small piece of the artifact, the world splits into two. In one world, Yotsuga tosses away the piece and the artifact is destroyed. In the other world, Yotsuga keeps the artifact, leading to the discovery of extraterrestrial technology that changes history.\n\nIn the present, Kazuki Yotsuga is a high school student who is shunned by other students as an otaku; his web site describes battles between giant robots that only he can see, but it is mostly as a result of him being occasionally seen by the other students reacting to their \"presence\". One day, the most popular girl in school, Mitsuki Sanada, approaches him to tell him that she likes his stories. This is only a ruse; she lures him to her father, Dr. Ken Sanada, who wishes to study Kazuki for his research on parallel worlds.\n\nAfter being thrown into the other possible world by Dr. Sanada's device (thanks to a careless action by Mitsuki), Kazuki finds himself still in Dr. Sanada's basement, but everything is covered with cobwebs. Kazuki goes home, is distracted by a real battle between two giant robots, one white and the other black. The white robot is knocked down and an injured female figure emerges from inside. When Kazuki goes to her aid, he is trapped inside the robot and somehow manages to activate it and defeat the enemy robot. Afterwards, Kazuki reaches his home, but his parents no longer recognize him. He is found by Mitsuki, who has followed him. Along with a military escort, she takes him to the Earth Defense Force HQ, a paramilitary operation led by this world's Dr. Sanada. After Kazuki learns of this world's situation and the attempted conquest of this world by this world's Dr. Rara (Dr. Sanada's arch-rival) who is using technology developed from the artifact, he volunteers to become a giant robot pilot.\n\nOver the course of the series, Kazuki manages to attract several very different women without even trying, and he becomes a hero. He is later taken prisoner by Dr. Rara, the father of this world's Mitsuki. Mitsuki Rara eventually defects and comes to live with Kazuki and her counterpart. Later on, a new type of robot made from the artifact is deployed that can cause objects and people to be shifted between the alternate worlds. During the battle against it, Kazuki and Mitsuki Sanada are sent back to their original world, and they discover their world's Dr. Sanada covered up their disappearance by claiming that they had eloped. As it turns out, the frequent travel between worlds is taking a toll on the universe itself as the barriers separating them begin to break down; this will eventually lead to both worlds vanishing. A decision must be made; since Kazuki and the alien technology are exclusive to each world, one must be eliminated to halt the destruction. The robots are destroyed, and the worlds combine into one, an expression of Kazuki's wish for all his (girl)friends to continue to stay together with him (even though the action is again caused by Mitsuki's carelessness).\n\nThe \"Tenchi Muyo! GXP\" novels, written by creator of both \"DUAL!\" and \"Tenchi Muyo!\", Masaki Kajishima, confirmed that \"DUAL!\" is in fact set in the distant past of the \"Tenchi Muyo!\" universe. \n\n\nOpening Theme:\n\nEnding Theme:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2001, there has been fan speculation about a \"Dual!\" sequel in the works, but according to AIC Anime's English website there are currently no plans to release such a sequel.\n\nIt has been confirmed by the creator of \"Tenchi Muyo!\" and \"Dual!\" that the two series are related, and in fact occur in the same universe. A mecha, confirmed in the \"Tenchi Muyo! GXP\" novels to be Zinv, is found during an episode of \"Tenchi Muyo! GXP\" which runs parallel with the \"Tenchi\" OVA Series. Miki Steinbeck, the future reincarnation of Mitsuki Sanada and Ken Manada (Ken Sanada) appear in the \"Tenchi GXP\" novels. Seina Yamada is also confirmed to be the future reincarnation of Kazuki Yotsuga. In fact, Dual! is so consistently relevant to the GXP novels they can be viewed as a distant sequel.\n\n\nSeveral elements in \"Dual!

Most of them are based on pre-existing material (\"modding\"), but some are entirely original creations.

There are also many dōjin soft titles which are completely original, or feature only vague allusions to other series.\n\nWhile most dōjin soft sales occur at anime and video game or anime conventions (such as Comiket), there is a growing number of specialized internet sites that sell them.

{"id": "2474747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2474747", "title": "Exemplum", "text": "Exemplum\n\nAn exemplum (Latin for \"example\", pl. exempla, \"exempli gratia\" = \"for example\", abbr.: \"e.g.\") is a moral anecdote, brief or extended, real or fictitious, used to illustrate a point. The word is also used to express an action performed by another and used as an example or model.\n\nThis genre sprang from the above, in classical, medieval and Renaissance literature, consisting of lives of famous figures, and using these (by emphasizing good or bad character traits) to make a moral point.\n\nCollections of Exempla helped medieval preachers to adorn their sermons, to emphasize moral conclusions or illustrate a point of doctrine. The subject matter could be taken from fables, folktales, legends, real history, or natural history. Jacques de Vitry's book of exempla, c. 1200, Nicholas Bozon's \"Les contes moralisés\" (after 1320), and Odo of Cheriton's \"Parabolae\" (after 1225) were famous medieval collections aimed particularly at preachers. Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Miller's Prologue and Tale\" became a vivid satire on this genre. There were also notable lay writers of moral tales, such as the 13th century Der Stricker and the 14th century Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena (Tales of Count Lucanor).\nExamples dealing with historical figures include:\n\n\n\"The Norton Anthology of Western Literature\" includes three exempla (singular, \"exemplum\"), stories that illustrate a general principle or underscore a moral lesson: \"The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man\" and \"The King's Tailor's Apprentice\" (both from \"The Scholar's Guide\") and \"The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck.\" \n\nIn \"The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man,\" told by the father, the three traveling companions of the tale's title are on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Near their destination, their provisions are nearly depleted, and the two city dwellers attempt to cheat the country man by telling him that whoever of them dreams the most extraordinary dream shall get the last of their bread.\n\nAs the city dwellers sleep, the country man, alert to their intended deception, eats the half-baked bread before retiring.\n\nThe city dwellers relate their made-up dreams. One says he was taken to heaven and led before God by angels. The other says that angels escorted him to hell. \n\nThe country man says he dreamed the same things that his companions dreamed and, believing them to be forever lost, one to heaven and the other to hell, ate the bread.\n\nThe son tells his father the moral of the story: \"As it says in the proverb, ‘He who wanted all, lost all.’\" He says that the two city dwellers got their just comeuppance. The story says that he wishes they’d been whipped, as the antagonist in another story he has heard, was beaten for his chicanery. His comment is a transition to the next tale, causing the father to ask his son to tell him this story. Thus, the roles of the father and his son are reversed, as the father, who was the storyteller, becomes the listener, and the son, who was his father's audience, becomes the narrator.\n\nThe son's story recounts the story of a king's tailor's assistant, a youth by the name of Nedui.\n\nOne day while he is away, his master gives the other apprentices bread and honey, but does not save any for Nedui, telling them that Nedui \"would not eat honey even if he were here.\" Upon learning that he has been left out, Nedui avenges himself upon his master by telling the eunuch whom the king has set over the apprentices as their supervisor that the tailor is subject to seizures of madness, during which he becomes violent and dangerous. In fact, Nedui claims, he has killed those who have happened to be near him when he is in the grip of such a fit. To protect himself, Nedui says, he binds and beats the tailor when such a fit comes over him. He also tells the eunuch what to look for: \"When you see him looking all around and feeling the floor with his hands and getting up from his seat and picking up the chair on which he is seated, then you will know that he is mad, and if you do not protect yourself and your servants, he will beat you on the head with a club.\"\n\nThe next day, Nedui hides the tailor's shears, and, when the master, hunting for them, behaves as Nedui mentioned to the eunuch, the eunuch orders his servants to bind the tailor and beats him himself with a club. His servants also beat him until he is unconscious and \"half dead.\"\n\nWhen he regains consciousness, the tailor asks the eunuch what crime he has committed to have deserved such a beating, and the eunuch tells him what Nedui told him about the tailor's seizures. \"Friend, when have you ever seen me crazy?\" the master asks his apprentice, to which question he receives, from Nedui, the rejoinder: \"When have you ever seen me refuse to eat honey?\"\n\nThe father tells the son the moral of the story: \"The tailor deserved his punishment because if he had kept the precept of Moses, to love his brother as himself, this would not have happened to him.\"\n\nBy having the listener tell the narrator the moral of the story, the storyteller shows that the narrative has successfully served its purpose as an exemplum, as the listener, hearing the story, shows that he is able to ascertain the moral that the tale is intended to express.\n\nThe third exemplum, \"The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck,\" is a prose, rather than a poetic, narrative. Like a mini-sermon, it preaches against wrong conduct—in this case, sacrilegious behavior. This tale has an identifiable author, Robert Mannyng, who set down the story in the early fourteenth century. \"The Norton Anthology\"'s version is translated from Middle English by Lee Patterson.\n\nTo bolster his listener's belief that \"most of\" his tale is \"the gospel truth,\" the narrator names the culprits and their victims and cites Pope Leo as one who knows (and wrote a version of) the narrative and points out that the story is \"known in the court at Rome\" and has appeared widely in many chronicles, including those \"beyond the sea.\" However, after the telling of the tale, the storyteller admits that some doubt its veracity.\n\nThe story starts by identifying several activities that are not allowed in church or in the churchyard: \"carols, wrestling, or summer games.\" In addition, \"interludes or singing, beating the tabor [a small drum], or piping. . . . while the priest is conducting mass\" are \"forbidden\" and sacrilegious, and \"good priests\" will not tolerate them.\n\nIt is also improper to dance in church, as the story that the narrator is about to tell demonstrates.\n\nWhen \"twelve fools\" in Colbeck (or, as the editors’ note explains, \"Kolbigk, in Saxony, an area in eastern Germany, just north of the present-day Czech border) decided, one Christmas Eve, to make \"a carol--madly, as a kind of challenge,\" and persisted in singing and dancing in the churchyard while the priest was trying to conduct Mass, despite his entreaties to them to stop, the priest calls upon God to curse them.\n\nThe singers’ carol contains three lines, the last of which appears to become the basis of their curse, as they are unable to leave the churchyard or to quit singing or dancing for a year after God curses them for their sacrilegious behavior:\n\nAs a result of the curse, the dancers cannot stop singing and dancing; neither can they let go of one another's hands.\n\nThe priest, too late, sends his son, Ayone, to rescue his daughter, Ave, who is one of the \"twelve fools\" involved in the dancing. However, due to the curse, when Ayone takes his sister's arm to separate her from the other carolers, it detaches from her body. Miraculously, her wound does not bleed, nor does she die from it.\n\nAyone takes the arm to his father. The priest tries, three times unsuccessfully, to bury the limb, but the grave casts it back, so the priest displays it inside the church. Everyone, including the emperor, comes to see the cursed dancers, who, despite no rest, food, drink, or sleep, dance non-stop, night and day, regardless of the temperature or the weather. Several times, the emperor orders a covering to be built to protect the dancers from storms, but it is reduced to rubble overnight each time it is built or rebuilt.\n\nAfter the year has ended, the curse is lifted, and the dancers fall down upon the ground, as if dead. Three days later, they arise—except for Ave, who has died. Soon after, the priest also dies. The emperor installs the container in the church as a receptacle for the dead girl's arm, and it becomes a holy relic commemorating the miracle of the curse.\n\nThe other dancers cannot get together again, ever, and must skip, instead of walking, wherever they go. Living mementoes of God's curse against sacrilegious behavior, they bear permanent physical changes to their clothing and their bodies: \"Their clothes didn’t rot nor their nails grow; their hair didn’t lengthen nor their complexion change. Nor did they ever have relief...\"\n\nAlthough some believe and others doubt the authenticity of the tale he's told, the narrator says he recounted the story so that his listeners, taking heed, may be \"afraid to carol in a church or churchyard, especially against the priest's will,\" as \"jangling is a form of sacrilege.\"\n\n"}

Connections to the city center are relatively poor, because of the limited public transport available (see below) and because of the need to cross areas subject to frequent traffic jams like Chirigiu Square.\n\nThe borough stretches along Ferentarilor Avenue (Calea Ferentarilor) and the main boundaries are: Salaj Road (Șoseaua Sălaj) and sometimes Rahovei Avenue (Calea Rahovei) to the South West, the industrial area, the railway and partially Progresului Road (to the South-East and East), and Salaj Road (to the West). It is bordered by the Rahova, Pieptănări and Giurgiului boroughs. These boundaries, being totally unofficial, are subject to individual interpretation.\n\nFerentari was the first modern industrial area of Bucharest developed in the middle of 19th century, when new industrial plants were built in the area and especially after the first railway in Romania was built (opened in 1869 and connecting Bucharest—via Filaret station—to Giurgiu).\n\nThe population of the neighbourhood is around 90,000. It has been assigned the lowest quota on local taxes (at the beginning of Calea Ferentarilor: B zone, the middle area: C zone, the rest: D zone).\n\nIt has a bad reputation—as being the worst borough in Bucharest as the base of drug dealers, prostitution and mob operations in Bucharest. This is confirmed by the arrests of the Cămătaru mob clan, and police raids done in the Zabrăuți section of the borough after some drug-related incidents. As such, it is the center of drug dealing in Bucharest (for example, 45 dealers have been arrested in one police action) and has been the stage of a riot, a unique event in a city with very low crime rate.\n\nHowever, Ferentari has a lower crime rate in terms of burglaries in relation to much of the city—possibly because of the poverty in the area. Areas such as Vadul Nou, Zăbrăuți, Prelungirea Ferentari, La Maici are notorious for squatting, and resorting to violence when they are served with eviction notices. Furthermore, when questioned about adequate responses to evictions, or to the police severing illegal connections to the mains, inhabitants of the neighbourhood consider violence as their main weapon, according to a sociological study by SNSPA .\n\nIn the said areas, the same article quotes that 84% of the inhabitants tap into the city's electricity grid, and 64% of the inhabitants have no access to sewage, because of their status as squatters, and their inability to sign contracts with the city. As such, the areas developed informal networks stealing power, water and even cable TV signal directly from the mains. An incident linked with disconnecting illegally connected electricity users sparked the revolt of 2006.\n\nHowever, the bad situation is not limited to the areas above. Other areas, such as the Ferentari Avenue, Salaj Road, are comparable in terms of both development and safety ratings with the rest of the city. The socially disadvantaged Roma, its reputation, and proximity with the undesirable areas, however, makes the whole borough an undesirable place to live in.\n\nThe area is served by the public transport (tramway and buses). Calea Ferentarilor prolonged by Prelungirea Ferentarilor is designed to be the connection of Bucharest to the Bucharest–Giurgiu highway.\n\nVery little public transport serves the area (3 bus lines and 3 tram lines compared to 11 tram lines, 22 bus lines and 1 trolleybus line in equally sized Rahova). Only one of the bus lines in the borough connects it with the city center, namely line 117 (the official route maps are available at ).\n\nThe future may, however, bring a great development of the area as there is a lot of spare land around (practically the entire former industrial area which is down), available at low prices, close to the city center and excellent infrastructure although unmaintained. Contributing for this are very low prices and taxes in the area.\n\n"}
{"id": "2210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210", "title": "Folklore of the United States", "text": "Folklore of the United States\n\nFolklore consists of legends, music, oral history, proverbs, jokes, popular beliefs, fairy tales, stories, tall tales, and customs that are the traditions of a culture, subculture, or group. It is also the set of practices through which those expressive genres are shared. The study of folklore is sometimes called folkloristics. In usage, there is a continuum between folklore and mythology.\n\nAmerican folklore encompasses the folk traditions that have evolved on the North American continent since Europeans arrived in the 16th century. While it contains much in the way of Native American tradition, it should not be confused with the tribal beliefs of any community of native people.\n\nNative American cultures are rich in myths and legends that explain natural phenomena and the relationship between humans and the spirit world. According to Barre Toelken, feathers, beadwork, dance steps and music, the events in a story, the shape of a dwelling, or items of traditional food can be viewed as icons of cultural meaning.\n\nNative American cultures are numerous and diverse. Though some neighboring cultures hold similar beliefs, others can be quite different from one another. The most common myths are the creation myths, that tell a story to explain how the earth was formed, and where humans and other beings came from. Others may include explanations about the sun, moon, constellations, specific animals, seasons, and weather. This is one of the ways that many tribes have kept, and continue to keep, their cultures alive; these stories are not told simply for entertainment, but as a way of preserving and transmitting the nation, tribe or band's particular beliefs, history, customs, spirituality and traditional way of life. \"[S]tories not only entertain but also embody Native behavioral and ethical values.\"\n\nThere are many different kinds of stories. Some are called \"hero stories\"; these are stories of people who lived at one time, and who were immortalized and remembered through these tales. There are \"trickster stories\", about the different trickster figures of the tribes, spirits who may be either helpful or dangerous, depending on the situation. There are also tales that are simply warnings; they warn against doing something that may harm in some way. Many of these tales have morals or some form of belief that is being taught. This is how the things were remembered.\n\nThe founding of the United States is often surrounded by legends and tall tales. Many stories have developed since the founding long ago to become a part of America's folklore and cultural awareness, and non-Native American folklore especially includes any narrative which has contributed to the shaping of American culture and belief systems. These narratives may be true and may be false or may be a little true and a little false; the veracity of the stories is not a determining factor.\n\nChristopher Columbus, as a hero and symbol to the then immigrants, is an important figure in the pantheon of American myth. His status, not unlike most American icons, is representative not of his own accomplishments, but the self-perception of the society which chose him as a hero. Having effected a separation from England and its cultural icons, America was left without history—or heroes on which to base a shared sense of their social selves. Washington Irving was instrumental in popularizing Columbus. His version of Columbus' life, published in 1829, was more a romance than a biography. The book was very popular, and contributed to an image of the discoverer as a solitary individual who challenged the unknown sea, as triumphant Americans contemplated the dangers and promise of their own wilderness frontier. As a consequence of his vision and audacity, there was now a land free from kings, a vast continent for new beginnings. In the years following the Revolution the poetic device \"Columbia\" was used as a symbol of both Columbus and America. King's College of New York changed its name in 1792 to Columbia, and the new capitol in Washington was subtitled District of Columbia.\n\nIn May 1607, the Susan Constant, the Discovery, and the Godspeed sailed through Chesapeake Bay and thirty miles up the James River settlers built Jamestown, Virginia, England's first permanent colony. Too late in the season to plant crops, many were not accustomed to manual labor. Within a few months, some settlers died of famine and disease. Only thirty-eight made it through their first year in the New World. Captain John Smith, a pirate turned gentleman turned the settlers into foragers and successful traders with the Native Americans, who taught the English how to plant corn and other crops. Smith led expeditions to explore the regions surrounding Jamestown, and it was during one of these that the chief of the Powhatan Native Americans captured Smith. According to an account Smith published in 1624, he was going to be put to death until the chief's daughter, Pocahontas, saved him. From this the legend of Pocahontas sprang forth, becoming part of American folklore, children's books, and movies.\n\nPlymouth Rock is the traditional site of disembarkation of William Bradford and the Mayflower Pilgrims who founded Plymouth Colony in 1620, and an important symbol in American history. There are no contemporary references to the Pilgrims' landing on a rock at Plymouth. The first written reference to the Pilgrims landing on a rock is found 121 years after they landed. The Rock, or one traditionally identified as it, has long been memorialized on the shore of Plymouth Harbor in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The holiday of Thanksgiving is said to have begun with the Pilgrims in 1621. They had come to America to escape religious persecution, but then nearly starved to death. Some friendly Native Americans (including Squanto) helped the Pilgrims survive through the first winter. The perseverance of the Pilgrims is celebrated during the annual Thanksgiving festival.\n\nGeorge Washington (February 22, 1732 – December 14, 1799), the country's first president, is often said to be the father of his country. Apocryphal stories about Washington's childhood include a claim that he skipped a silver dollar across the Rappahannock River at Ferry Farm. Another tale claims that as a young child, Washington chopped down his father's cherry tree. His angry father confronted the young Washington, who proclaimed \"I can not tell a lie\" and admitted to the transgression, thus illuminating his honesty. Parson Mason Locke Weems mentions the first citation of this legend in his 1806 book, \"The Life of George Washington: With Curious Anecdotes, Equally Honorable to Himself and Exemplary to His Young Countrymen\". This anecdote cannot be independently verified. Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) is also known to have spread the story while lecturing, personalizing it by adding \"I have a higher and greater standard of principle. Washington could not lie. I can lie but I won't.\"\n\nPatrick Henry (May 29, 1736 – June 6, 1799) was an attorney, planter and politician who became known as an orator during the movement for independence in Virginia in the 1770s. Patrick Henry is best known for the speech he made in the House of Burgesses on March 23, 1775, in Saint John's Church in Richmond, Virginia. With the House undecided on whether to mobilize for military action against the encroaching British military force, Henry argued in favor of mobilization. Forty-two years later, Henry's first biographer, William Wirt, working from oral histories, tried to reconstruct what Henry said. According to Wirt, Henry ended his speech with words that have since become immortalized: \"I know not what course others may take; but as for me, Give me Liberty, or give me Death!\" The crowd, by Wirt's account, jumped up and shouted \"To Arms! To Arms!\". For 160 years Wirt's account was taken at face value. In the 1970s, historians began to question the authenticity of Wirt's reconstruction.\n\nBetsy Ross (January 1, 1752 – January 30, 1836) is widely credited with making the first American flag. There is, however, no credible historical evidence that the story is true. Research conducted by the National Museum of American History notes that the story of Betsy Ross making the first American flag for General George Washington entered into American consciousness about the time of the 1876 centennial celebrations. In the 2008 book \"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Making of an American Icon\", Smithsonian experts point out that accounts of the event appealed to Americans eager for stories about the revolution and its heroes and heroines. Betsy Ross was promoted as a patriotic role model for young girls and a symbol of women's contributions to American history.\n\nOther Revolutionary War heroes who became figures of American folklore include: Benedict Arnold, Benjamin Franklin, Nathan Hale, John Hancock, John Paul Jones and Francis Marion.\n\nThe tall tale is a fundamental element of American folk literature. The tall tale's origins are seen in the bragging contests that often occurred when men of the American frontier gathered. A tall tale is a story with unbelievable elements, related as if it were true and factual. Some such stories are exaggerations of actual events; others are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting, such as the American Old West, or the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. They are usually humorous or good-natured. The line between myth and tall tale is distinguished primarily by age; many myths exaggerate the exploits of their heroes, but in tall tales the exaggeration looms large, to the extent of becoming the whole of the story.\n\n\nOther historical figures include Titanic survivor Molly Brown, Wild West showman Buffalo Bill Cody, and sharpshooter Annie Oakley.\n\n\n\nOther folkloric creatures include the fearsome Jackalope, the Nain Rouge of Detroit, Michigan, Wendigo of Minnesota and Chessie, a legendary sea monster said to live in Chesapeake Bay.\n\nSanta Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas, Father Christmas, or simply \"Santa\", is a figure with legendary, mythical, historical and folkloric origins. The modern figure of Santa Claus was derived from the Dutch figure, Sinterklaas, which may, in turn, have its origins in the hagiographical tales concerning the Christian Saint Nicholas. \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\", also known as \"The Night Before Christmas\" is a poem first published anonymously in 1823 and generally attributed to Clement Clarke Moore. The poem, which has been called \"arguably the best-known verses ever written by an American\", is largely responsible for the conception of Santa Claus from the mid-nineteenth century to today, including his physical appearance, the night of his visit, his mode of transportation, the number and names of his reindeer, as well as the tradition that he brings toys to children. The poem has influenced ideas about St. Nicholas and Santa Claus from the United States to the rest of the English-speaking world and beyond. \"Is There a Santa Claus?\" was the title of an editorial appearing in the September 21, 1897, edition of The (New York) Sun. The editorial, which included the famous reply \"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus\", has become a part of popular Christmas folklore in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe Headless Horseman is a fictional character from the short story \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" by American author Washington Irving. The story, from Irving's collection of short stories entitled The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, has worked itself into known American folklore/legend through literature and film.\n\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a children's novel written by L. Frank Baum and illustrated by W. W. Denslow. Originally published by the George M. Hill Company in Chicago on May 17, 1900, it has since been reprinted numerous times, most often under the name The Wizard of Oz, which is the name of both the 1902 stage play and the well-known adaptation 1939 film version, starring Judy Garland. The story chronicles the adventures of a young girl named Dorothy Gale in the Land of Oz, after being swept away from her Kansas farm home in a tornado. Thanks in part to the 1939 MGM movie, it is one of the best-known stories in American popular culture.\n\nNative Americans were the earliest inhabitants of the land that is today known as the United States and played its first music. Beginning in the 17th century, immigrants from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany and France began arriving in large numbers, bringing with them new styles and instruments. African slaves brought musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributes to a melting pot. Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that.\n\nEarliest American scholars were with The American Folklore Society (AFS), which emerged in the late 1800s. Their studies expanded to include Native American music, but still treated folk music as a historical item preserved in isolated societies. In North America, during the 1930s and 1940s, the Library of Congress worked through the offices of traditional music collectors Robert Winslow Gordon, Alan Lomax and others to capture as much North American field material as possible. Lomax was the first prominent scholar to study distinctly American folk music such as that of cowboys and southern blacks. His first major published work was in 1911, Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads, and was arguably the most prominent US folk music scholar of his time, notably during the beginnings of the folk music revival in the 1930s and early 1940s.\n\nThe American folk music revival was a phenomenon in the United States that began during the 1940s and peaked in popularity in the mid-1960s. Its roots went earlier, and performers like Burl Ives, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, and Oscar Brand had enjoyed a limited general popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. The revival brought forward musical styles that had, in earlier times, contributed to the development of country & western, jazz, and rock and roll music.\n\nSlavery was introduced to the British colonies in the early 17th century. The ancestors of today's African-American population were brought from hundreds of tribes across West Africa, and brought with them certain traits of West African music including call and response vocals and complex rhythmic music, as well as syncopated beats and shifting accents. The African musical focus on rhythmic singing and dancing was brought to the New World, where it became part of a distinct folk culture that helped Africans \"retain continuity with their past through music\". The first slaves in the United States sang work songs, and field hollers.\n\nProtestant hymns written mostly by New England preachers became a feature of camp meetings held among devout Christians across the South. When blacks began singing adapted versions of these hymns, they were called Negro spirituals. It was from these roots, of spiritual songs, work songs and field hollers, that blues, jazz and gospel developed. Negro spirituals were primarily expressions of religious faith.\n\nThe Thirteen Colonies of the original United States were all former British possessions, and Anglo culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements, but with new lyrics, often as parodies of the original material. Anglo-American traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and tall tales, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks and murder.\n\nFolk songs may be classified by subject matter, such as: drinking songs, sporting songs, train songs, work songs, war songs, and ballads.\n\n\nOther American folksongs include: \"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\", \"Skewball\", \"Big Bad John\", \"Stagger Lee\", \"Camptown Races\" and \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\".\n\nWork songs sung by sailors between the 18th and 20th centuries are known as sea shanties. The shanty was a distinct type of work song, developed especially in American-style merchant vessels that had come to prominence in decades prior to the American Civil War. These songs were typically performed while adjusting the rigging, raising anchor, and other tasks where men would need to pull in rhythm. These songs usually have a very punctuated rhythm precisely for this reason, along with a call-and-answer format. Well before the 19th century, sea songs were common on rowing vessels. Such songs were also very rhythmic in order to keep the rowers together.\n\nThey were notably influenced by songs of African Americans, such as those sung whilst manually loading vessels with cotton in ports of the southern United States. The work contexts in which African-Americans sang songs comparable to shanties included: boat-rowing on rivers of the south-eastern U.S. and Caribbean; the work of stokers or \"firemen\", who cast wood into the furnaces of steamboats plying great American rivers;and stevedoring on the U.S. eastern seaboard, the Gulf Coast, and the Caribbean—including \"cotton-screwing\": the loading of ships with cotton in ports of the American South. During the first half of the 19th century, some of the songs African Americans sang also began to appear in use for shipboard tasks, i.e. as shanties.\n\nShanty repertoire borrowed from the contemporary popular music enjoyed by sailors, including minstrel music, popular marches, and land-based folk songs, which were adapted to suit musical forms matching the various labor tasks required to operate a sailing ship. Such tasks, which usually required a coordinated group effort in either a pulling or pushing action, included weighing anchor and setting sail.\n\n\nThe Shakers is a religious sect founded in 18th-century England upon the teachings of Ann Lee. Shakers today are most known for their cultural contributions (especially style of music and furniture). The Shakers composed thousands of songs, and also created many dances; both were an important part of the Shaker worship services. In Shaker society, a spiritual \"gift\" could also be a musical revelation, and they considered it important to record musical inspirations as they occurred. \"Simple Gifts\" was composed by Elder Joseph Brackett and originated in the Alfred Shaker community in Maine in 1848. Aaron Copland's iconic 1944 ballet score Appalachian Spring, uses the now famous Shaker tune \"Simple Gifts\" as the basis of its finale.\n\nFolk dances of British origin include the square dance, descended from the quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers. The religious communal society known as the Shakers emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style.\n\n\nOther locations and landmarks that have become part of American folklore include: Independence Hall, Monument Valley, Ellis Island, Hoover Dam, Pearl Harbor, the Vietnam War Memorial, and the Grand Canyon.\n\n\nOther Cultural Icons include, Rosie the Riveter, the United States Constitution, the Colt Single Action Army, Smokey Bear, the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, Columbia and Apple Pie.\n\nHistorical events that form a part of American folklore include: 9/11, Boston Massacre, Boston Tea Party, Paul Revere's Ride, the Battle of the Alamo, the Salem witch trials, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, California Gold Rush, Battle of the Little Bighorn, the Battle of Gettysburg, the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, and the Attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27808552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27808552", "title": "In a Glass Cage", "text": "In a Glass Cage\n\nIn a Glass Cage () is a 1986 Spanish drama film written and directed by Agustí Villaronga, and starring Günter Meisner, Marisa Paredes and David Sust. Inspired by the history of Gilles de Rais, the plot follows an ex-Nazi child molester who is now paralyzed and depending on an iron lung to live. A young man who comes to nurse him was one of his former victims years before.\n\nDue to themes mixing Nazism, pedophilia, torture and homosexuality, the film was highly controversial. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Teddy Awards, the film was selected to be shown at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2016.\n\nKlaus, a former Nazi doctor, practiced horrific, sadomasochistic experiments on children during World War II. After the war, he goes into exile in a remote village in Catalonia, where he continues to rape and torture young boys. He kills his latest victim with a blow to the head, taking photographs of the crime. Angelo, one of Klaus' victims, spies on him from a window, and steals incriminating writings and photographs of the doctor's crimes. Klaus tries to commit suicide by jumping from a tower. He survives, but he is left paralyzed and unable to breathe on his own, confined permanently in an iron lung to survive. \nSome years later, Klaus is being taken care of by his wife Griselda and their young daughter Rena in a large gloomy house in the country. Griselda is unhappy in Spain and, overwhelmed by the task of looking after her husband, secretly wishes he would just die. Angelo appears, offering his services as a nurse to help take care of Klaus. Griselda takes an instant dislike towards Angelo and does not want to hire him, but Klaus insists that he should stay. In reality, Angelo has no actual nursing skills, which Griselda soon discovers, but even then Klaus refuses to get rid of him. Angelo's true aim is revealed to be not only to take his revenge out on Klaus, but to ultimately take his place as a torturer. Angelo reads Klaus passages from the diaries he stole in which the doctor describes, in detail, how he tortured his victims. Recreating what Klaus did to him, Angelo strips and masturbates in front of Klaus. He then calls Griselda. She tries to run away, but he kills her, hanging her from the rails of the second floor.\n\nThe next day, Angelo fires the housekeeper, taking over the house with Rena's help. Rena is not disturbed by her mother's absence, as Griselda was abusive towards her. Rena feels far more comfortable under Angelo's care. Angelo continues with the doctor's experiments, bringing young boys to Klaus in his iron lung. Angelo lures a child to the house and ties him to a chair. In front of Klaus, Angelo kills the boy by injecting him through the heart with a needle filled with gasoline. He brings in another boy, forces him to sing and kills him by cutting his throat. Fearing that Angelo will kill him and Rena, Klaus tells his daughter to run away to the near village with a message asking for help.\n\nAngelo discovers Rena while she is trying to escape and brings her back to the house. He dominates her, assuming a perverse, violent \"parental\" role. Finally Angelo removes Klaus from his iron lung and lets him die of asphyxiation while emulating the scene of his own abuse, in Rena's presence. Once Klaus is dead, Angelo takes his identity totally, getting into the artificial lung, and makes Rena take his.\n\n\nThe film was the directorial debut of the Spanish filmmaker Agustí Villaronga. Made in 1985, \"In a Glass Cage\" was partially funded by subventions from the ministries of culture both of Spain and of the regional Catalan government. It was distributed by Barcelona based Lauren films. The \"glass cage\" of the film's title refers to the archaic iron lung which has become the home within a home for ex-Nazi Klaus after a suicide attempt. \"In a Glass Cage\" was inspired by the history of Gilles de Rais, a fifteenth-century French nobleman who murdered hundreds of children in sadistic black magic rituals, and was eventually convicted and hanged for his crimes.\n\nIt currently has a 63% \"Fresh\" rating on film review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 5.4/10 based on 8 reviews.\n\n\"In a Glass Cage\" was released on DVD in the United States on 25 May 2004 by Cult Epics. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles. The bonus feature includes a brief interview with director Agustí Villaronga about the making of the film, the origins of the story, the stylistic use of color and location, and the acting. The film made its debut on Blu-ray Disc on November 8, 2011.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5681695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5681695", "title": "Ladies' night", "text": "Ladies' night\n\nA ladies' night is a promotional event, often at a bar or nightclub, where female patrons pay less than male patrons for the cover charge or drinks. In the United States, state courts in California, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have ruled that ladies' night discounts are unlawful gender-based price discrimination under state or local statutes. However, courts in Illinois, Minnesota, and Washington have rejected a variety of challenges to such discounts.\n\nClaims against ladies' nights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution have failed under the state action doctrine. Similar actions have failed under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. § 1983). Ladies' nights may have federal tax implications, though. Federal claims were also involved in the unsuccessful challenge in Washington (\"see below\").\n\nThe California Supreme Court has ruled that ladies' days at a car wash and ladies' nights at a nightclub violate California's Unruh Civil Rights Act in \"Koire v Metro Car Wash\" (1985) and \"Angelucci v. Century Supper Club\" (2007). The Unruh Act provides: \"All persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex [...] are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever [...].\" The court considered the statutory defense that the promotions serve \"substantial business and social purposes\", but concluded that merely being profitable is not a sufficient defense. The court accused the Wisconsin Supreme Court of \"sexual stereotyping\" for upholding a similar practice.\n\nKoire held that: \"Public policy in California strongly supports eradication of discrimination based on sex. The Unruh Act expressly prohibits sex discrimination by business enterprises.\" Koire concluded:\n\nSubsequent to the decision, California passed the Gender Tax Repeal Act of 1995, which specifically prohibits differential pricing based solely on a customer's gender. In Angelucci, the California Supreme Court ruled that discrimination victims did not have to ask the offending business to be treated equally in order to have standing to file an Unruh Act or Gender Tax Repeal Act claim.\n\nCourts have not found violations on the Unruh Act with discounts for which any customer could theoretically qualify for. The California Supreme Court opined:\n\nThe \"Koire\" precedent has not been extended to strike down Mother's Day promotions. \"Koire\" was one of the precedents cited in the lower court (but not the state Supreme Court) in \"In re Marriage Cases\"\n\nLadies' nights in Illinois have been upheld under the anti-discrimination provision of the Dram Shop Act. The court determined that the discount was intended to encourage women to attend the bar in greater numbers, rather than to discourage attendance by males.\n\nMontgomery County's human relations law has been interpreted to not only prohibit ladies' nights, but also a \"Skirt and Gown Night\" where a customer is given a 50% discount for wearing a skirt or gown. The court noted that: \"Against this superficially humorous backdrop, we must decide whether this seemingly innocuous business practice constitutes unlawful discrimination within the meaning of a county ordinance.\" The Montgomery County Code, Human Relations Law, § 27-9, prohibited:\nThe Maryland's appellate court's review was far from \"de novo\" and the court emphasized that:\nThe court also stressed the peculiarity and strictness of the municipal ordinance it was interpreting:\n\nAttempts by municipal governments to prevent ladies' nights have been struck down as \"ultra vires\". In June 2010 the Minnesota Department of Human Rights said bars are discriminating against males by holding \"ladies' night\" promotions, but said it will not seek out bars that have a \"ladies night.\"\n\nIn 2008, the Nevada Equal Rights Commission ruled in favor of a man who claimed a local gym offering free memberships to women was discriminatory. The ruling is thought to have had wide ramifications for ladies' night promotions across the state.\n\nAlthough the question has not been litigated in Nevada courts, two Nevada attorneys advise: \"for the time being, businesses should exercise caution in utilizing gender-based pricing scheme promotions. While the ability of a plaintiff to succeed on such a claim in district court remains unknown, NERC has the ability to pursue such claims on the administrative level. Therefore, businesses should engage in a cost-benefit analysis, keeping in mind that they might have to spend time and resources defending a sex discrimination charge in front of NERC or elsewhere.\"\n\nIn 2004, the director of New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety Division of Civil rights ruled that ladies' night promotions constituted unlawful discrimination in violation of the state's Law Against Discrimination.\n\nThe New York State Human Rights Appeal Board disapproved of a New York Yankees \"Ladies Day\" promotion, which originated in 1876 as being \"in a modern technological society where women and men are to be on equal footing as a matter of public policy.\"\n\nSuch promotions violate the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act as unlawful gender discrimination where male patrons are charged an entrance fee or a greater charge for drinks and female patrons are not charged an identical entrance fee or the same charge for drinks as male patrons. In \"Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Dobrinoff\", the Commonwealth Court specifically found that where a female patron was exempt from a cover charge, a go-go bar engaged in unlawful gender discrimination. The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board has stated as recently as 2009 that it will issue citations against establishments which charge patrons differing amounts based on gender.\n\nLadies' nights have been found not to violate state anti-discrimination law, or the federal constitution, by the Washington Supreme Court, even if held at a stadium owned by a city. The Washington Supreme Court concluded that \"the respondent has shown no discrimination against men as a class and no damage to himself. As a consequence he has no right of action under the state Law Against Discrimination. \" In part, the court emphasized in its ruling evidence presented in the trial court that \"women do not manifest the same interest in basketball that men do,\" and that the discount was only one of many discounts and promotions, the others available regardless of gender. Finally, the majority noted that \"to decide important constitutional questions upon a complaint as sterile as this would be apt to erode public respect for the Equal Rights Amendment and deter rather than promote the serious goals for which it was adopted.\"\n\nThe dissenting justices emphasized their broader interpretation of the applicable prohibition and the potential for such promotions to reinforce stereotypes. One dissenting justice proposed that the complainant be allowed no damages, but only that the practice be enjoined. The dissent concluded:\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court has held that such promotions violate the state's public accommodation law. The court noted that the text and legislative history of the statute permitted no distinction between sex, race, and other forms of discrimination.\n\nAlthough ladies' nights are prohibited by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in the United Kingdom as unlawful discrimination, some clubs reportedly flout the ban.\n\nLadies' nights were deemed unlawful by the Hong Kong District Court.\n"}
{"id": "1361369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1361369", "title": "Language change", "text": "Language change\n\nLanguage change is variation over time in a language's phonological, morphological, semantic, syntactic, and other features. It is studied by historical linguistics and evolutionary linguistics. Some commentators use the label corruption to suggest that language change constitutes a degradation in the quality of a language, especially when the change originates from human error or prescriptively discouraged usage. Descriptive linguistics typically does not support this concept, since from a descriptive point of view such changes are neither good nor bad.\n\n\nAccording to Guy Deutscher, the tricky question is \"Why are changes not brought up short and stopped in their tracks? At first sight, there seem to be all the reasons in the world why society should never let the changes through.\" He sees the reason for tolerating change in the fact that we already are used to \"synchronic variation\", to the extent that we are hardly aware of it. For example, when we hear the word \"wicked\", we automatically interpret it as either \"evil\" or \"wonderful\", depending on whether it is uttered by an elderly lady or a teenager. Deutscher speculates that \"[i]n a hundred years' time, when the original meaning of 'wicked' has all but been forgotten, people may wonder how it was ever possible for a word meaning 'evil' to change its sense to 'wonderful' so quickly.\"\n\nAll languages change continually,\nand do so in many and varied ways.\n\nMarcel Cohen details various types of language change under the overall headings of the external evolution\nand internal evolution of languages.\n\nThe study of lexical changes forms the diachronic portion of the science of onomasiology.\n\nThe ongoing influx of new words into the English language (for example) helps make it a rich field for investigation into language change, despite the difficulty of defining precisely and accurately the vocabulary available to speakers of English. Throughout its history English has not only borrowed words from other languages but has re-combined and recycled them to create new meanings, whilst losing some old words.\n\nDictionary-writers try to keep track of the changes in languages by recording (and, ideally, dating) the appearance in a language of new words, or of new usages for existing words. By the same token, they may tag some words eventually as \"archaic\" or \"obsolete\".\n\nThe concept of sound change covers both phonetic and phonological developments.\n\nThe sociolinguist William Labov recorded the change in pronunciation in a relatively short period in the American resort of Martha's Vineyard and showed how this resulted from social tensions and processes.\nEven in the relatively short time that broadcast media have recorded their work, one can observe the difference between the pronunciation of the newsreaders of the 1940s and the 1950s and the pronunciation of today. The greater acceptance and fashionability of regional accents in media may also reflect a more democratic, less formal society — compare the widespread adoption of language policies.\n\nThe mapping and recording of small-scale phonological changes poses difficulties, especially as the practical technology of sound recording dates only from the 19th century. Written texts provide the main (indirect) evidence of how language sounds have changed over the centuries. But note Ferdinand de Saussure's work on postulating the existence and disappearance of laryngeals in Proto-Indo-European as an example of other methods of detecting/reconstructing sound-changes within historical linguistics. Poetic devices such as rhyme and rhythm may provide clues to previous phonological habits.\n\nStandardisation of spelling originated relatively recently. Differences in spelling often catch the eye of a reader of a text from a previous century. The pre-print era had fewer literate people: languages lacked fixed systems of orthography, and the handwritten manuscripts that survive often show words spelled according to regional pronunciation and to personal preference.\nSemantic changes are shifts in the meanings of existing words. Basic types of semantic change include:\n\nAfter a word enters a language, its meaning can change as through a shift in the valence of its connotations. As an example, when \"villain\" entered English it meant 'peasant' or 'farmhand', but acquired the connotation 'low-born' or 'scoundrel', and today only the negative use survives. Thus 'villain' has undergone pejoration. Conversely, the word \"wicked\" is undergoing amelioration in colloquial contexts, shifting from its original sense of 'evil', to the much more positive one of 'brilliant'.\n\nWords' meanings may also change in terms of the breadth of their semantic domain. Narrowing a word limits its alternative meanings, whereas broadening associates new meanings with it. For example, \"hound\" (Old English \"hund\") once referred to any dog, whereas in modern English it denotes only a particular type of canid. On the other hand, the word \"dog\" has been broadened from its Old English root 'dogge', the name of a particular breed, to become the general term for all canines.\n\nSyntactic change is the evolution of the syntactic structure of a natural language.\n\nOver time, syntactic change is the greatest modifier of a particular language. Massive changes – attributable either to creolization or to relexification – may occur both in syntax and in vocabulary. Syntactic change can also be purely language-internal, whether independent within the syntactic component or the eventual result of phonological or morphological change.\n\nThe sociolinguist Jennifer Coates, following William Labov, describes linguistic change as occurring in the context of linguistic heterogeneity. She explains that \"[l]inguistic change can be said to have taken place when a new linguistic form, used by some sub-group within a speech community, is adopted by other members of that community and accepted as the norm.\"\n\nCan and Patton (2010) provide a quantitative analysis of twentieth century Turkish literature using forty novels of forty authors. Using weighted least squares regression and a sliding window approach, they show that, as time passes, words, in terms of both tokens (in text) and types (in vocabulary), have become longer. They indicate that the increase in word lengths with time can be attributed to the government-initiated language \"reform\" of the 20th century. This reform aimed at replacing foreign words used in Turkish, especially Arabic- and Persian-based words (since they were in majority when the reform was initiated in early 1930s), with newly coined pure Turkish neologisms created by adding suffixes to Turkish word stems (Lewis, 1999).\n\nCan and Patton (2010), based on their observations of the change of a specific word use (more specifically in newer works the preference of \"ama\" over \"fakat\", both borrowed from Arabic and meaning 'but', and their inverse usage correlation is statistically significant), also speculate that the word length increase can influence the common word choice preferences of authors.\n\nAltintas, Can, and Patton (2007) introduce a systematic approach to language change quantification by studying unconsciously-used language features in time-separated parallel translations. For this purpose, they use objective style markers such as vocabulary richness and lengths of words, word stems and suffixes, and employ statistical methods to measure their changes over time.\n\nLanguages perceived to be \"higher status\" stabilise or spread at the expense of other languages perceived by their own speakers to be \"lower-status\".\n\nHistorical examples are the early Welsh and Lutheran Bible translations, leading to the liturgical languages Welsh and High German thriving today, unlike other Celtic or German variants.\n\nFor prehistory, Forster and Renfrew (2011) argue that in some cases there is a correlation of language change with intrusive male Y chromosomes but not with female mtDNA. They then speculate that technological innovation (transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture, or from stone to metal tools) or military prowess (as in the abduction of British women by Vikings to Iceland) causes immigration of at least some males, and perceived status change. Then, in mixed-language marriages with these males, prehistoric women would often have chosen to transmit the \"higher-status\" spouse's language to their children, yielding the language/Y-chromosome correlation seen today.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As seen in the comics, films, video game and the TV series.\n\nWeapons in the \"Men in Black\" films are often depicted as compact, energy-spitting, and silver-colored. Most of their weapons are made concealable so civilians are unable to see them. Many of their technologies are sold and patented to fund their organization.\n\nIn the comics, their main weapons are the same weapons used in the 20th and 21st century, as opposed to the futuristic weapons appearing in the film series.\n\nBy means of concealability, many of their weapons are small. Throughout the movie there is an insistence that small is unimportant, bad, and wimpy. For example, this belief can be seen in Jay's reaction to the noisy cricket, sickly underestimating it and even joking that he may break the \"damn thing\". Yet, as he later found out in the film, the cricket is very dangerous, the kick-back hurling Jay into the display case behind him the first time he shoots it. Despite Jay's skepticism, this was a powerful weapon, just in a small package.\n\nOftentimes, the Men in Black utilizes special gadgets that aids them in battle and investigation. Many of them are made to look like ordinary technology we use today for means of concealability. The first gadget ever used in the franchise was the Neuralyzer, and many soon followed in the television series.\n\n\nMiB agents wear suits as their primary uniform. All their clothes including the jacket, pants, ties, socks and leather shoes are all black, hence the name Men in Black while the dress shirts are white. These suits are worn so that when they \"neuralyze\" a victim, they won't leave any lasting impression or image. These suits were described as \"the last suit [an MiB agent] will ever wear\", and in the films and television series, these suits are always worn and the agents are all seen wearing them at all times. MiB agents also wear specialized Predator 2 Ray-Ban sunglasses to protect them from their own neuralyzer flash. These sunglasses became popular in the franchise, and sales of these glasses in the market increased over time.\n\nIn the films and TV series, the MiB have a wide array of disguises that they, and visiting aliens, wear either for their undercover purposes, or for the aliens hidden in the city. Their main purpose though is to make sure that no civilians will ever know aliens are \"walking among them\", and for the aliens not to spook any civilians.\n\nThere are specialized suits that MiB agents use in field missions and investigations. Hazmat suits are seen in the second film, where the agents wore them when investigating Serleena's spacecraft.\n\n\nVehicles in the Men in Black franchise are also black, simple, and concealable, so as not to attract attention like other MiB technology. These vehicles are often weaponized, and many variants have the ability to fly. Vehicles are also available in the video game MIB: Alien Crisis in the driving missions.\n\n\n"}

The Innamorati of Commedia dell'arte represent this by going unmasked in the midst of the other characters. Often, the lovers are incapable of resolving their own problems. The role of rescuing them is often a tricky slave's place.\n\nWhen the lovers' problems are at least partly internal to them, they have diverged from the stock characters. Florizel and Perdita in \"The Winter's Tale\" are such lovers; Perdita's reluctance to be wooed by a man above her (apparent) birth is a trivial problem beside his father's rage at such a match. But in \"Much Ado About Nothing\", Claudio and Hero's problems arise from Claudio's being gulled, but are not solved until Claudio shakes off the villain's influence, and so he is not the stock character; still less are Benedick and Beatrice these stock characters, where the obstacles to their love are entirely in their characters.\n\nNorthrop Frye considered this plot, with colorless characters and all, a central portion of the myth of spring, comedy.\n\nWhen the romance is not the central plot element, the character with whom the hero or heroine is deepy and truly romantically involved is called the romantic love interest, beloved or sweetheart.\n\n"}

{"id": "23875846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23875846", "title": "Musical cryptogram", "text": "Musical cryptogram\n\nA musical cryptogram is a cryptogrammatic sequence of musical notes, a sequence which can be taken to refer to an extra-musical text by some 'logical' relationship, usually between note names and letters. The most common and best known examples result from composers using ciphered versions of their own or their friends' names as themes or motifs in their compositions. Much rarer is the use of music notation to encode messages for reasons of espionage or personal security called steganography.\n\nBecause of the multitudinous ways in which notes and letters can be related, detecting hidden ciphers and proving accurate decipherment is difficult.\n\nFrom the initial assignment by Western music theorists of letter names to notes in the 9th century it became possible to reverse the procedure and assign notes to the letters of names. However, this does not seem to have become a recognized technique until the Baroque period. From the mid-19th century it has become quite common. Sporadic earlier encipherments used solmization syllables.\n\nIt is believed that this method was first used by Josquin des Prez in his \"Missa Hercules Dux Ferrarie\". It was named Soggetto cavato by the later theorist Zarlino. Under this scheme the vowel sounds in the text are matched to the vowel sounds of the solmization syllables of Guido of Arezzo (where 'ut' is the root, which we now call 'do'). Thus the Latin name of the dedicatee 'Hercules Dux Ferrarie' (Ercole d'Este, Duke of Ferrara) becomes re-ut-re-ut-re-fa-mi-re, which translates as D-C-D-C-D-F-E-D in modern notation with C as 'ut'. This is used as the cantus firmus of the mass setting. Josquin's method was imitated by several of his contemporaries and successors, including Adrian Willaert and Costanzo Festa.\n\nSince the note names only cover letters A to G (reflecting the octave repetition of these names), the problem arises as to how to cipher the rest of the alphabet. Historically there have been two main solutions, which may be labelled for convenience the 'German' and the 'French' methods.\n\nBecause the development of note names took place within the framework of modes, in the German-speaking world \"B-flat\" was named 'B' and \"B-natural\" was named 'H'. The most common musical cryptogram is the B-A-C-H motif, which was used by Johann Sebastian Bach himself, by his contemporaries and by many later composers. Other note names were derived by sound, for example \"E-flat\", 'Es' in German, could represent 'S' and \"A-flat\" the digraph 'As'.\n\nComposers less fortunate than Bach usually seem to have chosen to ignore non-musical letters in generating their motifs. For example, Robert Schumann, an inveterate user of cryptograms, has just S-C-H-A (\"E-flat, C, B-natural, A\") to represent himself in \"Carnaval\". Sometimes phonetic substitution could be used, Schumann representing Bezeth by B-E-S-E-D-H. Johannes Brahms used B-A-H-S (\"B-flat, A, B-natural, E-flat\") for his surname in the A-flat minor organ fugue, and the mixed language Gis-E-La (\"G-sharp, E, A\") for Gisela von Arnim, among many examples.\n\nThe 'French' method of generating cryptograms arose late in the 19th century and was more akin to normal encipherment. The most popular version involved writing out the letters H-N, O-U and V-Z in lines under the original diatonic notes A-G, as follows:\n\nso that A, H, O, and V are enciphered by note 'A', B, I, P and W by 'B' (flat or natural) and so on. This scheme was used by Jules Écorcheville, editor of the journal \"S.I.M.\", to solicit centenary commemorations of Joseph Haydn in 1909, except that he diverted the 'H' to B-natural, presumably to avoid too many repeated notes. Writing to Gabriel Fauré about the invitation, Camille Saint-Saëns said he was writing to Écorcheville asking him to prove that Y and N could signify D and G as \"it would be annoying to get mixed up in a farcical business which would make us a laughing stock in the German musical world.\" \nThe many-to-one mapping of this method makes it more difficult to extract possible motifs from the musical score than the one-to-one correspondence (apart from 'As') of the German system.\n\nA French tradition of celebratory uses developed from the Haydn centenary, with tributes to \nGabriel Fauré by Maurice Ravel, Florent Schmitt, Charles Koechlin and others in 1922 (added to later by Arnold Bax, 1949) and to Albert Roussel by Francis Poulenc, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud and others (using various ciphering schemes) in 1929. Honegger's system involved placing the letters after 'H' under sharpened and flattened notes, an example of how chromatic cryptograms could be more easily accommodated in 20th-century music.\n\nOlivier Messiaen developed his own full cipher, involving pitches and note lengths, for his organ work \"Méditations sur le mystère de la Sainte Trinité\" (1969).\n\nDmitri Shostakovich used the German scheme for his personal motto D-Es-C-H (\"D, E-flat, C, B-natural\"), representing D.SCH, which appears in many of his most characteristic works. Elliott Carter featured both a cryptogram for the last name \"Boulez\" in his piece \"Réflexions\" (2004) and a sonic symbol of the first name \"Pierre\".\n\nCryptograms were less common in England, but Edward Elgar, who was also interested in general cryptography and puzzles, wrote an early \"Allegretto\" for his pupils the Gedge sisters using G-E-D-G-E and part of the 'enigma' in the \"Enigma Variations\" involves cryptograms.\n\nIn 1947 Friedrich Smend also been suggested that Bach enciphered significant numbers through methods including repetitions of a motif, word, or phrase; the notes played on the continuo; the use of sequence; and the notes played by the accompaniment. However, Ruth Tatlow has presented evidence questioning the plausibility of Smend's claims.\n\nDuring the first quarter of the 20th century, American author and occultist Paul Foster Case established an esoteric musical cryptogram for the purposes of ceremonial magick. The system was a derivative of a cipher used by an affiliated magical order called the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Each note of the 12 tone system was assigned a set of correspondences including colors, planets, zodiacal signs, and Hebrew letters. The holy names of biblical characters were translated letter by letter into a linear sequence of musical notes, so that each letter could be sung by the congregation in unison.\n\nEzra Sandzer-Bell has written and published two books on this subject, describing how Paul Foster Case's system of musical cryptography could be applied to songwriting. Any word can be translated phonetically into Hebrew and converted using Case's cryptogram to generate a series of notes. Sandzer-Bell's project involves the conversion of the common and Latin names of plants, trees, and mushrooms into melodies. Each song was composed by consuming the plant in tea or tincture form, then using the physical effects of the plant to determine what kind of rhythm, harmony, instruments, and dynamics to use. A lengthy demonstration and proof concept is publicly available on the author's website.\n\nThe following list includes only motifs which are known to have been used in published works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Among the unusual properties of Nth metal is the ability to negate gravity, allowing a person wearing an object made of Nth metal, such as a belt, to fly. In addition, Nth metal also protects the wearer from the elements and speeds the healing of wounds, increases their strength, and protects them from extremes in temperature. It has many other properties that have yet to be revealed in full. It has been implied that the apparently \"magical\" abilities of the Thanagarian supervillain, Onimar Synn, all stem from his unique mastery of the properties of Nth metal. These powers are augmented to a god-like level during the war when he builds himself an artificial body made of the substance.\n\nIn ancient Egypt a Thanagarian spaceship made of Nth metal crash-landed, only to be discovered by Prince Khufu and his betrothed, Chay-ara. Constant exposure to Nth metal forced Khufu and Chay-ara into a cycle of reincarnation. In the 20th century, they were incarnated as Carter Hall and Shiera Saunders, the original Hawkman and Hawkgirl. As Hawkman and Hawkgirl, they wore Nth metal belts, made with the help of the Thanagarian Paran Katar, father of Katar Hol, when he was visiting Earth.\n\nMany years later, Carter and Shiera's son, Hector Hall, made a suit of armor made of Nth metal and took the name Silver Scarab as a founding member of Infinity Inc. The suit provided him with protection from attacks, let him lift great weights, and allowed him to fly and project solar energy blasts.\n\nThe current Hawkman and Hawkgirl continue to wear Nth metal.\n\nMuch later in the DC timeline, members of the Legion of Super Heroes wear \"flight rings\" made of an alloy of Nth metal called valorium.\n\nThe mercenary known as Deathstroke wears armor made of a composite Nth metal blend.\n\nIts name is derived from the idiom \"The Nth Degree\" meaning that something is raised to a very high level, in this case the metal's overall numerous unusual properties and atomic number.\n\nWithin the recent rebooted continuum, Nth Metal takes on many attributes of other media while retaining unique qualities all its own. The metal is now mystical in nature, sharing a symbiotic link when it bonds with a proper host giving them numerous biophysical augmentations like in previous publishing.\n\nIt grants its user augmented physical capabilities while physically bonding to them as was the case with Katar Hol, it even has regenerative and restorative abilities far greater than in past serializations.\n\nEven being able to restore long lost physical attributes like a Thanagarian's genetically stunted wingspan. The metal is metamorphic and can change, shift and fabricate shielding or armaments on command. The healing properties present within are so potent they can even revive the recently deceased. Nth metal will move and act however the wielder sees fit but can also work on its own protecting its host from certain attacks.\n\nNth Metal has various other properties making it useful for combat or support. Namely it is adaptive and can develop new abilities when the user needs it such as nullifying another's regenerative abilities allowing for an opening to deliver fatal blows, said metal can also interact with and undo supernatural entities like ghosts and apparitions like in the cartoon.\n\nIn Despero's case he used the metal to augment his already considerable psionic and physical capabilities several fold. As wondrous as the materia is, all of its functions are stunted if and when mixed with other metals. Only affording the user vastly augmented strength and physical ability, beyond that its merely tougher than even a titanium steel armor plating mesh.\n\nNth metal, like the mysterious Element X, is a materia of the DC Multiverse. Despite its malleability it has incredible tensile strength to make a fabrication of it next to invincible. The Eschaton Golem's created by Zonuz; Old God of evil, were built using Nth Metal to hunt down and slay his progeny in The New Gods. Through it, they had the power to tap into the metaphysical forces of reality itself; able to emit destructive force blasts that could level cities and planets, project life restoring energies which could free those trapped even from within the Source Wall and their greatest effective function was a facsimile of the Omega Beam used by Darkseid. Which is able to snipe and track their intended targets across universal to pandimensional distances at a time.\n\nIn DC Comics Rebirth, Nth Metal first reappeared in Dark Days: The Forge. \nIt is revealed in #1 that all Nth metal present on Earth was destroyed by Kendra Saunders, the only piece left was in her possession until Batman stole it.\nThe Nth metal is revealed to be a part of a process called mantling, in which a hero is touched by five divine metals that can create a doorway to the dark multiverse. During the Dark Nights event, Batman becomes a part of this process resulting in him exchanging places with seven dark versions of himself from the dark multiverse.\nIt is later revealed that Nth Metal is a counter vibratory material that cancels out the frequencies of Dark Multiverse denizens, as was the case with a twisted mirror inversion of Damian Wayne under the Bat Who Laughs, making it the most effective weapon against Barbartos and his seven dark anagrams of Batman.\n\nHawkgirl and Hawkman's origin in Rebirth is still linked to Nth Metal.\n\nIn the \"Justice League\" animated series, Nth metal has a somewhat different history. Nth metal is transuranic iron with an atomic number of 676, possesses innate anti-magical properties, is hyperconductive and is able to invert mesons and gravitons.\n\nThe Thanagarians had used the Nth metal to drive off Ichthulthu, a Lovecraftian entity that had dominated Thanagar for generations. Also, Hawkgirl was able to use her Nth metal mace to deflect the spells of Doctor Fate, and her mace was the only weapon that could put down a rampaging Solomon Grundy that was under the influence of chaos magic.\n\nHawkman, who appears later in the DCAU, also carries an axe and a net made out of Nth metal. He uses the net to capture Gentleman Ghost, claiming that the properties of Nth metal interfere with dimensional shifting.\n\nIn \"The Batman\", Nth metal is renamed \"Nth Element\" and is portrayed as an alien mineral found within meteors. The mineral causes whatever is irradiated with it to float and defy gravity, like in the comics. The Nth Element is used in Hawkman's equipment, and Black Mask attempts to use it for a bank heist.\n\nIn \"\", Batman uses Nth metal brass knuckles, handcuffs, as well as batarangs, to fight and capture Gentleman Ghost. Green Arrow is shown to have Nth metal tipped arrows. As shown in the animated \"Justice League\", Nth metal can be used against supernatural beings, but is vulnerable to direct magical spells, as is seen when Equinox mystically melts Batman's Nth metal handcuffs.\n\nIn \"The Flash\" episode, \"Legends of Today,\" Vandal Savage obtains the Staff of Horus, which is made from a strange, otherworldly material, which Cisco Ramon calls an \"Nth metal,\" and starts developing gloves that can counteract the Staff's energy.\n\nIn the \"Arrow\" episode, \"Legends of Yesterday,\" after Vandal Savage kills Prince Khufu and Priestess Chay-Ara, a meteor storm of Nth metal meteors rain down on Egypt, granting Hath-Set immortality and Khufu and Chay-Ara the power of reincarnation. When their first attempt to stop Savage fails, The Flash runs back in time and helps Cisco improve the gloves to counteract Savage's staff. After they defeat Savage, Cisco makes a distress communicator out of Nth metal for Kendra and Carter.\n\nIn the \"Legends of Tomorrow\" episode, \"Night of the Hawk,\" a strange meteor made of Nth metal crashes down in Harmony Falls, Oregon in 1958, which Vandal Savage recovers. At the crash site, he also finds a group of teenagers that crashed and captures them, where he experiments on them at a mental hospital with the Nth metal and transforms them into Hawk-like creatures, along with the various other victims he's captured. Jefferson \"Jax\" Jackson is then captured and sent to the mental hospital, where Vandal injects him with a serum made from the Nth metal that transforms him into a Hawk creature. Later, after the team manages to stop Savage, Professor Martin Stein and Gideon are able to create a serum to counteract the Nth metal's effects and cure Jax and the other victims.\n\nIn the \"Supergirl\" episode, \"The Darkest Place\", Supergirl and Mon-El were captured by Project Cadmus and imprisoned in cages made from Nth metal. When Supergirl attempts to break the Nth metal cages, Mon-El claims that \"they're unbreakable\", and mentions that this material is from Thanagar.\n\nIn the video game \"Injustice 2\", certain pieces of customizable equipment are made of or reference Nth Metal. Additionally, certain characters have Nth Metal skins which can be unlocked giving the character's equipment and certain portions of their clothing a metallic appearance. Also, Donatello mentions that he has outfitted his new Bo staff with an Nth Metal core when facing Hal Jordan.\n\n"}

In so doing, Federal departments and agencies can be more transparent with the work they do. Software can eventually be streamlined across all agencies, and people can begin to make suggestions on how to improve the code and policy these departments work on. The belief that citizens should have this information available and open to them, is the idea behind what the Obama administration coined as the, \"People's Code.\" \n\nThe People's Code is a project informed by the United States Federal Source Code Policy. In August 2016, the People's Code served as a deliverable of President Obama's 2013 promise to enforce open data initiatives, and pursue aspirations for a modernized digital governance for the United States. \n\nEmploying this OSS model allows for a cost-efficient means of releasing platforms and projects, whereby individual code does not need to be written for each of the respective plans or platforms respective departments are embarking on. This model also enables a system for best practices to be streamlined across participating Federal agencies. This means if one code proves to be successful in a particular department, another department would be able to apply and modify this same code to meet their own specific requirements, until eventually, the best tools and services of practice are implemented across the board. \n\nPrevious Open Data action plans to release government data and statistics are said to be complemented through the implementation of this policy plan. This is because this policy plan can promote collaborative exchange between governments, and citizens. Civic engagement and participation could then be increased, and the deliverance of government services can be improved through collective efforts. \n\nIn addition to economic and service efficiencies, this policy meets open government objectives for openness as well, for its proactive transparency in program and service implementation. Federal agencies and extendedly, the government as a whole is achieving more openness for actively releasing its coding and inviting the public to engage with it. \n\nSome criticisms against this specific point on open governance have been raised. The independent agency of the, General Services Administration has said that Obama's initial plans for a pilot version of this program were insufficient. This agency instead made a suggestion for an initiative which would proactively disclose all code, rather than successfully meet a minimum specified amount. Another criticism against this concept of open government planning was that the release of code and software from specific agencies could have the potential to lead to vulnerabilities for the government, (such as terrorism), as a result of being too transparent. Similarly to this, federal agencies who have contracted their code programming out to third parties do not have to follow the same requirements set out by this policy. This could mean code for certain programs and agencies may never become open source. The subsequent change of government has from President Obama to Trump has led for this policy to be archived on the official White House government website. Activists for OSS have also explained the future of this policy is hard to discern under Trump, who has made orders which stifle the potential for innovations through open source. Open source thrives through collaboration and innovation of diverse communities in America. These communities have had difficulty following more strict immigration restrictions since Trump's presidency, which also threatens the future of open source cooperation, prompting members of this community, like Jim Zemlin, to speak out. \n\nIn line with Sections 7.2, 7.3 and Section 7.6 of the Federal Source Code Policy, the code.gov site where government data and code is published on OSS platform, GitHub. This site acts a repository for federal code to be examined by citizens who can access these data and see what federal agencies use to run their programs and projects. Citizens and other GitHub users can also use this same forum to send in their policy and code suggestions. These suggestions and flags for bug fixes are then reviewed, and can subsequently be approved on a case by case basis prior to implementation. \n\nThere are currently nearly 30 participating Federal agencies, and thousands of individual projects which are employing the OSS model, and emphasizing the concept that their work and these data are the \"People's\" Code. \n"}
{"id": "1263147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1263147", "title": "Pluricentric language", "text": "Pluricentric language\n\nA pluricentric language or polycentric language is a language with several interacting codified standard versions, often corresponding to different countries.\nExamples include English, French, Portuguese, German, Korean, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Swedish, Armenian and Chinese.\nA language that has only one formally standardized version is monocentric. Examples include Russian and Japanese.\n\nIn some cases the different standards of a pluricentric language may be elaborated until they become autonomous languages, as happened with Malaysian and Indonesian or Hindi and Urdu.\nThe same process is underway in Serbo-Croatian.\n\nPre-Islamic Arabic can be considered a polycentric language. In Arabic-speaking countries different levels of polycentricity can be detected.\nModern Arabic is a pluricentric language with varying branches correlating with different regions where Arabic is spoken and the type of communities speaking it. The vernacular varieties of Arabic include Gulf Arabic (spoken in the Persian Gulf kingdoms of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait), Iraqi Arabic, Levantine Arabic (spoken in Levantine countries of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine), Egyptian Arabic, Sudanese Arabic, and Maghrebi Arabic (spoken in Northwestern Africa), among many others. In addition, many speakers use Modern Standard Arabic in education and formal settings. Therefore, in Arabic-speaking communities, diglossia is frequent.\n\nThe Aramaic language is a pluricentric language, having many different literary standards, including Syriac language, Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, Samaritan Aramaic language, and Mandaic language, and vernacular varieties of Neo-Aramaic languages like Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Bohtan Neo-Aramaic, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, Hértevin language, Koy Sanjaq Syriac language, Senaya language), Western Neo-Aramaic, Northeastern Neo-Aramaic, Central Neo-Aramaic (Mlahsô language, Turoyo language), Neo-Mandaic, Hulaulá language, Lishana Deni, Lishanid Noshan, Lishán Didán, Betanure Jewish Neo-Aramaic, and Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic.\n\nThe Armenian language is a pluricentric language with the liturgical Classical Armenian and two vernacular standards, Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian.\n\nThe term \"Catalan–Valencian–Balearic\" is seldom used (for example, in a dictionary by Antoni Maria Alcover i Sureda).\n\nThis language is internationally known as Catalan, as in Ethnologue. This is also the most commonly used name in Catalonia, but also in Andorra and the Balearic Islands, probably due to the prestige of the Central Catalan dialect spoken in and around Barcelona. However, in the Valencian Community, the official name of this language is Valencian. One reason for this is political (see Serbo-Croatian for a similar situation), but this variant does have its own literary tradition that dates back to the Reconquista.\n\nAlthough mutually intelligible with other varieties of Catalan, Valencian has lexical peculiarities and its own spelling rules, which are set out by the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua, created in 1998. However, this institution recognizes that Catalan and Valencian are varieties of the same language. For their part, there are specific varieties in the two major Balearic islands, Mallorcan (mallorquí) in Mallorca, Menorcan (menorquí) in Menorca. The University of the Balearic Islands is the language regulator for these varieties.\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, most Chinese people spoke only their local varieties of Chinese.\nThese varieties had diverged widely from the written form used by scholars, Literary Chinese, which was modelled on the language of the Chinese classics.\nAs a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on northern varieties, known as \"Guānhuà\" (官話, literally \"speech of officials\"), known as \"Mandarin\" in English after the officials.\nKnowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Literary Chinese was replaced as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects.\nIn the 1930s a standard national language \"Guóyǔ\" (國語, literally \"national language\") was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect, but with vocabulary also drawn from other northern varieties.\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the standard was known as \"Pǔtōnghuà\" (普通话/普通話, literally \"common speech\"), but was defined in the same way as \"Guóyǔ\" in the Republic of China now governing Taiwan. It also became one of the official languages of Singapore, under the name \"Huáyǔ\" (华语/華語, literally \"Chinese language\").\n\nAlthough the three standards remain close, they have diverged to some extent. Most Chinese in Taiwan and Singapore came from the southeast coast of China, where the local dialects lack the retroflex initials /tʂ tʂʰ ʂ/ found in northern dialects, so that many speakers in those places do not distinguish them from the apical sibilants /ts tsʰ s/. Similarly, retroflex codas (\"erhua\") are typically avoided in Taiwan and Singapore. There are also differences in vocabulary, with Taiwanese Mandarin including loanwords from Min Chinese and Japanese, and Singaporean Mandarin borrowing words from English, Malay, Min and other southern Chinese varieties.\n\nThe Coptic language was pluricentric with different written dialects like Sahidic and Bohairic.\n\nEnglish is a pluricentric language, with differences in pronunciation, vocabulary, spelling, etc., between the United Kingdom, North America, Ireland, English-speaking African countries, Singapore, India, and Oceania. Educated native English speakers using their version of one of the standard forms of English are almost completely mutually intelligible, but non-standard forms present significant dialectal variations, and are marked by reduced intelligibility. English is usually considered a symmetric case of a pluricentric language, because there is no clear cultural dominance of one variety over others.\n\nStatistically, however, American English speakers constitute more than 66% of native English speakers, with British English next with about 18% and other varieties such as Australian English and Canadian English having up to 7% each. Due to globalization in recent decades, English is becoming increasingly decentralized, with daily use and statewide study of the language in schools growing in most regions of the world.\n\nBritish and American English are the two most commonly taught varieties in the education systems where English is taught as a second language. British English tends to predominate in former colonies where English is not the first language of the majority of the population, such as Malaysia, India, Pakistan, and Singapore. British English is also the primary form taught in the European Union and the rest of Europe. American English, in contrast, tends to dominate instruction in Latin America, Korea, Taiwan, China and Japan.\n\nPhilippine English (which is predominantly spoken as a second language) has been primarily influenced by American English. The rise of the call center industry in the Philippines has encouraged some Filipinos to \"polish\" or neutralize their accents to make them more closely resemble the accents of their client countries.\n\nCountries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Canada have their own well-established varieties of English which are the standard within those countries but are far more rarely taught overseas to second language learners. The features, especially pronunciation, of the standard dialects of Australia and New Zealand resemble that of British English, while Canadian English more resembles American.\n\nEnglish was historically pluricentric when it was used across the independent kingdoms of England and Scotland prior to the Acts of Union in 1707. English English and Scottish English are now subsections of British English.\n\nIn the modern era, there are several major loci of the French language, including Parisian French (also known as Standard French), North American French and African French.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, the French language was highly variable in pronunciation and vocabulary within France, with varying dialects and degrees of intelligibility, the langues d'oïl. However, government policy made it so that the dialect of Paris would be the method of instruction in schools, and other dialects, like Norman, which has influence from Scandinavian languages, were neglected. Controversy still remains in France over the fact that the government recognizes them as languages of France, but provides no monetary support for them nor has the Constitutional Council of France ratified the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.\n\nNorth American French is the result of French colonization of the New World between the 17th and 18th centuries. In many cases, it contains vocabulary and dialectal quirks not found in Standard Parisian French owing to history: most of the original settlers of Quebec, Acadia, and later what would become Louisiana and northern New England came from Northern and Northwest France, and would have spoken dialects like Norman, Poitevin, and Angevin with far fewer speaking the dialect of Paris. This, plus isolation from developments in France, most notably the drive for standardization by L'Académie française, make North American dialects of the language quite distinct. Acadian French, that which is spoken in New Brunswick, Canada, contains many vocabulary words that are much older than anything found in modern France, much of it having roots in the 17th century, and a distinct intonation. Québécois, the largest of the dialects, has a distinct pronunciation that is not found in Europe in any measure and a greater difference in vowel pronunciation, and syntax tends to vary greatly. Cajun French has some distinctions not found in Canada in that there is more vocabulary derived from both local Native American and African dialects and a pronunciation of the letter r that has disappeared in France entirely. It is rolled, and with heavier contact with the English language than any of the above the pronunciation has shifted to harder sounding consonants in the 20th century. Cajun French equally has been an oral language for generations and it is only recently that its syntax and features been adapted to French orthography.\n\nMinor standards can also be found in Belgium and Switzerland, with a particular influence of Germanic languages on grammar and vocabulary, sometimes through the influence of local dialects. In Belgium, for example, various Germanic influences in spoken French are evident in Wallonia (for example, to \"blink\" in English, and \"blinken\" in German and Dutch, \"blinquer\" in Walloon and local French, \"cligner\" in standard French). \"Ring\" (\"rocade\" or \"périphérique\" in standard French) is a common word in the three national languages for beltway or ring road. Also, in Belgium and Switzerland, there are noted differences in the number system when compared to standard Parisian or Canadian French, notably in the use of \"septante\", \"octante/huitante\" and \"nonante\" for the numbers \"seventy\", \"eighty\", and \"ninety\". In other standards of French, these numbers are usually denoted \"soixante-dix\" (sixty-ten), \"quatre-vingts\" (four-twenties) and \"quatre-vingt-dix\" (four-twenties-and-ten).\nFrench varieties spoken in Oceania are also influenced by local languages. New Caledonian French is influenced by Kanak languages in its vocabulary and grammatical structure.\nAfrican French is another variety.\n\nStandard German is often considered an asymmetric pluricentric language; the standard used in Germany is often considered dominant, mostly because of the sheer number of its speakers and their frequent lack of awareness of the Austrian Standard German and Swiss Standard German varieties. Although there is a uniform stage pronunciation based on a manual by Theodor Siebs that is used in theatres, and, nowadays to a lesser extent, in radio and television news all across German-speaking countries, this is not true for the standards applied at public occasions in Austria, South Tyrol and Switzerland, which differ in pronunciation, vocabulary, and sometimes even grammar. In Switzerland, the letter ß has been removed from the alphabet, with \"ss\" as its replacement. Sometimes this even applies to news broadcasts in Bavaria, a German state with a strong separate cultural identity. The varieties of Standard German used in those regions are to some degree influenced by the respective dialects (but by no means identical to them), by specific cultural traditions (e.g. in culinary vocabulary, which differs markedly across the German-speaking area of Europe), and by different terminology employed in law and administration. A list of Austrian terms for certain food items has even been incorporated into EU law, even though it is clearly incomplete.\n\nThe Hindi languages are a large dialect continuum defined as a unit culturally. The medieval Hindustani was based on a register of Delhi's Khariboli dialect and has two modern standard forms, Standard Hindi and Standard Urdu. Additionally, there are historical literary standards, such as the closely related Braj Bhasha and the more distant Awadhi, as well as recently established standard languages based on what were once considered Hindi dialects: Maithili and Dogri. Other varieties, such as Rajasthani, are often considered distinct languages but have no standard form. Caribbean Hindi and Fijian Hindi also differ significantly from the Sanskritized standard Hindi spoken in India.\n\nThe Malayalam language is a pluricentric language with historically more than one written form. Although modern Malayalam script (also known as Aryanezhuthu) is officially recognized, there are other standardized varieties such as Arabi Malayalam of Mappila Muslims, Karshoni of Saint Thomas Christians and Judeo-Malayalam of Cochin Jews.\n\nThe Persian language has three standardized varieties with official status in Iran, Afghanistan (officially named Dari) and Tajikistan (officially named Tajik). The standard dialect of Iran is based on Tehrani dialect, the standard dialect of Dari based on Kabuli dialect, and the standard dialect of Tajik based on Dushanbe dialect. Iranian Persian and Afghan Persian equally utilize the Perso-Arabic script in writing. Tajik Persian as used in Tajikistan utilizes a modified form of the Cyrillic alphabet, although attempts at re-introducing Perso-Arabic script are being made.\n\nApart from the Galician question, Portuguese varies mainly between Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese. Both varieties have undergone significant and divergent developments in phonology and the grammar of their pronominal systems. The result is that communication between the two varieties of the language without previous exposure can be occasionally difficult.\n\nBrazilian and European Portuguese currently have two distinct, albeit similar, spelling standards. A unified orthography for the two varieties (including a limited number of words with dual spelling) has been approved by the national legislatures of Brazil and Portugal and is now official; see Spelling reforms of Portuguese for additional details. Formal written standards remain grammatically close to each other, despite some minor syntactic differences.\n\nAfrican Portuguese and Asian Portuguese are based on the standard European dialect, but have undergone their own phonetic and grammatical developments, sometimes reminiscent of the spoken Brazilian variant.\n\nSerbo-Croatian is a pluricentric language, with four standard variants (Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian) spoken in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia. These variants do differ slightly, as is the case with other pluricentric languages (English, Spanish, German and Portuguese, among others), but not to a degree that would justify considering them as different languages. The differences between the variants do not undermine the integrity of the system as a whole and do not hinder mutual intelligibility.\n\nSpanish has both national and regional linguistic norms, but all varieties are mutually intelligible (outside of minor vocabulary differences) and the same orthographic rules are shared throughout. In Spain, Standard Spanish is based upon the speech of educated speakers from Madrid. In Argentina and Uruguay the Spanish standard is based on the local dialects of Buenos Aires and Montevideo. This is known as Rioplatense Spanish, distinguishable from other standard Spanish dialects by the greater use of the voseo. Standard Canarian Spanish and all Standard American Spanish dialects (both Latin America and United States) are closely related to Andalusian Spanish. In Colombia, the dialect of Bogotá (\"Rolo\") is valued for its clear pronunciation. The two countries with the largest number of Spanish speakers are Mexico and the United States, making Mexican Spanish the Spanish variety with most speakers. The Spanish of US Latinos is having a widespread influence on Spanish across the globe through music, culture and television produced using the language of the largely bilingual speech community of US Latinos.\n\nTwo varieties exist, though only one written standard remains (regulated by the Swedish Academy of Sweden): \"Rikssvenska\" (literally \"Realm Swedish\"), the official language of Sweden, and \"Finlandssvenska\" (in Finland known as \"Högsvenska\"), which, alongside Finnish, is the other official language of Finland. There are differences in vocabulary and grammar, with the variety used in Finland remaining a little more conservative. The most marked differences are in pronunciation and intonation: Whereas Swedish speakers usually pronounce before front vowels as , this sound is usually pronounced by a Swedo-Finn as ; in addition, the two tones that are characteristic of Swedish (and Norwegian) are absent from most Finnish dialects of Swedish, which have an intonation reminiscent of Finnish and thus sound more monotonous when compared to \"Rikssvenska\".\n\nThere are dialects that could be considered different languages due to long periods of isolation and geographical separation from the central dialects of Svealand and Götaland that came to constitute the base for the standard \"Rikssvenska\". Dialects such as Elfdalian, Jamtlandic, Westrobothnian and Gutnish all differ as much, or more, from standard Swedish than the standard varieties of Danish. Some of them have a standardized orthography, but the Swedish government has not granted any of them official recognition as regional languages and continues to look upon them as dialects of Swedish. Most of them are severely endangered and spoken by elderly people in the countryside. In the case of Westrobothnian the pejorative \"bondska\" is widespread, derived from the word for peasant, thus leading people to believe that it has something to do with peasantry or farming although the dialects have been spoken in all parts of society for over 1000 years.\n\nSome Swedish dialects spoken along the coast of Finnish Ostrobothnia could be considered languages different from standard Swedish because they are developments of Old Norse that historically have had very little influence from standard Swedish.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15870253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15870253", "title": "Professional learning community", "text": "Professional learning community\n\nA professional learning community (PLC) is a method to foster collaborative learning among colleagues within a particular work environment or field. It is often used in schools as a way to organize teachers into working groups of practice-based professional learning.\n\nThe phrase \"professional learning community\" began to be used in the 1990s after Peter Senge's book \"The Fifth Discipline\" (1990) had popularized the idea of learning organizations, related to the idea of reflective practice espoused by Donald Schön in books such as \"The Reflective Turn: Case Studies in and on Educational Practice\" (1991). Charles B. Myers and Lynn K. Myers used the phrase \"professional learning community\" in relation to schools in their 1995 book \"The Professional Educator: A New Introduction to Teaching and Schools\", and a year later Charles B. Myers presented a paper at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association titled \"Beyond the PDS: Schools as Professional Learning Communities\" that proposed a path from professional development school (PDS) efforts to schools as professional learning communities. In 1997, Shirley M. Hord issued a white paper titled \"Professional Learning Communities: Communities of Continuous Inquiry and Improvement\". A year later, Richard DuFour and Robert E. Eaker published the book \"Professional Learning Communities at Work\". Since the late 1990s, a large literature on PLCs has been published.\n\nPLCs have many variations. In Shirley M. Hord's 1997 definition, it means \"extending classroom practice into the community; bringing community personnel into the school to enhance the curriculum and learning tasks for students; or engaging students, teachers, and administrators simultaneously in learning\". Hord noted that the benefits of professional learning community to educators and students include reduced isolation of teachers, better informed and committed teachers, and academic gains for students. In 1998, Richard DuFour and Robert E. Eaker explained:\n\nIn 2004, DuFour stated that initiating and sustaining a PLC \"requires the school staff to focus on learning rather than teaching, work collaboratively on matters related to learning, and hold itself accountable for the kind of results that fuel continual improvement\". In 2005, the Ontario Ministry of Education defined a PLC as \"a shared vision for running a school in which everyone can make a contribution, and staff are encouraged to collectively undertake activities and reflection in order to constantly improve their students' performance\".\n\nMichael Fullan has noted that \"in the spread of PLCs, we have found that the term travels a lot faster than the concept, a finding common to all innovations. The concept is deep and requires careful and persistent attention in thorough learning by reflective doing and problem solving.\" Fullan also noted: \"Transforming the \"culture\" of schools and the systems within which they operate is the main point. It is not an innovation to be implemented, but rather a new culture to be developed.\"\n\nThere are many core characteristics of PLCs including collective teamwork in which leadership and responsibility for student learning are extensively shared, a focus on reflective inquiry and dialogue among educators, collective emphasis on improving student learning, shared values and norms, and development of common practices and feedback.\n\nThe 2005 report by the Ontario Ministry of Education titled \"Education for All\" indicates the characteristics of PLCs are as follows:\n\n\nAround the time that the term \"professional learning community\" was coined, a group of education researchers became interested in the similar idea of \"professional community\" in schools. Based on data they collected in their research for the Center on Organization and Restructuring of Schools, Sharon Kruse, Karen Seashore Louis, and Anthony Bryk developed a three-part framework to describe the critical elements and supportive conditions that are necessary to establish a healthy \"professional\" culture. The components of this framework are described in the following table. Kruse and colleagues found that \"in schools where professional community is strong, teachers work together more effectively, and put more efforts into creating and sustaining opportunities for student learning.\" They also suggested that the social and human resources are more important than the structural conditions in the development of professional community.\n\nIn their 2015 examination of middle school mathematics teachers' collaborative conversations regarding student data, Jason Brasel, Brette Garner, Britnie Kane and Ilana Horn found that the teachers used data to answer four questions:\n\nThe matrix in the following table shows how Brasel and colleagues found that the teachers combined these four questions to learn about two dimensions of teaching: student thinking and instruction. The authors found that while the most productive collaborative discussions—that allowed the teachers to learn more about mathematics content, students and pedagogy—focused more on \"why\" and \"how\", the teachers tended to address only the first two questions, \"what\" and to \"whom\". While these conversations were helpful in identifying students in need of remediation, they did little in the way to improve instruction in the long run.\n\nTeachers and other educators can feel as if they are pawns in a larger game of chess where school and district leaders are making decisions that cause problems for educators trying to do their jobs. Barriers that can inhibit the development of PLCs include subject areas, because some educational subjects tend to naturally take precedence over others. The physical layout of the school can be another obstacle.\n\nIn the book \"Intentional Interruption: Breaking Down Learning Barriers to Professional Practice\", Steven Katz and Lisa Ain Dack identified six mental barriers to learning in PLCs: \"we don't think through all possibilities; we focus on confirming our hypotheses and not challenging them; we pay too much attention to things that are vivid; we consider ourselves to be exceptions; we hesitate to take action in a new direction; we don't want others to see our vulnerabilities\". Katz and Dack opt for a psychological definition of learning: \"Learning is the process through which experience causes permanent change in knowledge or behaviour\". It is the characteristic of permanence which raises the bar for all professional learning, because learning as permanent change is not easy or natural to achieve. Katz and Dack urge designers of professional learning to avoid the \"activity trap\" of assuming that participation in a protocol or process guarantees real learning has occurred or putting so much emphasis on the activity that learning is lost in the shuffle.\n\nBecause of these difficulties many teachers are turning to the web for PLCs. Teachers are finding groups through Twitter, Facebook, and other social media websites that allow them to interact with teachers from across their country to brainstorm and exchange ideas. These groups can be helpful for those with PLCs already at their current school and those without PLCs.\n\nA PLC can be seen as an effective staff development team approach and a strategy for school improvement. The PLC process aims to be a reflective process where both individual and community growth is achieved, connected with the school's shared vision for learning. In his book \"The Fifth Discipline\", Peter Senge commented on the importance of building shared vision:\n\nCreation of a shared vision involves sharing diverse ideas and making compromises so that all members are satisfied with the direction in which the organization is moving. Conflicting goals can become a source of positive development: \"Top-down mandates and bottom-up energies need each other\".\n\nThrough this commitment and creation of a shared vision the team may become empowered to work together and achieve goals. As teachers' capacity increases and they develop a sense of professional growth, they may find they are able to reach goals they could not reach on their own.\n\nIn an educational setting, a PLC may include people from multiple levels of the organization who are collaboratively and continually working together for the betterment of the organization. Peter Senge believes \"it is no longer sufficient to have one person learning for the organization\". A major principle of PLCs is that people learn more together than if they were on their own, if conditions are right. Teachers may promote the idea of team learning to students in their classrooms, but teachers may not practice team learning in their professional lives; PLCs aim to help teachers practice the team learning that they preach. Senge suggests that when teams learn together there are beneficial results for the organization. Some school improvement evaluators have even claimed that \"high-quality collaboration has become no less than an imperative\".\n\nFor a school to be fully committed to implementing PLCs, the school's leadership must help establish and maintain PLCs. Successful PLCs will require a shift in the traditional leadership structure from leader-centered (top-down) to shared leadership. Sue C. Thompson and her colleagues pointed out how many educators often feel that \"new ideas that came from someone else without teacher input\" are a waste of time and do not qualify as true leadership or support. In a PLC, the view of the principal as the instructional leader changes to a view that reflects the principal as a member of a community of learners and leaders.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39530805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39530805", "title": "Proto-Finnic language", "text": "Proto-Finnic language\n\nProto-Finnic or Proto-Baltic-Finnic is the common ancestor of the Finnic languages, which include the national languages Finnish and Estonian. Proto-Finnic is not attested in any texts, but has been reconstructed by linguists. Proto-Finnic is itself descended ultimately from Proto-Uralic.\n\nThree stages of Proto-Finnic are distinguished in literature.\n\n\n\nThe sounds of Proto-Finnic can be reconstructed through the comparative method.\n\nReconstructed Proto-Finnic is traditionally transcribed using the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet. The following UPA and related conventions are adopted in this article for transcribing Proto-Finnic forms:\n\nThe Proto-Finnic consonant inventory had relatively few phonemic fricatives, much like that of the modern Finnic languages. Voicing was not phonemically contrastive, but the language did possess voiced allophones of certain voiceless consonants.\n\nThe table below lists the consonantal phonemes of Late Proto-Finnic. Phones written in parentheses represent allophones and are not independent phonemes. When a consonant is notated in this article with a symbol distinct from the corresponding IPA symbol, the former is given first, followed by the latter.\n\n\nProto-Finnic possessed two phonemic levels of consonant duration, short and long (geminate). The contrast itself had been inherited from Proto-Uralic, but was considerably expanded: all consonants except *r, *h, *j and *w could be short or long. The three plosives and the affricate \"*c\" also possessed a half-long duration (, , and ), but these were in complementary (allophonic) distribution with fully long consonants, and therefore were not phonemic. They appeared in predictable positions as a result of consonant gradation, like the voiced fricatives.\n\nConsonant gradation was a process of lenition that affected the obstruents. Short plosives became voiced fricatives, while long plosives became half-long:\n\nVoiced plosives occurred after nasals (\"mb nd ŋg\"), voiced fricatives in all other weak grade environments.\n\nIt is unclear if single \"*c\" gradated, and if so, into what. No Finnic language has consonant gradation for former \"*c\", both grades result in the same outcome (mostly \"s\").\n\nGradation occurred in two different environments, and can therefore be split into two types:\n\nIt is unclear whether consonant gradation was a Finnic innovation, or a retention of an old Uralic feature that was lost in most other Uralic branches. It is likely that it was inherited from an earlier stage that was also the ancestor of the Sami languages, which have gradation that is very similar to that found in the Finnic languages. However, it was still productive after certain sound changes specific to Finnic, such as the apocope of final \"*-i\", so it was probably present as a phonetic \"post-processing\" rule (Surface filter) over a long period of time. It is no longer fully productive in any Finnic language, but most languages still retain large amounts of words preserving the earlier alternations.\n\nThe Proto-Finnic vowel inventory was very similar to that of modern Finnish, although the distribution of the sounds was different. The following table lists the monophthong vowels reconstructable for Proto-Finnic.\n\nAll vowels could occur both short and long. In Proto-Uralic, rounded vowels (\"*u\", \"*ü\", \"*o\") could not occur in non-initial syllables, but because of sound changes, they did appear in Proto-Finnic.\n\nThe short unrounded mid back vowel \"*ë\" was not an independent vowel, but appeared as the counterpart of the front vowel \"*e\" in the system of harmony. It merged with \"*e\" in most Finnic languages, but not in South Estonian or Votic. See below under vowel harmony for more details.\n\nThe status of short \"*ö\" is unclear. It was not present in ancestral Proto-Uralic, and many instances of \"ö\" found in modern Finnic languages have only developed after Proto-Finnic, due to various sound changes. For example, Finnish has \"öy\" from \"*eü\": \"löytä-\" 'to find', \"köysi\" 'rope' < Proto-Finnic \"*leütä-\", \"*keüci\", while Estonian has unrounded the diphthong instead, giving \"leida-\" and \"köis\". Short \"ö\" was also generally added to the system for reasons of symmetry, to complete the system of vowel harmony (see below). This happened in Finnish \"näkö\" 'sight' < Proto-Finnic \"*näko\", but not in Votic \"näko\".\n\nThe existence of long \"öö\" is clear, as this sound had regularly evolved from other combinations of sounds, in words of Uralic origin (e.g. \"*söö-\" 'to eat' ← Proto-Uralic \"*sewi-\").\n\nProto-Finnic also possessed diphthongs, which were formed by combinations of a short vowel with the vowels , and , or equivalently with the semivowels and .\n\nNo length contrast occurred in diphthongs. A long vowel followed by a close vowel as a suffix was shortened: e.g. the imperfect forms of \"*saa-\" \"to receive\", \"*söö-\" \"to eat\" were \"*sai\", \"*söi\". This process is the only reconstructible source of \"*öi\", \"*üi\".\n\nProto-Finnic possessed a system of vowel harmony very similar to the system found in modern Finnish. Vowels in non-initial syllables had either a front or a back vowel, depending on the quality of the vowel of the first syllable. If the first syllable contained a front vowel, non-initial syllables would contain such vowels as well, while back vowels in the first syllable would be matched with back vowels in the other syllables. Thus, all inflectional and derivational suffixes came in two forms, a front-harmonic and a back-harmonic variety.\n\nIn non-initial syllables, the vowels \"e\" and \"i\" were originally a single reduced schwa-like vowel in Proto-Uralic, but had become differentiated in height over time. \"i\" arose word-finally, while \"e\" appeared medially. These vowels were front vowels at the time, and had back-vowel counterparts \"ë\" and \"ï\". In Proto-Finnic, \"ï\" had merged into \"i\", so that \"i\" was now neutral to vowel harmony and could occur in both front-vowel and back-vowel words, even if it was phonetically a front vowel. The vowels \"e\" and \"ë\" appeared to have remained distinct in Proto-Finnic, and remained so in North and South Estonian (as \"e\" and \"õ\") and Votic. In the other Finnic languages, they merged as \"e\".\n\nStress was not phonemic. Words were stressed in a trochaic pattern, with primary stress on the first syllable of a word, and secondary stress on every following odd-numbered syllable.\n\nRoot words included at least two moras, and generally followed the structure CVCV, CVCCV, CVVCV. Rarer root types included monosyllabic roots, CVV, with either a long vowel (e.g. \"*maa\" \"land, earth\"; \"*puu\" \"tree, wood\") or a diphthong (e.g. \"*täi\" \"louse\", \"*käü-däk\" \"to walk\"); roots with three syllables: CVCVCV (e.g. \"*petägä\" \"pine\"; \"*vasara\" \"hammer\") or CVCCVCV (e.g. \"*kattila\" \"kettle\"); and roots with a long vowel in a closed syllable: CVVCCV (e.g. \"*mëëkka\" \"sword\"). A syllable (and, hence, a word) could begin and end with at most one consonant. Any consonant phoneme could begin or end a syllable, but word-finally only the alveolar consonants (\"*l\", \"*n\", \"*t\", \"*r\", \"*s\" and perhaps \"*c\") and the velars \"*k\" and \"*h\" could appear. Final \"*-k\" and \"*-h\" were often lost in the later Finnic languages, but occasionally left traces of their former presence.\n\nWord-internal consonant clusters were limited to two elements originally. However, the widespread syncope of \"-e-\" (detailed above) could cause a cluster to come into contact with a third consonant. When such impermissible clusters appeared, this was generally solved by deleting one or more elements in the cluster, usually the first. Likewise, the apocope of \"-i\" after two or more syllables could create word-final clusters, which were also simplified. This led to alternations that are still seen, though unproductive, in e.g. Finnish:\n\n\nNote in the examples of \"tuhatta\" and \"kolmatta\" that Proto-Finnic did not initially tolerate clusters of a sonorant plus a geminate consonant (i.e. clusters like \"-ntt-\"). Through loanwords and further syncope, these have only later become permissible in the Finnic languages.\n\nTraditionally a single three-consonant cluster \"*-str-\" has been reconstructed for a small group of words showing \"*-tr-\" in Southern Finnic and in Eastern Finnish, \"*-sr-\" in Karelian and Veps, and in Western Finnish. This has recently been suggested to be reinterpreted as a two-consonant cluster \"*-cr-\" with an affricate as the initial member.\n\nAll inflectional and derivational endings containing \"a\" or \"u\" also had front-vowel variants with \"ä\" and \"ü\", which matched the vowels in the word stem following the rules of vowel harmony. \"o\" did not follow this rule, as noted above.\n\nEndings which closed the final syllable of a word triggered radical gradation on that syllable. An ending could also open a previously closed syllable, which would undo the gradation. Suffixal gradation affected the endings themselves. For example, partitive \"-ta\" would appear as \"-da\" when added to a two-syllable word ending in a vowel (e.g. *\"kala\", *\"kalada\" \"fish\"), but as \"-ta\" after a third syllable or a consonant (*\"veci\", *\"vettä\" \"water\").\n\nProto-Finnic nouns declined in at least 13 cases. Adjectives did not originally decline, but adjective-noun agreement was innovated in Proto-Finnic, probably by influence of the nearby Indo-European languages. The plural of the nominative and accusative was marked with the ending \"-t\", while the plural of the other cases used \"-i-\". The genitive and accusative singular were originally distinct (genitive \"*-n\", accusative \"*-m\"), but had fallen together when final \"*-m\" became \"*-n\" through regular sound change. Some pronouns had a different accusative ending, which distinguished them.\n\nThe following cases were present:\n\nThe genitive plural was formed in two different ways:\nBoth types are still found in Finnish, although unevenly distributed. In the western type, the regular loss of \"-d-\" after an unstressed (even-numbered) syllable has created forms such as \"-ain\" (< \"*-a-den\"), which are now archaic, or dialectal.\n\nAdjectives formed comparatives using the suffix \"*-mpa\". This suffix survives in all Finnic languages, although in several the nominative has been replaced with \"-mpi\" for unclear reasons.\n\nOnly the northernmost Finnic languages have a distinct superlative suffix, like Finnish \"-in\" ~ \"-impa-\". The suffix was possibly originally a consonantal stem \"*-im(e)-\", which was modified to resemble the comparative more closely in Finnish. Its consonantal nature is apparent in an older, now-obsolete essive case form of the superlative in Finnish, which ended in \"-inna\" (< \"*-im-na\" < \"*-ime-na\" with syncope).\n\nProto-Finnic had a series of possessive suffixes for nominals, which acted partly as genitives. These have been lost from productive use in all southern languages (traces remain in e.g. folk poetry). The system given below may therefore represent Proto-Northern Finnic rather than Proto-Finnic proper.\nThe original vowels in the plural possessor endings are not settled: evidence exists for both \"*A\" (that is, \"*a\" ~ \"*ä\") and \"*e\". recognizes variation only for 1PP and 2PP (giving \"*A\" for 3PP). , giving an Early Proto-Finnic paradigm, does not include vowel-final variants for 3PS.\n\nPossessive suffixes were ordered after case endings, and typically attach to the oblique vowel stem: e.g. \"*sormi\" : \"*sorme-mi\" 'my finger'.\n\nThe number-of-possessed contrast is by the 20th century lost everywhere except in the Southeastern Tavastian dialect of Finnish, around the municipalities of Iitti and Orimattila, and even there only in the nominative in the first and second person singular. The original 3PS / 3PP contrast is lost everywhere except Ingrian. In most cases, both ending variants however still remain in use, with different endings generalized in different varieties. Standard Finnish adopts 1PP \"-mme\" (derived from the singular possessed series, with analogical \"mm\" based on the verbal inflection), but 1PS \"-ni\", 2PP \"-nne\" (derived from the plural possessed series, with regular \"*nd\" > \"nn\"); and adopts 3PS \"-nsA\" in the nominative, illative and instructive (nominative \"käte-nsä\" 'her/his hand'), but \"-Vn\" (< \"*-hen\") in all other cases (e.g. inessive \"kädessä-än\" 'in her/his hand'). New plurality-of-possessed marking has emerged in the Soikkola dialect of Ingrian, suffixing the usual nominative plural marker \"-t\", e.g. \"venehe-mme-t\" 'our boats'. \n\nOld Finnish shows two archaic features in the possessive paradigm: the number-of-possessed contrast (singular \"poikaise-mi\" 'my son', versus plural \"luu-ni\" 'my bones'), and the 2nd person singular ending may attach also to the consonant stem of a nominal, with a non-assibilated ending \"-ti\" (the expected regular development before old \"*s\", \"*t\" and \"*h\" < \"*š\"): e.g. \"rakkaus\" : \"rakkaut-ti\" 'your love', \"tutkain\" : \"tutkain-ti\" 'your prod' (modern Finnish \"rakkaute-si\", \"tutkaime-si\"). \n\nA series of dual possessors has been proposed to account for the two different variants of 3PS, 1PP and 2PP endings; the variants ending in \"*-n\" would match with the dual possessor endings in Proto-Samic. This hypothesis has not been generally accepted.\n\nProto-Finnic inherited at least the following grammatical moods:\n\n\nThe indicative mood distinguished between present (which also functioned as future) and past tense, while the other moods had no tense distinctions. New \"perfect\" and \"pluperfect\" tenses had also been formed, probably by influence of the Indo-European languages. These were created using a form of the copula *\"oldak\" \"to be\" and a participle.\n\nThere were six forms for each mood, for three persons and two numbers. In addition, there were two more forms. One was a form that is often called \"passive\" or \"fourth person\", and indicated an unspecified person. The second was the \"connegative\" form, which was used together with the negative verb to form negated sentences.\n\nAll moods except the imperative shared more or less the same endings:\n\nThe first and second person plural endings show evidence (reflected in Savo and Southern Ostrobothnian Finnish and in Karelian) for an earlier present tense marker, assimilated with the following consonant. This is normally reconstructed as *-k- (*-km- > *-mm-, *-kt- > *-tt-), on the assumption of this ending being originally identical with *-k found in the connegative and in the imperative mood.\n\nThe variation between forms with *-ek and forms with *-a in the 1st and 2nd person plural reflects a former distinction between the dual and the plural (respectively), although this has not been attested from any Finnic variety. Estonian and Western Finnish continue *-ek, Votic and Eastern Finnic *-a(k).\n\nThe third person forms only had an ending in the present indicative. In all other tenses and moods, there was no ending and the singular and plural were identical. The 3rd person singular was entirely unmarked in South Estonian: the Late Proto-Finnic ending had evolved from the participle *-pa during the Middle Proto-Finnic stage, and this innovation had not reached South Estonian, which was already separated.\n\nThe imperative had its own set of endings:\n\nThere is also some evidence of a distinct optative mood, which is preserved in Finnish as \"-os\" (second-person singular). It is reconstructed as \"*-go-s\", consisting of the mood suffix \"*-ko-\" and the second-person singular ending \"*-s\". This mood suffix gave rise to alternative imperative forms in some languages, such as Finnish third-person singular \"-koon\" < \"*-ko-hen\" (the plural \"-koot\" has \"-t\" by analogy) and passive \"-ttakoon\" < \"*-tta-ko-hen\".\n\nIn addition, there were also several non-finite forms.\n\nProto-Finnic, like its descendants, expressed negation using a special negative verb. This verb was defective and inflected only in the indicative (\"does not\", \"did not\") and the imperative (\"do not\") moods. The main verb was placed in its special connegative form, and expressed the main mood. The negative verb was also suppletive, having the stem \"*e-\" in the indicative and variously \"*äl-\", \"*al-\", \"*är-\" in the imperative. This has been partially levelled in Votic and most of Eastern Finnic, which show an imperative stem \"*el-\".\n\nPast tense inflection was based on the stem *es-. This is retained as a separate category only in South Estonian and Livonian, but lost in all other Finnic languages. replaced by a construction of present tense of the negative verb, plus past active participle. The distinctive Kodavere dialect of Estonian, however, adopts this and not the present stem as the basic negative verb stem: \"esin\" \"I don't\", \"esid\" \"you (sg.) don't\", \"es\" \"s/he doesn't\" etc.\n\nOriginally, the negative verb may have had participles and other moods as well. However, no clear traces of moods other than the indicative are found in any Finnic language. A remnant of what may be either a present active participle or an archaic third-person singular present form survives in the prefix \"*epä-\" \"un-, not\" (Finnish \"epä-\", Estonian \"eba-\"), while a remnant of a 2nd infinitive instructive may survive in dialectal Finnish \"eten-\" \"without doing\".\n\nNegation of non-finite constructions was expressed using the abessive case of the infinitives or participles.\n\nThe following is an overview of the more important changes that happened after the Proto-Finnic period.\n\nThese changes happened very late in the Proto-Finnic period, but as South Estonian developed somewhat differently, it shows that dialectal diversification was beginning to occur around this time.\n\nIn South Estonian, \"*p\" and \"*k\" assimilate to a following dental obstruent, while \"*t\" assimilates to \"*k\", and \"*čk\" remains distinct from \"*tk\".\n\nIn all Finnic dialects, original \"*pt\" and \"*kt\" have the same reflex. It is therefore impossible to distinguish them in reconstruction, unless there is additional internal evidence (in the form of grammatical alternations) or external evidence (from non-Finnic languages).\n\nThe non-geminated \"*c\" becomes \"*s\" generally: Proto-Finnic \"*veci\" \"water\", \"*cika\" \"pig\", \"*-inen\" : \"*-ice-\" (adjective suffix) > Finnish \"vesi\", \"sika\", \"-(i)nen\" : \"-(i)se-\". However, occasionally \"ts\" or \"ds\" remains in South Estonian: Võro \"tsiga\", \"-ne\" : \"-dse-\" or \"-se-\" (but \"vesi\"). The merging of \"*c\" and \"*s\" often makes it impossible to distinguish the two sounds using Finnic evidence alone, if internal reconstruction is not viable (e. g., from \"t\" ~ \"s\" alternations from assibilation).\n\nThe geminate affricate \"*cc\" generally remains, often spelled . In Karelian, Ingrian, Votic and some Finnish dialects, the two grades remain distinguished (in Karelian as : , in Ingrian and Votic as ~ ). In all other Finnic languages the two grades fall together (written in Veps as , as in the others).\n\nIn early Finnish, both grades were fronted to interdental \"θθ\" : \"θ\", which in most dialects later changed into a variety of other dialect-specific sounds. Examples found are gradation patterns \"tt\" : \"t\", \"ht\" : \"h\", \"ht\" : \"t\", \"ss\" : \"s\" or non-gradating \"tt\" or \"ht\". In early written Finnish, the interdental fricatives are written as (for both grades) in the earliest records, which in Standard Finnish has led to the spelling pronunciation (treated as a consonant cluster and hence no longer subject to consonant gradation).\n\nIn the southern Finnic languages, a new back unrounded mid vowel develops from \"*e\" in words with back vowel harmony. For example Proto-Finnic \"*velka\" \"debt\" > Estonian \"võlg\", Võro \"võlg\", but > Finnish \"velka\". South Estonian and Votic show this development in all syllables, so that \"e\" and \"õ\" become a front and back vowel harmony pair. This may have also occurred in the earlier history of north (Standard) Estonian, but vowel harmony was later abandoned, undoing the change if it did occur.\n\nIn South Estonian, \"õ\" is in front of a nasal then raised to a central unrounded vowel (represented orthographically as ), parallel to the development of the other mid vowels. E.g. Võro \"ynn\"', Estonian \"õnn\" \"luck\"; Võro \"ryngas\", Estonian \"rõngas\" \"ring\".\n\nIn Estonian and Votic, more rarely Livonian, instances of \"õ\" also develop by unrounding of earlier short \"*o\". The detailed history of this change is unclear and shows much variation even between individual dialects of (North) Estonian. The development of \"*o\" to \"õ\" is the most general in Votic (if recent loanwords from Ingrian, Finnish and Russian are discounted) and in the Kodavere dialect of Estonian. Three main groups can thus be distinguished:\n\nA particularly interesting example is \"to take\", which suggests that at least some instances of this change preceded the general Finnic loss of word-initial \"*v-\" before rounded vowels, which affected Finnish and rest of Northern Finnic (which kept a rounded vowel) but not Estonian and the rest of Southern Finnic (which unrounded the vowel). It therefore must have occurred very early, in dialectal Proto-Finnic times.\n\nIn a small number of words, Estonian and Votic \"õ\" can be additionally found in correspondence to North Finnic \"a\" or \"u\". Livonian and South Estonian might align with either side, depending on the word. E.g. \n\nShort final vowels are lost after long syllables (two consonants or a syllable with a long vowel or diphthong) in Veps, partly Ludian, both North and South Estonian, and most Southwestern dialects of Finnish. For example, Proto-Finnic \"*kakci\" \"two\", \"*neljä\" \"four\", \"*viici\" \"five\" > Estonian \"kaks\", \"neli\", \"viis\", Veps \"kaks\"', \"nel<nowiki>'</nowiki>l<nowiki>'</nowiki>\", \"viž\", Võro \"katś\", \"nelli\", \"viiś\", but > standard Finnish \"kaksi\", \"neljä\", \"viisi\". This change occurred before the loss of final consonants (if any), as vowels that were originally followed by a consonant were not lost. The loss of final \"*-i\" leaves phonemic palatalization of the preceding consonant in many languages, on which see below.\n\nColloquial Finnish loses word-final \"i\" under more limited conditions, in particular after \"s\" (e.g. \"kaks\" \"two\", \"viis\" \"5\"; inflectional endings such as \"aamuks\" \"for/to the morning\" (translative), \"talos\" \"your house\" (2nd person singular possessive), \"tulis\" \"would come\" (3rd person singular conditional)) as well as word-final \"a/ä\" from several inflectional endings (e.g. inessive \"-s(s)\", elative \"-st\", adessive \"-l(l)\", ablative \"-lt\").\n\nIn Livonian, all short final vowels except \"*a\" and \"*ä\" are lost, thus giving \"*kakci\" > \"kakš\" as in Estonian, but also \"*veci\" \"water\" > \"ve'ž\", while no vowel was lost in \"*neljä\" > \"nēļa\", \"*kala\" \"fish\" > \"kalā\".\n\nUnstressed \"*o\" merges into \"*u\" in Northern Estonian.\n\nVowel harmony is lost in Estonian, Livonian and partly Veps, but not South Estonian or Votic. For example, Proto-Finnic \"*külä\" \"village\" > Estonian \"küla\", but > Finnish \"kylä\", Veps \"külä\", Votic \"tšülä\", Võro \"külä\". In Finnish and Karelian, vowel harmony was retained and extended to \"*o\" as well, creating a new vowel \"*ö\" in words with front vowel harmony.\n\nMany languages in the Southern Finnic group, as well as again Veps and Southwestern Finnish, show loss of unstressed vowels in medial syllables. In these languages, vowel length is lost before \"h\" early on, while diphthongs are simplified into short vowels.\n\nPalatalized consonants are reintroduced into most varieties other than Western Finnish. The most widespread source is regressive palatalization due to a lost word-final or word-medial \"*-i\" (a form of cheshirization), and consonant clusters with \"*j\" as a second member. In several varieties, there is also progressive palatalization, where a diphthong ending in \"*-i\" and the long vowel \"*ii\" causes palatalization of a following consonant.\n\n\nEstonian, Votic and Finnish do not have general palatalization, and \"š\" occurs almost solely in loanwords, most commonly of Russian or German origin.\n\nFinal \"*-k\" was generally lost. It is preserved in some dialects:\n\nFinal \"*-h\" is widely lost as well. It is preserved:\n\nTraces of both \"*-k\" and \"*-h\" remain in Finnish, where the consonants became a sandhi effect, assimilating to the initial consonant of the following word and lengthening it. This effect does not occur in all dialects and is not represented orthographically, but is often noted with a superscript \"ˣ\" in reference works. In Western dialects there was also metathesis of \"*h\", which preserved the original \"*h\" along with sandhi lengthening, e.g. Proto-Finnic \"*mureh\" \"sorrow\" > Western Finnish \"murheˣ\" (Karelian \"mureh\", Võro \"murõh\"/\"murõq\") and Proto-Finnic \"*veneh\" \"boat\" > Western Finnish \"venheˣ\" (Karelian/Veps \"veneh\", Võro \"vineh\"/\"vineq\").\nStandard Finnish inconsistently adopts some words in their Western Finnish shape (e.g. \"murhe\"; \"perhe\" \"family\", \"valheellinen\" \"untrue\"), some in their Eastern Finnish shape (e.g. \"vene\"; \"vale\" \"lie\").\n\nFinal \"*-n\" is lost in most of the South Finnic area (as well as widely in modern-day colloquial Finnish). In Votic this triggers compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel. The 1st person verbal ending resists the change, and generally remains as \"-n\".\n\nLoss of final consonants followed the loss of final vowels. Thus, vowels followed by a lost consonant were preserved.\n\nThe voiced obstruents \"*b/β\", \"*d/δ\" and \"*g/γ\" that occurred as the weak grades of single plosives were often lost or modified in various ways. The simplest outcomes are in the marginal languages Livonian and Veps, where all three are reflected as plain voiced stops \"b\", \"d\" and \"g\" respectively regardless of environment. The remaining languages show more complex developments.\n\n\"*b/β\" develops relatively uniformly:\n\nThe development of \"*d/δ\" is more diverse:\n\n\"*g/γ\" develops somewhat similar to \"*d/δ\", but with several conditional outcomes:\n\nThe loss of consonants often created new long vowels and diphthongs, particularly in non-initial syllables. Compare for example:\n\nIn all Finnic languages except Finnish, Northern Karelian and Votic, the voiceless (strong grade) obstruent consonants \"*p\", \"*t\", \"*k\" and \"*s\", are lenited to voiced or lax voiceless obstruents \"b\", \"d\", \"g\", \"z\" when occurring between voiced sounds. In Veps and Livonian, these new voiced plosives merge with their weak grade counterparts. In Estonian \"s\" remains voiceless and \"b\", \"d\", \"g\" are not fully voiced, instead remaining as lax voiceless consonants , , .\n\nIn many Finnic languages, long vowels develop into opening diphthongs by raising the onset, or show general raising instead.\n\nThe long mid vowels \"*oo\", \"*öö\" and \"*ee\" become opening diphthongs , , in Finnish, Karelian, and several marginal dialects of Northern Estonian. In Western Finnish dialects their second component widely becomes more open, producing , , or even , and either or depending on vowel harmony. Diphthongization also occurs in Livonian, but only under certain conditions, and the mid back unrounded long vowel \"õõ\" is not affected. In Livonian, the short vowels \"*o\" and \"*e\" may also diphthongize, leading to a contrast of short \"uo\", \"ie\" , with long \"ūo\", \"īe\" , .\n\nIn South Estonian, raising only occurs in overlong syllables, and results in long close vowels \"uu\", \"üü\" and \"ii\".\n\nIn Eastern Finnish and Karelian, the low vowels \"*aa\" and \"*ää\" also diphthongize, becoming Karelian \"oa\", \"eä\", Savonian \"ua\", \"iä\". In standard Livonian, long \"*aa\" of any origin is at a late date generally raised to \"ǭ\" .\n\nThe diphthong \"*eü\" is fully labialized to \"öü\" in Northern Finnic and South Estonian. In northern dialects of Veps, new long close vowels are created by the raising of several diphthongs:\n\nNorth Estonian instead unrounds all diphthongs ending in \"-ü\" to \"-i\":\n\nIn Savonian Finnish, the 2nd element of all diphthongs is lowered:\n\nIn Livonian, \"*au\" is labialized to \"ou\", and \"*äi\" is palatalized to \"ei\". Following this, the mid diphthongs are smoothed to long vowels under certain conditions:\n\nA variety of languages shows a change of a syllable-final consonant into a vowel. This is not one single change, but several independent developments.\n\nIn the Southern Finnic group, \"*n\" is lost before \"*s\" (< Proto-Finnic \"*s\" or \"*c\"), with compensatory lengthening of the perceding vowel. For example Proto-Finnic \"*kanci\" \"lid\", \"*pensas\" \"bush\" > Estonian \"kaas\", \"põõsas\", but > Finnish \"kansi\", \"pensas\".\n\nIn Western Finnish, stop consonants before a sonorant are vocalized to \"u\". E.g. \"*kapris\" \"goat\", \"*atra\" \"plough\", \"*kakra\" \"oats\" > Finnish \"kauris\", \"aura\", \"kaura\", but > Estonian \"kaber\", \"ader\", \"kaer\", Karelian \"kapris\", \"atra\", \"kakra\". Standard Finnish mostly follows the Western Finnish model. Some notable exceptions include \"kekri\" \"All Saints' Eve feast\", \"kupla\" \"bubble\".\n\nSyllable-final \"*l\" is vocalized in Veps at a late date, creating \"u\"-final diphthongs in the northern and central dialects, long vowels in the southern.\n\n"}

Etty had become famous for nude paintings, and acquired a reputation for tastelessness, indecency and a lack of creativity. With \"The Destroying Angel\" he hoped to disprove his critics with an openly moral piece. The painting is 127.8 cm by 101.9 cm (50 in by 40 in) and depicts a classical temple under attack from a destroying angel and a group of daemons. Some of the humans appear dead or unconscious, others flee or struggle against the daemons.\n\nWhen first exhibited in 1832, \"The Destroying Angel\" was widely praised for its technical brilliance, but critics were divided on the subject matter. Some praised its vivid blend of fear and beauty; others criticised its theme as inappropriate, and chastised Etty for wasting his talent. As Etty had hoped, the painting changed critics' perception of him; some saw it as indicating previously unseen depths, others considered it a renunciation of his previous work. Henry Payne, who had commissioned the painting, sold it in 1854 to Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth donated it in 1882 to the Manchester Art Gallery, where it remains.\n\nWilliam Etty (1787–1849), the seventh son of a York baker and miller, had originally been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his seven-year apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to London to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Many of his peers greatly admired him, and he was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable.\n\nBetween 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nudes. While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received, many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent. Etty's \"Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm\", completed in 1830 and exhibited in 1832, attracted scathing criticism for its supposed seductive and sensual nature, leading \"The Morning Chronicle\" to comment that \"[Etty] should not persist, with an unhallowed fancy, to pursue Nature to her holy recesses. He is a laborious draughtsman, and a beautiful colourist; but he has not taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on the naked truth.\"\n\nNeedled by repeated attacks from \"The Morning Chronicle\" on his supposed indecency, poor taste and lack of creativity, Etty determined to produce a work that would prove his detractors wrong. The result was \"The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate\".\n\n\"The Destroying Angel\" was commissioned by Henry Payne of Leicester in 1822, on a promise of 60 guineas (about £ in today's terms) when complete. Payne had granted Etty complete freedom in the creation of the piece, but Etty had done little with the notion until, stung by \"The Morning Chronicle\"'s criticism, he decided to return to the theme, completing it in 1832. As Etty had become a more prominent painter in the meantime, Payne paid him £130 (about £ in today's terms) for the piece. The work is thought to have been inspired by the works of John Milton and Alexander Pope, by Michelangelo's \"The Last Judgment\" and possibly by the French Revolution of 1830, in which Etty had been caught up during a visit to Paris to study in the Louvre. The topic was one to which Etty felt particularly close, saying that he had put his \"whole soul\" into the piece.\n\n\"The Destroying Angel\" is a visionary work, depicting a wholly imaginary scene rather than a scene from history, literature or mythology. It measures 127.8 cm by 101.9 cm (50 in by 40 in), and depicts an ornate imaginary classical temple. The temple and its occupants are under attack from a destroying angel and a group of daemons, who are in the process of abducting its human occupants. The angel itself is wreathed in smoke in the centre of the image. Having destroyed one side of the temple, it is poised to hurl a thunderbolt. Below the angel, daemons attack a group of around 25 semi-naked human figures. Each human is shown in a different position and expresses terror differently, and each is deliberately painted in paler tones than those Etty typically used to suggest death and pallor. As with most of Etty's works, the figures are a collection of depictions of models in studio poses, later arranged for dramatic effect, rather than painted as a group.\n\nTo the right of the painting, daemons drag terrified women away. The woman in the lower right-hand corner turns to see flames reflected in the eyes of the daemon who holds her from behind, with a look of horrified guilt on her face. Behind her, other women struggle helplessly with the daemons or are carried away unconscious, having fainted.\n\nIn the centre of the foreground is a figure modelled on Caius Gabriel Cibber's \"Raving Madness\", which at the time was one of two monumental sculptures above the entrance to Bethlem Hospital (\"Bedlam\"), and a well-known London landmark and symbol of insanity. The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a daemon pulls on one end of the chain. Beside this lunatic is an unconscious or dead gambler, his winnings spread on the floor beside him.\nBehind the central images of the lunatic, daemon and gambler are a group of people who have only just realised what is happening. A male figure in a red Phrygian cap (a symbol of the French and American Revolutions) reclines with his arm around the waist of a female figure (identified as a bacchante by Sarah Burnage of the University of York). The female figure shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or to block out the horror taking place in front of her.\n\nOn the left-hand side of the painting, in the background, the structure of the temple crumbles and burns in the wake of the angel's path, while figures in varying stages of undress flee the approaching daemons. In the foreground a drunken man mimics the pose of the Barberini Faun as he clutches his head, alert enough to realise his fate if he does not escape but too intoxicated to flee.\n\nAround the painting lie corpses in various states of undress. \"The Destroying Angel\" was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in \"The Destroying Angel\" were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.\n\n\"The Destroying Angel\" was first exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1832. It immediately generated much critical and public interest, and was compared favourably with \"The Fall of the Damned\" by Peter Paul Rubens, Michelangelo's \"The Last Judgment\" and \"Breughell's frightful fancies\".\nAlthough the painting was celebrated as a technical accomplishment, some critics were uncertain if it had the correct moral effect. \"The Library of the Fine Arts\" was critical of its \"pantomimic\" quality, which it considered \"calculated to excite any but such ideas as we should wish to see produced by Art\", while \"The Examiner\" complained about the depiction of women being attacked, arguing: \"Mr Etty should not treat the fair sex in this harsh and wanton manner. We doubt his right to put a single one of them into the hands of a Demon, much less to deliver them over by the dozen to the grasp of the destroyers.\" \"The Times\" said, We do not profess to understand what class of compositions that is which originates neither in history nor poetry—no doubt Mr. Etty does; but as far as we can comprehend his picture, which is much more intelligible than his language, it represents a quantity of able-bodied demons, who appear angry at the ladies for having stayed out so long, and who are come to fetch them home accordingly and criticised Etty for a \"slovenly manner\" and for \"abusing his rich gifts, and [wasting] upon the wild and unmeaning what might be made subservient to much more worthy purposes\". Despite this, the same critic conceded that \"The work is one of extraordinary power\" and that \"The figures are drawn with exquisite skill, the grouping admirably varied, and yet so combined as to present a complete picture, and the colouring vigorous and harmonious in an eminent degree.\"\n\nOther critics admired Etty's unusual interpretation of apocalyptic religious imagery, his ability to give distinct characters and shapes to the individual demons and their victims, and the vividness of his imagination. \"The Morning Post\" particularly praised Etty's ability to convey \"creation conceived and thrown upon the canvas with all the fury of poetical inspiration\" by combining the \"dauntless spirit of a sketch\" with the \"powerful impression of a finished picture\". The prominent art critic William Paulet Carey (writing under the name of 'Ridolfi') championed \"The Destroying Angel\", and in particular Etty's ability to balance beauty, horror and fear without descending into tastelessness. Carey saw Etty as proof that British artistic traditions were equal to any others in the world, and \"The Destroying Angel\" as evidence of Etty's \"redeeming grace and spirit\". Etty's long-standing adversaries at \"The Morning Chronicle\" found little to attack in the painting, their review stating that \"The upper part of the picture is masterly, grand and beautiful. The lower part not so well, but some of the figures are in admirable action and fine drawing.\" The reticence of \"The Morning Chronicle\" prompted Carey to comment that they were in \"envious silence\".\nDespite some criticism, \"The Destroying Angel\" changed the way Etty was perceived by critics. They commonly had viewed Etty's works as insights into his mind, generally with the aim of discrediting him for supposed sexual deviancies. Confronted with a piece so obviously intended to convey a moral lesson, many of those same critics felt that Etty had revealed a more moral nature than they had previously believed. Many explicitly saw \"The Destroying Angel\" as a counterweight to the nude paintings for which Etty was famous, or even a representation of Etty's own repentance for or renunciation of his previous works. \"Fraser's Magazine\" described the painting as \"a sermon to [Etty's] admirers ... where he inflicts poetical justice upon his own gay dames and their gallants, their revels being broken in upon, and they themselves being carried off most unceremoniously, like that \"little\" gentleman Don Juan, by sundry grim-looking brawny devils\".\n\nAfter 1832, Etty exhibited over 80 more paintings at the Summer Exhibition. He remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. Yet he remained, in the majority view, a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\". Etty remained commercially successful in his lifetime, amassing £17,000 (about £ in today's terms) by his death.\n\nEtty died in 1849, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Henry Payne sold \"The Destroying Angel\" in 1854 for 770 guineas (about £ in today's terms) to Sir Joseph Whitworth, who donated it in 1882 to the Manchester Art Gallery, where it remains. The painting was exhibited as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.\nAs Etty had rapidly fallen from fashion, his works had little influence on most subsequent painters. William Edward Frost was a great admirer of Etty, and Frost's \"Una Alarmed by Fauns\" (1843) and \"Una and the Wood Nymphs\" (1847) owe a conscious debt to \"The Destroying Angel\" in their depiction of a group of semi-clad daemonic and human figures, as does John Everett Millais's early work \"Cymon and Iphigenia\" (1848). As Etty's style became increasingly unpopular, those artists who had imitated him, other than Frost, soon abandoned the style. Etty's biographer Leonard Robinson contends that the later fairy paintings of Richard Dadd, which often show large crowds of mythical creatures mingling with humans, were influenced by Etty but concedes that Dadd was likely unconscious of Etty's influence on his style.\n\n"}

Robinson) who meets and becomes enamored with a young femme fatale.\n\nBased on J. H. Wallis' novel \"Once Off Guard\", the story features two surprise twists at the end. Scriptwriter Nunnally Johnson founded International Pictures (his own independent production company) after writing successful films such as \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1940) and other John Ford films, and chose \"The Woman in the Window\" as its premiere project. Director Fritz Lang substituted the film's dream ending in place of the originally scripted suicide ending, to conform with the moralistic Production Code of the time.\n\nThe term \"film noir\" originated as a genre description, in part, because of this movie. The term first was applied to American films in French film magazines in 1946, the year when \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941), \"Double Indemnity\" (1944), \"Laura\" (1944), \"Murder, My Sweet\" (1944), and \"The Woman in the Window\" were released in France.\n\nAt the 18th Academy Awards, \"The Woman in the Window\" was nominated for Best Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture for Hugo Friedhofer and Arthur Lange. However, Miklós Rózsa for \"Spellbound\" got the award.\n\nAfter psychology professor Richard Wanley (Edward G. Robinson) sends his wife and two children off on vacation, he goes to his club to meet friends. Next door, Wanley sees a striking oil portrait of Alice Reed (Joan Bennett) in a storefront window. He and his friends talk about the beautiful painting and its subject. Wanley stays at the club and reads Song of Songs. When he leaves, Wanley stops at the portrait and meets Reed, who is standing near the painting watching people gaze at it. Reed convinces Wanley to join her for drinks.\n\nLater, they go to Reed's home, but an unexpected visit from her rich clandestine lover Claude Mazard, known to Reed initially only as 'Frank Howard' (Arthur Loft), leads to a fight in which Wanley kills Mazard. Wanley and Reed conspire to cover up the murder, and Wanley disposes Mazard's body in the country. However, Wanley leaves many clues, and there are a number of witnesses. One of Wanley's friends from the club, district attorney Frank Lalor (Raymond Massey) has knowledge of the investigation, and Wanley is invited back to the crime scene, as Lalor's friend, but not as a suspect. There are several comic dialogues in which Wanley appears to know more about the murder than he should. As the police gather more evidence, Reed is blackmailed by Heidt (Dan Duryea), a crooked ex-cop who was Mazard's bodyguard. Reed attempts to poison Heidt with a prescription overdose when he returns the next day, but Heidt is suspicious and takes the money without drinking the drugs. Reed tells Wanley, who overdoses on the remaining prescription medicine.\n\nHeidt is killed in a shootout immediately after leaving Reed's home, and police believe Heidt is Mazard's murderer. Reed, seeing that the police have killed Heidt, races to her home to call Wanley, who is slumped over in his chair, and apparently he dies. In an impossible match on action, Wanley awakens in his chair at his club, and he realizes the entire adventure was a dream in which employees from the club were main characters in the dream. As he steps out on the street in front of the painting, a woman asks Wanley for a light. He adamantly refuses and runs down the street.\n\n\nAs in Lang's \"Scarlet Street\", released a year later, Edward G. Robinson plays the lonely middle-aged man and Duryea and Bennett co-star as the criminal elements. The two films also share the same cinematographer - Milton R. Krasner - and several supporting actors.\n\nWhen the film was released, the staff at \"Variety\" magazine lauded the film and wrote, \"Nunnally Johnson whips up a strong and decidedly suspenseful murder melodrama in \"Woman in the Window.\" The producer, who also prepared the screenplay (from the novel \"Once off Guard\" by J.H. Wallis), continually punches across the suspense for constant and maximum audience reaction. Added are especially fine timing in the direction by Fritz Lang and outstanding performances by Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, Raymond Massey and Dan Duryea.\" \n\nThe film holds a 95% fresh rating from Rotten Tomatoes as of July 2016. In August 2015, the online entertainment magazine \"Paste\" named the film as the best film noir of all time.\n\n\n"}

Other examples of cultural tourist attractions include historical places, monuments, ancient temples, zoos, aquaria, museums and art galleries, botanical gardens, buildings and structures (e.g.,Forts , castles, libraries, former prisons, skyscrapers, bridges), theme parks and carnivals, living history museums, public art (sculptures, statues, murals), signs, ethnic enclave communities, historic trains and cultural events. Factory tours, industrial heritage, creative art and crafts workshops are the object of cultural niches like industrial tourism and creative tourism. Many tourist attractions are also landmarks.\n\nTourist attractions are also created to capitalise on legends such as a supposed UFO crash site near Roswell, New Mexico and the alleged Loch Ness monster sightings in Scotland. Ghost sightings also make tourist attractions.\n\nEthnic communities may become tourist attractions, such as Chinatowns in the United States and the black British neighbourhood of Brixton in London, England.\n\nIn the United States, owners and marketers of attractions advertise tourist attractions on billboards along the side of highways and roadways, especially in remote areas. Tourist attractions often provide free promotional brochures and flyers in information centres, fast food restaurants, hotel and motel rooms or lobbies, and rest areas.\n\nWhile some tourist attractions provide visitors a memorable experience for a reasonable admission charge or even for free, others may be of low quality and overprice their goods and services (such as admission, food, and souvenirs) in order to profit excessively from tourists. Such places are commonly known as tourist traps.\n\nWithin cities, transport tourist attractions as rides by boats and buses (City Sightseeing, etc.) are popular.\n\nNovelty attractions are oddities such as the \"biggest ball of twine\" in Cawker City, Kansas, the Corn Palace in Mitchell, South Dakota, or Carhenge in Alliance, Nebraska, where old cars serve in the place of stones in a replica of Stonehenge. Novelty attractions are not limited to the American Midwest, but are part of Midwestern culture.\n\nThere is currently no widely accepted definition of the term \"tourist destination\". From the tourism industry supply perspective a destination is usually defined by a geo-political boundary, given destination marketing is most commonly funded by governments. From the traveler perspective, a destination might be perceived quite differently.\n\nA tourist destination is a city, town, or other area that is dependent to a significant extent on the revenues accruing from tourism, or \"a country, state, region, city, or town which is marketed or markets itself as a place for tourists to visit\". It may contain one or more tourist attractions and possibly some \"tourist traps\". Fátima town for example is a popular tourist destination in Portugal. Siem Reap town is a popular tourist destination in Cambodia, mainly owed to its proximity to Angkor temples. Loire valley, the third tourist destination in France is a good example of region marketed and branded as a place for tourists to visit, mainly known for its Châteaux of the Loire valley.\n\nA tropical island resort is an island or archipelago that also depends on tourism as its source of revenue. The Bahamas in Caribbean archipelago, Bali in Indonesia, Phuket in Thailand, Hawaii in the United States, Palawan in the Philippines, and Fiji in the Pacific, Vamizi Island, Santorini and Ibiza in Mediterranean are examples of popular island resorts.\n\nFrance, the United States, and Spain were the three most popular international destinations in 2017. The total number of international travelers arriving in those countries was about 234 million, contributing 8.9%, 7.7%, and 14.9%, respectively, to the total GDP of those countries.\n\nThe tourism industry generates substantial economic benefits to both host countries and tourists home countries. Especially in developing countries, one of the primary motivations for a region to promote itself as a tourism destination is the expected economic improvement. According to the World Tourism Organization, 698 million people travelled to a foreign country in 2000, spending more than US$478 billion. International tourism receipts combined with passenger transport currently total more than US$575 billion – making tourism the worlds number one export earner, ahead of automotive products, chemicals, petroleum and food.\n\nTourist attractions can:\n\nSome examples of tourist attractions are:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44434", "title": "Tractor beam", "text": "Tractor beam\n\nA tractor beam is a device with the ability to attract one object to another from a distance. The concept originates in fiction: the term was coined by E. E. Smith (an update of his earlier \"attractor beam\") in his novel \"Spacehounds of IPC\" (1931). Since the 1990s, technology and research has laboured to make it a reality, and have had some success on a microscopic level. Another method to realize tractor beams is based on the use of biaxial birefringent media. Less commonly, a similar beam that repels is called a pressor beam or repulsor beam. Gravity impulse and gravity propulsion beams are traditionally areas of research from fringe physics that coincide with the concepts of tractor and repulsor beams.\n\nA force field confined to a collimated beam with clean borders is one of the principal characteristics of tractor and repulsor beams. Several theories that have predicted repulsive effects do not fall within the category of tractor and repulsor beams because of the absence of field collimation. For example, Robert L. Forward, Hughes Research Laboratories, Malibu, California, showed that general relativity theory allowed the generation of a very brief impulse of a gravity-like repulsive force along the axis of a helical torus containing accelerated condensed matter. The mainstream scientific community has accepted Forward’s work. A variant of Burkhard Heim’s theory by Walter Dröscher, Institut für Grenzgebiete der Wissenschaft (IGW), Innsbruck, Austria, and Jocham Häuser, University of Applied Sciences and CLE GmbH, Salzgitter, Germany, predicted a repulsive force field of gravitophotons could be produced by a ring rotating above a very strong magnetic field. Heim’s theory, and its variants, have been treated by the mainstream scientific community as fringe physics. But the works by Forward, Dröscher, and Häuser could not be considered as a form of repulsor or tractor beam because the predicted impulses and field effects were not confined to a well defined, collimated region.\n\nThe following are a summary of experiments and theories that resemble repulsor and tractor beam concepts:\n\nIn July 1960, \"Missiles and Rockets\" reported Martin N. Kaplan, Senior Research Engineer, Electronics Division, Ryan Aeronautical Company, San Diego, had conducted experiments that justified planning for a more comprehensive research program. The article indicated such a program, if successful, would yield either “restricted” or “general” results. It described the “restricted” results as an ability to direct an anti-gravitational force towards or away from a second body.\n\nIn 1964, Copenhagen physicists, L. Halpern, Universitetets Institut for Teoretisk Fysik, and B. Laurent, Nordisk Institut for Teoretisk Atomfysik, indicated general relativity theory and quantum theory allowed the generation and amplification of gravitons in a manner like the LASER. They showed, in principle, gravitational radiation in the form of a beam of gravitons could be generated and amplified by using induced, resonant emissions.\n\nIn 1992, Russian Professor of Chemistry, Yevgeny Podkletnov, and Nieminen, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland, discovered weight fluctuations in objects above an electromagnetically levitated, massive, composite superconducting disk. Three years later, Podkletnov reported the results of additional experiments with a toroidal disk superconductor. They reported the weight of the samples would fluctuate between -2.5% and +5.4% as the angular speed of the superconductor increased. Certain combinations of disk angular speeds and electromagnetic frequencies caused the fluctuations to stabilize at a 0.3% reduction. The experiments with the toroidal disk yielded reductions that reached a maximum of 1.9-2.1%. Reports about both sets of experiments stated the weight loss region was cylindrical, extending vertically for at least three meters above the disk. Qualitative observations of an expulsive force at the border of the shielded zone were reported in the Fall of 1995.\n\nItalian physicist Giovanni Modanese, while a Von Humboldt Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Physics, made the first attempt to provide a theoretical explanation of Podkletnov’s observations. He argued the shielding effect and slight expulsive force at the border of the shielded zone could be explained in terms of induced changes in the local cosmological constant. Modanese described several effects in terms of responses to modifications to the local cosmological constant within the superconductor. Ning Wu, Institute of High Energy Physics, Beijing, China, used the theory of quantum gauge theory of gravity he had developed in 2001 to explain Podkletnov’s observations. Wu’s theory approximated the relative gravity loss as 0.03% (an order of magnitude smaller than the reported range of 0.3 – 0.5%).\n\nSeveral groups around the world tried to replicate Podkletnov’s gravity shielding observations. According to R. Clive Woods, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, those groups were not able to overcome the extremely challenging technical problems of replicating all aspects of the 1992 experimental conditions. Woods summarised those shortcomings in the following list:\n\nC. S. Unnikrishan, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay, India, showed that if the effect had been caused by gravitational shielding, the shape of the shielded region would be similar to a shadow from the gravitational shield. For example, the shape of the shielded region above a disk would be conical. The height of the cone's apex above the disk would vary directly with the height of the shielding disk above the earth. Podkeltnov and Nieminen described the shape of the weight loss region as a cylinder that extended through the ceiling above the cryostat. That factor and others precipitated a recommendation to reclassify the effect as gravitational modification instead of gravitational shielding. Such a reclassification means the region causing the weight modifications can be directed and is not limited to the space above the superconductor.\n\nIn 2001, Podkeltnov and Modanese reported the generation of a beam of gravity-like impulses. Their paper indicated a high voltage discharge device had been constructed that emitted a horizontal, collimated beam, with sharp borders, of short impulses of a repulsive force field that could penetrate different bodies without any noticeable loss of energy. Subsequently, the apparatus was dubbed an impulse gravity generator. Measurements of the impulses taken three to six meters beyond the emitter and in a building 150 meters away yielded identical results. Analyses of the measurements indicated the impulses briefly caused accelerations one thousand times the rate of gravity.\n\nThe gravity impulse generator received further theoretical support from David Maker and Glen A. Robertson, Gravi Atomic Research, Madison, Alabama and Wu. Chris Taylor, Jupiter Research Corporation, Houston, Texas, along with a private individual Robert Hendry and the original theorist Modanese conducted an analysis of the suitability of impulse gravity generators for Earth-to-orbit, interplanetary, and interstellar applications, this was repeated again in 2008 and a United States and European patent was received. In general, mainstream scientific community have treated the impulse gravity generator reports as extremely speculative and controversial. At least one other group based in central Europe has attempted to replicate Podkletnov's gravity impulse generator experiment, but they have elected not to publish their results.\n\nA team of scientists at the Australian National University led by Professor Andrei Rode created a device similar to a tractor beam to move small particles 1.5 meters through the air. Rather than create a new gravitational field, however, the device utilizes a doughnut-shaped Laguerre-Gaussian laser beam, which has a high intensity ring of light that surrounds a dark core along the beam axis. This method confines particles to the centre of the beam using photophoresis, whereby illuminated sections of the particle have a higher temperature and thus impart more momentum to air molecules incident on the surface. Owing to this method, it is impossible for such a device to work in space due to lack of air, but Professor Rode states that there are practical applications for the device on Earth such as, for example, the transportation of microscopic hazardous materials and other microscopic objects.\n\nJohn Sinko and Clifford Schlecht researched a form of reversed-thrust laser propulsion as a macroscopic laser tractor beam. Intended applications include remotely manipulating space objects at distances up to about 100 km, removal of space debris, and retrieval of adrift astronauts or tools on-orbit.\n\nIn March 2011, Chinese scientists posited that a specific type of Bessel beam (a special kind of laser that does not diffract at the centre) is capable of creating a pull-like effect on a given microscopic particle, forcing it towards the beam source. The underlining physics is the maximization of forward scattering via interference of the radiation multipoles. They show explicitly that the necessary condition to realize a negative (pulling) optical force is the simultaneous excitation of multipoles in the particle and if the projection of the total photon momentum along the propagation direction is small, attractive optical force is possible. The Chinese scientists suggest this possibility may be implemented for optical micromanipulation.\n\nFunctioning tractor beams based on solenoidal modes of light were demonstrated in 2010 by physicists at New York University.\nThe spiraling intensity distribution in these non-diffracting beams tends to trap illuminated objects and thus helps to \novercome the radiation pressure that ordinarily would drive them down the optical axis. \nOrbital angular momentum transferred from the solenoid beam's helical wavefronts then \ndrives the trapped objects upstream along the spiral. Both Bessel-beam and solenoidal tractor beams are being considered for \napplications in space exploration by NASA.\n\nIn 2013, scientists at the Institute of Scientific Instruments (ISI) and the university of St Andrews succeeded in creating a tractor beam that pulls objects on a microscopic level. The new study states that while this technique is new, it may have potential for bio-medical research. \nProfessor Zemanek said: “The whole team have spent a number of years investigating various configurations of particles delivery by light. \nDr Brzobohaty said: “These methods are opening new opportunities for fundamental photonics as well as applications for life-sciences.”\nDr Cizmar said: “Because of the similarities between optical and acoustic particle manipulation we anticipate that this concept will provide inspiration for exciting future studies in areas outside the field of photonics.”\n\nPhysicist from the Australian National University successfully built a reversible tractor beam, capable of transporting particles \"one fifth of a millimetre in diameter a distance of up to 20 centimetres, around 100 times further than previous experiments.\" According to Professor Wieslaw Krolikowski, of the Research School of Physics and Engineering, “demonstration of a large scale laser beam like this is a kind of holy grail for laser physicists.” The work was published in Nature in 2014.\n\nIn 2015, a team of researchers have built the world's first sonic tractor beam that can lift and move objects using sound waves. A DIY instructables to build your own toy acoustic tractor beam was made available.\n\nIn 2018, a research team from Tel-Aviv University led by Dr. Alon Bahabad experimentally demonstrated an optical analog of the famous Archimedes’ screw where the rotation of a helical-intensity laser beam is transferred to the axial motion of optically trapped micrometer-scale, airborne, carbon-based particles. With this optical screw, particles were easily conveyed with controlled velocity and direction, upstream or downstream of the optical flow, over a distance of half a centimeter.\n\nScience fiction movies and telecasts normally depict tractor and repulsor beams as audible, narrow rays of visible light that cover a small area of a target. Tractor beams are most commonly used on spaceships and space stations. They are generally used in three ways:\n\nIn the latter case, there are usually countermeasures that can be employed against tractor beams. These may include pressor beams (a stronger pressor beam will counteract a weaker tractor beam) or \"plane shears\" aka \"shearing planes\" (a device to \"cut\" the tractor beam and render it ineffective). In some fictional realities, shields can block tractor beams, or the generators can be disabled by sending a large amount of energy back up the beam to its source.\n\nTractor beams and pressor beams can be used together as a weapon: by attracting one side of an enemy spaceship while repelling the other, one can create severely damaging shear effects in its hull. Another mode of destructive use of such beams is rapid alternating between pressing and pulling force in order to cause structural damage to the ship as well as inflicting lethal forces on its crew.\n\nTwo objects being brought together by a tractor beam are usually attracted toward their common centre of gravity. This means that if a small spaceship applies a tractor beam to a large object such as a planet, the ship will be drawn towards the planet, rather than vice versa.\n\nIn \"Star Trek\", tractor beams are imagined to work by placing a target in the focus of a subspace/graviton interference pattern created by two beams from an emitter. When the beams are manipulated correctly the target is drawn along with the interference pattern. The target may be moved toward or away from the emitter by changing the polarity of the beams. Range of the beam affects the maximum mass that can be moved by the emitter, and the emitter subjects its anchoring structure to significant force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Transportation network companies are examples of the sharing economy and shared mobility.\n\nTransportation network companies have been noted for providing service in less populated or poorer areas that are not regularly served by taxicabs, and charging lower rates than taxicabs, since taxicab rates are often set by local jurisdictions. Some reports say TNCs reduce traffic congestion: since their cars \"can't accept street hails, they do much less unnecessary driving-around than either government-licensed/regulated taxi cabs (who are cruising for hails) or individuals (who are looking for a parking spot).\" TNCs say they provide \"flexible and independent jobs\" for drivers.\n\nStudies are inconclusive on whether TNCs reduce drunk driving rates in cities where they operate. A March 2016 study by Judd Cramer and Alan B. Krueger of the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that a ride via a TNC uses capacity more efficiently than traditional taxicabs as TNC drivers are more likely to have a passenger than a taxicab.\n\nIn 2013, the California Public Utilities Commission defined, for regulatory purposes, a transportation network company as a company that uses an online-enabled platform to connect passengers with drivers using their personal, non-commercial vehicles. Virginia defines a TNC as a company that \"provides prearranged rides for compensation using a digital platform that connects passengers with drivers using a personal vehicle.\"\n\nTNC platforms have sometimes been called \"ridesharing\", but the terms \"ridesourcing\" and \"ride hailing\" have been developed to describe the transportation services associated with TNCs. Some early reports used the term \"ridesourcing\" to clarify that drivers do not share a destination with their passengers and that the driver's primary motivation was income. The term \"ridesourcing\" refers to the outsourcing of rides. In early 2015, the Associated Press Stylebook officially adopted the term \"ride-hailing\" to describe the services offered by Lyft and Uber to reflect the availability of private vehicles and taxis services on the platforms. \"Ride-hailing\" makes no reference to the driver's motivation or to the trip characteristics; some rides may not necessarily be motivated by income. Uber allows drivers to match destinations with riders in limited cases. However, using \"ride-hailing\" interchangeably with \"ridesharing\" can be misleading. Companies like Uber and Lyft prohibit drivers from picking up 'hailers' as all of their riders need to be logged through their website or mobile app software to adhere to their terms and conditions and local laws. Otherwise these companies would be categorized as a 'taxi service.'\n\nDrivesharing is an arrangement where several drivers share a vehicle to transport rideshare passengers for a fee. Vehicles used in drivesharing are not owned by any of the drivers, but instead rented from a drivesharing (third-party) company that services or is in partnership with a TNC like Uber and Lyft. Drivesharing responds to the high demand of qualified drivers who are interested in working for TNC platforms but do not want to acquire or use their own vehicle to do so. Drivesharing companies aim to help the ridesharing industry by increasing ridesharing accessibility, getting more paid drivers on the road and reducing individual vehicle ownership for drivers and riders alike. \n\nFor example, TNCs are required by law to have a certain amount of wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs) on the road at any given time. This can be a difficult requirement for TNCs to meet because TNCs don't provide vehicles and most drivers do not own a WAV, causing a shortage. Third-party drivesharing companies are stepping in to help fill that gap by providing TNC approved WAV vehicles that drivers are incentivized through TNCs to use, therefore helping TNCs meet the WAV requirements.\n\nTaxi industry groups, labor unions, and some courts say that TNCs are illegal taxicab operations. Several communities, governments, and organizations have established rules and regulations that specifically govern TNCs and, in some jurisdictions, TNCs are completely illegal to operate.\n\nTNCs increase traffic congestion in some cities, due to the large number of TNC vehicles constantly cruising waiting for customers. Reports based on New York City data suggest that TNCs are unsustainable. The TNC model allows avoiding the costs of insurance, sales tax, mechanical vehicle inspections, and providing a universally-accessible service. Some critics believes that TNCs' success comes from being parasitic on the cities in which it operates. New regulations are proposed to compensate some of these disadvantages.\n\nServices like Uber and Lyft, even taking into account trips (as with UberPOOL and Lyft Line) where multiple passengers share the same vehicle, are also worsening traffic congestion. This is because they are attracting to customers who would otherwise have taken transit, walked, biked or avoided the trip, according to a study published in 2018.\n"}

It was one of the initial novels of Yandamuri that became popular and he was appreciated widely for his narrating style. It was partially inspired by the 1971 bestselling novel \"The Exorcist\". \"Tulasi Dalam\" was first adapted into a 1985 Kannada movie titled \"Thulasidala\" \nand later in Hindi as \"Phoonk\" (2008) and in Telugu as \"Raksha\" (2008).\n\nSridher was a self made millionaire, working as one of the directors of a multi national company. He was happily married to Sharada and lives in a peaceful neighborhood of Hyderabad. His younger sister Anita and Sharada's mute brother Narayana Rao stay with them. Approximately eight years after their marriage, Sharada conceives and immediately after that Sridher loses his ability to beget a child after an accident. They name their daughter Tulasi and raise her with utmost affection. When Tulasi was six years old, Sridher saves his employer, Richard's grandchild from a fatal accident. Richard later leaves India and arranges that Tulsi will get twenty lakhs (two million) rupees on her tenth birthday. His will says that if she dies before that, money would go to an orphanage run by Chidananda Swami.\n\nSridher's company plans to send him along with his family to Paris to help their business there and Sridher happily agrees.

{"id": "1404732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1404732", "title": "Vocabulary development", "text": "Vocabulary development\n\nVocabulary development is a process by which people acquire words. Babbling shifts towards meaningful speech as infants grow and produce their first words around the age of one year. In early word learning, infants build their vocabulary slowly. By the age of 18 months, infants can typically produce about 50 words and begin to make word combinations.\n\nIn order to build their vocabularies, infants must learn about the meanings that words carry. The mapping problem asks how infants correctly learn to attach words to referents. Constraints theories, domain-general views, social-pragmatic accounts, and an emergentist coalition model have been proposed to account for the mapping problem...\n\nFrom an early age, infants use language to communicate. Caregivers and other family members use language to teach children how to act in society. In their interactions with peers, children have the opportunity to learn about unique conversational roles. Through pragmatic directions, adults often offer children cues for understanding the meaning of words.\n\nThroughout their school years, children continue to build their vocabulary. In particular, children begin to learn abstract words. Beginning around age 3–5, word learning takes place both in conversation and through reading. Word learning often involves physical context, builds on prior knowledge, takes place in social context, and includes semantic support. The phonological loop and serial order short-term memory may both play an important role in vocabulary development.\n\nInfants begin to understand words such as \"Mommy\", \"Daddy\", \"hands\" and \"feet\" when they are approximately 6 months old. Initially, these words refer to their own mother or father or hands or feet. Infants begin to produce their first words when they are approximately one year old. Infants' first words are normally used in reference to things that are of importance to them, such as objects, body parts, people, and relevant actions. Also, the first words that infants produce are mostly single-syllabic or repeated single syllables, such as \"no\" and \"dada\". By 12 to 18 months of age, children's vocabularies often contain words such as \"kitty\", \"bottle\", \"doll\", \"car\" and \"eye\". Children's understanding of names for objects and people usually precedes their understanding of words that describe actions and relationships. \"One\" and \"two\" are the first number words that children learn between the ages of one and two. Infants must be able to hear and play with sounds in their environment, and to break up various phonetic units to discover words and their related meanings.\n\nStudies related to vocabulary development show that children's language competence depends upon their ability to hear sounds during infancy. Infants' perception of speech is distinct. Between six and ten months of age, infants can discriminate sounds used in the languages of the world. By 10 to 12 months, infants can no longer discriminate between speech sounds that are not used in the language(s) to which they are exposed. Among six-month-old infants, seen articulations (i.e. the mouth movements they observe others make while talking) actually enhance their ability to discriminate sounds, and may also contribute to infants' ability to learn phonemic boundaries. Infants' phonological register is completed between the ages of 18 months and 7 years.\n\nChildren's phonological development normally proceeds as follows:\n\n6–8 weeks: Cooing appears\n\n16 weeks: Laughter and vocal play appear\n\n6–9 months: Reduplicated (canonical) babbling appears\n\n12 months: First words use a limited sound repertoire\n\n18 months: Phonological processes (deformations of target sounds) become systematic\n\n18 months–7 years: Phonological inventory completion\n\nAt each stage mentioned above, children play with sounds and learn methods to help them learn words. There is a relationship between children's prelinguistic phonetic skills and their lexical progress at age two: failure to develop the required phonetic skills in their prelinguistic period results in children's delay in producing words. Environmental influences may affect children's phonological development, such as hearing loss as a result of ear infections. Deaf infants and children with hearing problems due to infections are usually delayed in the beginning of vocal babbling.\n\nBabbling is an important aspect of vocabulary development in infants, since it appears to help practice producing speech sounds. Babbling begins between five and seven months of age. At this stage, babies start to play with sounds that are not used to express their emotional or physical states, such as sounds of consonants and vowels. Babies begin to babble in real syllables such as \"ba-ba-ba, neh-neh-neh, and dee-dee-dee,\" between the ages of seven and eight months; this is known as canonical babbling. Jargon babbling includes strings of such sounds; this type of babbling uses intonation but doesn't convey meaning. The phonemes and syllabic patterns produced by infants begin to be distinctive to particular languages during this period (e.g., increased nasal sounds in French and Japanese babies) though most of their sounds are similar. There is a shift from babbling to the use of words as the infant grows.\n\nAs children get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By the age of eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from an early stage of slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth is referred to as the \"vocabulary spurt\". Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as \"no bye-bye\" and \"more please\". Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using \"and\". This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. In one study of 38 children, only five of the children had an inflection point in their rate of word acquisition as opposed to a quadratic growth. This study suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.\n\nIn word learning, the mapping problem refers to the question of how infants attach the forms of language to the things that they experience in the world. There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world that words could be mapped onto. Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.\n\nWhile domain-specific accounts of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue that word learning can be accounted for by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language. Yet other theorists have proposed social pragmatic accounts, which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word learning process. According to some research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still play an important role in this process. Recently, an emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.\n\nTheories of word-learning constraints argue for biases or default assumptions that guide the infant through the word learning process. Constraints are outside of the infant's control and are believed to help the infant limit their hypotheses about the meaning of words that they encounter daily. Constraints can be considered domain-specific (unique to language).\n\nCritics argue that theories of constraints focus on how children learn nouns, but ignore other aspects of their word learning. Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden because they are not utilized in adult language. For instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, when referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate the mutual exclusivity constraint.\n\nBelow, the most prominent constraints in the literature are detailed:\n\nDomain-general views of vocabulary development argue that children do not need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word-world mappings. Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as salience, association, and frequency. Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are most salient in context, and then to associate them with the words that are most frequently used in their presence. Additionally, research on word learning suggests that fast mapping, the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a time delay.\n\nDomain-general views have been criticized for not fully explaining how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.\n\nSocial pragmatic theories, also in contrast to the constraints view, focus on the social context in which the infant is embedded. According to this approach, environmental input removes the ambiguity of the word learning situation. Cues such as the caregiver's gaze, body language, gesture, and smile help infants to understand the meanings of words. Social pragmatic theories stress the role of the caregiver in talking about objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.\n\nJoint attention is an important mechanism through which children learn to map words-to-world, and vice versa. Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint attention is often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment. As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention. Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors, who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to in the world at the same time. The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the Kaluli, a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels in the context of their referents. While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the meaning-making process, some theorists argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning, actively avoiding mapping errors. When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-referent mappings. Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.\n\nFrom early on, children also assume that language is designed for communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term that everyone in the community would expect to be used. According to contrast, infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.\n\nThe emergentist coalition model suggests that children make use of multiple cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object. The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social, perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic cues. While a range of cues are available from the start of word learning, it may be the case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process. While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues, older, more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues. For instance, young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience, but older children attend to the gaze of caregivers and use the focus of caregivers to direct their word mapping. Therefore, this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning, but the use of a wide range of cues develops over time.\n\nSupporters of the emergentist coalition model argue that, as a hybrid, this model moves towards a more holistic explanation of word learning that is not captured by models with a singular focus. For instance, constraints theories typically argue that constraints/principles are available to children from the onset of word learning, but do not explain how children develop into expert speakers who are not limited by constraints. Additionally, some argue that domain-general perspectives do not fully address the question of how children sort through numerous potential referents in order to correctly sort out meaning. Lastly, social pragmatic theories claim that social encounters guide word learning. Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners, they seem to tell us little about children's capacities at the start of word learning. According to its proponents, the emergentist coalion model incorporates constraints/principles, but argues for the development and change in these principles over time, while simultaneously taking into consideration social aspects of word learning alongside other cues, such as salience.\n\nBoth linguistic and socio-cultural factors affect the rate at which vocabulary develops. Children must learn to use their words appropriately and strategically in social situations. They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others in a wide variety of interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations. Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.\n\nChildren use words differently for objects, spatial relations and actions. Children ages one to three often rely on general purpose deictic words such as \"here\", \"that\" or \"look\" accompanied by a gesture, which is most often pointing, to pick out specific objects. Children also stretch already known or partly known words to cover other objects that appear similar to the original. This can result in word \"overextension\" or misuses of words. Word overextension is governed by the perceptual similarities children notice among the different referents. Misuses of words indirectly provide ways of finding out which meanings children have attached to particular words. When children come into contact with spatial relations, they talk about the location of one object with respect to another. They name the object located and use a deictic term, such as \"here\" or \"there\" for location, or they name both the object located and its location. They can also use a general purpose locative marker, which is a preposition, postposition or suffix depending on the language that is linked in some way to the word for location. Children's earliest words for actions usually encode both the action and its result. Children use a small number of general purpose verbs, such as \"do\" and \"make\" for a large variety of actions because their resources are limited. Children acquiring a second language seem to use the same production strategies for talking about actions. Sometimes children use a highly specific verb instead of a general purpose verb. In both cases children stretch their resources to communicate what they want to say.\n\nInfants use words to communicate early in life and their communication skills develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as \"then\", \"so\", and \"because\" are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.\n\nCaregivers use language to help children become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, and how they can stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.\n\nFamily members contribute to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack the capacity to acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings. There are limitations to studies that focus on the influences of fathers and siblings, as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.\n\nPeers help expose children to multi-party conversations. This allows children to hear a greater variety of speech, and to observe different conversational roles. Peers may be uncooperative conversation partners, which pressures the children to communicate more effectively. Speaking to peers is different from speaking to adults, but children may still correct their peers. Peer interaction provides children with a different experience filled with special humour, disagreements and conversational topics.\n\nCulture and context in infants’ linguistic environment shape their vocabulary development. English learners have been found to map novel labels to objects more reliably than to actions compared to Mandarin learners. This early noun bias in English learners is caused by the culturally reinforced tendency for English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of ostensive labelling as well as noun-friendly activities such as picture book reading. Adult speech provides children with grammatical input. Both Mandarin and Cantonese languages have a category of grammatical function word called a noun classifier, which is also common across many genetically unrelated East Asian languages. In Cantonese, classifiers are obligatory and specific in more situations than in Mandarin. This accounts for the research found on Mandarin-speaking children outperforming Cantonese-speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary.\n\nPragmatic directions provide children with additional information about the speaker's intended meaning. Children's learning of new word meanings is guided by the pragmatic directions that adults offer, such as explicit links to word meanings. Adults present young children with information about how words are related to each other through connections, such as \"is a part of\", \"is a kind of\", \"belongs to\", or \"is used for\". These pragmatic directions provide children with essential information about language, allowing them to make inferences about possible meanings for unfamiliar words. This is also called inclusion. When children are provided with two words related by inclusion, they hold on to that information. When children hear an adult say an incorrect word, and then repair their mistake by stating the correct word, children take into account the repair when assigning meanings to the two words.\n\nVocabulary development during the school years builds upon what the child already knows, and the child uses this knowledge to broaden his or her vocabulary. Once children have gained a level of vocabulary knowledge, new words are learned through explanations using familiar, or \"old\" words. This is done either explicitly, when a new word is defined using old words, or implicitly, when the word is set in the context of old words so that the meaning of the new word is constrained. When children reach school-age, context and implicit learning are the most common ways in which their vocabularies continue to develop. By this time, children learn new vocabulary mostly through conversation and reading. Throughout schooling and adulthood, conversation and reading are the main methods in which vocabulary develops. This growth tends to slow once a person finishes schooling, as they have already acquired the vocabulary used in everyday conversation and reading material and generally are not engaging in activities that require additional vocabulary development.\n\nDuring the first few years of life, children are mastering concrete words such as \"car\", \"bottle\", \"dog\", \"cat\". By age 3, children are likely able to learn these concrete words without the need for a visual reference, so word learning tends to accelerate around this age. Once children reach school-age, they learn abstract words (e.g. \"love\", \"freedom\", \"success\"). This broadens the vocabulary available for children to learn, which helps to account for the increase in word learning evident at school age. By age 5, children tend to have an expressive vocabulary of 2,100–2,200 words. By age 6, they have approximately 2,600 words of expressive vocabulary and 20,000–24,000 words of receptive vocabulary. Some claim that children experience a sudden acceleration in word learning, upwards of 20 words per day, but it tends to be much more gradual than this. From age 6 to 8, the average child in school is learning 6–7 words per day, and from age 8 to 12, approximately 12 words per day.\n\nExposure to conversations and engaging in conversation with others help school-age children develop vocabulary. Fast mapping is the process of learning a new concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by infants and toddlers, but by preschool children and adults as well. This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly in conversation, but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.\n\nReading is considered to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. When a child begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.\n\nGenerally, both conversation and reading involve at least one of the four principles of context that are used in word learning and vocabulary development: physical context, prior knowledge, social context and semantic support.\n\nPhysical context involves the presence of an object or action that is also the topic of conversation. With the use of physical context, the child is exposed to both the words and a visual reference of the word. This is frequently used with infants and toddlers, but can be very beneficial for school-age children, especially when learning rare or infrequently used words. Physical context may include props such as in toy play. When engaging in play with an adult, a child's vocabulary is developed through discussion of the toys, such as naming the object (e.g. \"dinosaur\") or labeling it with the use of a rare word (e.g., \"stegosaurus\"). These sorts of interactions expose the child to words they may not otherwise encounter in day-to-day conversation.\n\nPast experiences or general knowledge is often called upon in conversation, so it is a useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word \"elephant\", an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word \"elephant\" to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.\n\nSocial context involves pointing out social norms and violations of these norms. This form of context is most commonly found in conversation, as opposed to reading or other word learning environments. A child's understanding of social norms can help them to infer the meaning of words that occur in conversation. In an English-speaking tradition, \"please\" and \"thank you\" are taught to children at a very early age, so they are very familiar to the child by school-age. For example, if a group of people is eating a meal with the child present and one person says, \"give me the bread\" and another responds with, \"that was rude. What do you say?\", and the person responds with \"please\", the child may not know the meaning of \"rude\", but can infer its meaning through social context and understanding the necessity of saying \"please\".\n\nSemantic support is the most obvious method of vocabulary development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information of the meaning of a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra for the first time and ask, \"what is that?\" and the parent might respond, \"that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it\".\n\nPictures support involves two memory techniques – association and visualization. Associating an image with a word helps a user learn word in a more effective way. Anshul Agarwal, Founder of dailyvocab.com mentioned in his interview to Career360 – \"memory aid for each word help student learn words more faster and effectively\".\n\nMemory plays an important role in vocabulary development, however the exact role that it plays is disputed in the literature. Specifically, short-term memory and how its capacities work with vocabulary development is questioned by many researchers.\n\nThe phonology of words has proven to be beneficial to vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that they already know to learn new words. The phonological loop encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities in the area of phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 and adolescence), so does an individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.\n\nSerial-order short-term memory may be critical to the development of vocabulary. As lexical knowledge increases, phonological representations have to become more precise to determine the differences between similar sound words (i.e. \"calm\", \"come\"). In this theory, the specific order or sequence of phonological events is used to learn new words, rather than phonology as a whole.\n\n\n"}
