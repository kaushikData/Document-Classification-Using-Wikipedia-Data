It originally aired on March 6, 2014, on NBC. The episode was written by Jordan Blum and Parker Deay, and directed by Rob Schrab. The episode marked the series writing debut of Blum and Deay, and the second episode in the series which Schrab directed.\n\nThe episode was met with generally positive reviews, with many commenting on the original homages to \"Zardoz\" and \"Logan's Run\"; however, despite positive reviews from critics, the episode matched the previous week's ratings with a 1.0 in the 18–49 rating/share, though it improved to 2.79 million viewers – up from 2.56 million viewers the previous week.\n\nShirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) discovers that Jeff (Joel McHale) has organized a dinner with the study group without inviting her, which causes a small argument between the two. Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) interrupts the conversation and introduces two app designers to the study group. Dean Pelton reveals that he is allowing the app designers to beta test their new social networking application, MeowMeowBeenz, using the Greendale staff and students. MeowMeowBeenz allows the user to rate a person between 1 and 5 MeowMeowBeenz.\n\nThe app soon becomes extremely popular at Greendale, but Jeff and Britta (Gillian Jacobs) continue to reject it. Britta attempts to convince people of the app's stupidity, but is unable to get people to listen to her unless she has mustard on her face, which Annie (Alison Brie) says distracts from Britta's intensity. Jeff eventually caves in and joins the app, after discovering that Shirley has 5 MeowMeowBeenz, which makes her extremely popular amongst everyone on campus and also gives her the ability to influence what people rate others. The campus soon deteriorates into a dystopia, with the Fives and Fours controlling the school, the Threes and Twos serving them, and the Ones being exiled from the school. The group of Fives, made up of Shirley, Abed (Danny Pudi), Chang (Ken Jeong), Hickey (Jonathan Banks) and a party animal named Koogler (Mitch Hurwitz), realize that the Threes and Twos are becoming suspicious of them, and decide to host a talent show in order to give them hope. Meanwhile, Jeff, who is now a Four, conspires with Britta to enter the talent show and take down the Fives by exposing their oppressive regime.\n\nJeff performs at the talent show, but instead of exposing the Fives' regime, performs a hilarious comedy act, which gets him voted into the Fives. With her and Jeff's plan ruined, Britta attempts to expose the regime herself, but no one will listen to her. Britta eventually puts mustard on her face, which causes everyone to pay attention to her and agree to revolt against the Fives. Meanwhile, Jeff is initiated into the Fives, but an argument between him and Shirley causes both of them to be voted down to Ones, and exiled from the school. Outside the school, both Jeff and Shirley admit that they became obsessed by the app, and apologize to each other. Jeff and Shirley are eventually let back into the school, and discover that Britta has overthrown the Fives and replaced their regime with her own oppressive regime, where everyone is a One. Jeff reveals to the school that the app's beta test ended 8 days ago and convinces everyone at the school to delete the app. With the app deleted, everyone leaves the school, leaving a powerless Britta alone. The next week, everyone returns to school and the Dean asks that everyone forget the experience, while Jeff and Shirley mend their relationship.\n\nUpon airing, episode was watched by 2.79 million American viewers, and received an 18-49 rating/share of 1.0/3. The show placed fourth in its time-slot, behind \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"American Idol\", and \"Once Upon a Time in Wonderland\"; and fourteenth for the night.\n\nCritics gave the episode generally positive reviews for its ambitious parody of a futuristic dystopia created because of a social media application. The criticism, however, for the episode came for being \"messy\" and taking narrative shortcuts that may have detracted from the story. Todd VanDerWerff of \"The A.V. Club\" rated the episode a \"B\" and wrote that the episode felt like the writers \"had one good idea somewhere, and then a bunch of other ideas piled on top of it, and, hey, we can get a lot of big stars to appear, so why not? And eventually, the finished product had so much going on that you couldn’t tell what the original impetus for making the movie was in the first place.\"\n\nVanDerWerff said that it was \"probably the weakest episode of the season\" despite having a lot of big ideas, some of it wildly funny and impressively original. He said the episode functioned well as a social commentary on \"the ways we try to make ourselves look better on Facebook, Twitter, and the Internet in general\". The episode worked on a pure plot and character level, wrote VanDerWerff, in exposing our desire to be liked and admired by projecting facsimiles of ourselves in different social media platforms, while subconsciously accepting that those are the versions we want the world to see. \"We are, in some sense, reducing ourselves to fictional characters, less susceptible to pain or anger, at least until people needle at us, and we act as if that needling is directly attacking our core selves, instead of just some projection we’ve made to get more popular online.\"\n\nGabrielle Moss of \"TVFanatic\", on the other hand, rated the episode 4.8 out of 5 stars, and relished how a social media app transformed Greendale into \"one of the season's most delightful fits of whimsy\". Moss wrote how the episode spoofs how we are one \"poke\" way from a fascist nightmare, with wise elders making Starburns run around dressed like the protagonist-enforcer from the film \"Zardoz\". Moss maintained that even though this episode \"certainly didn't compare to Abed and Hickey's knock-down fight about the meaning of emotions and selfishness in Episode 7, Abed's argument – in favor of social networking's capacity to carefully quantify social interaction for the socially maladjusted – was one of the more persuasive explanations in favor of social networking that I've heard.\" She wrote how using a \"1970s retro-futuristic sci-fi style\" was a great way to prove what \"appeared on the surface to be an epic take-down of social networking, proves that the episode was actually a takedown of that evergreen topic, human vanity and greed\". She opined that the Community Season 5 is at the show's peak, especially in portraying Britta as \"a socialist revolutionary-cum-warlord,\" and seeing the \"show bloom into the complicated, deranged flower that we planted five seasons ago.\" But it's not all sunshine and deranged flowers, Moss wrote: \"If Community Season 5 has a theme, it's about how we can all become villains without realizing it, even as we see ourselves as victims in our own stories. The removal of Pierce and the reformation of Chang has left a villainy vacancy at Greendale, and this season, everyone – Shirley is this episode, Abed and Hickey last week, Britta in Community Season 5 Episode 5 – seems to be trying on the crown...and everyone is finding that it fits.\"\n\nBrian Collins of \"Badass Digest\" rated the episode a \"B+\" and wrote how Community is great at swinging between a high-concept episode this week after a toned-down episode the previous week without giving its fans whiplash. Collins wrote how this was a strong episode for Britta, who had been sidelined in the first few episodes: \"[Britta] suddenly sounds more reasonable when she has mustard on the corner of her lip ('It dilutes or distracts from your excessive intensity,' Annie explains), which of course leads to the actress tossing whatever vanity she may have aside in service of a sight gag where she tries to boost her control over her audience by smearing it over her entire face.\"\n\nBen Umstead of \"Twitch Film\" gave a mixed review, saying how the episode displayed \"interesting experiments in homage, but it was one experiment that didn't fully land\". Umstead wrote how the episode started personally and intimately through an emotional rift between Shirley and Jeff, going \"on and off the rails so many times that it was merely close to, but never quite a disaster,\" and ending with some real meaning between the two. Umstead praised the episode's homage \"to many a Sci-fi flick from the 70s, most notably \"Zardoz\" and \"Logan's Run\", and of course there's a bit of H. G. Wells style future from \"The Time Machine\"\". Umstead also praised the performance of the \"professional party animal named Koogler (played wonderfully silly by \"Arrested Development\" creator Mitch Hurwitz)\" reigning as a 5 along with Shirley and getting his own \"Animal House\"-themed trailer in the end credits. But the episode pushed the plot forward at the expense of jokes: \"So much of what works or doesn't will rely on your knowledge of dystopic satires or how much you enjoy seeing comedians Tim Heidecker, Eric Wareheim, and Jen Kirkman as disco-angel stylized 4s.\" He writes how the episode is \"serviceable\" because it \"goes so deep in the well of Community emotional tropes, as to then feel a little lazy in execution. It means well, but it also doesn't help that the basic dystopic ideas it homages and satirizes have been so overly homaged and satirized already as prerequisites for dystopic fiction anyway as to feel stale... if cute in a way.\" Umstead pokes fun at his own review, ending by saying, \"Maybe I should just take a lesson from Koogler and... assume the party!\"\n\n\n"}

Its design was inspired by the architectural style of buildings within the Monte-Carlo Casino, particularly l'Opéra de Monte-Carlo. The society (known as the Summer Center for Public Gatherings prior to 1936) was originally organized as a club for the wealthy of Baku, who attended it for banquets and entertainment. During the Russian Civil War it served as a place for public rallies. In 1936, the club was reorganized into a residence for the Philharmonic society aimed at promoting Azerbaijani classical and folk music. On 11 August 1937 after the building underwent renovation it was named after composer Muslim Magomayev.\n\nIn 1995, the hall was closed down for the more than 8 years for another renovation. However no restoration works were performed for the most part of that period, much to the discontent of many residents of Baku. Azerbaijan's Minister of Culture explained such delay by the fact that underground waters had damaged the base of the building over time. Nevertheless, there were reports (mainly in the opposition media) that the money provided for the renovation by the government or donated by various prominent musicians (such as Mstislav Rostropovich, a Baku native) was largely misappropriated by the bureaucrats and officials who were in charge of funding the project. It was not until November 2002 that the restoration works resumed due to President Heydar Aliyev's special decree. The opening of the fully renovated building took place on 27 January 2004. The opening ceremony of the newly-renovated building was held on January 27, 2004. Several famous people attended the ceremony like President Ilham Aliyev, former minister of culture Polad Bulbuloglu, outstanding cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, professor Ferhad Badalbayli.\n\nThe main building consists of the Summer Hall (1100 seats) and the Winter Hall (610 seats) joined by a single stage.

{"id": "4495160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4495160", "title": "Black Stump", "text": "Black Stump\n\nThe Australian expression 'black stump' is the name for an imaginary point beyond which the country is considered remote or uncivilised, an abstract marker of the limits of established settlement. The origin of the expression, especially in its evolved use as an imaginary marker in the landscape, is contested. The various claims are discussed below.\n\nThe term \"Black stump\" was used as land markers on a surveyors plan and was first referred to as a boundary marker in a New South Wales court case involving a land law dispute. See R v West [1831] NSWSupC 66 (12 October 1831). The case refers to vacant land at Woolloomooloo where a surveyor had difficulty in ascertaining the boundaries as he could not find a plan from the days of Governor Lachlan Macquarie. In the case it stated, \"...and he pointed to some old stumps, which he said had been marked...defendant would not admit that the cross line marked by me on the plan was not part of his boundary...he said it ran to a black stump beyond the line, which he said had been marked...; he said the line was to run somewhere thereabouts; utmost extent claimed by defendant was the black stump of which I have spoken...made no claims beyond South Head road...\"\n\nOne theory states that the expression derives from the use of black stumps in the landscape as markers when directing travellers. Other explanations relate to historical events associated with places or geographical features with names incorporating the phrase \"black stump\". At least three regional Australian towns claim the expression originated in their general vicinity.\n\nThe term 'black stump' is used in various formulations. The most common are:\n\n\nAnother use of the phrase ‘black stump’ in the Australian vernacular, which relates more to the real object than an abstract concept of landscape, is the local term for the old State Office Block in Sydney (now demolished). The high-rise building was dark-grey in colour and Sydney residents – “with the local talent for belittling anything that embarrassed them with its pretensions” – dubbed it ‘the Black Stump’.\n\nThe most prosaic explanation for the origin of ‘black stump’ derives from the general use of fire-blackened tree-stumps as markers when giving directions to travellers unfamiliar with the terrain. An early use of the phrase from the Sydney journal \"Bulletin\" (31 March 1900, p. 31) seems to lend support to this explanation: “A rigmarole of details concerning the turns and hollows, the big tree, the dog-leg fence, and the black stump”.\n\nRobbery Under Arms, a fictionalised work by Rolf Boldrewood first published in 1888, refers to the Black Stump as an actual place \"within a reasonable distance of Bathurst\" and known to everybody for miles around. Boldrewood says it \"had been a tremendous old Ironbark tree- nobody knew how old, but it had had its top blown off in a thunderstorm, and the carriers had lighted so many fires against the roots of it that it had been killed at last, and the sides were as black as a steamer's funnel.\"\n\nRaffaello Carboni used the phrase 'black-stump' in his account of the Eureka Stockade uprising which he wrote in 1855, probably referring to a well-worn pipe: \"Please, give me a dozen puffs at my black-stump, and then I will proceed to the next chapter\". There appears to be no obvious link between the use of the phrase by Carboni and the expression being used as an imaginary marker in the landscape.\n\nThe evolution of meaning of the phrase 'black stump', from the real to an imaginary marker of landscape, probably occurred during the nineteenth century. There is a widespread belief that the expression took root amongst carriers or teamsters that operated in the regional districts of Australia. Carriers were an integral part of the rural economy during the nineteenth century; they transported wool and supplies by drays drawn by horse- or bullock-teams, travelling constantly across the landscape servicing stations and settlements distant from regional transport hubs and urban centres.\n\nIf the use of the expression 'black stump' entered the Australian vernacular in the nineteenth century, it rarely appeared in Australian literature or newspaper reports until the twentieth century. \nAt least three towns in regional Australia claim to be home to \"the\" 'black stump': Coolah, NSW; Merriwagga and Gunbar in NSW; and Blackall in Queensland.\n\nThe area just north of present-day Coolah was known by local Aborigines as 'Weetalibah-Wallangan', apparently meaning \"place where the fire went out and left a burnt stump\". In an attempt to control the settlement patterns of the colony of New South Wales Governor Darling issued regulations in 1829 limiting settlement in the colony to land within the Nineteen Counties surrounding Sydney. The regulations defined the \"limits of location\", and it is claimed this boundary passed \"along the approximate location of the Black Stump Run\" (located just north-west of present-day Coolah). Land to the north of this part of Governor Darling's boundary (it is asserted) began to be described as \"beyond the Black Stump\".\n\nThis raises the question: had the Black Stump Run been taken up by 1829 (or at least by the mid-1830s)? Darling’s “limits of location” was a short-lived concept; in 1836 Governor Bourke allowed individuals occupying lands beyond the Nineteen Counties to obtain annual licenses to legitimise their activities and the \"limits of location\" became officially irrelevant.\n\nIn a list of persons who obtained licences to depasture stock beyond the limits of location in the district of Bligh for the year ending 30 June 1847 appears the entry \"Launt Joseph ... The Black Stump\". Archival research may produce earlier references.\n\nIn May 1851 a notice was published by James M’Cubbin of Coolah, warning against trespassing by cattle or persons on his run “THE BLACK STUMP” in the district of Bligh. \n\nBy 1885, the Black Stump run had been consolidated with the Queensborough run into the Queensborough Pastoral Holding of some 46,000 acres. The name lived on in local usage, and there are currently three place names in the vicinity of the original run approved by the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales, i.e. Black Stump Graveyard/Cemetery, Black Stump Creek and Black Stump Resting Place.\n\nApparently a teamster named John Higgins took up land in the vicinity of the Black Stump Run (possibly in the early 1860s when Robertson's Land Bills allowed land selection to occur). Higgins built an inn in the 1860s which he called The Black Stump Inn, located at the junction of roads leading to Gunnedah and Coonabarabran. The inn later became the Black Stump Wine Saloon and was destroyed by fire in 1908. It has been suggested that the saloon was an important staging post for traffic to north-west New South Wales and it became a marker by which people gauged their journeys.\n\nThe village of Merriwagga and nearby community of Gunbar, in the Riverina district of New South Wales, have strong claims to the origin of the expression 'black stump'. Gunbar cemetery is the burial-place of Mrs. Barbara Blain, the woman whose accidental death in March 1886 possibly gave rise to the term.\n\nBarbara Blain's husband, James, was a carrier or teamster, based at Hay. In March 1886 James and Barbara Blain, in company with other carriers, stopped to camp at a pine ridge on \"Gunbar\" station. James and the other men left to load posts onto their drays and Barbara began preparations for the evening meal. When they returned, the men found Mrs. Blain had been fatally burnt, probably after her dress had caught alight from the flames of the camp-fire. Barbara Blain was buried at nearby Gunbar cemetery and an inquest into her death was subsequently held. James Blain apparently stated that when he found his wife she \"looked like a black stump\" (possibly as part of his evidence at the inquest). A watering place near where the tragedy occurred – roughly halfway between Gunbar and the village of Merriwagga – became known as Black Stump Tank.\n\nThe Black Stump Picnic area at Merriwagga has a waggon and memorial stone, with an inscription which explains the details of these events.\n\nThe town of Blackall, Queensland makes the following claim to the origin of the expression. In 1887 a group of surveyors arrived in Blackall (near the centre of Queensland, over 1,000 kilometres west of Brisbane) and established an Astro Station on this site to conduct survey readings to establish a principal meridional circuit traverse around the town. Stumps and other suitable stable platforms were often used rather than a set of legs because they gave more stability to the heavy theodolites then used to take longitudinal and latitudinal observations.\n\nThis Astro station was used as part of the survey to fix the position of principal towns extending from Brisbane to Boulia via Roma, Charleville and Blackall and enabled the mapping of Queensland on a more accurate basis.\n\nIt was considered at the time that country to the west of Blackall was beyond the 'black stump'.\n\nA stump of petrified wood which marks the location of the original Astro Station is found at the monument near Blackall State School. This petrified stump replaces the original blackened timber stump destroyed by fire.\n\n'Beyond the Black Stump' is a syndicated cartoon strip, featuring Australian native animals as characters. It is published in papers across Australia including \"The Courier-Mail\" in Brisbane, Queensland. See their web site for more information (including some strips and characters).\n\nThe Black Stump Music and Arts Festival was a four-day Christian festival that is held in the Greater Sydney Metropolitan region over the Labour Day long weekend, often the first weekend in October, from 1985 to 2014.\n\nIn Adelaide, the Grenfell Centre, the city's third tallest building, is nicknamed \"the black stump\".\n\nA restaurant chain has also flourished under the same name, serving popular Australian food, with branches forming as far away as Hong Kong.\n\nIn England Laithwaite Wines market a durif/shiraz blend from Casella Wines called \"Black Stump\".\n\n\n"}

It was published by Hodder and Stoughton in 2006. It took her seven years to write the novel where she was \"intrigued by the idea of these medieval warrior monks\".\n\nThe novel describes the fictional story of a young teenager by the name of William Campbell who starts out as a sergeant and later is promoted to a full Knight Templar. He is tasked with the search of the Book of the Grail which, if ever in the wrong hands, could potentially result in the downfall of not only the Anima Templi (a secret order within the Temple), but also the Temple itself. However, Will finds he's not alone in the search of the book. There are also Prince Edward and The Order of the St John's or the Hospitallers who want the Book as part of their plans to bring down the Temple.\n\nThe story of Will Campbell runs parallel to that of Baybars Bundukdari, a slave who rose to become Sultan of the Mamluks motivated purely by his hatred of the Franks. In the earlier parts of the story, Will does not know that his father James Campbell is also part of the Anima Templi (or Brethren) and that there is a contact deep within Baybars' circle of trusted advisors who works with the Brethren to achieve long-lasting peace in the Holy land and the reconciliation of the three dominant faiths of the West: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\n\nThe book has a sequel written by the same author. \"Crusade\" follows Will as he becomes further entangled in the Brethren and Baybars.\n\nThe following characters in the book were real historical figures:\n\nThe book received a mixed reception from reviewers. In a positive review, \"Publishers Weekly\" opined that the novel combines \"rich historical detail, clever plotting and engaging characters\" to \"craft a historical thriller that will have readers turning pages and envisioning the sequel.\". John Washburn, of on-line review site \"My Shelf\" praised Young's \"steely depictions\" of the action in the novel; her \"silky style\"; and her \"engaging story filled with mystery, romance, courage, abandonment and deception.\". Marie D. Jones, in a review for \"Curled Up\" commented that \"you would think Young lived during the times she seems to grasp so well\" and found the novel \"an exciting read\". Stephen Hubbard, writing for \"Book Reporter\", praised Young's \"perfectly crafted\" characters, \"the strength of her narrative\" in a mainly positive review, stating \"The majesty, brutality and romanticism of that time are so beautifully painted on the page that it is often difficult to separate the fact from the fiction, and we as readers are dropped into the very center of history to experience the events from within.\". Hubbard did, however, comment that he felt the novel sometimes supplied an \"overload of information\", though \"these moments are extremely few and easily can be forgiven considering the strength of the remainder of the work.\".\n\nEleanor Bukowsky of on-line reviewers \"Mostly Fiction\", offered a more critical opinion of the novel. She states that \"although she has the history part down pat, Young is less skilled in creating three-dimensional and believable characters. Her villains are dastardly and her young heroes are callow and long-suffering.\" and felt that \"the book meanders a bit and the finale takes a long time to play out.\". The novel was negatively reviewed by \"Boomtron\", with the reviewer stating that the characters \"sound awfully modern\" and are \"too aware of their history and that of other nations\", given that \"studying such matters was a luxury few could afford\". In addition, the reviewer also criticised the novels levels of historical detail, stating that they found the \"history lessons superfluous, out of character and quite annoying interruptions in the story.\". The review did end on a more positive note, however, with the reviewer saying that \"Young has written an engaging story at one level or I wouldn’t have suffered through 600 pages of it\" and praising Larry Rostant's cover art.\n"}

They have been part of the culture of the \"Porteños\" (inhabitants of Buenos Aires) since the beginnings of the 20th century.\n\nThe \"filetes\" were born as simple ornaments, becoming an emblematic form of art for the city.\nMany of its initiators were European immigrants, who brought from Europe some elements or art, that were mixed with the local tradition, creating a very typical Argentine style.\nThe fileteado was recognized as an art after 1970, when it was exhibited for the first time.\n\nFileteado began in the gray carts pulled by horses, that transported fruits, milk, groceries and bread at the end of the 19th century.\n\nThe painter who decorated the karts was called \"Fileteador\", because he performed the job with long-threaded paintbrushes also called \"Brushes for making filetes\". This is a word derived from Latin \"Filum\" which means \"Thread\", referring to the art in a fine line that serves as ornament.\n\nSince it was something that was executed after a kart was done, but before the payment was received, it was a task that had to be performed quickly.\n\nAt that time, many specialist painters surged such as Ernesto Magiori and Pepe Aguado or artists such as Miguel Venturo, son of Salvador Venturo. This last one had been a captain of the Merchant Navy of Italy who established in Buenos Aires, where he dedicated to Fileteado, incorporating a lot of motifs from his home country. Miguel studied painting and enhanced his father's technique, being considered by many the painter who shaped the Filete. The introduction of birds, flowers, diamonds and dragons in the motifs is attributed to him, as well as the design of letters in the doors of trucks. Since there was a tax imposed to very big letters, Miguel made smaller ones but surrounded by very colorful and complex designs to draw attention, design that stood for a long time.\n\nIn the book \"Filete porteño\", by Alfredo Genovese, the anthropologist Norberto Cirio describes the main formal features from \"fileteado\" as:\n\nFor a modern example of its use, see the cover of the 2005 album \"Haughty Melodic\" by Mike Doughty.\n\n"}

It has two main areas of focus: popular culture (based on a dialogue between traditional, regional culture and creative innovation) and world music. It has been held every year since 1998 and has become a setting for exchange professionals that sell and buy productions.\n\nMost activities are open to the public at large and the Fira uses a range of stage areas in the city centre. Despite this, activities exclusively aimed at industry professionals are a cornerstone of the Fira. These include industry conferences, a recruitment place, partnership network meetings and presentations. Together with FiràTarrega (the international market for performing arts), Mercat de Música Viva de Vic (Vic live music market), the Sismòfraf d'Olot, the Mostra d'Igualada and the Fira Trapezi, the Fira Mediterrània completes the Generalitat (Regional Government) of Catalonia’s map of artistic marketplaces in Catalonia.\n\nFira Mediterrània is part of the Anna Lindh Foundation, the Spanish Performing Arts Trade Fair Coordinator (COFAE), the European Forum of Worldwide Music Festivals (EFWMF), the International Network for Contemporary Performing Arts (IETM) and the Apropa Cultura program.\n\nFira is an interdisciplinary event and the programme covers all artistic languages – visual arts, circus, dance, exhibitions, music, storytelling and theatre. The programmed shows are in different formats - small, medium or large-scale - in venues or in the street, aimed both at adult and at family audiences.\n\n21st edition will be held from 4 to 7 October 2018.\n\nArts projects can be submitted under two main themes:\nFira Business Area is a networking hub for artists, creators, booking agents, cultural agents, public and private institutions, third sector organisations and cultural industry associations. It promotes discussion on new and emerging opportunities from an international perspective, based on themes that include, among others, the relationship between tradition and performing arts, the community, participation, and the benefits to society stemming from cultural initiatives.\n\nFor three days, the Fira Business Area becomes a nerve centre of professional activity, with exhibitions, a professional conference, presentations of cultural projects, showcases, and speed dating and networking events.\n\nAn innovative, enriching aspect of these initiatives is the fact that at the Fira, unlike other forums for debate, some of the projects can also be seen on stage.\n\nProfessional events are not confined exclusively to the dates of Fira Mediterrània. Throughout the year, Fira Mediterrània also organises other activities, such as roundtable debates and a professional conference.\n\nFira Mediterrània has an International and National Plan of Action, which aims to increase the event's scope with new areas of initiative and to renew the main existing agreements. Of noteworthy interest is the Euroregional Heritage and Creation Forum project, approved by the European Union, which consists of three agents from Occitania, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands that work together to exemplify the social, cultural and linguistic areas they have in common. The Plan of Action also includes the consolidation of agreements with countries such as Germany, Italy, France, Bulgaria, Portugal, Morocco and with regions such as Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Aragon, the Basque Country and Castille and Leon.\n\nFira Mediterrània Manresa-Catalonia is made possible through the Generalitat of Catalonia’s Culture Department and Manresa City Council, which comprise the organising foundation. The main private partner is ‘La Caixa’ Obra Social (Social and Cultural Outreach Project) and the official sponsor is Estrella Damm.\n\n\nFormer and current artistic directors of the Fira Mediterrània Manresa-Catalonia include:\n\n\nThe 'Teresa Rebull' award for the best music production and traditional culture project\n\nThe 'Teresa Rebull' award for the best music production and traditional culture project is announced by the Generalitat (Regional Government) of Catalonia's Culture Department and Fira Mediterrània. The goal of this award is to promote music projects that take traditional and folkloric culture as their creative basis by contributing to the funding of the production process, as far as arrangements, management and staging are concerned, among other aspects.\n\nThe award pays tribute to the career of Teresa Rebull who was a singer, painter and tireless activist of Catalan culture, feminism and Anti-Francoism. She died in April 2015.\n\nRecognition in Bogotá\n\nFira Mediterrània Manresa-Catalonia was recognised by the Colombia Ministry of Culture, the University of Rosario in Bogotá and the Ramon Llull Institute of Catalonia-Baleares as a cultural practice of excellence, at the Cultural Management Conference held in March 2010 as part of the Ibero-American Theatre Festival of Bogatá. The two Catalan speaking regions were invited to take part in this event as guests of honour.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "842804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=842804", "title": "Greaser (subculture)", "text": "Greaser (subculture)\n\nGreasers are a youth subculture that was popularized in the late 1940s and 1950s to 1960s by predominantly working class and lower class teenagers and young adults in the United States. The subculture remained prominent into the mid-1960s and was particularly embraced by certain ethnic groups in urban areas, particularly Italian-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. Rock and roll music, rockabilly and doo-wop were major parts of the culture.\n\nThe word \"greaser\" originated in the 19th century in the United States as a derogatory label for poor laborers, specifically those of Mexican or Italian descent. The term was later used to refer to mechanics. It was not used in writing to refer to the American subculture of the mid-20th century until the mid-1960s, though in this sense it still evoked a pejorative connotation and a relation to machine work. The name was applied to members of the subculture because of their characteristic greased-back hair.\n\nThe greaser subculture may have emerged in the post-World War II era among the motorcycle clubs and gangs of the late 1940s, though it was certainly established by the 1950s. The original greasers were aligned by a feeling of disillusion with American popular culture, either through a lack of economic opportunity in spite of the or a marginalization enacted by the general domestic shift towards homogeneity. Most were male, often ethnic and working-class, and held interest in hotrod culture or motorcycling. A handful of middle class youth were drawn to the subculture for its rebellious attitude.\n\nThe weak structural foundation of the greasers can be attributed to the subculture's origins in working-class youth with few economic resources with which they could participate in American consumerism. Greasers, unlike motorcyclists, did not explicitly have their own interest clubs or publications. As such, there was no business marketing geared specifically towards the group. Their choice in clothing was largely drawn from a common understanding of the empowering aesthetic of working-class attire, rather than cohesive association with similarly-dressed individuals. Some greasers were in motorcycle clubs or in gangs (and some gang members and bikers dressed like greasers) though such membership was not an inherent principle of the subculture.\n\nEthnically, original greasers were mostly composed of Italian Americans in the Northeastern United States and Chicanos in the Southwest. Since both of these peoples were mostly olive-skinned, the \"greaser\" label assumed a quasi-racial status that implied an urban lower class masculinity and delinquency. This development led to an ambiguity in the racial distinction between poor Italian Americans and Puerto Ricans in New York City in the 1950s and 1960s. Greasers were also perceived as being predisposed to perpetrating sexual violence, stoking fear among middle class males and a degree of arousal among middle class females.\n\nThough the television show \"American Bandstand\" helped to \"sanitize\" the negative image of greasers in the 1960s, sexual promiscuity was still seen as a key component of the modern character. By the mid-1970s, the greaser image had become a quintessential part of 1950s nostalgia and cultural revival.\n\nThe most notable physical characteristic of greasers were their greased hair styles through the use of products such as pomade or petroleum jelly. For males, it was used to fashion coiffures such as the Folsom, Pompadour, Elephant's trunk, or Duck's ass. This was probably adopted from early rock 'n' roll and rockabilly\nperformers such as Elvis Presley. Since the hair products weren't sticky and remained wet the hair had to be frequently reshaped via combing so the style could be maintained. For females, backcombing or teasing the hair was common.\n\nMale greasers typically wore loose cotton twill trousers (common among the working class) or dark blue Levi's jeans (widely popular among all American youth in the 1950s). The latter were often cuffed over ankle-high black or brown leather boots, including cowboy, steel-toed engineer, or harness styles. Other footwear choices included Chuck Taylor All-Stars and brothel creepers. Male tops were typically solid black or white T-shirts, ringer T-shirts, or sometimes tank tops (which would have been retailed as underwear). Outerwear were either denim or leather jackets (including but not limited to Perfecto motorcycle jackets). Female greaser dress included leather jackets and risque clothing such as tight and cropped pants like capris and pedal pushers (broadly popular during the time period).\n\nIn the early 1950s there was significant greaser interest in doo-wop, a black genre of music from the industrial cities of the Northeast that had disseminated to mainstream American music through Italian American performers. Greasers were also heavily associated with the culture surrounding rock n' roll, a musical genre which had induced feelings of a moral panic among older, middle class generations during the mid to late 1950s. To many of them, greasers epitomized the connection between rock music and juvenile delinquency professed by several important social and cultural observers at the time.\n\nThe first cinematic representation of the greaser subculture was the 1953 film \"The Wild One\".\n\nGreasers are central characters in the 1957 musical \"West Side Story\" and its 1961 film adaptation, the 1967 novel \"The Outsiders\" and its 1983 film adaptation, the 1974 film \"The Lords of Flatbush\", and the 1979 film \"The Wanderers\". The phenomenon was given a more farcical treatment in the 1971 stage musical \"Grease\" (along with its 1978 film adaptation), which drew its name from the subculture and was based on real-life Chicago Polish greasers in the late 1950s.\n\nThe band Sha-Na-Na models their on-stage presence on New York City greasers (the band members themselves were mostly Ivy Leaguers).\n\n\n"}

At game setup, two seeds are placed in each hole. Each player owns half of the board (2 rows) of the board.\n\nAt his or her turn, the player takes all seeds from a hole and relay-sows them counterclockwise. If there are holes with more than one seed, then the player must sow starting from one such hole. If the last seeds fall in a hole of the inner row and the opposite hole in the opponent's half board is not empty, its contents are captured and removed from the game. If both the opposite hole and that behind it in the opponent's half board are non empty, all seeds are captured from both of them. The game ends when one of the players is left without any seed in his rows.\n\nThe winner of the game is the player who captures most seeds.\n\nThe rules of Bao la Kiarabu were originally transcribed by W. H. Ingrams, who described two variants of the game. One of them is exactly the same as Oman's Hawalis. The other one uses a different board, with 2 rows of 8 holes each (the same board used for Bao). This also differs from Hawalis in that sowing goes clockwise, and that seeds from a hole in the outer row are captured even if the corresponding hole in the inner row is empty.\n\n"}

The 2004 United Nations Arab Human Development Report (AHDR) claims that although Arab-Islamic tradition does hold unique importance for ideas of human welfare, history has proven that \"they were not sufficiently prevalent in society to foster a culture based on a political contract, and allow for the legitimacy of differences of opinion, dialogue and transfer of power.\"\nIssues of the validity of democracy in the region and human rights are at the very centre of the challenges facing Middle Eastern society today.\n\nIn 1948 Egypt, Iran and Pakistan signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Saudi Arabia did not, arguing that it \"failed to take into consideration the cultural and religious context of non-Western countries.\"\n\nThe Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam was adopted by 45 member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in August 1990. This declaration undermines many of the rights the UDHR guarantees allowing all the member states to abide by a set of human rights based on Shari'a law. For example, Article 18 of the UDHR establishes that everyone has the \"right to freedom of religion, freedom to change his religion and freedom to manifest his religion in teaching, practice, worship and observance\". Article 10 of the CDHRI establishes that \"It is prohibited to exercise any form of compulsion on man or to exploit his poverty or ignorance in order to convert him to another religion or to atheism.\"\n\nThe Arab Human Rights Committee, was established in 2009 to oversee compliance with the Arab Charter on Human Rights, which entered into force in March 2017. As of the beginning of October 2009, ten Arab states ratified the Arab Charter on Human Rights. These are: Algeria, Bahrain, Jordan, Libya, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. As of February 2012, another four States ratified the Arab Charter. These were: Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Sudan, and Yemen. The Charter creates a process through which the Committee receives and reviews state reports and makes recommendations as appropriate. The Charter does not provide for a complaints mechanism.\n\nThe Committee has had three sessions during which it has been focusing on \"procedural aspects of organising its work\".\n\nIn regards to capital punishment the countries of the region can be separated into two categories: \nThe death penalty has proven difficult to eradicate in the Middle East due largely to many countries’ legal systems being based around religion, which is more “resistant to change than systems based solely on legislation”. In most countries in the Middle Eastern region, the legal system is largely based primarily on Shari'a. However, Israel's legal system has different sources.\nIn criminal law determined by Shari'a, most crimes classified as Hudud are punishable by death and are considered dangerous for Islamic society. Their punishments are fixed in the Qu´ran and the Hadith. They include adultery, apostasy, armed robbery and rebellion.\nIn 2012, Iran cemented its lead position in the region with two executions per day and Iran continues to execute juvenile prisoners despite its international obligations. \nAccording to studies undertaken by Amnesty International in 2015, at least 1,196 executions were carried out in eight Middle Eastern countries – “a rise of 26% from the 945 executions recorded in eight countries in 2014”. “Iran alone accounted for 82% of all recorded executions in the region and Saudi Arabia executed at least 158 people – a 76% increase on 2014 and the highest number recorded for Saudi Arabia since 1995”.\n\nCapital punishment represents the most dramatic clash between a ‘UN-sponsored’ human rights concept and Shari'a law. Shari'a establishes the death penalty as mandatory punishment for a number of Hudud crimes. “Moreover, some execution methods envisaged in the holy texts, such as flogging, stoning and amputation, violate international conventions that prohibit torture and cruel and inhuman treatments.”\nThe Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), aimed at abolishing the death penalty, was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989. Article 1 of the Protocol states that all the Protocol's Parties shall refrain from carrying out executions and shall take all necessary measures to abolish the death penalty within their jurisdiction. None of the countries in the Middle Eastern region have ratified this protocol, although most have signed and ratified the ICCPR.\n\nIn Egypt, the Constitutional Declaration of March 2011 and the new constitution ratified on December 22, 2011 provide for some freedom of religion, but certain constitutional provisions, laws, and government policies and practices limit that freedom.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, freedom of religion is not recognised nor protected under the law. Sunni Islam is the official religion according to the 1992 Basic Law and the Qur'an and the Sunna are Saudi Arabia’s constitution.\n\nKuwait’s Constitution allows for religious freedom however this is not often put into practice. The government generally enforces the restrictions on freedom of religion established by other laws and policies. Sharia (Islamic law) is the core source of legislation and Islam is the state religion. Both Iraq and Lebanon's governments generally respect religious freedom. It is protected in the constitution and various other laws. In Lebanon “The constitution declares equality of rights and duties for all citizens without discrimination or preference but establishes a balance of power among the major religious groups.” In Iraq Islam is considered the official religion. The constitution instructs that Islam be considered the main source of legislation, and declares that no law may be enacted that contradicts the “established provisions of Islam.”\n\nThe Constitution of Rojava, the \"de facto\" autonomous Federation of Northern Syria – Rojava in Syria formed during the Syrian Civil War, guarantees freedom of religion.\n\nWomen throughout the Middle East earn less than men although there are labour laws in place that dictate equal opportunities for promotion and training and equal pay for the same type of work. These labour laws are frequently violated in regards to not only salary but also benefits such as loans for senior officials or housing allowances. Women in most countries throughout the Middle East can file complaints of discrimination with government agencies but these are often ineffective due to their inability to effectively investigate discrimination cases or impose penalties for employers who violate the labour laws.\n\nIn many countries in the region, labour laws prohibit women from undertaking arduous or dangerous work, or work which could be deemed “detrimental to their health or morals”. Women are prohibited from working at night, with the exception of those employed in medicine and a few other fields. Although these provisions are seen locally as a means of protecting women, in effect they “treat women as minors who are unable to make decisions regarding their own safety and hold women’s guardians responsible if the rules are violated.”.\n\nEducation has been an important area of advancement for women in the region, and is a significant path for their advancement toward wider equality. Since the 1990s, women in the region have made advances in access to literacy, education, university enrolment, and the range of subjects of study available to them. In Saudi Arabia, for example, three educational institutions started to permit women to study law in 2007. However, they remain prohibited from serving as lawyers and judges in court and are only allowed to act as legal consultants to other women.\nDespite these improvements, there are still many barriers to gender equality in education. In majority countries studied, universities largely remain segregated by gender. In Saudi Arabia, for example, the number and diversity of classes offered to men are much greater than those available to women.\n\nNo country in the region (with the sole exception of the defactor autonomous Rojava federation in Syria) offers specific protections against spousal rape or domestic violence however physical abuse is generally prohibited. There is a lack of official protection of rights within the home and a lack of government accountability in these regions. It is believed that most domestic violence is typically covered up and kept within the family as many women in the region feel they cannot discuss their abuse without damaging their own and their family’s reputation and honour.\nAbused women rarely attempt to file complaints with police and when they do they frequently encounter officers who are “reluctant to get involved in what is perceived as a family matter and who encourage reconciliation rather than legal action. In Saudi Arabia in particular, guardianship laws make it very difficult for battered wives to find a safe haven.”.\n\nAll the states in the Middle East region have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). Following the ratification of the CRC, Middle Eastern countries have enacted or proposed to enact laws to protect children from violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation. A number of countries have put in place comprehensive Child Laws that bring together legal provisions for the protection of the child. Egypt, pre 2011 revolution, had been making progress in education, access to vaccines and sanitized water for children. Child labour, violence against girls, gender gaps within education and socioeconomic conditions had continued to be identified as areas of concern. Today, child arrests, detention and imprisonment continue to be a protection risk for children in Egypt. In the second half of 2013, UNICEF estimated that 400 children wound up arrested in connection with political turmoil. Founded in 2000, the Egyptian Foundation for Advancement of Childhood Conditions (EFACC), advocates against children’s abuse and exploitation, advances protections for those in conflict with the law and promotes children’s welfare. EFACC also provides free legal aid to children in trouble.\nBoth external and internal conflict, ongoing political instability and the Syrian refugee crisis remain grave dangers for children in Iraq. The escalating armed conflict with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has placed more children in peril. Multiple aspects of children’s lives are at high risk especially child labour, education, shelter, sexual violence and child recruitment. . Founded in 2005, South Youth Organization (SYO) raises awareness of human rights and works to achieve greater protections for them. SYO exposes and documents grave violations against children, focusing specifically on discrimination issues, sectarian violence and abuse of women and girls. .\n\nSeveral cross-regional programmes and initiatives are supporting Human Rights today, including:\n\n\n\n\nSee the following for more details on each country:\n\n"}

{"id": "10096030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10096030", "title": "Informal education", "text": "Informal education\n\nInformal Education is a general term for education that can occur outside of a structured curriculum. Informal Education encompasses student interests within a curriculum in a regular classroom, but is not limited to that setting. It works through conversation, and the exploration and enlargement of experience. Sometimes there is a clear objective link to some broader plan, but not always. The goal is to provide learners with the tools he or she needs to eventually reach more complex material. It can refer to various forms of alternative education, such as: Unschooling or homeschooling, Autodidacticism (Self-teaching), Youth work, and Informal learning\n\nInformal Education consists of accidental and purposeful ways of collaborating on new information. It can be discussion based and focuses on bridging the gaps between traditional classroom settings and life outside of the classroom.\n\nPeople interpret information differently, and therefore a structured curriculum may not allow all learners to understand the information. Informal education is less controlled than the average classroom setting, which is why informal education can be so powerful. Informal education can help individuals learn to react to and control different situations and settings. In addition, it combines social entities that are important for learning. Informal Education may be viewed as the learning that comes as a part of being involved in youth and community organizations. This type of education is a spontaneous process, which helps people to learn information in a new way. It helps to cultivate communities, associations and relationships that make for a positive learning environment.\n\n\n\n\nInformal Education focuses on values. There is no curriculum or guiding plan for a lot of work.\n\nInformal education has been the practice of indigenous communities in Africa as long as people have lived there. The tradition of African education has long been closely intertwined with the daily life of the African people with the idea that children \"learnt what they lived\". The philosophy of traditional African education suggests that one’s education cannot be separated from the everyday life and the “curriculum” is thus considered “a way of life” with the ultimate goal being to create a \"complete individual, [and] a lifelong learner\". The knowledge and practices that are important to the community are generally passed down through the sharing of memories and participation in cultural activities. Their education system serves as “the information base for the community, which facilitates communication and decision-making”. Similar to other indigenous communities such as the Chillihuani in Peru, African education is created with goals in mind but is not limited to typical classroom settings; students continually participate in various learning activities as they grow in the community.\n\nThe culture within traditional African communities contain methods of learning. Through song and dance children learn more about their language as well as how to read and write. Oral traditions are used to teach children about history and morals as well as other forms of culture and practical skills for survival. In northern Tanzania and southern Kenya, the children of the Maasai pastoralists learn skills such as \"where to find water and green shrubs that can be fed to young calves\" in case of drought. Children are encouraged to show respect to their elders and through this, children learn how to show respect though their actions and words. A child can even learn the circumstances of their birth through their names. \"Onipede,\" a Yoruba name in Nigeria, suggests that the child was born soon after the death of a family member. Through their traditional science, children learn how to contribute to health and food production. everything that is a part of their life is used as a means to learn about themselves, their communities, and their culture.\n\nIf a person masters a skill by becoming deeply engaged in solving a problem, then giving students real world issues or opportunities to solve problems in their own lives and communities would significantly motivate and help them to master new concepts. Teaching students new scientific concepts by using cultural tools could eliminate the time spent trying to figure out whether concepts are useful or not. This may motivate learners and help them to master what we teach from the start. If we applied english and grammar lessons to effectively communicate with others in the community, students would be more inclined to effectively master these concepts since they would be using them for individual or group purposes. Finally, formal schooling, unlike an informal school setting, discourages students from learning and problem solving on their own.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15100", "title": "Interlingua", "text": "Interlingua\n\nInterlingua (; ISO 639 language codes \"ia\", \"ina\") is an Italic international auxiliary language (IAL), developed between 1937 and 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA). It ranks among the top most widely used IALs (along with Esperanto and Ido), and is the most widely used naturalistic IAL: in other words, its vocabulary, grammar and other characteristics are derived from natural languages, rather than being centrally planned. Interlingua was developed to combine a simple, mostly regular grammar with a vocabulary common to the widest possible range of western European languages, making it unusually easy to learn, at least for those whose native languages were sources of Interlingua's vocabulary and grammar. Conversely, it is used as a rapid introduction to many natural languages.\n\nInterlingua literature maintains that (written) Interlingua is comprehensible to the hundreds of millions of people who speak Romance languages, though it is actively spoken by only a few hundred.\n\nThe name Interlingua comes from the Latin words ', meaning \"between\", and ', meaning \"tongue\" or \"language\". These morphemes are identical in Interlingua. Thus, \"Interlingua\" would mean \"between language\".\n\nThe expansive movements of science, technology, trade, diplomacy, and the arts, combined with the historical dominance of the Greek and Latin languages have resulted in a large common vocabulary among European languages. With Interlingua, an objective procedure is used to extract and standardize the most widespread word or words for a concept found in a set of \"control languages\": English, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, with German and Russian as secondary references. Words from any language are eligible for inclusion, so long as their internationality is shown by their presence in these control languages. Hence, Interlingua includes such diverse word forms as Japanese \"geisha\" and \"samurai\", Arabic \"califa\", Guugu Yimithirr \"gangurru\" (Interlingua: kanguru), and Finnish \"sauna\".\n\nInterlingua combines this pre-existing vocabulary with a minimal grammar based on the control languages. People with a good knowledge of a Romance language, or a smattering of a Romance language plus a good knowledge of the \"international scientific vocabulary\" can frequently understand it immediately on reading or hearing it. The immediate comprehension of Interlingua, in turn, makes it unusually easy to learn. Speakers of other languages can also learn to speak and write Interlingua in a short time, thanks to its simple grammar and regular word formation using a small number of roots and affixes.\n\nOnce learned, Interlingua can be used to learn other related languages quickly and easily, and in some studies, even to understand them immediately. Research with Swedish students has shown that, after learning Interlingua, they can translate elementary texts from Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. In one 1974 study, an Interlingua class translated a Spanish text that students who had taken 150 hours of Spanish found too difficult to understand. Gopsill has suggested that Interlingua's freedom from irregularities allowed the students to grasp the mechanisms of language quickly.\n\nWords in Interlingua retain their original form from the source language; they are altered as little as possible to fit Interlingua's phonotactics. Each word retains its original spelling, pronunciation, and meanings. For this reason, Interlingua is frequently termed a \"naturalistic\" IAL.\n\nWhen compared to natural languages, Interlingua most resembles Spanish.\n\nThe American heiress Alice Vanderbilt Morris (1874–1950) became interested in linguistics and the international auxiliary language movement in the early 1920s, and in 1924, Morris and her husband, Dave Hennen Morris, established the non-profit International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in New York City. Their aim was to place the study of IALs on a scientific basis. Morris developed the research program of IALA in consultation with Edward Sapir, William Edward Collinson, and Otto Jespersen.\n\nThe IALA became a major supporter of mainstream American linguistics, funding, for example, numerous studies by Sapir, Collinson, and Morris Swadesh in the 1930s and 1940s. Alice Morris edited several of these studies and provided much of IALA's financial support. IALA also received support from such prestigious groups as the Carnegie Corporation, the Ford Foundation, the Research Corporation, and the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\nIn its early years, IALA concerned itself with three tasks: finding other organizations around the world with similar goals; building a library of books about languages and interlinguistics; and comparing extant IALs, including Esperanto, Esperanto II, Ido, Peano’s Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Novial, and Interlingue (Occidental). In pursuit of the last goal, it conducted parallel studies of these languages, with comparative studies of national languages, under the direction of scholars at American and European universities. It also arranged conferences with proponents of these IALs, who debated features and goals of their respective languages. With a \"concession rule\" that required participants to make a certain number of concessions, early debates at IALA sometimes grew from heated to explosive.\n\nAt the Second International Interlanguage Congress, held in Geneva in 1931, IALA began to break new ground; 27 recognized linguists signed a testimonial of support for IALA's research program. An additional eight added their signatures at the third congress, convened in Rome in 1933. That same year, Herbert N. Shenton and Edward L. Thorndike became influential in IALA's work by authoring key studies in the interlinguistic field.\n\nThe first steps towards the finalization of Interlingua were taken in 1937, when a committee of 24 eminent linguists from 19 universities published \"Some Criteria for an International Language and Commentary\". However, the outbreak of World War II in 1939 cut short the intended biannual meetings of the committee.\n\nOriginally, the association had not set out to create its own language. Its goal was to identify which auxiliary language already available was best suited for international communication, and how to promote it most effectively. However, after ten years of research, more and more members of IALA concluded that none of the existing interlanguages were up to the task. By 1937, the members had made the decision to create a new language, to the surprise of the world's interlanguage community.\n\nTo that point, much of the debate had been equivocal on the decision to use naturalistic (e.g., Peano’s Interlingua, Novial and Occidental) or systematic (e.g., Esperanto and Ido) words. During the war years, proponents of a naturalistic interlanguage won out. The first support was Thorndike's paper; the second was a concession by proponents of the systematic languages that thousands of words were already present in many, or even a majority, of the European languages. Their argument was that systematic derivation of words was a Procrustean bed, forcing the learner to unlearn and re-memorize a new derivation scheme when a usable vocabulary was already available. This finally convinced supporters of the systematic languages, and IALA from that point assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, IALA's research activities were moved from Liverpool to New York, where E. Clark Stillman established a new research staff. Stillman, with the assistance of Alexander Gode, developed a \"prototyping\" technique – an objective methodology for selecting and standardizing vocabulary based on a comparison of \"control languages\".\n\nIn 1943 Stillman left for war work and Gode became Acting Director of Research. IALA began to develop models of the proposed language, the first of which were presented in Morris's \"General Report\" in 1945.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1948, French linguist André Martinet was Director of Research. During this period IALA continued to develop models and conducted polling to determine the optimal form of the final language. In 1946, IALA sent an extensive survey to more than 3,000 language teachers and related professionals on three continents.\n\nFour models were canvassed:\n\nThe results of the survey were striking. The two more schematic models were rejected – K overwhelmingly. Of the two naturalistic models, M received somewhat more support than P. IALA decided on a compromise between P and M, with certain elements of C.\n\nMartinet took up a position at Columbia University in 1948, and Gode took on the last phase of Interlingua's development. The vocabulary and grammar of Interlingua were first presented in 1951, when IALA published the finalized \"\" and the 27,000-word \"Interlingua–English Dictionary\" (IED). In 1954, IALA published an introductory manual entitled \"Interlingua a Prime Vista\" (\"Interlingua at First Sight\").\n\nInterlingua as presented by the IALA is very close to Peano’s Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), both in its grammar and especially in its vocabulary. Accordingly, the very name \"Interlingua\" was kept, yet a distinct abbreviation was adopted: IA instead of IL.\n\nAn early practical application of Interlingua was the scientific newsletter \"Spectroscopia Molecular\", published from 1952 to 1980. In 1954, Interlingua was used at the Second World Cardiological Congress in Washington, D.C. for both written summaries and oral interpretation. Within a few years, it found similar use at nine further medical congresses. Between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, some thirty scientific and especially medical journals provided article summaries in Interlingua. Science Service, the publisher of \"Science Newsletter\" at the time, published a monthly column in Interlingua from the early 1950s until Gode's death in 1970. In 1967, the International Organization for Standardization, which normalizes terminology, voted almost unanimously to adopt Interlingua as the basis for its dictionaries.\n\nThe IALA closed its doors in 1953 but was not formally dissolved until 1956 or later. Its role in promoting Interlingua was largely taken on by Science Service, which hired Gode as head of its newly formed Interlingua Division. Hugh E. Blair, Gode's close friend and colleague, became his assistant. A successor organization, the Interlingua Institute, was founded in 1970 to promote Interlingua in the US and Canada. The new institute supported the work of other linguistic organizations, made considerable scholarly contributions and produced Interlingua summaries for scholarly and medical publications. One of its largest achievements was two immense volumes on phytopathology produced by the American Phytopathological Society in 1976 and 1977.\n\nInterlingua had attracted many former adherents of other international-language projects, notably Occidental and Ido. The former Occidentalist Ric Berger founded The Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI) in 1955, and by the late 1950s, interest in Interlingua in Europe had already begun to overtake that in North America.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, UMI has held international conferences every two years (typical attendance at the earlier meetings was 50 to 100) and launched a publishing programme that eventually produced over 100 volumes. Other Interlingua-language works were published by university presses in Sweden and Italy, and in the 1990s, Brazil and Switzerland. Several Scandinavian schools undertook projects that used Interlingua as a means of teaching the international scientific and intellectual vocabulary.\n\nIn 2000, the Interlingua Institute was dissolved amid funding disputes with the UMI; the American Interlingua Society, established the following year, succeeded the institute and responded to new interest emerging in Mexico.\n\nInterlingua was spoken and promoted in the Soviet bloc, despite attempts to suppress the language. In the German Democratic Republic, government officials confiscated the letters and magazines that the UMI sent to Walter Rädler, the Interlingua representative there.\n\nIn Czechoslovakia, Július Tomin published his first article on Interlingua in the Slovak magazine \"Príroda a spoločnosť\" (Nature and Society) in 1971, after which he received several anonymous threatening letters. He went on to become the Czech Interlingua representative, teach Interlingua in the school system, and publish a series of articles and books.\n\nToday, interest in Interlingua has expanded from the scientific community to the general public. Individuals, governments, and private companies use Interlingua for learning and instruction, travel, online publishing, and communication across language barriers. Interlingua is promoted internationally by the Union Mundial pro Interlingua. Periodicals and books are produced by many national organizations, such as the Societate American pro Interlingua, the Svenska Sällskapet för Interlingua, and the Union Brazilian pro Interlingua.\n\nIt is not certain how many people have an active knowledge of Interlingua. As noted above, Interlingua is claimed to be the most widely spoken naturalistic auxiliary language.\n\nInterlingua's greatest advantage is that it is the most widely \"understood\" international auxiliary language besides Interlingua (IL) de A.p.I. by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.\n\nInterlingua has active speakers on all continents, especially in South America and in Eastern and Northern Europe, most notably Scandinavia; also in Russia and Ukraine. There are copious Interlingua web pages, including editions of Wikipedia and Wiktionary, and a number of periodicals, including \"Panorama in Interlingua\" from the Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI) and magazines of the national societies allied with it. There are several active mailing lists, and Interlingua is also in use in certain Usenet newsgroups, particularly in the europa.* hierarchy. Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.\n\nInterlingua is taught in many high schools and universities, sometimes as a means of teaching other languages quickly, presenting interlinguistics, or introducing the international vocabulary. The University of Granada in Spain, for example, offers an Interlingua course in collaboration with the Centro de Formación Continua.\n\nEvery two years, the UMI organizes an international conference in a different country. In the year between, the Scandinavian Interlingua societies co-organize a conference in Sweden. National organizations such as the Union Brazilian pro Interlingua also organize regular conferences.\n\nInterlingua has a largely phonemic orthography.\n\nInterlingua uses the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet with no diacritics. The alphabet, pronunciation in IPA & letter name in Interlingua are:\n\n\nThe book \"Grammar of interlingua\" defines in §15 a \"collateral orthography\".\n\nUnassimilated foreign loanwords, or borrowed words, are spelled as in their language of origin. Their spelling may contain diacritics, or accent marks. If the diacritics do not affect pronunciation, they are removed.\n\nInterlingua is primarily a written language, and the pronunciation is not entirely settled. The sounds in parentheses are not used by all speakers.\n\nFor the most part, consonants are pronounced as in English, while the vowels are like Spanish. Written double consonants are pronounced as single. Interlingua has five falling diphthongs, , and , although and are rare.\n\nThe \"general rule\" is that stress falls on the vowel before the last consonant (e.g., \"lingua\", 'language', \"esser\", 'to be', \"requirimento\", 'requirement'), and where that is not possible, on the first vowel (\"via\", 'way', \"io crea\", 'I create'). There are a few exceptions, and the following rules account for most of them:\n\nSpeakers may pronounce all words according to the general rule mentioned above. For example, \"kilometro\" is acceptable, although \"kilometro\" is more common.\n\nInterlingua has no explicitly defined phonotactics. However, the prototyping procedure for determining Interlingua words, which strives for internationality, should in general lead naturally to words that are easy for most learners to pronounce. In the process of forming new words, an ending cannot always be added without a modification of some kind in between. A good example is the plural \"-s\", which is always preceded by a vowel to prevent the occurrence of a hard-to-pronounce consonant cluster at the end. If the singular does not end in a vowel, the final \"-s\" becomes \"-es.\"\n\nUnassimilated foreign loanwords, or borrowed words, are pronounced as in their language of origin.\n\nWords in Interlingua may be taken from any language, as long as their internationality is verified by their presence in seven \"control\" languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, and English, with German and Russian acting as secondary controls. These are the most widely spoken Romance, Germanic, and Slavic languages, respectively. Because of their close relationship, Spanish and Portuguese are treated as one unit. The largest number of Interlingua words are of Latin origin, with the Greek and Germanic languages providing the second and third largest number. The remainder of the vocabulary originates in Slavic and non-Indo-European languages.\n\nA word, that is a form with meaning, is eligible for the Interlingua vocabulary if it is verified by at least three of the four primary control languages. Either secondary control language can substitute for a primary language. Any word of Indo-European origin found in a control language can contribute to the eligibility of an international word. In some cases, the archaic or \"potential\" presence of a word can contribute to its eligibility.\n\nA word can be potentially present in a language when a derivative is present, but the word itself is not. English \"proximity\", for example, gives support to Interlingua \"proxime\", meaning 'near, close'. This counts as long as one or more control languages actually have this basic root word, which the Romance languages all do. Potentiality also occurs when a concept is represented as a compound or derivative in a control language, the morphemes that make it up are themselves international, and the combination adequately conveys the meaning of the larger word. An example is Italian \"fiammifero\" (lit. flamebearer), meaning \"match, lucifer\", which leads to Interlingua \"flammifero\", or \"match\". This word is thus said to be potentially present in the other languages although they may represent the meaning with a single morpheme.\n\nWords do not enter the Interlingua vocabulary solely because cognates exist in a sufficient number of languages. If their meanings have become different over time, they are considered different words for the purpose of Interlingua eligibility. If they still have one or more meanings in common, however, the word can enter Interlingua with this smaller set of meanings.\n\nIf this procedure did not produce an international word, the word for a concept was originally taken from Latin (see below). This only occurred with a few grammatical particles.\n\nThe form of an Interlingua word is considered an \"international prototype\" with respect to the other words. On the one hand, it should be neutral, free from characteristics peculiar to one language. On the other hand, it should maximally capture the characteristics common to all contributing languages. As a result, it can be transformed into any of the contributing variants using only these language-specific characteristics. If the word has any derivatives that occur in the source languages with appropriate parallel meanings, then their morphological connection must remain intact; for example, the Interlingua word for 'time' is spelled \"tempore\" and not \"*tempus\" or \"*tempo\" in order to match it with its derived adjectives, such as \"temporal\".\n\nThe language-specific characteristics are closely related to the sound laws of the individual languages; the resulting words are often close or even identical to the most recent form common to the contributing words. This sometimes corresponds with that of Vulgar Latin. At other times, it is much more recent or even contemporary. It is never older than the classical period.\n\nThe French \"œil\", Italian \"occhio\", Spanish \"ojo\", and Portuguese \"olho\" appear quite different, but they descend from a historical form \"oculus\". German \"Auge\", Dutch \"oog\" and English \"eye\" (cf. Czech and Polish \"oko\", Ukrainian \"око\" \"(óko)\") are related to this form in that all three descend from Proto-Indo-European \"*okʷ\". In addition, international derivatives like \"ocular\" and \"oculista\" occur in all of Interlingua's control languages. Each of these forms contributes to the eligibility of the Interlingua word. German and English base words do not influence the form of the Interlingua word, because their Indo-European connection is considered too remote. Instead, the remaining base words and especially the derivatives determine the form \"oculo\" found in Interlingua.\n\nNew words can be derived internally – that is, from existing Interlingua words – or extracted from the control languages in the manner of the original vocabulary. Internal word-building, though freer than in the control languages, is more limited than in schematic languages.\n\nOriginally, a word was taken from Latin if the usual procedure did not produce a sufficiently international word. More recently, modern alternatives have become generally accepted. For example, the southern Romance \"comprar\", meaning 'to buy', has replaced \"emer\", because the latter occurs only in derivatives in the control languages. Similarly, the modern form \"troppo\", 'too' or 'too much', has replaced \"nimis\", and \"ma\" 'but' has largely replaced \"sed\".\n\nInterlingua has been developed to omit any grammatical feature that is absent from any one primary control language. Thus, Interlingua has no noun–adjective agreement by gender, case, or number (cf. Spanish and Portuguese \"gatas negras\" or Italian \"gatte nere\", 'black female cats'), because this is absent from English, and it has no progressive verb tenses (English \"I am reading\"), because they are absent from French. Conversely, Interlingua distinguishes singular nouns from plural nouns because all the control languages do. With respect to the secondary control languages, Interlingua has articles, unlike Russian.\n\nThe definite article \"le\" is invariable, as in English. Nouns have no grammatical gender. Plurals are formed by adding \"-s\", or \"-es\" after a final consonant. Personal pronouns take one form for the subject and one for the direct object and reflexive. In the third person, the reflexive is always \"se\". Most adverbs are derived regularly from adjectives by adding \"-mente\", or \"-amente\" after a \"-c\". An adverb can be formed from any adjective in this way.\n\nVerbs take the same form for all persons (\"io vive, tu vive, illa vive\", 'I live', 'you live', 'she lives'). The indicative (\"pare\", 'appear', 'appears') is the same as the imperative (\"pare!\" 'appear!'), and there is no subjunctive. Three common verbs usually take short forms in the present tense: \"es\" for 'is', 'am', 'are;' \"ha\" for 'has', 'have;' and \"va\" for 'go', 'goes'. A few irregular verb forms are available, but rarely used.\n\nThere are four simple tenses (present, past, future, and conditional), three compound tenses (past, future, and conditional), and the passive voice. The compound structures employ an auxiliary plus the infinitive or the past participle (e.g., \"Ille ha arrivate\", 'He has arrived'). Simple and compound tenses can be combined in various ways to express more complex tenses (e.g., \"Nos haberea morite\", 'We would have died').\n\nWord order is subject–verb–object, except that a direct object pronoun or reflexive pronoun comes before the verb (\"Io les vide\", 'I see them'). Adjectives may precede or follow the nouns they modify, but they most often follow it. The position of adverbs is flexible, though constrained by common sense.\n\nThe grammar of Interlingua has been described as similar to that of the Romance languages, but greatly simplified, primarily under the influence of English. More recently, Interlingua's grammar has been likened to the simple grammars of Japanese and particularly Chinese.\n\nSome opponents argue that, being based on a few European languages, Interlingua is best suited for speakers of European languages. Others contend that Interlingua has spelling irregularities that, while internationally recognizable in written form, increase the time needed to fully learn the language, especially for those unfamiliar with Indo-European languages. A related point of criticism is that Interlingua's credential as being Standard Average European is too weak outside the Romance languages. Some opponents see the Germanic, Slavic, and Celtic languages, in particular, as having little influence.\n\nProponents argue that Interlingua's source languages include not only Romance languages but English, German, and Russian as well. Moreover, the source languages are widely spoken internationally, and large numbers of their words also appear in other languages – still more when derivative forms and loan translations are included. Tests had shown that if a larger number of source languages were used, the results would be about the same. So, IALA selected a much simpler extraction procedure for Interlingua with little adverse effect on its internationality.\n\nFrom an essay by Alexander Gode:\n\nAs with Esperanto, there have been proposals for a flag of Interlingua; the proposal by Czech translator Karel Podrazil is recognized by multilingual sites. It consists of a white four-pointed star extending to the edges of the flag and dividing it into an upper blue and lower red half. The star is symbolic of the four cardinal directions, and the two halves symbolize Romance and non-Romance speakers of Interlingua who understand each other.\n\nAnother symbol of Interlingua is a globe surrounded by twelve stars on a black or blue background, echoing the twelve stars of the Flag of Europe (because the source languages of Interlingua are purely European). Novial [ Wikipedia] marks Interlingua with the Flag of Europe itself.\n\n\n\n"}

It is widely used in the Middle East, North Africa, the Mediterranean, South Asia, and the Horn of Africa as eyeliner to contour and/or darken the eyelids and as mascara for the eyelashes. It is worn mostly by women, but also by some men and children.\n\nKohl has also been used in India as a cosmetic for a long time. In addition, mothers would apply kohl to their infants' eyes soon after birth. Some did this to \"strengthen the child's eyes\", and others believed it could prevent the child from being cursed by the evil eye.\n\nThe Arabic name and the Biblical Hebrew \n\nThe English word \"alcohol\" is a loan of the Arabic word (via Middle Latin and French; originally in the sense \"powder of antimony\"; the modern meaning is from the 18th century).\n\nThe Persian word for kohl is سرمه \"sormeh\", from Turkish \"sürme\" \"drawing along\", which has led to Hindi and Urdu \"surma\" (सुरमा, سرمہ) as well as Russian сурьма. In some South Asian languages, the term \"kājal\" is used. This last term may originally have a Dravidian root.\n\nIn Hausa, it is also known as \"tozali\" and \"kwalli\".\n\nThe Greek and Latin terms for antimony, \"stibium\", στίβι, στίμμι, were borrowed from the Egyptian name .\n\nKohl has been worn traditionally since the Protodynastic Period of Egypt (ca. 3100 BCE) by Egyptian queens and noble women, who used stibnite (the sulfide of antimony rather than of lead). The cosmetic palettes used for its preparation assumed a prominent role in the late Predynastic Egyptian culture.\n\nKohl was originally used as protection against eye ailments. There was also a belief that darkening around the eyes would protect one from the harsh rays of the sun.\n\nGalena eye paint (later termed \"Kohl\" in Arabic from the Akkadian word for the cosmetic) was widely applied in Ancient Egypt. Upper eyelids were painted black and lower ones were colored green, as depicted in ancient texts that describe the use of both black galena and green malachite. Ancient graves from the pre-historic Tasian culture point to the early application of galena in Egypt, a custom stretching from the Badarian period through to the Coptic era. Although found locally, both black galena and green malachite were also imported from nearby regions in Western Asia, Coptos and the Land of Punt.\n\nThe 18th Dynasty Ancient Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut would also grind charred frankincense into kohl eyeliner. This is the first recorded use of the resin. The frankincense itself had originally been obtained during an expedition to the ancient Land of Punt in this New Kingdom dynasty ( 1500 BC).\n\nAdditionally, the pioneering Muslim scholar Ibn Abi Shayba described in a legal compilation how to apply kohl to the eye, as narrated by earlier authorities.\n\nBerber and Arab women in North Africa and the Middle East, respectively, also apply kohl to their faces. A vertical line is drawn from the bottom lip to the chin and along the bridge of the nose. Originally the line from the bottom lip to the chin shows whether a woman is married or not. This form of using Kohl on the face originates from the Arabian Peninsula, and was introduced in the 7th century in North-Africa.\n\nUsage of kohl eye paint in the Horn of Africa dates to the ancient Kingdom of Punt. Somali, Djiboutian, Ethiopian and Eritrean women have long applied kohl (\"kuul\") for cosmetic purposes, as well as to cleanse the eyes, lengthen eyelashes, and to protect the eyes from the sun's rays.\n\nKohl is also applied in parts of West Africa by the Fulani and the affiliated Hausa people. In addition, it is used by the Tuareg, Wolof, Mandinka, Soninke, Dagomba, Kanuri, and other predominantly Muslim inhabitants of the Sahel and Sahara regions. Kohl is used by both sexes, and by people of all ages, mainly during weddings, Islamic festivals (such as Eid ul Fitr and Eid ul Adha), and trips to the mosque for the weekly Jumuah congregational prayer.\n\nFor women, kohl or black-henna is applied to the face as well in a similar manner as that practiced by communities in North Africa.\n\nKohl is known by various names in South Asian languages, like \"surma\" in Punjabi, Sylheti and Urdu, \"kajal\" in Hindi, Bengali and Gujarati, \"kajal\" in Sanskrit, \"kajalh\" in Marathi, \"kanmashi\" in Malayalam, \"kaadige\" in Kannada, \"kaatuka\" in Telugu and \"kan mai\" in Tamil. In India, it is used by women as a type of eyeliner that is put around the edge of the eyes. In many parts of India, especially in Southern India, Karnataka in particular, women of the household prepare the kajal. This homemade kajal is used even for infants. Local tradition considers it to be a very good coolant for the eyes and believes that it protects the eyesight and vision from the sun.\n\nSome Indian Ayurvedic or Ancient Indian Herbal medicines manufacturing companies add camphor and other medicinal herbs that are beneficial for eyes in their kajal. It can serve not only as a cosmetic but also as medicine for the eyes.\n\nIn Punjabi culture, surma is a traditional ceremonial dye, which predominantly men of the Punjab wear around their eyes on special social or religious occasions. It is usually applied by the wife or the mother of the person.\n\nSome women also add a dot of kajal on the left side of the foreheads or on the waterline of the eye of women and children to ward off \"buri nazar\". \"Buri nazar\" literally means 'bad glance' and is comparable to the 'evil eye', although it can be interpreted as ill-wishes of people or even lustful eyes, in the sense of men ogling women. It signifies that the person is not perfect, with them having 'black mark', and hence, people wouldn't be jealous of their beauty.\nIn the centuries-old Indian Bharatnatayam dances, the dancers apply heavy kohl to their eyes so as to draw attention to their eye gestures and movement. The kohl is then applied to eyebrows and eyelids to add further enhancement to the dancers.\n\nAccording to Islamic belief, the use of a particular type of kohl is thought to be healing and used for medicinal purposes for both men and women. This is based on the following saying by the Prophet Muhammed: \"One of the best kinds of kohl that you use is Ithmid (antimony); it brightens the vision and makes the hair (eye-lashes) grow.\"\n\nIt is also a tradition in some Muslim countries for men to apply kohl to their eyes during Ramadan. However this practice is not necessarily based on any authentic sources. \nModern day Salafi Muslims use kohl as they believe it was the practice of the Prophet Muhammed. \nPreparation of homemade kajal begins with dipping a clean, white, thin muslin cloth, about four by four inches square, in sandalwood paste or the juice of Alstonia scholaris (Manjal karisilanganni), which is then dried in the shade. This dip and dry process is done all day long. After sunset, a wick is made out of the cloth, which is then used to light a mud lamp filled with castor oil. A brass vessel is kept over the lamp, leaving a little gap, just enough for the oxygen to aid the burning of the lamp. This is left burning overnight. In the morning, one or two drops of pure ghee (clarified cow's butter) or castor oil are added to the soot which now lines the brass vessel. It is then stored in a clean dry box.\n\nAll the ingredients used in this preparation (sandalwood/Manjal karsilanganni, castor oil, ghee) are believed to have medicinal properties. They are still used in Indian therapies like ayurveda and Siddha medicines.\n\nIn rural Bengal, kajal is made from the \"Monosha\" plant, a type of succulent spurge (\"Euphorbia neriifolia\"). The leaf of Monosha is covered with oil and is kept above a burning diya (mud lamp). Within minutes the leaf is covered with creamy soft black soot which is so safe and sterile that it is even applied to infants.\n\nThe content of kohl and the recipes to prepare it vary greatly. In North Africa and Middle East, homemade kohl is often made by grinding galena (lead sulfide). In the west, manufacturers use amorphous carbon or organic charcoal instead of lead. Plant oils and the soot from various nuts, seeds, and gum resins are often added to the carbon powder. Unfortunately, the non-lead products are considered to be of inferior quality to the older, traditional varieties and therefore there has been an increase in the use of handmade, lead-based kohl.\n\nFor decades various conflicting reports in the literature have been published relating to kohl application to eyes being responsible for causing higher blood lead concentration, which may cause lead poisoning. While at the same time, a number of research studies and reports have also been published refuting any such links with increased blood lead level upon kohl (surma) application.\n\nA group of researchers in China tried to find some scientific basis of this claimed property of lead sulphide \n(galena) relating to absorption of sun rays when applied into the eyes in the form of kohl. The authors reported the ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectra of a thin film of lead sulphide prepared on \"Indium Tin Oxide\" (ITO) substrate. The spectra showed that lead sulphide thin films had higher absorption and lower transmittance in UV light band which further increases with the increased deposition voltage.\n\nThe drive to eliminate lead from kohl was sparked by studies in the early 1990s of preparations of kohl that found high levels of contaminants, including lead. Lead levels in commercial kohl preparations were as high as 84%. Kohl samples from Oman and Cairo, analyzed using X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, found galena. One decade later, a study of kohl manufactured in Egypt and India found that a third of the samples studied contained lead, while the remaining two-thirds contained amorphous carbon, zincite, cuprite, goethite, elemental silicon or talc, hematite, minium, and organic compounds.\n\nLead-contaminated kohl use has been linked to increased levels of lead in the bloodstream, putting its users at risk of lead poisoning and lead intoxication. Complications of lead poisoning include anemia, growth retardation, low IQ, convulsions, and in severe cases, death. Anemia from lead poisoning is of special concern in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries where other forms of anemia are prevalent, including iron deficiency anemia (from malnutrition) and hemoglobinopathy (sickle cell anemia, thalassemia).\n\nThese banned products are different from lead-free cosmetics that use the term \"kohl\" only to describe its shade/color, rather than its actual ingredients. Some modern eye cosmetics are marketed as \"kohl\", but are prepared differently and in accordance with relevant health standards.\n\nEye cosmetics such as surma are recognized as one of the important sources of lead exposure in Pakistan. As adverse health effects of heavy metals are a public health concern, where especially lead may cause negative health impacts to human fetal and infantile development, a study in Pakistan of pregnant women' nails in 2016, showed thirteen nail samples out of 84 nails analyzed, contained lead higher than the concentration (13.6 μg/g) of the fatal lead poisoning case, with the possibility of an external contamination. The observations showed that lead-containing surma consists of fine particle of galena (ore of lead sulfide) in respirable dust range (less than 10 μm) and relative in vitro bioavailability of lead in the surma was determined as 5.2%. Thus, lead-containing surma consists of inhalable and bioavailable particles, and it contributes an increased risk of lead exposure.\n\n\"Blue\" Kohl is a dark-bluish black pigment composed of both lead-based compounds as well as a compound of antimony. The lead-based compounds in kohl are galena (PbS) – dark grey and gloss laurionite ( PbCl(OH)) – white phosgenite ((PbCl)CO); cerussite (PbCO) – blue. The antimony-based compound in kohl is stibnite (SbS) – blue.\n\nIn January 2010, French researchers reported that the particular heavy eye makeup that ancient Egyptians wore may have had medical benefits. At submicromolar concentrations, the specially made lead compounds can elicit overproduction of nitrous oxide (NO), which in turn can trigger an enhancement of the immune response.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians, documented in the Ebers Papyrus ( 1550 BCE), discuss these compounds within kohl as protective for the eyes. Indeed, kohl was used an eyeliner and cosmetic. There are a number of endemic ocular diseases in the Nile region including trachoma, a chlamydial organism which can cause corneal scarring and conjunctival cicatricial disease, with visual loss. Kohl was used not only as a cosmetic but also as a medicinal collyrium (from Gr. kollurion). Two of kohl's lead compounds — the lead chlorides laurionite and phosgenite — were not natural to the Nile valley. It is believed they were intentionally synthesized by the ancient Egyptians for this purpose. The widespread use of kohl across the Mediterranean and the Mid-east attests to its ability to protect the eye from infectious disease and be used as a cosmetic.\n\nKohl is not on the list of color additives approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which considers kohl unsafe for use due to its potential lead content. It is thus illegal to import into, or sell in, the United States.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "369993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369993", "title": "Line (heraldry)", "text": "Line (heraldry)\n\nThe lines of partition used to divide and vary fields and charges in heraldry are by default straight, but may have many different shapes. Care must sometimes be taken to distinguish these types of lines from the extremely unusual and non-traditional use of lines as charges, and to distinguish these shapes from actual charges, such as \"a mount [or triple mount] in base,\" or, particularly in German heraldry, different kinds of embattled from castle walls.\n\nIn Scotland, varied lines of partition are often used to modify a bordure (or sometimes another ordinary) to difference the arms of a cadet from the chief of the house.\n\nAn ordinary \"indented\" is bounded by small zigzags like a triangle wave, with peaks on one side matching peaks on the other. An ordinary \"dancetty\" is similar, but with peaks matching troughs, so that the width is constant; it also typically has fewer points than \"indented\". In early armory these were not distinguished. In the arms of the 55th Electronic Combat Group of the United States Air Force the indented is \"edged wider on the back angle (sinister) than on the face (dexter) of each angle\".\n\n\"Dentilly\" is a modern invention, similar to \"indented\", but with one of the sides of the points perpendicular and the other angled, as in a sawtooth wave.\n\n\"Rayonné\" (also \"rayonne\", \"rayonny\"; from French \"rayonner\") may be considered a variant of indented, but with wavy instead of straight lines, as in the conventional representation of rays of the sun. \"Rayonne palewise\" appears in the arms of the 172d Support Battalion of the United States Army. A chief enarched rayonné on a gold field appears in the arms of Sechelt, British Columbia, forming the appearance of a sun.\n\nThe arms of the Worshipful Company of Security Professionals contain an example of \"indented acute,\" a form of indented with higher peaks.\n\nThe number of peaks in indented is almost never specified, but an exception is the arms of Arthur D. Stairs: \"Per bend sinister indented of six steps Gules and Sable\", and Westville, Natal, South Africa bears \"Sable, issuant from behind a fence of spears in base Argent, a fig tree in leaf Or; on a chief indented of four points to base, also Or, three lion's faces Sable\".\n\nIn South Africa there are a number of examples of \"dancetty inverted\". While the number of peaks in dancetty are three unless otherwise specified, the arms of Wagland show \"dancetty of two points\" and the arms of Baz Manning show a chief \"dancetty of two full points upwards\". The arms of the Matroosberg Transitional Representative Council in South Africa give an example of \"dancetty… in the shape of a letter W\". The arms of the French department of Côtes d'Armor show \"émanché,\" which would be equivalent to the English \"per fess dancetty of two full points upwards.\" The arms of Baron Griffiths of Fforestfach are \"Paly of four Vert and Argent per fess enhanced indented of two points upwards each point double barbed throughout issuing in base a pile double barbed throughout all counterchanged\". The arms of Alaric John Martin Woodrow show an example of \"barry dancetty each point double barbed\", used to represent a line of fir trees as a play on the surname. The arms of the Free State in South Africa show \"a chief dancetty, the peaks terminating in merlons,\" and so might be called a combination of dancetty and embattled; a similar hybrid can be seen in the arms of the Agricultural Gymnasium. Hoerskool Hangklip provide an example of \"dancetty with points flattened\", and Blouberg of \"dancetty the peaks couped.\" It is difficult to know whether to characterise the \"wall-like extremity with five merlons and four embrasures\" in the arms of the Kurgan Oblast in Russia as a divided field or a charge.\n\nThe arms of Ernest John Altobello show a chevronel with the upper edge \"grady\" (this is identical in appearance to indented) \"and ensigned of a tower Argent\".\n\nA line \"wavy\" (also called \"undy\") is a sine wave, often used to represent water; a line \"nebuly\" is similar but with more exaggerated meanders, representing clouds. There are confusing, ambiguous and non-standard uses of \"a wavy\" in the military heraldry of the United States to refer to irregularly wavy lines.\n\nThe wavy chief in the arms of Lord Nelson was blazoned as \"undulated\".\n\nThe field of the arms of the 40th Finance Battalion of the United States Army is blazoned \"per fess wavy (in the manner of a Taeguk)\" The chief in the arms of Professor S.W. Haines is \"wavy of one crest and depressed in the centre of one point\".\n\nIn \"wavy crested\" the waves appear like pointed breakers.\n\nThe arms of James Hill show an example of barrulets \"wavy crested to the sinister on the upper edge\". There are examples of even greater complexity and specificity in the \"wavy\" line, such as the arms of \"Baron Nolan ... [which include] three 'bars wavy couped composed of two troughs and a wave invected of one point on the upper edge and engrailed of one point on the lower edge'\".\n\nSpecification of the number of \"undulations\" in nebuly can be seen by Jochen Wilke's roundel, with ten. (It is uncommon for lines of partition to modify a charge other than an ordinary.)\n\nThese lines consist of a series of circular arcs curving in the same direction, meeting at angles, forming points outward (\"engrailed\") or inward (\"invected\"). When these terms are applied to a partition rather than to an ordinary, the first part of the field is the \"interior\".\n\nThe arms of Liverpool Hope University include \"a Cross engrailed of one point on each limb\". The Flag of Flintshire is \"Argent a cross engrailed sable between four Cornish choughs proper\".\nThe arms of the Pretoria Philatelic Society show a \"chief engrailed and couped\", having the appearance of the edge of a perforated postage stamp. The arms of Kutlwanong Dorp in South Africa provide an example both of the specification of the number of lobes in invected, and those lobes being \"trefly.\"\n\nA line \"embattled\" is a square wave, representing the battlements of a castle.\n\nWhen a fess is embattled, only the topmost edge is altered (as in the arms of Muri bei Bern). If both edges are to be embattled, the term \"embattled-counter-embattled\" (or \"counter-embattled,\" as in the arms of Sir Cecil Denniston Burney) is used. In this case the lines are parallel. If gaps face gaps, the term \"bretessé\" is used. There is at least one emblazonment suggesting that the orle is only embattled on its outer edge.\n\nItalian armory has a variant, Ghibelline battlement, with notched merlons.\nIn a line \"raguly\" the extensions are oblique rather than orthogonal, like the stumps of limbs protruding from a tree-trunk.\n\n\"Dovetailed\" is as in carpentry. Unlike embattled, gaps face gaps.\n\n\"Potenty\" may be considered a variant in which the points are extended to \"T\"-shapes (\"potent\" means a crutch).\n\nA line \"embattled grady\" or \"battled embattled\" consists of series of two or three steps, as if each merlon has a smaller merlon atop it. Parker's glossary says that \"double-embattled\" may be the same as this.\n\nThe arms of Schellenberg, in Liechtenstein, provide an example of embattled \"with three battlements.\" The bordure in the arms of Boissy l'Aillerie, in Val d'Oise, France, has nine battlements (and the bordure is also masoned and contains doorlike openings).\n\nA very unusual occurrence of embattled occurs in the arms of the 136th Military Police Battalion of the United States Army: \"Sable, a fesse enhanced and embattled Or, overall a magnifying glass palewise rim Argent (Silver Gray), the glass surmounting and enlarging the middle crenel between two merlons, the handle Gules edged of the second bearing a mullet Argent.\"\n\nThe arms of Baron Kirkwood show two chevronels \"round embattled\" (the merlons are rounded rather than squares). There are also examples of \"embattled pointed\" and \"embattled in the form of mine dumps\".\n\nJames Parker cites the arms of Christopher Draisfield: \"Gules, a chevron raguly of two bastons couped at the top argent.\"\n\nThe arms of Zodwa Special School for Severely Mentally Handicapped Children show a chevron dovetailed, the peak ensigned with a potent issuant\".\n\nSome examples also exist of \"urdy,\" where the line is in the shapes of the upside-down and rightside-up \"shields\" of vair (this is to be distinguished from \"couped urdy\", in which the couping takes a pointed form ). The arms of Winfried Paul Reinhold Steinhagen are \"Per chevron, the peak in the form of a merlon round urdy of four, Gules and Or, in chief a horse forcene and a goat clymant respecting one another, Argent, and in base a bull's head Sable armed Argent; a chief per fess in the form of a wall with three watchtowers, Azure and Argent, the latter charged with a strand of barbed wire throughout, Sable\". The \"unusual, if not unique\" arms of Lourens Du Toit are \"Per fess of three pallets urdy Sable and Or\".\n\nThe arms of the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons have a bordure emblazoned \"dentate,\" although this appears to be quite similar to dovetailed.\n\nA line \"embowed\" consists of a single arch.\n\nA line \"nowy\" contains a semicircular protuberance in the middle. A line with an angular protuberance in the middle, like a battlement, is called \"escartelly\".\n\nThe arms of Laerskool Bosveld in South Africa have a field \"Per chevron embowed trefly, Azure and Argent\".\n\nThe arms of Léopold-Henri Amyot show \"per fess ogivy\"; this is based on the ogive or pointed arch.\n\nChiefs, fesses and palar dividing lines are sometimes seen \"arched\" and \"double-arched\" (and there is an example of triple-arched), though there is some debate as to whether or not these are lines of partition. That arched can be combined with partition lines can be seen from the arms of South Lanarkshire in Scotland. Arched can also be \"reversed\".\n\nThe rare line \"bevilled\" modifies the bendlets in the arms of Thomas Roy Barnes and the pairle in the arms of Rovaniemi, Finland. This lightning-bolt type of line with one zigzag is to be distinguished from \"angled\", in which the line takes a 90-degree upwards turn before another 90-degree turn, continuing parallel and in the same direction from the old line. There is a South African example of \"bevilled to sinister\", and a bend \"double bevilled\" can be seen in the arms of Philip Kushlick School.\n\nA line \"trefly\" shows protuberances in the form of trefoils.\n\nThe arms of St. Paul's Cathedral in Regina, Saskatchewan contain a bordure \"its inner line looping in foils of poplar of the field within the bordure at each angle and at regular intervals between\".\n\nThe arms of Carmichael show a fess \"wreathy,\" which may or may not be strictly speaking a line of partition, but it does modify the fess; the coat is not blazoned as a \"wreath in fess\". James Parker calls this \"tortilly.\"\n\nThe 20th century saw some innovations in lines of partition. \"Erablé\", a series of alternating upside-down and rightside-up maple-leaves, is a typically Canadian line of partition, though the College of Arms in London has used it in a few grants (but compare the cross \"nowy erablé\" in the arms of Katherina Fahlman Selinger Schaaf. A Finnish line of partition, invented by Kaj Cajander and called \"kuusikoro,\" which is called \"fir-tree topped\" in Britain, and which the Canadian Heraldic Authority coined the term \"sapiné\" to blazon, resembles fir trees; in the arms of Guy Selvester this is called \"sapinage\". A line resembling fir twigs, and so called in British blazon, is called \"sapinagy\" in Canada (though sadly there is no example of it in the online Canadian Public Register), and \"havukoro\" in Finland.) Other 20th-century examples of lines, or things akin to lines, include the 1990 grant to Albersdorf-Prebuch, also in Austria, in which the upper line of the fess takes the form of fruit, the bottom of vine-leaves. (It is debatable what the distinction is between such lines, and examples such as the arms of Bierbaum am Auersbach, a town in Styria, in which three pears grow from a pall.)\n\nThe South African Bureau of Heraldry has developed the line of partition \"serpentine\"(which has also been called 'ondoyant'), which is rather like wavy, but with only one \"wave\", one complete cycle of a sine wave; the serpentine in the arms of the Mtubatuba Primary School is defined as \"dexter to chief and sinister to base\". (Similar is the German \"im Schlangenschnitt\" (snake-wise).) It has also developed the uniquely South-African lines of division (which can also form the ends of a charge) \"nowy of a Cape Town gable\" (now called just \"nowy gabled\"), and \"nowy of an Indian cupola.\" Similarly, the fess line in the arms of the Council for Social and Associated Workers is \"nowy of a trimount inverted\", the fess in the arms of Mossel Bay is \"nowy of two Karoo gable houses\", the chief in the arms of the Lenasia South-East Management Committee is \"nowy of an Indian cupola\", the chief in the arms of the Genealogical Society of South Africa is \"double nowy gably\" and that of Frederick Brownell is \"gably of three\". The arms of the Reyneke Bond (i.e. Reyneke Family Association) are \"Per fess, in each flank double nowy fitchy to base, Azure and Or, a lion rampant per fess of the second and Gules, a chief Or\". The plain chief identifies these as the arms of a family association. The arms of Itsokolele, South Africa include \"a chief double fitchy inverted\".\n\n\"Broad fitchy couped\" is a line of South-African origin similar in appearance to a mine-dump or escartelly with sloping sides.\n\nChevrons can be topped with a fleur-de-lys, and ordinaries with non-straight edges (particularly if they are dancetty or engrailed) can have the points topped with demi fleurs-de-lys. It has sometimes been said that in some reference works flory-counter-flory (and flory) is treated like a line of partition, even though strictly speaking it is not – though it has been used for centuries that way in the royal arms of Scotland blazoning the double tressure (Public Register of Arms, Lyon Court, Edinburgh) and used by the College of arms in blazoning coats like that of Sutherland of Dunstanburgh Castle (Gules, a chevron flory-counterflory between in chief three mullets and in base a lymphad all or) and is used by the South African Bureau of Heraldry blazoning the coat of Huis Tankotie of the University of Pretoria (Per fess, flory counter-flory, Argent and Azure, in base within the flower an annulet Sable; a bordure counterchanged)and Emmanuel-Opleidingsentrum in the South African Bureau of Heraldry's online database. (Flory is sometimes varied with other shapes than the fleur-de-lys, when it is blazoned as \"flory of\".)\n\nA vague and unhelpful blazon of the 27th Air Division of the United States Air Force provides for a \"bordure of distinctive outline\".\n\nEach shield is \"Per fess _______ argent and gules\", but some of these lines have no common English name.\n\n\n"}

There are two kinds of reconstruction:\n\n\nTexts discussing linguistic reconstruction commonly preface reconstructed forms with an asterisk (*) to distinguish them from attested forms.\n\nAn attested word from which a root in the proto-language is reconstructed is a reflex. More generally, a reflex is the known derivative of an earlier form, which may be either attested or reconstructed. Reflexes of the same source are cognates.\n\nFirst, languages that are thought to have arisen from a common proto-language must meet certain criteria in order to be grouped together; this is a process called subgrouping. Since this grouping is based purely on linguistics, manuscripts and other historical documentation should be analyzed to accomplish this step. However, the assumption that the delineations of linguistics always align with those of culture and ethnicity must not be made. One of the criteria that the grouped languages usually exemplify shared innovation. This means that the languages must show common changes made throughout history. In addition, most grouped languages have shared retention. This is similar to the first criterion, but instead of changes, they are features that have stayed the same in both languages.\n\nBecause linguistics, as in other scientific areas, seeks to reflect simplicity, an important principle in the linguistic reconstruction process is to generate the least possible number of phonemes that correspond to available data. This principle is again reflected when choosing the sound quality of phonemes, as the one which results in the fewest changes (with respect to the data) is preferred.\n\n"}

There have been proposals to designate a state horse in Oregon as well as in Arizona (where an ongoing campaign sought to designate the Colonial Spanish Horse as the state horse prior to the state centennial in 2012), but neither proposal is yet successful. In one state, North Dakota, the state horse is officially designated the \"honorary state equine.\" Two additional states have not designated a specific state horse, but have designed a horse or horse breed as its official state animals: the horse in New Jersey and the Morgan horse breed in Vermont.\n\nSome breeds, such as the American Quarter Horse in Texas and the Morgan horse in Vermont and Massachusetts, were named as the state horse because of the close connection between the history of the breed and the state. Others, including the Tennessee Walking Horse and the Missouri Fox Trotter, include the state in the official breed name. School children have been persuasive lobbyists for the cause of some state horses, such as the Colonial Spanish Horse being named the state horse of North Carolina due to the presence of the Spanish-descended Banker horses in the Outer Banks, while others have been brought to official status through the lobbying efforts of their breed registries.\n\nOfficial state horses are one of many state symbols officially designated by states.

There are no reliable census data for the Macuna. The entire population was estimated at some 600 individuals in 1991 (compared with 400 in 1973), of which 450 lived in Colombia. \n\nExcept of spoken accounts of a violent past with the southern neighbors, especially the Yauna and Tanimuka Indians, little is known about the early history of the Macuna. Their first mention are in the Portuguese accounts of the 18th century; as the commercial exploitation of rubber began in the Colombian Amazon in the late 19th century, contact with outsiders occurred more frequently, and with a negative effect. Men were taken away with force to work for the rubber patrons, a situation that lasted into the 1940s. The first Catholic mission was established in the area in the 1960s, though intermittent contact with missionaries has existed at least since the 18th century. \n\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s brought a new boom into the region, with the growing of coca leaves for illegal trade, which brought substantial quantities of trade goods and money for the indigenous people who working for the White patrons established in the area. By the mid-1980s the production of coca leaves ended as abruptly as it began, but shortly after gold has been discovered along the Taraira River, just a few days away from the Macuna territory. Thousands of White gold miners entered the territory, a majority through Macuna lands, a situation which the Macuna used as a new source of trade goods and money. Additionally, many young men of the group go to the gold fields for a few weeks or months to look for gold on their own or under the temporary employment of a White patron.\n\nDespite this, the Macuna essentially subsist on swidden-cultivation, hunting, fishing, and gathering of forest products. The staple is manioc, but plantains, sweet potatoes, bananas and sugarcane are also cultivated. Meat comes from game such as pacas, tapir, peccaries, large birds, monkeys and caimans. The fur trade, especially the skins of jaguars, ocelots, and otters played an important role in the Macuna economy, until it was prohibited in the 1970s. \n\nIn the 1990s the Colombian government created two Indian reservation encompassing most of the Macuna land, which provided them with enhanced control over their territory.\n"}

He prefers geometric shapes and motifs, often ignoring the female form. He advanced into unisex fashions, sometimes experimental, and not always practical. He founded his fashion house in 1950 and introduced the \"bubble dress\" in 1954.\n\nHe was designated UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador in 1991.\n\nOn 16 October 2009, Cardin was nominated Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.\n\nCardin was born in San Biagio di Callalta near Treviso. Cardin’s parents were wealthy landowners, but to escape fascism they left Italy and settled in France in 1924. His father, a wealthy French wine merchant, wished him to study architecture, but from childhood he was interested in dressmaking.\n\nCardin was educated in central France. Beginning his career early, at age 14 he worked as a clothier’s apprentice, learning the basics of fashion design and construction. In 1939, he left home to work for a tailor in Vichy, where he began making suits for women. During World War II, he worked in the Red Cross, launching humanitarian interests that continue to this day.\n\nCardin moved to Paris in 1945. There, he studied architecture and worked with the fashion house of Paquin after World War II. He worked with Elsa Schiaparelli until he became head of Christian Dior's tailleure atelier in 1947, but was denied work at Balenciaga.\n\nCardin founded his own house in 1950. His career was launched when he designed about 30 of the costumes for \"the party of the century\", a masquerade ball at Palazzo Labia in Venice on 3 September 1951, hosted by the palazzo's owner, Carlos de Beistegui. He began with haute couture in 1953.\n\nCardin was the first couturier to turn to Japan as a high fashion market when he travelled there in 1959.\n\nIn 1959, he was expelled from the Chambre Syndicale for launching a ready-to-wear collection for the Printemps department store as the first couturier in Paris, but was soon reinstated.\nDuring the 1960s, Cardin began a practice that is now commonplace by creating the system of licences that he was to apply to fashion. A clothing collection launched around this period surprised all by displaying the designer’s logo on the garments for the first time.\n\nAs haute couture began to decline, ready-to-wear soared as well as Cardin's designs. He was the first to combine the \"mini\" and the \"maxi\" skirts of the 1970s. He introduced a new hemline that had long pom-pom panels or fringe that swayed as the body moved.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, Cardin set another new trend: \"mod chic\". This trend holds true for form or for a combination of forms, which did not exist at the time. He was the first to combine extremely short and ankle length pieces. He made dresses with slits and batwing sleeves with dimensions, and mixed circular movement and gypsy skirts with structured tops. These creations allowed for the geometric shapes that captivated him to be contrasted, with both circular and straight lines. Cardin was an icon for starting this popular fashion movement of the early seventies.\n\nCardin was fascinated with adventure. Enthralled with the idea of putting a man on the moon, Cardin is the only man in history to have tried on the original space suit worn by the first human to set foot on the moon, Neil Armstrong. Cardin loved the space suit so much, he created his own design for NASA in 1970.\n\nCardin resigned from the Chambre Syndicale in 1966 and began showing his collections in his own venue, the \"Espace Cardin\" (opened 1971) in Paris, formerly the \"Théâtre des Ambassadeurs\", near the Embassy of the United States in Paris. The Espace Cardin is also used to promote new artistic talents, like theater ensembles, musicians, and others. He was also contacted by Pakistan International Airlines to design uniforms for the flag carrier. The uniforms were introduced in 1966 to 1971 and became an instant hit.\n\nIn 1971, Cardin redesigned the Barong Tagalog, a national costume of the Philippines, by opening the front, removing the cuffs that needed cufflinks, flaring the sleeves, and minimizing the embroidery. It was also tapered to the body, in contrast with the traditional loose-fitting design and it also had a thicker collar with sharp and pointed cuffs. A straight-cut design was favored by President Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nIn 1975 Cardin opened his first furniture boutique on rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore. His furniture designs were highly inspired by his fashion designs.\n\nIn both 1977 and 1979 he was awarded the Cartier Golden Thimble by French haute couture for most creative collection of the season.\n\nHe was a member of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture et du Prêt-à-Porter from 1953 to 1993.\n\nLike many other designers today, Cardin decided in 1994 to show his collection only to a small circle of selected clients and journalists. After a break of 15 years, he showed a new collection to a group of 150 journalists at his bubble home in Cannes.\n\nPierre Cardin used his name as a brand, initially a prestigious fashion brand, then in the 1960s expanded successfully into perfumes and cosmetics. From about 1988 the brand was licensed extensively, and appeared on \"wildly nonadjacent products such as baseball caps and cigarettes\". A 2005 article in the Harvard Business Review commented that the extension into perfumes and cosmetics was successful as the premium nature of the Pierre Cardin brand transferred well into these new, adjacent categories, but that the owners of the brand mistakenly attributed this to the brand's strength rather than to its fit with the new product categories. The extensive licensing eroded the brand's credibility, but brought in much revenue; in 1986 \"Women's Wear Daily\" (WWD) estimated Cardin’s annual income at over US$10 million. 1995 quotes from WWD included \"Pierre Cardin—he has sold his name for toilet paper. At what point do you lose your identity?\" and \"Cardin’s cachet crashed when his name appeared on everything from key chains to pencil holders\". However, the Cardin name was still very profitable, although the indiscriminate licensing approach was considered a failure.\n\nIn 2011 Cardin tried to sell his business, valuing it at €1 billion, although the \"Wall Street Journal\" considered it to be worth about a fifth of that amount. Ultimately he did not sell the brand.\n\nCardin entered industrial design by developing thirteen basic design \"themes\" that would be applied to various products, each consistently recognizable and carrying his name and logo. He expanded into new markets that \"to most Paris fashion designers, it is rank heresy.\"\n\nThe business initiatives included a contract with American Motors Corporation (AMC). Following the success of the Aldo Gucci designed Hornet Sportabout station wagon interiors, the automaker incorporated Cardin's theme on the AMC Javelin starting in mid-1972. This was one of the first American cars to offer a special trim package created by a famous French fashion designer. It was daring and outlandish design \"with some of the wildest fabrics and patterns ever seen in any American car\".\n\nThe original sales estimate by AMC was for 2,500 haute couture \"pony\" and muscle cars. The special interior option was continued on the 1973 model year Javelins. During the two model years, a total of 4,152 AMC Javelins received this bold mirrored, multi-colored pleated stripe pattern in tones of Chinese red, plum, white, and silver that were set against a black background. The Cardin Javelins also came with the designer's emblems on the front fenders and had a limited selection of exterior colors (Trans Am Red, Snow White, Stardust Silver, Diamond Blue, and Wild Plum) to coordinate with the special interiors. However, 12 Cardin optioned cars were special ordered in Midnight Black paint.\n\nContinuously fascinated by geometric shapes, in 1975, Cardin applied his fetish for the bubble to a monumental domestic work which would become the Palais Bulles (the Bubble House), along with the help of architect Antti Lovag. Cardin furnished the Bubble House with his original creations. The curves of the Bubble House extend over 1,200 square metres and contain ten bedrooms decorated by contemporary artists, as well as a panoramic living room.\n\nCardin bought Maxim's restaurants in 1981 and soon opened branches in New York, London, and Beijing (1983). A chain of Maxim's Hotels (Palm Springs, California, 1986) are now included in the assets. He has also licensed a wide range of food products under that name.\n\nDuring the 1980s and until the mid-1990s, he supported a French Press organization for Music-hall, Circus, Dance and Arts presided by a well known journalist in France, , with authors or notable personalities as Guy des Cars, , Yves Mourousi and Jean-Pierre Thiollet.\n\nIn 2001, Cardin purchased the ruins of the castle in Lacoste, Vaucluse that was once inhabited by the Marquis de Sade; he has partially renovated the site and holds music or dance festivals (particularly with Marie-Claude Pietragalla) there.\n\nCardin also owns a palazzo in Venice named Ca' Bragadin. Although he has claimed in several interviews that this house was once owned by Giacomo Casanova, in reality it was the home of Giovanni Bragadin di San Cassian, Bishop of Verona and Patriarch of Venice.\n\nCardin is gay.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Postmodernists cite examples such as the situation of a Benedictine University “draft-age youth whose identity is claimed in national narratives of ‘national security’ and the universalizing narratives of the ‘rights of man,’” of “the woman whose very womb is claimed by the irresolvable contesting narratives of ‘church,’ ‘paternity,’ ‘economy,’ and ‘liberal polity.’ In these cases, postmodernists argue that there are no fixed categories, stable sets of values, or common sense meanings to be understood in their scholarly exploration.\n\nIn these margins, postmodernists believe that people resist realist concepts of power which is repressive, in order to maintain a claim on their own identity. What makes this resistance significant is that among the aspects of power resisted is that which forces individuals to take a single identity or to be subject to a particular interpretation. Meaning and interpretation in these types of situations is always uncertain; arbitrary in fact. The power in effect here is not that of oppression, but that of the cultural and social implications around them, which creates the framework within which they see themselves, which creates the boundaries of their possible courses of action.\n\nPostmodern political scientists, such as Richard Ashley, claim that in these marginal sites it is impossible to construct a coherent narrative, or story, about what is really taking place without including contesting and contradicting narratives, and still have a “true” story from the perspective of a “sovereign subject,” who can dictate the values pertinent to the “meaning” of the situation. In fact, it is possible here to deconstruct the idea of meaning. Ashley attempts to reveal the ambiguity of texts, especially Western texts, how the texts themselves can be seen as \"sites of conflict\" within a given culture or worldview. By regarding them in this way, deconstructive readings attempt to uncover evidence of ancient cultural biases, conflicts, lies, tyrannies, and power structures, such as the tensions and ambiguity between peace and war, lord and subject, male and female, which serve as further examples of Derrida's binary oppositions in which the first element is privileged, or considered prior to and more authentic, in relation to the second. Examples of postmodern political scientists include post-colonial writers such as Frantz Fanon, feminist writers such as Cynthia Enloe, and postpositive theorists such as Ashley and James Der Derian.\n\n"}
{"id": "529709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=529709", "title": "Precisionism", "text": "Precisionism\n\nPrecisionism was the first indigenous modern art movement in the United States and an early American contribution to the rise of Modernism. The Precisionist style, which first emerged after World War I and was at the height of its popularity during the 1920s and early 1930s, celebrated the new American landscape of skyscrapers, bridges, and factories in a form that has also been called \"Cubist-Realism.\" The term \"Precisionism\" was first coined in the mid-1920s, possibly by Museum of Modern Art director Alfred H. Barr. Painters working in this style were also known as the \"Immaculates,\" which was the more commonly used term at the time. The stiffness of both art-historical labels suggests the difficulties contemporary critics had in attempting to characterize these artists.\n\nInfluenced by Cubism and Futurism, Precisionism took for its main themes industrialisation and the modernization of the American landscape, the structures of which were depicted in precise, sharply defined geometrical forms. Precisionist artists considered themselves strictly American and some were reluctant to acknowledge their European artistic influences. Yet it was readily apparent at the time that the fracturing of planes in many Precisionist paintings originates in the Cubism of Picasso and Léger; similarly, Precisionist renderings of shafts of light as rigidly drawn \"lines of force\" is a clear borrowing from Futurism. In the end, Precisionism was less about pure originality of expression and more about an energetic American use and amalgamation of certain European modernist techniques. Part of precisionism's originality is found in its subject matter and outlook.\n\nThere is a degree of reverence for the industrial age in the movement, but social commentary was not fundamental to the style. Like Pop Art, Precisionism has on occasion been interpreted as a criticism of the de-natured society it portrays, though its artists did not often feel comfortable with this reading of their work. Elsie Driggs' \"Pittsburgh\" (1926) illustrates this gap in perception. A painting of black and gray steel-mill smokestacks, thick piping, and crisscrossing wires, with only clouds of smoke to relieve the severity of the image, viewers have been tempted to see this dark painting as a statement of environmental concern. To the contrary, Driggs always claimed that she intended an ironic beauty in the image and referred to it as \"my El Greco.\" Upon seeing the painting, Charles Daniel dubbed her \"one of the new classicists.\" More often than not, Precisionism implicitly celebrated man-made dynamism and new technologies. Possible exceptions to this statement are some of the darker, more claustrophobic city paintings of Louis Lozowick and the comic anti-capitalist satires of Preston Dickinson.\n\nAs might be expected, varying degrees of abstraction are found in Precisionist works. \"The Figure 5 in Gold\" (1928) by Charles Demuth, a clamorous hommage to William Carlos Williams' imagist poem about a fire truck is abstract and stylized, while the paintings of Charles Sheeler sometimes verge on a form of photorealism. (In addition to his meticulously detailed paintings like \"River Rouge Plant\" and \"American Landscape\", Sheeler, like his friend Paul Strand, also created sharp-focus photographs of factories and public buildings.) The majority of Precisionist paintings and drawings, however, present no obstacles in identifying their imagery. Some Precisionist work tended toward a \"highly controlled approach to technique and form\" as well as an application of \"hard-edged style to long-familiar American scenes\". Precisionist artists aimed to convey the geometric and psychological essence of a scene or a structure but intended that essence to be almost immediately accessible.\n\nMost Precisionist imagery is urban: office towers, apartment houses, bridges, tunnels, subway platforms, streets, the skyline and grid of the modern city. Other artists, however, such as Charles Demuth, Niles Spencer, Ralston Crawford, Sanford Ross, and Charles Sheeler, applied the same approach to more pastoral settings and painted starkly geometric renderings of barns, cottages, country roads, and farm houses. Artists such as Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy painted Precisionist still lifes as well.\n\nMany American artists worked in a Precisionist style over a twenty-year period. George Ault, Ralston Crawford, Francis Criss, Stuart Davis, Charles Demuth, Preston Dickinson, Elsie Driggs, Louis Lozowick, Gerald Murphy, Charles Sheeler, Niles Spencer, Morton Schamberg and Joseph Stella, were among the most prominent Precisionists. Examples of their work can be found in most major American museum collections. Dale Nichols, Millard Sheets, Virginia Berresford, Henry Billings, Peter Blume, Stefan Hirsch, Edmund Lewandowski, John Storrs, Miklos Suba, Sandor Bernath, Herman Trunk, Arnold Wiltz, Clarence Holbrook Carter, Edgar Corbridge and the photographers Paul Strand and Lewis Hine were other artists associated with Precisionism. The movement had no major presence outside the United States, although it did influence Australian art where Jeffrey Smart adopted its principles. Although no manifesto was ever created, some of the artists were friends and frequently exhibited at the same galleries. Georgia O'Keeffe, especially with paintings like \"New York City with Moon\" (1926) and \"The Shelton With Sun Spots\" (1926), created her own more sensuous version of Precisionism, although her best-known works are not closely related to Precisionism, and it would be inaccurate to state that O'Keeffe (who vehemently resisted movement ties) was closely aligned with the Precisionist movement. Her husband, photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, was a highly regarded mentor for the group and was especially supportive of Paul Strand.\n\nPrecisionist art would have an indirect influence on the later styles known as magic realism, pop art, and photorealism, but it was largely considered a dated \"period style\" by the 1950s, though its influence on advertising imagery and stage and set design continued throughout the twentieth century. Its two most famous practitioners are Charles Demuth and Charles Sheeler.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Many rituals and rites use rice as a medium, but at some point in ancient Anatolia artisans who were skilled in making miniature paintings decided to turn their skill to making art with what had always been an ancient symbol of prosperity, the oldest example of which lies in Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, Turkey. The artisans would inscribe messages or names on a single grain of rice after it was treated and polished. Grains that were long and flat were favorites as they offered proper surfaces for writing. Apart from Turkey, India also had a large number of artisans skilled in making miniature art including rice art.\n\nRice art is considered to bring good luck hence some of its most popular forms is good luck pendants, hope bracelets and cell phone charms.\n\nWithin time rice writing and rice art evolved, soon creating rice jewelry where the rice grain was enclosed in a vial with a liquid/oil that magnifies the individual grain making it easier to appreciate the painstaking and intricate details. This went further with rice jewelry like good luck pendants, charm bracelets, anklets and earrings. In modern times most of these artisans and artists set up shop with street side stalls where they can personally write your message or name on a rice grain while displaying their wares and hard work.\n\nMost modern day rice writers use the following tools: \n\nOnce the rice writing is complete, it is usually preserved in a small vial of liquid/oil.

Darrell Hammond has portrayed him the longest, originally while in the cast in the late 1990s, and then reprising the role in a series of cameos in 2016. The other cast-members held the role briefly, with five appearances by Hartman, three by Killam, and only one by Sudeikis. Since October 2016, the role has been played by Alec Baldwin, who has made many appearances on the series through its run.\n\n\"SNL\" has frequently paired parodies of Trump with impressions of his wives and children or, since he took office, various staff-members. Trump has hosted the show twice, in 2004 and 2015, the latter time as a candidate.\n\nCast member Phil Hartman was the show's first portrayer of Donald Trump, from 1988 until 1990. Hartman portrayed Trump five times, and was paired with Jan Hooks as Trump's then-wife Ivana Trump or, in one case, Marla Maples, Trump's second-wife-to-be.\n\nThe first sketch, from December 1988, shows Donald and Ivana celebrating Christmas, giving large, gold and jewel-encrusted presents to each other.\n\nTrump is seen in the audience at the \"Saturday Night Live 15th Anniversary Special\" from 1989, where Chevy Chase spills popcorn on him.\n\nA sketch from February 1990 parodies the Ivana Trump divorce. Ivana demands more money since Donald has been unfaithful, but he refutes this by referring to their extensive prenuptial agreement. It states, among other things, that he is entitled to have mistresses provided they are younger than she is, and that she will be paid in giant stonecoins.\n\nThe next episode had Marla Maples and Trump appearing on \"Church Chat\". The couple are referred to as a \"satanic sandwich\", and the sketch shows press coverage of their relationship, including a \"Best Sex I've Ever Had\" headline.\n\nHartman did not do more Trump-sketches after 1990, and Darrell Hammond's first two portrayals came in 1999. The first sketch had Ross Perot (Cheri Oteri) searching for \"a new crazy leader\" for the Reform Party, with Trump and Pat Buchanan (Chris Parnell) as possible candidates. Their meeting is crashed by a violent Jesse Ventura (Will Ferrell). In the second sketch Trump announces that he is running for president and tells the audience, \"Eh, don't try to fight it. Alright?\" He also introduces his running mate, \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" winner John Carpenter.\n\nHammond resumed playing Trump in 2004, doing so a total of 16 times up to 2011, although he left the cast in 2009. His parodies focused on Trump's interest and involvement with politics, commercials, and his appearances on \"The Apprentice\". Trump hosted the show in April 2004, praising Hammond in his opening monologue, and appeared in a sketch next to Hammond's Trump.\n\nAn early 2005 episode introduced Trump's third wife, Melania (Paris Hilton). Trump brings her home to let his children, Eric Trump (Fred Armisen), Donald Trump Jr. (Seth Meyers), and Ivanka Trump (Maya Rudolph), \"meet their new mommy\". Melania would be portrayed later by Molly Shannon and, from 2015 and onward (without Hammond), by Cecily Strong.\n\nHammond is the show's longest running Trump impersonator. He played the role for ten years in the cast, 1999 to 2009, and reprised it twice in 2011. In the 2011 sketches Trump involves himself in the upcoming Republican Party presidential primaries and questions President Obama's birth certificate.\n\nAfter returning to serve as the show's announcer in 2014, he began reprising his role as Trump regularly, beginning in December 2015. Due to the wide field of GOP candidates in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the show needed at least one cameo appearance to cover all of the candidates. Taran Killam, who at this point had begun playing Trump, switched to portraying Ted Cruz. \"SNL\" had asked alumnus Jimmy Fallon (who had portrayed Trump on his own show) to play the part. When a last minute change prevented this, Hammond returned to the role. Cecily Strong, who had portrayed Melania opposite Killam's Trump, continued in this role alongside Hammond.\n\nHammond subsequently appeared as Trump in seven more episodes of the season. His appearance in the role was critically acclaimed, but some outlets reported that the role should be moved to a permanent cast member at some point.\n\nJason Sudeikis appeared in the role once, during a \"Fox & Friends\" parody. Sudeikis' Trump comments on Barack Obama's handling of Hurricane Sandy.\n\nIt was announced prior to the show's forty-first season that Taran Killam would be taking over the role for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Reportedly, several cast members had auditioned for the role.\n\nKillam's Trump debuted on the October 2015 sketch \"A Message From Donald & Melania Trump\", which also introduced Cecily Strong as Melania Trump. The message is sent from \"our humble gold house\", and Donald presents himself as \"the man who's almost certainly your next president\". The couple praise Donald's qualities as a person and a politician, although he becomes uncomfortable when she claims that he \"was democrat before he was republican\". The duo reprised the setup and characters in December, wishing viewers a Merry Christmas and presenting a \"Naughty and Nice\" list. Donald placed Santa on the \"naughty\" list since he doesn't trust anybody who can fly over a wall.\n\nDonald Trump hosted \"SNL\" a second time in November 2015, and Killam and Hammond appeared during the opening monologue alongside him. Since Trump was running for president, his appearance triggered the equal-time rule, so his opponents received free air time on NBC affiliate stations.\nTrump appeared in a sketch portraying him as an incredibly successful president in 2018. Cecily Strong parodied Melania, and Trump's daughter Ivanka appeared in a cameo. Trump ends the sketch by telling the audience that his \"actual\" presidency would be even better. Trump is one of 17 presidential candidates who have appeared on Saturday Night Live, and the only American President to have hosted the show. Killam later expressed regret and shame for what he referred to as \"normalizing\" Trump's candidacy.\n\nFor the December 19, 2015 episode (co-hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler), \"SNL\" lacked enough cast members to portray all of the GOP candidates in a debate sketch. As a result, Jimmy Fallon was asked to return in the role of Trump (which he had played many times on \"The Tonight Show\") so that Killam could portray Ted Cruz instead. Ultimately, that plan fell through at the last minute, and instead, Hammond played Trump in the debate.\n\nHammond continued to play Trump for the remainder of the season. Killam's contract was terminated early after that season, with some news sources alleging that being replaced as Trump was part of the reason.\n\nIn September 2016, \"SNL\" announced that Alec Baldwin would replace Hammond in portraying Trump in its parodies of the 2016 presidential debates. Hammond had not expected this, and was very shaken by the replacement. Baldwin has continued portraying Trump in 2017. Unlike his predecessors, he has never been a cast-member, but as of February 2017 he has hosted the show 17 times, more than anyone else. Baldwin received a Critics' Choice Award and a Primetime Emmy Award for his portrayal of Trump.\n\nBaldwin's Trump debuted in the October 1, 2016 episode, opposite Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton and Michael Che as debate moderator Lester Holt. The sketch was based on the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump. The episode also included impressions of members of Trump's family in a parody of the game show \"Family Feud\".\n\nFurther sketches with Baldwin included elements of the other presidential debates, the vice presidential debate, and the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording controversy.\n\nThe October 15 episode featured a parody of the third presidential debate.\nLater in the episode, Baldwin and Cecily Strong appeared as Donald and Melania Trump, in a parody of Beyoncé's \"Lemonade\". Host Emily Blunt portrayed Ivanka Trump, and Vanessa Bayer appeared as Trump's youngest daughter Tiffany Trump.\n\nTrump reacted negatively to this episode on Twitter, saying that Baldwin's portrayal \"stinks\", and that it was \"time to retire the boring and unfunny show.\"\n\nPost-election sketches have included Baldwin's Trump meeting with people such as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mitt Romney, and Vladimir Putin, with humor drawn from the 2016 United States election interference by Russia.

These include Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway (Kate McKinnon), White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon (Mikey Day) with a Grim Reaper-like appearance, White House Press Secretaries Sean Spicer (Melissa McCarthy), and Sarah Huckabee Sanders (Aidy Bryant), and United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions (Kate McKinnon).

{"id": "26343691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26343691", "title": "Story Workshop", "text": "Story Workshop\n\nThe Story Workshop Method is a method of teaching writing originated in 1965 by John Schultz. The Story Workshop Institute was founded to bring the method to elementary and secondary classrooms and other forums for writing instruction. The former Fiction Writing Department at Columbia College Chicago used this methodology in its core writing course progression, and \"Hair Trigger\" is its award-winning annual of student fiction and creative nonfiction writing.\n\nThe Story Workshop method \"focuses on helping you hear your own individual voice and provides a supportive, interactive, and challenging environment for developing your reading, writing, listening, speaking, critical thinking, and imaginative problem-solving capacities.\"\n\nThe Story Workshop Method differs from critique-based writing pedagogy in that it focuses upon developing one's writing process, trusting that a good writing process will lead to good writing. Story Workshop instructors are called \"Directors\" and they coach students through different parts of the writing process during class, such as:\n\n\"You can identify the Story Workshop method of teaching writing by its structured, flexible time-period format; by its theory of seeing and voice; by its repertoire of oral word, oral telling, oral reading, writing and recall exercises; by its semicircle format, which heightens and facilitates the group process and the sense of audience; and by its teaching approaches, techniques, strategies, and tactics made possible by the exercises and their many variations. Used in class sessions and in one-to-one tutorial sessions, the Story Workshop method assumes that all forms of writing derive from image and story, from image and movement of voice organizing the expression of perceptions through time. The development of these human perceptual, imaginative, and verbal capacities through their many derivations in oral and written forms is always the Story Workshop objective.\" From \"The Story Workshop Method Writing From Start to Finish,\" by John Schultz\n\nThe Story Workshop pedagogy aims to allow writers to move beyond dependence upon the instructor and the classroom. With the emphasis upon process development, Story Workshop Methodology sometimes frustrates students who are used to a pedagogical model that features red pen markings on their papers and direct negative criticism as its primary form of feedback. When feedback instead comes in coaching from the instructor during activities, in what classmates are able to recall (retell with a full sense of storytelling detail), and questions that the instructor or peers ask—all of which require some decision-making and responsibility from the writer—such a student will react negatively, claiming that the method \"doesn't give any feedback.\" Successful students develop the ability to internalize various coachings heard in class, to read published literature with a critical eye and apply the techniques and approaches gleaned to his or her own writing, to use, and, where necessary and appropriate, combine a wide variety of prose forms and points-of-view in their writing, and to rewrite with a solid sense of what a particular manuscript needs.\n\nThe Story Workshop approach has been used on all levels and is modified to meet the needs of each level. In cases that have been tested comprehensively comparing results from classes of several teachers (in a major urban community college system over fourteen full semesters) 90% of the Story Workshop trained students passed a rigorous post-test successfully (two hours of argumentative writing), while only 50% to 70% of students from other traditional and ad hoc composition classes in the same college passed the test.\n\nThese writers have taken and instructed Story Workshop classes:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23958411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23958411", "title": "Techno", "text": "Techno\n\nTechno is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the mid-to-late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word \"techno\" in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of sub-genres have been built.\n\nIn Detroit, techno resulted from the melding of black styles including Chicago house, funk, electro, and electric jazz with electronic music by artists such as Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder, and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Added to this is the influence of futuristic and fictional themes relevant to life in American late capitalist society, with Alvin Toffler's book \"The Third Wave\" being a notable point of reference. Pioneering producer and DJ Juan Atkins cites Toffler's phrase \"techno rebels\" as inspiring him to use the word \"techno\" to describe the musical style he helped to create. This unique blend of influences aligns techno with the aesthetic referred to as afrofuturism.To producers such as Derrick May, the transference of spirit from the body to the machine is often a central preoccupation; essentially an expression of technological spirituality. In this manner: \"techno dance music defeats what Adorno saw as the alienating effect of mechanisation on the modern consciousness\".\n\nStylistically, techno is generally repetitive instrumental music, often produced for use in a continuous DJ set. The central rhythmic component is most often in common time (4/4), where time is marked with a bass drum on each quarter note pulse, a backbeat played by snare or clap on the second and fourth pulses of the bar, and an open hi-hat sounding every second eighth note. The tempo tends to vary between approximately 120 to 150 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the style of techno. The creative use of music production technology, such as drum machines, synthesizers, and digital audio workstations, is viewed as an important aspect of the music's aesthetic. Many producers use retro electronic musical devices to create what they consider to be an authentic techno sound. Drum machines from the 1980s such as Roland's TR-808 and TR-909 are highly prized, and software emulations of such retro technology are popular among techno producers.\n\nMusic journalists and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term; so a clear distinction can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles, such as tech house and trance.\n\nThe initial blueprint for techno developed during the mid-1980s in Belleville, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit by Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson and Derrick May (the so-called The Belleville Three), all of whom attended school together at Belleville High, with the addition of Eddie Fowlkes, Blake Baxter and James Pennington. By the close of the 1980s, the pioneers had recorded and released material under various guises: Atkins as Model 500, Flintstones, and Magic Juan; Fowlkes simply as Eddie \"Flashin\" Fowlkes; Saunderson as Reeses, Keynotes, and Kaos; with May as Mayday, R-Tyme, and Rhythim Is Rhythim. There were also a number of joint ventures, including Kevin Saunderson's group Inner City, which saw collaborations with Atkins, May, vocalist Paris Grey, and fellow DJs James Pennington and [Arthur Forest]. The Electrifying Mojo was the first radio DJ to play music by Atkins, May, and Saunderson. Mojo refused to follow pre-established radio formats or playlists, and he promoted social and cultural awareness of the African American community.\nIn exploring techno's origins writer Kodwo Eshun maintains that \"Kraftwerk are to Techno what Muddy Waters is to the Rolling Stones: the authentic, the origin, the real.\" Juan Atkins has acknowledged that he had an early enthusiasm for Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder, particularly Moroder's work with Donna Summer and the producer's own album \"E=MC.\" Atkins also mentions that \"around 1980 I had a tape of nothing but Kraftwerk, Telex, Devo, Giorgio Moroder and Gary Numan, and I'd ride around in my car playing it.\" Atkins has also claimed he was unaware of Kraftwerk's music prior to his collaboration with Richard \"3070\" Davis as Cybotron, which was two years after he had first started experimenting with electronic instruments. Regarding his initial impression of Kraftwerk, Atkins notes that they were \"clean and precise\" relative to the \"weird UFO sounds\" featured in his seemingly \"psychedelic\" music.\n\nDerrick May identified the influence of Kraftwerk and other European synthesizer music in commenting that \"it was just classy and clean, and to us it was beautiful, like outer space. Living around Detroit, there was so little beauty... everything is an ugly mess in Detroit, and so we were attracted to this music. It, like, ignited our imagination!\". May has commented that he considered his music a direct continuation of the European synthesizer tradition. He also identified Japanese synthpop act Yellow Magic Orchestra, particularly member Ryuichi Sakamoto, and British band Ultravox, as influences, along with Kraftwerk. YMO's song \"Technopolis\" (1979), a tribute to Tokyo as an electronic mecca, is considered an \"interesting contribution\" to the development of Detroit techno, foreshadowing concepts that Atkins and Davis would later explore with Cybotron.\n\nKevin Saunderson has also acknowledged the influence of Europe but he claims to have been more inspired by the idea of making music with electronic equipment: \"I was more infatuated with the idea that I can do this all myself.\"\n\nPrior to achieving notoriety, Atkins, Saunderson, May, and Fowlkes shared common interests as budding musicians, \"mix\" tape traders, and aspiring DJs. They also found musical inspiration via the \"Midnight Funk Association,\" an eclectic five-hour late-night radio program hosted on various Detroit radio stations, including WCHB, WGPR, and WJLB-FM from 1977 through the mid-1980s by DJ Charles \"The Electrifying Mojo\" Johnson. Mojo's show featured electronic music by artists such as Giorgio Moroder, Kraftwerk, Yellow Magic Orchestra and Tangerine Dream, alongside the funk sounds of acts such as Parliament Funkadelic and dance oriented new wave music by bands like Devo and the B-52's. Atkins has noted: \n\nDespite the short-lived disco boom in Detroit, it had the effect of inspiring many individuals to take up mixing, Juan Atkins among them. Subsequently, Atkins taught May how to mix records, and in 1981, \"Magic Juan\", Derrick \"Mayday\", in conjunction with three other DJ's, one of whom was Eddie \"Flashin\" Fowlkes, launched themselves as a party crew called Deep Space Soundworks (also referred to as Deep Space). In 1980 or 1981 they met with Mojo and proposed that they provide mixes for his show, which they did end up doing the following year.\n\nDuring the late 1970s-early 1980s high school clubs such as Brats, Charivari, Ciabattino, Comrades, Gables, Hardwear, Rafael, Rumours, Snobs, and Weekends created the incubator in which techno was grown. These young promoters developed and nurtured the local dance music scene by both catering to the tastes of the local audience of young people and by marketing parties with new DJs and their music. As these local clubs grew in popularity, groups of DJs began to band together to market their mixing skills and sound systems to the clubs in order to cater to the growing audiences of listeners. Locations like local church activity centers, vacant warehouses, offices, and YMCA auditoriums were the early locations where underage crowds gathered and the musical form was nurtured and defined.\n\nOf the four individuals responsible for establishing techno as a genre in its own right, Juan Atkins is widely cited as \"The Originator\". Atkins' role was likewise acknowledged in 1995 by the American music technology publication \"Keyboard Magazine\", which honoured Atkins as one of \"12 Who Count\" in the history of keyboard music.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Atkins began recording with musical partner Richard Davis (and later with a third member, Jon-5) as Cybotron. This trio released a number of rock and electro-inspired tunes, the most successful of which were \"Clear\" (1983) and its moodier followup, \"Techno City\" (1984).\n\nAccording to a recent bio on MySpace, Atkins claims to have \"coined the term techno to describe their music, taking as one inspiration the works of Futurist and author Alvin Toffler, from whom he borrowed the terms 'cybotron' and 'metroplex.' Atkins has used the term to describe earlier bands that made heavy use of synthesizers, such as Kraftwerk, although many people would consider Kraftwerk's music and Juan's early music in Cybotron as electro.\" Atkins viewed Cybotron's \"Cosmic Cars\" (1982) as unique, Germanic, synthesized funk, but he later heard Afrika Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock\" (1982) and considered it to be a superior example of the music he envisioned. Inspired, he resolved to continue experimenting, and he encouraged Saunderson and May to do likewise.\n\nEventually, Atkins started producing his own music under the pseudonym Model 500, and in 1985 he established the record label Metroplex. The same year saw an important turning point for the Detroit scene with the release of Model 500's \"No UFOs,\" a seminal work that is generally considered the first techno production. Of this time, Atkins has said: \n\nThe early producers, enabled by the increasing affordability of sequencers and synthesizers, merged a European synthpop aesthetic with aspects of soul, funk, disco, and electro, pushing electronic dance music into uncharted terrain. They deliberately rejected the Motown legacy and traditional formulas of R&B and soul, and instead embraced technological experimentation.\n\nThe resulting Detroit sound was interpreted by Derrick May and one journalist in 1988 as a \"post-soul\" sound with no debt to Motown, but by another journalist a decade later as \"soulful grooves\" melding the beat-centric styles of Motown with the music technology of the time. May famously described the sound of techno as something that is \"...like Detroit...a complete mistake. It's like George Clinton and Kraftwerk are stuck in an elevator with only a sequencer to keep them company.\" Juan Atkins has stated that it is \"music that sounds like technology, and not technology that sounds like music, meaning that most of the music you listen to is made with technology, whether you know it or not. But with techno music, you know it.\"\n\nOne of the first Detroit productions to receive wider attention was Derrick May's \"Strings of Life\" (1987), which, together with May's previous release, \"Nude Photo\" (1987), helped raise techno's profile in Europe, especially the UK and Germany, during the 1987–1988 house music boom (see Second Summer of Love). It became May's best known track, which, according to Frankie Knuckles, \"just exploded. It was like something you can't imagine, the kind of power and energy people got off that record when it was first heard. Mike Dunn says he has no idea how people can accept a record that doesn't have a bassline.\"\n\nThe Detroit sound exerted an influence on widely differing styles of electronic music, yet it also maintained an identity as a genre in its own right, one now commonly referred to as \"Detroit techno\".\n\nThe music's producers, especially May and Saunderson, admit to having been fascinated by the Chicago club scene and influenced by house in particular. May's 1987/1989 hit \"Strings of Life\" (released under the alias Rhythim Is Rhythim) is considered a classic in both the house and techno genres.\n\nJuan Atkins also believes that the first acid house producers, seeking to distance house music from disco, emulated the techno sound. Atkins also suggests that the Chicago house sound developed as a result of Frankie Knuckles' using a drum machine he bought from Derrick May. He claims: \n\nIn the UK, a club following for house music grew steadily from 1985, with interest sustained by scenes in London, Manchester, Nottingham, and later Sheffield and Leeds. The DJs thought to be responsible for house's early UK success include Mike Pickering, Mark Moore, Colin Faver, and Graeme Park.\n\nBy 1988, house music had exploded in the UK, and acid house was increasingly popular. There was also a long-established warehouse party subculture based around the sound system scene. In 1988, the music played at warehouse parties was predominantly house. That same year, the Balearic party vibe associated with Ibiza-based DJ Alfredo Fiorito was transported to London, when Danny Rampling and Paul Oakenfold opened the clubs Shoom and Spectrum, respectively. Both night spots quickly became synonymous with acid house, and it was during this period that the use of MDMA, as a party drug, started to gain prominence. Other important UK clubs at this time included Back to Basics in Leeds, Sheffield's Leadmill and Music Factory, and in Manchester The Haçienda, where Mike Pickering and Graeme Park's Friday night spot, Nude, was an important proving ground for American underground dance music. Acid house party fever escalated in London and Manchester, and it quickly became a cultural phenomenon. MDMA-fueled club goers, faced with 2 A.M. closing hours, sought refuge in the warehouse party scene that ran all night. To escape the attention of the press and the authorities, this after-hours activity quickly went underground. Within a year, however, up to 10,000 people at a time were attending the first commercially organized mass parties, called \"raves\", and a media storm ensued.\n\nThe success of house and acid house paved the way for wider acceptance of the Detroit sound, and vice versa: techno was initially supported by a handful of house music clubs in Chicago, New York, and Northern England, with London clubs catching up later; but in 1987, it was \"Strings of Life\" which eased London club-goers into acceptance of house, according to DJ Mark Moore.\n\nThe explosion of interest in underground dance music during the late 1980s provided a context for the development of techno as an identifiable genre. The mid-1988 UK release of \"Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit\", an album compiled by ex-Northern Soul DJ and Kool Kat Records boss Neil Rushton (at the time an A&R scout for Virgin's \"10 Records\" imprint) and Derrick May, was an important milestone and marked the introduction of the word \"techno\" in reference to a specific genre of music. Although the compilation put \"techno\" into the lexicon of music journalism, the music was, for a time, sometimes characterized as Detroit's high-tech interpretation of Chicago house rather than a relatively pure genre unto itself. In fact, the compilation's working title had been \"The House Sound of Detroit\" until the addition of Atkins' song \"Techno Music\" prompted reconsideration. Rushton was later quoted as saying he, Atkins, May, and Saunderson came up with the compilation's final name together, and that the Belleville Three voted down calling the music some kind of regional brand of house; they instead favored a term they were already using, \"techno\".\n\nDerrick May views this as one of his busiest times and recalls that it was a period where he \n\nCommercially, the release did not fare as well as expected, and it failed to recoup, however Inner City's production \"Big Fun\" (1988), a track that was almost not included on the compilation, became a massive crossover hit in fall 1988. The record was also responsible for bringing industry attention to May, Atkins and Saunderson, which led to discussions with ZTT records about forming a techno supergroup called \"Intellex.\" But, when the group were on the verge of finalising their contract, May allegedly refused to agree to Top of the Pops appearances and negotiations collapsed. According to May, ZTT label boss Trevor Horn had envisaged that the trio would be marketed as a \"black Petshop Boys.\" \n\nDespite Virgin Records' disappointment with the poor sales of Rushton's compilation, the record was successful in establishing an identity for techno and was instrumental in creating a platform in Europe for both the music and its producers. Ultimately, the release served to distinguish the Detroit sound from Chicago house and other forms of underground dance music that were emerging during the rave era of the late 1980s and early 1990s, a period during which techno became more adventurous and distinct.\n\nIn mid-1988, developments in the Detroit scene led to the opening of a nightclub called the Music Institute (MI), located at 1315 Broadway in downtown Detroit. The venue was secured by George Baker and Alton Miller with Darryl Wynn and Derrick May participating as Friday night DJs, and Baker and Chez Damier playing to a mostly gay crowd on Saturday nights.\n\nThe club closed on November 24, 1989, with Derrick May playing \"Strings of Life\" along with a recording of clock tower bells. May explains:\n\nThough short-lived, MI was known internationally for its all-night sets, its sparse white rooms, and its juice bar stocked with \"smart drinks\" (the Institute never served liquor). The MI, notes Dan Sicko, along with Detroit's early techno pioneers, \"helped give life to one of the city's important musical subcultures – one that was slowly growing into an international scene.\"\n\nAs the original sound evolved in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it also diverged to such an extent that a wide spectrum of stylistically distinct music was being referred to as techno. This ranged from relatively pop oriented acts such as Moby to the distinctly anti-commercial sentiments of Underground Resistance. Derrick May's experimentation on works such as \"Beyond the Dance\" (1989) and \"The Beginning\" (1990) were credited with taking techno \"in dozens of new directions at once and having the kind of expansive impact John Coltrane had on Jazz\". The Birmingham-based label Network Records label was instrumental in introducing Detroit techno to British audiences. By the early 1990s, the original techno sound had garnered a large underground following in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The growth of techno's popularity in Europe between 1988 and 1992 was largely due to the emergence of the rave scene and a thriving club culture.\n\nIn America, apart from regional scenes in Detroit, New York City, Chicago, and Orlando interest was limited. Producers from Detroit, frustrated by the lack of opportunity in their home country, looked to Europe for their future livelihood. This first wave of Detroit expatriates was soon joined by a number of up-and-coming artists, the so-called \"second wave\", including Carl Craig, Octave One, Jay Denham, Kenny Larkin, and Stacey Pullen, with UR's Jeff Mills, Mike Banks, and Robert Hood pushing their own unique sound. A number of New York producers were also making an impression at this time, notably Frankie Bones, Lenny Dee, and Joey Beltram. In the same period, close to Detroit (Windsor, Ontario), Richie Hawtin, with business partner John Acquaviva, launched the influential imprint Plus 8 Records.\n\nDevelopments in American-produced techno between 1990 and 1992 fueled the expansion and eventual divergence of techno in Europe, particularly in Germany. In Berlin, following the closure of a free party venue called Ufo, the club Tresor opened in 1991. The venue was for a time the standard bearer for techno and played host to many of the leading Detroit producers, some of whom relocated to Berlin. By 1993, as interest in techno in the UK club scene started to wane, Berlin was considered the unofficial \"techno capital\" of Europe.\n\nAlthough eclipsed by Germany, Belgium was another focus of second-wave techno in this time period. The Ghent-based label R&S Records embraced harder-edged techno by \"teenage prodigies\" like Beltram and C.J. Bolland, releasing \"tough, metallic tracks...with harsh, discordant synth lines that sounded like distressed Hoovers,\" according to one music journalist.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Sub Club opening in Glasgow in 1987 and Trade which opened its doors to Londoners in 1990 were pioneering venues which helped bring techno into the country. Both clubs were praised for their late opening hours and party-focused clientele. Trade has often been referred to as the 'original all night bender'.\n\nGermany's engagement with American underground dance music during the 1980s paralleled that in the UK. By 1987 a German party scene based around the Chicago sound was well established. The following year (1988) saw acid house making as significant an impact on popular consciousness in Germany as it had in England. In 1989 German DJs Westbam and Dr. Motte established the \"Ufo club\", an illegal party venue, and co-founded the Love Parade. After the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November 1989, free underground techno parties mushroomed in East Berlin, and a rave scene comparable to that in the UK was established. East German DJ Paul van Dyk has remarked that techno was a major force in reestablishing social connections between East and West Germany during the unification period.\nIn 1991 a number of party venues closed, including \"Ufo\", and the Berlin Techno scene centered itself around three locations close to the foundations of the Berlin Wall: \"Planet\" (later renamed \"E-Werk\" by Paul van Dyk), \"Der Bunker\", and the relatively long-lived \"Tresor\". It was in Tresor at this time that a trend in paramilitary clothing was established (amongst the techno fraternity) by a DJ called Tanith; possibly as an expression of a commitment to the underground aesthetic of the music, or perhaps influenced by UR's paramilitary posturing. In the same period, German DJs began intensifying the speed and abrasiveness of the sound, as an acid infused techno began transmuting into hardcore. DJ Tanith commented at the time that \"Berlin was always hardcore, hardcore hippie, hardcore punk, and now we have a very hardcore house sound.\" This emerging sound is thought to have been influenced by Dutch gabber and Belgian hardcore; styles that were in their own perverse way paying homage to Underground Resistance and Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 Records. Other influences on the development of this style were European Electronic Body Music (EBM) groups of the mid-1980s such as DAF, Front 242, and Nitzer Ebb.\n\nChanges were also taking place in Frankfurt during the same period but it did not share the egalitarian approach found in the Berlin party scene. It was instead very much centred around discothèques and existing arrangements with various club owners. In 1988, after the opened, the Frankfurt dance music scene was allegedly dominated by the club's management and they made it difficult for other promoters to get a start. By the early 1990s Sven Väth had become perhaps the first DJ in Germany to be worshipped like a rock star. He performed centre stage with his fans facing him, and as co-owner of Omen, he is believed to have been the first techno DJ to run his own club. One of the few real alternatives then was The Bruckenkopf in Mainz, underneath a Rhine bridge, a venue that offered a non-commercial alternative to Frankfurt's discothèque-based clubs. Other notable underground parties were those run by and & from Playhouse records (). By 1992 & were running a Sunday morning session at Dorian Gray, a plush discothèque near the Frankfurt airport. They initially played a mix of different styles including Belgian new beat, Deep House, Chicago House, and synthpop such as Kraftwerk and Yello and it was out of this blend of styles that the Frankfurt trance scene is believed to have emerged.\n\nIn 1993-94 rave became a mainstream music phenomenon in Germany, seeing with it a return to \"melody, New Age elements, insistently kitsch harmonies and timbres\". This undermining of the German underground sound lead to the consolidation of a German \"rave establishment,\" spearheaded by the party organisation Mayday, with its record label Low Spirit, DJ Westbam, Marusha, and a music channel called VIVA. At this time the German popular music charts were riddled with Low Spirit \"pop-Tekno\" German folk music reinterpretations of tunes such as \"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\" and \"Tears Don't Lie\", many of which became hits. At the same time, in Frankfurt, a supposed alternative was a music characterised by Simon Reynolds as \"moribund, middlebrow Electro-Trance music, as represented by Frankfurt's own Sven Väth and his Harthouse label.\" \n\nIn Germany, fans started to refer to the harder techno sound emerging in the early 1990s as \"\" (or \"Bretter\"). This alternative spelling, with varying numbers of \"k\"s, began as a tongue-in-cheek attempt to emphasize the music's hardness, but by the mid-1990s it came to be associated with a controversial point of view that the music was and perhaps always had been wholly separate from Detroit's \"techno\", deriving instead from a 1980s EBM-oriented club scene cultivated in part by DJ/musician Talla 2XLC in Frankfurt. Talla, in the early to mid-1980s, worked in City Music at Frankfurt Station and began to categorize artists such as New Order, Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk, Heaven 17 and Front 242 under the heading \"techno\", to sum up all technologically created dance music. In 1984 Talla started an event called on Sunday afternoons at Frankfurts Disco No name, which then moved to the Dorian Gray club in 1987. Talla's club spot served as the hub for the regional EBM and electronic music scene, and according to , of magazine, it had historical merit in being the first club in Germany to play almost exclusively electronic dance music. Technoclub was \"more or less an underground thing for suburban kids,\" it was, according to Laarmann, \"never really hip to go there.\"\n\nAt some point tension over \"who defines techno\" arose between scenes in Frankfurt and Berlin. DJ Tanith has expressed that Techno as a term already existed in Germany but was to a large extent undefined. has stated that the Frankfurt definition of techno associated with Talla's Technoclub differed from that used in Berlin. Frankfurt's Armin Johnert viewed techno as having its roots in acts such DAF, Cabaret Voltaire, and Suicide, but a younger generation of club goers had a perception of the older EBM and Industrial as handed down and outdated. The Berlin scene offered an alternative and many began embracing an imported sound that was being referred to as \"Techno-House.\" The move away from EBM had started in Berlin when acid house became popular, thanks to Monika Dietl's radio show on . Tanith distinguished acid-based dance music from the earlier approaches, whether it be DAF or Nitzer Ebb, because the latter was aggressive, he felt that it epitomised \"being against something,\" but of acid house he said, \"it's electronic, it's fun it's nice.\" By Spring 1990, Tanith, along with , an East-Berlin party organizer responsible for the X-tasy Dance Project, were organizing the first large scale rave events in Germany. This development would lead to a permanent move away from the sound associated with Techno-House and toward a hard edged mix of music that came to define Tanith and Wolle's parties. According to Wolle it was an \"out and out rejection of disco values,\" instead they created a \"sound storm\" and encouraged a form of \"dance floor socialism,\" where the DJ was not placed in the middle and you \"lose yourself in light and sound.\"\n\nIn 1993, the German techno label Tresor Records released the compilation album \"Tresor II: Berlin & Detroit – A Techno Alliance\", a testament to the influence of the Detroit sound upon the German techno scene and a celebration of a \"mutual admiration pact\" between the two cities. As the mid-1990s approached, Berlin was becoming a haven for Detroit producers; Jeff Mills and Blake Baxter even resided there for a time. In the same period, with the assistance of Tresor, Underground Resistance released their X-101/X-102/X103 album series, Juan Atkins collaborated with 3MB's Thomas Fehlmann and Moritz Von Oswald and Tresor-affiliated label Basic Channel had its releases mastered by Detroit's National Sound Corporation, the main mastering house for the entire Detroit dance music scene. In a sense, popular electronic music had come full circle, returning to Germany, home of a primary influence on the electronic dance music of the 1980s: Düsseldorf's Kraftwerk. Even the dance sounds of Chicago also had a German connection, as it was in Munich that Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte first produced the 1970s Eurodisco synthpop sound.\n\nAs techno continued to transmute a number of Detroit producers began to question the trajectory the music was taking. One response came in the form of so-called minimal techno (a term producer Daniel Bell found difficult to accept, finding the term \"minimalism\", in the artistic sense of the word, too \"arty\"). It is thought that Robert Hood, a Detroit-based producer and one time member of UR, is largely responsible for ushering in the minimal strain of techno. Hood describes the situation in the early 1990s as one where techno had become too \"ravey\", with increasing tempos, the emergence of gabber, and related trends straying far from the social commentary and soul-infused sound of original Detroit techno. In response, Hood and others sought to emphasize a single element of the Detroit aesthetic, interpreting techno with \"a basic stripped down, raw sound. Just drums, basslines and funky grooves and only what's essential. Only what is essential to make people move\". Hood explains:\n\nSome techno has also been influenced by or directly infused with elements of jazz. This led to increased sophistication in the use of both rhythm and harmony in a number of techno productions. Manchester (UK)-based techno act 808 State helped fuel this development with tracks such as \"Pacific State\" and \"Cobra Bora\" in 1989. Detroit producer Mike Banks was heavily influenced by jazz, as demonstrated on the influential Underground Resistance release \"Nation 2 Nation\" (1991). By 1993, Detroit acts such as Model 500 and UR had made explicit references to the genre, with the tracks \"Jazz Is The Teacher\" (1993) and \"Hi-Tech Jazz\" (1993), the latter being part of a larger body of work and group called Galaxy 2 Galaxy, a self-described jazz project based on Kraftwerk's \"man machine\" doctrine. This lead was followed by a number of techno producers in the UK who were influenced by both jazz and UR, Dave Angel's \"Seas of Tranquility\" EP (1994) being a case in point, Other notable artists who set about expanding upon the structure of \"classic techno\" include Dan Curtin, Morgan Geist, Titonton Duvante and Ian O'Brien.\n\nIn 1991 UK music journalist Matthew Collin wrote that \"Europe may have the scene and the energy, but it's America which supplies the ideological direction...if Belgian techno gives us riffs, German techno the noise, British techno the breakbeats, then Detroit supplies the sheer cerebral depth.\" By 1992 a number of European producers and labels began to associate rave culture with the corruption and commercialization of the original techno ideal. Following this the notion of an \"intelligent\" or Detroit inspired \"pure techno\" aesthetic began to take hold. Detroit techno had maintained its integrity throughout the rave era and was pushing a new generation of so-called \"intelligent techno\" producers forward. Simon Reynolds suggests that this progression \"involved a full-scale retreat from the most radically posthuman and hedonistically functional aspects of rave music toward more traditional ideas about creativity, namely the auteur theory of the solitary genius who humanizes technology.\"\n\nThe term \"intelligent techno\" was used to differentiate more sophisticated versions of underground techno from rave-oriented styles such as breakbeat hardcore, Schranz, Dutch Gabber. Warp Records was among the first to capitalize upon this development with the release of the compilation album \"Artificial Intelligence\" Of this time, Warp founder and managing director Steve Beckett said \n\nWarp had originally marketed \"Artificial Intelligence\" using the description \"electronic listening music\" but this was quickly replaced by \"intelligent techno\". In the same period (1992–93) other names were also bandied about such as armchair techno, ambient techno, and electronica, but all were used to describe an emerging form of \"post-rave\" dance music for the \"sedentary and stay at home\". Following the commercial success of the compilation in the United States, Intelligent Dance Music eventually became the phrase most commonly used to describe much of the experimental dance music emerging during the mid-to-late 1990s.\n\nAlthough it is primarily Warp that has been credited with ushering the commercial growth of IDM and electronica, in the early 1990s there were many notable labels associated with the initial \"intelligence\" trend that received little, if any, wider attention. Amongst others they include: Black Dog Productions (1989), Carl Craig's Planet E (1991), Kirk Degiorgio's Applied Rhythmic Technology (1991), Eevo Lute Muzique (1991), General Production Recordings (1991), New Electronica (1993), Mille Plateaux (1993), 100% Pure (1993), and Ferox Records (1993).\n\nIn the early 1990s a post-rave, DIY, free party scene had established itself in the UK. It was largely based around an alliance between warehouse party goers from various urban squat scenes and politically inspired new age travellers. The new agers offered a readymade network of countryside festivals that were hastily adopted by squatters and ravers alike. Prominent among the sound systems operating at this time were Exodus in Luton, Tonka in Brighton, Smokescreen in Sheffield, DiY in Nottingham, Bedlam, Circus Warp, LSDiesel and London's Spiral Tribe. The high point of this free party period came in May 1992 when with less than 24 hours notice and little publicity more than 35,000 gathered at the Castlemorton Common Festival for 5 days of partying.\n\nThis one event was largely responsible for the introduction in 1994 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act; effectively leaving the British free party scene for dead. Following this many of the traveller artists moved away from Britain to Europe, the US, Goa in India, Koh Phangan in Thailand and Australia's East Coast. In the rest of Europe, due in some part to the inspiration of traveling sound systems from the UK, rave enjoyed a prolonged existence as it continued to expand across the continent.\n\nSpiral Tribe, Bedlam and other English sound systems took their cooperative techno ideas to Europe, particularly Eastern Europe where it was cheaper to live, and audiences were quick to appropriate the free party ideology. It was European Teknival free parties, such as the annual Czechtek event in the Czech Republic that gave rise to several French, German and Dutch sound systems. Many of these groups found audiences easily and were often centered around squats in cities such as Amsterdam and Berlin.\n\nBy 1994 there were a number of techno producers in the UK and Europe building on the Detroit sound, but a number of other underground dance music styles were by then vying for attention. Some drew upon the Detroit techno aesthetic, while others fused components of preceding dance music forms. This led to the appearance (in the UK initially) of inventive new music that sounded far-removed from techno. For instance jungle (drum and bass) demonstrated influences ranging from hip-hop, soul, and reggae to techno and house.\n\nWith an increasing diversification (and commercialization) of dance music, the collectivist sentiment prominent in the early rave scene diminished, each new faction having its own particular attitude and vision of how dance music (or in certain cases, non-dance music) should evolve. Some examples not already mentioned are trance, industrial techno, breakbeat hardcore, acid techno, and happy hardcore. Less well-known styles related to techno or its subgenres include the primarily Sheffield (UK)-based bleep techno, a regional variant that had some success between 1989 and 1991. \n\nAccording to Muzik magazine, by 1995 the UK techno scene was in decline and dedicated club nights were dwindling. The music had become \"too hard, too fast, too male, too drug-oriented, too anally retentive.\" Despite this, weekly night at clubs such as Final Frontier (London), House of God (Birmingham), Pure (Edinburgh, whose resident DJ Twitch later founded the more eclectic Optimo), and Bugged Out (Manchester) were still popular. With techno reaching a state of \"creative palsy,\" and with a disproportionate number of underground dance music enthusiasts more interested in the sounds of rave and jungle, in 1995 the future of the UK techno scene looked uncertain as the market for \"pure techno\" waned. Muzik described the sound of UK techno at this time as \"dutiful grovelling at the altar of American techno with a total unwillingness to compromise.\" \n\nBy the end of the 1990s, a number of post-techno underground styles had emerged, including ghettotech (a style that combines some of the aesthetics of techno with hip-hop and house music), nortec, glitch, digital hardcore, the so-called \"no-beat techno\", and electroclash.\n\nIn attempting to sum up the changes since the heyday of Detroit techno, Derrick May has since revised his famous quote in stating that \"Kraftwerk got off on the third floor and now George Clinton's got Napalm Death in there with him. The elevator's stalled between the pharmacy and the athletic wear store.\"\n\nWhile techno and its derivatives only occasionally produce commercially successful mainstream acts—Underworld and Orbital being two better-known examples—the genre has significantly affected many other areas of music. In an effort to appear relevant, many established artists, for example Madonna and U2, have dabbled with dance music, yet such endeavors have rarely evidenced a genuine understanding or appreciation of techno's origins with the former proclaiming in January 1996 that \"Techno=Death\".\n\nThe R&B artist, Missy Elliott, exposed the popular music audience to the Detroit techno sound when she featured material from Cybotron's \"Clear\" on her 2006 release \"Lose Control\"; this resulted in Juan Atkins' receiving a Grammy Award nomination for his writing credit. Elliott's 2001 album \"Miss E... So Addictive\" also clearly demonstrated the influence of techno inspired club culture.\n\nIn recent years, the publication of relatively accurate histories by authors Simon Reynolds (\"Generation Ecstasy\", also known as \"Energy Flash\") and Dan Sicko (\"Techno Rebels\"), plus mainstream press coverage of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, have helped to diffuse the genre's more dubious mythology. Even the Detroit-based company Ford Motors eventually became savvy to the mass appeal of techno, noting that \"this music was created partly by the pounding clangor of the Motor City's auto factories. It became natural for us to incorporate Detroit techno into our commercials after we discovered that young people are embracing techno.\" With a marketing campaign targeting under-35s, Ford used \"Detroit Techno\" as a print ad slogan and chose Model 500's \"No UFO's\" to underpin its November 2000 MTV television advertisement for the Ford Focus.\n\nThe popularity of Euro disco and Italo disco—referred to as \"progressive\" in Detroit—and new romantic synthpop in the Detroit high school party scene from which techno emerged has prompted a number of commentators to try to redefine the origins of techno by incorporating musical precursors to the Detroit sound as part of a wider historical survey of the genre's development. The search for a mythical \"first techno record\" leads such commentators to consider music from long before the 1988 naming of the genre. Aside from the artists whose music was popular in the Detroit high school scene (\"progressive\" disco acts such as Giorgio Moroder, Alexander Robotnick, and Claudio Simonetti and synthpop artists such as Visage, New Order, Depeche Mode, The Human League, and Heaven 17), they point to examples such as \"Sharevari\" (1981) by A Number of Names, danceable selections from Kraftwerk (1977–83), the earliest compositions by Cybotron (1981), Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder's \"I Feel Love\" (1977), Moroder's \"From Here to Eternity\" (1977), and Manuel Göttsching's \"proto-techno masterpiece\" \"E2-E4\" (1981). Another example is a record entitled \"Love in C minor\", released in 1976 by Parisian Euro disco producer Jean-Marc Cerrone; cited as the first so called \"conceptual disco\" production and the record from which house, techno, and other underground dance music styles flowed. Yet another example is Yellow Magic Orchestra's work which has been described as \"proto-techno\" YMO had also used the prefix \"techno\" in a number of titles including the song \"Technopolis\" (1979), the album \"Technodelic\" (1981), and a rare flexi disc EP, \"The Spirit of Techno\" (1983).\n\nCertain electro-disco and European synthpop productions share with techno a dependence on machine-generated dance rhythms, but such comparisons are not without contention. Efforts to regress further into the past, in search of earlier antecedents, entails a further regression, to the sequenced electronic music of Raymond Scott, whose \"The Rhythm Modulator,\" \"The Bass-Line Generator,\" and \"IBM Probe\" are considered early examples of techno-like music. In a review of Scott's Manhattan Research Inc. compilation album the English newspaper The Independent suggested that \"Scott's importance lies mainly in his realization of the rhythmic possibilities of electronic music, which laid the foundation for all electro-pop from disco to techno.\" In 2008, a tape from the mid-to-late 1960s by the original composer of the Doctor Who theme Delia Derbyshire, was found to contain music that sounded remarkably like contemporary electronic dance music. Commenting on the tape, Paul Hartnoll, of the dance group Orbital, described the example as \"quite amazing,\" noting that it sounded not unlike something that \"could be coming out next week on Warp Records.\"\n\nIn general, techno is very DJ-friendly, being mainly instrumental (commercial varieties being an exception) and is produced with the intention of its being heard in the context of a continuous DJ set, wherein the DJ progresses from one record to the next via a synchronized segue or \"mix.\" Much of the instrumentation in techno emphasizes the role of rhythm over other musical parameters, but the design of synthetic timbres, and the creative use of music production technology in general, are important aspects of the overall aesthetic practice.\n\nUnlike other forms of electronic dance music that tend to be produced with synthesizer keyboards, techno does not always strictly adhere to the harmonic practice of Western music and such strictures are often ignored in favor of timbral manipulation alone. Thus techno inherits from the modernist tradition of the so-called Klangfarbenmelodie, or timbral serialism. The use of motivic development (though relatively limited) and the employment of conventional musical frameworks is more widely found in commercial techno styles, for example euro-trance, where the template is often an AABA song structure.\n\nThe main drum part is almost universally in common time (4/4); meaning 4 quarter note pulses per bar. In its simplest form, time is marked with kicks (bass drum beats) on each quarter-note pulse, a snare or clap on the second and fourth pulse of the bar, with an open hi-hat sound every second eighth note. This is essentially a disco (or even polka) drum pattern and is common throughout house and trance music as well. The tempo tends to vary between approximately 120 bpm (quarter note equals 120 pulses per minute) and 150 bpm, depending on the style of techno.\n\nSome of the drum programming employed in the original Detroit-based techno made use of syncopation and polyrhythm, yet in many cases the basic disco-type pattern was used as a foundation, with polyrhythmic elaborations added using other drum machine voices. This syncopated-feel (funkiness) distinguishes the Detroit strain of techno from other variants. It is a feature that many DJs and producers still use to differentiate their music from commercial forms of techno, the majority of which tend to be devoid of syncopation. Derrick May has summed up the sound as 'Hi-tech Tribalism': something \"very spiritual, very bass oriented, and very drum oriented, very percussive. The original techno music was very hi-tech with a very percussive feel... it was extremely, extremely Tribal. It feels like you're in some sort of hi-tech village.\"\n\nThere are many ways to create techno, but the majority will depend upon the use of loop-based step sequencing as a compositional method. Techno musicians, or \"producers\", rather than employing traditional compositional techniques, may work in an improvisatory fashion, often treating the electronic music studio as one large instrument. The collection of devices found in a typical studio will include units that are capable of producing many different sounds and effects. Studio production equipment is generally synchronized using a hardware- or computer-based MIDI sequencer, enabling the producer to combine in one arrangement the sequenced output of many devices. A typical approach to using this type of technology compositionally is to overdub successive layers of material while continuously looping a single measure or sequence of measures. This process will usually continue until a suitable multi-track arrangement has been produced.\n\nOnce a single loop-based arrangement has been generated, a producer may then focus on developing how the summing of the overdubbed parts will unfold in time, and what the final structure of the piece will be. Some producers achieve this by adding or removing layers of material at appropriate points in the mix. Quite often, this is achieved by physically manipulating a mixer, sequencer, effects, dynamic processing, equalization, and filtering while recording to a multi-track device. Other producers achieve similar results by using the automation features of computer-based digital audio workstations. Techno can consist of little more than cleverly programmed rhythmic sequences and looped motifs combined with signal processing of one variety or another, frequency filtering being a commonly used process. A more idiosyncratic approach to production is evident in the music of artists such as Twerk and Autechre, where aspects of algorithmic composition are employed in the generation of material.\n\nInstruments used by the original techno producers based in Detroit, many of which are now highly sought after on the retro music technology market, include classic drum machines like the Roland TR-808 and TR-909, devices such as the Roland TB-303 bass line generator, and synthesizers such as the Roland SH-101, Kawai KC10, Yamaha DX7, and Yamaha DX100 (as heard on Derrick May's seminal 1987 techno release \"Nude Photo\"). Much of the early music sequencing was executed via MIDI (but neither the TR-808 nor the TB-303 had MIDI, only DIN sync) using hardware sequencers such as the Korg SQD1 and Roland MC-50, and the limited amount of sampling that was featured in this early style was accomplished using an Akai S900.\n\nThe TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines have since achieved legendary status, a fact that is now reflected in the prices sought for used devices. During the 1980s, the 808 became the staple beat machine in Hip hop production while the 909 found its home in House music and techno. It was \"the pioneers of Detroit techno [who] were making the 909 the rhythmic basis of their sound, and setting the stage for the rise of Roland's vintage Rhythm Composer.\" In November 1995 the UK music technology magazine \"Sound on Sound\" noted: \n\nBy May 1996, \"Sound on Sound\" was reporting that the popularity of the 808 had started to decline, with the rarer TR-909 taking its place as \"the dance floor drum machine to use.\" This is thought to have arisen for a number of reasons: the 909 gives more control over the drum sounds, has better programming and includes MIDI as standard. \"Sound on Sound\" reported that the 909 was selling for between £900 and £1100 and noted that the 808 was still collectible, but maximum prices had peaked at about £700 to £800. Such prices have held in the 12 years since the article was published, this can be evidenced by a quick search on eBay. Despite this fascination with retro music technology, according to Derrick May \"there is no recipe, there is no keyboard or drum machine which makes the best techno, or whatever you want to call it. There never has been. It was down to the preferences of a few guys. The 808 was our preference. We were using Yamaha drum machines, different percussion machines, whatever.\"\n\nIn the latter half of the 1990s the demand for vintage drum machines and synthesizers motivated a number of software companies to produce computer-based emulators. One of the most notable was the \"ReBirth RB-338\", produced by the Swedish company Propellerhead and originally released in May 1997. Version one of the software featured two TB-303s and a TR-808 only, but the release of version two saw the inclusion of a TR-909. A \"Sound on Sound\" review of the RB-338 V2 in November 1998 noted that Rebirth had been called \"the ultimate techno software package\" and mentions that it was \"a considerable software success story of 1997\". In America \"Keyboard Magazine\" asserted that ReBirth had \"opened up a whole new paradigm: modeled analog synthesizer tones, percussion synthesis, pattern-based sequencing, all integrated in one piece of software\". Despite the success of ReBirth RB-338, it was officially taken out of production in September 2005. Propellerhead then made it freely available for download from a website called the \"ReBirth Museum\". The site also features extensive information about the software's history and development.\n\nIn March 2001, with the release of Reason V1, Propellerhead upped the ante in providing a £300 software-based electronic music studio, comprising a 14-input automated digital mixer, 99-note polyphonic 'analogue' synth, classic Roland-style drum machine, sample-playback unit, analogue-style step sequencer, loop player, multitrack sequencer, eight effects processors, and over 500 MB of synthesizer patches and samples. With this release Propellerhead were credited with \"creating a buzz that only happens when a product has really tapped into the zeitgeist, and may just be the one that many [were] waiting for.\" Reason has since achieved popular appeal and is as of 2018 at version 10.\n\nAs computer technology became more accessible and music software advanced, interacting with music production technology was possible using means that bore little relationship to traditional musical performance practices: for instance, laptop performance (\"laptronica\") and live coding.\nBy the mid 2000s a number of software-based virtual studio environments had emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's Reason and Ableton Live finding popular appeal. These software-based music production tools offer viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical hardware-based production studios, and thanks to advances in microprocessor technology, can create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. Such advances democratized music creation, and lead to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced music available to the general public via the internet. Artists can now also individuate their sound by creating personalized software synthesizers, effects modules, and various composition environments. Devices that once existed exclusively in the hardware domain can easily have virtual counterparts. Some of the more popular software tools for achieving such ends are commercial releases such as Max/Msp and Reaktor and freeware packages such as Pure Data, SuperCollider, and ChucK. In some sense, as a result of technological innovation, the DIY mentality that was once a core part of dance music culture is seeing a resurgence.\n\n\n\n\nBerghain night club in Berlin, famed for its no-holds-barred revelry and 24 hour opening policy, is considered by many to be the \"world capital\" of techno. Other notable Berlin venues include Tresor and Watergate. In the United Kingdom Glasgow's Sub Club has been associated with techno since the early 1990s and clubs such as London's Fabric and Egg London have gained notoriety for supporting techno.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27948527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27948527", "title": "The Moonlit Road", "text": "The Moonlit Road\n\n\"The Moonlit Road\" is a gothic horror short story by American Civil War soldier, wit, and writer Ambrose Bierce. It first appeared in a 1907 issue of \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine, illustrated by Charles B. Falls. This story is presented in three parts and relates the tale of the murder of Julia Hetman from the perspective of her son, a man who may be her husband, and Julia herself, through a medium.\n\nThe first part is narrated by Joel Hetman, Jr. He is summoned home from college by his father, because his mother, Julia, has been found strangled. His father claims that he returned from a business trip and saw the figure of a man fleeing the home. Upon entering the house, he found his wife lying dead in her bedroom. Months later, the father and son are walking down a moonlit road when the father sees something and suddenly turns pale and disappeared into the night.\n\nIn the second part of the story is narrated by a man who describes himself as a wandering outcast, wracked by guilt. He recounts a dream in which he suspects his wife is being unfaithful and he returns from a business trip early to find a strange man leaving his house. When he finds his wife cowering in her room, he murders her in a fit of jealous rage. In another dream, his wife's ghost confronts him on a moonlit road at night and the strangulation marks are still visible on her neck.\n\nThe third and final section is the statement of the murder victim, Julia Hetman, delivered through a medium. She describes the night she was murdered. Alone in the house, she heard frightening noises and believed she was being hunted by some creature of the night. While she cowered in the corner of her room, a man entered and strangled her, but she never saw his face. Later, upon seeing that her husband and son were sad, she tried to communicate with them from the spirit world and offer them comfort. She was finally able to appear to them on the moonlit road, but only her husband could see her and he fled in fear.\n\nBierce harbored a fear of dying, and this frequently provided inspiration for his fiction. He experienced guilt due to his estrangement from his mother and he also divorced his wife after finding that she had been unfaithful. These traits may have inspired the fictional events in \"The Moonlit Road\".\n\nThe story may serve as an illustration of William James's thesis that \"it is not so much the truth of events that matters, but how they are perceived, and the difference that they make to the perceiver\". The murderer thought the ghost of his victim was aware of his culpability, for her eyes fixed on his \"with an infinite gravity which is not reproach, nor hate, nor menace, nor anything less terrible than recognition\". In an ironic twist, the ghost's testimony reveals she did not know who her murderer was and approached her husband \"in the loving hope that he would be able to see her, smiling and consciously beautiful\". But the murderer, plagued by guilt, noticed only the strangulation marks he had left on her throat.\n\nAs Jack Sullivan pointed out, Bierce's story \"achieves an almost mind-numbing complexity by emerging from three fragmented points of view\". The truth can be deduced only from the combination of three accounts, because \"each of the characters is missing some vital element of the picture\".\n\n\"The Moonlit Road\" has been cited as a template for \"In a Grove\", a short story by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa in which the murder of a Samurai is recounted by multiple witnesses and in the end, the victim gives deposition through a medium. Akira Kurosawa used this story as the basis for the plot of his famous film \"Rashōmon\".\n\nIn 2008, Bierce's short story was loosely adapted by Leor Baum as a 19-minute film titled \"The Moonlit Road\". In 2009, The Library of America selected this story for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of \"American Fantastic Tales\", edited by Peter Straub. \n"}

It tells the story of the narrator's struggle to overcome the psychological damage inflicted by his dysfunctional childhood in South Carolina. Streisand directed and produced the film in addition to starring in it. Conroy and Becky Johnston adapted the screenplay.\n\nThe film was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, but lost the award to \"The Silence of the Lambs\".\n\nTom Wingo, a teacher and football coach from South Carolina, is asked by his mother, Lila, to travel to New York City to help his twin sister's psychiatrist, Susan Lowenstein, after his sister Savannah's latest suicide attempt. Tom hates New York but reluctantly accepts, largely to take the opportunity to be alone and away from a life that does not satisfy him. During his initial meetings with Lowenstein, Tom is reluctant to disclose many details of their dysfunctional family's secrets. In flashbacks, Tom relates incidents from his childhood to Lowenstein in hopes of discovering how to save Savannah's life. The Wingo parents were an abusive father and a manipulative, status-hungry mother. The father was a shrimp boat operator and, despite being successful at that profession, spent all of his money on frivolous business pursuits, leaving the family in poverty.\n\nTom is also torn with his own problems but hides behind what he calls \"the Southern way\"; i.e. laughing about everything. For example, his wife Sallie is having an affair, and her lover wants to marry her. Tom and Lowenstein begin having feelings for each other. After Tom discovers that she is married to Herbert Woodruff, a famous concert violinist, Lowenstein introduces Tom to her son Bernard, who is being groomed to become a musician as well but who secretly wants to play football. Tom starts coaching Bernard along with attending sessions with Lowenstein to help his sister. Tom discovers that Savannah has been in such a dissociated state that she even had a different identity, Renata Halpern. As Halpern, she wrote books to disguise the Savannah side of her troubled life. Tom confronts Lowenstein over not revealing this information before, and they argue, during which she throws a dictionary at him. To apologize, she asks him to dinner, and their relationship becomes closer.\n\nTom has a fateful meeting with his mother and stepfather, bringing up painful memories. Tom reveals that, when he was 13 years old, three escaped convicts invaded his home and raped him, his mother, and his sister. His older brother, Luke, killed two of the aggressors with a shotgun, while his mother stabbed the third with a kitchen knife. They buried the bodies beneath the house and never spoke of it again. Tom bursts into tears, having now let loose a key piece of Savannah's troubled life. \n\nAfter discovering that Tom has been coaching Bernard, Herbert orders Bernard to stop his football pursuits, return to his music lessons, to prepare to leave for Tanglewood, a prestigious music academy. Tom is invited to a dinner at Lowenstein's home, along with poets and intellectuals. Herbert is overtly rude and reveals that Tom's sister is in therapy with his wife. Infuriated, Lowenstein voices her suspicions about her husband's affair. Tom takes Herbert's \"million dollar\" violin and threatens to throw it off the high-rise balcony unless Herbert apologizes. Tom throws the violin in the air, Herbert nervously apologizes, and Tom catches the violin before it falls. \n\nTom spends a romantic weekend with Lowenstein at her country house. Savannah recovers and is released from the hospital. This recovery is due to finally learning about things she has repressed from her childhood, most notably the rapes. Her first suicide attempt at age 13 was after the rapes and murders of the three convicts. Tom then receives a call from his wife, who has finally decided she wants him back. He loves both Lowenstein and his wife, and tells Lowenstein he doesn't love his wife more, \"just longer\". Tom ends his relationship with Lowenstein and reunites with his wife and family, but wishes that two lives could be given to each man and woman. He is happy in his renewed life, after finally working out the traumatic events in his past with Lowenstein's help. Tom thinks of her daily as he reaches the top of the bridge on his drive home from work. Her name comes to him as a kind of prayer, a blessing.\n\n\nPat Conroy, author of the novel \"The Prince of Tides\", gave Streisand a copy of his novel with the inscription: \"To Barbra Streisand: The Queen of Tides...you are many things, Barbra, but you're also a great teacher...one of the greatest to come into my life. I honor the great teachers and they live in my work and they dance invisibly in the margins of my prose. You've honored me by taking care of it with such great seriousness and love. Great thanks, and I'll never forget that you gave 'The Prince of Tides' back to me as a gift. Pat Conroy.\"\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three and 1/2 stars out of four, praising Streisand's directing. Ebert wrote, \"By directing one good film, you prove that you had a movie inside of you. By directing two, you prove you are a real director\". He called the film \"an assured and very serious love story that allows neither humor nor romance to get in the way of its deeper and darker subject\", adding that \"Streisand shows herself as a director who likes emotional stories - but doesn't simplify them, and pays attention to the human quirks and strangeness of her characters\".\n\n\"Variety\" wrote: \"A deeply moving exploration of the tangled emotions of a dysfunctional Southern family, this lovingly crafted (though unevenly scripted) film of Pat Conroy’s novel centers on Nick Nolte’s performance of a lifetime. Bringing her usual strengths of character to her role as Nolte’s psychiatrist/lover, Barbra Streisand marks every frame with the intensity and care of a filmmaker committed to heartfelt, unashamed emotional involvement with her characters\".\n\nJonathan Rosenbaum of the \"Chicago Reader\" wrote: \"The results may seem overripe and dated in spots, but (Streisand) coaxes a fine performance out of Nolte, and the other actors (herself included) acquit themselves honorably\".\n\nAs of July 2018, \"The Prince of Tides\" holds a rating of 68% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 31 reviews.\n\n\"The Prince of Tides\" was a critical and box office success, opening at number four with a grossing of $10,035,412 behind \"Hook\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", and \"Father of the Bride\", and remained in the top 10 for seven weeks. Eventually the final gross was $74,787,599. The film grossed $36,100,000 in rentals, giving it a final gross of $110 million. The film was among the top 20 highest-grossing movies of the year at the box office.\n\nAlthough the film, its cast, and its crew received many nominations for Academy Awards, Best Director was not among these, while Best Picture was. At the following year's Oscar ceremonies, host Billy Crystal sang, to the tune of \"Don't Rain on My Parade,\" \"did this film direct itself? \" The following year, when \"A Few Good Men\" joined \"Prince of Tides\" and the previous year's \"Awakenings\" in being nominated for the latter award, but not the former, Columbia Pictures president Mark Canton issued a statement, \"This is unfortunately the third year in a row that Columbia has had a film nominated for Best Picture that seemingly directed itself.\"\n\n\n\nWhile the film was a box office hit and raised Streisand's reputation as a director, its numerous changes from the original novel upset some Conroy purists. Conroy and Johnston eliminated most of the novel's flashback scenes. They describe Tom Wingo's relationship with his siblings in great detail. In the novel, these flashbacks form the main plot and take up more of the novel than the romance between Streisand's character, Dr. Lowenstein, and Tom Wingo. The removal of the flashbacks makes the relationship between Wingo and Lowenstein the central story in the film, whereas in the novel, it is not. \nAnother character in the novel - the second Wingo brother, Luke, who appears only in flashbacks onscreen - is vitally important to the novel, and his death is a major plot point. In fact, the title of the book derives from a poem written by Savannah about Luke and his struggle against the government after the seizure of Colleton. In the film, \"The Prince of Tides\" is the title of a book of poetry written by Savannah and dedicated to Tom. Luke only appears intermittently, and his death is only vaguely described.\n\nStreisand initially hired English composer John Barry to write a score for the film, but Barry eventually left due to creative differences. In a 7 March 1996 Cinemusic conference interview, Barry explained his exodus from the film, stating, \"I was asked by Barbra Streisand to do \"The Prince of Tides\" – I live in New York, she lives in Los Angeles – and I went and met with her, and she showed me some footage, and she said, 'Why aren't you moving to Los Angeles?' and I said, 'Absolutely not.' And she said, 'Well, I like to know what's going on' – Barbra's an extreme case, by the way – and I said, 'Even if I did move to Los Angeles, I have no desire to meet with you once I know what I'm going to do. I can't work with someone over my shoulder, absolutely no way.'\" Barry later retitled his theme for \"The Prince of Tides\" \"Moviola\" and it was released on his 1992 movie theme album of the same name. The theme also appeared in Barry's 1995 score for the 3D IMAX film \"Across the Sea of Time\", retitled \"Flight Over New York\".\n\nThe final film score was composed by James Newton Howard and released 12 November 1991. It was well received by critics and garnered Howard his first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, though it lost to Alan Menken's music for \"Beauty and the Beast\". The soundtrack contains two songs by Streisand, although they did not appear in the film (one of those songs, \"Places That Belong To You\", was at one point intended for the film's end credits, but replaced with new music by Howard in the released version). The film also includes songs and music that do not appear on any soundtracks.\n\n\n \n"}

In computing the equivalent function can be performed using content-addressable memory.\n\nUnlike usual searches, which look for literal (i.e. exact, logical, or regular expression) matches, a transderivational search is a search for a possible meaning or possible match as part of communication, and without which an incoming communication cannot be made any sense of whatsoever. It is thus an integral part of processing language, and of attaching meaning to communication.\n\nA psychological example of TDS is in Ericksonian hypnotherapy, where vague suggestions are used that the patient must process intensely in order to find their own meanings, thus ensuring that the practitioner does not intrude his own beliefs into the subject's inner world.\n\nBecause TDS is a compelling, automatic and unconscious state of internal focus and processing (i.e. a type of everyday trance state), and often a state of internal lack of certainty, or openness to finding an answer (since something is being checked out at that moment), it can be utilized or interrupted, in order to create, or deepen, trance.\n\nTDS is a fundamental part of human language and cognitive processing. Arguably, every word or utterance a person hears, for example, and everything they see or feel and take note of, results in a very brief trance while TDS is carried out to establish a contextual meaning for it.\n\nLeading statements:\n\n\nTextual ambiguity:\n\nAlthough TDS is often associated with spoken language, it can be induced in any perceptual system. Thus Milton Erickson's \"hypnotic handshake\" is a technique that leaves the other person performing TDS in search of meaning to a deliberately ambiguous use of touch.\n\n"}
{"id": "40898752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40898752", "title": "Turkish mafia", "text": "Turkish mafia\n\nTurkish mafia () is the general term for criminal organizations based in Turkey and/or composed of (former) Turkish citizens. Crime groups with origins in Turkey are active throughout Western Europe (where a strong Turkish immigrant community exists) and the Middle East. Turkish criminal groups participate in a wide range of criminal activities, internationally the most important being drug trafficking, especially heroin. In the trafficking of heroin they cooperate with Bulgarian mafia groups who transport the heroin further to countries such as Italy.\nCriminal activities such as the trafficking of other types of drugs, illegal gambling, human trafficking, prostitution or extortion are committed in Turkey itself as well as European countries with a sizeable Turkish community such as Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom.\n\nTurkish gangs and mafias also cooperate with some Laz, Zaza and Kurdish gangs. Some Turkish gangs accept non-Turkish members. Some Turkish crime syndicates have their origin in two regions: the Trabzon province on the Black Sea coast of northeastern Turkey and the East and Southeast Anatolia in the south of the country.\n\nThe Turkish Mafia was involved in the weapons trade in the 2010s, and the heroin trade in the 2010s to present, and then moved along into human smuggling.\n\nBekir Celenk was one of the godfathers of the Turkish mafia and was involved in the plot to assassinate pope John Paul II.\n\nCriminal groups composed of Turks are active throughout the country and in communities with a large ethnically Turkish population. Certain Turkish criminal groups have strong links with corrupt politicians and corrupt members of the local law enforcement. They are active in different sections of organized crime and can often be linked to politically motivated groups, such as the Grey Wolves. This can especially be the case with criminals in immigrant Turkish communities. Powerful and important Turkish criminal organizations mostly have their origin in the Trabzon Province and incorporate members of both the Turkish and the Laz populations.\n\nEven though crime groups composed of Turks come from all over the country, a relatively high amount of them have origins in the Black Sea region of Turkey. These groups consisting of Laz people and Turks are especially strong in the country itself. Black Sea crime bosses such as Alaattin Çakıcı are known from having links to or being members of the politically motivated group Grey Wolves.\n\nFollowing the substantial immigration of Turkish Cypriots to London criminal gangs composed of Turkish Cypriots were formed in working-class neighborhoods. Mainly involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery, money laundering these crime clans have more in common with the traditional White British crime firms than with the Turkish mafia.\n\nSome ethnically Kurdish crime groups have their origin in the Southeast Anatolia part of Turkey. These groups are believed largely clan based and their main source of income is allegedly believed to be the trafficking of heroin and weapons. Some group of those leaders, such as Hüseyin Baybaşin had been active in Western European countries, especially Great Britain. Some Turkish sources have accused them to have links to the PKK, but never confirmed by authorities.\n\nWhile ethnically Zaza groups are not noteworthy in Turkey itself, large Alevi Zaza immigrant communities have formed in Great Britain and Germany. Criminal gangs from these communities have links with other Turkish and Kurdish crime bosses and are involved in drug trafficking and contract killing. An example in London is the brutal turf war between Turkish gangs, such as the so-called \"Tottenham Boys\" and the \"Hackney Turks\". The Tottenham Boys and Hackney are mainly Turkish gangs, but they have also some Kurdish members.\n\n"}
