Historically, dislike or hatred toward the Netherlands. The Dutch people and their culture has arisen from the colonization undertaken by the Netherlands, and from the roles it has played in European wars. This sentiment is reflected in various expressions that have entered the English language.\n\nMost of present-day Indonesia was a Dutch colony – the Dutch East Indies – from 1800 until the Japanese invasion during World War II. After the defeat of the Japanese, when the Dutch attempted to reassert control, anti-Dutch feeling developed among the native population, encompassing anything associated with the Dutch. The outcome was the Indonesian National Revolution, culminating in 1949 in the independence of Indonesia.\n\nIn South Africa, following the Boer War (1899-1902) between the British government and settlers of Dutch descent, anti-Dutch sentiments were present within the English-speaking population and were identified with the Unionist Party.\n\nA growing nationalist movement gave rise to anti-Dutch sentiment during the 1950s in the then colony of Surinam. Suriname became self-governing in 1954 and fully independent in 1975.\n\nFrom the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th to 19th centuries date expressions conveying varying degrees of hostility or mockery towards the Dutch, such as \"Dutch courage\", \"Dutch uncle\", \"Going Dutch\", \"Dutch treat\", \"Double Dutch\" and \"I'm a Dutchman\". Anti-Dutch feeling grew up in England during the three wars against the Dutch Republic between 1652 and 1674, and continued during and after the reign of William of Orange.\n\nThe neutrality maintained by the Netherlands during the First World War evoked unfavourable comment in Britain, epitomised by a remark in \"Punch\": \n\nDuring World War II, German occupiers in Belgium were promoting the use of Dutch language in communities of French-speakers, which lead to strong Dutchphobia among those people.\n"}

Created by the architecte Frédéric Keiff in 2007, it looks like a palaver tree, whose trunk and branches are made of painted iron rods, while attached fragments of colored glass represent leaves.\n\nThe Arbre à Palabre by Frédéric Keiff is a palaver tree whose trunk and branches are made of painted iron rods, while attached fragments of colored glass represent leaves. The installation is more than 5 meters tall with a canopy circumference of 7 meters, and it is equipped with wooden slabs embedded in the trunk, serving as benches. It is a passageway installation.\n\nInitially conceived to substitute the former palaver tree of Douala, a huge baobab located in the district of Bonaberi, which fell down in 1993, the symbolic meaning of the installation forced some changes in the process. Traditionally, around the palaver tree, the chief of the village and the council members (the so-called notables) meet and seat in order to take the most important political and social decisions concerning the community, and it is there that tradition values were orally transmitted through generations.\n\nThis artwork became the subject of a long discussion between the chief of the village and the notables, who finally decided to forbid a foreign artist to place his artwork next to the rest of the former palaver tree. However, it was important that Keiff’s installation was positioned in a public space, easily accessible to inhabitants in order to guarantee that the contemporary palaver tree would keep on holding its symbolic function as a meeting, discussion, and sharing point. The superior chief of Douala, the Prince René Duala Manga Bell, offered one of his properties in Bonanjo for repositioning the Arbre à Palabre that was inaugurated for and officially donated to the city of Douala.\n\nThe park where the Arbre à Palabre is located belongs to the Bell family, even if the installation itself is in the public domain. This area is surrounded by three historical monuments of Douala: to the North, the Vault of kings Bell, where today the same René Douala Manga Bell lies; to the South, the Espace doual'art (funding agency of the project) from which one can clearly see the Palace of the Kings Bell, commonly known as “La Pagode”, built in 1905 by German colonizers for the king Auguste Manga Ndoumbe; and, finally, to the West, the Old law court building.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53476296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53476296", "title": "Ballochmyle cup and ring marks", "text": "Ballochmyle cup and ring marks\n\nThe Ballochmyle cup and ring marks were first recorded at Ballochmyle (NS 5107 2552), Mauchline, East Ayrshire, Scotland in 1986, very unusually carved on a vertical red sandstone cliff face, forming one of the most extensive areas of such carvings as yet found in Britain. They have been designated a scheduled ancient monument. \n\nThese carvings or petroglyphs were first recorded in 1986 (although a '1751' carved date suggests an earlier discovery) when the Kingencleugh Estate decided to clear an area of vegetation along the north side of the Liddell Burn that is a minor tributary stream of the River Ayr in an area famous for its quarrying of red sandstone. The removal of vegetation exposed the carvings that are distributed across two faces of a vertical outcrop of rock and they were reported to the Dick Institute in Kilmarnock. The presence of possible medieval carvings, the extensive quarrying with numerous workmen employed in the area, especially during the construction of the Ballochmyle Viaduct, emphasises how surprising it is that these glyphs were overlooked for so long, especially as they are only about 2 km south-east of Mauchline's town centre.\n\nThe rock here is described as being a \"pink dessert sandstone from the Permian age showing clear signs of dune bedding\". The cup and ring marks are composed of two 'panels' with several hundred 'cup and ring' and other glyphs or carvings in a range of styles, ranging from single shallow cups through to deeper cups with multiple rings. Less common, but unique in the Scottish context are ‘square with cup’ carvings; ‘ringed stars’ are also present. Three deer-like carvings and some other inscriptions with Lombardic style letters were also carved into the rockface and these are thought to be medieval in date.\n\nSeveral feet of soil were removed from the bottom of the corner that divides the two main halves of the site and this uncovered three 'trilithon-like' carvings and others may await discovery where the soil has not been removed. The carvings were protected by the vegetation and began to deteriorate after this was removed and in addition vandalism and theft of a panel has taken place. It is likely that they were historically hidden from direct view by trees and shrubs.\n\nThe Ballochmyle glyphs or motifs are carved on red sandstone, however they are found elsewhere on other sedimentary rocks such as Millstone Grits, as well as the harder igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granites and schists.\n\nThe basic 'cup' is the most common carving however a wide range of glyphs exist with single to multiple concentric circles that are sometimes cut through in various ways by channels, etc. Where concentric rings exist the central cup often appears to dominate in depth and size suggesting that they were subject to repeated reworking over a period of time. Some incomplete or poorly formed glyphs exist here suggesting that different persons were involved in making them and frequent overlays of existing glyphs with either 'cups' or 'cup rings' suggests that they were created over an extended period of time.\n\nStudies suggest that distinct stylistic groupings may be present with one panel area having simple cups and cups with grooves, whilst another area has predominately bold cups with multiple concentric rings. An area with an apparent Lombardic style lettering may read 'ASAID' with two or three unreadable leading letters and a likely lost section. The final element is a date '1751' that is considered authentic but did not lead to further recorded investigation.\n\nEvidence suggests that cup and ring art was created from the Neolithic through to the Bronze Age, that is approximately 4000 BC to 1500 BC.\n\nCup and ring mark stones are frequently found throughout Britain, with over 2500 sites in England alone, however an unusual feature of those at Ballochmyle is that they have been carved on nearly or actual vertical surfaces rather than horizontal and often 'altar-like' exposed stone outcrops. These types of carvings were created using 'hammerstones' or 'peckers', examples of these have been found elsewhere, hitting the surface of the rock repeatedly or using a grinding motion until the desired design was formed Some of the long grooves appear to be a series of cups that were then joined together. The soft nature of the stone at Ballochmyle gives insights into how the glyphs were created with many small holes that could not have been formed by a hammering action.\n\nThe contrast with the original rock surface and the effect of shadow and rain usually makes the markings stand out however hints of the use of coloured pigments have been found at other sites and such things as animal fat, charcoal, plants dyes, etc. could have been used during various types of ceremonies to enhance the glyphs or as part of their cultural use.\n\nThe frequency and widespread use of the same glyphs or motifs indicates that they had definite interpretive meanings and significance to the cultures that created them and these developed and then persisted over thousands of years. The locations indicate that these carvings were mostly for public display and not usually intended as part of secret practices where the fact that they were hidden was important.\n\nIt may be relevant that the Ballochmyle area has both spectacular geological formations and geographical features in addition to the presence of a significant liminal zone in the form of a major watercourse, the River Ayr. Carvings into rocks can have deeper meanings such as with the carved footprint Petrosomatoglyphs at Dunadd in Argyll, linking a person literally to the land. The concept of the Anima locus is pertinent here, that is the 'soul' of a place, its essential personality as perceived in the imagination and emotions of visitors. A concept linked to the belief in supernatural spirits of nature as residing in stones, springs, mountains, islands, trees, etc. A form of religious significance linked to life and death, past and present, real and spiritual worlds, etc. has been proposed.\n\nA significant factor is that, as previously stated, they were created from Neolithic through to the Bronze Age, that is approximately 4000 BC to 1500 BC and they ceased when the Celtic Culture began to dominate and suppress older cultural practices. During this time smaller nomadic groups that might visit certain sites seasonally developed into sedentary communities with hierarchical leadership structures and specific communal religious practices.\n\nMany 'galleries' of cup and ring mark art are in prominent places within the landscape, such as river gorges, waterfalls, outcrops, caves, etc. and it has been suggested that they may have defined territorial boundaries, either for a locality or for a significant land holding. Few prehistoric track ways have been positively identified however some link with the more practical aspects of Ley lines may be indicated by the observation that cup and ring art is sometimes found overlooking natural harbours, on prominent natural landscape features, in mountain passes, along valley sides, at the entrances to inland routes, etc.\n\nIt is thought that natural features of the rock faces may influence the cup and ring mark sizes, distribution and type in addition to 'framing' the carvings. Fissures, grooves, wind erosion marks, cracks, dune bedding, etc. may all have been regarded by the Cup and ring mark carvers as significant and meaningful in their own right to be copied, enhanced, removed or incorporated as possibly the work of their 'ancestors' or even the works of the gods themselves.\n\nSome cup and ring mark panels may have only been used seasonally and the varying level of complexity at sites has been interpreted as being both more and less significant in terms of the level of meaning present.\n\nThe universality of cup and ring markings suggest a commonality of the origins of such glyphs that may relate to natural phenomena that are deemed significant, such as the concentricles that form on water when an object or offering is placed in it and although this may have been interpreted differently by the many cultures involved, the liminality with associated themes of thresholds and communication with the 'other side' may be one explanation for the use of cup and rings rather than the extensive use of glyphs such as ovals, boxes, triangles, star-shapes, etc.\n\nIn 2015 AOC Archaeology group were employed by the Forestry Commission Scotland to carry out a survey of laser scanning and photogrammetry on the Ballochmyle cup and ring marks. Laser scanning recorded the glyphs in 3D in minute detail, taking millions of measurements. The Photogrammetry involved photographing the site from many different angles and then bringing the data together to create a 3D model. The RCAHMS carried out a survey on behalf of Historic Scotland in 1987 and a series of drawings were lodged with what is now Historic Environment Scotland.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44230322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44230322", "title": "Breton (hat)", "text": "Breton (hat)\n\nA Breton (or Bretonne) is a woman's hat with a round crown and a deep brim that is turned upwards all the way round, exposing the face. Sometimes the hat has a domed crown. Typically it is worn tilted to the back of the head.\n\nThe style first appeared under this name in the 19th century and was generally made of lightweight and malleable material such as straw or felt. It is said to derive from the straw hats traditionally worn by Breton agricultural workers. It is not to be confused with the Breton cap, a fabric cap with a peak at the front associated with fishermen.\nThe Breton had a revival of popularity in the 1960s, with high-profile wearers helping to make it fashionable. During this era it also appeared in more extreme styles, with oversized turned-back brims. After British model Jean Shrimpton caused a scandal at the Melbourne Cup Carnival in Australia in 1965 by attending Derby Day hatless, bare legged and in a short summer frock, she returned three days later to the Melbourne Cup in a sober tailored suit with a large ice-blue straw Breton hastily created by local milliner Adele Chapeaux of South Yarra. In 1968, a neat straw version was worn right on the back of the head by Mia Farrow in the horror film \"Rosemary's Baby\".\n\nSuch was the hat's popularity that \"The Times\" fashion editor Prudence Glynn singled it out in 1966 as part of the British 'uniform' at official summer events. In a feature warning of the perils of choosing an expensive occasion outfit in a country where the weather could not be relied upon, she said: \"Look at the photographs taken at the Derby. The weather couldn't have been more unpromising, yet there were the British ladies staunchly parading the British Special Occasion Outfit (Subsection: Race Meetings) – Sling back shoes, wind-torn Bretons clapped onto untidy damp hair, nodding and smiling away under tons of artificial pansies and draped tulle.\"\n\nAs well as coming in a variety of sizes, Bretons may feature additional details such as feathers, flowers and ribbon trims.\nIn 1955, Christian Dior introduced the wide-brimmed Breton – also known as the padre hat – for its resemblance to ecclesiastical headgear. Unlike the more traditional tipped back Breton, this model was worn flat on the head.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44778530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44778530", "title": "Chariot clock", "text": "Chariot clock\n\nA chariot clock is a type of mantel/table figural clock in the form of a chariot whose dial is set into the wheel or elsewhere, its origins date back to the second half of the 16th century southern Germany. Normally of classical mythology subject matter, it has been made in different periods and styles such as Renaissance, Louis XV, Louis XVI, Empire, Napoleon III, Art Deco, etc.\n\nIn the historical context of the Renaissance, the so-called chariot clocks born in South Germany, a centre for clockmaking in Europe that flourished between 1550-1650, the leading cities being Augsburg, Nuremberg and Munich. They were selfmoving wheeled tabletop clocks that included automata figurines and some a musical movement too. The German examples have not the dial inserted in the wheel, but in the seat or some other place.\n\nMost of them were fabricated in Augsburg, although several existing clocks cannot be located due to the lack of inscriptions or hallmarks and are therefore ascribed only to South German workshops. These rare and at those days very costly pieces were only afforded by the nobility and royal courts.\n\nIn the 18th century France, during the Louis XV and Louis XVI reigns a small number of models, following their respective styles, were made, but it was not until the late 1790s and particularly during the first quarter of the 19th century that this type of clock found true popularity. Its revival was largely inspired by Napoleon Bonaparte’s conquers and victories in battles, though it continued to be in vogue after his definitive fall in 1815, specifically until the mid 1820s.\n\nIts popularity in much of Europe gave rise to a wide diversity of models (and variations within each model), allowing the fullest opportunity for the sculptor and bronzier to express their creativity and the brilliance of their craft. The freedom of trade initiated by the French Revolution allowed many casters, who during the ancien régime worked in workshops strictly limited to making bronze, to develop large factories. They took advantage of this opportunity to execute all stages of bronze making within one factory and drew, cast, gilded, assembled and sold objects of their own workshops. Artisans still benefited from pre-Revolution training and worked according to the standards of a luxury art from the ancien régime, but they had better means of production and organization. Once freed from the technical constraints, the artists were able to give free rein to their imagination and their fantasy to create a multitude of models.\n\nThis coincided in time with the golden age of the decorative bronze using the ormolu technique, with a whole series of celebrated bronziers creating masterpieces of design, craftsmanship and good taste, one of the most famous being Pierre-Philippe Thomire. All followed the same basic design, featuring an ancient chariot (two or four wheeled) on top of a rectangular or oblong base made out of bronze or marble, carrying figures of classical mythology deities, with the majority of them having the dial set into the wheel.\n\nIn common with the rest of the French Empire style mantel clocks of the period, the allegorical \"pendules au char\" (chariot clocks) also had a meaning, served a political ideology and often exalted moral values: Heroism, bravery, military virtues, love and fidelity, study and encouragement of arts and sciences, etc. They also have an educational power with evocative themes and narrative scenes in relief at the base.\n\nApart from France, in the first quarter of the 19th century, although to a much lesser extent, Empire style chariot clocks were also fabricated in Austria, England and Italy.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century and early 20th, this type of clock was produced again in France, some were replicas/versions of Empire and Louis XVI style preexisting models, while others were new designs crafted in the style of the day, like Napoleon III, or inspired in styles of the past, such as Louis XV or Rococo.\n\nIn the United States, the New Haven clock company produced a model in the early 20th century.\n\nAmong the range of models of the French company Berlot-Mussier (they used the trade name ODYV between 1927-1940) there were one in the Art Deco style with the case made out of faience they sold in the 1930s.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "286387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286387", "title": "Culture of North Korea", "text": "Culture of North Korea\n\nThe contemporary culture of North Korea is based on traditional Korean culture, but developed since the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic in 1948.\n\n\"Juche\" ideology asserts Korea's cultural distinctiveness and creativity as well as the productive powers of the working masses.\n\nArt in North Korea is primarily didactic; cultural expression serves as an instrument for inculcating \"Juche\" ideology and the need to continue the struggle for revolution and reunification of the Korean Peninsula. Foreign governments and citizens, especially the Japanese and the Americans, are depicted negatively as imperialists; revolutionary heroes and heroines are seen as saintly figures who act from the purest of motives. The three most consistent themes are martyrdom during the revolutionary struggle (depicted in literature such as \"The Sea of Blood\"), the happiness of the present society, and the genius of the leader.\n\nKim Il-sung has been described as a writer of \"classical masterpieces\" during the anti-Japanese struggle. Novels created under his direction include \"The Flower Girl\", \"The Sea of Blood\", \"The Fate of a Self-Defense Corps Man\", and \"The Song of Korea\"; these are considered \"prototypes and models of \"Juche\" literature and art.\" A 1992 newspaper report describes Kim in semi-retirement as writing his memoirs—\"a heroic epic dedicated to the freedom and happiness of the people.\"\n\nThe population has little or no exposure to foreign cultural influences apart from performances by song-and-dance groups and other entertainers brought in periodically for limited audiences. These performances, such as the Spring Friendship Art Festival held annually in April, are designed to show that the peoples of the world, like the North Koreans themselves, love and respect the country's leader. During the 1980s and the early 1990s, the North Korean media gave Kim Jong-il credit for working ceaselessly to make the country a \"kingdom of art\" where a cultural renaissance unmatched in other countries was taking place. Indeed, the younger Kim was personally responsible for cultural policy.\n\nPyongyang and other large cities offer the broadest selection of cultural expression. \"Art Propaganda squads\" travel to production sites in the provinces to perform poetry readings, one-act plays, and songs in order to \"congratulate workers on their successes\" and \"inspire them to greater successes through their artistic agitation.\" Such squads are prominent in the countryside during the harvest season and whenever \"speed battles\" to increase productivity are held.\n\nNorth Korean society and culture through the lens of theater, film, and everyday performance [make up] an ideology-shaping matrix that not only entertains but also essentially organizes and mobilizes society. The socialist culture has had a tremendous influence on daliy life of people in North Korea.\n\nThe state and the Korean Workers' Party control the production of literature and art. In the early 1990s, there was no evidence of any underground anti-regime literary or cultural movements such as the samizdat in the Soviet Union or those that exist in the People's Republic of China. The party exercises control over culture through its Propaganda and Agitation Department and the Culture and Arts Department of the KWP's Central Committee. The KWP's General Federation of Korean Literature and Arts Unions, the parent body for all literary and artistic organizations, also directs cultural activity. Due to widespread media control, some analysts have characterized North Koreans as \"censorees\".\nThese media of paintings, songs, movies, and mass games not only tell the story of Kim Il-sung as the father of the nation, but also provide guidance on how to behave as \"model citizens\".\n\nA central theme of cultural expression is to take the best from the past and discard capitalist elements. Popular, vernacular styles and themes in literature, art, music, and dance are esteemed as expressing the truly unique spirit of the Korean nation. Ethnographers devote much energy to restoring and reintroducing cultural forms that have the proper proletarian or folk spirit and that encourage the development of a collective consciousness. Lively, optimistic musical and choreographic expression are stressed. Group folk dances and choral singing are traditionally practiced in some but not all parts of Korea and were being promoted throughout North Korea in the early 1990s among school and university students. Farmers' musical bands have also been revived.\n\nLiterature and music are other venues for expressing the country's ideology. Kim Jong-il shows interest or perhaps even obsession with cinema. The North Korean leader reportedly has a huge library of Western and Asian movies. In the 1980s, he even ordered the kidnapping of two South Korean movie-makers and forced them to make films for the North Korean state. A series of historical novels—\"Pulmyouui yoksa\" (\"Immortal History\")—depict the heroism and tragedy of the preliberation era. The Korean War is the theme of \"Korea Fights\" and \"The Burning Island\". Since the late 1970s, five \"great revolutionary plays\" have been promoted as prototypes of the party's literature: \"The Shrine for a Tutelary Deity\", a theatrical rendition of \"The Flower Girl\", \"Three Men, One Party\", \"A Letter from a Daughter\", and \"Hyolbun mangukhoe\" (\"Resentment at the World Conference\").\n\nKorean revolutionary opera, derived from traditional Korean operas, known as \"ch'angguk\", often utilize variations on Korean folk songs. Old fairy tales have also been transformed to include revolutionary themes. As part of the party's policy of preserving the best from Korea's past, moreover, premodern vernacular works such as the \"Sasong kibong\" (\"Encounter of Four Persons\") and the \"Ssangch'on kibong\" (\"Encounter at the Two Rivers\") have been reprinted.\n\nMusical compositions include the \"Song of General Kim Il Sung\", \"Long Life and Good Health to the Leader,\" and \"We Sing of His Benevolent Love\"—hymns that praise the nation's leader. According to a North Korean writer, \"Our musicians have pursued the party's policy of composing orchestral music based on famous songs and folk songs popular among our people and produced numerous instrumental pieces of a new type.\" This music includes a symphony based on the theme of \"The Sea of Blood\", which has also been made into a revolutionary opera.\n\nIn February 2008, The New York Philharmonic Orchestra became the first U.S. orchestra to perform in North Korea, albeit for a handpicked \"invited audience.\" The concert was broadcast on national television. The Christian rock band Casting Crowns played at the annual Spring Friendship Arts Festival in April 2007, held in Pyongyang.\n\nMotion pictures are recognized as \"the most powerful medium for educating the masses\" and play a central role in social education. According to a North Korean source, \"films for children contribute to the formation of the rising generation, with a view to creating a new kind of man, harmoniously evolved and equipped with well-founded knowledge and a sound mind in a sound body.\" One of the most influential films, \"An Jung-geun Shoots Ito Hirobumi\", tells of the assassin who killed the Japanese resident-general in Korea in 1909. An is depicted as a courageous patriot, but one whose efforts to liberate Korea were frustrated because the masses had not been united under \"an outstanding leader who enunciates a correct guiding thought and scientific strategy and tactics.\" Folk tales such as \"The Tale of Chun Hyang\", about a nobleman who marries a servant girl, and \"The Tale of On Dal\" have also been made into films.\n\nAustralian filmmaker Anna Broinowski gained access to North Korea's film industry through British filmmaker Nick Bonner, who facilitated meetings between Broinowski and prominent North Korean filmmakers to assist Broinowski with the production of \"Aim High in Creation!\", a film project based on Kim Jong-il's manifesto. Broinowski explained in July 2013, prior to the screening of the film at the Melbourne International Film Festival:\nA friend gave me Kim Jong Il's manifesto on how to make the 'perfect socialist film', The Cinema and Directing (1987). I was immediately fascinated by his often counter-intuitive (for a Westerner at least) filmmaking rules. And I began to wonder: what would a film by Westerners, strictly adhering to Kim Jong Il's rules, be like? Could it have the same power over western audiences that North Korean films have over Kim Jong Il's 23 million citizens? ... I wanted to humanise the North Koreans in the minds of viewers constantly bombarded by the mainstream Western media's depiction of North Koreans as victimised, brainwashed automatons.\n\nA version of Broinowski's work was screened in Pyongyang, but the director believes that the documentary version of the film will not be allowed into the country.\n\nA study commissioned by the U. S. State Department shows that, despite extremely strict regulations and draconian penalties, North Koreans, particularly elite elements, have increasing access to news and other media outside the state-controlled media authorized by the government. While access to the Internet is tightly controlled, listening to the radio and viewing DVDs is increasing, and receiving television broadcasts from neighboring states is also possible in border areas.\nA South Korean professor claimed that the spread of cheap, Chinese-made \"portable TVs\" (EVD players) in North Korea is making it harder for authorities to crack down on citizens watching South Korean-made videos.\nUriminzokkiri is a Korean news website that frequently posts propaganda including the United States attack video published in 2013.\n\nHistorically, graphic design in North Korea was influenced by the Soviet bloc and by Korean tradition. It has tended to use a \"Korean palette\" of bright colours. In around 2005, digital design replaced hand-drawn graphics, and the Western influence became stronger.\n\nThe most distinct and impressive form of contemporary cultural expression in North Korea is architecture and city planning. P'yongyang, almost completely destroyed by the United States during the Korean War, has been rebuilt on a grand scale. Many new buildings have been constructed during the 1980s and 1990s in order to enhance P'yongyang's status as a capital.\n\nMajor structures are divided architecturally into three categories: monuments, buildings that combine traditional Korean architectural motifs and modern construction, and high-rise buildings of a modern design. Examples of the first include the Ch'ollima Statue; a twenty-meter high bronze statue of Kim Il-sung in front of the Museum of the Korean Revolution (itself, at 240,000 square meters, one of the largest structures in the world); the Arch of Triumph (similar to its Parisian counterpart, although a full ten meters higher); and Chuch'e Tower, 170 meters high, built on the occasion of Kim's seventieth birthday in 1982.\n\nThe second architectural category makes special use of traditional tiled roof designs and includes the People's Culture Palace and the Grand People's Study House, both in P'yongyang, and the International Friendship Exhibition Hall at Myohyang-san. The latter building displays gifts given to Kim Il-sung by foreign dignitaries. In light of North Korea's current close relationship to China, and during the Choson Dynasty, it is significant that the section of the hall devoted to gifts from China is the largest.\n\nThe third architectural category includes high-rise apartment complexes and hotels in the capital. The most striking of these buildings is the Ryugyong Hotel, unfinished as of now (with construction halted from 1992 - April 2008). Described as one of the world's tallest hotel at 105 stories, its triangular shape looms over north-central P'yongyang. The Koryo Hotel is an ultramodern, twin-towered structure forty-five stories high.\n\nMuch construction occurred before celebrations of Kim Il-sung's eightieth birthday, including the building of grand apartment complexes and the Reunification Highway, a four-lane road connecting the capital and the Demilitarized Zone. According to a journalist writing in the \"Far Eastern Economic Review\", the highway is \"an impressive piece of engineering\" that \"cuts a straight path through mountainous terrain with 21 tunnels and 23 bridges on the 168 kilometers route to P'anmunjm.\" As in many other construction projects, the military provided the labor. North Korea has stated its hope that upon eventual reunification the highway will carry back-and-forth traffic.\n\nNorth Korea is famous for its \"mass games\". Mass games are the culminating annual celebrations of the state leader's birthdays and the rituals commemorating the foundation of the state: On the birthdays of Kim Il-sung (April 15, 1912), the founding father of North Korea, and Kim Jong-il (born February 16, 1942, the former leader of the state. These are exhibitions where thousands of North Koreans perform highly choreographed dances, especially traditional dances and gymnastics, often engaging in simultaneous rhythms of movement. The performers sing and chant their loyalties to Kim il-sung, the KWP, and to the principle of Juche.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12210793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12210793", "title": "Diversity (business)", "text": "Diversity (business)\n\nThe \"business case for diversity\" stems from the progression of the models of diversity within the workplace since the 1960s. The original model for diversity was situated around affirmative action drawing strength from the law and a need to comply with equal opportunity employment objectives. This compliance-based model gave rise to the idea that tokenism was the reason an individual was hired into a company when they differed from the dominant group.\n\nThe social justice model evolved next and extended the idea that individuals outside the dominant group should be given opportunities within the workplace, not only because it was instituted as a law, but because it was the right thing to do. Kevin Sullivan an ex-vice president of Apple Inc. said that \"diversity initiatives must be sold as business, not social work.\" This model still revolved around the idea of tokenism, but it also brought in the notion of hiring based on a \"good fit\".\n\nIn the deficit model, it is believed that organizations that do not have a strong diversity inclusion culture will invite lower productivity, higher absenteeism, and higher turnover which will result in higher costs to the company.\n\nIn a journal article entitled \"The multicultural organization\" by Taylor Cox, Jr., Cox talks about three organization types that focus on the development of cultural diversity. The three types are: the monolithic organization, the plural organization, and the multicultural organization. In the monolithic organization, the amount of structural integration (the presence of persons from different cultural groups in a single organization) is minimal. This type of organization may have minority members within the workforce, but not in positions of leadership and power.\n\nThe plural organization has a more heterogeneous membership than the monolithic organization and takes steps to be more inclusive of persons from cultural backgrounds that differ from the dominant group. This type of organization seeks to empower those from a marginalized standpoint to encourage opportunities for promotion and positions of leadership.\n\nThe workplace diversity can be categorized into single-gender and mix genders. The study from Joseph and Selvaraj (2015), found out the organization with different genders can provide a better performance than the single-gender workplace environment.Gender diversity turns into a discussion topic to study. \n\nThe multicultural organization not only contains many different cultural groups or different genders, but it values this diversity. It encourages healthy conflict as a source of avoiding groupthink.\n\nA study of successful multicultural organizations (as opposed to monolithic and plural organizations) can be understood by applying theories of leadership which have evolved over time. Trait-leadership theory suggests that leadership is dependent on physical and social attributes of the individual and greatly based on European cultures. Situational leadership, where the balance of managing relationship behavior and the tasks at hand, underscore multicultural organizations.\n\nThe combination of \"transformational leadership\" and \"discursive leadership\" allows and encourages mid-level managers to use diversity as an influential resource in order to enhance organizational effectiveness. In the \"Journal of Applied Behavioral Science,\" C.L. Walck defines managing diversity in the workplace as \"Negotiating interaction across culturally diverse groups, and contriving to get along in an environment characterized by cultural diversity\".\n\nOn one hand, there is a genuine lack of documented evidence for the claimed benefits to the organization and the individual.\n\nOn the other hand, advocates of diversity claim (without presenting evidence) that diversity will bring substantial potential benefits such as better decision making and improved problem solving, greater creativity and innovation, which leads to enhanced product development, and more successful marketing to different types of customers. It is also claimed that diversity provides organizations with the ability to compete in global markets. Simply recognizing diversity in a corporation is also said to help link the variety of talents within the organization. The act of recognizing diversity is also said to allow for those employees with these talents to feel needed and have a sense of belonging, which in turn increases their commitment to the company and allows each of them to contribute in a unique way.\n\nStandpoint theory suggests that marginalized groups bring a different perspective to an organization that challenges the status quo since their socially constructed world view will differ from that of the dominant group. Although the standpoint of the dominant group will often carry more weight, encouraging conflicting standpoints to coexist within an organization which will create a forum for sanctioned conflict to ensue. Standpoint theory gives a voice to those in a position to see patterns of behavior that those immersed in the culture have difficulty acknowledging. From this perspective, these unique and varying standpoints help to eradicate groupthink which can develop within a homogenous group. \nScott Page’s (2007)\nmathematical modeling research of team work reflects this view. His models demonstrated that heterogeneous teams consistently out-performed homogeneous teams on a variety of tasks. Page points out, however, that diversity in teamwork is not always simple and that there are many challenges to fostering an inclusive environment in the workplace for diversity of thought and ideas.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges an organization has when trying to adopt a more inclusive environment is assimilation for any member outside the dominant group. The interplay between power, ideology, and discursive acts which reinforce the hegemonic structure of organizations is the subject of much study. Everything from organizational symbols, rituals, and stories serve to maintain the position of power held by the dominant group.\n\nWhen organizations hire or promote individuals that are not part of this dominant group into management positions, a tension develops between the socially constructed organizational norm and acceptance of cultural diversity. Often these individuals are mentored and coached to adopt the necessary traits for inclusion into the privileged group as opposed to being embraced for their differences. According to the journal article \"Cultural Diversity in the Workplace: The State of the Field\", Marlene G. Fine explains that \"those who assimilate are denied the ability to express their genuine selves in the workplace; they are forced to repress significant parts of their lives within a social context that frames a large part of their daily encounters with other people\". Fine goes on to mention that \"People who spend significant amounts of energy coping with an alien environment have less energy left to do their jobs. Assimilation does not just create a situation in which people who are different are likely to fail, it also decreases the productivity of organizations\". That is, with a diverse workforce, management may have to work harder to reach the same level of productivity as with a less diverse workforce.\n\nAnother challenge faced by organizations striving to foster a more diverse workforce is the management of a diverse population. Managing diversity is more than simply acknowledging differences in people. A number of organizational theorists have suggested that work-teams which are highly diverse can be difficult to motivate and manage for a variety of reasons. A major challenge is miscommunication within an organization. Fine reported a study of \"work groups that were culturally diverse and found that cross-cultural differences led to miscommunication\". That is, a diverse workforce led to challenges for management. The meaning of a message can never be completely shared because no two individuals experience events in exactly the same way. Even when native and non-native speakers are exposed to the same messages, they may interpret the information differently. There are competencies, however, which help to develop effective communication in diverse organizational environments. These skills include self-monitoring, empathy, and strategic decision-making.\n\nMaintaining a culture which supports the idea of employee voice (especially for marginalized group members) is another challenge for diverse organisation. When the organizational environment is not supportive of dissenting viewpoints, employees may choose to remain silent for fear of repercussions, or they may seek alternative safe avenues to express their concerns and frustrations such as on-line forums and affinity group meetings. By finding opportunities such as these to express dissent, individuals can begin to gather collective support and generate collective sense-making which creates a voice for the marginalized members so they can have a collective voice to trigger change.\n\nThree approaches towards corporate diversity management can be distinguished: Liberal Change, Radical Change, and Transformational Change.\n\nThe liberal concept recognizes equality of opportunity in practice when all individuals are enabled freely and equally to compete for social rewards. The aim of the liberal change model is to have a fair labor market from which the best person is chosen for a job based solely on performance. To support this concept, a framework of formal rules has been created and policymakers are responsible for ensuring that these rules are enforced on all so none shall be discriminated against. The liberal-change approach centers on law, compliance, and legal penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOne weakness of the liberal view is that the formal rules cannot cover every aspect of work life, as there is almost always an informal aspect to work such as affinity groups, hidden transcripts, and alternative informal communication channels.\n\nIn contrast to the liberal approach, radical change seeks to intervene directly in the workplace practices in order to achieve balanced workforces, as well as a fair distribution of rewards among employees. The radical approach is thus more outcome focused than focused on the forming the rules to ensure equal treatment. One major tool of radical change is quotas which are set by companies or national institutions with the aim to regulate diversity of the workforce and equal opportunities.\n\nArguments for and against quota systems in companies or public institutions include contrasting ideas such as quotas\nA quota system was introduced at the Swedish parliament with the aim of ensuring that women constitute at least a ‘critical minority’ of 30 or 40 percent of all parliament seats. Since the introduction of the system, women representation in parliament has risen dramatically even above the defined quota. Today, 47% of parliamentary representatives are women, a number which stands out compared to the global average of 19%.\n\nTransformational change covers an equal opportunity agenda for both the immediate need as well as long-term solutions. For the short term it implements new measures to minimize bias in procedures such as recruitment, promotion, and communication. The long term, however, is seen as a project of transformation for organizations. This approach acknowledges the existence of power systems and seeks to challenge the existing hegemony through implementation of equality values.\n\nOne illustrative case for transformational change is ageing management; Younger employees are seen as more innovative and flexible, while older employees are associated with higher costs of salary, benefits, and healthcare needs. Therefore, companies may prefer young workers to older staff. Through application of the transformational concept an immediate intervention provides needed relief while a longer-term culture shift occurs.\n\nFor the short-term, an organization can set up legislation preventing discrimination based on age (e.g., Age Discrimination in Employment Act). However, for the long-term solution, negative stereotypes of older employees needs to be replaced with the positive realization that older employees can add value to the workplace through their experience and knowledge base. To balance this idea with the benefit of innovation and flexibility that comes with youth, a mixture of ages in the workforce is ideal. Through transformational change, the short-term solution affords the organization the time necessary to enact deep rooted culture changes leading to a more inclusive environment.\n\nIntentional \"diversity programs\" can assist organisations facing rapid demographic changes in their local consumer market and labor pool by helping people work and understand one other better. Resources exist through best practice cases of organizations that have successfully created inclusive environments supporting and championing diversity. An example such resources is MentorNet, a nonprofit online mentoring organization that focuses on women and under-represented minorities in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.\n\nImplementing diversity inclusion initiatives must start with the commitment from the top. With a commitment from top leaders in an organization to change the existing culture to one of diversity inclusion, the diversity change management process can succeed. This process includes analyzing where the organization is currently at through a diversity audit, creating a strategic action plan, gaining support by seeking stakeholder input, and holding individuals accountable through measurable results.\n\n"}
{"id": "11558737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11558737", "title": "Dress", "text": "Dress\n\nA dress (also known as a frock or a gown) is a garment consisting of a skirt with an attached bodice (or a matching bodice giving the effect of a one-piece garment). It consists of a top piece that covers the torso and hangs down over the legs. A dress can be any one-piece garment containing a skirt of any length. Dresses can be formal or informal. In many cultures, dresses are more often worn by women and girls.\n\nThe hemlines of dresses vary depending on the fashion of the time period and the modesty or personal taste of the wearer.\n\nDresses are outer garments made up of a bodice and a skirt and can be made in one or more pieces. Dresses are generally suitable for both general and formal wear in the West for women and children.\n\nHistorically, dresses could also include other items of clothing such as corsets, kirtles, partlets, petticoats, smocks and stomachers.\n\nIn the 11th century, women in Europe wore dresses that were similar to men's tunics and were loose, with a hemline reaching to below the knees or lower. By the end of the century, these dresses featured a tighter fit on the arms and women's upper bodies. Dresses were made snug by featuring slits on the sides of the dress that were pulled tight in order to fit a woman's figure.\n\nStarting in the 1550s, middle- and upper-class women in Europe wore dresses which included a smock, stays, kirtle, gown, forepart, sleeves, ruff and a partlet. Undergarments were not worn underneath. In England, Queen Elizabeth dictated what kinds of dresses women were allowed to wear. French women were inspired by Spanish-style bodices and also wore ruffs. French dresses were known as \"marlottes\". In Italy, dresses were known as \"ropa\" and \"semarra.\" Dresses in the 16th century also displayed surface decoration such as embroidery, with blackwork being especially popular.\n\nWomen's dresses in Russia during both the 16th and 17th centuries identified a woman's place in society or their family.\n\nHolland, as a center of textile production, was a particularly noted area of innovation in dress during this time period. During this time period, in Spain and Portugal, women wore stomachers. However, in England and France, dresses became more \"naturally\" shaped. Lace and slashing were popular decorations. Skirts were full, with regular folds and the overskirt allowed the display of an underskirt of contrasting fabric. Necklines became lower as well. Embroidery that reflected scientific discoveries, such as new animals and plants discovered were popular. In the British Colonies, the multiple-piece dresses were also popular, though less luxurious. Wealthy women living in the Spanish or Dutch colonies in the Americas copied the fashions that were popular from their homelands.\n\nThe three-piece dress, which had a bodice, petticoat and gown, were popular until the last 25 years, in which the mantua, or a one-piece gown, became more popular. Corsets became more important in dresses by the 1680s.\n\nWorking women, and women in slavery in the Americas, used simple patterns to create shifts, wool or linen petticoats and gowns and cotton dresses. The bottoms of the skirts could be tucked into the waistband when a woman was near fire when near a cooking or heating source.\n\nLarge, triangular silhouettes were favored during the 18th century, skirts were wide and supported by hoop underskirts. One-piece gowns remained popular until the middle of the century. During the 1760s in France, hoop petticoats were reduced in size. Lighter colors and lighter fabrics were also favored. In Colonial America, women most often wore a gown and petticoat, in which the skirt of the gown opened to reveal the petticoat underneath. Women also had riding habits which consisted of the petticoat, jacket and a waistcoat.\n\nFrench fashion regarding dresses became very fast-changing during the later part of the 18th century. Throughout this period, the length of fashionable dresses varied only slightly, between ankle-length and floor-sweeping. Between 1740 and 1770, the \"robe à la française\" was very popular with upper-class women. In France, the Empire style became popular after the French Revolution. This style was more simple and was also favored by Josephine Bonaparte. Other types of dresses that were popular during the revolution included tunic dresses and the \"negligée à la patriot,\" which featured the red, white and blue colors, symbolic of the revolution.\n\nWomen's dresses in the 19th century began to be classified by the time of day or purpose of the dress. High-waisted dresses were popular until around 1830.\n\nEarly nineteenth century dresses in Russia were influenced by Classicism and were made of thin fabrics, with some dresses being semi-transparent. Elizabeth Vigée Le Brun wore these types of dresses with a short skirt (reaching to her ankles) when she lived in Russia between 1785 and 1801. Many Russian women copied her style. By the 1840s, Russian women were turning to what was in fashion in Europe.\n\nEuropeans styles in dresses increased dramatically to the hoopskirt and crinoline-supported styles of the 1860s, then fullness was draped and drawn to the back. Dresses had a \"day\" bodice with a high neckline and long sleeves, and an \"evening\" bodice with a low neckline (decollete) and very short sleeves. In Russia, metal hoopskirts were known as \"malakhovs.\" Skirts of the 1860s were heavily decorated.\n\nTo sleep, women in the American West wore floor-length dresses of white cotton with high collars displaying decoration. Various Native American people, such as the Navajo and the Mescalero Apache began to adapt the designs of their dresses to look more like the European Americans they came in contact with. Navajo women further adapted the European designs, incorporating their own sense of beauty, \"creating \"hózhó.\"\"\n\nPaper sewing patterns for women to sew their own dresses started to be readily available in the 1860s, when the Butterick Publishing Company began to promote them. These patterns were graded by size, which was a new innovation.\n\nThe Victorian era's dresses were tight-fitting and decorated with pleats, rouching and frills. Women in the United States who were involved in dress reform in the 1850s found themselves the center of attention, both positive and negative. By 1881, the Rational Dress Society had formed in reaction to the restrictive dress of the era.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the look popularized by the Gibson Girl was fashionable. The upper part of women's dresses in the Edwardian era included a \"pigeon breast\" look that gave way to a corseted waist and an s-shaped silhouette. Women called their dresses \"waists\" if one-piece, or \"shirtwaists,\" if it consisted of a skirt and a blouse. The bodice of the dresses had a boned lining. Informally, wealthy women wore tea gowns at home. These garments were looser, though not as loose as a \"wrapper,\" and made of expensive fabric and laces.\n\nBy 1910, the Edwardian look was replaced with a straighter silhouette. French designer, Paul Poiret, had a huge impact on the look of the time. Designs developed by Poiret were available in both boutiques and also in department stores. Popular dresses of the time were one-piece and included lingerie dresses which could be layered. At around the same time, in the United States, the American Ladies Tailors' Association developed a dress called the suffragette suit, which was practical for women to work and move around in. Another innovation of the 1910s was the ready availability of factory-made clothing.\n\nWaistlines started out high and by 1915 were below the natural waist. By 1920, waistlines were at hip-level. Between 1910 and 1920 necklines were lower and dresses could be short-sleeved or sleeveless. Women who worked during World War I preferred shorter dresses, which eventually became the dominant style overall. In addition to the shorter dresses, waistlines were looser and the dominant colors were black, white and gray.\n\nBy 1920, the \"new woman\" was a trend that saw lighter fabrics and dresses that were easier to put on. Younger women were also setting the trends that older women started to follow. The dresses of the 1920s could be pulled over the head, were short and straight. It was acceptable to wear sleeveless dresses during the day. Flapper dresses were popular until end of the decade.\n\nDuring World War II, dresses were slimmer and inspired by military uniforms. After WWII, the New Look, promoted by Christian Dior was very influential on fashion and the look of women's dresses for about a decade.\n\nSince the 1970s, no one dress type or length has dominated fashion for long, with short and ankle-length styles often appearing side-by-side in fashion magazines and catalogs.\n\nIn most varieties of formal dress codes in Western cultures, a dress of an appropriate style is mandatory for women. They are also very popular for special occasions such as proms or weddings. For such occasions they, together with blouse and skirt, remain the de facto standard attire for many girls and women.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27701248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27701248", "title": "Ethnography at the British Museum", "text": "Ethnography at the British Museum\n\nEthnography at the British Museum describes how ethnography has developed at the British Museum.\n\nThe ethnographical collection was originally linked to the Department of Natural History and Curiosities. The addition of material gathered by Captain James Cook and his companions between 1767 and 1780, and presented to the British Museum by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, Cook himself and Joseph Banks, were a substantial addition to the material previously collected by Sir Hans Sloane. But much of this collection was dispersed. Some material found its way to Göttingen, where August Ludwig Schlözer was developing his concepts of \"Völkerkunde\" and \"ethnographie\". However additional material was transferred from the \"artificial curiosities\" held by the museum of the Royal Society until 1781. In 1817 this was supplemented by material from West Africa collected by Thomas Edward Bowdich during his 'Mission to Ashantee', in 1825 by Aztec sculptures collected by William Bullock in Mexico and Captain William Edward Parry's Eskimo material from his second Arctic voyage of 1829.\n\nIn 1836 the Department of Antiquities was established and the ethnographic collection was transferred there. When Christian Jürgensen Thomsen visited the British Museum in 1843, he did not hide his disappointment: he was unimpressed ‘by the British antiquities everywhere covered in dust and not much esteemed’ and complained that the artefacts were displayed without indication of their provenance. An Ethnological Gallery was opened in 1845. In 1851 there were 3,700 artefacts in the ethnographic collection, displayed in a single gallery. In 1852 this consisted of seventy four cases of material from outside Europe: nine containing Chinese and Indian material, 4 African material, 29 material from the Americas with remaining 32 cases containing material from Oceania and South East Asia. Polynesia alone accounted for 15 cases.\n\nIn 1866, the Department of British and Medieval Antiquities was formed under the superintendence of Augustus Wollaston Franks, as Keeper. It included the ethnographic collections. Franks maintained the view that the Museum's collections \"should illustrate the manners and customs of such races as have not been subjected directly to European civilisation, so as to furnish the student with the means of examining the affinities and differences between such races and also to reconstruct some of the last pages of the history of the world\". \"The Handbook of the Ethnographical Collection\" was published in 1910.\n\nThe Department of Ethnography was set up as a separate department in 1946. In 1964 the department received 15,000 items from the Wellcome Foundation, the biggest single acquisition from which they ever benefited.\n\nFrom 1970 to 2004 the Department of Ethnography of the British Museum was housed at 6 Burlington Gardens, displaying collections from the Americas, Africa, the Pacific and Australia, as well as tribal Asia and Europe. This was due to lack of space in the Museum's main building in Bloomsbury. Between 1970 and 1997, the department was known as the Museum of Mankind. 75 exhibitions were hosted, including many famous ones such as \"Nomad and City\" (1976), and \"Living Arctic\" (1987). It was created by Keeper of Ethnography Adrian Digby in the 1960s, and opened by his successor William Fagg. Fagg was succeeded by Malcolm Mcleod in 1974, and by John Mack in 1990. The museum ceased exhibiting at Burlington Gardens in 1997 and the Department of Ethnography moved back to the British Museum in Bloomsbury in 2004.\n\n\n"}

It is the sequel to \"\", and the third installment of the \"F.E.A.R.\" series. It was announced on April 8, 2010, and was stated to include John Carpenter helping on the cinematics as well as writer Steve Niles. It is also the only \"F.E.A.R.\" game to have offline multiplayer, and co-op.\n\nPlayers control their characters from a first-person perspective. The player can carry two weapons at a time, and replenish ammo picked up from dead soldiers and weapon crates. The series' cover system uses a \"peeking\" rather than a \"tilting\" mechanic, wherein players peer and fire around the edges of their cover. Damage displays as a red vignette overlay. When the screen fills, the character dies. In cooperative and multiplayer modes, the player enters a \"Final Stand\" on their death, which lets teammates try to revive the downed player.\n\nIn the Campaign, the player controls either the Point Man or Paxton Fettel. As the Point Man, the player can use weapons, throw grenades, etc. Unlike most characters, the player can use the Point Man's slow motion ability to slow down time, allowing the player to shoot targets with accuracy. As Fettel, the player cannot use any conventional weapons by default; however, they can use Fettel's psychic powers and telekinesis to suspend and throw objects, possess enemy soldiers, crush suspended enemies, and more. In addition to these abilities, the player also has access to the abilities and weapons of any character Fettel possesses, such as Cultists and Phase Commanders. In co-op mode, Fettel can also use the Shield ability to briefly protect the Point Man. Both characters' abilities are gauged by a meter in the reticle, which depletes during use. Both characters' gauges slowly refills when not in use; Fettel, meanwhile, must collect Souls to replenish his Possession Meter. Players have the ability to access and control Armacham technology, such as mech suits. Also, the game has both online and offline co-operative play.\n\nThe game's campaign mode is split into eight \"Intervals\" that can be played in either single-player or co-op. In single-player, when the player completes an Interval as the Point Man, they will unlock the ability to play as Fettel for that Interval. While playing alone or with a friend, the player can complete challenges to raise their rank. Perks include increases to the slow motion and possession meters and new melee attacks.\n\n\"F.E.A.R. 3\" offers four different multiplayer modes, each allowing up to 4 players:\n\nNine months after the events of both games, the Point Man has been captured by Armacham soldiers and interrogated at a prison in Brazil. Paxton Fettel (Peter Lurie), now a \"Spectre\", interrupts the interrogation and helps free the Point Man. The two form an uneasy alliance and escape the prison through the slums. During their escape, the brothers discover that they — and their tortured mother, Alma Wade (Alésia Glidewell) — are being hunted by \"the Creep\", a monster unintentionally formed from the cruel memories of Harlan Wade.\n\nHijacking a helicopter, the Point Man and Fettel return to Fairport to regroup with F.E.A.R. operative Jin Sun-Kwon (Kim Mai Guest). Upon arriving, they discover that most of Fairport's surviving population have been either driven insane by the paranormal activity or executed by Armacham personnel. Despite their differing goals, the brothers successfully meet up with Jin, who plays recorded video footage of Sgt. Michael Becket (Robin Atkin Downes), who claims to have been by Alma and is slated by Armacham for transport.\n\nAmid growing distrust, the brothers assault the local airport to intercept Becket, killing the remnants of the Armacham personnel. In an attempt to gain info from Becket, Fettel possesses him and reveals that Alma is indeed pregnant by Becket, with the increasing paranormal activity a result of her contractions. Becket realizes the Point Man's identity before exploding from Fettel's possession. The brothers head to the old Project Origin facility, where Harlan Wade originally developed the prototypes. There, the brothers start destroying items associated with memories of their childhood past to weaken the Creep.\n\nAfter destroying a monstrous apparition of the Creep, the brothers finally reunite with Alma, whose body has changed drastically due to her pregnancy. The Point Man aims his pistol at Alma's belly, where her third child resides, and Fettel angrily asks him if he is willing to throw his own blood away for orders. As they set themselves at each other's throats, one of two endings occur, depending on multiple factors (such as whether the player has played as the Point Man or Fettel, or in co-op, who has made the most points in 5 different sections of the game's combat.)\n\nIn the Point Man's ending, he shoots Fettel in the head again, forcing him to vanish; then aims his gun at Alma, who gives birth before peacefully vanishing. The Point Man then learns from Jin that everything has returned to normal before taking Alma's baby away with him to safety. In Paxton Fettel's ending, Fettel possesses the Point Man's body and extracts the baby from Alma's swollen body. He then promises to raise the child in his own image before cannibalizing Alma.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, video footage is shown of the Synchronicity Event; the moment when Alma — in a coma at the time — linked telepathically to Fettel (Jeremy Shada) when he was ten years old. The event causes Fettel to go into a hysterical rage, in which he gruesomely kills several ATC security members using telekinetic attacks before finally being subdued. Fettel is heard in a voiceover saying, \"They deserved to die. They all deserved to die.\" and vowing it won't stop until Armacham is completely destroyed in the never ending quest for revenge of his mother.\n\nF.E.A.R. 3 runs on an updated version of the Despair Engine, the game engine that developer Day 1 Studios had used to develop their previous game, Fracture. F.E.A.R. 3's version of the engine incorporates the Havok physics simulation software.\n\nOn April 8, 2010 \"F.E.A.R. 3\" was announced as a sequel to \"F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin\". The game was being developed by Day 1 Studios, in collaboration with Monolith Productions. The game was planned to be released in October 2010 but got delayed until March 2011.

Often they are found in regions of unusual geological activity, particularly volcanic areas, or sometimes at lakes, caves or mountains.\n\nLegends from both ancient Greece and Rome record stories of mortals who entered or were abducted into the netherworld through such gates. Aeneas visited the underworld, entering through a cave at the edge of Lake Avernus on the Bay of Naples. Hercules entered the Underworld from this same spot.\n\nIn the middle of the Roman Forum is another entrance, Lacus Curtius, where according to legend, a Roman soldier, named Curtius, bravely rode his horse into the entrance in a successful effort to close it, although both he and his horse perished in the deed.\n\nLerna Lake was one of the entrances to the Underworld.\n\nOdysseus visited the Underworld, entering through river Acheron in northwest Greece.\n\nOrpheus traveled to the Greek underworld in search of Eurydice by entering a cave at Taenarum or Cape Tenaron on the southern tip of the Peloponnese.\n\nPluto's Gate, \"Ploutonion\" in Greek, \"Plutonium\" in Latin, in modern-day Turkey unearthed by Italian archaeologists is said to be the entry gate to the Underworld; it is linked to the Greco-Roman mythology and tradition.\n\nRivers Cocytus, Lethe, Phlegethon and Styx were also entrances to the Underworld.\n\nThe god Hades kidnapped the goddess Persephone from a field in Sicily and led her to the Underworld through a cleft in the earth so he could marry her.\n\nInto the medieval period, Mount Etna on Sicily was considered to be an entryway to hell.\n\nThe gates of hell were commonly depicted as jaws, forming the Hellmouth, which was simultaneously the entrance to hell and the mouth of a huge monster.\n\nAuguste Rodin was commissioned to make a pair of bronze doors to symbolize the gates of hell. He received the commission on August 20, 1880 for a new art museum in Paris, to exhibit at the 1889 Exposition Universelle, which ultimately did not open; however in 1900, some of them were part of his first solo exhibition in Paris. Rodin spent seven years making the doors, with over 200 figures appearing on it. He was first inspired by Dante's \"Inferno\" but focused more on universal human emotions. During his lifetime the model was never cast and it was first cast in 1925. \"The Gates of Hell\" was described as one of the defining works of Rodin. Having hoped to exhibit his \"Gates\" at the 1889 Exposition Universelle, but probably too busy to finish them, the sculptor stopped working on them circa 1890.\n\nIn China, Fengdu has a long history in the Taoist tradition of being a portal to hell.\n\nHellam Township near York, Pennsylvania, is the subject of a modern urban legend claiming that it contains the Seven Gates of Hell.\n\nIn Derweze, Turkmenistan, a burning natural gas fire in the middle of the Karakum Desert is known as the Door to Hell.\n\nMount Osore in northern Japan is said to be an entrance to hell.\n\nOn the north western-most army outpost in India, during the India Chinese war in 1962, the snow covered Murgo (\"the gateway of death\" in Yarkandi, Uyghur) where Chinese army advance stopped is called the Gate of Hell by the Yarkandi tribal people who cross Karakoram Pass with their caravans.\n\nIn 1878, Rev. Thomas De Witt Talmage delivered a widely reprinted sermon titled \"The Gates of Hell\" at the Brooklyn Tabernacle, based on the scripture Matthew 16:18, message by Jesus to Peter \"...on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.\" Talmage's gates were metaphorical, including \"infamous literature,\" \"dissolute dance,\" \"indiscreet apparel,\" and \"alcoholic beverage\".\n\nIn ancient Indian Hindu tradition the Orion constellation where the vernal equinox is stated to occur, the Milky Way and the Canis were considered to form the border between Devaloka (heaven) and Yamaloka (hell); the Milky Way forming the dividing river between heaven and hell and the Canis Major and Canis Minor representing dogs that guarded the Gates of Hell.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "362373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362373", "title": "Gymnosophists", "text": "Gymnosophists\n\nGymnosophists (Greek , \"gymnosophistai\", i.e. \"naked philosophers\" or \"naked wise men\") is the name given by the Greeks to certain ancient Indian philosophers who pursued asceticism to the point of regarding food and clothing as detrimental to purity of thought. They were noted to have been vegetarian by several Greek authors. There were also gymnosophists in upper Egypt who were called Ethiopean Gymnosophists by Apollonius of Tyana.\n\nIn Greek literature they are mentioned in association with the Persian magi, the Chaldaeans of the Assyrians or the Babylonians, the druids of the Celts and the priests of Egypt etc. Some sources claim that famous figures like Lycurgus, Democritus, and Pyrrho may have met them. They are mentioned by authors such as Philo, Lucian, Clement, Philostratus, and Heliodorus and are thought to have served as models to Cynics as well as Christian ascetics. Many authors have discussed the purported questions by Alexander and answers by the Gymnosophists.\n\nThe term was used by Plutarch (c. CE 46 – CE 120) in the 1st century CE, when describing an encounter by Alexander the Great with ten gymnosophists near the banks of the Indus river in what is now Pakistan.\n\nDiogenes Laertius (fl. 3rd century AD) (ix. 61 and 63) refers to them, and reports that Pyrrho of Elis, the founder of pure scepticism, came under the influence of the Gymnosophists while travelling to India with Alexander, and on his return to Elis, imitated their habits of life; however, the extent of their influence is not described.\n\nStrabo (64 or 63 BC – c. AD 24) says that gymnosophists were religious people among the Indians (XVI,I), and otherwise divides Indian philosophers into Brahmins and Śramaṇas (XV,I,59-60), following the accounts of Megasthenes. He further divides the Sramanas into \"Hylobioi\" (forest hermits, c.f. Aranyaka) and \"Physicians.\"\n\nPhilo Judaeus (c. 20 BCE – c. 50 CE), also called mentions the Gymnosophists twice in the course of listing foreign ascetics and philosophers who are, in his estimation, \"prudent, and just, and virtuous\" and therefore truly free:\n\nIn the 2nd century CE, the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria distinguishes the Gymnosophists, the philosophers of the Indians, from the Sramanas, \"the philosophers of the Bactrians\":\n\nThe Greek word gymnosophist literally meant 'naked sage' or 'naked sophist'.\n\nThe Greeks encountered the gymnosophists in the third century BCE at the town of ancient Taxila in Ancient India, which was an ancient centre of Indian learning. The naked saints, whom Alexander met, are sometimes considered to be Digambara Jain monks, who have continued to practise nudity. According to recent paper by Halkias, the gymnosophists could not have been Jains. \n\nOne such noted gymnosophist was Calanus. Before immolation, he is said to have prophesied the death of Alexander at Babylon.\n\nAnother noted gymnosophist by Greeks was Dandamis, who was the teacher of Calanus. Alexander later learned Indian philosophy from him.\nThe Brachmanes or Bragmanes, who are identified with Brahmanas of Vedic religion who remained unclothed, and whom even Porphyry (c. 234 – c. 305 AD) mentions having lived on milk and fruit, have been identified as gymnosophists.\n\nSimilarly, the ancient Shramanas, which included the Digambar sect of Jain monks, also remain unclothed. They too have been identified as gymnosophists by researchers.\n\nThe school of naked philosophers in upper Egypt was visited by the neopythagorean Apollonius of Tyana (c. 15 – c. 100 AD) who called them Ethiopian Gymnosophists. Apollonius had met the Gymnosophists of India before his arrival in Egypt, and repeatedly compared the Ethiopian Gymnosophists with them. He regarded them to be derived from the Indians. They lived without any cottages nor houses, but had a shelter for the visitors. They did not wear any clothes and thus compared themselves to the Olympian athletes. They shared their vegetarian meal with him.\n\n"}

{"id": "46212346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46212346", "title": "He Never Died", "text": "He Never Died\n\nHe Never Died is a 2015 Canadian/American horror comedy film that was written and directed by Jason Krawczyk. It had its world premiere on 17 March 2015 at South by Southwest and stars Henry Rollins as an immortal, cannibalistic loner who has withdrawn from society to protect both himself and others. A miniseries continuation of the film is currently in development.\n\nFilming for \"He Never Died\" began in November 2013 in Toronto and concluded in December of the same year. The film was released on various video on demand platforms as well as on DVD and became available worldwide on Netflix on March 18th, 2016.\n\nJack (Henry Rollins) has developed a routine for his life that he sticks to in order to avoid giving into the impulse to engage in cannibalism. He stays away from society other than regular trips to a local diner, bingo games, and to the hospital, where he purchases blood from a hospital intern, Jeremy (Booboo Stewart). After returning from one trip, Jack is confronted by mobsters Steve and Short, who are looking for Jeremy.\n\nJack's routine is further interrupted by a phone call from his ex-girlfriend, Gillian, who asks him to find their daughter, Andrea (Jordan Todosey), who tried to contact him earlier that day. Unhappy, Jack agrees to locate Andrea, but stresses that he wants no further contact with Gillian. He finds Andrea and takes her with him to the diner he frequents, where she meets Cara (Kate Greenhouse), a waitress with a crush on Jack. While Jack slowly bonds with Andrea he sees visions of an old man with a goatee, wearing a porkpie hat, and also manages to foil Steve and Short's attempt to kidnap Jeremy. Jack is surprised when he discovers that Andrea can also see the man, as previously only Jack could see him.\n\nOut for vengeance, Short and Steve try to murder Jack, only for Jack to kill Short by tearing out his throat with his bare hands and eating it. Afraid that he'll do the same to Andrea, Jack forces her to leave the apartment. Shortly afterwards Jack kills and eats an obnoxious neighbor. Later, he goes out and tries to pick fights with various people, who turn out to be nice. Eventually, he comes across three young men spoiling for a fight, culminating in him killing one or more of them. Jack ultimately receives a phone call from the mobsters, who inform him that they have killed Gillian and kidnapped Andrea and will kill her if he does not surrender. Jack tries to confront Alex (Steven Ogg), a local crime boss, and the man he believes is responsible, only for Alex to deny that he had anything to do with the kidnapping.\n\nUpset, Jack goes to the diner, where he bribes Cara into helping him save Andrea by offering her a million dollars. She discovers that Jack is actually the Biblical figure Cay'in (Cain), doomed to live as a seeming immortal cannibal, perhaps for killing Haq'bal (whom the Hebrew Bible identifies as his brother, Abel). Jack ultimately discovers the reason why the mobsters were after Jeremy: he had borrowed a large sum of money to pay off his student loans, without repaying it. He also learns of Andrea's whereabouts and goes to rescue her. Alex reveals that he kidnapped Andrea as revenge for Jack killing Alex's father, a mobster Jack once worked for. Just as Jack is about to murder Alex, the man with the goatee arrives, prompting Jack to angrily confront him over his punishment for murdering Abel. Jack demands to know why the man won't let him die, with the implication that the old man is either Death, or Satan because God is referred to as She during Jack's confrontation with the man. Jack ends up choosing to spare Alex in favor of helping Andrea seek medical attention. Before leaving with Cara and Andrea, Jack promises Alex that one day he will see the goateed man. After they have left, the goateed man appears to the very injured Alex, greeting him with a resonant otherworldly-sounding voice.\n\n\nIn October 2014 it was announced that 108 Media were shopping the rights for a miniseries version of \"He Never Died\", which would further expand the film's story and history of the central character Jack. Director Krawczyk is set to return as the director for the miniseries and Rollins is attached to return to portray his character Jack.\n\nCritical reception for \"He Never Died\" has been mostly positive. Film School Rejects and Dread Central both wrote positive reviews for the film, and Film School Rejects wrote that it was \"laugh out loud funny thanks almost exclusively to Rollins’ delivery and reaction shots, but the acts of violence and character details are just as entertaining.\" We Got This Covered was more mixed in their review, which stated that \"\"He Never Died\" is a genre movie that refuses to let itself be defined, but the film's guessing game grows tiresome as the questions only continue to mount.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52570", "title": "Igbo language", "text": "Igbo language\n\nIgbo (; ; ;), is the principal native language of the Igbo people, an ethnic group of southeastern Nigeria. The language has approximately 24 million speakers, who live mostly in Nigeria and are primarily of Igbo descent. Igbo is written in the Latin script, which was introduced by British colonialists.\nIgbo has over 20 dialects, though dialect levelling appears to be occurring. A standard literary language was developed in 1972 based on the Owerri (Isuama) and Umuahia (such as Ohuhu) dialects, though it omits the nasalization and aspiration of those varieties. Related Igboid languages such as Ika, Ikwerre and Ogba are sometimes considered dialects of Igbo; the most divergent of these is Ekpeye. Igbo is also a recognised minority language of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nThe first book to publish Igbo words was \"History of the Mission of the Evangelical Brothers in the Caribbean\" (), published in 1777.  Shortly afterwards in 1789, \"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano\" was published in London, England, written by Olaudah Equiano, a former slave, featuring 79 Igbo words.  The narrative also illustrated various aspects of Igbo life in detail, based on Olaudah Equiano's experiences in his hometown of Essaka. The language was standardized in church usage by the Union Ibo Bible (1916), shortly after completion Thomas John Dennis died in a shipping accident off the Welsh coast, but the Bible manuscript he was working on was reportedly washed ashore and found by a fisherman.\n\nCentral Igbo, the dialect form gaining widest acceptance, is based on the dialects of two members of the Ezinihitte group of Igbo in Central Owerri Province between the towns of Owerri and Umuahia in Eastern Nigeria. From its proposal as a literary form in 1939 by Dr. Ida C. Ward, it was gradually accepted by missionaries, writers, and publishers across the region. In 1972, the Society for Promoting Igbo Language and Culture (SPILC), a nationalist organisation which saw Central Igbo as an imperialist exercise, set up a Standardisation Committee to extend Central Igbo to be a more inclusive language. Standard Igbo aims to cross-pollinate Central Igbo with words from Igbo dialects from outside the \"Central\" areas, and with the adoption of loan words.\n\nLexical categories in Igbo include nouns, pronouns, numerals, verbs, adjectives, conjunctions, and a single preposition. The meaning of \"na\", the single preposition, is flexible and must be ascertained from the context. Examples from Emenanjo (2015) illustrate the range of meaning:\n\n(1) O bì n'Enugwū.\n\n(2) O bì ebe à n'ogè agha.\n\n(3) Ndị Fàda kwènyèrè n'atọ̀ n'ime otù.\n\nIgbo has an extremely limited number of adjectives in a closed class. Emenanjo (1978, 2015) counts just eight, which occur in pairs of opposites: \"ukwu\" 'big', \"nta\" 'small'; \"oji\" 'dark', \"ọcha\" 'light'; \"ọhụrụ\" 'new', \"ochie\" 'old'; \"ọma\" 'good'; \"ọjọọ\" 'bad' (Payne 1990). Adjectival meaning is otherwise conveyed through the use of stative verbs or abstract nouns.\n\nVerbs, by far the most prominent category in Igbo, host most of the language's morphology and appear to be the most basic category; many processes can derive new words from verbs, but few can derive verbs from words of other classes.\n\nMany names in Igbo are actually fusions of older original words and phrases. For example, one Igbo word for vegetable leaves is \"akwụkwọ nri\", which literally means \"leaves for eating\" or \"vegetables\". Green leaves are called \"akwụkwọ ndụ\", because \"ndụ\" means \"life\". Another example is train (\"ụgbọ igwe\"), which comes from the words \"ụgbọ\" (vehicle, craft) and \"igwe\" (iron, metal); thus a locomotive train is vehicle via iron (rails); a car, \"ụgbọ ala\"; vehicle via land and an aeroplane \"ụgbọ elu\"; \"vehicle via air\".\n\nWords may also take on multiple meanings. Take for example the word \"akwụkwọ\". \"Akwụkwọ\" originally means \"leaf\" (as on a tree), but during and after the colonization period, \"akwụkwọ\" also came to be linked to \"paper\", \"book\", \"school\", and \"education\", to become respectively \"akwụkwọ édémédé\", \"akwụkwọ ọgụgụ\", \"ụlọ akwụkwọ\", \"mmụta akwụkwọ\". This is because printed paper can be first linked to an organic leaf, and then the paper to a book, the book to a school, and so on. Combined with other words, \"akwụkwọ\" can take on many forms; for example, \"akwụkwọ ego\" means \"printed money\" or \"bank notes\", and \"akwụkwọ ejị éjé njem\" means \"passport.\"\n\nIgbo is a tonal language with two distinctive tones, high and low. In some cases a third, downstepped high tone is recognized. The language's tone system was given by John Goldsmith as an example of autosegmental phenomena that go beyond the linear model of phonology laid out in \"The Sound Pattern of English\". Igbo words may differ only in tone. An example is \"ákwá\" \"cry\", \"àkwà\" \"bed\", \"àkwá\" \"egg\", and \"ákwà\" \"cloth\". As tone is not normally written, these all appear as in print.\n\nIn many cases, the two (or sometimes three) tones commonly used in Igbo dictionaries do not help users pronounce words correctly. This indicates that the Igbo may have several other tones, possibly up to 8 in total. For example, the imperative form of the word bia \"come\" has a different tone to that used in statement O bia \"he came\". That imperative tone is also used in the second syllable of abuo \"two\". Another distinct tone appears in the second syllabus of asaa\"seven\" and another in the second syllabus of aguu\"hunger\".\n\nThe language features vowel harmony with two sets of oral vowels distinguished by pharyngeal cavity size described in terms of retracted tongue root (RTR). These vowels also occupy different places in vowel space: (the last commonly transcribed , in keeping with neighboring languages). For simplicity, phonemic transcriptions typically choose only one of these parameters to be distinctive, either RTR as in the chart at right and Igbo orthography (that is, as ), or vowel space as in the alphabetic chart below (that is, as ). There are also nasal vowels.\n\nAdjacent vowels usually undergo assimilation during speech. The sound of a preceding vowel, usually at the end of one word, merges in a rapid transition to the sound of the following vowel, particularly at the start of another word, giving the second vowel greater prominence in speech. Usually the first vowel (in the first word) is only slightly identifiable to listeners, usually undergoing centralisation. /kà ó mésjá/, for example, becomes /kòó mésjá/ \"goodbye\". An exception to this assimilation may be with words ending in /a/ such as /nà/ in /nà àlà/, \"on the ground\", which could be completely assimilated leaving /n/ in rapid speech, as in \"nàlà\" or \"n'àlà\". In other dialects however, the instance of /a/ such as in \"nà\" in /ọ́ nà èrí ńrí/, \"he/she/it is eating\", results in a long vowel, /ọ́ nèèrí ńrí/.\n\nIgbo does not have a contrast among voiced occlusives (between voiced stops and nasals): the one precedes oral vowels, and the other nasal vowels. Only a limited number of consonants occur before nasal vowels, including .\n\nIn some dialects, such as Enu-Onitsha Igbo, the doubly articulated and are realized as a voiced/devoiced bilabial implosive. The approximant is realized as an alveolar tap between vowels as in \"árá\". The Enu-Onitsha Igbo dialect is very much similar to Enuani spoken among the Igbo-Anioma people in Delta State.\n\nTo illustrate the effect of phonological analysis, the following inventory of a typical Central dialect is taken from Clark (1990). Nasality has been analyzed as a feature of consonants, rather than vowels, avoiding the problem of why so few consonants occur before nasal vowels; has also been analyzed as .\n\nSyllables are of the form (C)V (optional consonant, vowel) or N (a syllabic nasal). CV is the most common syllable type. Every syllable bears a tone. Consonant clusters do not occur. The semivowels and can occur between consonant and vowel in some syllables. The semi-vowel in is analyzed as an underlying vowel \"ị\", so that \"-bịa\" is the phonemic form of \"bjá\" 'come'. On the other hand, \"w\" in is analyzed as an instance of labialization; so the phonemic form of the verb \"-gwá\" \"tell\" is .\n\nIgbo is an agglutinating language that exhibits very little fusion. The language is predominantly suffixing in a hierarchical manner, such that the ordering of suffixes is governed semantically rather than by fixed position classes. The language has very little inflectional morphology but much derivational and extensional morphology. Most derivation takes place with verbal roots.\n\nExtensional suffixes, a term used in the Igbo literature, refer to morphology that has some but not all characteristics of derivation. The words created by these suffixes always belong to the same lexical category as the root from which they are created, and the suffixes' effects are principally semantic. On these grounds, Emenanjo (2015) asserts that the suffixes called extensional are bound lexical compounding elements; they cannot occur independently, though many are related to other free morphemes from which they may have originally been derived.\n\nIn addition to affixation, Igbo exhibits both partial and full reduplication to form gerunds from verbs. The partial form copies on the initial consonant and inserts a high front vowel, while the full form copies the first consonant and vowel. Both types are then prefixed with \"o-\". For example, \"-go\" 'buy' partially reduplicates to form \"ògigo\" 'buying,' and \"-bu\" 'carry' fully reduplicates to form òbubu 'carrying. Some other noun and verb forms also exhibit reduplication, but because the reduplicated forms are semantically unpredictable, reduplication in their case is not synchronically productive, and they are better described as separate lexical items.\n\nIgbo does not mark overt case distinctions on nominal constituents and conveys grammatical relations only through word order. The typical Igbo sentence displays subject-verb-object (SVO) ordering, where subject is understood as the sole argument of an intransitive verb or the agent-like (external) argument of a transitive verb. Igbo thus exhibits accusative alignment.\n\nIt has been proposed, with reservations, that some Igbo verbs display ergativity on some level, as in the following two examples:\n\n(4) Nnukwu mmīri nà-ezò n'iro.\n\n(5) Ọ nà-ezò nnukwu mmīri n'iro.\n\nIn (4), the verb has a single argument, \"nnukwu mmīri\", which appears in subject position, and in the transitive sentence (5), that same argument appears in the object position, even though the two are semantically identical. On this basis, authors such as Emenanjuo (2015) have posited that this argument is an absolutive and that Igbo therefore contains some degree of ergativity.\n\nHowever, others disagree, arguing that the relevant category is not alignment but underlying argument structure; under this hypothesis, (4) and (5) differ only in the application of a transformation and can be accounted for entirely by the unaccusative hypothesis and the Extended Projection Principle; the nominal argument is generated in object position, and either it is raised to the subject position, as in (4), or the subject position is filled with a pleonastic pronoun, as in (5).\n\nIgbo relative clauses are externally headed and follow the head noun. They do not employ overt relative markers or resumptive pronouns, instead leaving a gap in the position of the relativized noun. Subjects and objects can be relativized. Examples include (relative clauses bracketed):\n\n(6) Ọ zụ̀-tà-rà àkwa [mā-ra mmā].\n\n(7) Àkwa [ọ zụ̀-tà-rà] mà-rà mmā.\n\nIgbo lacks the common valence-decreasing operation of passivization, a fact which has led multiple scholars to claim that \"voice is not a relevant category in Igbo.\" The language does, however, possess some valence-increasing operations that could be construed as voice under a broader definition\n\nAmong the more common valence-changing operations is causativization, which can be expressed in multiple ways. The most common is the verbal root \"mé\" 'do, make,' which forms a compound with the causativized verbal root, as in the (7) below, the causativized form of (6):\n\n(8) Ógù a-vó-ọ-la\n\n(9) Íbè e-mé-vọ-ọ-la Ogù.\n\nA few stative verbs can also be transitivized with the inchoative suffix \"-wa/we\":\n\n(10) Àfe isé kò-ro n'ezí.\n\n(11) Ókwu kò-we-re afe isé n'ezi.\n\nIgbo also possess an applicative construction, which takes the suffix \"-rV\", where \"V\" copies the previous vowel, and the applicative argument follows the verb directly. The applicative suffix is identical in form with the past tense suffix, with which it should not be confused. For example:\n\n(12) Íbè nye-re-re m Ógù ákwụkwọ.\n\n(12) also illustrates Igbo ditransitive word order. Only a double object construction, wherein the indirect object precedes the direct object, is available, to the exclusion of a prepositional dative alternative. Nwachukwu (1987) speculates for this reason that the critical distinction in Igbo is not, therefore, between direct and indirect objects, but rather between primary and secondary objects.\n\nIgbo permits verb serialization, which is used extensively to compensate for its paucity of prepositions. Among the meaning types commonly expressed in serial verb constructions are instruments, datives, accompaniment, purpose, and manner. (13) and (14) below illustrate instrumental and dative verb series, respectively:\n\n(13) Ọ nà-èji mmà à-bacha jī.\n\n(14) Ọ zụ̀-tà-rà akwụkwọ nye m̄.\n\nThe Igbo people have long used Nsibidi ideograms, invented by the neighboring Ekoi people, for basic written communication. They have been used since at least the 16th century, but died out publicly after they became popular amongst secret societies such as the Ekpe, who used them as a secret form of communication. Nsibidi, however, is not a full writing system, because it cannot transcribe the Igbo language specifically. In 1960 a rural land owner and dibia named Nwagu Aneke developed a syllabary for the Umuleri dialect of Igbo, the script, named after him as the Nwagu Aneke script, was used to write hundreds of diary entries until Aneke's death in 1991. The Nwagu Aneke Project is working on translating Nwagu's commentary and diary.\n\nBefore the existence of any official system of orthography for the Igbo language, travelers and writers documented Igbo sounds by utilizing the orthologies of their own languages in transcribing them, though they encountered difficulty representing particular sounds, such as implosives, labialized velars, syllabic nasals, and non-expanded vowels. In the 1850s, German philologist Karl Richard Lepsius published the Standard Alphabet, which was universal to all languages of the world, and became the first Igbo orthography. It contained 34 letters and included digraphs and diacritical marks to transcribe sounds distinct to African languages. The Lepsius Standard Alphabet contained the following letters:\nThe Lepsius orthography was replaced by the Practical Orthography of African Languages (Africa Orthography) in 1929 by the colonial government in Nigeria. The new orthography, created by the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures (IIALC), had 36 letters and disposed of diacritic marks. Numerous controversial issues with the new orthography eventually led to its replacement in the early 1960s. The Africa Orthology contained the following letters:\nIn the early 1960s, a Nigerian government committee created the \"Ọ́nwụ́\" () orthography, named after committee chairman S.E. O̥nwu̥, to replace the Africa Orthography as the official Igbo orthography. \"Ọ́nwụ́\" () consists of 28 consonants and 8 vowels. Up until the present, it has been utilized in government publications, academic environments, journalistic mediums, and literary works.\n\nA variety of issues have made agreement on a standardized orthography for the Igbo language difficult. In 1976, the Igbo Standardization Committee criticized the official orthography in light of the difficulty notating diacritic marks using typewriters and computers; difficulty in accurately representing tone with tone-marking conventions, as they are subject to change in different environments; and the inability to capture various sounds particular to certain Igbo dialects. Calls for reform have been based in part on the rogue use of alphabetic symbols, tonal notations, and spelling conventions that deviate from the standard orthography. The current \"Ọ́nwụ́\" () alphabet, a compromise between the older Lepsius alphabet and a newer alphabet advocated by the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures (IIALC), is presented in the following table, with the International Phonetic Alphabet equivalents for the characters:\n\nThe graphemes and are described both as coarticulated and and as implosives, so both values are included in the table.\n\nTones are sometimes indicated in writing, and sometimes not. When tone is indicated, low tones are shown with a grave accent over the vowel, for example → , and high tones with an acute accent over the vowel, for example → .\n\nThere are also some modern movements to restore the use of and modernize nsibidi as a writing system, which mostly focus on Igbo as it is the most populous language that used to use nsibidi.\n\nProverbs and idiomatic (ilu in Igbo) expressions are highly valued by the Igbo people and proficiency in the language means knowing how to intersperse speech with a good dose of proverbs. Chinua Achebe (in \"Things Fall Apart\") describes proverbs as \"the palm oil with which words are eaten\". Proverbs are widely used in the traditional society to describe, in very few words, what could have otherwise required a thousand words. Proverbs may also become euphemistic means of making certain expressions in the Igbo society, thus the Igbo have come to typically rely on this as avenues of certain expressions.\n\nAs a consequence of the Atlantic slave trade, the Igbo language was spread by enslaved Igbo people throughout slave colonies in the Americas. These colonies include the United States, Cuba, The Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Belize, Barbados, and the Bahamas. Examples can be found in Jamaican Patois: the pronoun , used for 'you (plural)', is taken from Igbo, \"Red eboe\" refers to a fair-skinned black person because of the reported account of a fair or yellowish skin tone among the Igbo. \"Soso\" meaning \"only\" comes from Igbo. See List of Jamaican Patois words of African origin#Igbo language for more examples.\n\nThe word \"Bim\", a name for Barbados, was commonly used by enslaved Barbadians (Bajans). This word is said to derive from the Igbo language, derived from \"bi mu\" (or either \"bem\", \"Ndi bem\", \"Nwanyi ibem\" or \"Nwoke ibem\") (), but it may have other origins (see: Barbados etymology).\n\nIn Cuba, the Igbo language (along with the Efik language) continues to be used, albeit in a creolized form, in ceremonies of the Abakuá society, equivalent or derived from the Ekpe society in modern Nigeria.\n\nIn modern times, Igbo people in the diaspora are putting resources in place to make the study of the language accessible.\n\nThere are some discussions as to whether the Igbo language is in danger of extinction, advanced in part by a 2006 UNESCO report that predicted the Igbo language will become extinct within 50 years. Professor of African and African Diaspora Literatures at University of Massachusetts, Chukwuma Azuonye, emphasizes indicators for the endangerment of the Igbo language based on criteria that includes the declining population of monolingual elderly speakers; reduced competence and performance among Igbo speakers, especially children; the deterioration of idioms, proverbs, and other rhetorical elements of the Igbo language that convey the cultural aesthetic; and code-switching, code-mixing, and language shift.\n\nExternal and internal factors have been proposed as causes of the decline of Igbo language usage. Preference for the English language in post-colonial Nigeria has usurped the Igbo language's role and function in society, as English is perceived by Igbo speakers as the language of status and opportunity. This perception may be a contributor to the negative attitude towards the Igbo language by its speakers across the spectrum of socio-economic classes. Igbo children's reduced competence and performance has been attributed in part to the lack of exposure in the home environment, which impacts intergenerational transmission of the language. English is the official language in Nigeria and is utilized in government administration, educational institutions, and commerce. Aside from its role in numerous facets of daily life in Nigeria, globalization exerts pressure to utilize English as a universal standard language in support of economic and technological advancement. A 2005 study by Igboanusi and Peter demonstrated the preferential attitude towards English over the Igbo language amongst Igbo people in the communication, entertainment, and media domains. English was preferred by Igbo speakers at 56.5% for oral communication, 91.5% for written communication, 55.5–59.5% in entertainment, and 73.5–83.5% for media.\n\nThe effect of English on Igbo languages amongst bilingual Igbo speakers can be seen by the incorporation of English loanwords into Igbo and code-switching between the two languages. English loanwords, which are usually nouns, have been found to retain English semantics, but typically follow phonological and morphological structures of Igbo. Lexical items conform to the vowel harmony intrinsic to Igbo phonological structures. For example, loanwords with syllable-final consonants may be assimilated by the addition of a vowel after the consonant, and vowels are inserted in between consonant clusters, which have not been found to occur in Igbo. This can be seen in the word \"sukulu\", which is a loanword derived from the English word school that has followed the aforementioned pattern of modification when it was assimilated into the Igbo language. Code-switching, which involves the insertion of longer English syntactic units into Igbo utterances, may consist of phrases or entire sentences, principally nouns and verbs, that may or may not follow Igbo syntactic patterns. Igbo affixes to English verbs determine tense and aspectual markers, such as the Igbo suffix -i affixed to the English word check, expressed as the word CHECK-i.\n\nThe standardized Igbo language is composed of fragmented features from numerous Igbo dialects and is not technically a spoken language, but it is used in communicational, educational, and academic contexts. This unification is perceived by Chukwuma Azuonye as undermining the survival of Igbo by erasing diversity between dialects. Each individual dialect possesses unique untranslatable idioms and rhetorical devices that represent Igbo cultural nuances that can be lost as dialects disappear or deteriorate. Newly coined terms may fail to conform to a dialect's lexical formation in assimilating loan words.\n\nProverbs are an essential component of the Igbo language that convey cultural wisdom and contextual significance to linguistic expression. Everyday usage of Igbo proverbs has declined in recent generations of speakers, which threatens loss in intergenerational transmission. A recent study of the Ogwashi dialect of Igbo demonstrated a steep decline in youth's knowledge and use of proverbs compared to elder speakers. In this study, youths employed simplified or incomplete proverbial expressions, lacked a diverse proverbial repertoire, and were deficient in their understanding of proper contextual usages as compared to elders who demonstrated competence to enhance linguistic expression with a diverse vocabulary of proverbs.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10499965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10499965", "title": "Immersion (virtual reality)", "text": "Immersion (virtual reality)\n\nImmersion into virtual reality is a perception of being physically present in a non-physical world. The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images, sound or other stimuli that provide an engrossing total environment.\n\nThe name is a metaphoric use of the experience of submersion applied to representation, fiction or simulation. Immersion can also be defined as the state of consciousness where a \"visitor\" (Maurice Benayoun) or \"immersant\" (Char Davies)'s awareness of physical self is transformed by being surrounded in an artificial environment; used for describing partial or complete suspension of disbelief, enabling action or reaction to stimulations encountered in a virtual or artistic environment. The degree to which the virtual or artistic environment faithfully reproduces reality determines the degree of suspension of disbelief. The greater the suspension of disbelief, the greater the degree of presence achieved.\n\nAccording to Ernest W. Adams, author and consultant on game design, immersion can be separated into three main categories:\n\n\n\n\nStaffan Björk and Jussi Holopainen, in \"Patterns In Game Design\", divide immersion into similar categories, but call them sensory-motoric immersion, cognitive immersion and emotional immersion, respectively. In addition to these, they add a new category:\n\n\nPresence, a term derived from the shortening of the original \"telepresence\", is a phenomenon enabling people to interact with and feel connected to the world outside their physical bodies via technology. It is defined as a person's subjective sensation of being there in a scene depicted by a medium, usually virtual in nature. Most designers focus on the technology used to create a high-fidelity virtual environment; however, the human factors involved in achieving a state of presence must be taken into account as well. It is the subjective perception, although generated by and/or filtered through human-made technology, that ultimately determines the successful attainment of presence.\n\nVirtual reality glasses can produce a visceral feeling of being in a simulated world, a form of spatial immersion called Presence. According to Oculus VR, the technology requirements to achieve this visceral reaction are low-latency and precise tracking of movements.\n\nMichael Abrash gave a talk on VR at Steam Dev Days in 2014. According to the VR research team at Valve, all of the following are needed to establish presence.\n\nImmersive virtual reality is a hypothetical future technology that exists today as virtual reality art projects, for the most part. It consists of immersion in an artificial environment where the user feels just as immersed as they usually feel in consensus reality.\n\nThe most considered method would be to induce the sensations that made up the virtual reality in the nervous system directly. In functionalism/conventional biology we interact with consensus reality through the nervous system. Thus we receive all input from all the senses as nerve impulses.\nIt gives your neurons a feeling of heightened sensation. It would involve the user receiving inputs as artificially stimulated nerve impulses, the system would receive the CNS outputs (natural nerve impulses) and process them allowing the user to interact with the virtual reality. Natural impulses between the body and central nervous system would need to be prevented. This could be done by blocking out natural impulses using nanorobots which attach themselves to the brain wiring, whilst receiving the digital impulses of which describe the virtual world, which could then be sent into the wiring of the brain. A feedback system between the user and the computer which stores the information would also be needed. Considering how much information would be required for such a system, it is likely that it would be based on hypothetical forms of computer technology.\n\nA comprehensive understanding of which nerve impulses correspond to which sensations, and which motor impulses correspond to which muscle contractions will be required. This will allow the correct sensations in the user, and actions in the virtual reality to occur. The Blue Brain Project is the current, most promising research with the idea of understanding how the brain works by building very large scale computer models.\n\nThe nervous system would obviously need to be manipulated. Whilst non-invasive devices using radiation have been postulated, invasive cybernetic implants are likely to become available sooner and be more accurate. Manipulation could occur at any stage of the nervous system – the spinal cord is likely to be simplest; as all nerves pass through here, this could be the only site of manipulation.\nMolecular nanotechnology is likely to provide the degree of precision required and could allow the implant to be built inside the body rather than be inserted by an operation.\n\nA very powerful computer would be necessary for processing virtual reality complex enough to be nearly indistinguishable from consensus reality and interacting with central nervous system fast enough.\n\nAn immersive digital environment is an artificial, interactive, computer-created scene or \"world\" within which a user can immerse themselves.\n\nImmersive digital environments could be thought of as synonymous with virtual reality, but without the implication that actual \"reality\" is being simulated. An immersive digital environment could be a model of reality, but it could also be a complete fantasy user interface or abstraction, as long as the user of the environment is immersed within it. The definition of immersion is wide and variable, but here it is assumed to mean simply that the user feels like they are part of the simulated \"universe\". The success with which an immersive digital environment can actually immerse the user is dependent on many factors such as believable 3D computer graphics, surround sound, interactive user-input and other factors such as simplicity, functionality and potential for enjoyment. New technologies are currently under development which claim to bring realistic environmental effects to the players' environment – effects like wind, seat vibration and ambient lighting.\n\nTo create a sense of full immersion, the 5 senses (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste) must perceive the digital environment to be physically real. Immersive technology can perceptually fool the senses through:\n\nOnce the senses reach a sufficient belief that the digital environment is real (it is interaction and involvement which can never be real), the user must then be able to interact with the environment in a natural, intuitive manner. Various immersive technologies such as gestural controls, motion tracking, and computer vision respond to the user's actions and movements. Brain control interfaces (BCI) respond to the user's brainwave activity.\n\nTraining and rehearsal simulations run the gamut from part task procedural training (often buttonology, for example: which button do you push to deploy a refueling boom) through situational simulation (such as crisis response or convoy driver training) to full motion simulations which train pilots or soldiers and law enforcement in scenarios that are too dangerous to train in actual equipment using live ordinance.\n\nComputer games from simple arcade to massively multiplayer online game and training programs such as flight and driving simulators. Entertainment environments such as motion simulators that immerse the riders/players in a virtual digital environment enhanced by motion, visual and aural cues. Reality simulators, such as one of the Virunga Mountains in Rwanda that takes you on a trip through the jungle to meet a tribe of mountain gorillas. Or training versions such as one which simulates taking a ride through human arteries and the heart to witness the buildup of plaque and thus learn about cholesterol and health.\n\nIn parallel with scientist, artists like Knowbotic Research, Donna Cox, Rebecca Allen, Robbie Cooper, Maurice Benayoun,\nChar Davies, and Jeffrey Shaw use the potential of immersive virtual reality to create physiologic or symbolic experiences and situations.\n\nOther examples of immersion technology include physical environment / immersive space with surrounding digital projections and sound such as the CAVE, and the use of virtual reality headsets for viewing movies, with head-tracking and computer control of the image presented, so that the viewer appears to be inside the scene. The next generation is VIRTSIM, which achieves total immersion through motion capture and wireless head mounted displays for teams of up to thirteen immersants enabling natural movement through space and interaction in both the virtual and physical space simultaneously.\n\nNew fields of studies linked to the immersive virtual reality emerges every day. Researchers see a great potential in virtual reality tests serving as complementary interview methods in psychiatric care.\nImmersive virtual reality have in studies also been used as an educational tool in which the visualization of psychotic states have been used to get increased understanding of patients with similar symptoms. New treatment methods are available for schizophrenia and other newly developed research areas where immersive virtual reality is expected to achieve melioration is in education of surgical procedures, rehabilitation program from injuries and surgeries and reduction of phantom limb pain.\n\nIn the domain of architectural design and building science, immersive virtual environments are adopted to facilitate architects and building engineers to enhance the design process through assimilating their sense of scale, depth, and spatial awareness. Such platforms integrate the use of virtual reality models and mixed reality technologies in various functions of building science research, construction operations, personnel training, end-user surveys, performance simulations and building information modeling visualization. Head-mounted displays (with both 3 degrees of freedom and 6 degrees of freedom systems) and CAVE platforms are used for spatial visualization and building information modeling (BIM) navigations for different design and evaluation purposes. Clients, architects and building owners use derived applications from game engines to navigate 1:1 scale BIM models, allowing a virtual walkthrough experience of future buildings. For such use cases, the performance improvement of space navigation between virtual reality headsets and 2D desktop screens has been investigated in various studies, with some suggesting significant improvement in virtual reality headsets while others indicate no significant difference. Architects and building engineers can also use immersive design tools to model various building elements in virtual reality CAD interfaces, and apply property modifications to building information modeling (BIM) files through such environments.\n\nIn the building construction phase, immersive environments are used to improve site preparations, on site communication and collaboration of team members, safety and logistics. For training of construction workers, virtual environments have shown to be highly effective in skill transfer with studies showing similar performance results to training in real environments. Moreover, virtual platforms are also used in the operation phase of buildings to interact and visualize data with Internet of Things (IoT) devices available in buildings, process improvement and also resource management.\n\nOccupant and end-user studies are performed through immersive environments. Virtual immersive platforms engage future occupants in the building design process by providing a sense of presence to users with integrating pre-construction mock-ups and BIM models for the evaluation of alternative design options in the building model in a timely and cost efficient manner. Studies conducting human experiments have shown users perform similarly in daily office activities (object identification, reading speed and comprehension) within immersive virtual environments and benchmarked physical environments. In the field of lighting, virtual reality headsets have been used investigate the influence of façade patterns on the perceptual impressions and satisfaction of a simulated daylit space. Moreover, artificial lighting studies have implemented immersive virtual environments to evaluate end-users lighting preferences of simulated virtual scenes with the controlling of the blinds and artificial lights in the virtual environment.\n\nFor structural engineering and analysis, immersive environments enable the user to focus on structural investigations without getting too distracted to operate and navigate the simulation tool. Virtual and augmented reality applications have been designed for finite element analysis of shell structures. Using stylus and data gloves as input devices, the user can create, modify mesh, and specify boundary conditions. For a simple geometry, real-time color-coded results are obtained by changing loads on the model. Studies have used artificial neural networks (ANN) or approximation methods to achieve real-time interaction for the complex geometry, and to simulate its impact via haptic gloves. Large scale structures and bridge simulation have also been achieved in immersive virtual environments. The user can move the loads acting on the bridge, and finite element analysis results are updated immediately using an approximate module.\n\nSimulation sickness, or simulator sickness, is a condition where a person exhibits symptoms similar to motion sickness caused by playing computer/simulation/video games (Oculus Rift is working to solve simulator sickness).\n\nMotion sickness due to virtual reality is very similar to simulation sickness and motion sickness due to films. In virtual reality, however, the effect is made more acute as all external reference points are blocked from vision, the simulated images are three-dimensional and in some cases stereo sound that may also give a sense of motion. Studies have shown that exposure to rotational motions in a virtual environment can cause significant increases in nausea and other symptoms of motion sickness.\n\nOther behavioural changes such as stress, addiction, isolation and mood changes are also discussed to be side-effects caused by immersive virtual reality.\n\n"}
{"id": "15604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15604", "title": "James Bond", "text": "James Bond\n\nThe James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is \"Trigger Mortis\" by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny.\n\nThe character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running film series of all time and have grossed over $7.040 billion in total, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with \"Dr. No\", starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of 2018, there have been twenty-four films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, \"Spectre\" (2015), stars Daniel Craig in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: \"Casino Royale\" (a 1967 spoof) and \"Never Say Never Again\" (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, \"Thunderball\"). In 2015 the series was estimated to be worth $19.9 billion, making \"James Bond\" one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\n\nThe Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and two wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as \"Bond girls\".\n\nIan Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond as the central figure for his works. Bond is an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond is known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\". Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war. Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including Conrad O'Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job and Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale.\n\nThe name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide \"Birds of the West Indies\". Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\". He further explained that:\n\nOn another occasion, Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure—an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\"\nFleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself and in \"Casino Royale\", Vesper Lynd remarks, \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" Likewise, in \"Moonraker\", Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is \"certainly good-looking ... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold.\"\n\nFleming endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries. Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's own as was his behaviour, with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming's own. Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.\n\nIt was not until the penultimate novel, \"You Only Live Twice\", that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of \"Dr. No\" in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories. In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in \"The Times\", Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of Glencoe, Scotland, and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond, \"\", gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920, while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.\n\nWhilst serving in the Naval Intelligence Division, Fleming had planned to become an author and had told a friend, \"I am going to write the spy story to end all spy stories.\" On 17 February 1952, he began writing his first James Bond novel, \"Casino Royale\", at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, where he wrote all his Bond novels during the months of January and February each year. He started the story shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend, Ann Charteris, in order to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials.\n\nAfter completing the manuscript for \"Casino Royale\", Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, Jonathan Cape, who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother Peter, an established travel writer. Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books – \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" and \"Octopussy and The Living Daylights\" – published posthumously. All the books were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.\n\nAfter Fleming's death a continuation novel, \"Colonel Sun\", was written by Kingsley Amis (as Robert Markham) and published in 1968. Amis had already written a literary study of Fleming's Bond novels in his 1965 work \"The James Bond Dossier\". Although novelizations of two of the Eon Productions Bond films appeared in print, \"James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me\" and \"James Bond and Moonraker\", both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood, the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s. In 1981 the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with \"Licence Renewed\". Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote – \"Licence to Kill\" and \"GoldenEye\" – were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. In 1996 Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.\n\nIn 1996 the American author Raymond Benson became the author of the Bond novels. Benson had previously been the author of \"The James Bond Bedside Companion\", first published in 1984.\nBy the time he moved on to other, non-Bond related projects in 2002, Benson had written six Bond novels, three novelizations and three short stories.\n\nAfter a gap of six years, Sebastian Faulks was commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to write a new Bond novel, which was released on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth. The book—titled \"Devil May Care\"—was published in the UK by Penguin Books and by Doubleday in the US. American writer Jeffery Deaver was then commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to produce \"Carte Blanche\", which was published on 26 May 2011. The book updated Bond into a post-9/11 agent, independent of MI5 or MI6. On 26 September 2013 \"Solo\", written by William Boyd, was published, set in 1969. In October 2014 it was announced that Anthony Horowitz was to write a \"Bond\" continuation novel. Set in the 1950s two weeks after the events of \"Goldfinger\", it contains material written, but previously unreleased, by Fleming. \"Trigger Mortis\" was released on 8 September 2015.\n\nThe \"Young Bond\" series of novels was started by Charlie Higson and, between 2005 and 2009, five novels and one short story were published. The first Young Bond novel, \"SilverFin\" was also adapted and released as a graphic novel on 2 October 2008 by Puffin Books. In October 2013 Ian Fleming Publications announced that Stephen Cole would continue the series, with the first edition scheduled to be released in Autumn 2014.\n\n\"The Moneypenny Diaries\" are a trilogy of novels chronicling the life of Miss Moneypenny, M's personal secretary. The novels are penned by Samantha Weinberg under the pseudonym Kate Westbrook, who is depicted as the book's \"editor\". The first instalment of the trilogy, subtitled \"\", was released on 10 October 2005 in the UK. A second volume, subtitled \"\" was released on 2 November 2006 in the UK, published by John Murray. A third volume, subtitled \"\" was released on 1 May 2008.\n\nIn 1954 CBS paid Ian Fleming $1,000 ($ in dollars) to adapt his novel \"Casino Royale\" into a one-hour television adventure as part of its \"Climax!\" series. The episode aired live on 21 October 1954 and starred Barry Nelson as \"Card Sense\" James Bond and Peter Lorre as Le Chiffre. The novel was adapted for American audiences to show Bond as an American agent working for \"Combined Intelligence\", while the character Felix Leiter—American in the novel—became British onscreen and was renamed \"Clarence Leiter\".\n\nIn 1973 a BBC documentary \"Omnibus: The British Hero\" featured Christopher Cazenove playing a number of such title characters (e.g. Richard Hannay and Bulldog Drummond). The documentary included James Bond in dramatised scenes from\n\"Goldfinger\"—notably featuring 007 being threatened with the novel's circular saw, rather than the film's laser beam—and \"Diamonds Are Forever\". In 1991 a TV cartoon series \"James Bond Jr.\" was produced with Corey Burton in the role of Bond's nephew, also called James Bond.\n\nIn 1956 the novel \"Moonraker\" was adapted for broadcast on South African radio, with Bob Holness providing the voice of Bond. According to \"The Independent\", \"listeners across the Union thrilled to Bob's cultured tones as he defeated evil master criminals in search of world domination\".\n\nThe BBC have adapted five of the Fleming novels for broadcast: in 1990 \"You Only Live Twice\" was adapted into a 90-minute radio play for BBC Radio 4 with Michael Jayston playing James Bond. The production was repeated a number of times between 2008 and 2011. On 24 May 2008 BBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation of \"Dr. No\". The actor Toby Stephens, who played Bond villain Gustav Graves in the Eon Productions version of \"Die Another Day\", played Bond, while Dr. No was played by David Suchet. Following its success, a second story was adapted and on 3 April 2010 BBC Radio 4 broadcast \"Goldfinger\" with Stephens again playing Bond. Sir Ian McKellen was Goldfinger and Stephens' \"Die Another Day\" co-star Rosamund Pike played Pussy Galore. The play was adapted from Fleming's novel by Archie Scottney and was directed by Martin Jarvis.\nIn 2012 the novel \"From Russia, with Love\" was dramatized for Radio 4; it featured a full cast again starring Stephens as Bond. In May 2014 Stephens again played Bond, in \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", with Alfred Molina as Blofeld, and Joanna Lumley as Irma Bunt.\n\nIn 1957 the \"Daily Express\" approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips, offering him £1,500 per novel and a share of takings from syndication. After initial reluctance, Fleming, who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed. To aid the \"Daily Express\" in illustrating Bond, Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of how he believed James Bond looked. The illustrator, John McLusky, however, felt that Fleming's 007 looked too \"outdated\" and \"pre-war\" and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look. The first strip, \"Casino Royale\" was published from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958 and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky.\n\nMost of the Bond novels and short stories have since been adapted for illustration, as well as Kingsley Amis's \"Colonel Sun\"; the works were written by Henry Gammidge or Jim Lawrence with Yaroslav Horak replacing McClusky as artist in 1966. After the Fleming and Amis material had been adapted, original stories were produced, continuing in the \"Daily Express\" and \"Sunday Express\" until May 1977.\n\nSeveral comic book adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years: at the time of \"Dr. No\"'s release in October 1962, a comic book adaptation of the screenplay, written by Norman J. Nodel, was published in Britain as part of the \"Classics Illustrated\" anthology series. It was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its \"Showcase\" anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).\n\nWith the release of the 1981 film \"For Your Eyes Only\", Marvel Comics published a two-issue comic book adaptation of the film. When \"Octopussy\" was released in the cinemas in 1983, Marvel published an accompanying comic; Eclipse also produced a one-off comic for \"Licence to Kill\", although Timothy Dalton refused to allow his likeness to be used. New Bond stories were also drawn up and published from 1989 onwards through Marvel, Eclipse Comics and Dark Horse Comics.\n\nIn 1962 Eon Productions, the company of Canadian Harry Saltzman and American Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli, released the first cinema adaptation of an Ian Fleming novel, \"Dr. No\", featuring Sean Connery as 007. Connery starred in a further four films before leaving the role after \"You Only Live Twice\", which was taken up by George Lazenby for \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\". Lazenby left the role after just one appearance and Connery was brought back for his last Eon-produced film \"Diamonds Are Forever\".\n\nIn 1973 Roger Moore was appointed to the role of 007 for \"Live and Let Die\" and played Bond a further six times over twelve years before being replaced by Timothy Dalton for two films. After a six-year hiatus, during which a legal wrangle threatened Eon's productions of the Bond films, Irish actor Pierce Brosnan was cast as Bond in \"GoldenEye\", released in 1995; he remained in the role for a total of four films, before leaving in 2002. In 2006, Daniel Craig was given the role of Bond for \"Casino Royale\", which rebooted the series. Craig has appeared for a total of four films and his fifth is scheduled for release in 2020. The series has grossed almost $7 billion to date, making it the third-highest-grossing film series (behind \"Harry Potter\" and the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe), and the single most successful adjusted for inflation.\n\nIn 1967 \"Casino Royale\" was adapted into a parody Bond film starring David Niven as Sir James Bond and Ursula Andress as Vesper Lynd. Niven had been Fleming's preference for the role of Bond. The result of a court case in the High Court in London in 1963 allowed Kevin McClory to produce a remake of \"Thunderball\" titled \"Never Say Never Again\" in 1983. The film, produced by Jack Schwartzman's Taliafilm production company and starring Sean Connery as Bond, was not part of the Eon series of Bond films. In 1997 the Sony Corporation acquired all or some of McClory's rights in an undisclosed deal, which were then subsequently acquired by MGM, whilst on 4 December 1997, MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights to \"Never Say Never Again\" from Taliafilm. , Eon holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.\n\nThe \"James Bond Theme\" was written by Monty Norman and was first orchestrated by the John Barry Orchestra for 1962's \"Dr. No\", although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years. In 2001, Norman won £30,000 in libel damages from \"The Sunday Times\" newspaper, which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition. The theme, as written by Norman and arranged by Barry, was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as \"bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll ... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. And he did it in two minutes.\" Barry composed the scores for eleven Bond films and had an uncredited contribution to \"Dr. No\" with his arrangement of the Bond Theme.\n\nA Bond film staple are the theme songs heard during their title sequences sung by well-known popular singers. Several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song, including Paul McCartney's \"Live and Let Die\", Carly Simon's \"Nobody Does It Better\", Sheena Easton's \"For Your Eyes Only\", Adele's \"Skyfall\", and Sam Smith's \"Writing's on the Wall\". Adele won the award at the 85th Academy Awards, and Smith won at the 88th Academy Awards. For the non-Eon produced \"Casino Royale\", Burt Bacharach's score included \"The Look of Love\", which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song.\n\nIn 1983 the first Bond video game, developed and published by Parker Brothers, was released for the Atari 2600, the Atari 5200, the Atari 800, the Commodore 64 and the ColecoVision. Since then, there have been numerous video games either based on the films or using original storylines. In 1997 the first-person shooter video game \"GoldenEye 007\" was developed by Rare for the Nintendo 64, based on the 1995 Pierce Brosnan film \"GoldenEye\". The game received very positive reviews, won the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award for UK Developer of the Year in 1998 and sold over eight million copies worldwide, grossing $250 million.\n\nIn 1999 Electronic Arts acquired the licence and released \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" on 16 December 1999. In October 2000, they released for the Nintendo 64 followed by \"007 Racing\" for the PlayStation on 21 November 2000. In 2003, the company released \"\", which included the likenesses and voices of Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe, Heidi Klum, Judi Dench and John Cleese, amongst others. In November 2005, Electronic Arts released a video game adaptation of \"\", which involved Sean Connery's image and voice-over for Bond. In 2006 Electronic Arts announced a game based on then-upcoming film \"Casino Royale\": the game was cancelled because it would not be ready by the film's release in November of that year. With MGM losing revenue from lost licensing fees, the franchise was removed from EA to Activision. Activision subsequently released the \"\" game on 31 October 2008, based on the film of the same name.\n\nA new version of \"GoldenEye 007\" featuring Daniel Craig was released for the Wii and a handheld version for the Nintendo DS in November 2010. A year later a new version was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 under the title \"\". In October 2012 \"007 Legends\" was released, which featured one mission from each of the Bond actors of the Eon Productions' series.\n\nFor the first five novels, Fleming armed Bond with a Beretta 418 until he received a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert, Geoffrey Boothroyd, criticising Fleming's choice of firearm for Bond, calling it \"a lady's gun – and not a very nice lady at that!\" Boothroyd suggested that Bond should swap his Beretta for a Walther PPK 7.65mm and this exchange of arms made it to \"Dr. No\". Boothroyd also gave Fleming advice on the Berns-Martin triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by SMERSH and other villains. In thanks, Fleming gave the MI6 Armourer in his novels the name Major Boothroyd and, in \"Dr. No\", M introduces him to Bond as \"the greatest small-arms expert in the world\". Bond also used a variety of rifles, including the Savage Model 99 in \"For Your Eyes Only\" and a Winchester .308 target rifle in \"The Living Daylights\". Other handguns used by Bond in the Fleming books included the Colt Detective Special and a long-barrelled Colt .45 Army Special.\n\nThe first Bond film, \"Dr. No\", saw M ordering Bond to leave his Beretta behind and take up the Walther PPK, which the film Bond used in eighteen films. In \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" and the two subsequent films, Bond's main weapon was the Walther P99 semi-automatic pistol.\nIn the early Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship-grey Bentley Litre with an Amherst Villiers supercharger. After Bond's car was written off by Hugo Drax in \"Moonraker\", Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he used in the remaining books of the series. During \"Goldfinger\", Bond was issued with an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device, which he used to track Goldfinger across France. Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels.\n\nThe Bond of the films has driven a number of cars, including the Aston Martin V8 Vantage, during the 1980s, the V12 Vanquish and DBS during the 2000s, as well as the Lotus Esprit; the BMW Z3, BMW 750iL and the BMW Z8. He has, however, also needed to drive a number of other vehicles, ranging from a Citroën 2CV to a Routemaster Bus, amongst others.\n\nBond's most famous car is the silver grey Aston Martin DB5, first seen in \"Goldfinger\"; it later featured in \"Thunderball\", \"GoldenEye\", \"Tomorrow Never Dies\", \"Casino Royale\", \"Skyfall\" and \"Spectre\". The films have used a number of different Aston Martins for filming and publicity, one of which was sold in January 2006 at an auction in the US for $2,1 million to an unnamed European collector. In 2010, another DB5 used in Goldfinger was sold at auction for $4.6m million (£2.6 million).\n\nFleming's novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as the booby-trapped attaché case in \"From Russia with Love\", although this situation changed dramatically with the films. However, the effects of the two Eon-produced Bond films \"Dr. No\" and \"From Russia with Love\" had an effect on the novel \"The Man with the Golden Gun\", through the increased number of devices used in Fleming's final story.\n\nFor the film adaptations of Bond, the pre-mission briefing by Q Branch became one of the motifs that ran through the series. \"Dr. No\" provided no spy-related gadgets, but a Geiger counter was used; industrial designer Andy Davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy-gadget was the attaché case shown in \"From Russia with Love\", which he described as \"a classic 007 product\". The gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film \"Goldfinger\". The film's success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to Bond, although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that Bond was over-reliant on equipment, particularly in the later films.\nDavey noted that \"Bond's gizmos follow the zeitgeist more closely than any other ... nuance in the films\" as they moved from the potential representations of the future in the early films, through to the brand-name obsessions of the later films. It is also noticeable that, although Bond uses a number of pieces of equipment from Q Branch, including the Little Nellie autogyro, a jet pack and the exploding attaché case, the villains are also well-equipped with custom-made devices, including Scaramanga's golden gun, Rosa Klebb's poison-tipped shoes, Oddjob's steel-rimmed bowler hat and Blofeld's communication devices in his agents' vanity case.\n\nCinematically, Bond has been a major influence within the spy genre since the release of \"Dr. No\" in 1962, with 22 secret agent films released in 1966 alone attempting to capitalise on the Bond franchise's popularity and success. The first parody was the 1964 film \"Carry On Spying\", which shows the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind (Charles Hawtry) and Daphne Honeybutt (Barbara Windsor). One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the Harry Palmer series, whose first film, \"The Ipcress File\" was released in 1965. The eponymous hero of the series was what academic Jeremy Packer called an \"anti-Bond\", or what Christoph Lindner calls \"the thinking man's Bond\". The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman, who also used key crew members from the Bond series, including designer Ken Adam, editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry. The four \"Matt Helm\" films starring Dean Martin (released between 1966 and 1969), the \"Flint\" series starring James Coburn (comprising two films, one each in 1966 and 1969), while \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" also moved onto the cinema screen, with eight films released: all were testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture. More recently, the \"Austin Powers\" series by writer, producer and comedian Mike Myers, and other parodies such as the \"Johnny English\" trilogy of films, have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films.\n\nFollowing the release of the film \"Dr. No\" in 1962, the line \"Bond ... James Bond\", became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in \"Dr. No\" that the \"signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever\". In 2001, it was voted as the \"best-loved one-liner in cinema\" by British cinema goers, and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series. The 2005 American Film Institute's '100 Years' series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the third greatest film hero. He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by \"Empire\" and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by \"Premiere\".\n\nThe 23 James Bond films produced by Eon Productions, which have grossed $4,910 million in box office returns alone, have made the series one of the highest-grossing ever. It is estimated that since \"Dr. No\", a quarter of the world's population have seen at least one Bond film. The UK Film Distributors' Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as they \"form the backbone of the industry\".\n\nTelevision also saw the effect of Bond films, with the NBC series \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", which was described as the \"first network television imitation\" of Bond, largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character the name Napoleon Solo. Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include \"I Spy\", and \"Get Smart\".\n\nA British cultural icon, by 2012, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as Queen Elizabeth II's escort.\n\nThroughout the life of the film series, a number of tie-in products have been released. In 2018 a James Bond museum opened atop of Austrian Alps. The futuristic museum is constructed on the summit of Gaislachkogl Mountain in Sölden at 3,048 m above sea level.\n\nThe James Bond character and related media have triggered a number of criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum, and are still highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse the Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism. Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in the dynamics of the Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that the Bond films reflect imperial nostalgia. American conservative critics, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, saw Bond as a nihilistic, hedonistic, and amoral character that challenged family values.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1958451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958451", "title": "Japanese phonology", "text": "Japanese phonology\n\nThe phonology of Japanese has about 15 consonant phonemes, the cross-linguistically typical five-vowel system of , and a relatively simple phonotactic distribution of phonemes allowing few consonant clusters. It is traditionally described as having moras as the unit of timing, with each mora taking up about the same length of time, so that the disyllabic (\"Japan\") may be analyzed as and dissected into four moras, , , , and .\n\nStandard Japanese is a pitch-accent language, wherein the position or absence of a pitch drop may determine the meaning of a word: \"chopsticks\", \"bridge\", \"edge\" (see Japanese pitch accent).\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following describes the standard variety of Japanese based on the Tokyo dialect.\n\nNotes:\n\nSee below for more in-detail descriptions of allophonic variation.\n\nNon-coronal voiced stops between vowels may be weakened to fricatives, especially in fast or casual speech:\n\nHowever, is further complicated by its variant realization as a velar nasal . Standard Japanese speakers can be categorized into 3 groups (A, B, C), which will be explained below. If a speaker pronounces a given word consistently with the allophone (i.e. a B-speaker), that speaker will never have as an allophone in that same word. If a speaker varies between and (i.e. an A-speaker) or is generally consistent in using (i.e. a C-speaker), then the velar fricative is always another possible allophone in fast speech.\n\n\n\nIn the middle of compound words morpheme-initially:\n\nSo, for some speakers the following two words are a minimal pair while for others they are homophonous:\n\n\nTo summarize using the example of \"hage\" 'baldness':\n\n\nSome phonologists posit a distinct phoneme , citing pairs such as 'big sheet of glass' vs. 'big raven'.\n\nThe palatals and palatalize the consonants preceding them:\n\nFor coronal consonants, the palatalization goes further so that alveolo-palatal consonants correspond with dental or alveolar consonants ( 'field' vs. 'tea'):\n\nOf the allophones of , the affricate is most common, especially at the beginning of utterances and after , while fricative may occur between vowels. Both sounds, however, are in free variation.\n\nIn the case of the , , and , when followed by , historically, the consonants were palatalized with merging into a single pronunciation. In modern Japanese, these are arguably separate phonemes, at least for the portion of the population that pronounces them distinctly in English borrowings.\n\nThe vowel also affects consonants that it follows:\n\nAlthough and occur before other vowels in loanwords (e.g. \"faito\" 'fight'; \"fyūjon\" 'fusion'; \"tsaitogaisuto\" 'Zeitgeist'; \"eritsin\" 'Yeltsin'), and are distinguished before vowels except (e.g. English \"fork\" vs. \"hawk\" > \"fōku\" vs. \"hōku\" ). is still not distinguished from (e.g. English \"hood\" vs. \"food\" > \"fūdo\" ). Similarly, and usually do not occur even in loanwords so that English \"cinema\" becomes \"shinema\" ; although they may be written and respectively, they are rarely found even among the most innovative speakers and do not occur phonemically.\n\nThe contrast between and is neutralized before and : . By convention, it is often assumed to be , though some analyze it as , the voiced counterpart to . The writing system preserves morphological distinctions, though spelling reform has eliminated historical distinctions except in cases where a mora is repeated once voiceless and once voiced, or where rendaku occurs in a compound word: , from . Some dialects retain the distinctions between and and between and , while others retain only and but not and , or merge all four (see Yotsugana).\n\nThe syllable-final moraic nasal, treated as an archiphoneme , undergoes a variety of assimilatory processes. It is variously:\n\n\nSome speakers produce before , pronouncing them as , while others produce a nasalized vowel before .\n\nThese assimilations occur beyond word boundaries.\n\nWhile Japanese features consonant gemination, there are some limitations in what can be geminated. Most saliently, voiced geminates are prohibited in native Japanese words. This can be seen with suffixation that would otherwise feature voiced geminates. For example, Japanese has a suffix, || that contains what calls a \"floating mora\" that triggers gemination in certain cases (e.g. || +|| > 'a lot of'). When this would otherwise lead to a geminated voiced obstruent, a moraic nasal appears instead as a sort of \"partial gemination\" (e.g. || + || > 'splashing').\n\nIn the late 20th century, voiced geminates began to appear in loanwords, though they are marked and have a high tendency to devoicing. A frequent example is loanwords from English such as \"bed\" and \"dog\" that, though they end with voiced singletons in English, are geminated (with an epethentic vowel) when borrowed into Japanese. These geminates frequently undergo devoicing to become less marked, which gives rise to variability in voicing:\nThe distinction is not rigorous. For example, when voiced obstruent geminates appear with another voiced obstruent they can undergo optional devoicing (e.g. \"doreddo\" ~ \"doretto\" 'dreadlocks'). attributes this to a less reliable distinction between voiced and voiceless geminates compared to the same distinction in non-geminated consonants, noting that speakers may have difficulty distinguishing them due to the partial devoicing of voiced geminates and their resistance to the weakening process mentioned above, both of which can make them sound like voiceless geminates.\n\nThere is some dispute about how gemination fits with Japanese phonotactics. One analysis, particularly popular among Japanese scholars, posits a special \"mora phoneme\" ( \"Mōra onso\") , which corresponds to the sokuon . However, not all scholars agree that the use of this \"moraic obstruent\" is the best analysis. In those approaches that incorporate the moraic obstruent, it is said to completely assimilate to the following obstruent, resulting in a geminate (that is, double) consonant. The assimilated remains unreleased and thus the geminates are phonetically long consonants. does not occur before vowels or nasal consonants. This can be seen as an archiphoneme in that it has no underlying place or manner of articulation, and instead manifests as several phonetic realizations depending on context, for example:\n\nAnother analysis of Japanese dispenses with . In such an approach, the words above are phonemicized as shown below:\n\nGemination can of course also be transcribed with a length mark (e.g. ), but this notation obscures mora boundaries.\n\nVarious forms of sandhi exist; the Japanese term for sandhi generally is , while sandhi in Japanese specifically is called . Most commonly, a terminal on one morpheme results in or being added to the start of the next morpheme, as in , (ten + ō = tennō). In some cases, such as this example, the sound change is used in writing as well, and is considered the usual pronunciation, though in other cases, such as abbreviating to (\"-nchi\") this is only done in speech, and considered informal. See (\"in Japanese\") for further examples.\n\n\nExcept for , the short vowels are similar to their Spanish counterparts.\n\nVowels have a phonemic length contrast (i.e. short vs. long). Compare contrasting pairs of words like \"ojisan\" 'uncle' vs. \"ojiisan\" 'grandfather', or \"tsuki\" 'moon' vs. \"tsūki\" 'airflow'.\n\nSome analyses make a distinction between a long vowel and a succession of two identical vowels, citing pairs such as \"satōya\" 'sugar shop' vs. \"satooya\" 'foster parent' . They are usually identical in normal speech, but when enunciated a distinction may be made with a pause or a glottal stop inserted between two identical vowels.\n\nWithin words and phrases, Japanese allows long sequences of phonetic vowels without intervening consonants, pronounced with hiatus, although the pitch accent and slight rhythm breaks help track the timing when the vowels are identical. Sequences of two vowels within a single word are extremely common, occurring at the end of many \"i\"-type adjectives, for example, and having three or more vowels in sequence within a word also occurs, as in \"aoi\" 'blue/green'. In phrases, sequences with multiple \"o\" sounds are most common, due to the direct object particle 'wo' (which comes after a word) being realized as \"o\" and the honorific prefix 'o', which can occur in sequence, and may follow a word itself terminating in an \"o\" sound; these may be dropped in rapid speech. A fairly common construction exhibiting these is \"... (w)o o-okuri-shimasu\" 'humbly send ...'. More extreme examples follow:\n\nIn many dialects, the close vowels and become voiceless when placed between two voiceless consonants or, unless accented, between a voiceless consonant and a pausa.\n\nGenerally, devoicing does not occur in a consecutive manner:\n\nThis devoicing is not restricted to only fast speech, though consecutive voicing may occur in fast speech.\n\nTo a lesser extent, may be devoiced with the further requirement that there be two or more adjacent moras containing the same phoneme:\n\nThe common sentence-ending copula \"desu\" and polite suffix \"masu\" are typically pronounced and .\n\nJapanese speakers are usually not even aware of the difference of the voiced and devoiced pair. On the other hand, gender roles play a part in prolonging the terminal vowel: it is regarded as effeminate to prolong, particularly the terminal as in \"arimasu\". Some nonstandard varieties of Japanese can be recognized by their hyper-devoicing, while in some Western dialects and some registers of formal speech, every vowel is voiced.\n\nJapanese vowels are slightly nasalized when adjacent to nasals . Before the moraic nasal , vowels are heavily nasalized:\n\nAt the beginning and end of utterances, Japanese vowels may be preceded and followed by a glottal stop , respectively. This is demonstrated below with the following words (as pronounced in isolation):\n\nWhen an utterance-final word is uttered with emphasis, this glottal stop is plainly audible, and is often indicated in the writing system with a small letter \"tsu\" called a sokuon. This is also found in interjections like and . These words are likely to be romanized as and , or rarely as and .\n\nJapanese words have traditionally been analysed as composed of moras; a distinct concept from that of syllables. Each mora occupies one rhythmic unit, i.e. it is perceived to have the same time value. A mora may be \"regular\" consisting of just a vowel (V) or a consonant and a vowel (CV), or may be one of two \"special\" moras, and . A glide may precede the vowel in \"regular\" moras (CjV). Some analyses posit a third \"special\" mora, , the second part of a long vowel (a chroneme). In this table, the period represents a mora break, rather than the conventional syllable break.\n\nIn English, stressed syllables in a word are pronounced louder, longer, and with higher pitch, while unstressed syllables are relatively shorter in duration. Japanese is often considered a mora-timed language, as each mora tends to be of the same length, though not strictly: geminate consonants and moras with devoiced vowels may be shorter than other moras. Factors such as pitch have negligible influence on mora length.\n\nStandard Japanese has a distinctive pitch accent system: a word can have one of its moras bearing an accent or not. An accented mora is pronounced with a relatively high tone and is followed by a drop in pitch. The various Japanese dialects have different accent patterns, and some exhibit more complex tonic systems.\n\nAs an agglutinative language, Japanese has generally very regular pronunciation, with much simpler morphophonology than a fusional language would. Nevertheless, there are a number of prominent sound change phenomena, primarily in morpheme combination and in conjugation of verbs and adjectives. Phonemic changes are generally reflected in the spelling, while those that are not either indicate informal or dialectal speech which further simplify pronunciation.\n\nIn Japanese, sandhi is prominently exhibited in rendaku – consonant mutation of the initial consonant of a morpheme from unvoiced to voiced in some contexts when it occurs in the middle of a word. This phonetic difference is reflected in the spelling via the addition of dakuten, as in . In cases where this combines with the yotsugana mergers, notably and in standard Japanese, the resulting spelling is morphophonemic rather than purely phonemic.\n\nThe other common sandhi in Japanese is conversion of or (\"tsu, ku\"), and or (\"chi, ki\"), and rarely or (\"fu, hi\") as a trailing consonant to a geminate consonant when not word-final – orthographically, the sokuon , as this occurs most often with . So that \n\nSome long vowels derive from an earlier combination of a vowel and \"fu\" (see onbin). The \"f\" often causes gemination when it is joined with another word:\n\nMost words exhibiting this change are Sino-Japanese words deriving from Middle Chinese morphemes ending in , or , which were borrowed on their own into Japanese with a prop vowel after them (e.g. MC * > Japanese ) but in compounds as assimilated to the following consonant (e.g. MC * > Japanese ).\n\nSandhi also occurs much less often in , where, most commonly, a terminal or on one morpheme results in (or when derived from historical \"m\") or respectively being added to the start of a following morpheme beginning with a vowel or semivowel, as in . Examples:\n\n\nAnother prominent feature is , particularly historical sound changes.\n\nIn cases where this has occurred within a morpheme, the morpheme itself is still distinct but with a different sound, as in , which underwent two sound changes from earlier → (onbin) → (historical vowel change) → (long vowel, sound change not reflected in kana spelling).\n\nHowever, certain forms are still recognizable as irregular morphology, particularly forms that occur in basic verb conjugation, as well as some compound words.\n\nThe polite adjective forms (used before the polite copula and verb ) exhibit a one-step or two-step sound change. Firstly, these use the continuative form, , which exhibits \"onbin\", dropping the \"k\" as → . Secondly, the vowel may combine with the preceding vowel, according to historical sound changes; if the resulting new sound is palatalized, meaning , this combines with the preceding consonant, yielding a palatalized syllable.\n\nThis is most prominent in certain everyday terms that derive from an \"i\"-adjective ending in \"-ai\" changing to \"-ō\" (\"-ou\"), which is because these terms are abbreviations of polite phrases ending in \"gozaimasu\", sometimes with a polite \"o-\" prefix. The terms are also used in their full form, with notable examples being:\n\nOther transforms of this type are found in polite speech, such as → and → .\n\nThe morpheme (with \"rendaku\" ) has changed to or , respectively, in a number of compounds. This in turn often combined with a historical vowel change, resulting in a pronunciation rather different from that of the components, as in (see below). These include:\n\n\nIn some cases morphemes have effectively fused and will not be recognizable as being composed of two separate morphemes.\n\n\n"}

In 1968, when several names were used to describe the art now known as Minimalism, he predicted that the term \"minimalism\" would \"stick.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, with the rise of the feminist art movement, he frequently wrote in support of art by women. In 1974, for example, he praised Sylvia Sleigh's recent nudes, calling them \"as daring as ever, perhaps even a little bit more daring\" and noting that she was \"always willing to challenge herself and her viewers.\" The following year, he responded positively to Shirley Gorelick's paintings of African-American sitters. In his review of a group show at SOHO20 called \"Showing Off\" (1975), Perreault characterized Sharon Wybrants's \"Self-Portrait as Superwoman (Woman as Culture Hero)\" (1975) as \"more than slightly tongue-in-cheek. But it demonstrates that women artists have egos too, sometimes just as big as any man's. And why shouldn’t they?\" Perreault also praised Alice Neel's portrait of the art historian Linda Nochlin (now at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), calling it \"a knock-out\" and remarking that \"Nochlin looks as if she has just had about enough of Courbet, whereas her daughter is the perfect imp.\"\n\nAt times, Perreault served as a subject for artists, including Alice Neel, whose \"John Perreault\" (1972) is now owned by the Whitney Museum of American Art. The two met when Perreault was working for \"ARTnews\", but the portrait was painted for \"The Male Nude\" (1973), an exhibition that Perreault curated at the School of Visual Arts. As he later recalled, Neel thought he resembled a faun. Perreault also appears with other art critics—all unclothed—in Sylvia Sleigh's \"The Turkish Bath\" (1973). Perreault was later portrayed in Sleigh's 14-panel \"Invitation to a Voyage: The Hudson River at Fishkill\" (1979-99), now owned by the Hudson River Museum. In 1975, a bust-length portrait of Perreault was painted by Philip Pearlstein. Perreault later wrote a monograph on Pearlstein's drawings and watercolors, published in 1988.\n\nLike other art critics, including John Ruskin and Clement Greenberg, John Perreault was also an artist. He created drawings, paintings, and found object constructions. Perreault's first exhibition of paintings and sculptures was in 1965. Later, he aimed \"to attack what he calls the art supplies racket\" by using \"alternate media,\" such as Colgate toothpaste and oil-soaked beach sand. Another preferred medium was instant coffee grounds, which he used \"in honor of\" George Washington, \"the 'inventor' of instant coffee,\" who once maintained a residence near Bellport, New York, where Perreault lived.\n\nIn 2008, Perreault married Jeff Weinstein, his partner of 32 years, in Provincetown, Massachusetts, after same-sex marriage was legalized there. Weinstein, who began as a restaurant critic, has held positions as an arts editor at \"The Soho Weekly News\" (1977-79), editor of visual arts and architecture criticism at \"The Village Voice\" (1981-95), fine arts editor at \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" (1997-2006), and editor of arts and culture at Bloomberg News (2006-07).\n\nPerreault died in 2015, aged 78, from complications following gastrointestinal surgery.\n"}

She explored the complexities of the feminist movements in Japan and the difficulty in launching women's studies in a society bound by dualistic definitions of gender. Coining the phrase \"housewife feminism\", she addressed how Japanese society had attempted to appease women without addressing the underlying systemic problems that continued to foster inequality.\n\nKanai Yoshiko was born in 1944 in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. She graduated from the University of Tokyo (UT) with a degree in literature and philosophy in 1967 and went on to further her education at UT, earning a master's degree education and ethics.\n\nKanai began her career at the newly established Nagaoka Women's Junior College in 1971. She was one of the first academics in Japan to focus on women's studies. She remained at Nagaoka Junior College until 1999, when she accepted a position at Yokohama National University in the Human Sciences Department. She reached the university's mandatory retirement barrier in 2010 and took a post in the philosophy and letters department at Rissho University, from which she retired in 2015. \n\nKanai was most known as a specialist in gender studies and ethics, writing numerous books analyzing the feminist movement in Japan and its limitations. She coined the phrase \"housewife feminism\" to refer to a particular type of issues-based feminism, where the official response establishes quotas and training to counteract imbalances, but does nothing to address the underlying systemic biases. She argued that rather than giving women real power for their own development, the focus of identity politics on nationalist and traditional aims provided pacifiers, such as men taking on more household duties, and led to continued co-opting of women's ability to define themselves and direct policies which affected them. In turn, she found that no radical feminist movement developed in Japan, because women readily accepted a binary gender model and succumbed to pressure to define themselves in the role of wife. By accepting traditional roles, Japanese motherhood is glorified and a one-size-fits-all approach is used to address issues. She has noted that the failure to grasp that \"…equality of sexual power [is] a human right of women and sexual violence against women [is] a violation of human rights\" was a stumbling block to women's empowerment.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3283196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3283196", "title": "Lear, Tolstoy and the Fool", "text": "Lear, Tolstoy and the Fool\n\n\"Lear, Tolstoy and the Fool\" is an essay by George Orwell. It was inspired by a critical essay on Shakespeare by Leo Tolstoy, and was first published in \"Polemic\" No. 7 (March 1947).\n\nOrwell analyzes Tolstoy's criticism of Shakespeare's work in general and his attack on \"King Lear\" in particular. According to Orwell's detailed summary, Tolstoy denounced Shakespeare as a bad dramatist, not a true artist at all, and declared that Shakespeare's fame was due to propaganda by German professors towards the end of the eighteenth century. Tolstoy claimed that Shakespeare was still admired only because of a sort of mass hypnosis or \"epidemic suggestion\".\n\nAfter having recapitulated Tolstoy's indictment and Tolstoy's criteria for literary merit, which Shakespeare does not meet, Orwell writes:\n\nAfter a detailed, itemized analysis aimed to show that a great number of Tolstoy's arguments are false, dishonest and malicious, Orwell identifies Tolstoy's chief quarrel with Shakespeare as \"the quarrel between the religious and the humanist attitude towards life.\" The exuberance with life that characterizes Shakespeare, his interest in everything, the poetic brilliance - the very qualities for which people tend to admire Shakespeare - are precisely the qualities that make him unendurable to Tolstoy, who preached austerity and whose \"main aim, in his later years, was to narrow the range of human consciousness. One's interests, one's points of attachment to the physical world and the day-to-day struggle, must be as few and not as many as possible.\" Since Shakespeare's attitude to life threatens Tolstoy's, Tolstoy is incapable of enjoying Shakespeare and mounts an assault on him in order to try to ensure that others cannot enjoy him either.\n\nOrwell then proceeds to examine Tolstoy himself and notes that the special hatred Tolstoy reserved for \"King Lear\" could well be due to the curious similarity of his own story to Lear's, and to the fact that he suffered disappointments of the same nature after renouncing his estate, his aristocratic title and his copyrights.\n\nIn conclusion, Orwell mentions how little difference Tolstoy's thunderous attack on Shakespeare has made. According to Orwell, the only criterion for the merit of a work of art is that it continues to be admired, and hence, the verdict on Shakespeare must be \"not guilty\", since more than a hundred years after Tolstoy's pamphlet Shakespeare remains as admired as ever.\n\n"}

They are used in a variety of ways: as culinary herbs, landscape plants, healing herbs, teas, and worship implements. All true basils are species of the genus \"Ocimum\". The genus is particularly diverse, and includes annuals, non-woody perennials and shrubs native to Africa and other tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New World. Although it is estimated that there are 50 to 150 species of basil, most, but not all, culinary basils are cultivars of \"O. basilicum\", or sweet basil. Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are hybrids. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus.\n\nBasil cultivars vary in several ways. Visually, the size and shape of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the \"Mammoth basil\" and \"Lettuce leaf basil\" to the tiny leaves of the \"Dwarf bush basil\". More practically, the fragrance of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.\n\n\n"}

It is a sci-fi short film that depicts Palestine as a skyscraper, with each floor representing a city in Palestine. An earlier version of the project garnered attention when it was removed from a competition at the Musée de l'Elysée allegedly due to its political connotations.\n\nThe film starts with a pregnant woman arriving at a train station. She makes her way up an escalator with a travel bag in hand. At the top of the escalator she uses a fingerprint and retinal scan to enter a lobby and walks over to the elevators. As she pushes the button, she looks over to a poster on the wall that reads \"Nation Estate: Living the High Life\". Next to the elevator is a directory for the building floors. Each floor is described as a city or area in Palestine. In the elevator, advertisements play on a television screen. The advertisements seems to address different social and political issues that Palestinians face today, such as water supply, food and travelling restrictions. The first stop the elevator makes is on the 13th floor, Jerusalem. As two other 'travelers' make their way off the elevator, you can see the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The next stop is Bethlehem. As the woman steps off the elevator and walks away, the city's old architecture can be seen as the basis for the floor. She walks into a tunnel that seems to be authentic stone and mortar from the outside, but is more modern on the inside. She stops at a door, and using a keycard in the form of a Palestinian flag, she opens up the door to an apartment. She sets the keycard down, and picks up a watering can. She heads over to a window, and in front of the window, there is a tree growing out of the ground and she waters it. Afterwards, she heads over to a cabinet and opens it up, revealing multicolored cans. When she grabs one and looks at it, it has a label that says 'Mloukhieh', a food native to the Middle East and North Africa. She returns the can and reaches for another, this time it is 'Marmaon'. She heats it up using a fingerprint and pours it out into a bowl, along with other food. She sets it down on the table and makes her way to the window. After pressing a button on the wall, the view changes into one of Jerusalem. The woman holds her belly as she looks on to the city.\n\nIn 2011, a multimedia project of the same name by the film’s director, Larissa Sansour, was selected to be a part of the Lacoste Elysée Competition. However, after being shortlisted for a prize by the museum, Larissa was contacted by the museum staff, informing her that her film was deemed \"too pro-Palestinian\" by the people from Lacoste, allegations which the company later denied. The museum also requested that Sansour release a statement saying that she had \"decided to pursue other opportunities.\"\n\nAfter the work’s removal sparked outrage, Lacoste ended its sponsorship of the £21,000 prize while the gallery in turn suspended its relationship with the company.\n\n"}

The first establishment of this type appeared in Tomsk, Russia in 1882. Soon people's Houses became popular in England (1887, \"People's Palace\"), Scotland, Turkey and other European states.\n\nThe term \"people's house\" (e.g., \"folkets hus\", \"casa del pueblo\", \"maison du peuple\", etc.) was used in continental Europe for working-class community centres, and these were often associated with labor unions and parties.\n\nIn the late 19th century, People's Palaces started being built in grim urban districts. The concept was to raise morale and morality through inspiring buildings which offered cultural nourishment. Costly, taking years to build and lavishly decorated, they were designed to provide a focal point for civic pride, venues for meetings and public events.\n\nNotably these were built according to neo-Gothic style, as promoted by Augustus Pugin and John Ruskin: Pugin believed the harmonious style of the architecture could influence morality, while Ruskin in his book \"The Stones of Venice\" examined the architecture of the Italian Renaissance mercantile republics, believing it expressed the spirit of freedom. Architects adopted these ideas in their building of People's Palaces in the north of England and in Scotland, both to assert the cultural credentials of those regions and to provide an improving influence over the citizens of burgeoning industrial towns.\n\nIn 1899 Joseph Rowntree and Arthur Sherwell proposed that People's Houses should be built as part of a programme by the Temperance Party to provide \"recreations of the simplest and least exacting kind, such as would specially appeal to those to whom the stress of their daily lives leaves little inclination for anything more than physical relaxation and cheerful intercourse\": that is, a viable alternative to the public house.\n\nThe first People's House () was built in Tomsk in 1882, and several more were erected in the capital of Russia, St. Petersburg during that decade. By the beginning of the 20th century the capital supported about 20 People's Houses: these provided entertainment, educational clubs for middle-class intelligentsia, petty officials, students, soldiers and workers etc. Typically, a People's House included a library, reading room, theatre, tea rooms, a bookshop, a lecture hall with stage where activities such as Sunday school, evening classes for adults and choral singing might be held. Some included a museum with various types of visual aids used in lectures in the course of systematic training, and which were also used for travelling and permanent exhibitions.\n\nThe biggest and most famous People's House opened in Russia was built in Alexandrovsky Park in 1899-1900, and opened by Tsar Nicholas II, after whom it was named \"Extaplishment for People's Entertainment of Emperor Nicholas II\" (\"Заведение для народных развлечений императора Николая II\"), or, in short, \"People's House of Emperor Nicholas II \"(\"Narodny Dom Imperatora Nikolaya II\"). This originally housed a concert hall, a theater, a public library and a restaurant. There was a small nominal entrance charge, with the only extra being charged for a seat at the theater. The English publication \"Contemporary Review\" noted these facilities, enviously commenting:\"it is exactly what our People's palace was intended to be and is not\".\n\nMore such People's Houses were built in Moscow and other places in Russia. As a rule, they were usually built in the working-class neighbourhoods. People's houses were subsidized by the Municipal Dumas, country councils and donations of private individuals.\n\nAfter the Revolution of 1917 term \"people's house\" was of seldom use. Most people's houses were renamed into the worker's clubs or Houses of Culture.\n\nIn Western Continental Europe, the \"people's house\" is a generic term used to refer to proletarian community centres located in almost all cities.\n\nWhen the labour movement and trade unions began to organize towards the end of the 19th century, the workers were in great need for premises of their own where they could hold meetings without interference. Opposition against the labour movement from the capitalists and landlords was strong and workers were not welcome to use existing premises. Landowners even forbade open-air meetings.\n\nThe workers in many Western European countries decided to buy their own land and build their own houses. The idea spread all over the country. Construction was funded through co-operative ventures, various forms of contribution and not least voluntary work.\n\nMost Western European \"people's houses\" were built along a similar model as the \"Maison du Peuple\" established in Belgium in 1899; that building was built as the headquarters of the Belgian Labour Party.\n\nAntecedents to the modern \"folkets hus\" in Norway were established by Marcus Thrane's labour movement in the early 1850s. While the movement itself was short-lived and the branches were few, Thrane's attempt was succeeded by the first \"workers' societies\" () by parish priest Honoratus Halling in 1850, which were less politically radical. In 1864, Eilert Sundt established the Christian Workers' Society (today known as the Oslo Workers' Society ()).\n\nHowever, when Danish agitator Marcus Jantzen came to Norway in 1873 to establish a social democratic union, he and his acolytes were prohibited from discussing politics, so meetings organized by Jantzen were held in the open air in Tjuvholmen; by this time, the labour movement in Norway had taken off and largely associated with labour or socialist parties with similar woes of space for meetings, thus increasing the demand for separate facilities. The first modern people's house was established in Vikersund in 1890, and the oldest still existing is the People's House in Spjærøy, Østfold (built 1898).\n\nThe People's House in Oslo was established in 1907, and throughout the 20th century, over 200 people's houses were established throughout Norway. The People's House Association was established in 1947 to represent these establishments, and the People's House Fund is the primary loan provider for people's houses in Norway.\n\nIn Spain, the \"casa del pueblo\" (\"people's house\") is a general term for local branches of both the PSOE party (although the term has been officially retired from most PSOE offices save for those in the Basque Country) and the Unión General de Trabajadores; in addition, the CNT-AIt trade union makes use of similar branch offices, although they are largely described as \"ateneo popular\" or \"ateneo obrero\" (\"people's university\" and \"worker's university\" respectively).\n\nThe term has been used to describe clearing houses of information for Spanish employees and workers, for unskilled agricultural and industrial workers. The first was founded by Pablo Iglesias in 1908 in Madrid; the office was created in a former ducal palace on Calle del Piemonte, and similar houses were established throughout the country afterwards, particularly in the Basque country and in Asturias.\n\nIn Sweden \"The People's House\" () is historically associated with organizations affiliated with the Swedish labour movement. The name is also used for Norwegian and Danish people's houses.\n\n\"The people's park\" (folkets park) is a prevalent feature of many Swedish towns, serving similar purposes.\n\nIn Stockholm, the construction of the first people's house started in 1897 in Norra Bantorget square. It was opened in 1901, and by 1906 the Russian Bolsheviks and Mensheviks were welcomed to hold their fourth congress at Stockholm Folkets hus. In 1955 the original Stockholm people's house was demolished, as was most of lower Norrmalm during the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. It was replaced by the current people's house building, which was built at the same place.\n\nPeople's Houses () were established in Turkey in 1932, to give formal education to adults. The People's House developed programs on language and literature, fine arts, library and publications, history. On July 2, 1932, the first Turkish History Conference was assembled in the Ankara People's House. The activities of the people's houses were subsidized from the state treasury, and served all citizens. \n\nWith the establishment of multi-party politics in Turkey, most of the initial initiatives supported by the Republican People's Party (RPP) began to be questioned during 1945-1951. The opposition Democratic Party (DP) wanted to put an end to the People's Houses. The Democratic Party perceived the People's Houses as a strong political institution among the civilians which propagated the RPP's point of view. The DP wanted to cut public expenses to the institution from the government budget. The RPP proposed to reorganize them instead of closing, as they wanted to preserve the institution as part of Atatürk's heritage. The DP, who criticized the houses for closely identifying with the RPP, rejected the proposal; people's houses and property were confiscated once the DP gained a majority in the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 1951.\n\nThe first \"Casa del Popolo\" (\"House of the people\") built in Italy was in Massenzatico, a small village in the nearby of Reggio Emilia, on September 9, 1893. The Casa del Popolo was inaugurated by Società Artigiana Cooperativa di Villa Massenzatico, in front of some of the most important Italian and European Socialist Party representants as Camillo Prampolini, Filippo Turati and Emile Vandervelde. \nMany Case del popolo have been retasked, though the name is sometimes used in their later names. The name is also used for businesses that were not originally a \"Casa del Popolo\", similar to others such as in Brussels where it is used as the name for a restaurant, or in Montreal for a music bar.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18960210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18960210", "title": "Plagiarism", "text": "Plagiarism\n\nPlagiarism is the \"wrongful appropriation\" and \"stealing and publication\" of another author's \"language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions\" and the representation of them as one's own original work.\n\nPlagiarism is considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics. It is subject to sanctions such as penalties, suspension, and even expulsion from school or work. Recently, cases of \"extreme plagiarism\" have been identified in academia. The modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal emerged in Europe in the 18th century, particularly with the Romantic movement.\n\nPlagiarism is not in itself a crime, but can constitute copyright infringement. In academia and industry, it is a serious ethical offense. Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent, but they are not equivalent concepts, and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement, which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts. Plagiarism is not defined or punished by law, but rather by institutions (including professional associations, educational institutions, and commercial entities, such as publishing companies).\n\nIn the 1st century, the use of the Latin word \"plagiarius\" (literally \"kidnapper\") to denote stealing someone else's work was pioneered by the Roman poet Martial, who complained that another poet had \"kidnapped his verses\". \"Plagiary\", a derivative of \"plagiarus\", was introduced into English in 1601 by dramatist Ben Jonson during the Jacobean Era to describe someone guilty of literary theft.\n\nThe derived form \"plagiarism\" was introduced into English around 1620. The Latin \"plagiārius\", \"kidnapper\", and \"plagium\", \"kidnapping\", have the root \"plaga\" (\"snare\", \"net\"), based on the Indo-European root \"*-plak\", \"to weave\" (seen for instance in Greek \"plekein\", Bulgarian \"плета\" \"pleta\", and Latin \"plectere\", all meaning \"to weave\").\n\nAlthough plagiarism in some contexts is considered theft or stealing, the concept does not exist in a legal sense, although the use of someone else's work in order to gain academic credit may meet some legal definitions of fraud. \"Plagiarism\" specifically is not mentioned in any current statute, either criminal or civil. Some cases may be treated as unfair competition or a violation of the doctrine of moral rights. The increased availability of copyrighted material due to the development of information technology has furthered the debate as to whether copyright offences are criminal. In short, people are asked to use the guideline, \"if you did not write it yourself, you must give credit\".\n\nPlagiarism is not the same as copyright infringement. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different concepts, and false claims of authorship generally constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent. Plagiarism, in contrast, is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation, or the obtaining of academic credit, that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Thus, plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist's audience (for example, a reader, listener, or teacher).\n\nPlagiarism is also considered a moral offense against anyone who has provided the plagiarist with a benefit in exchange for what is specifically supposed to be original content (for example, the plagiarist's publisher, employer, or teacher). In such cases, acts of plagiarism may sometimes also form part of a claim for breach of the plagiarist's contract, or, if done knowingly, for a civil wrong.\n\nWithin academia, plagiarism by students, professors, or researchers is considered academic dishonesty or academic fraud, and offenders are subject to academic censure, up to and including expulsion. Some institutions use plagiarism detection software to uncover potential plagiarism and to deter students from plagiarizing. Some universities address the issue of academic integrity by providing students with thorough orientations, required writing courses, and clearly articulated honor codes. Indeed, there is a virtually uniform understanding among college students that plagiarism is wrong. Nevertheless, each year students are brought before their institutions’ disciplinary boards on charges that they have misused sources in their schoolwork.\" However, the practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software, known as rogeting, has rapidly evolved as students and unethical academics seek to stay ahead of detection software. \n\nAn extreme form of plagiarism, known as contract cheating involves students paying someone else, such as an essay mill, to do their work for them.\n\nIn journalism, plagiarism is considered a breach of journalistic ethics, and reporters caught plagiarizing typically face disciplinary measures ranging from suspension to termination of employment. Some individuals caught plagiarizing in academic or journalistic contexts claim that they plagiarized unintentionally, by failing to include quotations or give the appropriate citation. While plagiarism in scholarship and journalism has a centuries-old history, the development of the Internet, where articles appear as electronic text, has made the physical act of copying the work of others much easier.\n\nPredicated upon an expected level of learning/comprehension having been achieved, all associated academic accreditation becomes seriously undermined if plagiarism is allowed to become the norm within academic submissions.\n\nFor professors and researchers, plagiarism is punished by sanctions ranging from suspension to termination, along with the loss of credibility and perceived integrity. Charges of plagiarism against students and professors are typically heard by internal disciplinary committees, by which students and professors have agreed to be bound. Plagiarism is a common reason for academic research papers to be retracted.\n\n No universally adopted definition of academic plagiarism exists; however, this section provides several definitions to exemplify the most common characteristics of academic plagiarism.\n\nAccording to Bela Gipp academic plagiarism encompasses:\n\n\"The use of ideas, concepts, words, or structures without appropriately acknowledging the source to benefit in a setting where originality is expected.\"\n\nThe definition by B. Gipp is an abridged version of Teddi Fishman's definition of plagiarism, which proposed five elements characteristic of plagiarism. According to T. Fishman, plagiarism occurs when someone:\n\nFurthermore, plagiarism is defined differently among institutions of higher learning and universities:\n\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey of teachers and professors by Turnitin there are 10 main forms of plagiarism that students commit:\n\n\nIn the academic world, plagiarism by students is usually considered a very serious offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution. Generally, the punishment increases as a person enters higher institutions of learning. The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study did not have a good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were very confident that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are. The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.\n\nFor cases of repeated plagiarism, or for cases in which a student commits severe plagiarism (e.g., purchasing an assignment), suspension or expulsion may occur. There has been historic concern about inconsistencies in penalties administered for university student plagiarism, and a plagiarism tariff was devised in 2008 for UK higher education institutions in an attempt to encourage some standardization of approaches.\n\nHowever, to impose sanctions, plagiarism needs to be detected. Strategies faculty members use to detect plagiarism include carefully reading students work and making note of inconsistencies in student writing, citation errors and providing plagiarism prevention education to students. It has been found that a significant share of (university) teachers do not use detection methods such as using text-matching software. A few more try to detect plagiarism by reading term-papers specifically for plagiarism, while the latter method might be not very effective in detecting plagiarism – especially when plagiarism from unfamiliar sources needs to be detected. There are checklists of tactics to prevent student plagiarism.\n\nThere are allegations that some diploma mills take students' money for essays, then produce a low standard essay or close their websites without providing the purchased essay. Students then have little time to provide an essay before a deadline. Also diploma mills have allegedly blackmailed students demanding more money than was originally agreed and threatening to reveal plagiarism to the university unless more money is paid. Sorana Vieru of the NUS said, “We would urge those who are struggling to seek support through their unions and universities rather than looking to a quick fix, and be aware that using these websites could cost not only money but jeopardise their qualifications.”\n\nThere are calls for diploma mills to be made illegal in the United Kingdom, in New Zealand and some juristictions in the United States they are already illegal.\n\nGiven the serious consequences that plagiarism has for students, there has been a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism. This is especially important when students move to a new institution that may have a different view of the concept when compared with the view previously developed by the student. Indeed, given the seriousness of plagiarism accusations for a student's future, the pedagogy of plagiarism education may need to be considered ahead of the pedagogy of the discipline being studied. The need for plagiarism education extends to academic staff, who may not completely understand what is expected of their students or the consequences of misconduct.\n\nSeveral studies investigated factors that influence the decision to plagiarize. For example, a panel study with students from German universities found that academic procrastination predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted within six months followed the measurement of academic procrastination. It has been argued that by plagiarizing students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial and if they have the opportunity to plagiarize. When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur.\n\nSince journalism relies on the public trust, a reporter's failure to honestly acknowledge their sources undercuts a newspaper or television news show's integrity and undermines its credibility. Journalists accused of plagiarism are often suspended from their reporting tasks while the charges are being investigated by the news organization.\n\nThe reuse of significant, identical, or nearly identical portions of one's own work without acknowledging that one is doing so or citing the original work is sometimes described as \"self-plagiarism\"; the term \"recycling fraud\" has also been used to describe this practice. Articles of this nature are often referred to as duplicate or multiple publication. In addition there can be a copyright issue if copyright of the prior work has been transferred to another entity. Self-plagiarism is considered a serious ethical issue in settings where someone asserts that a publication consists of new material, such as in publishing or factual documentation. It does not apply to public-interest texts, such as social, professional, and cultural opinions usually published in newspapers and magazines.\n\nIn academic fields, self-plagiarism occurs when an author reuses portions of their own published and copyrighted work in subsequent publications, but without attributing the previous publication. Identifying self-plagiarism is often difficult because limited reuse of material is accepted both legally (as fair use) and ethically.\n\nMiguel Roig has written at length about the topic of self-plagiarism and his definition of self-plagiarism as using previously disseminated work is widely accepted among scholars of the topic. However, the \"self-plagiarism\" has been challenged as being self-contradictory, an oxymoron, and on other grounds.\n\nFor example, Stephanie J. Bird argues that self-plagiarism is a misnomer, since by definition plagiarism concerns the use of others' material. Bird identifies the ethical issues of \"self-plagiarism\" as those of \"dual or redundant publication.\" She also notes that in an educational context, \"self-plagiarism\" refers to the case of a student who resubmits \"the same essay for credit in two different courses.\" As David B. Resnik clarifies, \"Self-plagiarism involves dishonesty but not intellectual theft.\" \n\nAccording to Patrick M. Scanlon\n\n\"Self-plagiarism\" is a term with some specialized currency. Most prominently, it is used in discussions of research and publishing integrity in biomedicine, where heavy publish-or-perish demands have led to a rash of duplicate and \"salami-slicing\" publication, the reporting of a single study's results in \"least publishable units\" within multiple articles (Blancett, Flanagin, & Young, 1995; Jefferson, 1998; Kassirer & Angell, 1995; Lowe, 2003; McCarthy, 1993; Schein & Paladugu, 2001; Wheeler, 1989). Roig (2002) offers a useful classification system including four types of self-plagiarism: duplicate publication of an article in more than one journal; partitioning of one study into multiple publications, often called salami-slicing; text recycling; and copyright infringement.\n\nSome academic journals have codes of ethics that specifically refer to self-plagiarism. For example, the \"Journal of International Business Studies\". Some professional organizations like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) have created policies that deal specifically with self-plagiarism. Other organizations do not make specific reference to self-plagiarism such as the American Political Science Association (APSA). The organization published a code of ethics that describes plagiarism as \"...deliberate appropriation of the works of others represented as one's own.\" It does not make any reference to self-plagiarism. It does say that when a thesis or dissertation is published \"in whole or in part\", the author is \"not ordinarily under an ethical obligation to acknowledge its origins.\" The American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) also published a code of ethics that says its members are committed to: \"Ensure that others receive credit for their work and contributions,\" but it makes no reference to self-plagiarism.\n\nPamela Samuelson, in 1994, identified several factors she says excuse reuse of one's previously published work, that make it not self-plagiarism. She relates each of these factors specifically to the ethical issue of self-plagiarism, as distinct from the legal issue of fair use of copyright, which she deals with separately. Among other factors that may excuse reuse of previously published material Samuelson lists the following:\n\n\nSamuelson states she has relied on the \"different audience\" rationale when attempting to bridge interdisciplinary communities. She refers to writing for different legal and technical communities, saying: \"there are often paragraphs or sequences of paragraphs that can be bodily lifted from one article to the other. And, in truth, I lift them.\" She refers to her own practice of converting \"a technical article into a law review article with relatively few changes—adding footnotes and one substantive section\" for a different audience.\n\nSamuelson describes misrepresentation as the basis of self-plagiarism. She also states \"Although it seems not to have been raised in any of the self-plagiarism cases, copyrights law's fair use defense would likely provide a shield against many potential publisher claims of copyright infringement against authors who reused portions of their previous works.\"\n\nPlagiarism is presumably not an issue when organizations issue collective unsigned works since they do not assign credit for originality to particular people. For example, the American Historical Association's \"Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct\" (2005) regarding textbooks and reference books states that, since textbooks and encyclopedias are summaries of other scholars' work, they are not bound by the same exacting standards of attribution as original research and may be allowed a greater \"extent of dependence\" on other works. However, even such a book does not make use of words, phrases, or paragraphs from another text or follow too closely the other text's arrangement and organization, and the authors of such texts are also expected to \"acknowledge the sources of recent or distinctive findings and interpretations, those not yet a part of the common understanding of the profession.\"\n\nThrough all of the history of literature and of the arts in general, works of art are for a large part repetitions of the tradition; to the entire history of artistic creativity belong plagiarism, literary theft, appropriation, incorporation, retelling, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, reprise, thematic variation, ironic retake, parody, imitation, stylistic theft, pastiches, collages, and deliberate assemblages. There is no rigorous and precise distinction between practices like imitation, stylistic plagiarism, copy, replica and forgery. These appropriation procedures are the main axis of a literate culture, in which the tradition of the canonic past is being constantly rewritten.\n\nRuth Graham quotes T.S. Eliot—\"Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal. Bad poets deface what they take.\"—she notes that despite the \"taboo\" of plagiarism, the ill-will and embarrassment it causes in the modern context, readers seem to often forgive the past excesses of historic literary offenders.\n\nA passage of Laurence Sterne's 1767 \"Tristram Shandy\" condemns plagiarism by resorting to plagiarism. Oliver Goldsmith commented:\n\nSterne's Writings, in which it is clearly shewn, that he, whose manner and style were so long thought original, was, in fact, the most unhesitating plagiarist who ever cribbed from his predecessors in order to garnish his own pages. It must be owned, at the same time, that Sterne selects the materials of his mosaic work with so much art, places them so well, and polishes them so highly, that in most cases we are disposed to pardon the want of originality, in consideration of the exquisite talent with which the borrowed materials are wrought up into the new form.\n\nFree online tools are becoming available to help identify plagiarism, and there are a range of approaches that attempt to limit online copying, such as disabling right clicking and placing warning banners regarding copyrights on web pages. Instances of plagiarism that involve copyright violation may be addressed by the rightful content owners sending a DMCA removal notice to the offending site-owner, or to the ISP that is hosting the offending site. The term \"content scraping\" has arisen to describe the copying and pasting of information from websites and blogs.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2595389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2595389", "title": "Rabbit rabbit rabbit", "text": "Rabbit rabbit rabbit\n\n\"Rabbit rabbit rabbit\" is a superstition found in Britain and North America wherein a person says or repeats the words \"rabbit\", \"rabbits\" and/or \"white rabbits\" aloud upon waking on the first day of a month, to ensure good luck for the rest of it.\n\nThe exact origin of the superstition is unknown, though it was recorded in \"Notes and Queries\" as being said by children in 1909:\n\"My two daughters are in the habit of saying 'Rabbits!' on the first day of each month. The word must be spoken aloud, and be the first word said in the month. It brings luck for that month. Other children, I find, use the same formula.\"\nIn response to this note another contributor said that his daughter believed that the outcome would be a present, and that the word must be spoken up the chimney to be most effective; another pointed out that the word \"rabbit\" was often used in expletives, and suggested that the superstition may be a survival of the ancient belief in swearing as a means of avoiding evil. People continue to express curiosity about the origins of this superstition and draw upon it for inspiration in making calendars suggestive of the Labors of the Months, thus linking the \"rabbit rabbit\" superstition to seasonal fertility.\n\nIt appeared in a work of fiction in 1922:\n\"Why,\" the man in the brown hat laughed at him, \"I thought everybody knew 'Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit.' If you say 'Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit'—three times, just like that—first thing in the morning on the first of the month, even before you say your prayers, you'll get a present before the end of the month.\"\n\nChapter 1 of the Trixie Belden story \"The Mystery of the Emeralds\" (1962) is titled “Rabbit! Rabbit!” and discusses the tradition:\nTrixie Belden awoke slowly, with the sound of a summer rain beating against her window. She half-opened her eyes, stretched her arms above her head, and then, catching sight of a large sign tied to the foot of her bed, yelled out, “Rabbit! Rabbit!” She bounced out of bed and ran out of her room and down the hall. “I’ve finally done it!” she cried [...] “Well, ever since I was Bobby’s age I’ve been trying to remember to say ‘Rabbit! Rabbit!’ and make a wish just before going to sleep on the last night of the month. If you say it again in the morning, before you’ve said another word, your wish comes true.” Trixie laughed.\"\n\nIn the United States the tradition appears especially well known in northern New England although, like all folklore, determining its exact area of distribution is difficult. The superstition may be related to the broader belief in the rabbit or hare being a \"lucky\" animal, as exhibited in the practice of carrying a rabbit's foot for luck.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, U.S. children's cable channel Nickelodeon helped popularize the superstition in the United States as part of its \"Nick Days,\" where during commercial breaks it would show an ad about the significance of the current date, whether it be an actual holiday, a largely uncelebrated unofficial holiday, or a made-up day if nothing else is going on that specific day. (The latter would be identified as a \"Nickelodeon holiday.\") Nickelodeon would promote the last day of each month as \"Rabbit Rabbit Day\" and to remind kids to say it the next day, unless the last day of that specific month was an actual holiday, such as Halloween or New Year's Eve. This practice stopped by the late 1990s.\n\nRabbits have not always been thought of as lucky, however. In the 19th century, for example, fishermen would not say the word while at sea, in South Devon to see a white rabbit in one's village when a person was very ill was regarded as a sure sign that the person was about to die.\n\nThere is another folk tradition which may use a variation \"Rabbit\", \"Bunny\", \"I hate/love Grey Rabbits\" or \"White Rabbit\" to ward off smoke that the wind is directing into your face when gathered around a campfire. It is thought that this tradition may be related to the tradition of invoking the rabbit on the first of the month. Others conjecture that it may originate with a North American First Nation story about smoke resembling rabbit fur. This tradition may be more of a social tradition in a group setting than a genuine belief that certain words will change the wind direction, and may be more of a childhood tradition than an adult one. Children have sometimes adapted from Rabbit to \"Pink Elephant\" or other comical derivatives. Because of this more mutable usage, historical record of this is even more scarce than other more static meanings.\n\nAs with all folklore, its truth is made evident even in its only occasional fulfillment: should the wind then appear to change direction, others will interpret the use of such an expression as evidence of its effectiveness and will then tend to adopt and repeat its use. That multiple instances of its \"in\"effectiveness also exist is discounted in light of the \"fact\" that it appeared to work once.\n\nAs with most folklore, which is traditionally spread by word of mouth, there are numerous variants of the superstition, in some cases specific to a certain time period or region.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "460110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=460110", "title": "Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy", "text": "Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy\n\nThe Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy is a trilogy of novels by American writer Robert Anton Wilson consisting of The Universe Next Door, The Trick Top Hat, and The Homing Pigeons, each illustrating a different interpretation of quantum physics. Wilson is also co-author of \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\", and \"Schrödinger's Cat\" is a sequel of sorts, re-using several of the same characters and carrying on many of the themes of the earlier work.\n\nThe one-volume edition currently in print is significantly shorter than the original three-volume edition. This is not a difference in print size or removal of redundant \"recaps\"; it is missing a noticeable amount of material, including many entire chapters.\n\nThe name Schrödinger's Cat comes from a thought experiment in quantum mechanics. The first book, \"The Universe Next Door\", takes place in different universes in accord with the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics; in the second, \"The Trick Top Hat\", characters are unknowingly connected through non-locality, i.e., having once crossed paths they are joined in quantum entanglement; and the third book, \"The Homing Pigeons\", places characters in an \"observer-created universe\" in which Consciousness Causes the Collapse of the wavefunction.\n\nTaking place in Unistat, which is the novel's parallel to the United States, the novels have intertwining plots involving a wide array of characters, including:\n\n\nIn \"The Universe Next Door\", the President of Unistat is Furbish Lousewart V; in that universe, a terrorist organization known as Purity of Essence (named after General Ripper's obsession in the film \"\") threatens to detonate nuclear devices in major cities all over Unistat. Also mirroring \"Dr. Strangelove\", Unistat has an automated device that will send nuclear missiles to Russia in the event of such an attack. Russia has a similar device to bomb China, and so on.\n\nIn \"The Trick Top Hat\", President Hubbard, promotes a scientific approach to the improvement of life: she offers rewards to anyone who can design a robot to do their job or develop methods to prolong life. Eventually Unistat becomes a Utopia. She makes the whole law system into three different laws: victimless crimes, which have no punishment; crimes against property, which involve debt and payment; and serious crimes, such as murder, which result in being sent to Hell, a place like jail but not quite. It's encased in laser shielding and is like a primitive world all its own. It is, in fact, the State of Mississippi. The original Pocket Books edition of \"The Trick Top Hat\" contains many passages, some sexually explicit, that are not included in later editions, including the Dell softcover. Much of this material first appeared in Wilson's earlier novel, \"The Sex Magicians\", published as pornography by Sheffield House in 1973.\n\nThe third volume, \"The Homing Pigeons\", features , although it has very little to do with the President. Near the end of the book it keeps switching universes, some of which contain President Kennedy, others which contain President Lousewort, and still others in which Hubbard is the president. Like \"The Trick Top Hat\", \"The Homing Pigeons\" also has material in the Pocket Books edition that is not in later editions. Unlike \"The Trick Top Hat\", however, the material that was cut out did not contain particularly sexually explicit content.\n\nThe main plots throughout these books are many. One follows Markoff Chaney, a midget, and his pranks played on the world that continuously screws him over. Most of his pranks are played on Dr. Dashwood, of Orgasm Research. However, the most important plot line follows the path of one Hugh Crane which may or may not be this Universe's Hagbard Celine; a character that is an obvious representation of Wilson himself.\n\nAnother follows an \"Ithyphallic Eidolon\", a penis removed from a transsexual woman named Epicene (post-surgery, Mary Margaret) Wildebloode. She puts it on display on her mantelpiece, where it gets stolen. It passes through the vicinity of almost every character in the series at least once.\n\nThere are dozens of conspiracy theories, strange loops, satire and paranoia included within those pages. In addition, there are numerous references to other works and occasional outright appropriation of characters from them (including cameos by Captain Ahab and Lemuel Gulliver, among others). Many of the character names are either puns (Bertha van Ation refers to the film \"Birth of a Nation\", Juan Tootrego) or references to historical personages (Blake Williams refers to the poet William Blake, Francis Dashwood's name refers to Sir Francis Dashwood).\n\n\"Tanstagi\", an acronym standing for \"There Ain't No Such Thing As Government Interference\", is the motto of the Invisible Hand Society, an originally fictional organization invented in the \"Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy\". The acronym was deliberately intended as a reference to Robert A. Heinlein's TANSTAAFL principle.\n\nThe Tanstagi principle is meant to imply that the invisible hand of the free market applies to government as well. In other words, contrary to traditional ideas of laissez-faire capitalism, government interference in the free market is impossible, since governments are inextricably a part of the market as a whole. 'Government' is not a separate institution—it is a word used to describe the actions of a large number of individuals subject to the same (at least qualitatively) pressures as everyone else. Both of these ideas are part of what is known as 'economic Taoism.'\n\nWhile it was first introduced in a novel, people claiming to be members or know of chapters of the Invisible Hand Society have occasionally appeared in editorial pages and on the Internet.\n\nThe \"Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy\" is a fictional story, with much interpersonal dialogue between characters. This dialogue frequently makes use of slang words invented by the author, as a substitute for words that were, in the 1970s, typically taboo to speak about in modern western culture. In case a censorship case was brought against the book, Wilson made use of the names of Supreme Court Justices as \"stand ins\" for certain words. Examples include \"Potter Stewarting\", an expression used as a substitute for a common word that refers to the act of copulation, and \"Burgering\", referring to the act of voiding one's bowels (referring to Chief Justice of the United States from 1969–1986, Warren E. Burger), etc.\n"}
{"id": "1684866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1684866", "title": "Shaq Fu", "text": "Shaq Fu\n\nShaq Fu is a 2D fighting game released for the Genesis and Super NES on October 28, 1994. It was ported to the Game Gear, Game Boy, and Amiga platforms in 1995. The game was published by Electronic Arts and developed by the now-defunct Delphine Software International. It features former professional basketball player Shaquille \"Shaq\" O'Neal as the player character. \"Shaq Fu\" was met with mixed responses from critics upon release, though it has since come to be considered one of the worst video games of all time.\n\nA sequel, \"Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn\", was announced in March 2014, and was released on June 5, 2018.\n\nIn the game's storyline, Shaquille O'Neal walks into a dojo while heading to a charity basketball game in Tokyo, Japan. After speaking with Leotsu, a martial arts master, Shaq goes to another dimension, the Second World, where he must rescue a young boy named Nezu from the evil mummy Sett Ra.\n\nWhile initially pitched as a Basketball game, \"Shaq Fu\" became a fighting game after talks with Shaq, who is a self-proclaimed fan of \"Mortal Kombat\"; Delphine acknowledged that they could not compete directly with \"\" from a technical perspective, instead building a game that highlighted the team's strengths at computer animations. The same rotoscoping techniques were used in their 1992 title \"Flashback: The Quest for Identity\", where actors would be filmed against a Blue Screen, the frames would be digitized with the help of a Silicon Graphics SGI workstation, and artists would touch up the results using some of the roughly 7000 original character sketches as a base for defining characters. Shaq portrays himself in the game, though many sequences were directed by a Kung Fu expert; other characters were filmed by movie stuntmen and women, and O'Neal also assisted with some of the dialogue. Roughly 40 people worked on the project in total.\n\nTo promote the game's launch, Shaq released his second studio rap album, \"Shaq Fu: Da Return\", which peaked at #67 in the US' Billboard 200 chart and #19 in Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart; those who pre-ordered or purchased the console versions of the game in its initial launch also had gotten a Promotional CD featuring the track \"Stand and Deliver\".\n\nThe Genesis version of \"Shaq Fu\" has five more playable characters (Auroch, Colonel, Diesel, Leotsu, and Nezu) and three more stages (The Lab, The Wasteland, and Yasko Mines) than the Super NES version, thus the Genesis version has a longer story mode. The North Gate/South Gate stage is accessible in the SNES version with a cheat code, whereas the Genesis version has the North Gate/South Gate stage available by default. The Amiga version contains the same content as the Genesis version (it keeps the text \"Licensed by Sega Enterprises, LTD\" left over from that version on the title screen), though the backgrounds have no animation. It also only has three tunes; there is no background music during the fights.\n\nThe Game Boy version has the same seven characters as the Super NES version, whereas the Game Gear version only has six characters (Shaq, Leotsu, Mephis, Rajah, Kaori, and Sett Ra). Both the Game Boy and Game Gear versions lack a tournament mode and in-game voices.\n\nBoth the Genesis and SNES versions of the game contained a hidden button sequence that would initiate a \"blood code\" in the spirit of Mortal Kombat. The blood effects were subdued and minor which kept the game at its \"MA-13\" (known by modern rating standard as \"T\") rating. However, the blood code gave access to finishing moves within the game that were triggered by striking the opponent in a certain way to end the match. The finishing moves were not gory as those depicted in the fatalities of \"Mortal Kombat\", but were considerably more violent when performed against monster-type characters in the game, rather than humans. Some of the finishing moves that have been discovered include the following examples:\n\n\"Shaq Fu\" received mixed reviews at the time of its release. \"GamePro\" gave the SNES version a positive review, saying that the unusually small size of the sprites is balanced off by the incredibly fast game speed. They also praised the \"ultra sharp\" controls and impressive digitized graphics. They reviewed the Genesis version as superior to the SNES version due to its additional characters and improved controls, and concluded that the game is \"fun once you get used to the small, fast sprites.\" One of the multiple reviewers at \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" scored it as a 6/10, and another gave it a 4/10. It received a grade of D from \"Entertainment Weekly\". \"GamesMaster\" gave the Genesis and SNES versions 81% and 83% respectively. \"Mean Machines Sega Magazine\" gave the Genesis version 79%.\n\nIn contrast to their reactions to the SNES and Genesis versions, \"GamePro\" panned the Game Boy release, saying it dumbs down the gameplay, loses so much graphical detail that the characters are unrecognizable, and makes the music far too pervasive.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Genesis version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"\"Shaq Fu\" includes everything a good fighting game needs, with the exception of good fighting.\"\n\nRetrospective criticism of the game has been generally negative. GameTrailers rated it number 4 Worst in their \"Top Ten Best and Worst Video Games\". In response to the negative feedback to the game, Levi Buchanan from IGN stated it was undeserved as a result of collective exaggerations. In the September 1997, \"Nintendo Power\" had 12 staff members vote in a list for the top 100 games of all time. This list also included a 10 worst games of all-time list voted by the staff, which placed \"Shaq Fu\" at 3rd worst place on their list. The article stated that it was \"not possible to come up with a worse idea than this.\"\n\nIn 1995, there were plans for Delphine Software to develop a sequel for the series, respectively titled \"Shaq Fu 2\", initially intended to be released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and Super Nintendo/Super Famicom sometime during Quarter IV of 1995 or Early 1996; the project was ultimately cancelled due to the mixed reception of the first entry, though in the years to follow, original concept art for five new characters (along with seven returning characters, those being Shaq, Rajah, Voodoo, Leotsu, Mephis, Kaori, and Sett Ra) and early stage designs that would've been a part of the game have surfaced online through the portfolio of one of the developers.\n\nIn March 2014, an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign was started for a sequel titled \"Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn\". The funding goal was $450,000 USD. If achieved, the game creators at Big Deez Productions promised that the game would be released for consoles (PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Wii U, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360). The campaign ended on May 5, 2014, with the funding goal exceeded at $473,884. Big Deez announced they will be accepting Quark crypto-currency as a method of in-game payment. \n\nAfter \"A Legend Reborn\" was successfully funded, there was little significant word on its developmental status and release timetable over the next few years. In late 2016, the sequel's developers reported on Indiegogo that its development was nearly finished, but declined to provide a concrete release date. Over a month after Nintendo launched the Nintendo Switch, a special trailer confirmed that \"A Legend Reborn\" will be available on that system. Saber Interactive also announced that it would offer free copies of the game to early adopters of \"NBA Playgrounds\" on the console as compensation for the initial lack of online features. In early 2018, it also confirmed that the game was delayed due to unexpected licensing issues that required some significant rework. The game was expected to come out in the second quarter of 2018, and the Wii U, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were cancelled. The sequel was released on June 5, 2018. \n\n\"A Legend Reborn\" features gameplay that heavily differs from its predecessor, more akin to a beat 'em up; despite the fact that it was commonly advertised and publicly claimed by developers, fans, news outlets, and even Shaq himself, to be a sequel, it is purely a reboot in its truest sense, taking place in a completely different continuity than the first entry (coined by some fans as the Reborn Universe, with both its predecessor and the cancelled \"Shaq Fu 2\" being in the Delphine Universe), and both the character dialogue and area aesthetics in the levels make plentiful references and inside jokes that call back to the first entry (such as Kaori's name showing up on a Traffic Ad Banner), as well as Shaq's career, Shaq Fu Radio, and even the development phase of \"A Legend Reborn\" itself, among plentiful others. It was met with mixed reception: While some critics noted its repetitive combat, unreliable controls and collision detection, as well as a lack of replay value for those who completed the main campaign, others praised its tongue-in-cheek humor and frantic action.\n\nOn June 29, 2018, a DLC add-on titled \"Barack Fu: The Adventures of Dirty Barry\" was revealed in two Launch Trailers that were shared by multiple gaming groups and news sites alike; it was also made available for free to those who had purchased a physical copy of \"A Legend Reborn\". \"Barack Fu\" continues the story of \"A Legend Reborn\", following the ending of Shaq's campaign, with the player now taking control of a fictionalized version of former United States President Barack Obama through two new stages (increasing the full level count of the game from six to eight) as he goes through France and Outer Space to defeat a fictional take on rapper/singer/songwriter Kanye West. Gameplay differences for Barack in this entry, when compared to Shaq, involve him having an ability set that delivers a far wider attack range (when using a Special) and his durability in battles is noticeably stronger, which makes for an easier survival rate when playing as him; at the time of \"Barack Fu\"'s initial release, players cannot choose to play through Shaq and Barack's individual campaigns as the other respective character, though the PC version of the game can have this be done through modding.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "473321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=473321", "title": "Spiral of silence", "text": "Spiral of silence\n\nThe spiral of silence theory is a political science and mass communication theory proposed by the German political scientist Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, which stipulates that individuals have a fear of isolation, which results from the idea that a social group or the society in general might isolate, neglect, or exclude members due to the members' opinions. This fear of isolation consequently leads to remaining silent instead of voicing opinions. Media is an important factor that relates to both the dominant idea and people's perception of the dominant idea. The assessment of one's social environment may not always correlate with reality.\n\nAccording to Shelly Neill, \"Introduced in 1974, the Spiral of Silence Theory [...] explores hypotheses to determine why some groups remain silent while others are more vocal in forums of public disclosure.\" The spiral of silence theory suggests that \"people who have believed that they hold a minority viewpoint on a public issue will remain in the background where their communication will be restrained; those who believe that they hold a majority viewpoint will be more encouraged to speak.\"\n\nThe theory explains the formation of social norms at both the micro and macro level. \"As a micro-theory, the spiral of silence examines opinion expression, controlling for people's predispositions – such as fear of isolation, and also demographic variables that have been shown to influence people's willingness to publicly express opinions on issues, such as agricultural biotechnology.\" The spiral of silence occurs on a macro level if more and more members of the perceived minority fall silent. This is when public perceptions of the opinion climate begin to shift. \"In other words, a person's individual reluctance to express his or her opinion, simply based on perceptions of what everyone else thinks, has important implications at the social level.\" As one opinion gains the interest of the majority, the minority faces threat and fear of isolation from society. As the opinion gains momentum by the majority, the minority continues to be threatened and falls deeper into their silence. It continues until the minority no longer speaks out against it, and the opinion of the perceived majority ultimately becomes a social norm.\n\nThe spiral model is an analogy used to visually describe the theory. The end of the spiral refers to the number of people who are not publicly expressing their opinions, due to the fear of isolation. An individual is more likely to go down the spiral if his or her opinion does not conform with the perceived majority opinion. The following steps summarize how the process works:\n\nThis is a process of formation, change and reinforcement of public opinion. The tendency of the one to speak up and the other to be silent starts off a spiraling process which increasingly establishes one opinion as the dominant one. Over time, these changing perceptions establish one opinion as predominant one and they change from the liquid state to a solid norm.\n\nFurther, Noelle-Neumann describes the spiral of silence as a dynamic process, in which predictions about public opinion become fact as mass media's coverage of the majority opinion becomes the status quo, and the minority becomes less likely to speak out.\n\nScholars have long argued over the concept of \"public\" within \"public opinion\". The use of \"public\" and \"the public\" betrays multiple competing meanings. There are three meanings of public. One meaning is the legal sense of public that focuses on openness. For example, a public place or path. A second meaning for the term emphasizes public rights. Lastly, within the phrase public opinion, public is said to have a related but different definition. Public, in this sense, could be characterized as social psychology. Scholars have marveled in amazement at the power public opinion has in making regulations, norms, and moral rules triumph over the individual self without ever troubling legislators, governments or courts for assistance.\n\n\"Common Opinion\" is what the Scottish social philosopher David Hume called it in his 1739 published work \"A Treatise of Human Nature\". Agreement and a sense of the common is what lay behind the English and French \"opinion.\" In researching the term opinion, \"meinung\" in German, researchers were led back to Plato's \"Republic\". In Plato's \"Republic\", a quote from Socrates conclude that opinion takes the middle position. Immanuel Kant considered opinion to be an \"insufficient judgement, subjectively as well as objectively.\" How valuable opinion may be was left out; however, the fact that it is suggested to be unified agreement of a population, or segment of the population, was still considered.\n\nThe term public opinion first emerged in France during the eighteenth century. The definition of public opinion has been debated over time. There has not been much progress in locking in one classification of the phrase \"public opinion.\" Hermann Oncken, a German historian, stated Whoever desires to grasp and define the concept of public opinion will recognize quickly that he is dealing with a Proteus, a being that appears simultaneously in a thousand guises, both visible and as a phantom, impotent and surprisingly efficacious, which presents itself in innumerable transformations and is forever slipping through our fingers just as we believe we have a firm grip on it... That which floats and flows cannot be understood by being locked up in a formula... After all, when asked, everyone knows exactly what public opinion means. It was said to be a \"fiction that belonged in a museum of the history of ideas; it could only be of historical interest.\"\n\nIn contradiction to that quote, the term public opinion seemed to not cease. During the early 1970s, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann was creating the theory of the spiral of silence. She was making an effort to clarify the 1965 finding of which voting intentions would not change but yet expectations that one side would win continued to increase. Noelle-Nuemann began to question if she was indeed grabbing a handle on what public opinion actually was. \"The spiral of silence might be one of the forms in which public opinion appeared; it might be a process through which a new, youthful public opinion develops or whereby the transformed meaning of an old opinion spreads.\"\n\nThe American sociologist Edward Ross described public opinion in 1898 using the word \"cheap\". \"The equation of 'public opinion' with 'ruling opinion' runs like a common thread through its many definitions. This speaks to the fact that something clinging to public opinion sets up conditions that move individuals to act, even against their own will.\"\n\nMany possible meanings and definitions of the term have been explored. Scholars have considered the content of public opinion, assumed to consist of public affairs issues. Scholars point out that the emergence of the public opinion depends on an open public discourse rather than \"on the discipline imposed by an apparent majority dominant enough to intimidate but whose views may or may not support actions that are in the common interest.\"\n\nThey have also considered whose opinion establishes public opinion, assumed to be persons of a community who are ready to express themselves responsibly about questions of public relevance. Scholars have also looked into the forms of public opinion, said to be those that are openly expressed and accessible; opinions that are made public, especially in the mass media. Controversy surrounding this term spiraled around both words combining to form the phrase.\n\nMass media's effects on both public opinion and the perception of the public opinion are central to the Spiral of Silence Theory. One of the earliest works that called attention to the relationship between media and the formation of public opinion was Walter Lippmann's book \"Public Opinion,\" published in 1923. Ideas of Lippmann regarding the effects of media influenced the emergence of the Spiral of Silence Theory. As she is building the spiral theory, Noelle-Neumann states \"the reader can only complete and explain the world by making use of a consciousness which in large measure has been created by the mass media.\"\n\nAgenda-setting theory is another work that Noelle-Neumann builds on as she is characterizing media's effect on the public opinion. Agenda-setting theory describes the relationship between media and public opinion by asserting that the public importance of an issue depends on its salience in the media. Along with setting the agenda, the media further determines the salient issues through a constant battle with other events attempting to gain place in the agenda. The media battles with these news alternatives by creating \"pseudo-crises\" and \"pseudo-novelties.\"\n\nMedia's characteristics as a communication tool further affect people's perception of their own ideas in regard to the public opinion. According to Noelle-Neumann, the media is a \"one-sided, indirect, public form of communication, contrasting threefold with the most natural form of human communication, the conversation.\" These characteristics of the media in particular further overwhelm one's individual ideas.\n\nWhile some media communication theories assume a passive audience, such as the Hypodermic Needle model, the spiral model assumes an active audience \"who consumes media products in the context of their personal and social goals.\" Knowledge \"gained from the mass media may offer ammunition for people to express their opinions and offer a rationale for their own stance.\" Ho et al. point out that \"among individuals who paid high amount of media attention, those who have a low fear of isolation were significantly more likely to offer a rationale for their own opinion than were those who have a high fear of isolation.\"\n\nNoelle-Neuman regards media central to the formulation of the Spiral of Silence Theory, whereas some scholars argue whether the dominant idea in one's social environment overwhelms the dominant idea that media proposes as the perceived social norm. Some empirical research align with this perspective; suggesting that the \"micro-climate\" of an individual overwhelms the effects of the media. Other articles further suggest that talking with others is the primary way of understanding the opinion climate.\n\nThe fear of isolation is the centrifugal force that accelerates the spiral of silence. Essentially, people fear becoming social isolates and thus take measures to avoid such a consequence, as demonstrated by psychologist Solomon Asch in the Asch conformity experiments. People feel more comfortable by agreeing with opinions that they know are wrong instead of telling others their ideas.\n\nThis assumption proposes that in order to avoid becoming isolated and in order not to lose popularity and esteem, people constantly observe their environment very closely. They try to find out which opinions and modes of behaviour are prevalent, and which opinions and modes of behaviour are becoming more popular. They behave and express themselves accordingly in public. Then, they try to determine whether they are in the majority: whether the public opinion tends to agree with them. If they feel they are in the minority, they tend to remain silent.\n\nIndividuals use what is described as \"an innate ability\" or quasi-statistical sense to gauge public opinion. People assume they can sense and figure out what others are thinking.\nPluralistic ignorance may occur in some cases, leading to the minority opinion to be accepted as a norm. Group members may be privately rejecting a norm, but may falsely assume that other group members accept it. This phenomenon may cause a group to hold on to a norm.\n\nOur evaluation of a public opinion has an effect on our decision to speak up. Where opinions are relatively definite and static – customs, for example – one has to express or act according to this opinion in public or run the risk of becoming isolated. In contrast, where opinions are in flux, or disputed, the individual will try to find out which opinion he can express without becoming isolated. Individuals tend to publicly express their opinions and attitudes when they perceive their view to be dominant or on the rise. Conversely, when individuals perceive that their opinion is less popular or losing popularity, they are less likely to voice it in public. What one individual decides to do affects all of society around them.\n\nThe theory explains a \"vocal minority\" (the complement of the \"silent majority\") by stating that people who are highly educated, or who have greater affluence, and the few other cavalier individuals who do not fear isolation, are likely to speak out regardless of public opinion. It further states that this minority is a necessary factor of change while the compliant majority is a necessary factor of stability, with both being a product of evolution. There is a vocal minority, which remains at the top of the spiral in defiance of threats of isolation.\n\nThis theory calls these vocal minorities the hardcore nonconformist or the avant-garde. Hardcore nonconformists are \"people who have already been rejected for their beliefs and have nothing to lose by speaking out.\" The hardcore has the ability to reconfigure majority opinion. While the avant-garde are \"the intellectuals, artists, and reformers in the isolated minority who speak out because they are convinced they are ahead of the times.\"\n\nThe spiral of silence has brought insight regarding diverse topics, ranging from speaking about popular culture phenomena, to smoking. Considering that the spiral of silence is more likely to occur in controversial issues and issues with a moral component, many scholars have applied the theory to controversial topics, such as abortion, affirmative action, and capital punishment.\n\nExisting literature prior to the spiral of silence theory suggest a relationship between social conformity and culture, motivating communication scholars to conduct cross-cultural analysis of the theory. Scholars in the field of psychology in particular previously addressed the cultural variance involved in the conformity to the majority opinion. More recent studies confirm the link between conformity and culture: a meta-analysis regarding Asch conformity experiments, for example, suggest that collectivist cultures are more likely to exhibit conformity than the individualistic cultures.\n\n\"A Cross Cultural Test of the Spiral of Silence\" by Huiping Huang analyzes the results of a telephone survey done in Taiwan and the United States. The hypotheses tested were the beliefs that the United States is an \"individualistic\" society, while Taiwan is a \"collectivist\" society. This suggested that the spiral of silence is less likely to be activated in the United States, because individuals are more likely to put emphasis on their personal goals. They put the \"I\" identity over the \"we\" identity, and strive for personal success. Therefore, it was hypothesized that they would be more likely to speak out, regardless of if they are in the minority. On the other hand, it was predicted that individuals in Taiwan put more emphasis on the collective goal, so they would conform to the majority influence in hopes of avoiding tension and conflict. The study also tested the effect of motives, including self-efficacy and self-assurance.\n\nTelephone surveys were conducted; the citizens of the United States were questioned in regards to American involvement in Somalia, and the citizens of Taiwan about the possibility of a direct presidential election. Both issues focused on politics and human rights, and were therefore comparable. Respondents were asked to choose \"favor,\" \"neutral\" or \"oppose\" in regards to the categories of themselves, family and friends, the media, society, and society in the future about the given issue. Measurements were also taken regarding the individualism and collectivism constructs, and the \"motives of not expressing opinion\" based on a 1–10 and 1–5 scale respectively, in approval of given statements.\n\nResults showed support for the original hypothesis. Overall, Americans were more likely to speak out than Taiwanese. Being incongruous with the majority lessened the motivation of the Taiwanese to speak out (and they had a higher collectivist score), but had little effect on the Americans. In Taiwan, future support and belief of society played a large role in likeliness to voice an opinion, and support that the activation of the spiral of silence is in effect. In the United States, it was hypothesized that because they were more individualistic, they would be more likely to speak out if in the minority, or incongruous group. However, this was not true, but Huang suggests that perhaps the issue chosen was not directly prevalent, and therefore, they found it \"unnecessary to voice their objections to the majority opinion.\" Lack of self-efficacy led to lack of speaking out in both countries.\n\n\"Basque Nationalism and the Spiral of Silence\" is an article by Spencer and Croucher that analyzes the public perception of ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, a militant separatist group) in Spain and France. This study was conducted in a similar way as above, with Basque individuals from Spain and France being questioned about their support of ETA. They were asked questions such as \"How likely would you be to enter into a conversation with a stranger on a train about ETA?\" Taken into consideration were the cultural differences of the two different regions in which ETA existed.\n\nThe results supported the theory of the spiral of silence. While there was a highly unfavorable opinion of the group, there was a lack of an outcry to stop it. Individuals claimed that they were more likely to voice their opinions to non-Basques, suggesting that they have a \"fear of isolation\" in regards to fellow Basques. Furthermore, the Spanish individuals questioned were more likely to be silent because of their greater proximity to the violent acts.\n\nOne study, by Henson and Denker \"investigates perceptions of silencing behaviors, political affiliation, and political differences as correlates to perceptions of university classroom climates and communication behaviors.\" They looked at whether students' view of the classroom changes whether they perceive the instructor and other classmates with a different political affiliation, with the instructor and other classmates communicating using silencing behaviors. The article stated that little has been investigated into student-teacher interactions in the classroom, and how the students are influenced. The goal of the article was to \"determine how political ideas are expressed in the university classrooms, and thus, assess the influence of classroom communication on the perceptions of political tolerance.\"\n\nThe article claimed that university classrooms are an adequate place to scrutinize the spiral of silence theory because it is a place that has interpersonal, cultural, media, and political communication. Henson and Denker said, \"Because classroom interactions and societal discourse are mutually influential, instructors and students bring their own biases and cultural perspectives into the classroom.\"\n\nThe study researched whether there was a correlation between students' perception that they were being politically silenced and their perceived differences in student-instructor political affiliation. The study also questioned whether there was any connection between the perceived climate and the similarity of the student and instructor on their political affiliations. The researchers used participants from a Midwestern university's communication courses. The students answered a survey over their perceptions of political silencing, classroom climate, and the climate created by the instructor. The results of this research found that there is a positive relationship of the perceived similarities in political party and ideological differences of the student and instructor to perceived greater political silencing.\n\nWhile the studies regarding the spiral of silence theory focused on face-to-face interaction before 2000, the theory was later applied to a computer-mediated communication environment. The first study in this context analyzed communication behaviors in online chat rooms regarding the issue of abortion, and revealed that minority opinion holders were more likely to speak out, whereas their comments remained neutral. Another study focused on the Korean bulletin board postings regarding the national election, and found a relationship between online postings and the presentation of candidates in the mainstream media. The third study focuses on the online review system, suggesting that the fear of isolation tend to reduce the willingness of members to voice neutral and negative reviews. The Spiral of Silence Theory is extended \"into the context of non-anonymous multichannel communication platforms\" and \"the need to consider the role of communicative affordances in online opinion expression\" is also addressed.\n\nCurrent literature suggests that the spiral model can be applied to the social media context. Gearhart and Zhang conduct a study to examine whether or not the use of social media will increase people's motivation to express their opinions about political issues. The results suggest that social media users \"who have received a strong negative reaction to their politically related posts are likely to censor themselves, exemplifying the spiral of silence effect\". Another research confirms the positive relationship between speaking out and issue importance on the social media context as well: individuals who view gay bullying as a significant social issue are more likely to comment on Facebook.\n\nThe spiral of silence theory can be also applied to social capital context. Recent studies see social capital as \"a variable that enables citizens to develop norms of trust and reciprocity, which are necessary for successful engagement in collective activities\". One study examines three individual-level indicators of social capital--civic engagement, trust and neighborliness, and the relationship between these indicators and people's willingness to express their opinions and their perception of support for one's opinions. The results suggest that civic engagement has a direct effect on people's willingness to express their opinions and neighborliness and trust had direct positive effects on people's perception of support for one's opinions. Also, the study shows that \"only a direct (but not indirect) effect of civic engagement on opinion expression further highlights a potential difference between bonding and bridging social capital\".\n\nThe concept of isolation has a variety of definitions, dependent upon the circumstances it is investigated in. In one instance the problem of isolation has been defined as social withdrawal, defined as low relative frequencies of peer interaction. Other researchers have defined isolation as low levels of peer acceptance or high levels of peer rejection. Research that considers isolation with regard to the Internet either focuses on how the Internet makes individuals more isolated from society by cutting off their contact from live human beings or how the Internet decreases social isolation of people by allowing them to expand their social networks and giving them more means to stay in touch with friends and family. Since the development of the Internet, and in particular the World Wide Web, a wide variety of groups have come into existence, including Web and Internet Relay Chat (IRC), newsgroups, multiuser dimensions (MUDs), and, more recently, commercial virtual communities. The theories and hypotheses about how Internet-based groups impact individuals are numerous and wide-ranging. Some researchers view these fast growing virtual chat cliques, online games, or computer-based marketplaces as a new opportunity, particularly for stigmatized people, to take a more active part in social life.\n\nTraditionally, social isolation has been represented as a one-dimensional construct organized around the notion of a person's position outside the peer group and refers to isolation from the group as a result of being excluded from the group by peers. From children to adults, literature shows that people understand the concept of isolation and fear the repercussions of being isolated from groups of which they are a member. Fearing isolation, people did not feel free to speak up if they feel they hold dissenting views, which means people restrict themselves to having conversation with like-minded individuals, or have no conversation whatsoever. Witschge further explained, \"Whether it is fear of harming others, or fear to get harmed oneself, there are factors that inhibit people from speaking freely, and which thus results in a non-ideal type of discussion, as it hinders diversity and equality of participants and viewpoints to arise fully.\"\n\nThe medium of the Internet has the power to free people from the fear of social isolation, and in doing so, shuts down the spiral of silence. The Internet allows people to find a place where they can find groups of people with like mindsets and similar points of view. Van Alstyne and Brynjolfsson stated that \"Internet users can seek out interactions with like-minded individuals who have similar values, and thus become less likely to trust important decisions to people whose values differ from their own.\" The features of the Internet could not only bring about more people to deliberate by freeing people of psychological barriers, but also bring new possibilities in that it \"makes manageable large-scale, many-to-many discussion and deliberation.\" Unlike traditional media that limit participation, the Internet brings the characteristics of empowerment, enormous scales of available information, specific audiences can be targeted effectively and people can be brought together through the medium.\n\nThe Internet is a place where many reference and social groups are available with similar views. It has become a place where it appears that people have less of a fear of isolation. One research article examined individuals' willingness to speak their opinion online and offline. Through survey results, from 305 participants, a comparison and contrast of online and offline spiral of silence behaviors was determined. Liu and Fahmy stated that \"it is easy to quit from an online discussion without the pressure of complying with the majority group.\" This is not to say that a spiral of silence does not occur in an online environment. People are still less likely to speak out, even in an online setting, when there is a dominant opinion that differs from their own. But people in the online environment will speak up if someone has a reference group that speaks up for them. In an online situation, just having one person be there to encourage a minority point of view can put an end to a spiral of silence. Another reason for why the spiral of silence theory has less of an effect online could be that studies do not acknowledge whether the person is more likely to speak out against dominant views offline as well. The person might have characteristics that make him comfortable speaking out against dominant views offline, which make them just as comfortable speaking out in an online setting. Even though research suggests that there is a chance people will speak out with their opinions more often in an online setting, silencing of views can still occur. Another research article examined the influence of different opinion climates in online forums (opinion congruence with the majority of forum participants vs. website source) and found personal opinion congruence was more influential than the online site in which the forum is situated in. Gonzenbach and Nekmat said it might be worth researching whether the factors in these studies or other factors cause people to be more comfortable when it comes to speaking their mind while online.\n\nThe nature of the Internet facilitates not only the participation of more people, but also a more heterogeneous group of people. Page stated, \"The onward rush of electronic communications technology will presumably increase the diversity of available ideas and the speed and ease with which they fly about and compete with each other.\" The reason people engage in deliberations is because of their differences, and the Internet allows differences to be easily found. The Internet seems the perfect place to find different views of a very diverse group of people who are at the same time open to such difference and disagreement needed for deliberation. Noelle-Neumann's initial idea of cowering and muted citizens is difficult to reconcile with empirical studies documenting uninhibited discussion in computer-mediated contexts such as chat rooms and newsgroups.\n\nThe Internet provides an anonymous setting, and it can be argued that in an anonymous setting, fears of isolation and humiliation would be reduced. Wallace recognized that when people believe their actions cannot be attributed to them personally, they tend to become less inhibited by social conventions and restraints. This can be very positive, particularly when people are offered the opportunity to discuss difficult personal issues under conditions in which they feel safer.\n\nThe groups' ability to taunt an individual is lessened on the Internet, thus reducing the tendency to conform. Wallace goes on to summarize a number of empirical studies that do find that dissenters feel more liberated to express their views online than offline, which might result from the fact that the person in the minority would not have to endure taunts or ridicule from people that are making up the majority, or be made to feel uncomfortable for having a different opinion. Stromer-Galley considered that \"an absence of non-verbal cues, which leads to a lowered sense of social presence, and a heightened sense of anonymity\" frees people from the psychological barriers that keep them from engaging in a face-to-face deliberation.\n\nThe crux of the spiral of silence is that people believe consciously or subconsciously that the expression of unpopular opinions will lead to negative repercussions. These beliefs may not exist on the Internet for several reasons. First, embarrassment and humiliation depends on the physical presence of others. In computer-mediated communication, physical isolation often already exists and poses no further threat. Second, a great deal of normative influence is communicated through nonverbal cues, such as eye contact and gestures, but computer-mediated communication typically precludes many of these cues. Third, Keisler, Siegel, and McQuire observe that nonverbal social context cues convey formality and status inequality in face-to-face communication. When these cues are removed, the importance of social status as a source of influence recedes. Group hierarchies that develop in face-to-face interaction emerge less clearly in a mediated environment. The form and consequences of conformity influence should undergo significant changes given the interposition of a medium that reduces the social presence of participants. Social presence is defined as the degree of salience of the other person in the interaction or the degree to which the medium conveys some of the person's presence.\n\nAn important issue in obtaining heterogeneity in conversation is equal access for all the participants and equal opportunities to influence in the discussion. When people believe they are ignorant about a topic, incapable to participate in a discussion or not equal to their peers, they tend to not even become involved in a deliberation. When people do decide to participate, their participation might be overruled by dominant others, or their contribution might be valued less or more, depending on their status. Dahlberg praises the Internet for its possibility to liberate people from the social hierarchies and power relations that exist offline: \"The 'blindness' of cyberspace to bodily identity... [is supposed to allow] people to interact as if they were equals. Arguments are said to be assessed by the value of the claims themselves and not the social position of the poster\".\n\nGastil sees this feature as one of the strongest points of the Internet: \"if computer-mediated interaction can consistently reduce the independent influence of status, it will have a powerful advantage over face-to-face deliberation\". While status cues are difficult to detect, perceptions about the status converge, and this lessens stereotyping and prejudice.\n\nIt may be that people do feel more equal in online forums than they feel offline. Racism, ageism, and other kinds of discrimination against out groups \"seems to be diminishing because the cues to out-group status are not as obvious\". Next to this, the Internet has rapidly and dramatically increased the capacities to develop, share and organize information, realizing more equality of access to information.\n\nThe relationship between the perception of public opinion and willingness to speak-up is mainly measured through surveys In surveys, respondents are often asked whether they would reveal their opinions given a hypothetical situation, right after their opinions about the public opinion and their opinion is received. Whether asking hypothetical questions can reflect real life cases was questioned by some communication scholars, leading to a criticism of this methodology as not being able to capture what the respondent would do in a real-life situation. A research study addressed this criticism by comparatively testing a spiral model both in a hypothetical survey and in a focus group. The findings are in line with the critic of hypothetical survey questions, demonstrating a significant increase in the spiral of silence in focus groups.\n\nAmong different approaches to survey methodology, cross-sectional study design is the leading method employed to analyze and test the theory. Cross-sectional design involves the analysis of the relationship between public opinion and willingness to speak at one point in time.\n\nWhile many of the researchers employ cross-sectional design, some scholars employed panel data. Under this methodology, three specific approaches have been used. Noelle-Neumann herself tested the theory from the aggregate level. Using this approach, the change process is \"observed by comparing the absolute share of people perceiving a majority climate with people willing to express their views over time.\" The second approach that has been used in Spiral of Silence research is conducting separate regressions for each panel survey wave. The drawback for this approach is that the individual change of climate and opinions perception is ignored. The last approach a few scholars used in conducting Spiral of Silence researches is to use changed scores as dependent variables. However, as intuitive as this approach may be, it \"leads to well-documented difficulties with respect to statistical properties, such as regression to the mean or the negative correlation of the change score with the time one state\".\n\nThe critics of this theory most often claim that individuals have different influences that affect whether they speak out or not.\n\nResearch indicates that people fear isolation in their small social circles more than they do in the population at large. Within a large nation, one can always find a group of people who share one's opinions, however people fear isolation from their close family and friends more in theory. Research has demonstrated that this fear of isolation is stronger than the fear of being isolated from the entire public, as it is typically measured.\n\nScholars have also argued that both personal characteristics and various culture among different groups will have influences on whether a person will willingly speak out. If one person \"has a positive self-concept and lacks a sense of shame, that person will speak out regardless of how she or he perceives the climate of public opinion.\" Another influence critics give for people choosing not to speak out against public opinion is culture. Open expression of ideas is forbidden in some of the cultures. Some cultures are more individualistic, which would support more of an individual's own opinion, while collectivist cultures support the overall group's opinion and needs. Gender can be also considered as a cultural factor. In some cultures, women's \"perception of language, not public opinion, forces them to remain quiet.\" Scheufele & Moy, further assert that certain conflict styles and cultural indicators should be used to understand these differences.\n\nAnother criticism of the spiral of silence research is that the research designs do not observe the movement in the spiral over time. Critics propose that Noelle-Neumann's emphasis on time in the formation of the spiral should reflect on the methodology as well, and the dynamic nature of the spiral model should be acknowledged. They argue that the spiral of silence theory involves a \"time factor\", considering that the changes in public opinion eventually lead to change in people's assessments of the public opinion. Also, according to Spilchal, the spiral of silence theory \"ignores the evidence of the historical development of public opinion, both in theory and practice, through the extension of suffrage, organisation of political propaganda groups, the establishment of pressure groups and political parties, the eligibility of ever wider circles of public officials and, eventually, the installation of several forms of direct democracy.\"\n\nSome scholars also provide understandings of the theory in the contemporary society by pointing out that \"it is not so much the actual statistical majority that generates pressure for conformity as it is the climate of opinion conveyed in large measure by the media.\" Under the great influence by the media coverage, the climate of opinion \"is not invariably an accurate reflection of the distribution of opinions within the polity.\"\n\nFurther, Scheufele & Moy find problems in the operationalization of key terms, including willingness to speak out. This construct should be measured in terms of actually speaking out, not voting or other conceptually similar constructs. Conformity experiments have no moral component, yet morality is a key construct in the model. These conformity experiments, particularly those by Asch, form part of the base of the theory. Scholars question whether these conformity experiments are relevant to the development of the Spiral of Silence.\n\nResearch indicates that while the existence of groups with other opinions than those that are supposed to be dominant in a society opens a possibility for some people to express some different opinions, fallacy assumptions in such groups that criticism of particular aspects of that group's program is support for society's mainstream views is a source of false dilemmas. This research indicates that such false dilemmas, especially when there are inconsistencies both in mainstream views and in organized opposition views, causes a spiral of silence that specifically silences logically consistent third, fourth or higher number viewpoint criticism. The research in question does not find a solution in many approaches of \"recognizing cognitive bias\" but instead indicate that such assumptions are part of the problem by promoting the myth of one's own group having overcome its bias by institutional means and allegations of rational critical arguments being due to bias in the minds of critics, citing evolutionary research that shows that not only would any predisposition for justification of views be selected against due to costing nutrients without improving adaptivity of behavior, but that the claim that most adult humans are irrational due to missing stimulation of rationality in early childhood is also evolutionarily indefensible as genes for potential rationality would have been totally eliminated by selection before reaching significant population fraction if they needed a society already promoting rationality to manifest themselves adaptively. The research indicates that humans are not inherently irrational but are forced to pretend irrationality by false dilemmas that claim rational criticism to be justifications for irrational resentment, and suggest that openly expressed rationality can be promoted by discussions in which no exclusion based on traditional political scales or beneficiary classifications exist but all allegations of irrational motives as well as assumptions that some opinions are linked or that criticism of one view is defence of another specific view are excluded.\n\n"}
{"id": "26420759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26420759", "title": "Srugim", "text": "Srugim\n\nSrugim (; literally, \"knitted\" or \"crocheted\") is an Israeli television drama which originally aired on Yes TV between 2008 and 2012. It was directed by Eliezer \"Laizy\" Shapiro, who co-created it with Havvah Deevon. The series depicted the lives of five national religious single men and women, in their 30s, who reside in Jerusalem. The title is a reference to the crocheted skullcaps worn by men of that denomination. \"Srugim\", which dealt with controversial issues in the Religious Zionist society in Israel, caused a public uproar within that sector.\n\nIt enjoyed high ratings, from both the religious and non-religious sects in Israel, as well as with American Jews. Many of the American Jews compared the issues of the characters in the show to those of the Upper West Side. The show won five Israeli Academy of Film and Television Awards.\n\nIn 2012 it was announced that the show would not be picked up for a fourth season.\n\nYifat and Hodaya, who went to an all-girls school together, now share an apartment in Katamon, the hub of religious singles' social life in Jerusalem. Yifat meets Nati, a childhood friend who is now a successful doctor, and he introduces the two women to his roommate, Amir, a recently divorced teacher. Reut, a high-earning accountant who is also a religious feminist, joins their small band. The five are all Religious Zionist, unmarried, and in their late twenties or early thirties; they must cope with a society that expects people to get married while young.\n\nYifat falls for Nati, who seems oblivious. When she confesses her feelings, he admits he knew it all along but does not reciprocate. Hodaya, who is becoming less pious, meets Avri, a secular archaeologist, and they date. Amir must deal with the stigma of being divorced, which hampers his chances to enter a new relationship; when he encounters his divorcée, Na'ama, their mutual loneliness leads them to have sex. They must divorce again in a Rabbinical court. Reut wants to cantillate the haftara, and she convinces the initially reluctant Yochai to teach her. Though rejecting the notion of a woman chanting at first, he soon becomes enamored with her. When he cannot control himself and kisses Reut, he immediately proposes marriage. Unsure, she decides to keep dating him and sees another man simultaneously. Hodaya profanes the Sabbath for the first time in her life and then lets Avri drive her to the beach, where she tells him the truth.\n\nReut begins to lose interest in Yochai. Although intending to consummate her relationship with Avri, Hodaya flinches at the last moment, and she decides to end their romance, stating that the differences between them are too great. Tired of Jerusalem, Yifat moves to a quiet settlement. Amir begins visiting Yifat, and the two become close friends. Nati tries to approach her again, angering Amir. The two come to blows, but eventually they reconcile. Amir and Yifat decide to marry. After meeting up with her niece, who was evicted from Gaza and who consequently lost her faith, Hodaya resolves to disaffiliate. Reut breaks up with Yochai and goes on a long trip to India.\n\nSeason 2 began approximately six months after the conclusion of season 1. Amir and Yifat get married, and now must cope with the new hardships, including fertility problems and the need to observe ritual purity. Amir returns to his roots and begins praying in a Tunisian synagogue with an old man named Shmuel. He is frowned upon by his Ashkenazi environment. Nati's mother dies, and his brother Roi moves in with him. Reut returns from India after six months, after missing Amir and Yifat's wedding, as well as her sister Elisheva's wedding, who is now pregnant. Reut begins to date Roi, only to have Roi later reveal that he is a homosexual, to Nati's surprise. Reut refuses to give up on them and continues to date him, however Roi eventually ends things. Nati falls in love with Dafna, a divorced mother who works in his hospital as a medical clown, though he leaves her after realizing he cannot cope with raising her son. Hodaya, trying to lead a secular lifestyle, works in a pub and meets Assaf, another formerly religious man, with whom she loses her virginity. She breaks with him after discovering that he began practicing again.\n\nYifat finally becomes pregnant. Roi has turned ultra-orthodox and has an arranged marriage. Amir quits his job as a teacher, finds a new one as Reut's secretary and finally receives a lifelong tuition to study in a seminary. Nati has a new roommate, a poet named Azaria, who was abandoned by his fiancée, Tehila. Nati falls in love with Tehila but cannot convince her to see him for she vowed to remain single until Azaria finds a new partner. Nati encourages Reut to date Azaria, who begins to exploit her for her money. After becoming drunk, he confesses that he does not love her and she abandons him. Tehila starts seeing Nati; he is finally ready to commit and proposes to her, and she seems to accept. Hodaya encounters Avri again. He cancels his own planned wedding and asks her to marry him instead. Hodaya backs off once more, just a few days before the ceremony, leaving him heartbroken. Amir becomes friends with a boy at his yeshiva and goes to work in a ranch in the Negev with him for a few weeks. Hodaya receives a radio show of her own, becomes stressed and quits. Yifat admonishes her for her constant wavering. Tehila speaks with Azaria, and informs Nati they decided to resume their relationship. Nati sinks into depression. Yifat delivers her baby prematurely; Reut and Hodaya stay with her while Nati drives off to fetch Amir. He must stay in the empty ranch while Amir drives back to Jerusalem. Reut comes to bring him back, and they both reconcile while staying in the desert. Hodaya, who heeded Yifat's words, gets her job back and reunites with Avri. Amir and Yifat prepare to take their newborn son home.\n\n\nLaizy Shapiro and Havvaah Deevon became acquainted while studying in the Ma'ale School of Television, Film and the Arts. In 2005, the Gesher Multicultural Film Fund announced its intention to create a picture about religious-secular relations and held a contest for a script. Shapiro and Deevon submitted a treatment for a romantic comedy about a relationship between a bachelor living in Ramat Gan and a young settler from Hebron. Shapiro told her he had a similar idea already in his second year in Ma'ale, in 2000. Their entry was rejected, but they met Jonathan Aroch, a veteran producer, who served as their mentor during the competition. Aroch suggested they write another outline. Their second script concerned a religious single from Jerusalem named Nati, who is frustrated with dating and has resolved to give it only another year and then marry the first woman he encounters. This second entry was also declined. Shapiro and Divon returned to their regular jobs.\n\nA year later, Aroch contacted both again, suggesting they make a television series about the religious singles scene in Jerusalem, the so-called \"Katamon swamp\" or \"marsh\". A real sociological phenomenon, the \"swamp\" is a large concentration of middle-class Religious Zionist men and women who remain unmarried at a relatively advanced age, a trend causing much strain in their society. Divon and Shapiro created a basic outline for a show, and conceived of the five main characters. They planned to name the series, \"Kovshei Katamon\" (\"Conquerors of Katamon\"), which is the name of one of the area's main streets and a reference to the neighborhood's \"conquest\" by members of the \"swamp\". The studios refused to accept the title. On 20 July 2006, Ma'ariv first reported about contacts between Aroch and the television companies of Keshet and Yes, concerning the future purchase of the series, labeled under the working title \"Sex v'ha'Ir haQdosha\" (\"Sex and the Holy City\"). It was reported that due to the high production costs expected, the companies considered broadcasting it first on satellite and later on terrestrial television, to ensure maximal revenues.\n\nAfter Yes bought the rights, Aroch hired a group of screenwriters, many of them Ma'ale alumni and residents of the \"swamp\" themselves. Divon, Shapiro and their team wrote a full screenplay for a first season of fifteen episodes. Shapiro was also chosen to direct it. Auditions were held in September and October 2007. Towards the end of the second month, Aroch himself selected the final name of the show, \"Srugim\" – alluding to the crocheted skullcaps worn by national religious men, which distinguish them from other sectors. Principal photography was held in the winter of 2008. All studio filming was carried out in Tel-Aviv, but external photography occurred in Jerusalem and in Nofei Prat, which served as the fictional settlement to which Yifat moves.\n\nThe second season was shot in the summer of 2009. Principal photography for the third season began on 21 February 2010. In early May 2012, though the last season was considered the most successful so far, Shapiro and Divon announced they would not produce a fourth one, and the show was terminated.\n\nIn February 2010, the series began to air on The Jewish Channel in the United States.\n\nAs of 2017, all of the series is available on Amazon Prime.\n\n\"Source:\"\n\nJeffrey Woolf, a Bar-Ilan University expert on Orthodox Jewish portrayals in the media, explains why this series has become popular not only with the secular \"TV-watching\" community, but also with many members of modern orthodoxy:\n\nIt's really the first time that the religious-Zionist community has been represented in a non-stereotyped way on television... Religious characters are usually cartoon-like in their superficiality, either because of malice or because of ignorance...\n\nHe claims that the show is important for both the religious and secular elements, because while many of the modern orthodox viewers can finally see characters with whom they identify, it offers secular viewers access to \"an entire [religious] world that is normally inaccessible”.\n\nA number of writers note that the phenomenon of a growing number of Jewish singles in the religious community is one factor in the show's popularity, because it is unprecedented in Jewish history, where marriages between religiously observant men and women traditionally occurred while both partners were young. Many reasons contribute to this change, including the financial ability of women to live on their own, rather than under the \"protection\" of their husband, but whatever the reasons, this change has created many new questions and challenges in their lives.\n\nYair Rosenberg writes in the \"Jewish Review of Books\" that the program has become an \"Israeli pop culture phenomenon.\" However, while he agrees that the show has become extremely popular among members of both the religious and non-religious communities, there have been some detractors, including Rabbi Shlomo Aviner:\n\nOne prominent Religious Zionist rabbi went so far as to place the show under a religious ban, citing the questionable conduct of various dati characters on the show. \"There is bad language and licentiousness. It is not enough to be \"shomer negiah\" [to observe the prohibition against touching someone of the opposite sex], and this is also not always followed [on the show]—one needs purity and modesty,\" he wrote.\n\n\"The Jewish Week\" wrote that the show \"is attracting a growing audience here in the States,\" and it is being discussed in many forums, including Facebook.\n\n"}

Despite the name, the stream of unconsciousness occurs more in the form of waves than an actual continuous running stream of dialogue. The stream of unconsciousness is one of several forms of dramatic monologue, where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person. Such monologues are commonly used in poetry and drama, but with the stream of unconsciousness, the audience or third persons are 'unknowingly' imaginary. It is primarily a fictional device and often takes the form of a tragedy. The term was introduced to the field of literary studies from that of the independent music industry, where it was redefined by author and artist Bryan Lewis Saunders in 2005. For nearly a century the term has been both a misnomer and a malapropism for the stream of consciousness.\n\nThe audio recordings of Dion McGregor (1922–1994) can be perceived as one of the precursors of the 'stream of unconsciousness' (narrative mode), although his monlogues and somniloquy were never transcribed and presented as such. \"Dreams\" (1995) by contemporary American artist Jim Shaw is a collection of illustrations and extremely detailed dream descriptions. \"Experiment with Dreams\" by Leif Elggren and Thomas Liljenberg (Stockholm Feb. 1996) may also be attributed to the formation of this method.\n\nExamples of notable works employing the stream of unconsciousness narrative mode are:\n\n"}

She is a cultural activist and an entrepreneur.\n\nHadjitofi, also known as \"Icon Hunter\", began her work repatriating stolen artifacts in the early 1980s and is best known for orchestrating the “Munich Case”, one of the largest art trafficking sting operations in European history. Her efforts led to the arrest of the Turkish art smuggler Aydin Dikmen and the confiscation of over $60 million' worth of looted artifacts from Cyprus and around the world.\n\nIt began when as Honorary Consul to Cyprus (a non-paid position), she was approached by Michel van Rijn, an art dealer turned informant, wishing to exchange information about stolen Cypriot treasures in return for payment. Tasoula spent the next ten years of her life tracking down information and leads from both Van Rijn and her own research, culminating in the planning and execution of the Munich Case.\n\nIn 1999, at the height of her accomplishment, Hadjitofi was removed from office because her contribution to her country was overshadowing the paid diplomats and civil servants. Fifteen years later, due to mismanagement, the case remained in the courts. In addition to this, Aydin Dikmen, sued the Church of Cyprus for ownership of the stolen treasures that he was convicted of stealing from Cyprus and the stolen artifacts remain in the possession of the German Police. Meanwhile, the people of Cyprus had no access to their cultural heritage, until the most recent Court of Appeal of the Court of Munich. The court decision of the 18th of March 2013 made it possible for the remaining Cypriot artifacts to return to Cyprus, as they are now indisputably Cypriot.\n\nThese experiences led Tasoula Hadjitofi to create “Walk Of Truth”, a non-governmental organization with the mission of combating art trafficking by creating reforms to protect cultural heritage in conflict areas.\n\nTasoula Hadjitofi was born and raised in Famagusta Cyprus. In 1974, she and her family were forced to flee their home due to the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus and the outbreak of the war. She went on to become a successful entrepreneur, founding Octagon Professionals International, a company specializing in the provision of IT services and professional manpower to clients throughout Europe and Asia. She was the first woman (and youngest person at the age of 27) to be appointed Honorary Consul to Cyprus in her adopted country of the Netherlands. She served as Representative of the Church of Cyprus where she sought justice for the looting of Cyprus' cultural heritage through repatriation of its stolen religious artifacts. Her work with Archbishop Chrysostomos I culminated in the orchestrating the Munich Operation, which led to the arrest of art trafficker Aydin Dikmen and the recovery of over $60 million of stolen antiquities from Cyprus and around the world.\n\nTasoula Hadjitofi is married to Dr. Michael Hadjitofi and is a mother to son Andreas and daughters Sophia and Marina.\n\nMrs. Hadjitofi’s non-governmental organization, \"Walk of Truth\", engages the public about the importance of protecting global heritage. Walk of Truth organizes debates about art trafficking and restitution and rallies governments, political leaders legislatures, law enforcement, museums and cultural organizations for global unity in combatting art trafficking and protecting cultural heritage in areas of conflict. Its latest initiative, Cultural Crime Watchers Worldwide (CCWW) empowers people to leave anonymous tips to do with the destruction and looting of cultural heritage. Walk of Truth connects people with cultural heritage and cultural heritage with people.\n\nShe was nominated as “Woman of Europe 2008”, for her outstanding work in fighting art trafficking.

Written in part as an epistolary novel, it is largely narrated by the main character Edward \"Ted\" Wallace. Wallace is an alcoholic washed-up poet and theatre critic who, having been fired from his newspaper job, accepts a lucrative commission from his terminally ill goddaughter to investigate rumours of miracle healings at Swafford Hall, country mansion of Wallace's old friend Lord Logan.\n\nThe novel's title comes from the poem of the same name by T. S. Eliot, whose first verse is quoted as the epigraph:\n\nThe title draws comparisons between the animal as described in the poem and the main character, Ted Wallace, a slovenly man who enjoys long baths. (Hence cover designs picturing an actual hippopotamus or Fry himself in a bathtub.) The title and epigraph imply as well one of the novel's themes: the practicality of poetry and how that helps Wallace, a poet, regard the \"miracles\" in the story with a sceptical eye.\n\nThe \"hippo\" of the title (occasionally referred to as \"the happy hippo\" and given to wallowing in long baths) is Edward (Ted/Tedward) Lennox Wallace, an aging, lecherous, one-time hell-raising poet, reduced by diminishing poetic talent to working as a theatre critic. The story opens with the aftermath of Ted being fired from his job on a newspaper.\n\nAt the suggestion of a sick goddaughter, Jane (suffering from leukaemia), he goes to stay at the Norfolk country house of old schoolfriend and Army colleague from National Service, Lord Michael Logan and his wife Lady Anne, to investigate unspecified mysterious goings-on.\n\nTed reports back to Jane regularly, in the form of long, rambling letters, apprising her of events at Swafford Hall whilst also offering his views on numerous other issues (women, art, poetry, sex, morality and modern life being favorite topics), all the time attempting to uncover the nature of the unusual events that Jane has instructed him to look out for.\n\nOver the course of his stay it gradually becomes apparent that other house guests are ascribing healing powers to one of Logan's children, David (Ted's other godchild), and indeed it is in the hope that he might bestow his 'talent' upon them that they have descended upon Swafford Hall. Amongst the assembled guests are a witty and hugely camp, but rebarbative defrocked minister and TV producer, a businessman and his wife and rather gawky teenage daughter, a friend of Jane's, and Jane's mother, a woman Ted has crossed paths with disastrously many years earlier.\n\nThe life stories of the tycoon Logan and his family, as well as Ted's own, are intertwined to provide a colourful and credible back story. The story is run through with a stream of sexual practices, some more unusual than others, as Ted uncovers the means by which David delivers his 'healing'.\n\nThe story contains several (spoof) poems and limericks.\n\nA film of \"The Hippopotamus\" was shot in 2015 and released in 2017. The film was directed by John Jencks and stars Roger Allam as Ted Wallace and Matthew Modine as Lord Michael Logan. Russell Tovey, Scott Chambers and Rod Glenn also star. The script is by theatre director and writer Blanche McIntyre and Tom Hodgson, writer of \"Seve\", the 2014 biopic of Seve Ballesteros.\n"}

The book was promoted with the claim it was the first time the Conan Doyle Estate had authorised a new non-Doyle Sherlock Holmes pastiche.\n\n\"The House of Silk\" begins with a brief, personal recounting of events by Watson, much like that in \"A Study in Scarlet\" by the original author, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The reader is informed of the particulars regarding the first meeting of Watson and Holmes, including the circumstances of the Afghan War and a mention of the case that was \"too shocking to be revealed until now.\"\n\nThe client of \"The Flat Cap case\" is introduced as a man by the name of Edmund Carstairs, an art dealer whose paintings had been destroyed by a gang of Irish robbers. After the murder of Carstairs' client, and a failure on the part of a hired detective, he turns to Sherlock Holmes, who employs the aid of the Baker Street Irregulars, and upon locating the hotel wherein the supposed Keelan O'Donaghue (one of the leaders of the gang) is currently staying, one of the newest recruits of the Irregulars, a boy named Ross, is stationed to wait outside until Holmes, Watson, and Mr. Carstairs arrive. When the group finally arrives, Ross appears inexplicably horror-stricken and is later found brutally murdered by the thugs of the House of Silk.\nWhen Holmes makes inroads with the House of Silk case, he is framed for murder and sent to prison. Meanwhile, Watson meets with a mystery criminal, later revealed as Professor Moriarty, who provides him with a key to free Holmes from prison, before the detective can be assassinated. Professor Moriarty's motives are uncertain, except that he wishes Holmes to rid the world of the House of Silk, whose activities apparently appall even him. When Watson arrives at the prison, he discovers Holmes has escaped of his own accord, disguised as an aide to the prison doctor, whom he had once helped as a client. Various leads draw them to a travelling funfair, where they are ambushed, before being saved by Lestrade.\n\nThe party (Holmes, Watson, Lestrade) makes its way to the \"House of Silk\", a club operated by a pastor and his wife who also govern a boy's orphanage, and rent the boys to wealthy customers. The members are promptly rounded up by Scotland Yard. Despite their arrests, however, the case does not come to trial, due to a royal family member having been purportedly involved. It is eventually revealed that Mrs. Carstairs is the true person responsible for The Flat Cap case, being the second leader of the Irish gang.\n\nCritical reports were generally positive. On Anthony Horowitz's official site a review of \"The Guardian\" was posted, stating:\n\nSo, all of the elements are there: the data, the data, the data. Nothing of consequence overlooked. And yet can Horowitz, like Holmes, make from these drops of water the possibilities of an Atlantic or a Niagara? Can he astonish us? Can he thrill us? Are there \"the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis\" that we yearn for? Emphatically, yes.\nIn chapter one there is some mention of C. Auguste Dupin, a character developed by author Edgar Allan Poe, and his ability to make astounding deductions based on visible emotions reflected through the physical medium. Holmes demonstrates this by uncovering Watson's anxiety and the source thereof. This mention of Dupin is in itself a reference to a reference made by Conan Doyle to the character in the first Holmes novel \"A Study in Scarlet\".\n\nThe supporting character Ephraim Hardcastle (the landlord of the Bag of Nails pub, whose name is revealed in chapter eight) is a reference to the newspaper column of the same name in \"The Daily Mail\" as written pseudonymously by Nigel Dempster and subsequently Peter McKay.\n\nHorowitz announced a second installment entitled \"Moriarty\", but this time Holmes only appears at the end. Moreover, those detectives that Holmes had worked with in previous cases, such as Athelney Jones and Lestrade, were present.\n"}

The film was funded and distributed by the University of California Extension Center for Media. \n\nThe film is observational in style and the Turkana subjects speak for themselves through subtitles, rather than being spoken about through narration. The MacDougalls' films fit into the forefront of the movement away from narration and towards observational and participatory cinema in the 1970s and 1980s. The husband and wife team have made several ethnographic films. \"The Wedding Camels\" is the second of three they made about the Turkana, the others being \"Lorang's Way\" and \"A Wife Among Wives\". The trilogy is referred to as Turkana Conversations, which speaks to the fact that the McDougalls seem to specialize in forming a comfortable relationship with their subjects that allows them to enter into their private world and record not just interviews, but private conversations among families and community members.\n\n\"The Wedding Camels\" won the Royal Anthropological Institute's first Film Award in 1980, for best ethnographic film of the past five years.

{"id": "603325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=603325", "title": "Topic and comment", "text": "Topic and comment\n\nIn linguistics, the topic, or theme, of a sentence is what is being talked about, and the comment (rheme or focus) is what is being said about the topic. This opposition of the given/new information is called information structure. That the information structure of a clause is divided in this way is generally agreed on, but the boundary between topic/theme and comment/rheme/focus depends on grammatical theory. \n\nThe difference between \"topic\" and grammatical subject is that topic is used to describe the information structure, or pragmatic structure of a clause and how it coheres with other clauses, whereas the subject is a purely grammatical category. \"Topic\" and \"subject\" must also be distinguished from \"actor\" (or \"agent\"), the \"doer\". In English clauses with a verb in the passive voice, for instance, the topic is typically the subject, while the agent may be omitted or may follow the preposition \"by\". In some languages, word order and other syntactic phenomena are determined largely by the topic–comment (theme–rheme) structure. These languages are sometimes referred to as topic-prominent languages. Korean and Japanese are often given as examples of this.\n\nThe distinction was probably first suggested by Henri Weil in 1844. He established the\nconnection between information structure and word order. Georg von der Gabelentz distinguished psychological subject (roughly topic) and psychological object (roughly focus). In the Prague school, the dichotomy, termed topic–focus articulation, has been studied mainly by Vilém Mathesius, Jan Firbas, František Daneš, Petr Sgall and Eva Hajičová. They have been concerned mainly by its relation to intonation and word-order. Mathesius also pointed that the topic does not provide new information but connects the sentence to the context. The work of Michael Halliday in the 1960s is responsible for developing linguistic science through his systemic functional linguistics model for English.\n\nThe sentence- or clause-level \"topic\", or \"theme\", can be defined in a number of different ways. Among the most common are\n\nIn an ordinary English clause, the subject is normally the same as the topic/theme (example 1), even in the passive voice (where the subject is a patient, not an agent: example 2):\n\nThese clauses have different topics: the first is about \"the dog\", and the second about \"the little girl\".\n\nIn English it is also possible to use other sentence structures to show the topic of the sentence, as in the following:\n\nThe case of expletives is sometimes rather complex. Consider sentences with expletives (meaningless subjects), like:\n\n\nIn these examples the syntactic subject position (to the left of the verb) is manned by the meaningless expletive (\"it\" or \"there\"), whose sole purpose is satisfying the extended projection principle, and is nevertheless necessary. In these sentences the topic is never the subject, but is determined pragmatically. In all these cases, the whole sentence refers to the comment part.\n\nThe relation between topic/theme and comment/rheme/focus should not be confused with the topic-comment relation in Rhetorical structure theory Discourse Treebank (RST-DT corpus) where it is defined as \"a general statement or topic of discussion is introduced, after which a specific remark is made on the statement or topic\" (ex. \"[As far as the pound goes,] [some traders say a slide toward support at 1.5500 may be a favorable development for the dollar this week.]\") \n\nDifferent languages mark topics in different ways. Distinct intonation and word-order are the most common means. The tendency to place topicalized constituents sentence-initially (\"topic fronting\") is widespread. Topic fronting refers to placing the topic at the beginning\nof a clause regardless whether it is marked or not. Again, linguists disagree on many details. \n\nLanguages often show different kinds of grammar for sentences that introduce new topics and those that continue discussing previously established topics. \n\nWhen a sentence continues discussing a previously established topic, it is likely to use pronouns to refer to the topic. Such topics tend to be subjects. In many languages, pronouns referring to previously established topics will show pro-drop.\n\nThe topic/theme comes first in the clause, and is typically marked out by intonation as well.\n\n\nThe main application of the topic-comment structure is in the domain of speech technology, especially the design of embodied conversational agents (intonational focus assignment, relation between information structure and posture and gesture). There were some attempts to apply the theory of topic/comment for the information retrieval and the automatic summarization .\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15467877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15467877", "title": "Tourism carrying capacity", "text": "Tourism carrying capacity\n\nTourism carrying capacity is a now antiquated approach to managing visitors in protected areas and national parks which evolved out of the fields of range, habitat and wildlife management. In these fields, managers attempted to determine the largest population of a particular species that could be supported by a habitat over a long period of time. Many authors, such as Buckley, Wagar, Washburne, McCool, and Stankey have critiqued the concept as being fatally flawed in both the conceptual assumptions made and its limited practical application. For example, the notion of a carrying capacity assumes the world, such as the social-ecological systems in which protected areas and tourism destinations are situated, are stable. But we know they are dynamically complex and impossible to predict. We know that to implement a carrying capacity on a practical level, assumes a level of control of entries into a destination or protected area not usually found in the real world. We know that a carrying capacity, if one could be determined, requires considerable financial and technical resources to administer; and we know that when demand exceeds a limit, the ways in which scarce opportunities are allocated are contentious.\n\n\"Tourism Carrying Capacity\" is defined by the World Tourism Organization as “The maximum number of people that may visit a tourist destination at the same time, without causing destruction of the physical, economic, socio-cultural environment and an unacceptable decrease in the quality of visitors' satisfaction”. Whereas Middleton and Hawkins Chamberlain (1997) define it as “the level of human activity an area can accommodate without the area deteriorating, the resident community being adversely affected or the quality of visitors experience declining” what both these definitions pick up on is carrying capacity is the point at which a destination or attraction starts experiencing adverse as a result of the number of visitors.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no studies which support this notion of visitor management. For example, in areas which have an objective of maintaining pristine conditions, any level of visitor use creates adverse or negative impacts, suggesting that the carrying capacity is zero. Fundamentally, acceptable conditions are a matter of human judgment, not an inherent quality of a particular site. Understanding these acceptable conditions is the focus of the limits of acceptable change planning process referred to later in this article.\n\nThere are number of different forms of carrying capacity referred to in tourism, however this article will focus on the four most commonly used. However, these conceptions are useful only to the extent they focus discussion and discourse, not practical application.\n\nThis is the maximum number of tourists that an area is actually able to support. In the case of an individual tourist attraction it is the maximum number that can fit on the site at any given time and still allow people to be able to move. This is normally assumed to be around 1m per person.\n“PCC per a day = area (in metres squared) x visitors per metre x daily duration\" (Mowforth and Munt)\nThis is a formula which has been used to calculate the physical carrying capacity.\n\nThis relates to a level of acceptable change within the local economy of a tourist destination, it is the extent to which a tourist destination is able to accommodate tourist functions without the loss of local activities, take for example a souvenir store taking the place of a shop selling essential items to the local community. Economic carrying capacity can also be used to describe the point at which the increased revenue brought by tourism development is overtaken by the inflation caused by tourism.\n\nThis relates to the negative socio-cultural related to tourism development. The indicators of when the social carrying capacity has been exceeded are a reduced local tolerance for tourism as described by Doxey’s Index of irritation. Reduced visitor enjoyment and increased crime are also indicators of when the social carrying capacity has been exceeded.\n\nThis deals with the extent to which the natural environment is able to tolerate interference from tourists. This is made more complicated by the fact that because it deals with ecology which is able to regenerate to some extent so in this case the carrying capacity is when the damage exceeds the habitat's ability to regenerate. \n\nEnvironmental carrying capacity is also used with reference to ecological and physical parameters, capacity of resources, ecosystems and infrastructure.\n\nThe main criticism of carrying capacity is that is fundamentally flawed conceptually and practically. Conceptually, the notion of an inherent carrying capacity assumes a stable and predictable world, a \"J-shaped\" curve in the relationship between use level and impact, and techno-scientific view of what are essential value judgments. On the practical level, it is difficult to calculate a maximum number of visitors because this is also dependent on other factors like the way in which the tourists behave ‘a large group of bird Watchers moving through a landscape will have a different impact compared to a similar sized group of school children.’ In the case of natural heritage like national parks, visitor impacts change with seasons. What is important is the acceptability or appropriateness of these impacts, an issue that is largely dependent on social and cultural value systems with science having an input.\n\nUNESCO (the organization responsible for administrating the World Heritage list) has expressed a concern that the use of Carrying capacity can give the impression that a site is better protected than it actually is, it points out that although the whole site may be below carrying capacity part of the site may still be crowded.\n\nIn the context of tourism in wildlife sanctuaries Singh (2013) writes, ‘carrying capacity’ is a concept to be thought about when we intend for ‘sustainable versus full harvest/utilization of resource for a purpose’. In wildlife sanctuaries ‘full utilization of infrastructure or resource for tourism’ is a remote mandate, unthinkable. Hence, instead of ‘carrying capacity’ it is recommended to have a set of guidelines for regulating tourism without much disturbing the wildlife. That will perhaps be sustainable for both wildlife conservation and tourism industry.\n\nLimits of acceptable change was the first of the post carrying capacity visitor management frameworks developed to respond to the practical and conceptual failures of carrying capacity. The framework was developed by The U.S. forest service in the 1980s. It is based on the idea that rather than there being a threshold of visitor numbers, in fact any tourist activity is having an impact and therefore management should be based on constant monitoring of the site as well as the objectives established for it. It is possible that with in the Limit of acceptable change framework a visitor limit can be established but such limits are only one tool available. The framework is frequently summarised in to a nine step process.\n\n1. Identify area concerns and issues.\n2. Define and describe opportunity classes (based on the concept of ROS).\n3. Select indicators of resource and social conditions.\n4. Inventory existing resource and social conditions.\n5. Specify standards for resource and social indicators for each opportunity class.\n6. Identify alternative opportunity class allocations.\n7. Identify management actions for each alternative.\n8. Evaluate and select preferred alternatives.\n9. Implement actions and monitor conditions. \n\nThe reader should note however, that there is a difference of LAC as a concept and LAC as a planning framework.\n\nThis framework is based on the idea that not enough attention has been given to the experience of tourists and their views on environmental quality. This framework is similar in origin to LAC, but was originally designed to meet the legislative, policy and administrative needs of the US National Park Service.\n\nThe process of estimating Tourism Carrying Capacity (TCC) has been described as having a descriptive and evaluative part. It follows (in principle) the conceptual framework for TCC as described by Shelby and Heberlein (1986), and these parts are described as follows:\n\nDescriptive part (A): Describes how the system (tourist destination) under study works, including physical, ecological, social, political and economic aspects of tourist development. Within this context of particular importance is the identification of:\n\nEvaluative part (B): Describes how an area should be managed and the level of acceptable environmental impacts. This part of the process starts with the identification (if it does not already exist) of the desirable condition or preferable type of development. Within this context, goals and management objectives need to be defined, alternative fields of actions evaluated and a strategy for tourist development formulated. On the basis of this, Tourism Carrying Capacity can be defined. Within this context, of particular importance is the identification of:\n\nFirst of all, the carrying capacity can be the motivation to attract tourists visit the destination. The tourism industry, especially in national parks and protected areas, is subject to the concept of carrying capacity so as to determine the scale of tourist activities which can be sustained at specific times in different places. Various scholar over the years have developed several arguments developed about the definition of carrying capacity. Middleton and Hawkins defined carrying capacity as a measure of the tolerance of a site or building which is open to tourist activities, and the limit beyond which an area may suffer from the adverse impacts of tourism (Middleton & Hawkins, 1998). Chamberlain defined it as the level of human activity which an area can accommodate without either it deteriorating, the resident community being adversely affected or the quality of visitors' experience declining (Chamberlain, 1997). Clark defined carrying capacity as a certain threshold (level) of tourism activity, beyond which there will be damage to the environment and its natural inhabitants (Clark, 1997).\n\nThe World Tourism Organization argues that carrying capacity is the maximum number of people who may visit a tourist destination at the same time, without causing destruction of the physical, economic and socio-cultural environment and/or an unacceptable decrease in the quality of visitors' satisfaction (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/iczm/pdf/tcca_material.pdf. Date assessed 08/03/07). In the publication, ‘Agenda 21 for the Travel and Tourism Venture: towards environmentally sustainable development’, the Secretary-General of the World Tourism Organization.\n\nThe definitions of carrying capacity need to be considered as processes within a planning process for tourism development which involves:\n“Carrying capacity is not just a scientific concept or formula of obtaining a number beyond which development should cease, but a process where the eventual limits must be considered as guidance. They should be carefully assessed and monitored, complemented with other standards, etc. Carrying capacity is not fixed. It develops with time and the growth of tourism and can be affected by management techniques and controls” (Saveriades, 2000).\nThe reason for considering carrying capacity as a process, rather than a means of protection of various areas is in spite of the fact that carrying capacity was once a guiding concept in recreation and tourism management literature. Because of its conceptual elusiveness, lack of management utility and inconsistent effectiveness in minimising visitors' impacts, carrying capacity has been largely re-conceptualized into management by objectives approaches, namely: the limits of acceptable change (LAC), and the visitor experience and resource protection (VERP) as the two planning and management decision-making processes based on the new understanding of carrying capacity (Lindberg and McCool, 1998). These two have been deemed more appropriate in the tourism planning processes of protected areas, especially in the United States, and have over the years been adapted and modified for use in sustainable tourism and ecotourism contexts (Wallace, 1993; McCool, 1994; Harroun and Boo, 1995).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33679392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33679392", "title": "Winter: Five Windows on the Season", "text": "Winter: Five Windows on the Season\n\nWinter: Five Windows on the Season is a non-fiction book written by Adam Gopnik for the 2011 Massey Lectures. Each of the book's five chapters had been delivered as a one-hour lecture discussing artistic portrayals of winter: its impact on culture and societies, polar exploration, and winter recreation. Each lecture was held in a different Canadian city: Montreal on October 12, Halifax on October 14, Edmonton on October 21, Vancouver on October 23, and ending in Toronto on October 26. The book was published by House of Anansi Press while the lectures were broadcast on CBC Radio One's \"Ideas\" between November 7–11.\n\nWhile Gopnik was raised in Montreal, by 2011 he worked as a staff writer for \"The New Yorker\" magazine in New York City. Gopnik selected 'winter' as his general topic and spent nearly a year preparing for the lectures.\n\nAdam Gopnik was selected to deliver the 2011 Massey Lectures, the annual week-long series of lectures on a political, cultural or philosophical topic given in Canada by a noted scholar. Gopnik was chosen by the panel of representatives from Massey College, House of Anansi Press and the CBC, the organizations responsible for coordinating the lectures. This would be the 50th anniversary of the Massey Lectures and coincide with the 75th anniversary of the CBC. \"Ideas\" executive producer Bernie Lucht contacted Gopnik by email to inform him of the panel's decision and to ask if he would accept. At the time Gopnik was living in New York City, working as a staff writer for \"The New Yorker\" magazine. He had previously authored several books on different topics, the most successful being \"Paris to the Moon\", a collection of essays published in 2000. Gopnik read Lucht's email while waiting for a bus on Madison Avenue. Gopnik later stated that by the end of the 20-minute bus ride he had already selected a topic and had a good idea of the issues he would address.\n\nUnderstanding the Massey Lectures were part of the Canadian culture, Gopnik, who was born in Philadelphia but lived in Montreal between the ages of 10 to 25, wanted a topic that would be relevant to Canadians but also have universal appeal: winter. Winter had appeared as a theme or setting in many of his previous writings, and he especially looked forward to talking about ice hockey. Gopnik spent the next year researching and writing the book, alongside another non-fiction book he was working on at the time: \"The Table Comes First: Family, France, and the Meaning of Food\". This other book was released shortly after \"Winter\", and purposefully contained one identical sentence.\n\nThere are five chapters, each of which consider a different aspect of winter. The first chapter, \"Romantic Winter\", describes how winter has been portrayed since the 1700s from the point of view of artists and writers. According to Gopnik, the view of winter has changed over time, from something that had to be overcome to something romanticized as hearths, glass windows, and coal heating made the cold more tolerable. Other factors, such as nationalism, religion, technology, also changed the social view of winter from being portrayed as \"bleak and bitter to sweet and sublime\". The second chapter, \"Radical Winter\", recounts the history of polar expeditions, including John Ross, John Franklin, Robert Peary, Robert Falcon Scott, Roald Amundsen, and Ernest Shackleton.\n\n\"Recuperative Winter\" reviews the cultural and social history of winter festivals and holidays. Gopnik posits that the modern Christmas is a compound holiday merging elements from numerous societies, traditions, and beliefs; that its moral foundations were established in the 1820/30s; its celebratory and commercialism elements were established in the 1870s. He also argues that stress and anxiety have been part of the holiday since the 1920s. \"Recreational Winter\" is about winter sports, like ice hockey. The evolution of ice skating is identified from the Dutch bringing the concept to England in the 1600s and the origin of hockey is traced back to a particular neighbourhood in Montreal in the 1800s. He portrays winter sports as being more about preparation and the pleasure of solitude, in contrast with summer sports, which are more about impulse. The final chapter, \"Remembering Winter\", discusses three ways that the human experience of winter is changing: through technological and architectural innovations, via global warming, and by memory.\n\nThe chapters are written so that they could be read as lectures. Though several reviewers referred to them as essays, Gopnik made the distinction between an essay, which is written to be read silently, and a lecture, which is meant to be spoken and keeps some of the rhythm of speech. Gopnik purposefully tried \"to keep them as conversational as possible [and so] they lack the polish of his \"New Yorker\" essays\". The lectures' conversational tone, with both common and arcane references, was meant to appeal to a \"middlebrow\" audience; they were designed to be \"profound and significant\" but not academic. The reviewer in \"The Observer\" described the writing as \"designed to maintain a constant flame of curiosity in a lecture room shut against the cold\".\n\nThe book was called an \"elegy for a season\". Encyclopedist James Harley Marsh believes that the central theme was, as Gopnik himself writes, that \"winter started as this thing we had to get through; it has ended as this time to hold on to\". The \"Edmonton Journal\" reviewer describes Gopnik's guiding metaphor for his approach to winter as \"ice wine: sweetness made from stress\", that the perceived benefits of winter come directly from the hardships it brings. Ian McGillis in the \"Montreal Review of Books\" identifies \"two simple ideas that govern and unite the five lectures\": first, that the view from inside can provide a better developed idea of what is outside, and second, that winter continues to defy the human need to consistently name and organize the world.\n\nThe book was published by House of Anansi Press and released on September 26, 2011. The five chapters/lectures were delivered by Gopnik in five locations across Canada: the first chapter was delivered in Montreal on October 12, the second in Halifax (Dalhousie Arts Centre) on October 14, the third in Edmonton (University of Alberta) on October 21, the fourth in Vancouver (Chan Centre for the Performing Arts) on October 23, and the final chapter in The Royal Conservatory of Music at the University of Toronto on October 26. Gopnik was in Guelph on October 25 where he recited passages and promoted the book. An excerpt was published in the October 3 edition of \"Maclean's\" magazine.\n\nReviewers variously described the book as \"interesting\", \"charming\" and \"fascinating\" and the prose as \"eloquent\", \"thoughtful\", but sometimes slow. The \"Publishers Weekly\" review stated that \"Gopnik leavens dense material with humor, and makes unwieldy concepts accessible through modern-day comparisons\". Bill Rambo in the \"Winnipeg Free Press\" said that it \"reads smoothly and effectively [and demonstrates] encyclopedic knowledge and incisive research into a subject\", concluding that the chapter Recreational Winter about sports was the most passionate. Charles Wilkins in \"The Globe and Mail\" found Remembering Winter, the chapter about cultural and social memories of winter to be the \"most personal and poignant\" and entertaining. Helen Gallagher in the \"New York Journal of Books\" \"highly recommended\" the book.\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom, in November 2012, by Quercus, a London-based independent publishing house. The review in \"The Daily Telegraph\" concluded that \"while there are flashes of brilliance here, there's also a nagging sense that he's snatching at snowflakes. Time and time again one comes across statements that look, and sound good - these pieces were originally delivered as lectures - but which just don't stand up to analysis.\" The reviewer cited examples, like the illustrations of the theatrics people display when coming in from the cold and the isolated feelings of downhill skiers which the reviewer rebutted with similar examples of the same that occur in temperate climates. Nick Rennison reviewed the book for \"The Sunday Times\", writing that \"any writer who can take subjects as diverse as [these]...and find something original and interesting to say about each of them, has to be worth reading.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "30864554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30864554", "title": "Women's history", "text": "Women's history\n\nWomen's history is the study of the role that women have played in history and the methods required to do so. It includes the study of the history of the growth of woman's rights throughout recorded history, personal achievement over a period of time, the examination of individual and groups of women of historical significance, and the effect that historical events have had on women. Inherent in the study of women's history is the belief that more traditional recordings of history have minimized or ignored the contributions of women to different fields and the effect that historical events had on women as a whole; in this respect, women's history is often a form of historical revisionism, seeking to challenge or expand the traditional historical consensus.\n\nThe main centers of scholarship have been the United States and Britain, where second-wave feminist historians, influenced by the new approaches promoted by social history, led the way. As activists in women's liberation, discussing and analyzing the oppression and inequalities they experienced as women, they believed it imperative to learn about the lives of their fore mothers—and found very little scholarship in print. History was written mainly by men and about men's activities in the public sphere especially in Africa—war, politics, diplomacy and administration. Women are usually excluded and, when mentioned, are usually portrayed in sex-stereotypical roles such as wives, mothers, daughters, and mistresses. The study of history is value-laden in regard to what is considered historically \"worthy.\" Other aspects of this area of study is the differences in women's lives caused by race, economic status, social status, and various other aspects of society.\n\nChanges came in the 19th and 20th centuries; for example, for women, the right to equal pay is now enshrined in law. Women traditionally ran the household, bore and reared the children, were nurses, mothers, wives, neighbours, friends, and teachers. During periods of war, women were drafted into the labor market to undertake work that had been traditionally restricted to men. Following the wars, they invariably lost their jobs in industry and had to return to domestic and service roles.\n\nThe history of Scottish women in the late 19th century and early 20th century was not fully developed as a field of study until the 1980s. In addition, most work on women before 1700 has been published since 1980. Several studies have taken a biographical approach, but other work has drawn on the insights from research elsewhere to examine such issues as work, family, religion, crime, and images of women. Scholars are also uncovering women's voices in their letters, memoirs, poetry, and court records. Because of the late development of the field, much recent work has been recuperative, but increasingly the insights of gender history, both in other countries and in Scottish history after 1700, are being used to frame the questions that are asked. Future work should contribute both to a reinterpretation of the current narratives of Scottish history and also to a deepening of the complexity of the history of women in late medieval and early modern Britain and Europe.\n\nIn Ireland studies of women, and gender relationships more generally, had been rare before 1990; they now are commonplace with some 3000 books and articles in print.\n\nFrench historians have taken a unique approach: there has been an extensive scholarship in women's and gender history despite the lack of women's and gender study programs or departments at the university level. But approaches used by other academics in the research of broadly based social histories have been applied to the field of women's history as well. The high level of research and publication in women's and gender history is due to the high interest within French society. The structural discrimination in academia against the subject of gender history in France is changing due to the increase in international studies following the formation of the European Union, and more French scholars seeking appointments outside Europe.\n\nBefore the 19th century, young women lived under the economic and disciplinary authority of their fathers until they married and passed under the control of their husbands. In order to secure a satisfactory marriage, a woman needed to bring a substantial dowry. In the wealthier families, daughters received their dowry from their families, whereas the poorer women needed to work in order to save their wages so as to improve their chances to wed. Under the German laws, women had property rights over their dowries and inheritances, a valuable benefit as high mortality rates resulted in successive marriages. Before 1789, the majority of women lived confined to society's private sphere, the home.\nThe Age of Reason did not bring much more for women: men, including Enlightenment aficionados, believed that women were naturally destined to be principally wives and mothers. Within the educated classes, there was the belief that women needed to be sufficiently educated to be intelligent and agreeable interlocutors to their husbands. However, the lower-class women were expected to be economically productive in order to help their husbands make ends meet.\n\nIn the newly founded German State (1871), women of all social classes were politically and socially disenfranchised. The code of social respectability confined upper class and bourgeois women to their homes. They were considered socially and economically inferior to their husbands. The unmarried women were ridiculed, and the ones who wanted to avoid social descent could work as unpaid housekeepers living with relatives; the ablest could work as governesses or they could become nuns.\n\nA significant number of middle-class families became impoverished between 1871 and 1890 as the pace of industrial growth was uncertain, and women had to earn money in secret by sewing or embroidery to contribute to the family income.\nIn 1865, the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein (ADF) was founded as an umbrella organization for women's associations, demanding rights to education, employment, and political participation. Three decades later, the Bund Deutscher Frauenverbände (BDF) replaced ADF and excluded from membership the proletarian movement that was part of the earlier group. The two movements had differing views concerning women's place in society, and accordingly, they also had different agendas. The bourgeois movement made important contributions to the access of women to education and employment (mainly office-based and teaching). The proletarian movement, on the other hand, developed as a branch of the Social Democratic Party. As factory jobs became available for women, they campaigned for equal pay and equal treatment. In 1908 German women won the right to join political parties, and in 1918 they were finally granted the right to vote. The emancipation of women in Germany was to be challenged in following years.\n\nHistorians have paid special attention to the efforts by Nazi Germany to reverse the political and social gains that women made before 1933, especially in the relatively liberal Weimar Republic. The role of women in Nazi Germany changed according to circumstances. Theoretically, the Nazis believed that women must be subservient to men, avoid careers, devote themselves to childbearing and child-rearing, and be helpmates to the traditional dominant fathers in the traditional family. But, before 1933, women played important roles in the Nazi organization and were allowed some autonomy to mobilize other women. After Hitler came to power in 1933, the activist women were replaced by bureaucratic women, who emphasized feminine virtues, marriage, and childbirth.\n\nAs Germany prepared for war, large numbers of women were incorporated into the public sector and, with the need for full mobilization of factories by 1943, all women were required to register with the employment office. Hundreds of thousands of women served in the military as nurses and support personnel, and another hundred thousand served in the Luftwaffe, especially helping to operate the anti-aircraft systems. Women's wages remained unequal and women were denied positions of leadership or control.\n\nMore than two million women were murdered in the Holocaust. The Nazi ideology viewed women generally as agents of fertility. Accordingly, it identified the Jewish woman as an element to be exterminated to prevent the rise of future generations. For these reasons, the Nazis treated women as prime targets for annihilation in the Holocaust.\n\nInterest in the study of women's history in Eastern Europe has been delayed. Representative is Hungary, where the historiography has been explored by Petö and Szapor (2007). Academia resisted incorporating this specialized field of history, primarily because of the political atmosphere and a lack of institutional support. Before 1945, historiography dealt chiefly with nationalist themes that supported the anti-democratic political agenda of the state. After 1945, academia reflected a Soviet model. Instead of providing an atmosphere in which women could be the subjects of history, this era ignored the role of the women's rights movement in the early 20th century. The collapse of Communism in 1989 was followed by a decade of promising developments in which biographies of prominent Hungarian women were published, and important moments of women's political and cultural history were the subjects of research. However, the quality of this scholarship was uneven and failed to take advantage of the methodological advances in research in the West. In addition, institutional resistance continued, as evidenced by the lack of undergraduate or graduate programs dedicated to women's and gender history at Hungarian universities.\n\nWomen's history in Russia started to become important in the Czarist era, and concern was shown in the consciousness and writing of Alexander Pushkin. During the Soviet Era, feminism was developed along with ideals of equality, but in practice and in domestic arrangements, men often dominate.\n\nBy the 1990s new periodicals, especially \"Casus\" and \"Odysseus: Dialogue with Time, Adam and Eve\" stimulated women's history and, more recently, gender history. Using the concept of gender has shifted the focus from women to socially and culturally constructed notions of sexual difference. It has led to deeper debates on historiography and holds a promise of stimulating the development of a new \"general\" history able to integrate personal, local, social, and cultural history.\n\nGeneral overviews of women in Asian history are scarce, since most specialists focus on China, Japan, India, Korea or another traditionally defined region.\n\nPublished work generally deals with women as visible participants in the revolution, employment as vehicles for women's liberation, Confucianism and the cultural concept of family as sources of women's oppression. While rural marriage rituals, such as bride price and dowry, have remained the same in form, their function has changed. This reflects the decline of the extended family and the growth in women's agency in the marriage transaction. In recent scholarship in China, the concept of gender has yielded a bounty of new knowledge in English- and Chinese-language writings.\n\"Zhongguo fu nü sheng Huo shi\" () is a historical book written by Chen Dongyuan in 1928 and published by The Commercial Press in 1937. The book, the first to give a systematic introduction to women's history in China, has strongly influenced further research in this field.\n\nThe book sheds a light on Chinese women's life ranging from ancient times (prior to Zhou Dynasty) to the Republic of China. In the book, sections are separated based on dynasties in China. Sections are divided into segments to introduce different themes, such as marriage, feudal ethical codes, education for women, virtues, positions, the concept of chastity, foot-binding and women's rights movement in modern China. Inspired by the anti-traditional thoughts in New Culture Movement, the author devoted much effort to disclosing and denouncing the unfairness and suppression in culture, institutions, and life that victimize women in China. According to the book, women's conditions are slightly improved until modern China. in the Preface of the book, the author writes: since women in China are always subject to abuse, the history of women is, naturally the history of abuse of women in China. The author revealed the motivation: the book intends to explain how the principle of women being inferior to men evolves; how the abuse to women is intensified over time; and how the misery on women's back experience the history change. The author wants to promote women's liberation by revealing the political and social suppression of women.\n\nMann (2009) explores how Chinese biographers have depicted women over two millennia (221 BCE to 1911), especially during the Han dynasty. Zhang Xuecheng, Sima Qian, and Zhang Huiyan and other writers often study women of the governing class, and their representation in domestic scenes of death in the narratives and in the role of martyrs.\n\nThe historiography of women in the history of Tibet confronts the suppression of women's histories in the social narratives of an exiled community. McGranahan (2010) examines the role of women in the 20th century, especially during the Chinese invasion and occupation of Tibet. She studies women in the Tibetan resistance army, the subordination of women in a Buddhist society, and the persistent concept of menstrual blood as a contaminating agent.\n1998\n\nJapanese women's history was marginal to historical scholarship until the late 20th century. The subject hardly existed before 1945, and, even after that date, many academic historians were reluctant to accept women's history as a part of Japanese history. The social and political climate of the 1980s in particular, favorable in many ways to women, gave opportunities for Japanese women's historiography and also brought the subject fuller academic recognition. Exciting and innovative research on Japanese women's history began in the 1980s. Much of this has been conducted not only by academic women's historians, but also by freelance writers, journalists, and amateur historians; that is, by people who have been less restricted by traditional historical methods and expectations. The study of Japanese women's history has become accepted as part of the traditional topics.\n\nWith a handful of exceptions, there was a little serious history of women in Australia or New Zealand before the 1970s.\n\nA pioneering study was Patricia Grimshaw, \"Women's Suffrage in New Zealand\" (1972), explaining how that remote colony became the first country in the world to give women the vote. Women's history as an academic discipline emerged in the mid-1970s, typified by Miriam Dixson, \"The Real Matilda: Woman and Identity in Australia, 1788 to the Present\" (1976). The first studies were compensatory, filling in the vacuum where women had been left out. In common with developments in the United States and Britain, there was a movement toward gender studies, with a field dominated by feminists.\n\nOther important topics include demography and family history. Of recent importance are studies of the role of women on the homefront, and in military service, during world wars. See Australian women in World War I and Australian women in World War II.\n\nIn the 1980s scholarship began to appear on topics regarding the Middle East.\n\nNumerous short studies have appeared for women's history in African nations.\n\nThere are numerous studies for specific countries and regions, such as Nigeria. and Lesotho.\n\nScholars have turned their imagination to innovative sources for the history of African women, such as songs from Malawi, weaving techniques in Sokoto, and historical linguistics.\n\nApart from individual women, working largely on their own, the first organized systematic efforts to develop women's history came from the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) in the early 20th century. It coordinated efforts across the South to tell the story of the women on the Confederate home front, while the male historians spent their time with battles and generals. The women emphasized female activism, initiative, and leadership. They reported that when all the men left for war, the women took command, found ersatz and substitute foods, rediscovered their old traditional skills with the spinning wheel when factory cloth became unavailable, and ran all the farm or plantation operations. They faced danger without having menfolk in the traditional role of their protectors. Historian Jacquelyn Dowd Hall argue that the UDC was a powerful promoter of women's history:\nThe work of women scholars was ignored by the male-dominated history profession until the 1960s, when the first breakthroughs came. Gerda Lerner in 1963 offered the first regular college course in women's history. The field of women's history exploded dramatically after 1970, along with the growth of the new social history and the acceptance of women into graduate programs in history departments. In 1972, Sarah Lawrence College began offering a Master of Arts Program in Women's History, founded by Gerda Lerner, that was the first American graduate degree in the field. Another important development was to integrate women into the history of race and slavery. A pioneering effort was Deborah Gray White's \"'Ar'n't I a Woman? Female Slaves in the Plantation South\" (1985), which helped to open up analysis of race, slavery, abolitionism, and feminism, as well as resistance, power, and activism, and themes of violence, sexualities, and the body. A major trend in recent years has been to emphasize a global perspective. Although the word \"women\" is the eighth most commonly used word in abstracts of all historical articles in North America, it is only the twenty-third most used word in abstracts of historical articles in other regions. Furthermore, \"gender\" appears about twice as frequently in American history abstracts compared to abstracts covering the rest of the world.\n\nIn recent years, historians of women have reached out to web-oriented students. Examples of these outreach efforts are the websites \"Women and Social Movements in the United States\", maintained by Kathryn Kish Sklar and Thomas Dublin. and \"Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution\".\n\nIn the Ancien Régime in France, few women held any formal power; some queens did, as did the heads of Catholic convents. In the Enlightenment, the writings of philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau provided a political program for reform of the ancien régime, founded on a reform of domestic mores. Rousseau's conception of the relations between private and public spheres is more unified than that found in modern sociology. Rousseau argued that the domestic role of women is a structural precondition for a \"modern\" society.\n\nSalic law prohibited women from rule; however, the laws for the case of a regency, when the king was too young to govern by himself, brought the queen into the centre of power. The queen could ensure the passage of power from one king to another—from her late husband to her young son—while simultaneously assuring the continuity of the dynasty.\n\nEducational aspirations were on the rise and were becoming increasingly institutionalized in order to supply the church and state with the functionaries to serve as their future administrators. Girls were schooled too, but not to assume political responsibility. Girls were ineligible for leadership positions and were generally considered to have an inferior intellect to their brothers. France had many small local schools where working-class children - both boys and girls - learned to read, the better \"to know, love, and serve God.\" The sons and daughters of the noble and bourgeois elites were given gender-specific educations: boys were sent to upper school, perhaps a university, while their sisters - if they were lucky enough to leave the house - would be sent to board at a convent with a vague curriculum. The Enlightenment challenged this model, but no real alternative was presented for female education. Only through education at home were knowledgeable women formed, usually to the sole end of dazzling their salons.\n\nWomen's rights refers to the social and human rights of women. In the United States, the abolition movements sparked an increased wave of attention to the status of women, but the history of feminism reaches to before the 18th century. (See protofeminism.) The advent of the reformist age during the 19th century meant that those invisible minorities or marginalized majorities were to find a catalyst and a microcosm in such new tendencies of reform. The earliest works on the so-called \"woman question\" criticized the restrictive role of women, without necessarily claiming that women were disadvantaged or that men were to blame. In Britain, the Feminism movement began in the 19th century and continues in the present day. Simone de Beauvoir wrote a detailed analysis of women's oppression in her 1949 treatise \"The Second Sex.\" It became a foundational tract of contemporary feminism. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, feminist movements, such as the one in the United States substantially changed the condition of women in the Western world. One trigger for the revolution was the development of the birth control pill in 1960, which gave women access to easy and reliable contraception in order to conduct family planning.\n\nWomen's historians have debated the impact of capitalism on the status of women. Taking a pessimistic side, Alice Clark argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th century England, it made a negative impact on the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that in the 16th century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labor with the husband taking paid labor jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle-class and women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on many women. In a more positive interpretation, Ivy Pinchbeck argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation. Tilly and Scott have to Emphasize the continuity and the status of women, finding three stages in European history. In the preindustrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the \"family wage economy\" of early industrialization, the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage is the \"family consumer economy,\" in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.\n\nThe 1870 US Census was the first to count \"Females engaged in each and every occupation\" and provides a snapshot of women's history. It reveals that, contrary to popular myth, not all American women of the Victorian period were \"safe\" in their middle-class homes or working in sweatshops. Women composed 15% of the total workforce (1.8 million out of 12.5). They made up one-third of factory \"operatives,\" and were concentrated in teaching, as the nation emphasized expanding education; dressmaking, millinery, and tailoring. Two-thirds of teachers were women. They also worked in iron and steel works (495), mines (46), sawmills (35), oil wells and refineries (40), gas works (4), and charcoal kilns (5), and held such surprising jobs as ship rigger (16), teamster (196), turpentine laborer (185), brass founder/worker (102), shingle and lathe maker (84), stock-herder (45), gun and locksmith (33), hunter and trapper (2). There were five lawyers, 24 dentists, and 2,000 doctors.\n\nMarriage ages of women can be used as an indicator of the position of women in society. Women's age at marriage could influence economic development, partly because women marrying at higher ages had more opportunities to acquire human capital.\nOn average, across the world, marriage ages of women have been rising. However, countries such as Mexico, China, Egypt, and Russia have shown a smaller increase in this measure of female empowerment than, for example, Japan.\n\nIn the history of sex, the social construction of sexual behavior—its taboos, regulation and social and political effects—has had a profound effect on women in the world since prehistoric times. Absent assured ways of controlling reproduction, women have practiced abortion since ancient times; many societies have also practice infanticide to ensure the survival of older children. Historically, it is unclear how often the ethics of abortion (induced abortion) was discussed in societies. In the latter half of the 20th century, some nations began to legalize abortion. This controversial subject has sparked heated debate and in some cases, violence, as different parts of society have different social and religious ideas about its meaning.\n\nWomen have been exposed to various tortuous sexual conditions and have been discriminated against in various fashions in history. In addition to women being sexual victims of troops in warfare, an institutionalized example was the Japanese military enslaving native women and girls as comfort women in military brothels in Japanese-occupied countries during World War II.\n\nThe social aspects of clothing have revolved around traditions regarding certain items of clothing intrinsically suited different gender roles. In different periods, both women's and men's fashions have highlighted one area or another of the body for attention. In particular, the wearing of skirts and trousers has given rise to common phrases expressing implied restrictions in use and disapproval of offending behavior. For example, ancient Greeks often considered the wearing of trousers by Persian men as a sign of an effeminate attitude. Women's clothing in Victorian fashion was used as a means of control and admiration. Reactions to the elaborate confections of French fashion led to various calls for reform on the grounds of both beauties (Artistic and Aesthetic dress) and health (dress reform; especially for undergarments and lingerie). Although trousers for women did not become fashionable until the later 20th century, women began wearing men's trousers (suitably altered) for outdoor work a hundred years earlier. In the 1960s, André Courrèges introduced long trousers for women as a fashion item, leading to the era of the pantsuit and designer jeans, and the gradual eroding of the prohibitions against girls and women wearing trousers in schools, the workplace, and fine restaurants. Corsets have long been used for fashion, and body modification, such as waistline reduction. There were, and are, many different styles and types of corsets, varying depending on the intended use, corset maker's style, and the fashions of the era.\n\nThe social status of women in the Victoria Era is often seen as an illustration of the striking discrepancy between the nation's power and richness and what many consider its appalling social conditions. Victorian morality was full of contradictions. A plethora of social movements concerned with improving public morals co-existed with a class system that permitted and imposed harsh living conditions for many, such as women. In this period, an outward appearance of dignity and restraint was valued, but the usual \"vices\" continued, such as prostitution. In the Victorian era, the bathing machine was developed and flourished. It was a device to allow people to wade in the ocean at beaches without violating Victorian notions of modesty about having \"limbs\" revealed. The bathing machine was part of sea-bathing etiquette that was more rigorously enforced upon women than men.\n\nThe Roaring Twenties is a term for society and culture in the 1920s in the Western world. It was a period of sustained economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, particularly in major cities.\n\nWomen's suffrage came about in many major countries in the 1920s, including United States, Canada, Great Britain. many countries expanded women's voting rights in representative and direct democracies across the world such as the US, Canada, Great Britain and most major European countries in 1917–21, as well as India. This influenced many governments and elections by increasing the number of voters available. Politicians responded by spending more attention on issues of concern to women, especially pacifism, public health, education, and the status of children. On the whole, women voted much like their menfolk, except they were more pacifistic.\n\nThe 1920s marked a revolution in fashion. The new woman danced, drank, smoked and voted. She cut her hair short, wore make-up and partied. Sometimes she smoked a cigarette. She was known for being giddy and taking risks; she was a flapper. More women took jobs making them more independent and free. With their desire for freedom and independence came as well change in fashion, welcoming a more comfortable style, where the waistline was just above the hips and loosen, and staying away from the Victorian style with a corset and tight waistline.\n\nWith widespread unemployment among men, poverty, and the need to help family members who are in even worse condition, The pressures were heavy on women during the Great Depression across the modern world. A primary role was as a housewife. Without a steady flow of family income, their work became much harder in dealing with food and clothing and medical care. The birthrates fell everywhere, as children were postponed until families could financially support them. The average birthrate for 14 major countries fell 12% from 19.3 births per thousand population in 1930 to 17.0 in 1935. In Canada, half of Roman Catholic women defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births.\n\nAmong the few women in the labor force, layoffs were less common in the white-collar jobs and they were typically found in light manufacturing work. However, there was a widespread demand to limit families to one paid job, so that wives might lose employment if their husband was employed. Across Britain, there was a tendency for married women to join the labor force, competing for part-time jobs especially.\n\nIn rural and small-town areas, women expanded their operation of vegetable gardens to include as much food production as possible. In the United States, agricultural organizations sponsored programs to teach housewives how to optimize their gardens and to raise poultry for meat and eggs. In American cities, African American women quiltmakers enlarged their activities, promote collaboration, and trained neophytes. Quilts were created for practical use from various inexpensive materials and increased social interaction for women and promoted camaraderie and personal fulfillment.\n\nOral history provides evidence for how housewives in a modern industrial city handled shortages of money and resources. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat—and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid—extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans—to help cousins and in-laws.\n\nIn Japan, official government policy was deflationary and the opposite of Keynesian spending. Consequently, the government launched a nationwide campaign to induce households to reduce their consumption, focusing attention on spending by housewives.\n\nIn Germany, the government tried to reshape private household consumption under the Four-Year Plan of 1936 to achieve German economic self-sufficiency. The Nazi women's organizations, other propaganda agencies and the authorities all attempted to shape such consumption as economic self-sufficiency was needed to prepare for and to sustain the coming war. Using traditional values of thrift and healthy living, the organizations, propaganda agencies and authorities employed slogans that called up traditional values of thrift and healthy living. However, these efforts were only partly successful in changing the behavior of housewives.\n\nThe Hindu, Jewish, Sikh, Islamic and Christian views about women have varied throughout the last two millennia, evolving along with or counter to the societies in which people have lived. For much of history, the role of women in the life of the church, both local and universal, has been downplayed, overlooked, or simply denied.\n\nWarfare always engaged women as victims and objects of protection.\n\nThe First World War has received the most coverage, with the newest trend being coverage of a wide range of gender issues.\n\nDuring the twentieth century of total warfare the female half of the population played increasingly large roles as housewives, consumers, mothers, munitions workers, replacements for men in service, nurses, lovers, sex objects and emotional supporters. One result in many countries was women getting the right to vote, including the United States, Canada, Germany, and Russia, among others.\n\n\nThe following is a list of articles in Wikipedia (and outside links where Wikipedia has no relevant articles) which are either about women's history or containing relevant information, often in a \"History\" section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
