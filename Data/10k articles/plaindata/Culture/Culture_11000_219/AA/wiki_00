{"id": "563697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=563697", "title": "\"Master Harold\"...and the Boys", "text": "\"Master Harold\"...and the Boys\n\n\"Master Harold\"...and the boys is a play by Athol Fugard. Set in 1950, it was first produced at the Yale Repertory Theatre in March 1982 and made its premiere on Broadway on 4 May at the Lyceum Theatre, where it ran for 344 performances. The play takes place in South Africa during apartheid era, and depicts how institutionalized racism, bigotry or hatred can become absorbed by those who live under it. It is said to be a semi-autobiographical play, as Athol Fugard's birth name was Harold and his boyhood was very similar to Hally's, including his father being disabled, and his mother running a tea shop to support the family. His relationship with his family's servants was also similar to Hally's, as he sometimes considered them his friends, but other times treated them like subservient help, insisting that he be called \"Master Harold\", and once spitting in the face of one he had been close to.\n\nThe play was initially banned from production in South Africa. It was the first of Fugard's plays to premiere outside of South Africa.\n\nThe play recounts the long, rainy afternoon that Hally (\"Master Harold\") spends with Sam and Willie, two middle-aged African servants of his parent's household, in a tea shop owned by Hally's mother. Sam and Willie have cared for seventeen year old Hally his whole life.\n\nAt the start of the play Sam and Willie are practicing ballroom steps in preparation for a major competition, while maintaining the tea shop. Business is slow due to the rain. Sam is quickly revealed as being the more worldly of the two. When Willie, in broken English, describes his ballroom partner and girlfriend as lacking enthusiasm, Sam correctly diagnoses the problem: Willie beats her if she doesn't know the steps.\n\nHally then arrives home from school, and cheerfully asks if the two are ready for the competition. Sam is the unacknowledged yet de facto mentor to the boy since childhood, and has always treated Hally as his nephew/ward. Sam hopes to skillfully guide Hally through the difficult passage from childhood into manhood. And hopefully thereby, takes up those values and viewpoints of an adult; and a man, that Sam, has over the years lain down; and, that all men try to leave as their legacy of shepherding an adolescent boy into manhood. Willie, for his part, has always played the \"loyal black\"; who has always called the white Afrikaner boy (now young man) \"Master Harold\"; As if, as a man of forty-five, he was addressing a superior; even when Hally was six.\n\nThe conversation between the three moves from Hally's school-work, to an intellectual discussion on \"A Man of Magnitude\", where they mention various historical figures of the time and their contribution to society, to flashbacks of Hally, Sam and Willie when they lived in a Boarding House. Hally warmly remembers the simple act of flying a kite Sam had made for him out of junk; we later learn that Sam made it to cheer Hally up after he was embarrassed greatly by his father's public and continuing drunkenness. Conversation then turns to Hally's 500-word English composition. The play reaches an emotional apex as the beauty of the ballroom dancing floor (\"a world without collisions\") is used as a transcendent metaphor for life.\n\nAlmost immediately despair returns: Sam had early on mentioned why Hally's mother is not present; the hospital had called about his father, who has been there receiving treatment for complications from a leg he lost in World War II, to discharge him, and she had left to bring him home. However, Hally, indicating that his father had been in considerable pain the previous day, insisted that his father wasn't well enough to be discharged, and that the call must've been about a bad turn, rather than a discharge notice. A call from Hally's mother at the hospital confirms that Hally's father, is manipulating the hospital into discharging him, although he is indeed, not feeling any better than before, so it's still unofficial, and Hally remains hopeful that the discharge won't happen. A second call from Hally's mother later reveals that the discharge is official, and Hally's father is now home.\n\nHally is distraught about this news, since his father, who in addition to being crippled, is revealed to be a tyrannical alcoholic, and his being home will make home life unbearable with his drinking, fighting, and need for constant treatment, which includes demeaning tasks of having to massage his stump, and empty chamber pots of urine. Hally vents to his two black friends years of anger, and pain, viciously mocking his father and his condition. But when Sam chastises him for doing so, Hally, although ashamed of himself, turns on him, unleashing vicarious racism, that he learned from his father, creating possibly permanent rifts in his relationship with both Sam and Willie. For the first time, apart from hints throughout the play, Hally begins explicitly to treat Sam and Willie as subservient help rather than as friends or playmates, insisting that Sam call him \"Master Harold\" and spitting on him, among other things. Sam is hurt and angry and both he and Willie are just short of attacking Hally, but they both understand that Hally is really causing himself the most pain.\n\nThere is a glimmer of hope for reconciliation at the end, when Sam addresses Hally by his nickname again and asks to start over the next day, harkening back to the simple days of the kite. Hally, horrified about what he's done, is barely able to face Sam, responding without looking up \"It's still raining, Sam. You can't fly kites on rainy days, remember,\" then asks Willie to lock up the tea shop, and walks out into the rain, as Sam mentions that the bench Hally sat on as he flew the kite said \"Whites Only\" but Hally was too excited to notice it, and that he can (figuratively) leave it at any time. The play ends while Sam and Willie console each other by ballroom dancing together.\n\nJohn Simon, writing for New York Magazine, was measured in his review:\n\nFrank Rich of \"The New York Times\" praised the performance at the original Broadway premiere: \n\nThe principal casts of notable productions of \"Master Harold... and the Boys\"\n\nIvanek left to make the film \"The Sender\" in 1982, which is why he was replaced by Price.\n\nThe Afrikaans version was translated by Idil Sheard as \"Master Harold en die Boys\".\n\nFugard adapted the play for a television movie produced in 1985, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg with stars, Matthew Broderick, Zakes Mokae, and John Kani.\n\nA filmed version of the play was produced in South Africa in 2009 starring Freddie Highmore (\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", \"Finding Neverland\") as Hally and Ving Rhames (\"Pulp Fiction\", \"Mission Impossible 1–3\") as Sam. The film was directed by Lonny Price (who played Hally in the original Broadway cast) and produced by Zaheer Goodman-Bhyat, Mike Auret, Nelle Nugent and David Pupkewitz.\n\nSource: Playbill (vault)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57765273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57765273", "title": "Awake, our drowsy souls", "text": "Awake, our drowsy souls\n\n\"Awake, our drowsy souls\" was a Christian hymn by Elizabeth Scott. \n\nIt was first published in the Baptist \"Collections\" of Ash and Evans, Bristol, 1769, No. 307, in 5 stanzas of 6 1., and appointed as \"A hymn for Lord's Day Morning.\" From that collection it passed into several later hymnals, including John Rippon, John Dobell, and others. By the early 20th-century, it was almost entirely unknown to modern hymn-books except in the United States, having been superseded by \n\"Awake, ye saints, awake, And hail\", and others as a recast of the same in 4 stanzas (stanza iii. being the original with \"and\" for \"while,\" 1. 3) made by Thomas Cotterill, and given in the first edition of his \"Selection\", 1810. This form of the hymn had somewhat extensive use in Great Britain and the U.S., and is usually ascribed correctly to \"Elizabeth Scott and Thomas Cotterill.\"\n\nIn many of the modern American hymnals, stanza iv. is omitted; but the English generally give the text from Cotterill as in Baptist \"Psalms and Hymns\", 1858. In this case, the only alteration is \"blest \" for \"bless'd \" in stanza i., line 5. Another form of the hymn is:— \"Servants of God, awake.\" It consists of st. i.—iii- of Cotterill's recast, slightly altered. It appeared in the Harrow School \"Hymn Book\", 1855, and from then on passed into \"Church Hymns\", 1871, No. 39. In the \"Hymn-Book of the Evangelical Association\", Cleveland, Ohio, 1881, No. 604, stanzas i., ii. are given as \"Children of God, awake \"; and in the \"Marlborough College Hymns\", 1869, stanzas i.—iii. as \" Come, sons of God, awake.\"\n\nThe authorship of \"Awake, ye saints, awake\" is ascribed to Cotterill, on the ground that he wrote the most of what is its present form. In Caleb Evans’s \"Collection\", fifth edition, 1786, it appears in five stanzas, commencing, “Awake, our drowsy souls.\" Rippon has it with the same text and the same title: “A Hymn for the Lord’s Day Morning.\" Evans credits it to “D,” that is, Dr. Philip Doddridge, but Dobell, who reprints it in six stanzas, has assigned it to “Scott”. It was altered about the year 1810 by Cotterill, for his Sheffield collection. The original was discovered in manuscript, in the library of Yale College, where it remained. Professor Frederic Mayer Bird gave much care to Scott's biography and hymns, and elaborately annotated this manuscript volume in the columns of the \"New York Independent\".\n"}

{"id": "3742574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3742574", "title": "Berlin Trilogy", "text": "Berlin Trilogy\n\nThe Berlin Trilogy, or Berlin Triptych, consists of three consecutively released studio albums by English singer and songwriter David Bowie: \"Low\" (1977), \"\"Heroes\"\" (1977) and \"Lodger\" (1979). The albums were recorded after Bowie took up residence in West Berlin in late 1976, and saw him experiment with elements of electronic, krautrock, ambient, and world music in collaboration with American producer Tony Visconti and English musician Brian Eno.\n\nBowie began referring to the three albums as a Berlin-centered trilogy during the promotion of \"Lodger\", although \"Heroes\" was the only installment primarily recorded in the city. Each album reached the UK top five. Bowie would later call the music of the trilogy his \"DNA\". \"Consequence of Sound\" characterized the trilogy as an \"art rock trifecta\", while \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that the Berlin Trilogy \"stands as some of the most innovative music in the artist's influential canon\".\n\nFollowing Bowie's Thin White Duke period and the commercial success of the singles \"Fame\" and \"Golden Years\" in 1976, he was eager to escape the drug culture of Los Angeles, where he had developed a cocaine addiction. He had also become embroiled in controversy regarding comments he made seemingly in favour of fascism. He blamed his erratic behaviour on his addictions and precarious mental state, saying \"I was out of my mind, totally crazed.\" He called the period \"the darkest days of my life\" and confessed to having no memory of recording of \"Station to Station\" in Los Angeles in late 1975 due to his \"astronomic\" cocaine addiction. As his health deteriorated, Bowie attempted to reduce his cocaine intake and phase out the Thin White Duke persona, whom he had come to see as \"a nasty character indeed.\" He said: \"It was a dangerous period for me. I was at the end of my tether physically and emotionally and had serious doubts about my sanity.\"\nBowie moved to Switzerland in the second half of 1976. There, he began exploring other art forms and visiting galleries in Geneva and the Brücke Museum in Berlin, becoming (in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford) \"a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art ... Not only did he become a well-known patron of expressionist art, locked in Clos des Mésanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature, and started work on an autobiography.\" Later that year, Bowie, along with friend and singer Iggy Pop, retreated to Berlin in a further attempt to escape his addiction and the spotlight:\n\nFor many years Berlin had appealed to me as a sort of sanctuary-like situation. It was one of the few cities where I could move around in virtual anonymity. I was going broke; it was cheap to live. For some reason, Berliners just didn't care. Well, not about an English rock singer, anyway.\n\nWhile sharing an apartment with Pop, Bowie became interested in the German music scene, including acts such as Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk and Neu!. Before moving to the apartment on Hauptstraße, Pop and Bowie stayed with Edgar Froese of Tangerine Dream and his family at their home in Schöneberg. Froese also helped Bowie with his recovery and introduced him to the Berlin underground scene. Bowie named Froese's solo album \"Epsilon in Malaysian Pale\" a big influence and a soundtrack to his life in Berlin. During the months of his recovery, he had also become interested in Brian Eno's minimalist album \"Discreet Music\" (1975). He met Eno in 1976 and soon after began collaborations with Eno and producer Tony Visconti. In 1976, Bowie cowrote and produced Pop's solo album debut, \"The Idiot\" (1977). As work on the album started before Bowie's own \"Low\", Pop's \"The Idiot\" is often referred to as the unofficial beginning of Bowie's Berlin period, though the two albums were recorded almost concurrently.\n\nThe album \"Low\" (1977) was recorded as Bowie grappled with difficult personal issues, including a troubled marriage and drug dependence: \"There's oodles of pain in the \"Low\" album. That was my first attempt to kick cocaine, so that was an awful lot of pain. And I moved to Berlin to do it. I moved out of the coke centre of the world [\"i.e.\", Los Angeles] into the smack centre of the world. Thankfully, I didn't have a feeling for smack, so it wasn't a threat\". Visconti contended that the title was partly a reference to Bowie's \"low\" moods during the album's writing and recording. The album marked a movement for Bowie into electronic and ambient music. Side one of the album contained short, direct avant-pop song-fragments; side two comprised longer, mostly instrumental tracks. Often incorrectly given credit as \"Low\"s producer, Eno was responsible for a good deal of the direction and composition of the second side of the album and wrote the theme and instrumentation for \"Warszawa\" while Bowie was in Paris attending court hearings against his former manager. Partly influenced by the Krautrock sound of Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk and Neu!, \"Low\" evinced a move away from narration in Bowie's songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional. \n\n\"Low\" and \"The Idiot\" were mostly recorded in France, and of Bowie's trilogy only \"Low\" and \"Heroes\" were recorded at Hansa Studios in Berlin, nicknamed \"Hansa by the Wall\" for its proximity to the imposing structure that divided West from East Berlin. Although he completed the album in November 1976, it took his unsettled record company another three months to release it. It received considerable negative criticism upon its release—a release which RCA, anxious to maintain the established commercial momentum, did not welcome, and which Bowie's ex-manager, Tony Defries, who still maintained a significant financial interest in the singer's affairs, tried to prevent. Despite these forebodings, \"Low\" yielded the UK number three single \"Sound and Vision\", and its own performance surpassed that of \"Station to Station\" in the UK chart, where it reached number two.\n\nEchoing \"Low\"s minimalist, instrumental approach, the second of the trilogy, \"\"Heroes\"\" (1977), incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent, seeing Bowie joined by frequent Eno collaborator and King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp. Like \"Low\", \"Heroes\" evinced the zeitgeist of the Cold War, symbolised by the divided city of Berlin. Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators, synthesisers and koto, the album was another hit, reaching number three in the UK. Its title track, though only reaching number 24 in the UK singles chart, gained lasting popularity, and within months had been released in both German and French. Referencing the burgeoning new wave music scene, RCA Records marketed \"Heroes\" with the slogan \"There's Old Wave. There's New Wave. And there's David Bowie ...\"\n\nAfter releasing \"Heroes\" in 1977, Bowie spent much of 1978 on the Isolar II world tour, bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By now he had broken his drug addiction; biographer David Buckley writes that Isolar II was \"Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends.\" Recordings from the tour made up the live album \"Stage\", released the same year.\n\nIt was around the time of \"Lodger\" (1979) that Bowie began framing his previous two albums as the beginning of a Berlin-centered trilogy concluding with \"Lodger\", largely as a marketing technique to support the unusual new album. \"Lodger\", the final piece in what Bowie called his \"triptych\", eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of the other two, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. Recorded in Switzerland and New York, the result was a mixture of new wave and world music, in places incorporating Hijaz non-Western scales. Some tracks were composed using Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies cards: \"Boys Keep Swinging\" entailed band members swapping instruments, \"Move On\" used the chords from Bowie's early composition \"All the Young Dudes\" played backwards, and \"Red Money\" took backing tracks from \"Sister Midnight\", a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop. The album was recorded in Switzerland. Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman stated, \"It would be fair to call it Bowie's \"Sergeant Pepper\" ... a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology.\"\n\n\"Lodger\" initially received mixed reviews, and as described by biographer Christopher Sandford, \"The record dashed such high hopes with dubious choices, and production that spelt the end—for fifteen years—of Bowie's partnership with Eno.\" \"Lodger\" reached number 4 in the UK and number 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles \"Boys Keep Swinging\" (number 7 in the UK) and \n\"DJ\". Towards the end of the year, Bowie and his wife Angela initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980. By the early 1980s, Bowie would decamp to New York City.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51633122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51633122", "title": "Brilyante", "text": "Brilyante\n\nThe Brilyantes are fictional gemstones in the Filipino fantasy television series \"Encantadia\" as well as its 2016 requel. They are the elemental gems that holds the balance in Encantadia. Each gem manifests the classical elements: aether, fire, air, water, and earth. The tranquility and future of Encantadia rests on these gemstones.\nIn both series, each Brilyante are being carefully kept by each kingdom in Encantadia. The kingdom of fairies, Lireo, in the east of Encantadia, is the keeper of \"Brilyante ng Hangin\" (Gemstone of Air). Adamya, the kingdom of elves in the south is the keeper of \"Brilyante ng Tubig\" (Gemstone of Water). Sapiro, the northern kingdom of valiant warriors and healers, kept the \"Brilyante ng Lupa\" (Gemstone of Earth). Hathoria, the kingdom of proud and violent blacksmiths and orcs in the west, is the keeper the \"Brilyante ng Apoy\" (Gemstone of Fire). But after the Hathoria attempted to seize the all the gemstones, they are turned-over to Queen Mine-a of Lireo for safekeeping. Later, the four daughters of Queen Mine-a became the keeper of these gemstones.\n\nThe four \"brilyante\" first appeared in \"Encantadia\", but the history of the gemstones appeared on its prequel, \"Etheria\". The history of the four elemental gems date back to the First Great War in Encantadia with the fall of the Etherian Empire.\n\nThe four \"brilyantes\" were initially created as a single gem that the deity Emre, the highest god in Encantadia, bequethed to the leaders of each kingdom in Encantadia; it was called as the \"Brilyante ng mga Elemento\" (Gem of the Elements): King Bartimus of Hathoria, King Meno of Sapiro, Queen Cassiopeia of Lireo and Elder Aegen of Adamya, used it to aid them in their struggle against the abusive empire of Etheria (followers of the fallen snake deity, Ether) under the rule of Queen Avria. The gem contains the four elements that will keep the balance in Encantadia. After the fall of Etheria, the jewel was entrusted to the most stable nation at the time, Sapiro.\nFearful that the gem's power will corrupt Sapiro, Cassiopeia, the first Queen of Lireo, made the fateful decision and used the Kabilan Sword (the sword once belong to Etheria) to break the gem into four fragments that embodies the four elements it contain: water, fire, wind and earth. Because of this act, the four kingdoms of Encantadia lost their alliance with each other and Cassiopeia was cursed by Bathalang Emre and banished from Lireo. The four gem fragments were vested upon the four kingdoms. Sapiro was given the \"Brilyante ng Lupa\", Hathoria was given the \"Brilyante ng Apoy\", Lireo was given the \"Brilyante ng Hangin\", and Adamya was given the \"Brilyante ng Tubig\".\n\nKing Arvak of Hathoria, resentul of Cassiopeia's decision and deeply concerned by Hathoria's lack of apparent natural resources, launched a campaign of conquest throughout Encantadia, aided by his son and heir Hagorn. They successfully conquered Adamya and acquired the Brilyante ng Tubig, but were stopped cold when the Sapirians came to Adamya's rescue. Though successful in slaying King Armeo and acquiring the Brilyante ng Lupa, King Arvak died at the hands of Prince Raquim, and he then took the three gems.\nTo ensure its protection, Prince Raquim of Sapiro traveled to Lireo and took the three gems to the queen of the Diwatas (Fairies), Queen Mine-a's custody and guardianship of all four elemental jewels, assured that the powerful Lirean throne would never let the brilyante fall into Hathorian hands.\nThe \"brilyantes\" remained safe in Lireo until Sang'gre Pirena, the first-born of Mine-a, stole the \"Brilyante ng Apoy\" to aid her in defeating Mine-a during the challenge for the throne. Failing in her attempt and bitter of Minea's imagined favoritism, Pirena fled to Hathoria, carrying with her the Brilyante ng Apoy as bargaining chip with now King Hagorn. To protect the three remaining \"brilyantes\", Mine-a entrusted them to her three remaining children, Amihan (\"Brilyante ng Hangin\"), Alena (\"Brilyante ng Tubig\") and Danaya (\"Brilyante ng Lupa\").\n\nLike in the original series, the four gemstones were used to be a single gem called \"Inang Brilyante\" (Mother Gem). It was a glowing egg shaped diamond. It has all the powers of nature and is the only item in Encantadia that can fight the powers of a deity. The \"Inang Brilyante\" is protected by Cassiopeia in her island. Adhara, an evil \"diwata\", attempted to seize the \"Inang Brilyante\" for her personal ambitions, but she failed when Cassiopeia used the gem against her and destroyed her airship armada and sea fleet. To protect the \"Inang Brilyante\", Cassiopeia shattered it into the four elemental gems using the Kabilan, a god-sword previously owned by Queen Avria of the fallen Etherian empire. She gave each piece to Adamya, Hathoria, Sapiro and Lireo's respective rulers to prevent Adhara from acquiring them and to help ensure an era of peace in the land. However, Bathalang Emre did not like what Cassiopeia did so he cursed her with immortality and to serve as a seer. He also banished her from her kingdom, Lireo, and cannot set foot on her kingdom until the \"Inang Brilyante\" is whole again. \n\nAfter Pirena stole the \"Brilyante ng Apoy\" , Mine-a entrusted the three other ‘’brilyantes’’ to her other daughters, Amihan (\"Brilyante ng Hangin\"), Alena (\"Brilyante ng Tubig\") and Danaya (\"Brilyante ng Lupa\").\nIt was later revealed that there was a fifth gem, a diamond shaped clear quartz that was thrown to an island during the explosion when Cassiopeia cleaved the Mother Gem. It was later known as the \"Brilyante ng Diwa\" or the Soul Gem. It was discovered by a mortal child named Paopao that was abducted into Encantadia to become a slave. He became the first keeper of the said gem. \n\nAll brilyantes float and are all sentient meaning they all understand and have a connection with their current and sometimes former keepers. If the brilyante is not transferred to another keeper properly by its current dying wielder and was taken to the afterlife, the element is represents will slowly wither and disappear until it is retrieved from the afterlife. It can never be stolen and must be given willfully. The brilyantes can be \"stolen\" if the brilyante choses to go with its new keeper. All brilyantes can create a copy of itself with a fraction of the powers of the original.\n\nThe shapes of the \"brilyantes\" in the 2016 series changed from their shape in 2005 series. The \"Brilyante ng Apoy\" from diamond-shaped became a tear-shaped ruby, the \"Brilyante ng Hangin\" from being circular became sapphire shaped like a tornado, the \"Brilyante ng Tubig\" from being lens-shaped became a circular shaped emerald inspired by water ripples, and the \"Brilyante ng Lupa\" from being rectangular became an oval-shaped golden topaz. Another difference from the 2005 series is the presence of respective magic circles for each of the gems to show that the gem has accepted the current wielder as its keeper.\n\nKeeper of Fire Gem: \"Pirena\" – Deshna\n<br>The gem grants its keeper the power to control and conjure fire, enabling the person to control warmth/heat, temperature and light. In this sense, the beholder can intensify or withhold sunlight. This fire is sometimes used to create a portal window to see what other people are doing at the time. Fire can also be used as a container of power, knowledge and even souls/consciousness so that it may be kept or transferred to others. This gem has the ability of shapeshifting/glamouring into another person. Pirena used this ability many times. Her notable transformations are: Ades, Amihan, Aquil, Danaya, Lira, Ybrahim, Agane, Muros, Mira, Asval, Andora, and even the deities, Emre and Ether. It can also create a volcanic eruption with burning lava that can reach even the farthest place in Encantadia. It can also grant immunity to fire. It can also conjure a rain of fireballs. It can conjure a fire shield. It can let someone fly like a comet. When used with other gems, it can be used to enhance defense and deter attack for a whole kingdom. It can also locate others through body heat. This gem can give the ability to command all kinds of dragons. This gem is infamous for being used for evil. This gem chooses a keeper like Pirena and Deshna, with a scheming, manipultive, and wise personality. This gem is used by Pirena when she and Lira went to Avila.\n\nKeeper of Air Gem: \"Amihan\" – Ariana – Muyak\n<br>The gem grants its owner with the power to control the air, wind, weather, climate and coldness/ice. In this sense, the beholder can change air currents, conjure oxygen in areas without it or withhold oxygen to asphyxiate its victim, and transform into the air itself and become invisible (the ability to teleport using the wind known as \"ivictus\"). This gem is sometimes used to send messages to other people. It also grants the holder the ability to fly. The gem can also be employed in detecting the presence of nearby beings by tracing the sound of their breaths. It can also give the ability to see anything that is not physically present, such as objects, animals, ivtres (ghosts/spirits), or encantados. It can also give super-agility and super-speed. It can also grant levitation/telekinesis. It can also make an air shield. If combined with Brilyante ng Lupa, it can make a sandstorm. If combined with Brilyante ng Tubig, it can make a hailstorm. If combined with Brilyante ng Apoy, it can make a fire whirlwind. When used with other gems, it can be used to enhance defense and deter attack for a whole kingdom. It can also command all birds. This brilyante chooses a keeper with a noble heart and good intentions like Amihan, Ariana, and Muyak.\n\nKeeper of Water Gem: \"Alena\" – Mira – Armea\n<br>The gem grants its keeper with the power to control water and all kinds of liquids no matter its size (i.e. summoning a tsunami, storm). It enhances its keeper's strength and enables the person to control biosonar or sonokinesis, in this sense, it can be used to locate and can be used to hypotize others through a siren song. It can also command all aquatic flora and fauna. It also enables its keeper to summon rain/monsoon and portray an image and communicate through water. The keeper can also manipulate all body fluids. It can also give its wielder an aqua shield. It can make an aqua barrier to keep conversations secret. The gem could also wash away all memories. When used with other gems, it could grant blessings and protection. It can also grant its owner to shapeshift to any aquatic animal/plant like a turtle and water lily. This gem chooses someone with a romantic personality like Alena or Mira. \n\nKeeper of Earth Gem: \"Danaya\" – Lira – Cassandra\n<br>The gem grants its owner with earth-based powers, enabling the person to control the earth (including all geologic materials), vegetation, forests, mountains, and nature. In this sense, the beholder can conjure earthquakes (the magnitude varies to how the keeper wants the intensity to be. The keeper can also undo the damage caused by the earthquake), communicate and control all terrestrial plants and animals, shapeshift into any flora or fauna and heal herself and others (but not useful to injury that are self-inflicted or deadly). When used with other gems, it could grant blessings and protection. It can also make a shock wave. It can duplicate fake copies of itself. This gem chooses keepers with unquestionable loyalty and sturdy principles like Danaya and Lira.\n\nKeeper of the Soul Gem: Paopao\n<br>As the shard of the Mother Gem, it has all the secondary powers of all the other gems. It can throw energy balls like the fire gem, use \"ivictus\" like the air gem, locate others like the water gem, and heal others like the earth gem. When used with other gems, it could grant blessings and protection. It can also enhance defenses, agility and speed. It can also strengthen or weaken the soul of an individual. It can also make a force field. It can also conjure and command souls, as well as give the ability for astral projection and special sight for ivtres (ghosts). It can also make a force field. It alters the power of the other gem when used with it. The elemental symbol of the gem transforms back to its original Devas symbol from it was derived meaning, the fire gem could be used to control the emotions and transfer/transform energy, the water gem could be used to control the mind, the air gem could alter time and space and the earth gem could be used to create or put into being, give life and alter reality. This gem is innocent and goes to whoever it summons it unless it recognizes its past/present keeper. This gem is infamous for killing Hara Amihan and resurrecting Hara Avria.\n\nKeeper of the Gem: Emre \n<br>The sixth gemstone is a cube shaped amethyst used by Emre to tempt Lira with power, alongside with riches. It has no definite name. He said that the sixth gem has equal power to the first five gems. It has the power to balance nature. The first five gems are to create and maintain, the final gem is for destruction. Its powers is to balance all the works (the opposite) of all the other gems. Lira declined the gem and was kept until now by Emre. This is the only gem that is not part of the Inang Brilyante (Mother Gem).\n"}

This area covers approximately the modern-day countries of Greece, Cyprus, R. Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, southwestern Russia, and Georgia (known as the region of \"Eastern Orthodoxy in Europe\").\n\nThe most important treatment of the concept is a study by Dimitri Obolensky, \"The Byzantine Commonwealth\". In his book \"Six Byzantine Portraits\" he examined life and works of six persons mentioned in \"The Byzantine Commonwealth\". He also described the commonwealth as the international community within the sphere of authority of the Byzantine emperor, bound by the same profession of Eastern Christianity, and accepted the principles of the Romano-Byzantine law. \n\nThere are scholars, however, who criticize this conceptualization, disputing the notion of an unchallenged superiority of the Byzantine empire. It is argued that the complex and multi-faceted dynamics of documented cultural exchange was not aligned with the theory that Constantinople was the superior core while those in periphery understood their marginal position and merely imitated their superiors. Instead of Byzantine Commonwealth, historian Christian Raffensperger, proposed that it be recast as the \"Byzantine ideal\". Here, the empire maintains its belief in the traditional hierarchy and the imperial authority while its reach and sway were already considerably diminished. \n\n\n"}

It was won by Armenian grandmaster Levon Aronian. This was the second time he had won the Chess World Cup, 12 years after his first win in 2005.\n\nThe top two finishers in the tournament, Aronian and Ding Liren, qualified for the Candidates Tournament 2018 for the World Chess Championship 2018.\n\nAt the 85th FIDE Congress held during the 41st Chess Olympiad, FIDE received bids to host the World Cup 2017 and 2018 Olympiad from the national federations of Georgia and South Africa. South Africa proposed Sun City and Durban as venues, while Georgia proposed Tbilisi and Batumi respectively. Although Garry Kasparov expressed support for the South African bid during his FIDE presidential campaign, Georgia's bid won, receiving 93 votes to South Africa's 58.\n\nThe tournament is a knock-out, with the exception that there was a provision for the two semi-final losers to play off for third place if necessary (see #Candidates qualification).\n\nMatches consist of two regular time limit games (except for the final, and playoff for third if required, which consist of four regular time limit games). For these two games, players have 90 minutes for the first 40 moves followed by 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an increment of 30 seconds per move from the start of the game.\n\nIf a match is tied after the regular games, tie breaks will be played the next day. The format for the tie breaks is as follows:\n\nThe tournament qualified two players for the 2018 Candidates Tournament.\n\nHowever Magnus Carlsen (world champion) and Sergey Karjakin (already seeded to the Candidates) had no need for qualification, and both participated in the tournament (even though it is highly unusual for the defending champion to do so). So the rules were actually that the top two finishers other than Carlsen and Karjakin would qualify for the Candidates. This meant there was provision for a match for third place, between the two semi-final losers, if necessary.\n\nAs it turned out, both Carlsen and Karjakin were eliminated in the first three rounds, so the two Candidates qualifiers were simply the two finalists: Armenia's Levon Aronian and China's Ding Liren.\n\nEach of the first six rounds takes three days: one day each for the two regular time limit games, then a third day for tie breaks, if required. The final round has four days of regular time limit games, then a fifth day for tie breaks, if required.\n\nAll rounds begin at 15:00 local time (11:00 UTC).\n\nAccording to the regulations, all players have to pay their own expenses for travel, and 20% of each player's prize money goes to FIDE.\n\nThe participants are seeded by their FIDE rating of August 2017. All players are grandmasters unless indicated otherwise.\n\nShortly before the third-round game between Anton Kovalyov and Maxim Rodshtein was due to start, Kovalyov was questioned by the arbiter about the knee-length Bermuda shorts he was wearing, the same pair he wore in the first two rounds. Tournament organizer Zurab Azmaiparashvili then approached Kovalyov, stating that his attire violated the FIDE dress code and that he would be punished financially if he did not change what he was wearing. Kovalyov explained that he also wore shorts in the 2015 World Cup without incident, but Azmaiparashvili objected and said that Kovalyov's clothing made him \"look like a gypsy.\" Kovalyov interpreted this as a racial slur. Kovalyov then left the tournament hall and did not return, thus forfeiting the game. He also checked out of his hotel and booked a flight for Dallas, where he is studying for a master's degree in Computer Science technology at the University of Texas. The Chess Federation of Canada filed a formal complaint about the incident. FIDE issued a report on the incident on October 1.\n\n"}
{"id": "43349181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43349181", "title": "Civic technology", "text": "Civic technology\n\nCivic technology, or civic tech for short, is technology that enables engagement, participation or enhances the relationship between the people and government by enhancing citizen communications and public decision, improving government delivery of service, and infrastructure. It encompasses mainly information technology and includes civic applications, platforms supporting government bodies, institutions and other software that enables those goals. Civic technology has had increasing promise and importance with time. In the Information Age, digital communications have become the foundation for political and economic exchanges. As advanced technologies have become commonplace in society and available throughout the population, many local governments and officials have begun utilizing them for public outreach and feedback. Specifically, the Internet is being used more for communication between governing officials and citizens.\n\nThere are four different types of e-government services and civic technology falls within the category of government-to-citizen (or G2C), the other categories include government-to-business (G2B), government-to-government (G2G), and government-to-employees (G2E). \n\nA 2013 report from the Knight Foundation, an American non-profit, attempts to map different focuses within the civic technology space. It broadly categorizes civic technology projects into two categories: open government and community action.\n\nWithin the Knight Foundation, they \"care about ensuring that people have access to the news and information that they need to lead their lives in a democracy.\" They seek to establish a precedent of accessibility to information and the sharing of these sources for the common benefit of the people. With this accessibility, they enable for a more transparent, open system of sharing information for the benefit of more insightful, informed users and citizens that can engage more often in political and social matters that pertain to their concerns and to their lives.\n\nCitizens are also now given access to their representatives through social media. They are able to express their concerns directly to government officials through sites like Twitter and Facebook. There have even been past cases of online voting being a polling option for local elections, which have seen vastly increased turnouts, such as in an Arizona election in 2000 which saw a turnout double that of the previous election. It is asserted though that civic technology in government provides for a good management technique but lacks in providing fair democratic representation. Social media is also becoming a growing aspect of government, towards furthering the communication between the government and its citizenry and towards greater transparency within the governmental sectors. This innovation is facilitating a change towards a more progressive and open government, based on civic engagement and technology for the people. With social media as a communicating platform, it enables the government to provide information to the constituents and citizens on the legislative processes and what is occurring in the Congress, for the sake of the citizens' concerns with the government procedures.\n\nThe definition of what constitutes civic technology is contested to a certain extent, especially with regards to companies engaged in the sharing or access economy, such as Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb. For example, AirBnb's ability to provide New York residents with housing during the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy could be considered a form of civic technology. However, Nathaniel Heller, Managing Director of the Research for Development Institute's Governance Program contends that for-profit platforms definitively fall outside of the scope of civic technology: Heller has said that \"while citizen-to-citizen sharing is indeed involved, the mission of these companies is focused on maximizing profit for their investors, not any sort of experiment in building social capital.\" From a goal perspective, civic technology can be understood as “the use of technology for the public good”.\n\nMicrosoft's Technology & Civic Engagement Team have attempted to produce a precise taxonomy of civic technology through a bottom-up approach. They inventoried the existing initiatives and classified them according to:\nMicrosoft's Civic Graph is guiding the developing network of civic innovators, expanding \"its visualizations of funding, data usage, collaboration and even influence\" It is a new tool that is opening up the access to track the world of civic technology towards improving the credibility and progress of this sector. This graph will enable more opportunities for access by governmental institutions and corporations to discover these innovators and use them for progressing society towards the future of technology and civic engagement. To create an informed and insightful community, there needs to be a sense of civic engagement in this community, where there is the sharing of information through civic technology platforms and applications. \"Community engagement applied to public-interest technology requires that members of a community participate.\" With communal participation in civic tech platforms, this enables more informed residents to convene in a more engaged, unified community that seeks to share information, politically and socially, for the benefit of its citizenry and their concerns.This work resulted in a field guide.\n\nThe Technology & Civic Engagement Team have also produced a network visualization tool for civic technology organizations, Civic Graph.\n\nTechnology that is designed to benefit the citizenry places the governments under pressure \"to change and innovate the way in which their bureaucracies relate to citizens.\" E-government initiatives have been established and supported in order to strengthen the democratic values of governmental institutions, which can include Transparency, along with improving the efficiency of the legislative processes to make the government more accountable and reactive to citizens' concerns. These will further civic engagement within the political spectrum for the sake of greater Direct representation and a more democratic political system.\n\nA worldwide organization for civic tech is the Open Government Partnership (OGP). It “is a multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.” Created in 2011 by eight founding governments (Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, the Philippines, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States), the OGP gathers every year for a summit. Countries involved are located mainly in America (North and South), Europe and South-Asia (Indonesia, Australia, South Korea). Only a few African countries are part of the OGP, though South Africa is one of the founding countries.\n\nTechnological progress is rampant throughout the nations of the world, but there are dividing efforts and adoption techniques in how rapid certain countries are progressing compared to others. How countries are able to use information pertains to how devoted nations are to integrating technology into the lives of their citizens and businesses. Local and national governments are funding tens of billions of dollars towards information technology, for the sake of improving the functions and operations of this technology to work for the people and the governments. With more governments attaining a grasp on these technologies, it is paving the way towards more progressive and democratic political systems, for the concerns of future society and for those of the citizens of these nations.\n\nThe government of Burkina Faso has a government website portal offering citizens online information about the government structure, their constitution, and laws.\n\nLaunched in Kenya in 2014, \"MajiVoice\" is a joint initiative by the Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB- the Water Sector Regulator in Kenya) and the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program. As opposed to walk-in complaint centers, the initiative enables Kenyan citizens to report complaints with regards to water services via multiple channels of technology. The platform allows for communication between citizens and water service providers with the intention to improve service delivery in impoverished areas and user satisfaction. Users are given four options to report their water complaints. They can dial a number and report a complaint, send a text message (SMS) through their cell phone, or login to an online portal through a web browser on their phone or their laptop. One evaluation highlights the citizen engagement achieved after its implementation, from 400 complaints a month to 4000 complaints, and resolution rates from 46 percent to 94 percent\n\nThe South African government has a website portal for citizens called www.gov.za - this was created by Center for Public Service Innovation (CPSI) in partnership with the Department of Public Service and Administration and the State Information Technology Agency. The government portal allows the citizens to interact with their government and provide feedback, request forms online, as well as access online to laws and contact information for lawmakers.\n\nThe Ugandan government has a website portal created for citizens called Parliament Portal, which gives citizens online access to laws, their constitution, and election related news. \n\nU- Report, a mobile platform introduced by UNICEF Uganda in 2011, is an initiative that runs large scale polls with Ugandan youth on a wide range of issues, ranging from safety to access to education to inflation to early marriage. The goal of the initiative was to have Ugandan youth play a role in civic engagement within the context of local issues. U-Report is still active (as of April 2018), with over 240,000 users across Uganda. Support for the initiative primarily came from the aid of the government, NGO's, youth organizations, faith based organizations, and private companies. Users sign up for the program for free by sending a text on their phone, then every week \"U-Reporters\" answer a question regarding a public issue. Poll results are published in public media outlets such as newspapers, radio, etc. UNICEF takes these responses and provides members of parliament (MP's) a weekly review of these results, acting as a bridge between government and Ugandan youth.\n\nThe vTaiwan (v for virtual) was created initially by members of the open source community and later as a collaboration with the Taiwan's government. They use a conversation tool called pol.is that leverages machine learning to scale online discussion.\n\nIn Australia, a platform and proposed political party called MiVote has a mobile app for citizens to learn about policy and cast their vote for the policies they support. MiVote politicians elected to office would then vote in support of the majority position of the people using the app.\n\nIn 2002 MindLab, an innovation public sector service design group was established by the Danish ministries of Business and Growth, Employment, and Children and Education. MindLab was the one of the world's first public sector design innovation labs and their work inspired the proliferation of similar labs and user-centered design methodologies deployed in many countries worldwide. The design methods used at MindLab are typically an iterative approach of rapid prototyping and testing to evolve not just their government projects, but also government organizational structure using ethnographic-inspired user research, creative ideation processes, and visualization and modeling of service prototypes. In Denmark, design within the public sector has been applied to a variety of projects including rethinking Copenhagen's waste management, improving social interactions between convicts and guards in Danish prisons, transforming services in Odense for mentally disabled adults and more.\n\nIn 2013 the online platform People's Assembly (Rahvakogu) was launched for crowdsourcing ideas and proposals to amend Estonia's electoral laws, political party law, and other issues related to democracy.\n\nThe most dynamic French city regarding civic tech is Paris, with many initiatives moving in the Sentier, a neighborhood known for being a tech hub. According to Le Monde, French civic tech is “already a reality” but lacks investments to scale up.\n\nIn France, public data are available on data.gouv.fr by the Etalab mission, located under the authority of the Prime Minister.\n\nGovernment agencies are also leading large citizen consultation through the Conseil national du numérique (National digital council), for example with the law about the digital republic (Projet de loi pour une république numérique).\n\nThe French citizen community for civic tech is gathered in the collective Démocratie ouverte (Open democracy). The main purpose of this collective is to enhance democracy to increase citizen power, improve the way to decide collectively and update the political system. Démocratie ouverte gathers many projects focused on understanding politics, renewing institutions, participating in democracy, and public action.\nSeveral open-source, non-profit web platforms have been launched nationwide to support citizen's direct involvement: Communecter.org, Demodyne.org as well as Democracy OS France (derived from the Argentinian initiative).\n\nLaPrimaire.org organizes open primaries to allow the French to choose the candidates they wish to run for public elections\n\nThe Icelandic constitutional reform, 2010–13 instituted a process for reviewing and redrafting their constitution after the 2008 financial crisis, using social media to gather feedback on twelve successive drafts.\n\nBeginning in October 2011, a Citizens Foundation platform called Betri Reykjavik had been implemented for citizens to inform each other and vote on issues. Each month the city council formally evaluates the top proposals before issuing an official response to each participant. As of 2017, the number of proposals approved by the city council reached 769.\n\nThe Pirate Party (Iceland) uses the crowdsourcing platform Píratar for members to create party policies.\n\nA consortium made by TOP-IX, FBK and RENA created the Italian civic tech school.\n\nThe first edition was in May 2016 in Turin.\n\nThe Five Star Movement has a tool called Rousseau which gives members a way to communicate with their representatives.\n\nThe Madrid City Council has a department of Citizen Participation that facilitates a platform called Decide Madrid for registered users to discuss topics with others in the city, propose actions for the City Council, and submit ideas for how to spend a portion of the budget on projects voted on through participatory budgeting.\n\nPodemos (Spanish political party) uses a reddit called Plaza Podemos where anybody can propose and vote on ideas.\n\nThe City of Stockholm has a make-a-suggestion page on stockholm.se and available as an app, allowing citizens to report any ideas for improvement in the city along with a photo and GPS. After receiving a suggestion, it is sent to the appropriate office that can place a work order. During 2016, one hundred thousand requests were recorded. This e-service began in September 2013.\n\nThe city government of Gothenburg has an online participatory voting system, open for every citizen to propose changes and solutions. When a proposal receives more than 200 votes, it is delivered to the relevant political committee.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008 documents from the British government explore the concept of \"user-driven public services\" and scenarios of highly personalized public services. The documents proposed a new view on the role of service providers and users in the development of new and highly customized public services, utilizing user involvement. This view has been explored through an initiative in the UK. Under the influence of the European Union, the possibilities of service design for the public sector are being researched, picked up, and promoted in countries such as Belgium.\n\nCare Opinion was set up to strengthen the voice of patients in the NHS in 2005. Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) (also known as Nudge) was originally part of the UK cabinet and was founded in 2010, in order to apply nudge theory to try to improve UK government policy, services and save money. As of 2014, BIT became a decentralized, semi-privatized company with Nesta (charity), BIT employees and the UK government each owning a third of this new business. That same year a Nudge unit was added to the United States government under president Obama, referred to as the ‘US Nudge Unit,’ working within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nFixmyStreet.com is a website and app developed by mySociety, a UK based civic technology company that works to make online democracy tools for UK citizens. FixmyStreet allows citizens in the United Kingdom to report public infrastructure issues (such as potholes, broken streetlights, etc.) to the proper local authority. FixmyStreet became inspiration to many countries around the world that followed suit to use civic technology to better public infrastructure. The website was funded by the Department for Constitutional Affairs Innovation fund and created by mySociety. Along with the platform itself, mySociety released FixmyStreet, a free and open-source software framework that allows users to create their own website to report street problems. mySociety has many different tools, like parliamentary monitoring ones, that work in many countries for different types of governance. When such tools are integrated into government systems, citizens can not only understand the inner workings of their now transparent government, but also have the means to \"exert influence over the people in power\". Newspeak House is a community space and venue focused on building a community of civic and political technology practitioners in the United Kingdom. \n\nSpacehive is a crowdfunding platform for civic improvement projects that allows citizens and local groups to propose project ideas such as improving a local park or starting a street market. Projects are then funding by a mix of citizens, companies and government bodies. The platform is used by several councils including the Mayor of London to co-fund projects.\n\nIn Ukraine, major civic tech movement started out with open data reform in 2014. As for now, public data are available on data.gov.ua, national open data portal.\n\nSome widely used Ukrainian civic tech projects are donor recruitment platform DonorUA, Ukrainian companies' data and court register monitoring service Open Data Bot, participatory budgeting platform \"Громадський проект\". The latter accounts for over 3 million users.\n\nIn 2017, to foster the growth of civic tech initiatives, Ukrainian NGO SocialBoost launched 1991 Civic Tech Center, a dedicated community space in country's capital, Kyiv. The space opened following a $480,000 grant from Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment firm established by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.\n\nCanadian Digital Service (CDS) was launched in 2017, as part of an attempt to bring better IT to the Canadian government. The CDS was established within the Treasury Board of Canada the Canadian agency that oversees spending within departments and the operations of the public service. Scott Brison, the president of the Canadian Treasury Board, launched CDS and was Canada’s first minister of digital government.\n\nAs in other countries, the Canadian civic technology movement is home to several organizations. Code for Canada is a non-profit group, following somewhat the model of Code for America. Several cities or regions host civic technology groups with regular meetings (in order from West to East): Edmonton, Waterloo Region, Toronto, Ottawa and Fredericton.\n\nThe Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations sought initiatives to further openness of the government, through either increased use of technology in political institutions or efficient ways to further civic engagement. The Obama administration pursued an Open Government Initiative based on principles of transparency and civic engagement. This strategy has paved the way for increased governmental transparency within other nations to improve democratically for the citizens' benefit and allow for greater participation within politics from a citizen's perspective. During his run for president, Obama was \"tied directly to the extensive use of social media by the campaign.\" \n\nAccording to a study conducted by the International Data Corporation (IDC), an estimated $6.4 billion will be spent on civic technology in 2015 out of approximately $25.5 billion that governments in the United States will spend on external-facing technology projects. A Knight Foundation survey of the civic technology field found that the number of civic technology companies grew by roughly 23% annually between 2008 and 2013.\n\nCivic technology is built by a variety of companies, organizations and volunteer groups. One prominent example is Code for America, a not-for-profit based in San Francisco, working toward addressing the gap between the government and citizens. College students from Harvard University created the national non-profit Coding it Forward that creates data science and technology internships for undergraduate and graduate students in United States federal agencies. Another example of a civic technology organization is the Chi Hack Night, based in Chicago. The Chi Hack Night is a weekly, volunteer-run event for building, sharing and learning about civic technology. Civic Hall is a coworking and event space in New York City for people who want to contribute to civic-minded projects using technology. And OpenGov creates software designed to enable public agencies to make data-driven decisions, improve budgeting and planning, and inform elected officials and citizens.\n\nOneBusAway, a mobile app that displays real-time transit info, exemplifies the open data use of civic technology. It is maintained by volunteers and has the civic utility of helping people navigate their way through cities. It follows the idea that technology can be a tool for which government can act as a society-equalizer.\n\nWithin the Mexican president’s office, there is a national digital strategy coordinator who works on Mexico's national digital strategy. The office has created the gob.mx portal, a website designed for Mexican citizen to engage with their government, as well as a system to share open government data. According to McKinsey & Company, in a 2018 survey Mexico had the worst-rated citizen experience (4.4 out of 10) for convenience and accessibility of Mexican government services, of the group of countries surveyed (Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States).\n\nArena Electoral was an online platform created by Fundación Ethos during the Mexican electoral process of 2012 to promote responsible voting. An online simulation was created by taking the four presidential candidates in that election cycle and each were given policy issues based on the Mexican national agenda that they had to come up with a solution to. Once each candidate gave their solutions, the platform published it on their website and left it to the Mexican citizens to vote for the best policy.\n\nPartido de la Red (Net Party) is an Argentinean political party using the DemocracyOS open-source software with the goal of electing representatives who vote according to what citizens decides online.\n\nBecause of the conveniences provided by civic technology, there are benefits as well as growing concern about the effects it may have on social behavior and civic engagement. New technology allows for connectivity and new communications, as well as changing how we interact with issues and contexts beyond one's intimate sphere. Civic technology affords transparency in government with open-government data, and allows more people of diverse socioeconomic levels to be able to build and engage with civic matters in a way that was not possible prior.\n\nThe importance of face-to-face interactions has also been called to question with the increase in e-mails and social media and a decrease in traditional, in-person social interaction. Technology as a whole may be responsible for this change in social norm, but it also holds potential for turning it around with audio and video communication capabilities. More research needs to be conducted in order to determine if these are appropriate substitutes for in-person interaction, or if any substitute is even feasible.\n\nPreece & Shneiderman discuss the important social aspect of civic technology with a discussion of the \"reader-to-leader framework\", which follows that users inform readers, who inform communicators, who then inform collaborators, before finally reaching leaders. This chain of communication allows for the interests of the masses to be communicated to the implementers.\n\nRegarding elections and online polling, there is the potential for voters to make less informed decisions because of the ease of voting. Although many more voters will turn out, they may only be doing so because it is easy and may not be consciously making a decision based on their own synthesized opinion. It's suggested that if online voting becomes more common, so should constituent-led discussions regarding the issues or candidates being polled.\n\nWith advanced technologies coming at higher costs and with an increased reliance on civic technologies may leave low-income families in the dark if they cannot afford the platforms for civic technology, such as computers and tablets. This causes an increase in the gap between lower and middle/high socioeconomic class families.\n\nKnowledge of how to use computers is equally important when considering factors of accessing civic technology applications online, and is also generally lower in low-income households. Public Schools have taken the lead in ensuring proper technology access and education in the classroom to better prepare children for the high-tech world, but there is still a clear difference between online contributions from those with and without experience on the internet.\n\nAs the field of civic technology advances further through the coming years it seems as though apps and handheld devices will become a key focus for development as more companies and municipalities reach out to developers to help with specific issues. Apps are being used in conjunction with hand held devices to make life easier. Tasks such as communication, data tracking, and safety are just a few of the topics app developers and communities have tried to make easier. The cheapest way for citizens to get help and information is through neighbors and others around them. By linking people through apps and websites that harbor conversation and promote civil service cities have found an inexpensive way to provide services to its people.\n\nAs civic technology is \"just a piece of the $25.5 billion that government spends on external information technology (IT),\" it is not difficult to see how this sector will grow from here on out towards fostering more innovation in the public and private sectors and towards furthering civic engagement within these sectors and with these platforms of technology.\n\nCivic hacking is a technological approach to solving civic problems, often involving the use of government data to make governments more accountable. Civic hackers can be programmers, designers, data scientists, good communicators, civic organizers, entrepreneurs and government employees. Some civic hackers are employed by nonprofits, such as Code for America and projects such as mySociety work at the intersection of civic technology and hacktivism. Some work for innovative for-profit companies, such as the geospatial software provider Azavea in Philadelphia. Others are civic hackers only by night.\n\nCode for America is a non-partisan, non-political 501(c)(3) organization founded in 2009 to address the widening gap between the public and private sectors in their effective use of technology and design. The organization believes that for the U.S. government to truly serve the people in the 21st century, it must do three things:\n\nmySociety is an e-democracy project of the UK-based registered charity named UK Citizens Online Democracy. It began as a UK-focused organisation with the aim of making online democracy tools for UK citizens.\n\nPrinceton University Professor Andrew Appel set out to prove how easy it was to hack into a voting machine. He and a graduate student, Alex Halderman, purchased a voting machine, and Halderman picked the lock in 7 seconds. They removed the 4 ROM chips and replaced them with modified versions of their own: a version of modified firmware that could throw off the machine's results, subtly altering the tally of votes, never to betray a hint to the voter. It took less than 7 minutes to complete the process.\n\nAppel wrote a testimony for the Congress House Subcommittee on Information Technology hearing on “Cybersecurity: Ensuring the Integrity of the Ballot Box”, suggesting to for Congress to eliminate touchscreen voting machines after the election of 2016, and that it require all elections be subject to sensible auditing after every election to ensure that the systems are functioning properly and to prove to the American people that their votes are counted as cast.\n\n\n"}

Comedian Zane Lamprey hosts a humorous bus trip around the United States and Canada, exploring the local drinking culture of various cities in the countries. In each episode, Lamprey samples popular or original cocktails and beers from bars and breweries in the area.\n\nSeason two premiered with an hour long episode on October 5, 2011, on HDNet.\n\nEach episode begins with an overview of the highlights of the episode. Throughout the show Zane and his friend Steve McKenna visit popular bars, breweries, and distilleries where they sample different offerings from the establishments. At bars, Zane is typically behind the bar interviewing the bartender, as well as making cocktails with the help of the bartender. At some point during the episode, McKenna (and sometimes Lamprey) will engage in an eating challenge where he attempts to eat a large portion of a signature dish from a restaurant in the area. Sometimes McKenna is trying to set a record at the restaurant, othertimes he and Zane are racing to finish first or eat the most.\n\nAnother segment found only in season one is an interview led by Marc Ryan. He typically visits a brewery or distillery on his own, and tries to learn the history and story of the business, as well as sample what they produce.\n\nZane and Steve hold a competition in each episode called the \"Six Six-Pack Challenge\" where Lamprey and McKenna face off in some sort of game and bet each other six six-packs on the outcome. The games are usually inspired by the location of the episode or the bars they visit.\n\n\nThe show also doubles as a drinking game, introduced after the first commercial break in each episode. The rules are as follows:\n\n\nIn each episode Zane challenges Steve to an eating contest. This usually involves Steve trying to finish a restaurant's specialty or Zane racing Steve to eat the most of a certain food. The eating challenges were discontinued after the first season. Zane said the reason for this was because he had always won them, which made it unfair for Steve.\n\nIn each episode Zane and Steve challenge each other to a contest. The winner gets six six-packs. Marc always chooses a side before the game begins.\n\nIn season two, the challenge was changed to simply the \"Six Pack Challenge\".\n\nThe first episode of Season 3 aired on October 3, 2012 at 8pm eastern time. The episodes were:\n\n\nAccording to the official website of the show, \"Due to the re-branding of AXS TV and despite the overwhelming support of the fans, Drinking Made Easy will not be continuing with a 4th season on AXS TV. While there is still a chance that the show could be picked up by other networks, Zane and the rest of the crew decided to use this opportunity to return to an international format through the new show Chug. Most of the crew of Drinking Made Easy will continue on with the new project and even crew from Three Sheets, like Executive Producer, Mike Kelly, will be joining the team. \"\n\n"}

In this respect they differ slightly from the medical definition, which defines entoptic phenomena as only applying to sources within the eye, not the brain. To avoid this confusion, the term subjective visual phenomena is sometimes used. \"Entoptic\" was chosen by author David Lewis Williams due to its origin from Greek meaning \"coming from within\".\n\nThere has been a great deal of work trying to find evidence of motifs and compositions derived from entoptic phenomena in prehistoric art, especially rock art and megalithic art. The justification of this research is that entoptic phenomena normally occur during states of altered consciousness, the practice of which may impact our views of ancient religious and social practice. The importance of looking outside traditional methods of research for interpreting prehistoric cultures is made more so due to the lack of abundant data which makes current cultural studies viable. \"Art and the ability to comprehend it are more dependent on kinds of mental imagery and the ability to manipulate mental images than on intelligence.\"\n\nExperiences include geometric visual patterns such as dots, zagging lines, as well as grid patterns which are all common shapes which are universally understood by the human condition. These patterns and shapes can be seen without aid of psychotropic substances but under their influence the heightened effects precipitate modes of altered consciousness. Entoptic experiences differ from hallucinations in that they are a purely visual phenomenon, while hallucinations represent experience of culturally occurring themes as well as physical coming from the five senses.\n\nEntoptic Phenomena are interpreted in ways that can be understood, matched to objects or ideas that may be familiar in day-to-day life and may also be attributed to the individuals state such as hunger, sexual arousal, or anxiety and fear. Placing objects in reality from base shapes seen under influence from pscychotropics which link to somatic physical responses lead now to full hallucinations. The relation between the first stage entoptic image and later stage full hallucinations are not mutually exclusive, both may be present.\n\nStage 3 images become iconic, relating to themes from the subjects life and become linked to powerful emotional experiences. Metaphor and simile give way to the belief that objects are exactly what they appear to be \"subject losing insight into the differences between literal and analogical meanings\" These stages may not always be sequential, and all stages may not be experienced depending on the subject and of course the type of psychotropic being used.\n\nWilliams notes that altered states are and their resulting impact on human consciousness is often marginalized within state, scientific, and religious realms. \"The contemporary Western emphasis on the supreme value of intelligence has tended to suppress certain forms of consciousness and to regard them as irrational, marginal,aberrant or even pathological and thereby to eliminate them from investigations of the deep past.\" As with any well rounded approach to cultural or historical study, all aspects of the human condition must be explored, especially when such exploration takes us outside of our usual cultural perspective.\n\n\n"}

She attended the Nashville Female Academy. Her three brothers and father enlisted in the Confederate Army at the start of the American Civil War. Her father, Joel Allen Battle, started a company in Nolensville, called the \"Zollicoffer Guards.\" It eventually became the 20th Tennessee Infantry and Battle became captain. He would eventually serve as a Colonel. He was a prisoner of war and two of Battle's brothers were killed in the Battle of Shiloh. \n\nBattle joined the Confederacy as a spy when the Union Army occupied Nashville in March 1862. She joined alongside her sister-in-law, Harriet Booker. Battle entered Nashville with a fake Federal pass, traveling in and out of the city, gathering information about the Union Army's work in the area and smuggling medicine and other supplies out of the city. On April 7, 1863, Battle and Booker were arrested for smuggling and holding fake Federal passes. They were first detained at the Tennessee State Penitentiary and then they were moved to Camp Chase in Ohio. Shortly thereafter, they were transferred to the Old Capitol Prison in Washington, D.C., where five other female Confederate spies were held. \n\nBattle and Booker were released on May 13, 1863 in City Point, Virginia. Battle returned to Nashville and started teaching at Howard School. She taught math, geography and spelling throughout Nashville until 1886.\n\nIn December 1881, the Cumberland River flooded. Battle met with Nashville leadership and organized the Nashville Relief Society to help poor flood victims living in flood zones near the river. Over 1,000 people were provided clothing, food and coal. As a result, Battle worked with other local leaders to create United Charities. The organization struggled to secure funding to hire an executive director. Therefore, Battle quit her job teaching in 1886 and served as the nonprofit's secretary-general, a position she would hold until her death in 1924. \n\nDuring her work with United Charities, Battle created a daycare program for the children of working parents. She rented a room in a neighborhood in North Nashville, located near cotton mills that employed women mill workers. Physicians and other professionals provided pro bono services to the growing number of children in the program. Eventually, the program was named the Addison Avenue Day Home, the first daycare in Nashville. Today, it is named the Fannie Battle Day Home for Children. \n\nIn 1900, Battle created a summer camp for low-income mothers and their children. Located in Craggie Hope, it was named the Fresh Air Camp. \n\nSixteen years later, Battle created a fundraising campaign for the Day Home, during which carolers would perform during the Christmas holiday.\n\nBattle died in September 1924. Memorial services were held at McKendree United Methodist Church. She was buried at Mt. Olivet Cemetery. \n\nAfter Battle's death, the Addison Avenue Day Home was renamed the Fannie Battle Day Home for Children. In 1947, Battle's service in the Confederate Army was memorialized with a plaque at the Confederate Museum. The archives of Battle, and a portrait of her, are held in the Nashville Public Library. \n\n"}
{"id": "30864687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30864687", "title": "Feminisation of the workplace", "text": "Feminisation of the workplace\n\nThe feminization of the workplace is a set of social theories that seek to explain occupational sex segregation.\n\nFeminization of the work industry is the pressure created from the cultural turn where the issues of fairness, opportunity and redistribution in society overcome economic inequalities and find more balance to combat income inequality, social exclusion and cultural imperialism. The issues of sexual differences, gender roles and employment and services inequalities are questioned, abandoned and demolished. Feminization of the workplace links to the Marxist approach where everyone has the ability to sell their labor power to own the means of production. This approach allows women to work in jobs with flexible and family-friendly working hours because of their childcare responsibilities.\n\nThe feminization in the workplace destabilized the occupational segregation in society.\n\nWomen are tackling any forms of profession and feminizing labor forces that were restricted and dominated by men. From exporting personal labor, entering the labor market, challenging the field of science and engineering, and participating in sports environment, the power and role of women in the society have dramatically changed.\n\nFeminization of survival is a term that feminists use to describe a social condition where women are forced into inhumane conditions for the survival of themselves and their families. \n\nIn 1888, the government of Canada decided to invite skilled Chinese men to work in The Gold Rush and the Canadian Pacific Railway to reduce the cost of labor wages and to make these projects affordable. They were motivated by desires to leave China and to earn higher wages. Although these immigrants were earning a higher compensation in Canada compared to China, they experienced exclusion and occupational inequality. Even though the issue of racial exclusion is currently desensitized, there are workers who encounter violence and abuse in their working environment and a majority of them are women. Exporting labor to developed countries is still booming since it creates economic growth and diversity. The globalization of labor eases the government debts and unemployment rates of developing countries. Women, especially in Southeast Asian countries, are attracted to this money making opportunity.\n\nThe mostly poor and low-wage women were often considered burdens rather than resources, but now an increasing number of women are earning a profit and securing government revenues. Several developing countries in Southeast Asia, especially the Philippines, have seen the emergence of exporting labor to developed countries due to high foreign debt and unemployment. Filipino women working overseas in the United States of America have sent home almost $8 billion a year in 2003 and most of these women tackle the fields of health care, domestic service and child care. Filipina Overseas workers have earned the title of \"migrant heroism\" for sacrificing themselves away from the family and to normalize migration remittance-sending to their motherland. Not only do these women hold a higher responsibility in their family and country, but they are faced with racialization, violence and abuse.\n\nIn the new era, women restricted the 'spatial reach' of their job searches due to childcare responsibilities. The open employment for middle class women catalyzes the growing use of domestic workers for household cleaning and childcare. There has been a complexity in the modern economics with women's responsibility at home and at work. Cultural theories maintain that lower wages in female-dominated occupations are the product of societal bias against the work typically carried out by women and that the sex-composition of occupations affects wages directly. In contrast, recent human capital theories maintain that the wage-penalties associated with working in female-dominated occupations result from different requirements in specialized training and that the effect is indirect. Many feminist scholars insist that sexual difference is the primary reason for differences between both sexes in the labor market outcomes.\n\nWomen face discrimination in the workplace, such as the “glass ceiling,” female participation in the labor market has increased markedly during the past 20 years. However, even with the increased participation in the labor force and the high levels of commitment women give to their workplace, women’s work is still undervalued. Additionally, many times a woman’s work schedule is structured in such a way that it conflicts with her care giving responsibilities. The women who are also union members at work feel “side-lined” and “downgraded” about the workplace issues they face that are apart from the union’s agenda. Furthermore, high levels of unionization strongly correlates with a lower wage gap as well as lower gender gap. One way in which people have tried to help working women is through legislation. In late 2003, Norway passed a law that advocated for 40% of representation of gender public board companies. The main objective for this was to increase the representation of women in top positions in the top sector and decrease gender disparity. The result, however, had very little impact on women in business, especially those who made it into corporate sectors.\n\nDespite these setbacks, women have been performing their jobs well. Women make up almost half, 40.9%, of the American workforce, and they are CEOs of some of the best companies such as PepsiCo, Archer Daniels Midland, and W.L. Gore. Women also earn almost 60% of the university degrees from America and Europe. They make up the majority of the professional workers in many countries, for example, 51% in the United States. Even with this high percentage, women’s earnings are far less than what men are paid on average. They are also intensely under-represented at the top of their organizations. Surprisingly, feminization of the workplace has been driven by the relentless drive of the service sector and the equal decline of manufacturing. More women than ever before are willing to work outside their homes. Even after having children, 74% of women in the workforce managed to return to work, and 40% returned to their full-time jobs.\n\nAccording to the American Association of University Women, young boys' and girls' capabilities and interests in science, mathematics and engineering are equally well; however, most girls begin to lose their interest in their high school years because of the gender gap science and engineering is perceived. As a result, women are underrepresented in science-related occupations due to the gendered interactions early in life. Researches claim that the segregation of men and women into different occupations is the principal reason for earnings differences between men and women. They argue that occupational segregation restricts people's choice of career. Researchers also observed both gender's general behaviors that can represent preferred profession and they found the boys are encouraged (and assumed) to be outgoing, analytic, and aggressive, while girls are encouraged (and assumed) to be passive, dependent, and nurturing.\n\nIn the last quarter century, increasing involvement of women and minorities has prevented a severe shortage of science and engineering workers; but if current rates of gender and ethnic participation in these bachelor's degree programs do not change, the number of qualified workers will soon be inadequate to meet the science, technology, and engineering needs of our society.\n\nThere is an under-representation of women in the STEM fields. According to a study done by the U.S. Department of Commerce, in the United States women account for approximately twenty-four percent of the STEM workforce, while making up forty-eight percent of the overall workforce. There are a variety of factors that contribute to this discrepancy such as lack of female role models, gender stereotyping and sexism in hiring. The roots of under-representation being in grade school, where girls fall behind boys in math because they are lead to believe they are not as smart as boys, and therefore incapable of being good at math. Other influences include teachers, family, culture, stereotypes and role models throughout school. Women are earning the same number of bachelor degrees as men, but only account for thirty percent of STEM degrees. Women who earn these degrees are more likely to go into healthcare or education rather than STEM professions.\n\nThe wage gap with in STEM jobs is smaller than in non-STEM jobs. Women earn thirty-five percent more than females in non-stem careers. They also earn more than men with non-STEM jobs. Female engineering majors match their male counterparts in number who go into the engineering occupation, but physical and life sciences majors turned toward a broader range of careers outside STEM. Within these career fields there is a pattern of sexist hiring that leads to less women being hired in these fields. The lack of women in these fields create a cold work environment, which causes women to quit. In the life sciences, women are earning more doctorates than men, but only one third are hired as associate professors after completing their PhD, but once hired they are more likely to prosper in the STEM profession. Women who have a family are more likely to switch to a non-STEM major or work fewer hours than men in the same fields.\n\nIn the United States, women were seen as 'ill-equipped' to participate in sports, and their involvement was viewed as unfeminine and undesirable. The reasons why women experience less academic advantage from sports than do men focus on the clash between the expectations for women, athletes and the stigma for female athletes who are seen to be unfeminine.\n\nToday, women represent forty-one percent of high school athletes and thirty-seven percent of college athletes. Increasing numbers of women are participating in sport at the professional level as well. The passage of Title IX sparked the increase in women participating in sports throughout high school and college in the United States. Title IX of the 1972 Educational Amendments prohibits discrimination based on gender to any educational program receiving federal funding. Since the passage of Title IX, women in collegiate sports has increased dramatically. In 1981 the number of women participating in collegiate sports was 74,329 and by 2001 that number increased to 150,916. In addition women have increased from only making up about twenty-five percent of the student athlete population to forty-two percent. Before 1972 and the passage of Title IX, women were, for the most part, absent from sports in high school. In 1972 only one in twenty seven women participated in high school sports, but by 1998 that statistic became one in three. Following the passage of Title IX the number of girls participating in athletics rose from 294,015 to 817,073. After only six years that number increased even more to over two million girls getting involved in high school sports. Prior to 1972 girls only made up seven percent of student athletes and that number rose to thirty-two percent in 1978. This was a momentous time for women in sports because there was finally more representation across the board. Compared to women, one in two males participate in high school sports.\n\nAfter the passing of Title IX, the number of women managing and coaching sports in general has decreased. The number of women in administrative positions within sports declined seventeen percent from 1972-1987. It was also found that in Texas schools women only made up six percent of the athletic directors and in Florida only thirteen percent were women. In addition to administrative positions, women coaches have seen a significant decline after Title IX was passed. In 1973, women coaches were at an all time high of around eighty percent, but over the next ten years that number rapidly declined to around forty percent despite the increasing opportunities for women. Ever since Title IX was passed, women head coaches have been harder and harder to find especially from 1977-1982 when there was a thirty-six percent decrease. This issue has still not improved much since the 1972, even though Title IX was implemented to prevent this from happening.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2203410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203410", "title": "Genetic relationship (linguistics)", "text": "Genetic relationship (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, genetic relationship is the usual term for the relationship which exists between languages that are members of the same language family. The term genealogical relationship is sometimes used to avoid confusion with the unrelated use of the term in biological genetics. Languages that possess genetic ties with one another belong to the same linguistic grouping, known as a language family. These ties are established through use of the comparative method of linguistic analysis.\n\nTwo languages are considered to be genetically related if one is descended from the other or if both are descended from a common ancestor. For example, Italian is descended from Latin. Italian and Latin are therefore said to be genetically related. Spanish is also descended from Latin. Therefore, Spanish and Italian are genetically related. In a similar way, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian are genetically related through the North Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.\n\nThe classification of languages into language families begins by making a list of words in the potential languages that exhibit lexical and grammatical similarities; that is, they are similar in sound and meaning. The next step is to determine how the similarities originated. There are three possibilities: convergence, borrowing and common origin. Convergence is the chance similarity of sound and meaning of a word in two different languages and \"is based on the principle that a word is an arbitrary association of sound and meaning\". An example of convergence is that many unrelated languages have words similar to \"mama\" and \"papa\" for 'mother' and 'father'. Borrowing results from the exchanging of words between languages in close contact with one another. Once convergence and borrowing have been eliminated as possible explanations for similarities in sound and meaning of words, the last explanation is common origin. It can be assumed that the similarities occurred due to descent from a common ancestor, and the words are known as cognates. The set of all cognates of a word is the etymology of the word.\n\nWhen languages are in contact with one another, either of them may influence the other through linguistic interference such as borrowing. For example, French has influenced English, Arabic has influenced Persian, and Chinese has influenced Japanese in this way. However, such influence does not constitute (and is not a measure of) a genetic relationship between the languages concerned. Linguistic interference can occur between languages that are genetically closely related, between languages that are distantly related (like English and French, which are distantly related Indo-European languages) and between languages that have no genetic relationship.\n\nOne theory concerning genetic relationships among languages is monogenesisthe idea that all known languages, with the exceptions of creoles, pidgins and sign languages, are descendant from a single ancestral language.\n\nA common visual representation of a language family is given by a genetic language tree. The tree model is sometimes termed a dendrogram or phylogeny. The family tree shows the relationship of the languages within in a family, much as a family tree of an individual shows their relationship with their relatives. There are criticisms to the family tree model. Critics focus mainly on the claim that the internal structure of the trees is subject to variation based on the criteria of classification. Even among those who support the family tree model, there are debates over which languages should be included in a language family. For example, within the dubious Altaic language family, there are debates over whether the Japonic and Koreanic languages should be included or not.\n\nThe wave model has been proposed as an alternative to the tree model. The wave model uses isoglosses to group language varieties; unlike in the tree model, these groups can overlap. While the tree model implies a lack of contact between languages after derivation from an ancestral form, the wave model emphasizes the relationship between languages that remain in contact, which is more realistic.\n\nSome problems encountered by the genetic relationship group of languages include language isolates and mixed, pidgin and creole languages. Mixed languages, pidgins and creole languages constitute special genetic types of languages. They do not descend linearly or directly from a single language and have no single ancestor. Language isolates are languages that are unrelated to other languages. Each language isolate is considered to be a single language family with one language according to the \"Ethnologue\". Including language isolates when counting language families considerably increases the number of language families.\n\n"}

Proceeds from the comic went to the American Friends Service Committee, to assist in their work on behalf of African famine relief and recovery. Published in the form of a \"comic jam,\" or exquisite corpse, the book featured an all-star lineup of comics creators as well as a few notable authors from outside the comic book industry, such as Stephen King, George R. R. Martin, and Edward Bryant. It also saw a rare Alan Moore Marvel Comics credit outside his early Marvel UK work.\n\n\"Heroes for Hope\" featured some memorable artist/writer and penciler/inker pairings, including Stan Lee and John Buscema; Stephen King and Bernie Wrightson; Moore and Richard Corben; Harlan Ellison, Frank Miller, and Bill Sienkiewicz; Mike Baron and Steve Rude, Howard Chaykin inked by Walt Simonson; and John Byrne and Terry Austin reuniting on the X-Men.\n\n\"Heroes for Hope\" came about in response to the devastating 1983–85 famine in Ethiopia. The concept was in the spirit of contemporaneous musical fund-raisers like Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", USA for Africa's \"We Are the World\", and the Live Aid concerts. Then-Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Jim Shooter described the genesis of the project this way:\n\nIn addition to the contributors donating their work for the project, so did logo designer Janet Jackson and Marvel's production staff; while Curtis Circulation Company and all the direct market distributors and comics specialty shops donated their profits.\n\nThe comic book opens with Rachel Summers poking her head out of the X-Mansion to grab the mail, only to be confronted with a horrible sight. The X-Men rush to the entrance to see that the mansion has somehow been transported to the middle of a barren desert.\n\nAfter retrieving the comatose mail carrier, Wolverine senses that all is not right, and claws him in the face. But it turns out that it was all an illusion. The X-Men go back to business as usual after this fiasco, but then things begin to go wrong. One by one, a series of psychic assaults is launched on each member of the team, as they are subjected to their greatest subconscious fears.\n\nFirst Colossus (with art by Byrne and Austin) is mocked by steely apparitions of his teammates. This is more than he can bear, and he curls up in a fetal position. Kitty Pryde, as told by King, Wrightson, and inker Jeff Jones, goes to grab something from the refrigerator only to be surprised by an evil Death-type being in a cloak. He exposes Kitty's great fear of going hungry. As told by Bill Mantlo, Charles Vess, and Jon J Muth, Nightcrawler finds Kitty turned into a wizened old hag, which leads to his own experience, focusing on Christian imagery and moral dilemmas. Kurt is offered the chance to sacrifice himself so that one other person might breath the air and eat the food he would. He declines, and thinks himself a coward. Thanks to Moore and Richard Corben, the next to fall prey to the spiritual onslaught is Magneto, who is offered a glimpse of a world where his dream of mutant supremacy has been realized — and that it's not all it's cracked up to be. Rachel is swept back to her past, where she's confronted by a horde of mutant-hunting doppelgänger Hounds, reminding her of her part in that dystopian future. Wolverine, by Ellison, Miller, and inker Sienkiewicz, must confront the tension between his human and animal sides. Claremont, Brian Bolland, and P. Craig Russell depict Storm confronted by a carnival ringmaster, who traps her in a house of mirrors. She is shown various images of her possible self, each one more distorted than the last. Ororo gets drawn into the crazy carnival games, and in the first concrete expression of the story's theme, she realizes that it is wrong to waste food. Having defeated the psychic attacker by feeding illusory cream pies to illusory people, Storm returns to her teammates for discussion of what has transpired.\n\nCourtesy of Rachel's powers, the X-Men track the psychic presence that's been harassing them to the continent of Africa. They fly the Blackbird to the source, where they are met with horrible scenes of deprivation. Before long, a fleet of C-130 Hercules transport aircraft arrive, full of supplies, which the X-Men help distribute.\n\nThat night, Rogue becomes so frustrated that she has not had her turn of psychic punishment yet that she decides to hunt down the entity herself. She sneaks around the campsite stealing her teammates' powers. Using the psychic powers of Rachel Summers, the Rogue hybrid traces the presence of the X-Men's harasser to a desert hideaway. Upon entering the crypt, Rogue is attacked by the avatar of the psychic being. Things are not going well for Rogue when Storm appears to give aid. The \"entity\" is revealed to be a primeval god-force that feeds on human despair. One by one, the X-Men awake from their Rogue-induced comas and join in the battle.\n\nThe X-Men finally defeat the entity and return to their campsite, where they resume the enormous task of feeding the starving refugees. They realize their battle with the entity was a metaphor for the fight against famine, and indeed any human struggle. Kitty expresses fear that the entity survived the battle and is ready to strike again, but Wolverine comforts her with words of hope.\n\n\"Heroes for Hope\" featured a story by Chris Claremont, Ann Nocenti, Bernie Wrightson, Jim Starlin, and Jim Shooter. The editors were Nocenti and Claremont; the assistant editors were Pat Blevins and Terry Kavanagh. Front cover by Arthur Adams; back cover by Starlin.

{"id": "13677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13677", "title": "Hindu", "text": "Hindu\n\nHindu () refers to any person who regards themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism. It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe historical meaning of the term \"Hindu\" has evolved with time. Starting with the Persian and Greek references to the land of the Indus in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era, the term Hindu implied a geographic, ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent around or beyond the Sindhu (Indus) river. By the 16th century, the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims.\n\nThe historical development of Hindu self-identity within the local South Asian population, in a religious or cultural sense, is unclear. Competing theories state that Hindu identity developed in the British colonial era, or that it developed post-8th century CE after the Islamic invasion and medieval Hindu-Muslim wars. A sense of Hindu identity and the term \"Hindu\" appears in some texts dated between the 13th and 18th century in Sanskrit and regional languages. The 14th- and 18th-century Indian poets such as Vidyapati, Kabir and Eknath used the phrase \"Hindu dharma\" (Hinduism) and contrasted it with \"Turaka dharma\" (Islam). The Christian friar Sebastiao Manrique used the term 'Hindu' in religious context in 1649. In the 18th century, the European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of Indian religions collectively as \"Hindus\", in contrast to \"Mohamedans\" for Mughals and Arabs following Islam. By the mid-19th century, colonial orientalist texts further distinguished Hindus from Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains, but the colonial laws continued to consider all of them to be within the scope of the term \"Hindu\" until about mid-20th century. Scholars state that the custom of distinguishing between Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs is a modern phenomenon. Hindoo is an archaic spelling variant, whose use today may be considered derogatory.\nAt more than 1.03 billion, Hindus are the world's third largest group after Christians and Muslims. The vast majority of Hindus, approximately 966 million, live in India, according to India's 2011 census. After India, the next 9 countries with the largest Hindu populations are, in decreasing order: Nepal, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, United States, Malaysia, United Kingdom and Myanmar. These together accounted for 99% of the world's Hindu population, and the remaining nations of the world together had about 6 million Hindus in 2010.\n\nThe word \"Hindu\" is derived from the Indo-Aryan and Sanskrit word \"Sindhu\", which means \"a large body of water\", covering \"river, ocean\". It was used as the name of the Indus river and also referred to its tributaries. The actual term \" first occurs, states Gavin Flood, as \"a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: \"Sindhu\")\", more specifically in the 6th-century BCE inscription of Darius I. The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhu in the Vedas, is called \"Hapta Hindu\" in Zend Avesta. The 6th-century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of \"Hi[n]dush\", referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as \"Hinduvān\" (Hindus) and \"hindavī\" was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text \"Chachnama\". The term 'Hindu' in these ancient records is an ethno-geographical term and did not refer to a religion. The Arabic equivalent \"Al-Hind\" likewise referred to the country of India.\n\nAmong the earliest known records of 'Hindu' with connotations of religion may be in the 7th-century CE Chinese text \"Record of the Western Regions\" by the Buddhist scholar Xuanzang. Xuanzang uses the transliterated term \"In-tu\" whose \"connotation overflows in the religious\" according to Arvind Sharma. While Xuanzang suggested that the term refers to the country named after the moon, another Buddhist scholar I-tsing contradicted the conclusion saying that \"In-tu\" was not a common name for the country.\n\nAl-Biruni's 11th-century text \"Tarikh Al-Hind\", and the texts of the Delhi Sultanate period use the term 'Hindu', where it includes all non-Islamic people such as Buddhists, and retains the ambiguity of being \"a region or a religion\". The 'Hindu' community occurs as the amorphous 'Other' of the Muslim community in the court chronicles, according to Romila Thapar. Wilfred Cantwell Smith notes that 'Hindu' retained its geographical reference initially: 'Indian', 'indigenous, local', virtually 'native'. Slowly, the Indian groups themselves started using the term, differentiating themselves and their \"traditional ways\" from those of the invaders.\nThe text \"Prithviraj Raso\", by Chanda Baradai, about the 1192 CE defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan at the hands of Muhammad Ghori, is full of references to \"Hindus\" and \"Turks\", and at one stage, says \"both the religions have drawn their curved swords;\" however, the date of this text is unclear and considered by most scholars to be more recent. In Islamic literature, 'Abd al-Malik Isami's Persian work, \"Futuhu's-salatin\", composed in the Deccan in 1350, uses the word \" to mean Indian in the ethno-geographical sense and the word \" to mean 'Hindu' in the sense of a follower of the Hindu religion\". The poet Vidyapati's poem \"Kirtilata\" contrasts the cultures of Hindus and Turks (Muslims) in a city and concludes \"The Hindus and the Turks live close together; Each makes fun of the other's religion (\"dhamme\").\" One of the earliest uses of word 'Hindu' in religious context in a European language (Spanish), was the publication in 1649 by Sebastiao Manrique.\n\nOther prominent mentions of 'Hindu' include the epigraphical inscriptions from Andhra Pradesh kingdoms who battled military expansion of Muslim dynasties in the 14th century, where the word 'Hindu' partly implies a religious identity in contrast to 'Turks' or Islamic religious identity. The term \"Hindu\" was later used occasionally in some Sanskrit texts such as the later Rajataranginis of Kashmir (Hinduka, c. 1450) and some 16th- to 18th-century Bengali Gaudiya Vaishnava texts, including \"Chaitanya Charitamrita\" and \"Chaitanya Bhagavata\". These texts used it to contrast Hindus from Muslims who are called Yavanas (foreigners) or Mlecchas (barbarians), with the 16th-century \"Chaitanya Charitamrita\" text and the 17th-century \"Bhakta Mala\" text using the phrase \"Hindu dharma\".\n\nOne of the earliest but ambiguous uses of the word Hindu is, states Arvind Sharma, in the 'Brahmanabad settlement' which Muhammad ibn Qasim made with non-Muslims after the Arab invasion of northwestern Sindh region of India, in 712 CE. The term 'Hindu' meant people who were non-Muslims, and it included Buddhists of the region. In the 11th-century text of Al Biruni, Hindus are referred to as \"religious antagonists\" to Islam, as those who believe in rebirth, presents them to hold a diversity of beliefs, and seems to oscillate between Hindus holding a centralist and pluralist religious views. In the texts of Delhi Sultanate era, states Sharma, the term Hindu remains ambiguous on whether it means people of a region or religion, giving the example of Ibn Battuta's explanation of the name \"Hindu Kush\" for a mountain range in Afghanistan. It was so called, wrote Ibn Battuta, because many Indian slaves died there of snow cold, as they were marched across that mountain range. The term \"Hindu\" there is ambivalent and could mean geographical region or religion.\n\nThe term Hindu appears in the texts from the Mughal Empire era. It broadly refers to non-Muslims. Pashaura Singh states, \"in Persian writings, Sikhs were regarded as Hindu in the sense of non-Muslim Indians\". Jahangir, for example, called the Sikh Guru Arjan a Hindu:\n\nDuring the colonial era, the term Hindu had connotations of native religions of India, that is religions other than Christianity and Islam. In early colonial era Anglo-Hindu laws and British India court system, the term Hindu referred to people of all Indian religions and two non-Indian religions:\n\nThe 20th-century colonial laws of British India segregated people's rights by their religion, evolving to provide Muslims with Sharia law, Christians, Jews and Parsis of British India with their own religious laws. The British government created a compendium of religious laws for Hindus, and the term 'Hindu' in these colonial 'Hindu laws', decades before India's independence, applied to Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs.\n\nBeyond the stipulations of British law, colonial orientalists and particularly the influential Asiatick Researches founded in the 18th century, later called The Asiatic Society, initially identified just two religions in India – Islam, and Hinduism. These orientalists included all Indian religions such as Buddhism as a subgroup of Hinduism in the 18th century. These texts called followers of Islam as \"Mohamedans\", and all others as \"Hindus\". The text, by the early 19th century, began dividing Hindus into separate groups, for chronology studies of the various beliefs. Among the earliest terms to emerge were \"Seeks and their College\" (later spelled Sikhs by Charles Wilkins), \"Boudhism\" (later spelled Buddhism), and in the 9th volume of Asiatick Researches report on religions in India, the term \"Jainism\" received notice.\n\nAccording to Pennington, the terms Hindu and Hinduism were thus constructed for colonial studies of India. The various sub-divisions and separation of subgroup terms were assumed to be result of \"communal conflict\", and Hindu was constructed by these orientalists to imply people who adhered to \"ancient default oppressive religious substratum of India\", states Pennington. Followers of other Indian religions so identified were later referred Buddhists, Sikhs or Jains and distinguished from Hindus, in an antagonistic two-dimensional manner, with Hindus and Hinduism stereotyped as irrational traditional and others as rational reform religions. However, these mid-19th-century reports offered no indication of doctrinal or ritual differences between Hindu and Buddhist, or other newly constructed religious identities. These colonial studies, states Pennigton, \"puzzled endlessly about the Hindus and intensely scrutinized them, but did not interrogate and avoided reporting the practices and religion of Mughal and Arabs in South Asia\", and often relied on Muslim scholars to characterise Hindus.\n\nIn contemporary era, the term Hindus are individuals who identify with one or more aspects of Hinduism, whether they are practising or non-practicing or \"Laissez-faire\". The term does not include those who identify with other Indian religions such as Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism or various animist tribal religions found in India such as \"Sarnaism\". The term Hindu, in contemporary parlance, includes people who accept themselves as culturally or ethnically Hindu rather than with a fixed set of religious beliefs within Hinduism. One need not be religious in the minimal sense, states Julius Lipner, to be accepted as Hindu by Hindus, or to describe oneself as Hindu.\n\nHindus subscribe to a diversity of ideas on spirituality and traditions, but have no ecclesiastical order, no unquestionable religious authorities, no governing body, nor a single founding prophet; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist. Because of the wide range of traditions and ideas covered by the term Hinduism, arriving at a comprehensive definition is difficult. The religion \"defies our desire to define and categorize it\". A Hindu may, by his or her choice, draw upon ideas of other Indian or non-Indian religious thought as a resource, follow or evolve his or her personal beliefs, and still identify as a Hindu.\n\nIn 1995, Chief Justice P. B. Gajendragadkar was quoted in an Indian Supreme Court ruling:\n\nAlthough Hinduism contains a broad range of philosophies, Hindus share philosophical concepts, such as but not limiting to dharma, karma, kama, artha, moksha and samsara, even if each subscribes to a diversity of views. Hindus also have shared texts such as the Vedas with embedded Upanishads, and common ritual grammar (Sanskara (rite of passage)) such as rituals during a wedding or when a baby is born or cremation rituals. Some Hindus go on pilgrimage to shared sites they consider spiritually significant, practice one or more forms of bhakti or puja, celebrate mythology and epics, major festivals, love and respect for guru and family, and other cultural traditions. A Hindu could:\n\nIn the Constitution of India, the word \"Hindu\" has been used in some places to denote persons professing any of these religions: Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism or Sikhism. This however has been challenged by the Sikhs and by neo-Buddhists who were formerly Hindus. According to Sheen and Boyle, Jains have not objected to being covered by personal laws termed under 'Hindu', but Indian courts have acknowledged that Jainism is a distinct religion.\n\nThe Republic of India is in the peculiar situation that the Supreme Court of India has repeatedly been called upon to define \"Hinduism\" because the Constitution of India, while it prohibits \"discrimination of any citizen\" on grounds of religion in article 15, article 30 foresees special rights for \"All minorities, whether based on religion or language\". As a consequence, religious groups have an interest in being recognised as distinct from the Hindu majority in order to qualify as a \"religious minority\". Thus, the Supreme Court was forced to consider the question whether Jainism is part of Hinduism in 2005 and 2006.\n\nStarting after the 10th century and particularly after the 12th century Islamic invasion, states Sheldon Pollock, the political response fused with the Indic religious culture and doctrines. Temples dedicated to deity Rama were built from north to south India, and textual records as well as hagiographic inscriptions began comparing the Hindu epic of Ramayana to regional kings and their response to Islamic attacks. The Yadava king of Devagiri named \"Ramacandra\", for example states Pollock, is described in a 13th-century record as, \"How is this Rama to be described.. who freed Varanasi from the \"mleccha\" (barbarian, Turk Muslim) horde, and built there a golden temple of Sarngadhara\". Pollock notes that the Yadava king \"Ramacandra\" is described as a devotee of deity Shiva (Shaivism), yet his political achievements and temple construction sponsorship in Varanasi, far from his kingdom's location in the Deccan region, is described in the historical records in Vaishnavism terms of Rama, a deity Vishnu avatar. Pollock presents many such examples and suggests an emerging Hindu political identity that was grounded in the Hindu religious text of Ramayana, one that has continued into the modern times, and suggests that this historic process began with the arrival of Islam in India.\n\nBrajadulal Chattopadhyaya has questioned the Pollock theory and presented textual and inscriptional evidence. According to Chattopadhyaya, the Hindu identity and religious response to Islamic invasion and wars developed in different kingdoms, such as wars between Islamic Sultanates and the Vijayanagara kingdom (Karnataka), and Islamic raids on the kingdoms in Tamil Nadu. These wars were described not just using the mythical story of Rama from Ramayana, states Chattopadhyaya, the medieval records used a wide range of religious symbolism and myths that are now considered as part of Hindu literature. This emergence of religious with political terminology began with the first Muslim invasion of Sindh in the 8th century CE, and intensified 13th century onwards. The 14th-century Sanskrit text, \"Madhuravijayam\", a memoir written by \"Gangadevi\", the wife of Vijayanagara prince, for example describes the consequences of war using religious terms,\n\nThe historiographic writings in Telugu language from the 13th- and 14th-century Kakatiya dynasty period presents a similar \"alien other (Turk)\" and \"self-identity (Hindu)\" contrast. Chattopadhyaya, and other scholars, state that the military and political campaign during the medieval era wars in Deccan peninsula of India, and in the north India, were no longer a quest for sovereignty, they embodied a political and religious animosity against the \"otherness of Islam\", and this began the historical process of Hindu identity formation.\n\nAndrew Nicholson, in his review of scholarship on Hindu identity history, states that the vernacular literature of Bhakti movement sants from 15th to 17th century, such as Kabir, Anantadas, Eknath, Vidyapati, suggests that distinct religious identities, between Hindus and Turks (Muslims), had formed during these centuries. The poetry of this period contrasts Hindu and Islamic identities, states Nicholson, and the literature vilifies the Muslims coupled with a \"distinct sense of a Hindu religious identity\".\n\nScholars state that Hindu, Buddhist and Jain identities are retrospectively-introduced modern constructions. Inscriptional evidence from the 8th century onwards, in regions such as South India, suggests that medieval era India, at both elite and folk religious practices level, likely had a \"shared religious culture\", and their collective identities were \"multiple, layered and fuzzy\". Even among Hinduism denominations such as Shaivism and Vaishnavism, the Hindu identities, states Leslie Orr, lacked \"firm definitions and clear boundaries\".\n\nOverlaps in Jain-Hindu identities have included Jains worshipping Hindu deities, intermarriages between Jains and Hindus, and medieval era Jain temples featuring Hindu religious icons and sculpture. Beyond India, on Java island of Indonesia, historical records attest to marriages between Hindus and Buddhists, medieval era temple architecture and sculptures that simultaneously incorporate Hindu and Buddhist themes, where Hinduism and Buddhism merged and functioned as \"two separate paths within one overall system\", according to Ann Kenney and other scholars. Similarly, there is an organic relation of Sikhs to Hindus, states Zaehner, both in religious thought and their communities, and virtually all Sikhs' ancestors were Hindus. Marriages between Sikhs and Hindus, particularly among \"Khatris\", were frequent. Some Hindu families brought up a son as a Sikh, and some Hindus view Sikhism as a tradition within Hinduism, even though the Sikh faith is a distinct religion.\n\nJulius Lipner states that the custom of distinguishing between Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs is a modern phenomena, but one that is a convenient abstraction. Distinguishing Indian traditions is a fairly recent practice, states Lipner, and is the result of \"not only Western preconceptions about the nature of religion in general and of religion in India in particular, but also with the political awareness that has arisen in India\" in its people and a result of Western influence during its colonial history.\n\nScholars such as Fleming and Eck state that the post-Epic era literature from the 1st millennium CE amply demonstrate that there was a historic concept of the Indian subcontinent as a sacred geography, where the sacredness was a shared set of religious ideas. For example, the twelve \"Jyotirlingas\" of Shaivism and fifty-one \"Shaktipithas\" of Shaktism are described in the early medieval era Puranas as pilgrimage sites around a theme. This sacred geography and Shaiva temples with same iconography, shared themes, motifs and embedded legends are found across India, from the Himalayas to hills of South India, from Ellora Caves to Varanasi by about the middle of 1st millennium. Shakti temples, dated to a few centuries later, are verifiable across the subcontinent. Varanasi as a sacred pilgrimage site is documented in the \"Varanasimahatmya\" text embedded inside the \"Skanda Purana\", and the oldest versions of this text are dated to 6th to 8th-century CE.\n\nThe idea of twelve sacred sites in Shiva Hindu tradition spread across the Indian subcontinent appears not only in the medieval era temples but also in copper plate inscriptions and temple seals discovered in different sites. According to Bhardwaj, non-Hindu texts such as the memoirs of Chinese Buddhist and Persian Muslim travellers attest to the existence and significance of the pilgrimage to sacred geography among Hindus by later 1st millennium CE.\n\nAccording to Fleming, those who question whether the term Hindu and Hinduism are a modern construction in a religious context present their arguments based on some texts that have survived into the modern era, either of Islamic courts or of literature published by Western missionaries or colonial-era Indologists aiming for a reasonable construction of history. However, the existence of non-textual evidence such as cave temples separated by thousands of kilometers, as well as lists of medieval era pilgrimage sites, is evidence of a shared sacred geography and existence of a community that was self-aware of shared religious premises and landscape. Further, it is a norm in evolving cultures that there is a gap between the \"lived and historical realities\" of a religious tradition and the emergence of related \"textual authorities\". The tradition and temples likely existed well before the medieval era Hindu manuscripts appeared that describe them and the sacred geography. This, states Fleming, is apparent given the sophistication of the architecture and the sacred sites along with the variance in the versions of the Puranic literature. According to Diana L. Eck and other Indologists such as André Wink, Muslim invaders were aware of Hindu sacred geography such as Mathura, Ujjain, and Varanasi by the 11th-century. These sites became a target of their serial attacks in the centuries that followed.\n\nThe Hindus have been persecuted during the medieval and modern era. The medieval persecution included waves of plunder, killing, destruction of temples and enslavement by Turk-Mongol Muslim armies from central Asia. This is documented in Islamic literature such as those relating to 8th century Muhammad bin-Qasim, 11th century Mahmud of Ghazni, the Persian traveler Al Biruni, the 14th century Islamic army invasion led by Timur, and various Sunni Islamic rulers of the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire. There were occasional exceptions such as Akbar who stopped the persecution of Hindus, and occasional severe persecution such as under Aurangzeb, who destroyed temples, forcibly converted non-Muslims to Islam and banned the celebration of Hindu festivals such as Holi and Diwali.\n\nOther recorded persecution of Hindus include those under the reign of 18th century Tipu Sultan in south India, and during the colonial era. In the modern era, religious persecution of Hindus have been reported outside India.\n\nChristophe Jaffrelot states that modern Hindu nationalism was born in Maharashtra, in the 1920s, as a reaction to the Islamic Khilafat Movement wherein Indian Muslims championed and took the cause of the Turkish Ottoman sultan as the Caliph of all Muslims, at the end of the World War I. Hindus viewed this development as one of divided loyalties of Indian Muslim population, of pan-Islamic hegemony, and questioned whether Indian Muslims were a part of an inclusive anti-colonial Indian nationalism. The Hindu nationalism ideology that emerged, states Jeffrelot, was codified by Savarkar while he was a political prisoner of the British colonial empire.\n\nChris Bayly traces the roots of Hindu nationalism to the Hindu identity and political independence achieved by the Maratha confederacy, that overthrew the Islamic Mughal empire in large parts of India, allowing Hindus the freedom to pursue any of their diverse religious beliefs and restored Hindu holy places such as Varanasi. A few scholars view Hindu mobilisation and consequent nationalism to have emerged in the 19th century as a response to British colonialism by Indian nationalists and neo-Hinduism gurus. Jaffrelot states that the efforts of Christian missionaries and Islamic proselytizers, during the British colonial era, each of whom tried to gain new converts to their own religion, by stereotyping and stigmatising Hindus to an identity of being inferior and superstitious, contributed to Hindus re-asserting their spiritual heritage and counter cross examining Islam and Christianity, forming organisations such as the \"Hindu Sabhas\" (Hindu associations), and ultimately a Hindu-identity driven nationalism in the 1920s.\n\nThe colonial era Hindu revivalism and mobilisation, along with Hindu nationalism, states Peter van der Veer, was primarily a reaction to and competition with Muslim separatism and Muslim nationalism. The successes of each side fed the fears of the other, leading to the growth of Hindu nationalism and Muslim nationalism in the Indian subcontinent. In the 20th century, the sense of religious nationalism grew in India, states van der Veer, but only Muslim nationalism succeeded with the formation of the West and East Pakistan (later split into Pakistan and Bangladesh), as \"an Islamic state\" upon independence. Religious riots and social trauma followed as millions of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs moved out of the newly created Islamic states and resettled into the Hindu-majority post-British India. After the separation of India and Pakistan in 1947, the Hindu nationalism movement developed the concept of Hindutva in second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe Hindu nationalism movement has sought to reform Indian laws, that critics say attempts to impose Hindu values on India's Islamic minority. Gerald Larson states, for example, that Hindu nationalists have sought a uniform civil code, where all citizens are subject to the same laws, everyone has equal civil rights, and individual rights do not depend on the individual's religion. In contrast, opponents of Hindu nationalists remark that eliminating religious law from India poses a threat to the cultural identity and religious rights of Muslims, and people of Islamic faith have a constitutional right to Islamic shariah-based personal laws. A specific law, contentious between Hindu nationalists and their opponents in India, relates to the legal age of marriage for girls. Hindu nationalists seek that the legal age for marriage be eighteen that is universally applied to all girls regardless of their religion and that marriages be registered with local government to verify the age of marriage. Muslim clerics consider this proposal as unacceptable because under the shariah-derived personal law, a Muslim girl can be married at any age after she reaches puberty.\n\nHindu nationalism in India, states Katharine Adeney, is a controversial political subject, with no consensus about what it means or implies in terms of the form of government and religious rights of the minorities.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, there are over 1 billion Hindus worldwide (15% of world's population). Along with Christians (31.5%), Muslims (23.2%) and Buddhists (7.1%), Hindus are one of the four major religious groups of the world.\n\nMost Hindus are found in Asian countries. The countries with most Hindu residents and citizens include (in decreasing order) are India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, United States, Malaysia, United Kingdom, Myanmar, Canada, Mauritius, Guyana, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, Fiji, Suriname.\n\nThe fertility rate, that is children per woman, for Hindus is 2.4, which is less than the world average of 2.5. Pew Research projects that there will be 1.161 billion Hindus by 2020.\n\nIn more ancient times, Hindu kingdoms arose and spread the religion and traditions across Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Nepal, Burma, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines, and what is now central Vietnam.\n\nOver 3 million Hindus are found in Bali Indonesia, a culture whose origins trace back to ideas brought by Tamil Hindu traders to Indonesian islands in the 1st millennium CE. Their sacred texts are also the Vedas and the Upanishads. The Puranas and the Itihasa (mainly \"Ramayana\" and the \"Mahabharata\") are enduring traditions among Indonesian Hindus, expressed in community dances and shadow puppet (\"wayang\") performances. As in India, Indonesian Hindus recognises four paths of spirituality, calling it \"Catur Marga\". Similarly, like Hindus in India, Balinese Hindu believe that there are four proper goals of human life, calling it \"Catur Purusartha\" - dharma (pursuit of moral and ethical living), artha (pursuit of wealth and creative activity), kama (pursuit of joy and love) and moksha (pursuit of self-knowledge and liberation).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13861217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13861217", "title": "Immigration and crime", "text": "Immigration and crime\n\nImmigration and crime refers to perceived or actual relationships between crime and immigration. The academic literature provides mixed findings for the relationship between immigration and crime worldwide, but finds for the United States that immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or that it reduces the crime rate. A meta-analysis of 51 studies from 1994–2014 on the relationship between immigration and crime in different countries found that overall immigration reduces crime, but the relationship is very weak. The over-representation of immigrants in the criminal justice systems of several countries may be due to socioeconomic factors, imprisonment for migration offenses, and racial and ethnic discrimination by police and the judicial system. Research suggests that people tend to overestimate the relationship between immigration and criminality. The relationship between immigration and terrorism is understudied, but existing research suggests that the relationship is weak and that repression of the immigrants increases the terror risk.\n\nMuch of the empirical research on the causal relationship between immigration and crime has been limited due to weak instruments for determining causality. According to one economist writing in 2014, \"while there have been many papers that document various correlations between immigrants and crime for a range of countries and time periods, most do not seriously address the issue of causality.\" The problem with causality primarily revolves around the location of immigrants being endogenous, which means that immigrants tend to disproportionately locate in deprived areas where crime is higher (because they cannot afford to stay in more expensive areas) or because they tend to locate in areas where there is a large population of residents of the same ethnic background. A burgeoning literature relying on strong instruments provides mixed findings. As one economist describes the existing literature in 2014, \"most research for the US indicates that if any, this association is negative... while the results for Europe are mixed for property crime but no association is found for violent crime\". Another economist writing in 2014, describes how \"the evidence, based on empirical studies of many countries, indicates that there is no simple link between immigration and crime, but legalizing the status of immigrants has beneficial effects on crime rates.\" A 2009 review of the literature focusing on recent, high-quality studies from the United States found that immigration generally did not increase crime and often decreased it.\n\nThe relationship between crime and the legal status of immigrants remains understudied but studies on amnesty programs in the United States and Italy suggest that legal status can largely explain the differences in crime between legal and illegal immigrants, most likely because legal status leads to greater job market opportunities for the immigrants.\n\nExisting research suggests that labor market opportunities have a significant impact on immigrant crime rates. Young, male and poorly educated immigrants have the highest individual probabilities of imprisonment among immigrants. Research suggests that the allocation of immigrants to high crime neighborhoods increases individual immigrant crime propensity later in life, due to social interaction with criminals.\n\nSome factors may effect the reliability of data on suspect rates, crime rates, conviction rates and prison populations for drawing conclusions about immigrants’ overall involvement in criminal activity:\n\nThe relationship between immigration and terrorism remains understudied. A 2016 study finds that a higher level of migration is associated with a lower level of terrorism in the host country, but that migrants from terror-prone states do increase the risk of terrorism in the host country. The authors note though that \"only a minority of migrants from high-terrorism states can be associated with increases in terrorism, and not necessarily in a direct way.\" In 2018, Washington and Lee University law professor Nora V. Demleitner wrote that there is \"mixed evidence\" as to a relationship between immigration and terrorism. A paper by a group of German political scientists and economists, covering 1980–2010, found that there were more terrorist attacks in countries with a larger number of foreigners, but that, on average, the foreigners were not more likely to become terrorists than the natives. The study also found little evidence that terrorism is systematically imported from predominantly Muslim countries. The same study found that compared to the average “non-terror-rich” country, migrants from Algeria, Iran, India, Spain, and Turkey were all more likely to be involved in a terrorist attack, while migrants from Angola and Cambodia were less likely than the reference groups to commit terror.The study found that repression of the migrants increased the terror risk.\n\nAccording to Olivier Roy in 2017 analyzing the previous two decades of terrorism in France, the typical jihadist is a second-generation immigrant or convert who after a period of petty crime was radicalized in prison.\n\nGeorgetown University terrorism expert Daniel Byman argues that repression of minority groups, such as Muslims, makes it easier for terrorist organizations to recruit from those minority groups.. While French scholar Olivier Roy has argued that the burkini bans and secularist policies of France provoked religious violence in France, French scholar Gilles Kepel responded that Britain has no such policies and still suffered several jihadist attacks in 2017.\n\nA survey of existing research on immigration and crime in Japan found that \"prosecution and sentencing in Japan do seem to result in some disparities by nationality, but the available data are too limited to arrive at confident conclusions about their nature or magnitude\".\n\nAccording to a 1997 news report, a large portion of crimes by immigrants are by Chinese in Japan, and some highly publicized crimes by organized groups of Chinese (often with help of Japanese organized crime) have led to a negative public perception of immigrants.\n\nA 2017 study found that immigration to Malaysia decreases property crime rates and violent crime rates. In the case of property crime rates, this is in part because immigrants improve economic conditions for natives.\n\nA 2015 study found that the increase in immigration flows into western European countries that took place in the 2000s did \"not affect crime victimization, but it is associated with an increase in the fear of crime, the latter being consistently and positively correlated with the natives’ unfavourable attitude toward immigrants.\" In a survey of the existing economic literature on immigration and crime, one economist describes the existing literature in 2014 as showing that \"the results for Europe are mixed for property crime but no association is found for violent crime\".\n\nA report by Statistics Denmark released in December 2015 found that 83% of crimes are committed by individuals of Danish origin (88% of the total population), 3% by those of non-Danish Western descent and 14% by individuals of non-Western descent.\n\nMale Lebanese immigrants and their descendants, a big part of them being of Palestinian descent, have, at 257, the highest crime-index among the studied groups, which translates to crime rates 150% higher than the country's average. The index is standardized by both age and socioeconomic status. Men of Yugoslav origin and men originating in Turkey, Pakistan, Somalia and Morocco are associated with high crime-indexes, ranging between 187 and 205, which translate to crime rates about double the country's average. The lowest crime index is recorded among immigrants and descendants originating from the United States. Their crime-index, at 32, is far below the average for all men in Denmark. Among immigrants from China a very small crime-index is recorded as well, at 38.\n\nA 2014 study of the random dispersal of refugee immigrants over the period 1986–1998, and focusing on the immigrant children who underwent this random assignment before the age of 15, suggests that exposure to neighbourhood crime increases individual crime propensity. The share of convicted criminals living in the assignment neighborhood at assignment affects later crime convictions of males, but not of females, who were assigned to these neighborhoods as children. The authors \"find that a one standard deviation increase in the share of youth criminals living in the assignment neighborhood, and who committed a crime in the assignment year, increases the probability of a conviction for male assignees by between 5 percent and 9 percent later in life (when they are between 15 and 21 years old).\"\n\nOne study of Denmark found that providing immigrants with voting rights reduced their crime rate.\n\nAt 4%, male migrants aged 15–64 with non-Western backgrounds had twice the conviction rate against the Danish Penal Code in 2018, compared to 2% for Danish men. In a given year, about 13% of all male descendants of non-Western migrants aged 17–24 are convicted against the penal code.\n\nA 2015 study found that immigrant youth had higher incidence rates in 14 out of 17 delinquent acts. The gap is small for thefts and vandalism, and no significant differences for shoplifting, bullying and use of intoxicants. According to the authors, \"weak parental social control and risk routines, such as staying out late, appear to partly explain the immigrant youths’ higher delinquency\", and \"the relevance of socioeconomic factors was modest\".\n\nAccording to the American Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Estonians and Romanians were the two largest group of foreigners in Finnish prisons.\n\nAccording to 2014 official statistics, 24% of rapes are estimated to have been committed by individuals with foreign surnames in Finland. For some context, foreign-language speakers and the foreign-born comprised roughly 6% of the Finnish population in 2014, meaning that the percentage of individuals with foreign surnames in Finland is at very least 6%. There are great differences in representation between nationalities of rapists: while in 1998 there were no rapists hailing from Vietnam or China, there were many from other countries; 10 times more \"foreign-looking\" men were accused of rape than the overall percentage of foreigners in Finland.\n\nIn 2016, in a report authored by the Police school and the Immigration Service (Migri), 131 Finnish citizens were subjected to sexual assault by asylum migrants of which 8 out of 10 were committed against Finnish women. Almost half the sexual assaults against women the victim was under 18. Iraqis made up 2/3 of the suspects and all the suspects originated in Iraq, Afghanistan, Morocco, Iran, Bangladesh, Somalia or Syria. The investigation also analysed the number of suspects with respect to background, it was found that every fifth Algerian asylum seeker had been suspected of a crime, 15% of Belorussinans, 13% of the Moroccans and less than 10% for other nationalities.\n\nA 2009 study found \"that the share of immigrants in the population has no significant impact on crime rates once immigrants’ economic circumstances are controlled for, while finding that unemployed immigrants tend to commit more crimes than unemployed non-immigrants.\"\n\nA study by sociologist , director of studies at the EHESS, found that \"Muslims, mostly from North African origin, are becoming the most numerous group in [French prisons].\" His work has been criticized for taking into account only 160 prisoners in 4 prisons, all close to northern Paris where most immigrants live.\n\nIn 2018, the \"Wall Street Journal\" analysed German crime statistics for crime suspects and found that the foreigners, overall 12.8% of the population, make up a disproportionate share of crime suspects (34.7%), see horizontal bar chart.\n\nIn 2017, as in previous years German citizens constituted the largest group of suspects in organised crime trials. The fraction of non-German citizen suspects increased from 67.5% to 70.7% while the fraction of German citizens decreased correspondingly. For the German citizens, 14.9% had a different citizenship at birth.\n\nPublished in 2017, the first comprehensive study of the social effects of the one million refugees going to Germany found that it caused \"very small increases in crime in particular with respect to drug offenses and fare-dodging.\" A January 2018 Zurich University of Applied Sciences study commissioned by the German government attributed over 90% of a 10% overall rise in violent crime from to 2015 to 2016 in Lower Saxony could to refugees. The study's authors noted that there were great differences between different refugee groups. Refugees from North African countries Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco constituted 0.9% of refugees but represented 17.1% of violent crime refugee suspects and 31% of robbery refugee suspects. The latter corresponds to a 35-fold over-representation. Refugees from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq represented 54.7% of the total, but represented 16% of refugee robbery suspects and 34.9% violent crime suspects and were thus underrepresented.\n\nA report released by the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation in November 2015 found that over the period January–September 2015, the crime rate of refugees was the same as that of native Germans. According to Deutsche Welle, the report \"concluded that the majority of crimes committed by refugees (67 percent) consisted of theft, robbery and fraud. Sex crimes made for less than 1 percent of all crimes committed by refugees, while homicide registered the smallest fraction at 0.1 percent.\" According to the conservative newspaper Die Welt's description of the report, the most common crime committed by refugees was not paying fares on public transportation. According to Deutsche Welle's reporting in February 2016 of a report by the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation, the number of crimes committed by refugees did not rise in proportion to the number of refugees between 2014–2015. According to Deutsche Welle, \"between 2014 and 2015, the number of crimes committed by refugees increased by 79 percent. Over the same period the number of refugees in Germany increased by 440 percent.\"\n\nThe U.S. fact-checker Politifact noted that Germany's crime data suggests that the crime rate of the average refugee is lower than that of the average German. In April 2017, the crime figures released for 2016 showed that the number of suspected crimes by refugees, asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants increased by 50 percent. The figures showed that most of the suspected crimes were by repeat offenders, and that 1 percent of migrants accounted for 40 percent of total migrant crimes. From 2016 to 2017, the number of crimes committed by foreigners in Germany decreased by 23%.\n\nA 2017 study in the \"European Economic Review\" found that the German government's policy of immigration of more than 3 million people of German descent to Germany after the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a significant increase in crime. The effects were strongest in regions with high unemployment, high preexisting crime levels or large shares of foreigners.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study in the \"European Journal of Criminology\", the crime rate was higher among immigrant youths than native youths during the 1990s and 2000s but most of the difference could be explained by socioeconomic factors. The different crime rates narrowed in the last ten years; the study speculates that \"a new citizenship law finally granting German-born descendants of guest workers German citizenship, as well as increased integration efforts (particularly in schools) and a stronger disapproval of violence\" may have contributed to this narrowing.\n\nDW reported in 2006 that in Berlin, young male immigrants are three times more likely to commit violent crimes than their German peers. Hans-Jörg Albrecht, director of the Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal law in Freiburg, stated that the \"one over-riding factor in youth crime [was] peer group pressure.\" Whereas the Gastarbeiter in the 50s and 60s did not have an elevated crime rate, second- and third-generation of immigrants had significantly higher crime rates.\n\nIllegal immigration to Greece has increased rapidly over the past several years. Tough immigration policies in Spain and Italy and agreements with their neighboring African countries to combat illegal immigration have changed the direction of African immigration flows toward Greece. At the same time, flows from Asia and the Middle East—mainly Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Bangladesh—to Greece appear to have increased as well. By 2012 it was estimated that more than 1 million illegal immigrants entered Greece. The evidence now indicates that nearly all illegal immigration to the European Union flows through the country's porous borders. In 2010, 90 percent of all apprehensions for unauthorized entry into the European Union took place in Greece, compared to 75 percent in 2009 and 50 percent in 2008.\n\nIn 2010, 132,524 persons were arrested for \"illegal entry or stay\" in Greece, a sharp increase from 95,239 in 2006. Nearly half of those arrested (52,469) were immediately deported, the majority of them being Albanians. Official statistics show that immigrants are responsible for about half of the criminal activity in Greece.\n\nForeigners are under-represented in the Irish prison population, according to 2010 figures.\n\nA study of immigration to Italy during the period 1990–2003 found that \"immigration increases only the incidence of robberies, while leaving unaffected all other types of crime. Since robberies represent a very minor fraction of all criminal offenses, the effect on the overall crime rate is not significantly different from zero.\" Over the period 2007-2016, the crime rate among foreigners decreased by around 65%.\n\nA study of Italy before and after the January 2007 European Union enlargement found that giving legal status to the previously illegal immigrants from the new EU members states led to a \"50 percent reduction in recidivism\". The authors find that \"legal status... explains one-half to two-thirds of the observed differences in crime rates between legal and illegal immigrants\". A study on the 2007 so-called \"click day\" amnesty for undocumented immigrants in Italy found that the amnesty reduced the immigrant crime rate. The authors estimate \"that a ten percent increase in the share of immigrants legalized in one region would imply a 0.3 percent reduction in immigrants’ criminal charges in the following year in that same region\". Research shows that stricter enforcement of migration policy leads to a reduction in the crime rate of undocumented migrants.\n\nAccording to the latest report by Idos/Unar, immigrants made up 32,6% of prison population in 2015 (four percentage points less than five years before), immigrants making up 8,2% of population in 2015. Prison population data may not give a reliable picture of immigrants' involvement in criminal activity due to different bail and sentencing decisions for foreigners. Foreigners are, for instance, far more overrepresented in the prison population than their share of convictions relative to the native population. According to a 2013 study, the majority of foreign prisoners are held in connection with a drug offence. One out of every nine offences ascribed to foreign prisoners concerns violation of ‘laws governing foreigners’. The 2013 study cites literature that points to discriminatory practices against foreigners by Italian law enforcement, judiciary and penal system.\n\nAccording to a 2013 report, \"undocumented immigrants are responsible for the vast majority of crimes committed in Italy by immigrants... the share of undocumented immigrants varies between 60 and 70 percent for violent crimes, and it increases to 70–85 for property crime. In 2009, the highest shares are in burglary (85), car theft (78), theft (76), robbery (75), assaulting public officer / resisting arrest (75), handling stolen goods (73).\"\n\nThe 2013 report notes that \"immigrants accounted for almost 23 percent of the criminal charges although they represented only 6‐7 percent of the resident population\" in 2010.\n\nAccording to 2007 data, the crime rate of legal immigrants was 1.2–1.4% whereas the crime rate was 0.8% for native Italians. The overrepresentation is partly due to the large number of young legal immigrants, the crime rate is 1.9% for legal immigrants aged 18–44 whereas it is 1.5% for their Italian peers; 0.4% for legal immigrants aged 45–64 years whereas it is 0.7% for their Italian peers; and for those over 65 years old, the crime rates is the same among natives and foreigners. 16.9% of crimes committed by legal immigrants aged 18–44 are linked to violations of immigration laws. By excluding those crimes, the crime rate of legal immigrants aged 18–44 is largely the same as that of same aged Italians.\n\nNon-native Dutch youths, especially young Antillean and Surinamese Rotterdammers, commit more crimes than the average. More than half of Moroccan-Dutch male youths aged 18 to 24 years in Rotterdam have ever been investigated by the police, as compared to close to a quarter of native male youths. Eighteen percent of foreign-born young people aged from 18 to 24 have been investigated for crimes.\n\nAccording to a 2009 report commissioned by Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin, 63% of the 447 teenagers convicted of serious crime are children of parents born outside the Netherlands. All these cases concern crime for which the maximum jail sentence is longer than eight years, such as robbery with violence, extortion, arson, public acts of violence, sexual assault, manslaughter and murder. The ethnic composition of the perpetrators was: native Dutch – 37%; Moroccans – 14%; Unknown origin – 14%; \"other non-Westerners\" – 9%; Turkish – 8%; Surinamese – 7%; Antillean – 7%; and \"other Westerners\" – 4%. In the majority of cases, the judges did not consider the serious offences to be grave enough to necessitate an unconditional jail sentence.\n\nAnalysis of police data for 2002 by ethnicity showed that 37.5 percent of all crime suspects living in the Netherlands were of foreign origin (including those of the second generation), almost twice as high as the share of immigrants in the Dutch population. The highest rates per capita were found among first and second generation male migrants of a non‐Western background. Of native male youths between the ages of 18 and 24, in 2002 2.2% were arrested, of all immigrant males of the same age 4.4%, of second generation non-Western males 6.4%. The crime rates for so‐called ‘Western migrants’ were very close to those of the native Dutch. In all groups, the rates for women were considerably lower than for men, lower than one percent, with the highest found among second generation non‐western migrants, 0.9% (Blom et al. 2005: 31).\n\nFor Moroccan immigrants, whether they originate from the underdeveloped parts of Morocco has a modest impact on their crime rate. One study finds that \"crime rates in the Netherlands are higher among Moroccans who come from the countryside and the Rif, or whose parents do, than among those who come from the urban provinces in Morocco and from outside the Rif, or whose parents do.\" In 2015, individuals with a Moroccan background were, not taking their age into account, almost six times as likely to be suspected for a crime compared to the native Dutch. Of the first generation 2.52% was suspected of a crime, of the second generation 7.36%, of males 7.78% and women 1.34%.\n\nUsing 2015 data, Statistics Netherlands concluded that non-Western male immigrant youths had been relatively often suspected of a crime: 5.42% in the group aged between 18 and 24, compared with 1.92% for native Dutch of the same age. For both male and female non-Western immigrants of all ages combined the numbers were 2.4% for the first generation and 4.54% for the second. The absolute crime rate had dropped by almost a half since the early twenty-first century, for both native Dutch and non-western immigrants. In 2017, a study concluded that asylum seekers in the Netherlands were less criminal than native Dutch with the same combination of age, gender and socio-economic position.\n\nA 2011 report by Statistics Norway found that immigrants are over-represented in crime statistics but that there is substantial variation by country of origin. The report furthermore found that \"the overrepresentation is substantially reduced when adjusting for population structure—for some groups as much as 45 per cent, but there are also some groups where the over-representation still is large.\" According to the report, the data for 2009 shows that first-generation immigrants from Africa were three times more likely than ethnic Norwegians (or rather individuals who are neither first- nor second-generation immigrants) to be convicted of a felony while Somali immigrants in particular being 4.4 times more likely to be convicted of a felony than an ethnic Norwegian was. Similarly, Iraqis and Pakistanis were found to have rates of conviction for felonies greater than ethnic Norwegians by a factor of 3 and 2.6 respectively. Another finding was that second-generation African and Asian immigrants had a higher rate of convictions for felonies than first-generation immigrants. While first-generation African immigrants had conviction rates for felonies of 16.7 per 1,000 individuals over the age of 15, for second-generation immigrants the rate was 28 per 1,000—an increase of over 60%. And for Asian immigrants an increase from 9.3 per 1,000 to 17.1 per 1,000 was observed. In 2010 13% of sexual crimes charges were filed against first generation immigrants who make up 7.8% of the population—a rate of over-representation of 1.7.\n\nIn 2010, a spokesperson for the Oslo Police Department stated that every case of assault rapes in Oslo in the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 was committed by a non-Western immigrant. When only perpetrators in the solved cases were counted, it was found that four of the victims in the 16 unsolved cases described the perpetrator as being of White (not necessarily Norwegian) ethnicity.\n\nA 2011 report by the Oslo Police District shows that of the 131 individuals charged with the 152 rapes in which the perpetrator could be identified, 45.8% were of African, Middle Eastern or Asian origin while 54.2% were of Norwegian, other European or American origin. In the cases of \"assault rape\", i.e. rape aggravated by physical violence, a category that included 6 of the 152 cases and 5 of the 131 identified individuals, the 5 identified individuals were of African, Middle Eastern or Asian origin. In the cases of assault rape where the individual responsible was not identified and the police relied on the description provided by the victim, 8 of the perpetrators were of African/dark-skinned appearance, 4 were Western/light/Nordic and 4 had an Asian appearance.\n\nIn 2018, an investigation into court cases involving domestic violence against children showed that 47% of the cases involved parents who were both born abroad. According to a researcher at Norwegian Police University College the over-representation was due to cultural (honor culture) and legal differences in Norway and foreign countries.\n\nA 2008 study finds that the rates of crimes committed by immigrants are substantially higher than nationals. The study finds that \"the arrival of immigrants has resulted in a lack of progress in the reduction of offences against property and in a minor increase in the number of offences against Collective Security (i.e. drugs and trafficking). In the case of nationals, their contribution to the increase in the crime rate is primarily concentrated in offences against persons.\" By controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors, the gap between immigrants and natives is reduced but not fully. The authors also find \"that a higher proportions of American, non-UE European, and African immigrants tend to widen the crime differential, the effect being larger for the latter ones\". The same paper provides supports for the notion that labour market conditions impact the relationship between crime and immigration. Cultural differences were also statistically detected. This study has been criticized for not using strong instruments for identifying causality: the \"instruments (lagged values of the covariates and measures of the service share of GDP in a province) are not convincing in dealing with the endogeneity of migrant location choice.\"\n\nSpanish National Statistics Institute (INE) published a study that analyzes records in the Register of Convicted in 2008. The data show that immigrants are overrepresented in the crime statistics: 70% of all crimes were committed by Spaniards and 30% by foreigners. Foreigners make up 15% of the population.\n\nIn Switzerland, 69.7% of the prison population did not have Swiss citizenship, compared to 22.1% of total resident population (as of 2008).\nThe figure of arrests by residence status is not usually made public. In 1997, when there were for the first time more foreigners than Swiss among the convicts under criminal law (out of a fraction of 20.6% of the total population at the time), a special report was compiled by the Federal Department of Justice and Police (published in 2001) which for the year 1998 found an arrest rate per 1000 adult population of 2.3 for Swiss citizens, 4.2 for legally resident aliens and 32 for asylum seekers. 21% of arrests made concerned individuals with no residence status, who were thus either \"sans papiers\" or \"crime tourists\" without any permanent residence in Switzerland.\n\nA 2016 study found that asylum seekers exposed to conflict during childhood were far more prone to violent crimes than co-national asylum seekers who were not exposed to conflict. The conflict exposed cohorts have a higher propensity to target victims from their own nationality. Offering labor market access to the asylum seekers eliminates the entire effect of conflict exposure on crime propensity.\n\nIn 2010, a statistic was published which listed delinquency by nationality (based on 2009 data).\nTo avoid distortions due to demographic structure, only the male population aged between 18 and 34 was considered for each group. From the study, it became clear that crime rate is highly correlated on the country of origin of the various migrant groups.\nThus, immigrants from Germany, France and Austria had a significantly lower crime rate than Swiss citizens (60% to 80%), while immigrants from Angola, Nigeria and Algeria had a crime rate of above 600% of that of Swiss population.\nIn between these extremes were immigrants from Former Yugoslavia, with crime rates of between 210% and 300% of the Swiss value.\n\nThose with immigrant background are over-represented in Swedish crime statistics, but research shows that socioeconomic factors, such as unemployment, poverty, exclusion language, and other skills explain most of difference in crime rates between immigrants and natives.\n\nCrime and immigration is one of the major themes of the 2018 Swedish general election.\n\nIn 2018, Swedish Television investigative journalism show Uppdrag Granskning analysed the total of 843 district court cases from the five preceding years and found that 58% of all convicted of rape had a foreign background and 40% were born in the Middle East and Africa, with young men from Afghanistan numbering 45 stood out as being the most next most common country of birth after Sweden. When only analysing rape assault (Swedish: \"överfallsvåldtäkt\") cases, that is cases where perpetrator and victim were not previously acquainted, 97 out of 129 were born outside Europe.\n\nViral falsehoods have circulated in recent years that tie immigrants and refugees to an alleged surge of crime in Sweden. According to Jerzy Sarnecki, a criminologist at Stockholm University, \"What we’re hearing is a very, very extreme exaggeration based on a few isolated events, and the claim that it’s related to immigration is more or less not true at all.\" According to Klara Selin, a sociologist at the National Council for Crime Prevention, the major reasons why Sweden has a higher rate of rape than other countries is due to the way in which Sweden documents rape (\"if a woman reports being raped multiple times by her husband that’s recorded as multiple rapes, for instance, not just one report\") and a culture where women are encouraged to report rapes. Stina Holmberg at the National Council for Crime Prevention, noted that \"there is no basis for drawing the conclusion that crime rates are soaring in Sweden and that that is related to immigration\".\n\nIn February 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that crime was surging in Sweden due to immigration. According to FactCheck.Org, Trump's claim was an exaggeration and noted that \"experts said there is no evidence of a major crime wave.\" According to official statistics, the reported crime rate in Sweden has risen since 2005 whereas annual government surveys show that the number of Swedes experiencing crime remain steady since 2005, even as Sweden has taken in hundreds of thousands of immigrants and refugees over the same period. Jerzy Sarnecki, a criminologist at the University of Stockholm, said foreign-born residents are twice as likely to be registered for a crime as native Swedes but that other factors beyond place of birth are at play, such as education level and poverty, and that similar trends occur in European countries that have not taken in a lot of immigrants in recent years.\n\nAccording to data gathered by Swedish police from October 2015 to January 2016, 5,000 police calls out of 537,466 involved asylum seekers and refugees. According to Felipe Estrada, professor of criminology at Stockholm University, this shows how the media gives disproportionate attention to and exaggerates the alleged criminal involvement of asylum seekers and refugees. Henrik Selin, head of the Department for Intercultural Dialogue at the Swedish Institute, noted that allegations of a surge in immigrant crime after the intake of more than 160,000 immigrants in 2015 have been “highly exaggerated... there is nothing to support the claim that the crime rate took off after the 160,000 came in 2015.” While it’s true that immigrants have been over-represented among those committing crimes—particularly in some suburban communities heavily populated by immigrants, he said—the issue of crime and immigration is complex. Speaking in February 2017, Manne Gerell, a doctoral student in criminology at Malmo University, noted that while immigrants where disproportionately represented among crime suspects, many of the victims of immigrant crimes were other immigrants.\n\nA Swedish Police report from May 2016 found that there have been 123 incidents of sexual molestation in the country's public baths and pools in 2015 (112 of them were directed against girls). In 55% of cases, the perpetrator could be reasonably identified. From these identified perpetrators, 80% were of foreign origin. The same report found 319 cases of sexual assault on public streets and parks in 2015. In these cases, only 17 suspected perpetrators have been identified, 4 of them Swedish nationals with the remainder being of foreign origin. Another 17 were arrested, but not identified.\n\nIn March 2018, newspaper Expressen investigated gang rape court cases from the two preceding years and found that there were 43 men having been convicted. Their average age was 21 and 13 were under the age of 18 when the crime was committed. Of the convicted, 40 out of the 43 were either immigrants (born abroad) or born in Sweden to immigrant parents. Another investigation by newspaper Aftonbladet found that of 112 men and boys convicted for gang rape since July 2012, 82 were born outside Europe. The median age of the victims was 15, while 7 out of 10 perpetrators were between 15 to 20. According to professor Christian Diesen, a foreigner may have a lower threshold to commit sexual assault due to having grown up in a misogynist culture where all women outside the home are interpreted as available. Also professor Henrik Tham stated that there was a clear over-representatation of foreigners and cultural differences, while also adding that few cultures allow such behaviour. Professor Jerzy Sarnecki instead emphasized socioeconomic factors and that police may be more diligient in investigating crimes by foreigners.\n\nA 2014 survey of several studies found that people with foreign background are, on average, two times more likely to commit crimes than those born in Sweden. This figure has remained stable since the 1970s, despite the changes in numbers of immigrants and their country of origin. Some studies reporting a link on immigration and crime have been criticized for not taking into account the population's age, employment and education level, all of which affect level of crime. In general, research that takes these factors into account does not support the idea that there is a link between immigration and crime.\n\nA 2005 study by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention found that people of foreign background were 2.5 times more likely to be suspected of crimes than people with a Swedish background, including immigrants being four times more likely to be suspected of for lethal violence and robbery, five times more likely to be investigated for sex crimes, and three times more likely to be investigated for violent assault. The report was based on statistics for those \"suspected\" of offences. The Council for Crime Prevention said that there was \"little difference\" in the statistics for those suspected of crimes and those actually convicted. A 2006 government report suggests that immigrants face discrimination by law enforcement, which could lead to meaningful differences between those suspected of crimes and those actually convicted. A 2008 report by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention finds evidence of discrimination towards individuals of foreign descent in the Swedish judicial system. The 2005 report finds that immigrants who entered Sweden during early childhood have lower crime rates than other immigrants. By taking account of socioeconomic factors (gender, age, education and income), the crime rate gap between immigrants and natives decreases.\n\nA 2013 study done by Stockholm University showed that the 2005 study's difference was due to the socioeconomic differences (e.g. family income, growing up in a poor neighborhood) between people born in Sweden and those born abroad. The authors furthermore found \"that culture is unlikely to be a strong cause of crime among immigrants\".\n\nA study published in 1997 attempted to explain the higher than average crime rates among immigrants to Sweden. It found that between 20 and 25 percent of asylum seekers to Sweden had experienced physical torture, and many suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Other refugees had witnessed a close relative being killed.\n\nThe 2005 study reported that persons from North Africa and Western Asia were over-represented in crime statistics, whereas a 1997 paper additionally found immigrants from Finland, South America, Arab world and Eastern Europe to be over-represented in crime statistics. Studies have found that native-born Swedes with high levels of unemployment are also over-represented in crime statistics.\n\nA 1996 report by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention determined that between 1985 and 1989 individuals born in Iraq, North Africa (Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia), Africa (excluding Uganda and the North African countries), other Middle East (Jordan, Palestine, Syria), Iran and Eastern Europe (Romania, Bulgaria) were convicted of rape at rates 20, 23, 17, 9, 10 and 18 greater than individuals born in Sweden respectively. Both the 1996 and 2005 reports have been criticized for using insufficient controls for socioeconomic factors.\n\nA 2013 study found that both first- and second-generation immigrants have a higher rate of suspected offenses than indigenous Swedes. While first-generation immigrants have the highest offender rate, the offenders have the lowest average number of offenses, which indicates that there is a high rate of low-rate offending (many suspected offenders with only one single registered offense). The rate of chronic offending (offenders suspected of several offenses) is higher among indigenous Swedes than first-generation immigrants. Second-generation immigrants have higher rates of chronic offending than first-generation immigrants but lower total offender rates.\n\nHistorically, Irish immigrants to the United Kingdom in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were considered over-represented amongst those appearing in court. Research suggests that policing strategy may have put immigrants at a disadvantage by targeting only the most public forms of crime, while locals were more likely able to engage in the types of crimes that could be conducted behind locked doors. An analysis of historical courtroom records suggests that despite higher rates of arrest, immigrants were not systematically disadvantaged by the British court system in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\nOn 30 June 2013 there were 10,786 prisoners from 160 different countries in the jails of England and Wales. Poland, Jamaica and the Irish Republic formed the highest percentage of foreign nationals in UK prisons. In total, foreigners represented 13% of the prison population, whereas foreign nationals are 13% of the total population in England and Wales. During the 2000s, there was a 111% increase of foreign nationals in UK prisons. According to one study, \"there is little evidence to support the theory that the foreign national prison population continues to grow because foreign nationals are more likely to commit crime than are British citizens or more likely to commit crime of a serious nature\". The increase may partly be due to the disproportionate number of convicted for drug offences; crimes associated with illegal immigration (fraud and forgery of government documents, and immigration offenses); ineffective deportation provisions; and a lack of viable options to custody (which affects bail and sentencing decision making).\n\nResearch has found no evidence of an average causal impact of immigration on crime. One study based on evidence from England and Wales in the 2000s found no evidence of an average causal impact of immigration on crime in England and Wales. No causal impact and no immigrant differences in the likelihood of being arrested were found for London, which saw large immigration changes. A study of two large waves of immigration to the UK (the late 1990s/early 2000s asylum seekers and the post-2004 inflow from EU accession countries) found that the \"first wave led to a modest but significant rise in property crime, while the second wave had a small negative impact. There was no effect on violent crime; arrest rates were not different, and changes in crime cannot be ascribed to crimes against immigrants. The findings are consistent with the notion that differences in labor market opportunities of different migrant groups shape their potential impact on crime.\" A 2013 study found \"that crime is significantly lower in those neighborhoods with sizeable immigrant population shares\" and that \"the crime reducing effect is substantially enhanced if the enclave is composed of immigrants from the same ethnic background.\" A 2014 study of property crimes based on the Crime and Justice Survey (CJS) of 2003, (a national representative survey where respondents in England and Wales were asked questions regarding their criminal activities), after taking into account the under-reporting of crimes, even found that \"immigrants who are located in London and black immigrants are significantly less criminally active than their native counterparts\". Another 2014 study found that \"areas that have witnessed the greatest percentage of recent immigrants arriving since 2004 have not witnessed higher levels of robbery, violence, or sex offending\" but have \"experienced higher levels of drug offenses.\"\n\nIt was reported in 2007 that more than one-fifth of solved crimes in London was committed by immigrants. Around a third of all solved, reported sex offences and a half of all solved, reported frauds in the capital were carried out by non-British citizens. A 2008 study found that the crime rate of Eastern European immigrants was the same as that of the indigenous population.\n\nA 2014 study found that immigration reduced the crime rate in Canada: \"new immigrants do not have a significant impact on property crime rates, but as they stay longer, more established immigrants actually decrease property crime rates significantly.\"\n\nThere is no empirical evidence that either legal or illegal immigration increases crime rate in the United States. Most studies in the U.S. have found lower crime rates among immigrants than among non-immigrants, and that higher concentrations of immigrants are associated with lower crime rates. These findings contradict popular perceptions that immigration increases crime. Some research even suggests that increases in immigration may partly explain the reduction in the U.S. crime rate. A 2017 study suggests that immigration did not play a significant part in lowering the crime rate. A 2005 study showed that immigration to large U.S. metropolitan areas does not increase, and in some cases decreases, crime rates there. A 2009 study found that recent immigration was not associated with homicide in Austin, Texas. The low crime rates of immigrants to the United States despite having lower levels of education, lower levels of income and residing in urban areas (factors that should lead to higher crime rates) may be due to lower rates of antisocial behavior among immigrants. A 2015 study found that Mexican immigration to the United States was associated with an increase in aggravated assaults and a decrease in property crimes. A 2016 study finds no link between immigrant populations and violent crime, although there is a small but significant association between undocumented immigrants and drug-related crime.\n\nA 2018 study found that undocumented immigration to the United States did not increase violent crime. A 2017 study found that \"Increased undocumented immigration was significantly associated with reductions in drug arrests, drug overdose deaths, and DUI arrests, net of other factors.\" Research finds that Secure Communities, an immigration enforcement program which led to a quarter of a million of detentions (when the study was published; November 2014), had no observable impact on the crime rate. A 2015 study found that the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which legalized almost 3 million immigrants, led to \"decreases in crime of 3–5 percent, primarily due to decline in property crimes, equivalent to 120,000–180,000 fewer violent and property crimes committed each year due to legalization\". According to two studies, sanctuary cities—which adopt policies designed to not prosecute people solely for being an illegal alien—have no statistically meaningful effect on crime. A 2018 study in the \"American Economic Journal: Economic Policy\" found that by restricting the employment opportunities for unauthorized immigrants, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) likely caused an increase in crime.\n\nA 2018 paper found no statistically significant evidence that refugees to the United States have an impact on crime rates.\n\nOne of the first political analyses in the U.S. of the relationship between immigration and crime was performed in the beginning of the 20th century by the Dillingham Commission, which found a relationship especially for immigrants from non-Northern European countries, resulting in the sweeping 1920s immigration reduction acts, including the Emergency Quota Act of 1921, which favored immigration from northern and western Europe. Recent research is skeptical of the conclusion drawn by the Dillingham Commission. One study finds that \"major government commissions on immigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that suffered from aggregation bias and the absence of accurate population data, which led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the immigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we find that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite similar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the commitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born. By 1930, immigrants were less likely than natives to be committed to prisons at all ages 20 and older, but this advantage disappears when one looks at commitments for violent offenses.\"\n\nFor the early twentieth century, one study found that immigrants had \"quite similar\" imprisonment rates for major crimes as natives in 1904 but lower for major crimes (except violent offenses; the rate was similar) in 1930. Contemporary commissions used dubious data and interpreted it in questionable ways. A study by Harvard economist Nathan Nunn, Yale economist Nancy Qian and LSE economist Sandra Sequeira found that the Age of Mass Migration (1850–1920) had no long-run effects on crime rates in the United States.\n\nAccording to a review by the \"Washington Post\" fact-checker of the available research and evidence, there is nothing to support President Trump's claim that \"the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.\" The fact-checker noted that the Government Accountability Office had found that \"of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since Sept. 12, 2001, 73 percent (62) were committed by far-right-wing violent extremist groups, and 27 percent (23) by radical Islamist violent extremists\". A bulletin by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security also warned in May 2017 \"that white supremacist groups were “responsible for a lion’s share of violent attacks among domestic extremist groups\". According to a report by the New America foundation, of the individuals credibly involved in radical Islamist-inspired activity in the United States since 9/11, the large majority were US-born citizens, not immigrants.\n\nA 2018 paper found no statistically significant evidence that refugee settlements in the United States are linked to terrorism events.\n\nForeigners are under-represented in the Australian prison population, according to 2010 figures. A 1987 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology noted that studies had consistently found that migrant populations in Australia had lower crime rates than the Australian-born population.\n\nThe alleged link between immigration and criminality has been a longstanding meme in Australian history with many of the original immigrants being convicts. During the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of emigrants to the country arrived from Italy and Greece, and were shortly afterwards associated with local crime. This culminated in the \"Greek conspiracy case\" of the 1970s, when Greek physicians were accused of defrauding the Medibank system. The police were later found to have conducted investigations improperly, and the doctors were eventually cleared of all charges. After the demise of the White Australia policy restricting non-European immigration, the first large settler communities from Asia emerged. This development was accompanied by a moral panic regarding a potential spike in criminal activity by the Triads and similar organizations. In 1978, the erstwhile weekly \"The National Times\" also reported on involvement in the local drug trade by Calabrian Italian, Turkish, Lebanese and Chinese dealers.\n\nDiscourse surrounding immigrant crime reached a head in the late 1990s. The fatal stabbing of a Korean teenager in Punchbowl in October 1998 followed by a drive-by shooting of the Lakemba police station prompted then New South Wales Premier Bob Carr and NSW Police Commissioner Peter Ryan to blame the incidents on Lebanese gangs. Spurred on by the War on Terror, immigrant identities became increasingly criminalized in the popular Sydney media. By the mid-2000s and the outbreak of the Cronulla riots, sensationalist broadcast and tabloid media representations had reinforced existing stereotypes of immigrant communities as criminal entities and ethnic enclaves as violent and dangerous areas.\n\nThe only reliable statistics on immigrant crime in Australia are based on imprisonment rates by place of birth. As of 1999, this data indicated that immigrants from Vietnam (2.7 per 1,000 of population), Lebanon (1.6) and New Zealand (1.6) were over-represented within the national criminal justice system. Compared to the Australian-born (1), immigrants from Italy (0.6), the United Kingdom (0.6), Ireland (0.6) and Greece (0.5) were under-represented.\n\nVictoria Police said in 2012 that Sudanese and Somali immigrants were around five times more likely to commit crimes than other state residents. The rate of offending in the Sudanese community was 7109.1 per 100,000 individuals, whereas it was 6141.8 per 100,000 for Somalis, and 1301.0 per 100,000 for the wider Victoria community. Robbery and assault said to have been the most common types of crime committed by the Sudanese and Somali residents, with assault purported to represent 29.5% and 24.3% of all offences, respectively. The overall proportion of crime in the state said to have been committed by members of the Sudanese community was 0.92 percent, while it was 0.35 percent for Somali residents. People born in Sudan and Somalia are around 0.1 and 0.05 per cent, respectively, of Victoria's population. Journalist Dan Oakes, writing in \"The Age\", noted that individuals arrested and charged might have been falsely claiming to belong to each community. In 2015, Sudanese-born youths were \"vastly over-represented\" in Victoria Police LEAP data, responsible for 7.44 per cent of alleged home invasions, 5.65 per cent of car thefts and 13.9 per cent of aggravated robberies. A similar overrepresentation occurs in Kenyan-born youths. In January 2018, Acting Chief Commissioner Shane Patton that there was an \"issue with overrepresentation by African youth in serious and violent offending as well as public disorder issues\".\n\nIn the late 2000s, following a series of arrests in Melbourne on terrorism-related charges, Australian security officials expressed concerns of possible attacks by Al-Qaeda-affiliated extremists from North Africa.\n\nIn 2010, six applicants brought charges of impropriety against several members of the Victorian Police, the Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, and the State of Victoria in the Melbourne areas of Flemington and Kensington. The ensuing \"Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis\" case alleged various forms of mistreatment by the public officials in violation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. In March 2012, an order of discovery was made, whereby established statistician Ian Gordon of the University of Melbourne independently analysed Victorian Police LEAP data from Flemington and North Melbourne (2005–2008). The report concluded that residents from Africa were two and a half times more likely to be subjected to an arbitrary \"stop and search\" than their representation in the population. Although the justification provided for such disproportionate policing measures was over-representation in local crime statistics, the study found that the same police LEAP data in reality showed that male immigrants from Africa on average committed substantially less crime than male immigrants from other backgrounds. Despite this, the latter alleged male offenders were observed to be 8.5 times more likely not to be the subject of a police \"field contact\". The case was eventually settled on 18 February 2013, with a landmark agreement that the Victoria Police would publicly review its \"field contact\" and training processes. The inquiry is expected to help police identify areas where discrimination in the criminal justice system has the potential to or does occur; implement institutional reforms as pre-emptive measures in terms of training, policy and practice; predicate changes on international law enforcement best practices; ammeliorate the local police's interactions with new immigrants and ethnic minorities, as well as with the Aboriginal community; and serve as a benchmark for proper conduct vis-a-vis other police departments throughout the country.\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics regularly publishes characteristics of those incarcerated including country of birth. The 2014 figures show that in general native-born Australians, New Zealanders, Vietnamese, Lebanese, Sudanese, Iraqi and people from Fiji are responsible for higher share of crime than their share in the population (overrepresented), while people from the UK, the Chinese and people from Philippines are responsible for a lower share (underrepresented).\n\nForeigners are under-represented in the New Zealand prison population, according to 2010 figures.\n\nResearch suggests that people overestimate the relationship between immigration and criminality. A 2016 study of Belgium found that living in an ethnically diverse community lead to a greater fear of crime, unrelated to the actual crime rate. A 2015 study found that the increase in immigration flows into western European countries that took place in the 2000s did \"not affect crime victimization, but it is associated with an increase in the fear of crime, the latter being consistently and positively correlated with the natives’ unfavourable attitude toward immigrants.\" Americans dramatically overestimate the relationship between refugees and terrorism. A 2018 study found that media coverage of immigrants in the United States has a general tendency to emphasize illegality and/or criminal behavior in a way that is inconsistent with actual immigrant demographics.\n\nResearch suggests that the perception that there is a positive causal link between immigration and crime leads to greater support for anti-immigration policies or parties. Research also suggests a vicious cycle of bigotry and immigrant alienation could exacerbate immigrant criminality and bigotry. For instance, University of California, San Diego political scientist Claire Adida, Stanford University political scientist David Laitin and Sorbonne University economist Marie-Anne Valfort argue \"fear-based policies that target groups of people according to their religion or region of origin are counter-productive. Our own research, which explains the failed integration of Muslim immigrants in France, suggests that such policies can feed into a vicious cycle that damages national security. French Islamophobia—a response to cultural difference—has encouraged Muslim immigrants to withdraw from French society, which then feeds back into French Islamophobia, thus further exacerbating Muslims’ alienation, and so on. Indeed, the failure of French security in 2015 was likely due to police tactics that intimidated rather than welcomed the children of immigrants—an approach that makes it hard to obtain crucial information from community members about potential threats.\"\n\nA study of the long-run effects of the 9/11 terrorist attacks found that the post-9/11 increase in hate crimes against Muslims decreased assimilation by Muslim immigrants.<ref name=\"Gould n/a-n/a\"></ref> Controlling for relevant factors, the authors found that \"Muslim immigrants living in states with the sharpest increase in hate crimes also exhibit: greater chances of marrying within their own ethnic group; higher fertility; lower female labour force participation; and lower English proficiency.\"\n\nStates that experience terrorist acts on their own soil or against their own citizens are more likely to adopt stricter restrictions on asylum recognition. Individuals who believe that African Americans and Hispanics are more prone to violence are more likely to support capital punishment.\n\nThe Dillingham Commission singled out immigrants from Southern Europe for their involvement in violent crime (even though the data did not support its conclusions). The Commission's overall findings provided the rationale for sweeping 1920s immigration reduction acts, including the Emergency Quota Act of 1921, which favored immigration from northern and western Europe by restricting the annual number of immigrants from any given country to 3 percent of the total number of people from that country living in the United States in 1910. The movement for immigration restriction that the Dillingham Commission helped to stimulate culminated in the National Origins Formula, part of the Immigration Act of 1924, which capped national immigration at 150,000 annually and completely barred immigration from Asia.\n\n\n"}

His girlfriend is Sruthi (Priyanka Trivedi) who always tries to control his rage as he fights against injustice in society.

The name has been passed down from the early 19th-century to the present day through six generations. The family crest used to represent the line is the inverted ginko leaf design.\n\n was born in 1792, the son of a low-ranking kabuki actor who gave him his initial training. In 1810 he began an apprenticeship under respected actor , and took the name Kataoka Ichizō I.\nHe began his career by performing in minor Osaka area theatres and on stages erected within shrine grounds. In 1820, he became attached to Osaka's theatre. He also travelled throughout Japan, performing in Edo, Kyoto, Nagoya and Ise. He took actors Kataoka Ichizō II and Kataoka Ichōmaru under his wing as disciples.\nHis large build and loud voice were well suited to the and villain roles in which he specialized. He was so admired for these performances that he earned the nickname : King of the Villains. He was, however, also credited with the ability to deliver subtle dramatic performances, particularly in elderly man roles.\nIchizō I held the name from 1810 to 1858 when he took the name . From 1860 to the spring of 1862, Ichizō took a break from performing due to eye problems and encroaching senility. In the 5th lunar month of 1862 he appeared on stage for the last time in the play \"Ōmi Genji Senjin Yakata.\" He died in the 7th lunar month of 1862.\n\nIchizō I was associated with a number of names throughout his life, as per kabuki convention:\n\nKataoka Ichizō I appears in prints by the following artists:\n\nVery little is known of Ichizō II's personal details, including the dates of his birth and death. He began his career with the Kataoka family as a disciple of Ichizō I, but went on to study with the Nakamura clan under Nakamura Utaemon IV. His speciality was supporting \"katakiyaku\" villain roles. After spending some time in the late 1850s performing in Edo to great acclaim, he returned to Osaka where he rejoined the Kataoka family. He took the name early in 1865, almost three years after the death of his predecessor. His name ceased appearing on kabuki playbills in the last years of the Edo period.\n\nIchizō II was associated with the following names throughout his career:\n\n was born in 1851 in the Osaka-area town of . His father was artist , and his two older brothers were kabuki actors and . His first professional appearance was on an Osaka stage in 1855. He was known for his wide-ranging skills, and particularly his portrayal of \"katakiyaku\" villains and \"fukeyaku\" elderly men. Following the sudden death of his brother, Inemaru, Ichizō III was forced to give up kabuki and begin an apprenticeship in the trades. He returned to the stage, however, becoming a disciple of Kataoka Nizaemon VIII in 1886. In 1887, he became Ichizō III, a title he held until his death in December, 1906.\n\n\n was born in the Shitaya district of Tokyo in 1880. Later he was adopted by Ichizō III, who trained him until his debut at Tokyo's Nakamura-za theatre in 1887. He continued to perform until 1904 when the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War resulted in his being sent to the front. In 1906, he was discharged from the military. The general euphoria over Japan's military victory carried over to the theatre, where houses were frequently packed. In 1909, almost 3 full years after the death of his adoptive father, he succeeded to the Ichizō line. He went on to hold this title until his death in 1926, meaning that his career spanned the Meiji and Taishō periods.\nIchizō IV was noted for his loud voice and large personality, which made him well-suited to strong leading roles.

{"id": "2238207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238207", "title": "Khash (dish)", "text": "Khash (dish)\n\nKhash (; ; , Khashi), pacha (; ; ; ; ; ), kalle-pache (; ), or kakaj šürpi () refers to a dish of boiled cow or sheep parts, which might include the head, feet, and stomach (tripe). It is a traditional dish in Afghanistan, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Iran, Iraq, Mongolia, and Turkey.\n\nThe name \"khash\" originates from the Armenian verb (), which means \"to boil\". The dish, initially called \"khashoy\", is mentioned by a number of medieval Armenian authors, including Grigor Magistros (11th century), Mkhitar Heratsi (12th century), and Yesayi Nchetsi (13th century).\n\nThe Persian term literally means \"trotter\". The combination of a sheep's head and trotters is called , which literally means \"head [and] trotter\" in Persian.\n\nKhash is a purist meal with great parsimony in ingredients. The feet are depilated, cleaned, kept in cold water in order to get rid of bad smell, and boiled in water all night long, until the water has become a thick broth and the meat has separated from the bones. No salt or spices are added during the boiling process. The dish is served hot. One may add salt, garlic, lemon juice, or vinegar according to one's taste. Dried lavash is often crumbled into the broth to add substance. Khash is generally served with a variety of other foods, such as hot green and yellow peppers, pickles, radishes, cheese, and fresh greens such as cress. The meal is almost always accompanied by vodka (preferably mulberry vodka) and mineral water.\n\nIn Georgia, Khashi is served together with onions, milk, salt and chacha. Usually they eat this dish early morning, or during hangovers.\n\nIn the medieval Armenian medical textbook \"Relief of Fevers\" (1184), khash was described as a dish with healing properties, e.g., against snuffle. It was recommended to eat it while drinking wine. In case of ailment, khash from the legs of yeanling was advised.\n\nFormerly a nutritious winter food, it is now considered a delicacy, and is enjoyed as a festive winter meal. Modern-day convention in Armenia dictates that it should be consumed during the month that has an \"r\" in its name, thus excluding May, June, July, and August (\"month names in Armenian are derivatives of the Latin names\"). Khash is traditionally consumed during cold months in Azerbaijan and Georgia.\n\nIn the Caucasus, khash is often seen as a food to be consumed in the mornings after a party, as it is known to battle hangovers (especially by men) and eaten with a \"hair of the dog\" vodka chaser.\n\nThere is much ritual involved in khash parties. Many participants abstain from eating the previous evening, and insist upon using only their hands to consume the unusual (and often unwieldy) meal. Because of the potency and strong smell of the meal, and because it is eaten early in the mornings and so often enjoyed in conjunction with alcohol, khash is usually served on the weekend or on holidays.\n\nKalle-pache (; ; literally meaning \"head [and] trotter\") consists of a sheep's head (including the brain) and trotters, and is typically seasoned with lemon and cinnamon. Usually consumed as a breakfast soup, kalle-pache is traditional to Afghanistan and Iran.\n\nIn Iran, kalle-pache is usually cooked in specialty stores, and is served in the morning. It is especially consumed during cold seasons. To prepare kalle-pache, the sheep's head and trotters are collected, cooked, and treated as per the recipe.\n\nDuring winter it is very common to eat sheep or cow parts soup with onions and spices, especially the legs which is called 'Maraq rigl' it is usually accompanied with an alcoholic drink.\n\nPacha is a traditional Iraqi dish made from sheep's head, trotters, and stomach; all boiled slowly and served with bread sunken in the broth. The cheeks and tongues are considered the best parts. Many people prefer not to eat the eyeballs which could be removed before cooking. The stomach lining would be filled with rice and lamb and stitched with a sewing thread (). Sheep brain is also included.\n\nThe dish is known in Kuwait, Bahrain, and other Persian Gulf countries as \"pacha\" (), too. A variation of that is found in other Arab countries such as in Egypt and is known as \"kawari\"' (), Egyptians eat cow brain and sheep brain.\n\nAlbania's popular pache () consists of a sheep's or any cattle's head, that is boiled until meat comes off easily. It is then stewed with garlic, onion, black pepper, and vinegar. Sometimes a little flour is added to thicken the stew. It makes a hot and hearty winter stew.\n\nIn Turkish culinary culture, \"pacha\" ( is a generic word for certain soup preparations, especially with offal, but also without it. In most parts of Turkey, such as in Kastamonu, for instance, the term (\"feet pacha\") is used for cow, sheep, or goat hooves, and the term is used for \"head pacha\" (chorba). Sometimes the term is also used for tongue soup, while \"meat pacha\" is made with (scrag end of sheep's neck). In Turkey, the word refers to a sheep's head roasted in the oven, which is served after grilling at specialized offal restaurants.\n\nThe Greek version, called \"patsás\" (πατσάς), may be seasoned with red wine vinegar and garlic (\"skordostoubi\"), or thickened with avgolémono. The Greek version sometimes uses calf feet with the tripe.\n\nSpecialized tavernas serving patsa are known as \"patsatzidika\". Because patsas has the reputation of remedying hang-over and aiding digestion, \"patsatzidika\" are often working overnight, serving people returning home after dinner or clubbing.\n\n\n"}

As the timing of these festivals fluctuate due to their reliance on lunar calendars, they occasionally occur close to one another. For the sake of convenience, Malaysian media took to combining \"kongsi\" (from the traditional Chinese New Year greeting, \"gong xi fa cai\") and \"raya\", the Malay word for \"celebration\", which is often used to denote the Muslim Eid ul-Fitr festival (\"Hari Raya Aidilfitri\"). As the Hindu festival of Deepavali also occasionally occurs around Eid ul-Fitr, the portmanteau of DeepaRaya has also come into common usage.\n\nMalaysia's national-level Kongsi Raya celebrations are now held in Johor's Danga Bay where they draw up to 300,000 people. A related portmanteau to Kongsi Raya is \"kongsi puasa\", referring to some non-Muslims who also observe the traditional Muslim fast during Ramadhan. (\"Puasa\" being the Malay word for fast.)\n\nLike DeepaRaya, Kongsi Raya has been criticised by some conservative Muslims for allegedly placing a Muslim festival on par with a non-Muslim one. This includes PAS, a major opposition political party, which has expressed concern that the practice of celebrating Kongsi Raya might negatively affect Muslims' aqidah (faith). Islam is the official religion of Malaysia.\n\n\n"}

Interest in latent learning arose largely because the phenomenon seemed to conflict with the widely held view that reinforcement was necessary for learning to occur.\n\nIn a classic study by Edward C. Tolman, three groups of rats were placed in mazes and their behavior observed each day for more than two weeks. The rats in Group 1 always found food at the end of the maze; the rats in Group 2 never found food; and the rats in Group 3 found no food for 10 days, but then received food on the eleventh. The Group 1 rats quickly learned to rush to the end of the maze; Group 2 rats wandered in the maze but did not preferentially go to the end. Group 3 acted the same as the Group 2 rats until food was introduced on Day 11; then they quickly learned to run to the end of the maze and did as well as the Group 1 rats by the next day. This showed that the Group 3 rats had learned about the organisation of the maze, but without the reinforcement of food. Until this study, it was largely believed that reinforcement was necessary for animals to learn such tasks. Other experiments showed that latent learning can happen in shorter durations of time, e.g. 3–7 days. Among other early studies, it was also found that animals allowed to explore the maze and then detained for one minute in the empty goal box learned the maze much more rapidly than groups not given such goal orientation. (so what?)\n\nIn 1949, John Seward conducted studies in which rats were placed in a T-maze with one arm coloured white and the other black. One group of rats had 30 mins to explore this maze with no food present, and the rats were not removed as soon as they had reached the end of an arm. Seward then placed food in one of the two arms. Rats in this exploratory group learned to go down the rewarded arm much faster than another group of rats that had not previously explored the maze. Similar results were obtained by Bendig in 1952 where rats were trained to escape from water in a modified T-maze with food present while satiated for food, then tested while hungry. Upon being returned to the maze while food deprived, the rats learned where the food was located at a rate that increased with the number of pre-exposures given the rat in the training phase. This indicated varying levels of latent learning.\n\nMost early studies of latent learning were conducted with rats, but a study by Stevenson in 1954 explored this method of learning in children. Stevenson required children to explore a series of objects to find a key, and then he determined the knowledge the children had about various non-key objects in the set-up. The children found non-key objects faster if they had previously seen them, indicating they were using latent learning. Their ability to learn in this way increased as they became older.\n\nIn 1982, Wirsig and co-researchers used the taste of sodium chloride to explore which parts of the brain are necessary for latent learning in rats. Decorticate rats were just as able as normal rats to accomplish the latent learning task.\n\nAn experiment with infants explored latent learning at an early age. Three-month-olds were exposed to two different hand puppets simultaneously. The infants were then periodically presented with one of the puppets until they reached 6-months of age, at which point a target behavior was demonstrated on the first puppet. Finally, the infants were presented with the alternative puppet and performed the target behavior on that puppet at a higher rate than the control group which had not seen the two puppets paired. This suggests that the pre-exposed infants had formed an association between the puppets without obvious reinforcement.\n\nAnother experiment suggested that not all potential associations are easily formed by latent learning. Human participants undeprived of caffeine were given a novel caffeinated drink for four days and then were given the drink on a caffeine-deprived fifth day. These participants did not show an increased liking for the flavor upon being caffeine-deprived, while subjects who underwent the same procedure while deprived of caffeine every day showed an increased liking for the flavor each day. In this case, flavor quality as a function of caffeine did not seem to be acquired through latent learning.\n\nThere have been several investigations of the neural processes involved in latent learning. In one study, patients with medial temporal amnesia had particular difficulty with a latent learning task which required representational processing. Another study, conducted with mice, found intriguing evidence that the absence of a prion protein disrupts latent learning and other memory functions in the water maze latent learning task, while phencyclidine was found to impair latent learning in a water finding task.\n"}

The worldwide popular twerking dance has been attributed to the Mapouka dance via popular media, while some argue the historically correct origin remains the bump. \n\nIn the 1980s, artists of the Ivory Coast tried without much success to popularize it after noting the popularity of the bump in the United States. One of the most well known groups is Tueuses de Mapouka. In 1998, the government of Côte d'Ivoire prohibited its performance in public. Following the prohibition, the dance enjoyed very fast-growing global following, especially in the sub-Saharan countries and western nations with large Francophone communities.\n\nThe dance is similar to what is referred to in belly dance as \"shimmies\". The fundamental difference is that in belly dance it is performed while upright and facing the audience, whereas Mapouka is performed more often while bent over and facing away from the audience.

It is the first entry of the \"Power Rangers\" franchise, and became a 1990s pop culture phenomenon alongside a large line of action figures and other merchandise. The show adapted stock footage from the Japanese TV series \"Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger\", which was the 16th installment of Toei's \"Super Sentai\" franchise. The second and third seasons of the show drew elements and stock footage from \"Gosei Sentai Dairanger\" and \"Ninja Sentai Kakuranger\", respectively, though the \"Zyuranger\" costumes were still used for the lead cast in these last two seasons. Only the mecha and the Kiba Ranger costume (worn by the White Ranger) from \"Dairanger\" were featured in the second season, while only the mecha from \"Kakuranger\" was featured in the third season; though the \"Kakuranger\" costumes were later used for the miniseries \"Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers\". The series was produced by MMPR Productions and distributed by Saban Entertainment (later Saban Brands). The show's merchandise was produced and distributed by Bandai Entertainment.\n\nIn 2010, a re-version of \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\", with a new logo, comic book-referenced graphics, and extra alternative special effects, was broadcast on ABC Kids, and Bandai produced brand new toys to coincide with the series. The first 32 of season one's 60 episodes were remade with the re-version graphics. It was the final \"Power Rangers\" season to air on ABC Kids as Haim Saban re-acquired the series from Disney. With the beginning of \"Power Rangers Samurai\", the series had moved to Nickelodeon.\n\nThe series also spawned the feature film \"\", released by 20th Century Fox on June 30, 1995. A new film distributed by Lionsgate, simply titled \"Power Rangers\", was released at Regency Village Theater in Los Angeles on March 22, 2017 and was released nationwide on March 24, 2017.\n\nThe series takes place in the fictional town of Angel Grove, California. On an exploratory mission, two astronauts discover an extraterrestrial container (referred to as a dumpster as a result of its smell) and breach the unit, inadvertently releasing the evil alien sorceress Rita Repulsa from 10,000 years of confinement. Upon her release, she and her army of evil space aliens set their sights on conquering the nearest planet: Earth. The wise sage Zordon, who was responsible for capturing Rita (and also being enemies back on Zordon's homeworld, Eltar), later becomes aware of her release and orders his robotic assistant Alpha 5 to select five \"teenagers with attitude\" to defend the Earth from Rita's attacks. The five teens chosen are Jason Lee Scott, Kimberly Hart, Zack Taylor, Trini Kwan and Billy Cranston. Zordon gives them the ability to transform into a fighting force known as the Power Rangers; providing them with an arsenal of weapons at their disposal, as well as colossal assault machines called Zords which can combine into a giant humanoid machine known as the Megazord.\n\nThe series begins with five teenagers combating Rita and her seemingly endless array of monsters, while also dealing with typical teenage problems and clashing with local bullies Bulk and Skull. However, consecutive failures lead Rita to adopt a new method for conquering Earth and destroying the Power Rangers: by attacking them with one of their own. Using her magic, Rita kidnaps and brainwashes a local teen whose fighting skills prove to equal that of Jason's in a martial-arts contest held in Angel Grove. The new teen, Tommy Oliver, passes Rita's tests, becoming the Green Ranger. Entrusted with Rita's Sword of Darkness, the source for the continuance of the evil spell he has fallen victim to, Tommy comes dangerously close to defeating the Power Rangers, especially when Rita causes a solar eclipse that temporarily drains the Megazord's power. However, the Green Ranger is ultimately defeated, and the Sword of Darkness is destroyed by Jason. Now free from Rita's spell, Tommy chooses to use his Green Ranger powers to assist the other Rangers in defeating the evil that gave them to him in the first place. His Zord, the Dragonzord, is reconfigured to enable it to help form more powerful Zord combinations alongside the other Dinozords.\n\nAs time goes on, Rita focuses on eliminating Tommy in order to regain the powers that she believes belong to her. Using a special wax that was touched by Tommy when he was evil, Rita uses a magic Green Candle to slowly remove his powers, returning them to her. In the end, Tommy loses his powers, but he prevents Rita from reclaiming them by transferring them to Jason who, feeling guilt for failing to protect Tommy's powers, accepts them. However, Tommy later returns to the team when the other Rangers' Power Coins are handed over to Rita in exchange for their kidnapped parents. With Zordon's help, Tommy regains his powers and successfully retrieves the other Rangers' Power Coins. However, Tommy's regained powers are only temporary and must be frequently re-charged by Zordon, who warns that the Green Ranger's powers will ultimately fail. Despite this, Tommy remains determined to continue assisting the other Rangers as long as possible.\n\nLord Zedd, Rita's superior, arrives at Rita's Moon Palace, where he takes her place and throws her into a space dumpster again. He then begins his own campaign to conquer Earth. In order for the Power Rangers to compete with Zedd's monsters, which are superior to the ones Finster made for Rita, Zordon and Alpha upgrade the Dinozords into the more powerful Thunderzords (which combine into the Thunder Megazord). However, Tommy is forced to retain use of the Dragonzord, due to his powers being too weak to support a new Zord.\n\nAfter several defeats, Zedd's attack on the Rangers progressively becomes more violent. He focuses his attention on eliminating Tommy, whom he sees as Rita's biggest mistake in giving him the Dragon Coin. The Green Ranger's powers were rapidly deteriorating, but Zedd's efforts had enhanced the process. He eventually does so with a special Green Crystal, using it to take away the Green Ranger's powers. The crystal also powers up Zedd's Dark Rangers, but when Tommy smashes it, the Dark Rangers powers are transferred back to the regular Rangers. Nevertheless, Zedd finally succeeds in taking the Green Ranger's powers (which Rita later uses to empower Tommy's clone to battle against the Rangers before reclaiming it once more). Following the loss of the Green Ranger's powers, Zordon and Alpha create, in secret, a new White Ranger to aid the other Rangers in battle. The White Ranger is revealed to be Tommy, who in addition receives a new Zord, the Tigerzord, and also becomes the new leader of the Power Rangers (replacing Jason).\n\nDuring the Team Ninja Trials in Angel Grove, the Rangers become friends with three teenagers from Stone Canyon: Rocky DeSantos, Adam Park and Aisha Campbell. During an ensuing battle with Zedd and a magical serpent, Rocky, Adam and Aisha discover the Rangers' identities and, having been entrusted with their secret by Zordon himself, the three newcomers become allies of the Rangers.\n\nLater on, Jason, Zack and Trini are selected to represent Angel Grove at the World Peace Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Rangers are faced with the task of finding replacements. In order to transfer the powers of the Red, Black and Yellow Rangers, they must find the Sword of Light, which is located on the Deserted Planet. Zedd pursues them across the galaxy in Serpentera, his massive personal Zord, and destroys most of the Deserted Planet. Serpentera runs out of power before being able to finish the Rangers, and they return to Earth safely with the Sword of Light. Zordon then chooses Rocky, Adam and Aisha to replace Jason, Zack and Trini as the Red, Black and Yellow Rangers, respectively.\n\nSometime before the power transfer, Rita had returned to Earth when Tommy made his debut as the White Ranger, and fell into the hands of Bulk and Skull, but the Rangers sent her back into space. She later returns to the Moon while the Rangers are in Australia, and with the help of Finster, she gets a special \"makeover\" to gain a younger and \"prettier\" face. She then uses a love potion on Zedd, who is in a deep sleep during his centennial re-evilizer, and he falls in love with her when he wakes up. They get married and thus join forces to make an even more terrible threat for the Rangers, but not even this can prepare them for what is to come.\n\nRito Revolto, Rita's skeletal brother, comes to Earth and, with the help of a group of monsters, destroys the Rangers' Thunderzords and the Tigerzord. As a result, the Dinozords are also destroyed and the Power Coins are damaged beyond repair. Undaunted, the Power Rangers seek the aid of Ninjor, alleged creator of the Power Coins, who gives them new Ninja Coins, providing them with the even more powerful Ninjazords (which combine into the Ninja Megazord) and the Falconzord.\n\nAn Australian girl named Kat Hillard moves to Angel Grove. She befriends Kimberly, and displays an intense affection for Tommy. Later it is found that Rita had captured Kat and put her under a powerful spell, giving her the ability to transform into a normal cat as well as a cat-like monster. Under this spell, she steals Kimberly's Ninja Coin, vastly weakening and nearly killing the Pink Ranger, whose life force, like that of the other Ninja Rangers, is connected to her Ninja Coin. It is during this time that the Rangers acquire their most powerful Zords ever: the Shogunzords (which combine into the Shogun Megazord). Eventually, Kat overcomes Rita's evil spell and returns Kimberly's Ninja Coin to her. A short time thereafter, Kimberly gets a chance to pursue her personal athletic dreams. With Zordon's blessing, she leaves to train for the Pan Global Games, choosing Kat to replace her as the Pink Ranger. Though her initial fear and hesitation keeps her from contributing fully to the fight against evil, Kat eventually becomes both comfortable and capable of fulfilling her duty as a Ranger.\n\nAfter several more battles, Zedd and Rita are joined by Rita's father, Master Vile. Following his failed attempts to defeat the Rangers, he reverses time, turning the Rangers into powerless children. These events culminate in the mini-series \"Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers\".\n\n\n\n\nWhile on a business trip to Japan, Haim Saban came across a broadcast of \"Choudenshi Bioman\", later learning of a popular French-language dub aired on Canal+. Based on the franchise's popularity both in and outside of its native country, Saban realized there was potential for an American adaption. He and his business partner Shuki Levy quickly produced a pilot entitled \"Bio-Man\" in August 1986, which featured an early appearance by actor and martial artist Mark Dacascos in a leading role. According to Levy, they \"shopped it around for at least five years, but nobody wanted it.\" Levy and Saban later re-edited the pilot using footage from the then-contemporary \"Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger\", entitling the pitch \"Galaxy Rangers\". Eventually, the pilot was picked up by Fox Kids for a 40 episode order, after which point it would be determined by the network whether or not to renew the series for additional episodes.\n\nDue to the action-oriented nature of the show, many of the lead actors cast had background in either martial arts, dance, or other physically-intensive activities. Amy Jo Johnson (Kimberly) and David Yost (Billy) were former competitive gymnasts, Austin St. John (Jason) held a second-degree black belt in Taekwondo, and a first-degree black belt in Judo. Walter Emanuel Jones (Zack) was a dancer, and Thuy Trang (Trini) was a kung fu practitioner. Actor Jason Narvy (Skull) originally auditioned for the role of Billy.\n\nThe series was shot on location in Santa Clarita and Los Angeles, California. Recurring locations included Grant High School, Placerita Canyon State Park, Puddingstone Reservoir, and Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park. The House of the Book at Brandeis-Bardin Institute was used as the exterior location for the Command Center. Due to its unusual, futuristic architecture; the building had previously been used in the films \"\" and \"The Lawnmower Man\".\n\nAs part of the initial licensing agreement between Saban and Toei Company, the producers of the \"Super Sentai\", additional footage and insert shots of the villain characters (particularly those played by Machiko Soga, Ami Kawai, and Hideaki Kusaka) were filmed in order to allow more in-depth, extensive scenes of the villains who would be unable to interact with the main cast due to the nature of the show. The additional footage included close-ups of the actor speaking English-language lines phonetically in order to more make the necessary dialogue looping more seamless.\n\nEpisodes 39-40 (\"Doomsday Part 1-2\") were originally intended as the season (and potentially series) finale, with the producers' intending to bring in actress Machiko Soga to reprise her role as Rita in new footage where she would interact directly with the main cast. Due to the unprecedented success of the show and its merchandising, Fox Kids ordered an additional 25 episodes. Since all available stock footage from \"Zyuranger\" had been depleted for use in the first 40 episodes of season one, Saban commissioned Toei to produce 25 new monster costumes and new battle footage using the existing Zyuranger suits. Saban was able to produce 25 additional episodes using new monster suits. This new footage has been referred to as \"Zyu2\" by \"Power Rangers\" fans. Saban used the first 15 for the rest of season one (episodes 41-60), then the remaining suits and footage for the first 13 episodes of season two.\n\nFollowing production of the first 20 episodes of season two, Austin St. John, Thuy Trang and Walter Emanuel Jones left the show over contract disputes. To disguise this incident, a combination of body doubles, voice doubles and stock footage were used to continue featuring the characters Jason, Trini and Zack for eight episodes. The subplot of those three Rangers leaving Angel Grove for the World Peace Conference was made to bridge the transition to their replacements (Rocky, Aisha and Adam). While the reasons for their departure was debated for many years, in 2014, Austin St. John would confirm that the departure was due to the low salaries the stars were being paid; St. John stated \"I could have worked the window at McDonalds and probably made the same money the first season. It was disappointing, it was frustrating, it made a lot of us angry.\" In a 2012 interview with Amy Jo Johnson, she stated St. John, Trang and Jones wanted to become part of a union; this led to them being replaced.\n\nAfter the casting of Steve Cardenas, Karan Ashley and Johnny Yong Bosch, the production moved to Sydney, Australia for roughly four months to shoot \"\", which was released the following summer before the start of season three.\n\nDespite the success of the series, it was also subject to much controversy from parents who felt the show was too violent for young children. The show had aired before television stations issued content warnings such as parental guidance or fit for viewing persons twelve years or over, the V-chip, and television ratings. In the US, numerous complaints were sent to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In 1993, the Canadian broadcast rights to \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" were jointly purchased by the YTV cable channel, and the series played to a receptive audience every weekday afternoons on YTV, the latter trailing the American broadcast by several months. However, due to complaints sent to the recently formed Canadian Broadcast Standards Council and a negative assessment from that body over the show's violent content, YTV removed the series from their line-up. Despite not actually being a member of the CBSC, YTV complied and pulled the series before the end of its first season; Global (which was a CBSC member) ultimately did the same. While a phone-in poll was conducted to see if viewers wanted \"MMPR\" back on YTV, no further installments of the \"Power Rangers\" franchise aired on the network until 2011's \"Power Rangers Samurai\", although commercials for toys and videos were still advertised on it. Later Disney-era versions of the series were broadcast on ABC Family.\n\nEarly on in the series, some fans and critics noted that some racial overtones could be construed in the colors of several of the Rangers in the first few seasons being based on the actors' skin color or ethnicity. Austin St. John, who is of partial Native American ancestry, was cast as the Red Ranger, and Walter Emanuel Jones (an African American) and Thuy Trang (whose family was of Vietnamese ancestry) were the Black and Yellow Rangers respectively. Years later, when brought up on VH1's \"I Love the '90s\", Jones and Amy Jo Johnson (as well as other celebrity commentators) made fun of how the original line-up had Jones' role as the Black Ranger and Trang's role as the Yellow Ranger because the actors and characters were of African and Asian descent, respectively.\n\nIn Malaysia, the phrase \"Mighty Morphin\" was censored and removed from the logo due to the word \"morphin\" being too similar to the name of the drug morphine.\n\nIn mid-October 1994, the murder of a young Norwegian girl by two of her young friends prompted Swedish-owned TV3 to pull \"MMPR\" from its broadcast schedule in all of its market countries. However, \"MMPR\" was not related to the event. Instead, the young children responsible were fans of the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" cartoon.\n\nIn 1994, the New Zealand Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) upheld several complaints from members of the public about the level of violence in the show. The main concern of those complainants was that the show portrayed violence as the primary means of resolving conflict, and that this was influencing children to behave more violently more frequently. Immediately following the BSA decision, the second season of the show was all but cancelled by Television New Zealand. New Zealand is the only country in the world where this show has been prematurely withdrawn from public broadcast to date. DVD and video releases of the more-recent \"Power Rangers\" series that were filmed in New Zealand can be found at The Warehouse, although general sales through video stores and other retailers are scarce. Later series in the \"Power Rangers\" franchise, such as \"\" and \"\", were filmed in New Zealand, but the programs were still not shown in the country, until 2011, when \"Samurai\" premiered.\n\nAs a non-union production, members of the original cast were reportedly subject to low pay, long hours, unfair contracts, and a hostile work environment and, as many of the cast were young, aspiring actors, they had no agents or lawyers to protect their interests and they themselves limited experience in the entertainment industry. Austin St. John, Thuy Trang and Walter Emmanuel Jones were the first to leave the series, citing low pay, in the middle of the second season, and St. John struggled with homelessness for a time after leaving. Amy Jo Johnson later left the series for the same reason, along with concerns over her safety, having almost been set on fire during the filming of \"\". Additionally, despite the show's financial success, members of the original cast did not receive royalty payments for re-runs of episodes they starred in. According to Johnson, St. John, Jones and Trang had wanted the show to become unionized, leading to them being replaced by Steve Cardenas, Johnny Yong Bosch, and Karan Ashley, respectively. \n\nDavid Yost was the last of the original Power Rangers to leave the series (during \"Power Rangers Zeo\"), citing homophobic attitudes from production staff, prompting him to unsuccessfully undergo conversion therapy in an effort to change his sexuality. In a 2010 interview with fan blog \"No Pink Spandex\", Yost stated that he walked off set one day because \"[he] was called 'faggot' one too many times.\" He also stated that the producers would often ask other cast members what they thought about his homosexuality, and this made him uncomfortable as well. Shortly after this interview, producer Scott Page-Pagter stated that Yost left over a pay dispute and that the allegations of homophobia are false; he added that Yost did not get along with any of the crew.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996, Saban Home Entertainment and WarnerVision Entertainment released VHS tapes of the series in the U.S. In 2000, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released seven compilation VHS tapes. In 2012, Shout! Factory released 19 discs to Comic-Con International and a 20 disc set exclusively to Time Life of all three seasons and \"Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers\". In that same year, Shout! reissued the 19 discs to wider retail. They also released two volumes for both season one and season two of the series, as well as the complete third season. In January 2014, the entire series, as well as the remaining 17 seasons in the entire \"Power Rangers\" franchise, was released in 98 disc set. The series has also been released on VHS in the UK and Australia, and Region 2 DVD. The first 30 episodes of season one have been released to Region 4 DVD.\n\nThe following video games have been developed based on the television series.\n\nSeveral comic book series were based on \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\". From 1994 to 1995, Hamilton Comics produced three separate series totaling thirteen issues altogether. Marvel Comics produced two series, the first with seven issues based on the second season and the second with five issues called \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Ninja Rangers/VR Troopers\" which was a flip book with adventures based on the third season on one side and of \"VR Troopers\" on the other. The Power Rangers also appeared in the \"Masked Rider\" comic book from Marvel. In March 2016, BOOM! comics released a new \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" comic series based off the original series but serves as a reboot taking place in the modern world. In July 2017, a second series titled \"Go Go Power Rangers\" was released and takes place before Tommy joins the team.\n\n\n\n"}

In September 1794, Luigi Zamboni and Giambattista de Rolandis created a flag by uniting the white and red of the flag of Bologna with green, a symbol of liberty and hope that the populace of Italy join the revolution begun in Bologna to oust the foreign occupying forces. This tricolore was considered a symbol of redemption that from its creation was \"consecrated to immortality of the triumph of faith, virtue, and sacrifice\" of those who created it.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, in a letter from Milan to an executive director on 11 October 1796, stated that the Legione Lombarda had chosen these colours as the national colours. In a solemn ceremony at the Piazza del Duomo on 16 November 1796, a military flag was presented to the Legione Lombarda, which would become a unit in the Cisalpine Republic (1797–1802) military, and was the first tricolore military standard to fly at the head of an Italian military unit. The first official Italian flag was created for the Cispadane Republic (1796–1797) in Reggio Emilia on 7 January 1797 based on a proposal by government deputy Giuseppe Compagnoni.\n\nThe formation of the Cisalpine Republic was decreed by Napoleon on 29 June 1797, and consisted of most of the Cispadane Republic and Transpadane Republic (1796–1797), which included between them Milan, Mantua, the portion of Parma north of the Po river, Bologna, Ferrara, and Romagna, and later the Venetian Republic. Its flag was proclaimed to be the tricolore, representing the \"red and white of Bologna and the green of liberty\".\n\nYoung Italy, a political movement founded in 1831 by Giuseppe Mazzini calling for a national revolution to unify all Italian-speaking provinces, used a \"theatrical\" uniform based on the national colours. These colours had been in use in the Cispadane Republic, Transpadane Republic, Cisalpine Republic, Italian Republic (1802–1805), and the Kingdom of Italy (1805–1814), precursors to the modern state. During the formation of the Roman Empire of 1814, the foundational constitutional basis specified that the three national colours would be preserved.\n\nThe colours have been used for political purposes.\n\nDuring his visit to London on 11 April 1864, Giuseppe Garibaldi was greeted by a throng of people at the train station, many of whom carried Italian flags. English men dressed in red shirts commonly worn by Garibaldi's followers during his Mille expedition to southern Italy, and women dressed in the national colours of Italy. Italian flags could be seen throughout the city. In 1848, Garibaldi's legion dressed in red shirts with green and white facing.\n\nIn 1868, two years after the Austrians departed Venice following the Third Italian War of Independence, the remains of statesman Daniele Manin were brought to his native city and honoured with a public funeral. He had been acclaimed president of the Venetian Republic of San Marco by residents of Venice after a revolt in 1848. The gondola carrying his coffin was decorated with bow \"surmounted by the lion of Saint Mark, resplendent with gold\", bore \"the Venetian standard veiled with black crape\", and had \"two silver colossal statues waving the national colours of Italy\". The statues represented the unification of Italy and Venice. The funeral procession was described as \"magnificent\". His remains are interred at the Basilica of Santa Croce, the first person buried there in over 300 years.\n\nAn apocryphal story about the history of pizza holds that on 11 June 1889, Neapolitan pizzamaker Raffaele Esposito created a pizza to honour Margherita of Savoy, who was visiting the city. It was garnished with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil to represent the national colours of Italy, and was named \"Pizza Margherita\".\n\nIn 2003, the government of Italy specified the colours using Pantone. The new specification was demonstrated on sample flags displayed at Palazzo Montecitorio; they had a darker tint than the traditional colours, described as having a deeper green, a red with \"ruby hues\", and ivory or cream instead of white. Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, president of the Federation of the Greens and a member of the Chamber of Deputies, stated that Silvio Berlusconi had achieved a \"chromatic coup d'état\". Government officials stated that the sample flags did not conform to the \"specified chromatic specification\". The values were revised after discussion, and in 2006 were decreed by law in Article 31 of \"Disposizioni generali in materia di cerimoniale e di precedenza tra le cariche pubbliche\" (\"General provisions relating to ceremonial materials and precedence for public office\", published 28 July 2006 in Gazzetta Ufficiale) for polyester fabric bunting to use the following Pantone Textile Colour System values:\n\nThe national colours are specified in the Constitution of Italy to be used on the Flag of Italy, a vertical tricolour flag of green, white, and red. It is also used on the cockade, another of the national symbols of Italy. Its use of the national colours was the antecedent for its use in the flag.\n\nThe Presidential Standard of Italy is the flag used by the President of the Italian Republic, the nation's head of state. It is based on the square flag of the Napoleonic Italian Republic, on a field of blue charged with the coat of arms of Italy in gold.\n\nOn 31 December 1996, legislation was passed (\"legge no. 671\") instituting 7 January as national flag day, known as \"Festa del Tricolore\", and was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana three days later. Its purpose was to celebrate the bicentennial of the establishment of the Italian flag on 7 January 1797. The most important of these celebrations is that at the Sala del Tricolore (\"Room of the tricolour\") in the commune palace of Reggio Emilia, and a solemn changing of the guard at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, followed by a parade of the Corazzieri and a brass band fanfare by the Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment.\n\nIn football, the winners of Serie A are the Italian football champions, which entitles the winning team to adorn the jersey of each of its players with the \"scudetto\", an escutcheon (heater shield) of the Italian flag, the subsequent season. The practice was established in 1924, after Gabriele D'Annunzio had wanted to put a shield flag on the uniforms of Italian military commanders during a friendly match. The league operators state that it is \"representative of national unity at the level of football\". The winner of the Coppa Italia is entitled to adorn its team jersey with a tricolour cockade for the subsequent season.\n\nAfter having played its first two international matches in white in 1910, the men's football team announced its new uniform on 31 December 1910, an azure shirt with an escutcheon of the Italian colours, and white shorts. Widespread opinion was that the blue colour had been chosen as an homage to the House of Savoy that had previously ruled parts of northern Italy until the nation's unification. The uniform was first worn on 6 January 1911 in a match against Hungary in Milan.\n\nIn sport, many men's national teams are known as the \"azzurri\" and women's teams as the \"azzurre\" (meaning \"azure\"). These include the men's basketball, men's football, men's ice hockey, men's rugby league, men's rugby union, and men's volleyball teams, and the women's basketball, women's football, women's ice hockey, and women's volleyball teams.\n\nThe national auto racing colour of Italy is rosso corsa (\"racing red\").\n\nThe Frecce Tricolori, the aerobatics demonstration team of the Italian Aeronautica Militare based at Rivolto Air Force Base, are so named for the green, white, and red smoke trails emitted during performances, representing the national colours.\n\nThe name of \"Italia Peak\", a peak in the Elk Mountains of Colorado in the United States, is derived from the display on one of its faces, when seen at a distance, of \"brilliant red, white and green colors, the national colors of Italy\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27722070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27722070", "title": "Resident Evil: Revelations", "text": "Resident Evil: Revelations\n\nResident Evil: Revelations is a survival horror video game developed by Capcom and originally released for the Nintendo 3DS handheld game console in 2012. Set between the \"Resident Evil\" titles \"Resident Evil 4\" and \"Resident Evil 5\", the game follows counter-terrorism agents Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield as they try to stop a bioterrorist organization from infecting the Earth's oceans with a virus. The game features a single-player mode where the player must complete a series of episodes that involve solving puzzles and defeating enemies, and a multiplayer mode where players may fight their way through altered single-player scenarios.\n\n\"Revelations\" emphasizes survival, evasion, and exploration over fast-paced combat by providing the player with limited ammunition, health, and movement speed. It was designed to bring back the content and horror of the series' roots, while at the same time trying to modernize the gameplay. \"Revelations\" was also the first game to support the Nintendo 3DS Circle Pad Pro outside Japan. The game was a moderate commercial success and received generally positive reviews from video game publications. Several critics praised its graphics, sound effects, and horror setting, but some criticized its inconsistent gameplay between scenarios.\n\nA high definition (HD) version was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Xbox 360 in 2013, and for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch in 2017. This version does not support the 3D capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS but features upgraded graphics and other minor changes. Across all platforms, the HD version sold more than two million copies worldwide but received less critical praise than the Nintendo 3DS version. A sequel, \"\", was released in 2015.\n\n\"Resident Evil: Revelations\" is a survival horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective to interact with the environment and enemies. In the game's single-player campaign, the player must complete a series of scenarios collected together into episodes. Most of the scenarios involve the player controlling Jill Valentine aboard a ghost ship in the Mediterranean Sea, but some require the player to play as other characters in different settings. To finish a scenario and proceed to the next one, the player must complete certain objectives such as solving puzzles, defeating a boss, collecting keys that open doors to new areas, and reaching a specific point in the game, among others.\n\nAs a survival horror game, \"Revelations\" emphasizes survival, evasion, and exploration over fast-paced combat by providing the player with limited ammunition, health, and movement speed. The player has the ability to run, climb ladders, swim and dive underwater for a limited period of time. Up to three firearms can be carried at one time, in addition to grenades and the standard combat knife. Firearms range from handguns to shotguns, submachine guns and rifles. When aiming a firearm to shoot enemies, the gameplay switches into either a first-person or an over-the-shoulder perspective. As Valentine, the player can upgrade firearms by finding special items throughout the game. The player may also perform melee attacks when an enemy has been stunned after being shot at the right time. Ammunition and health suppliers are dispersed among the game to help players increase their resources. A device called Genesis can be used to scan and find items hidden throughout the game's environments. An automap feature is available to help players navigate the game.\n\nIn addition to the single-player campaign, \"Revelations\" offers a more action-oriented mode, called Raid Mode, where one or two players may fight their way through a selection of altered scenarios from the single-player campaign. These usually feature enemies of varying power for the player to defeat. Once a scenario has been completed, the player is rewarded with experience and battle points that can be exchanged for various weapons and items at a store. Gaining experience and acquiring new equipment allow players to progress to higher and more challenging scenarios. As the player progresses throughout the game, the player may also unlock numerous characters for use in both the single-player campaign and Raid Mode, with each character having a different set of abilities and melee attack. The game supports a StreetPass functionality that allows different players to exchange items for use in the game.\n\n\"Revelations\" is set between \"Resident Evil 4\" and \"Resident Evil 5\", shortly after the establishment of the counter-terrorism group Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA). One year prior to the game's events, the Federal Bioterrorism Commission (FBC) sent agents Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat to keep the city of Terragrigia under control after the bioterrorist organization Il Veltro launched an attack using genetically modified living creatures in opposition to Terragrigia's solar energy development. In the present, BSAA head Clive R. O'Brian sends out BSAA agents Jill Valentine and Parker to search for BSAA agents Chris Redfield and Jessica at their last known location, the cruise ship \"Queen Zenobia\" in the Mediterranean Sea. They have reportedly gone missing during their mission to investigate Veltro's possible reappearance.\n\nAboard the ship, Jill and Parker enter a room where they believe Chris is being held, realizing too late that it was a trap set by a Veltro operative. Meanwhile, Chris and Jessica find a base of operations for Veltro; the Valkoinen Mökki airstrip in the mountains. Being informed by O'Brian that Jill and Parker are missing in the Mediterranean, they are redeployed to investigate their whereabouts. O'Brian also sends BSAA agents Quint Cetcham and Keith Lumley to Valkoinen Mökki to gather information. Awakening in separate locked rooms, Jill and Parker manage to regroup and witness a video transmission of a Veltro member threatening to infect one-fifth of the Earth's oceans with the T-Abyss, which was created in retaliation to the FBC for their involvement in the destruction of Veltro's forces on Terragrigia. Jill and Parker reach the ship's antenna to request evacuation but learn that FBC director Morgan Lansdale activated a satellite attack on the \"Queen Zenobia\", which floods the ship with water.\n\nChris and Jessica arrive at the \"Queen Zenobia\" and eventually meet with Jill and Parker. The team is confronted by the Veltro operative, but Jessica shoots him before he reveals details of a larger conspiracy. Parker unmasks him to discover that he was his FBC partner Raymond Vester. He seemingly dies after whispering something to him. Afterward, Chris and Jill make their way to the ship's laboratory to stop the virus from contaminating the sea, while Parker and Jessica search for a way to stop the ship from sinking. As told by Vester, Parker turns his gun on Jessica, suspecting her of being an FBC mole. Jessica wounds Parker and initiates a self-destruct sequence before escaping. Vester reveals himself to be alive and working with O'Brian. Having found the laboratory, Chris and Jill are confronted by Lansdale via a video uplink, revealing that he worked with Veltro in the Terragrigia panic in an effort to increase the FBC's funding and international influence. The pair neutralizes the virus and proceeds to an extraction point.\n\nO'Brian informs Chris and Jill that he had orchestrated the events in an effort to gather evidence of Lansdale's involvement in Terragrigia. He also informs them of the results from Keith and Quint's data analysis: the existence of a sister ship below the ruins of Terragrigia, which was destroyed by Lansdale to eliminate incriminating evidence of his involvement. However, Lansdale then proceeds to arrest O'Brian, cutting off communications. In the sister ship, Jill and Chris search for Veltro leader Jack Norman, knowing that he holds evidence against Lansdale. However, he has gone delusional and survived a year by injecting himself with T-Abyss. After a long battle, Chris and Jill defeat him and broadcast the video, exposing Lansdale. As a result, O'Brian is released and the FBC is dissolved. In the end, it is revealed that Parker was ultimately saved by Vester. In a post-credits scene, Vester approaches Jessica at a cafe and gives her a sample of the T-Abyss. She asks him why he saved Parker, with him replying that he \"had his reasons\".\n\n\"Revelations\" was developed by Capcom and directed by Koshi Nakanishi, who previously worked as a game designer for \"Resident Evil 5\". The game was developed simultaneously with \"\" and the people who worked on the game were not involved with the development of \"Resident Evil 6\". The development team chose to develop the game for the Nintendo 3DS because they felt that its 3D capabilities could produce a \"tense, scary experience with a realistic atmosphere that could make players feel like there could be something lurking around every corner.\" The developers decided to give the game an episodic structure with short and varied chapters to make it suitable for playing on a portable game console. The Raid mode was designed so that players could \"bring the game to their friend's house and enjoy it with friends face to face, as they talk.\"\n\nThe developer's main goal was to bring back the content and horror of the series' roots, while at the same time trying to modernize the gameplay. A cruise ship was chosen as the main setting of the game because it could provide claustrophobic corridors and make the player helpless in the middle of the ocean. The ship's main hall was inspired by the Palais Garnier opera house in Paris. To increase the horror aspect of the game, enemies were designed to moan and emit terrifying sounds even before being spotted by the player. Nakanishi remarked that this mechanic allows players to determine which enemies are coming for them from their sound alone. Although zombies are the main enemies in the first \"Resident Evil\" games, the team opted to create \"water-logged\" creatures with deformed structures for \"Revelations\" to widen the variety of enemies of the franchise.\n\n\"Revelations\" uses a ported and downsized version of the internally developed MT Framework graphics engine, which was originally designed for high definition (HD) games such as \"Devil May Cry 4\" and \"Lost Planet 2\". Capcom's previous experience with \"The Mercenaries 3D\" helped the development team improve the technical and graphical aspects of the game to a greater extent. According to Nakanishi, \"It was thanks to the tremendous efforts of our technical team that we were able to get console-quality graphics from portable hardware.\" Some techniques were used to reduce performance costs; for example, the Genesis scanner reduces the on-screen display complexity, while some creatures were designed to have simplistic skeletal physics and no HD textures. A pair of glasses for Jill was originally suggested as the Genesis scanner.\n\nUnlike in previous \"Resident Evil\" titles, the developers designed \"Revelations\" so that the player could move and shoot at the same time. Producer Masachika Kawata explained that the reason why the mechanic was not adopted earlier was that it would make the game too fast for a survival horror game. Nevertheless, the developers balanced the gameplay of the game by slowing down the speed of the player movement and by making enemies move in a complex and spooky manner, \"as if they're trying to avoid your attack.\" The developers decided to support the Circle Pad Pro accessory as soon as it was conceived because improving the game controls was a major priority.\n\nIn December 2010, it was reported that only 20% of the game was complete. Numerous features were not included in the final product due to time and budget constraints. The developers originally planned to add a special weapon designed to be used underwater and acquired from Chris at the end of the eighth episode, but the plot of the game changed during development and the team had to discard it. Additionally, the land in the distance that can be seen from the ship in the first episode was originally going to be the setting of the last episode, where Jill would have found something from her past.\n\n\"Revelations\" was announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010 trade show in Los Angeles. A playable demo referred to as a \"pilot version\" by Capcom was released with \"Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D\" in 2011. Another playable demo of the game was made available for download from the Nintendo eShop service in January 2012 in North America and Europe. IGN editors nominated the game for Best 3DS Game at their Best of E3 2011 Awards and later listed it as one of the 30 most anticipated games of 2012. Prior to its release, Capcom sent North American copies of \"Revelations\" to reviewers with the game's title, as printed on the cover's spine, misspelled as \"Revelaitons\". To make up for the error, Capcom offered to replace the cover with a corrected version to users in North America.\n\n\"Revelations\" was released on January 26, 2012, in Japan, January 27, 2012, in Europe, and February 7, 2012, in North America. It was the first game to support the Circle Pad Pro outside Japan. A bundle containing the accessory and the game was exclusively released in Europe. According to Media Create, the game sold 296,040 copies in Japan in 2012. In the United States, the game was among the 25 best-selling video games of February 2012 and sold 122,000 units in March 2012. Although sales of \"Revelations\" were considered successful for a Nintendo 3DS game, Capcom wanted it to sell \"a little more\" given the game's large development costs.\n\n\"Revelations\" received generally positive reviews from video game critics. Jane Douglas of GameSpot felt that the game is \"a thoroughly successful crossbreeding of old-school chills and new-school action\", highlighting its brooding atmosphere and slow-paced combat. Josh Laddin of Game Revolution went so far as to say that the game is sometimes even superior to the old-school \"Resident Evil\" games. Writing for IGN, Richard George described \"Revelations\" as \"a great handheld game, one that not only pushes the boundaries and standards of the Nintendo 3DS but one that recaptures a long-forgotten spirit of a classic franchise.\" However, he also criticized the scenarios not involving the cruise ship setting and remarked that the constant alterations of characters and gameplay between scenarios hold the game \"back from true greatness\", stating that the game \"doesn't understand its strengths\".\n\nSeveral critics declared the game's graphics to be some of the best on the Nintendo 3DS. Eurogamer reviewer Rich Stanton praised the environments for their lighting and particle effects, while GameSpot credited the highly detailed character models, especially those of Jill and some enemies. IGN also highlighted the sound design, saying that \"Capcom has mastered the ability to play up a soundtrack when appropriate, sometimes completely cutting to isolated noises in order to focus a player on something truly haunting.\" Game Revolution stated similar pros, noting that the game is best experienced when played in the dark with headphones on. Tim Turi of \"Game Informer\" praised the story for its episodic structure and pacing, but also admitted that BSAA agents Quint and Keith are the worst characters in the series' history. The fact that the game supports the Circle Pad Pro was seen as a valuable feature, as it gives players the ability to move, shoot and control the camera at the same time.\n\nIn a mixed review, \"Edge\" felt that the gameplay \"takes the best and worst of \"Resident Evil\"s past and present, and spot welds them together unevenly. If the designers had committed wholeheartedly to either polarity of action or horror, \"Revelations\" may have been a headshot, but what we're left with is more like a glancing blow.\" GameSpot praised the gameplay for its stop-and-shoot action and use of the Genesis scanner, saying that it \"nicely complements the resource scavenging that underpins your survival.\" \"Game Informer\" felt that the weapon customization allows for different playstyles, but also criticized the game's lack of enemy variety in comparison to other games in the series. Jonathan Deesing of G4 praised the exploration of the cruise ship setting, comparing it favorably to \"Super Metroid\". However, he criticized the controls for being frustrating and the AI-controlled companions for being useless. Similarly, IGN remarked that the fact that the player is accompanied by a partner makes the game less scary. The Raid Mode was seen as a valuable addition to the game. Eurogamer stated that the mode \"is a great concept for 3DS\" and the game \"executes it with conviction\" due to its unlockable features, challenge, and replayability.\n\nAn HD version of the game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Xbox 360 on May 21, 2013 in North America, May 23, 2013 in Japan, and May 24, 2013 in Europe. The HD version features upgraded graphics, additional Raid Mode content such as new weapons and characters, and a new difficulty mode which remixes enemy and item placement in the single-player campaign. The HD version does not support the 3D capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS, but the Wii U version of the game offers additional features using the Wii U GamePad, including dual screen gameplay, Off-TV Play and Miiverse functionality. The HD version was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in Japan on August 31, 2017 and in the US and Europe on August 29, 2017. A Nintendo Switch version was released on November 28, 2017.\n\nCritical reception towards the HD version was not as positive. Taylor Cocke of IGN criticized it for its dated graphics and uneven controls, saying that the game is \"simply out of its element\". Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer criticized the slow character movement, but admitted that the game still stands out compared to the previous main installments in the series, which he described as a \"directionless, desperate mess\". In 2016, readers of the Japanese video game magazine \"Famitsu\" selected \"Revelations\" as the sixth most memorable game for PlayStation 3. As of December 2017, the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and Microsoft Windows versions combined had sold 1.7 million copies worldwide, while, as of February 2018, the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch versions combined had sold 500,000 copies. A sequel, \"\", was released in 2015.\n\n"}

Sediment controls are usually employed together with erosion controls, which are designed to prevent or minimize erosion and thus reduce the need for sediment controls. Sediment controls are generally designed to be temporary measures, however, some can be used for storm water management purposes.\n\n\nChemical treatment of sediment, commonly called an active treatment system, is a relatively new form of sediment control for the construction industry. It is designed to reduce turbidity in nearby water bodies and involves collection of sediment-laden stormwater in a basin or tank, and adding a chemical flocculant. An example video of chemical dosing on slow settling solids is on YouTube. This causes the sediment to settle so it can be more easily removed from the water. Some of the flocculent chemicals used for sediment treatment are chitosan and polymers such as polyacrylamide. The water is then pumped through a removal system, such as a Siltbuster, sand or cartridge filter, prior to discharge. Chemical sediment control is currently used on some construction sites around the United States and Europe, typically larger sites where there is a high potential for damage to nearby streams.\n\nAnother active treatment system design uses electrocoagulation to flocculate suspended particles in the stormwater, followed by a filtration stage.\n\nAll states in the U.S. have laws requiring installation of erosion and sediment controls (ESCs) on construction sites of a specified size. Federal regulations require ESCs on sites and larger. Smaller sites which are part of a common plan of development (e.g. a residential subdivision) are also required to have ESCs. In some states, non-contiguous sites under are also required to have ESCs. For example, the State of Maryland requires ESCs on sites of or more. The sediment controls must be installed before the beginning of land disturbance (i.e. land clearing, grubbing and grading) and must be maintained during the entire disturbance phase of construction.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15287", "title": "Series (mathematics)", "text": "Series (mathematics)\n\nIn mathematics, a series is, roughly speaking, a description of the operation of adding infinitely many quantities, one after the other, to a given starting quantity. The study of series is a major part of calculus and its generalization, mathematical analysis. Series are used in most areas of mathematics, even for studying finite structures (such as in combinatorics), through generating functions. In addition to their ubiquity in mathematics, infinite series are also widely used in other quantitative disciplines such as physics, computer science, statistics and finance.\n\nFor a long time, the idea that such a potentially infinite summation could produce a finite result was considered paradoxical by mathematicians and philosophers. This paradox was resolved using the concept of a limit during the 19th century. Zeno's paradox of Achilles and the tortoise illustrates this counterintuitive property of infinite sums: Achilles runs after a tortoise, but when he reaches the position of the tortoise at the beginning of the race, the tortoise has reached a second position; when he reaches this second position, the tortoise is at a third position, and so on. Zeno concluded that Achilles could \"never\" reach the tortoise, and thus that movement does not exist. Zeno divided the race into infinitely many sub-races, each requiring a finite amount of time, so that the total time for Achilles to catch the tortoise is given by a series. The resolution of the paradox is that, although the series has an infinite number of terms, it has a finite sum, which gives the time necessary for Achilles to catch the tortoise. \n\nIn modern terminology, any (ordered) infinite sequence formula_1 of terms (that is numbers, functions, or anything that can be added) defines a series, which is the operation of adding the formula_2 one after the other. To emphasize that there are an infinite number of terms, a series may be called an infinite series. Such a series is represented (or denoted) by an expression like \nor, using the summation sign,\n\nThe infinite sequence of additions implied by a series cannot be effectively carried on (at least in a finite amount of time). However, if the set to which the terms and their finite sums belong has a notion of limit, it is sometimes possible to assign a value to a series, called the \"sum\" of the series. This value is the limit as tends to infinity (if the limit exists) of the finite sums of the first terms of the series, which are called the \"th partial sums\" of the series. That is, \nWhen this limit exists, one says that the series is \"convergent\" or \"summable\", or that the sequence formula_1 is summable. In this case, the limit is called the \"sum of the series\". Otherwise, the series is said to be \"divergent\".\n\nGenerally, the terms of a series come from a ring, often the field formula_7 of the real numbers or the field formula_8 of the complex numbers. In this case, the set of all series is itself a ring (and even an associative algebra), in which the addition consists of adding the series term by term, and the multiplication is the Cauchy product.\n\nAn infinite series or simply a series is an infinite sum, represented by an infinite expression of the form\nwhere formula_10 is any ordered sequence of terms, such as numbers, functions, or anything else that can be added (an abelian group). This is an expression that is obtained from the list of terms formula_11 by laying them side by side, and conjoining them with the symbol \"+\". A series may also be represented by using summation notation, such as\n\nIf an abelian group \"A\" of terms has a concept of limit (for example, if it is a metric space), then some series, the convergent series, can be interpreted as having a value in \"A\", called the \"sum of the series\". This includes the common cases from calculus in which the group is the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. Given a series formula_13 its \"k\"th partial sum is\nBy definition, the series formula_15 \"converges\" to the limit (or simply \"sums\" to ), if the sequence of its partial sums has a limit . In this case, one usually writes \nA series is said to be \"convergent\" if it converges to some limit or \"divergent\" when it does not. The value of this limit, if it exists, is then the value of the series.\n\nA series is said to converge or to \"be convergent\" when the sequence of partial sums has a finite limit. If the limit of is infinite or does not exist, the series is said to diverge. When the limit of partial sums exists, it is called the value (or sum) of the series\n\nAn easy way that an infinite series can converge is if all the \"a\" are zero for \"n\" sufficiently large. Such a series can be identified with a finite sum, so it is only infinite in a trivial sense.\n\nWorking out the properties of the series that converge even if infinitely many terms are non-zero is the essence of the study of series. Consider the example\n\nIt is possible to \"visualize\" its convergence on the real number line: we can imagine a line of length 2, with successive segments marked off of lengths 1, ½, ¼, etc. There is always room to mark the next segment, because the amount of line remaining is always the same as the last segment marked: when we have marked off ½, we still have a piece of length ½ unmarked, so we can certainly mark the next ¼. This argument does not prove that the sum is \"equal\" to 2 (although it is), but it does prove that it is \"at most\" 2. In other words, the series has an upper bound. Given that the series converges, proving that it is equal to 2 requires only elementary algebra. If the series is denoted , it can be seen that\n\nTherefore,\n\nMathematicians extend the idiom discussed earlier to other, equivalent notions of series. For instance, when we talk about a recurring decimal, as in\n\nwe are talking, in fact, just about the series\n\nBut since these series always converge to real numbers (because of what is called the completeness property of the real numbers), to talk about the series in this way is the same as to talk about the numbers for which they stand. In particular, the decimal expansion 0.111… can be identified with /. This leads to an argument that , which only relies on the fact that the limit laws for series preserve the arithmetic operations; this argument is presented in the article 0.999...\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\nPartial summation takes as input a sequence, { \"a\" }, and gives as output another sequence, { \"S\" }. It is thus a unary operation on sequences. Further, this function is linear, and thus is a linear operator on the vector space of sequences, denoted Σ. The inverse operator is the finite difference operator, Δ. These behave as discrete analogs of integration and differentiation, only for series (functions of a natural number) instead of functions of a real variable. For example, the sequence {1, 1, 1, ...} has series {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} as its partial summation, which is analogous to the fact that formula_49\n\nIn computer science it is known as prefix sum.\n\nSeries are classified not only by whether they converge or diverge, but also by the properties of the terms a (absolute or conditional convergence); type of convergence of the series (pointwise, uniform); the class of the term a (whether it is a real number, arithmetic progression, trigonometric function); etc.\n\nWhen \"a\" is a non-negative real number for every \"n\", the sequence \"S\" of partial sums is non-decreasing. It follows that a series ∑\"a\" with non-negative terms converges if and only if the sequence \"S\" of partial sums is bounded.\n\nFor example, the series\n\nis convergent, because the inequality\n\nand a telescopic sum argument implies that the partial sums are bounded by 2. The exact value of the original series is the Basel problem.\n\nA series\nis said to converge absolutely if the series of absolute values\nconverges. This is sufficient to guarantee not only that the original series converges to a limit, but also that any reordering of it converges to the same limit.\n\nA series of real or complex numbers is said to be conditionally convergent (or semi-convergent) if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent. A famous example is the alternating series\n\nwhich is convergent (and its sum is equal to ln 2), but the series formed by taking the absolute value of each term is the divergent harmonic series. The Riemann series theorem says that any conditionally convergent series can be reordered to make a divergent series, and moreover, if the \"a\" are real and \"S\" is any real number, that one can find a reordering so that the reordered series converges with sum equal to \"S\".\n\nAbel's test is an important tool for handling semi-convergent series. If a series has the form\n\nwhere the partial sums \"B\" = are bounded, \"λ\" has bounded variation, and exists:\n\nthen the series is convergent. This applies to the pointwise convergence of many trigonometric series, as in\n\nwith 0 < \"x\" < 2π. Abel's method consists in writing \"b\" = \"B\" − \"B\", and in performing a transformation similar to integration by parts (called summation by parts), that relates the given series to the absolutely convergent series\n\n\nA series of real- or complex-valued functions\n\nconverges pointwise on a set \"E\", if the series converges for each \"x\" in \"E\" as an ordinary series of real or complex numbers. Equivalently, the partial sums\nconverge to \"ƒ\"(\"x\") as \"N\" → ∞ for each \"x\" ∈ \"E\".\n\nA stronger notion of convergence of a series of functions is called uniform convergence. The series converges uniformly if it converges pointwise to the function \"ƒ\"(\"x\"), and the error in approximating the limit by the \"N\"th partial sum,\ncan be made minimal \"independently\" of \"x\" by choosing a sufficiently large \"N\".\n\nUniform convergence is desirable for a series because many properties of the terms of the series are then retained by the limit. For example, if a series of continuous functions converges uniformly, then the limit function is also continuous. Similarly, if the \"ƒ\" are integrable on a closed and bounded interval \"I\" and converge uniformly, then the series is also integrable on \"I\" and can be integrated term-by-term. Tests for uniform convergence include the Weierstrass' M-test, Abel's uniform convergence test, Dini's test, and the Cauchy criterion.\n\nMore sophisticated types of convergence of a series of functions can also be defined. In measure theory, for instance, a series of functions converges almost everywhere if it converges pointwise except on a certain set of measure zero. Other modes of convergence depend on a different metric space structure on the space of functions under consideration. For instance, a series of functions converges in mean on a set \"E\" to a limit function \"ƒ\" provided\nas \"N\" → ∞.\n\nA power series is a series of the form\n\nThe Taylor series at a point \"c\" of a function is a power series that, in many cases, converges to the function in a neighborhood of \"c\". For example, the series\nis the Taylor series of formula_65 at the origin and converges to it for every \"x\".\n\nUnless it converges only at \"x\"=\"c\", such a series converges on a certain open disc of convergence centered at the point \"c\" in the complex plane, and may also converge at some of the points of the boundary of the disc. The radius of this disc is known as the radius of convergence, and can in principle be determined from the asymptotics of the coefficients \"a\". The convergence is uniform on closed and bounded (that is, compact) subsets of the interior of the disc of convergence: to wit, it is uniformly convergent on compact sets.\n\nHistorically, mathematicians such as Leonhard Euler operated liberally with infinite series, even if they were not convergent. When calculus was put on a sound and correct foundation in the nineteenth century, rigorous proofs of the convergence of series were always required.\n\nWhile many uses of power series refer to their sums, it is also possible to treat power series as \"formal sums\", meaning that no addition operations are actually performed, and the symbol \"+\" is an abstract symbol of conjunction which is not necessarily interpreted as corresponding to addition. In this setting, the sequence of coefficients itself is of interest, rather than the convergence of the series. Formal power series are used in combinatorics to describe and study sequences that are otherwise difficult to handle, for example using the method of generating functions. The Hilbert–Poincaré series is a formal power series used to study graded algebras.\n\nEven if the limit of the power series is not considered, if the terms support appropriate structure then it is possible to define operations such as addition, multiplication, derivative, antiderivative for power series \"formally\", treating the symbol \"+\" as if it corresponded to addition. In the most common setting, the terms come from a commutative ring, so that the formal power series can be added term-by-term and multiplied via the Cauchy product. In this case the algebra of formal power series is the total algebra of the monoid of natural numbers over the underlying term ring. If the underlying term ring is a differential algebra, then the algebra of formal power series is also a differential algebra, with differentiation performed term-by-term.\n\nLaurent series generalize power series by admitting terms into the series with negative as well as positive exponents. A Laurent series is thus any series of the form\nIf such a series converges, then in general it does so in an annulus rather than a disc, and possibly some boundary points. The series converges uniformly on compact subsets of the interior of the annulus of convergence.\n\nA Dirichlet series is one of the form\n\nwhere \"s\" is a complex number. For example, if all \"a\" are equal to 1, then the Dirichlet series is the Riemann zeta function\n\nLike the zeta function, Dirichlet series in general play an important role in analytic number theory. Generally a Dirichlet series converges if the real part of \"s\" is greater than a number called the abscissa of convergence. In many cases, a Dirichlet series can be extended to an analytic function outside the domain of convergence by analytic continuation. For example, the Dirichlet series for the zeta function converges absolutely when Re \"s\" > 1, but the zeta function can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on formula_69  with a simple pole at 1.\n\nThis series can be directly generalized to general Dirichlet series.\n\nA series of functions in which the terms are trigonometric functions is called a trigonometric series:\nThe most important example of a trigonometric series is the Fourier series of a function.\n\nGreek mathematician Archimedes produced the first known summation of an infinite series with a\nmethod that is still used in the area of calculus today. He used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of π.\n\nMathematicians from Kerala, India studied infinite series around 1350 CE.\n\nIn the 17th century, James Gregory worked in the new decimal system on infinite series and published several Maclaurin series. In 1715, a general method for constructing the Taylor series for all functions for which they exist was provided by Brook Taylor. Leonhard Euler in the 18th century, developed the theory of hypergeometric series and q-series.\n\nThe investigation of the validity of infinite series is considered to begin with Gauss in the 19th century. Euler had already considered the hypergeometric series\n\non which Gauss published a memoir in 1812. It established simpler criteria of convergence, and the questions of remainders and the range of convergence.\n\nCauchy (1821) insisted on strict tests of convergence; he showed that if two series are convergent their product is not necessarily so, and with him begins the discovery of effective criteria. The terms \"convergence\" and \"divergence\" had been introduced long before by Gregory (1668). Leonhard Euler and Gauss had given various criteria, and Colin Maclaurin had anticipated some of Cauchy's discoveries. Cauchy advanced the theory of power series by his expansion of a complex function in such a form.\n\nAbel (1826) in his memoir on the binomial series\n\ncorrected certain of Cauchy's conclusions, and gave a completely\nscientific summation of the series for complex values of formula_73 and formula_74. He showed the necessity of considering the subject of continuity in questions of convergence.\n\nCauchy's methods led to special rather than general criteria, and\nthe same may be said of Raabe (1832), who made the first elaborate\ninvestigation of the subject, of De Morgan (from 1842), whose\nlogarithmic test DuBois-Reymond (1873) and Pringsheim (1889) have\nshown to fail within a certain region; of Bertrand (1842), Bonnet\n(1843), Malmsten (1846, 1847, the latter without integration);\nStokes (1847), Paucker (1852), Chebyshev (1852), and Arndt\n(1853).\n\nGeneral criteria began with Kummer (1835), and have been\nstudied by Eisenstein (1847), Weierstrass in his various\ncontributions to the theory of functions, Dini (1867),\nDuBois-Reymond (1873), and many others. Pringsheim's memoirs (1889) present the most complete general theory.\n\nThe theory of uniform convergence was treated by Cauchy (1821), his\nlimitations being pointed out by Abel, but the first to attack it\nsuccessfully were Seidel and Stokes (1847–48). Cauchy took up the\nproblem again (1853), acknowledging Abel's criticism, and reaching\nthe same conclusions which Stokes had already found. Thomae used the\ndoctrine (1866), but there was great delay in recognizing the\nimportance of distinguishing between uniform and non-uniform\nconvergence, in spite of the demands of the theory of functions.\n\nA series is said to be semi-convergent (or conditionally convergent) if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent.\n\nSemi-convergent series were studied by Poisson (1823), who also gave a general form for the remainder of the Maclaurin formula. The most important solution of the problem is due, however, to Jacobi (1834),\nwho attacked the question of the remainder from a different standpoint and reached a different formula. This expression was also worked out, and another one given, by Malmsten (1847). Schlömilch (\"Zeitschrift\", Vol.I, p. 192, 1856) also improved Jacobi's remainder, and showed the relation between the remainder and Bernoulli's function\n\nGenocchi (1852) has further contributed to the theory.\n\nAmong the early writers was Wronski, whose \"loi suprême\" (1815) was hardly recognized until Cayley (1873) brought it into\nprominence.\n\nFourier series were being investigated\nas the result of physical considerations at the same time that\nGauss, Abel, and Cauchy were working out the theory of infinite\nseries. Series for the expansion of sines and cosines, of multiple\narcs in powers of the sine and cosine of the arc had been treated by\nJacob Bernoulli (1702) and his brother Johann Bernoulli (1701) and still\nearlier by Vieta. Euler and Lagrange simplified the subject,\nas did Poinsot, Schröter, Glaisher, and Kummer.\n\nFourier (1807) set for himself a different problem, to\nexpand a given function of \"x\" in terms of the sines or cosines of\nmultiples of \"x\", a problem which he embodied in his \"Théorie analytique de la chaleur\" (1822). Euler had already given the\nformulas for determining the coefficients in the series;\nFourier was the first to assert and attempt to prove the general\ntheorem. Poisson (1820–23) also attacked the problem from a\ndifferent standpoint. Fourier did not, however, settle the question\nof convergence of his series, a matter left for Cauchy (1826) to\nattempt and for Dirichlet (1829) to handle in a thoroughly\nscientific manner (see convergence of Fourier series). Dirichlet's treatment (\"Crelle\", 1829), of trigonometric series was the subject of criticism and improvement by\nRiemann (1854), Heine, Lipschitz, Schläfli, and\ndu Bois-Reymond. Among other prominent contributors to the theory of\ntrigonometric and Fourier series were Dini, Hermite, Halphen,\nKrause, Byerly and Appell.\n\nAsymptotic series, otherwise asymptotic expansions, are infinite series whose partial sums become good approximations in the limit of some point of the domain. In general they do not converge. But they are useful as sequences of approximations, each of which provides a value close to the desired answer for a finite number of terms. The difference is that an asymptotic series cannot be made to produce an answer as exact as desired, the way that convergent series can. In fact, after a certain number of terms, a typical asymptotic series reaches its best approximation; if more terms are included, most such series will produce worse answers.\n\nUnder many circumstances, it is desirable to assign a limit to a series which fails to converge in the usual sense. A summability method is such an assignment of a limit to a subset of the set of divergent series which properly extends the classical notion of convergence. Summability methods include Cesàro summation, (\"C\",\"k\") summation, Abel summation, and Borel summation, in increasing order of generality (and hence applicable to increasingly divergent series).\n\nA variety of general results concerning possible summability methods are known. The Silverman–Toeplitz theorem characterizes \"matrix summability methods\", which are methods for summing a divergent series by applying an infinite matrix to the vector of coefficients. The most general method for summing a divergent series is non-constructive, and concerns Banach limits.\n\nThe notion of series can be easily extended to the case of a Banach space. If \"x\" is a sequence of elements of a Banach space \"X\", then the series Σ\"x\" converges to \"x\" ∈ \"X\" if the sequence of partial sums of the series tends to \"x\"; to wit,\nas \"N\" → ∞.\n\nMore generally, convergence of series can be defined in any abelian Hausdorff topological group. Specifically, in this case, Σ\"x\" converges to \"x\" if the sequence of partial sums converges to \"x\".\n\nDefinitions may be given for sums over an arbitrary index set . There are two main differences with the usual notion of series: first, there is no specific order given on the set ; second, this set may be uncountable. The notion of convergence needs to be strengthened, because the concept of conditional convergence depends on the ordering of the index set.\n\nIf formula_77 is a function from an index set to a set , then the \"series\" associated to formula_78 is the formal sum of the elements formula_79 over the index elements formula_80 denoted by the\n\nWhen the index set is the natural numbers formula_82, the function formula_83 is a sequence denoted by formula_84. A series indexed on the natural numbers is an ordered formal sum and so we rewrite formula_85 as formula_86 in order to emphasize the ordering induced by the natural numbers. Thus, we obtain the common notation for a series indexed by the natural numbers\n\nWhen summing a family {\"a\"}, \"i\" ∈ \"I\", of non-negative numbers, one may define\n\nWhen the supremum is finite, the set of \"i\" ∈ \"I\" such that \"a\" > 0 is countable. Indeed, for every \"n\" ≥ 1, the set formula_89 is finite, because\n\nIf \"I\"  is countably infinite and enumerated as \"I\" = {\"i\", \"i\"...} then the above defined sum satisfies\n\nprovided the value ∞ is allowed for the sum of the series.\n\nAny sum over non-negative reals can be understood as the integral of a non-negative function with respect to the counting measure, which accounts for the many similarities between the two constructions.\n\nLet \"a\" : \"I\" → \"X\", where \"I\"  is any set and \"X\"  is an abelian Hausdorff topological group. Let \"F\"  be the collection of all finite subsets of \"I\". Note that \"F\"  is a directed set ordered under inclusion with union as join. Define the sum \"S\"  of the family \"a\" as the limit\n\nif it exists and say that the family \"a\" is unconditionally summable. Saying that the sum \"S\"  is the limit of finite partial sums means that for every neighborhood \"V\"  of 0 in \"X\", there is a finite subset \"A\" of \"I\"  such that\n\nBecause \"F\"  is not totally ordered, this is not a limit of a sequence of partial sums, but rather of a net.\n\nFor every \"W\", neighborhood of 0 in \"X\", there is a smaller neighborhood \"V\"  such that \"V\" − \"V\" ⊂ \"W\". It follows that the finite partial sums of an unconditionally summable family \"a\", \"i\" ∈ \"I\", form a \"Cauchy net\", that is: for every \"W\", neighborhood of 0 in \"X\", there is a finite subset \"A\" of \"I\"  such that\n\nWhen \"X\"  is complete, a family \"a\" is unconditionally summable in \"X\"  if and only if the finite sums satisfy the latter Cauchy net condition. When \"X\"  is complete and \"a\", \"i\" ∈ \"I\", is unconditionally summable in \"X\", then for every subset \"J\" ⊂ \"I\", the corresponding subfamily \"a\", \"j\" ∈ \"J\", is also unconditionally summable in \"X\".\n\nWhen the sum of a family of non-negative numbers, in the extended sense defined before, is finite, then it coincides with the sum in the topological group \"X\" = R.\n\nIf a family \"a\" in \"X\"  is unconditionally summable, then for every \"W\", neighborhood of 0 in \"X\", there is a finite subset \"A\" of \"I\"  such that \"a\" ∈ \"W\"  for every \"i\" not in \"A\". If \"X\"  is first-countable, it follows that the set of \"i\" ∈ \"I\"  such that \"a\" ≠ 0 is countable. This need not be true in a general abelian topological group (see examples below).\n\nSuppose that \"I\" = N. If a family \"a\", \"n\" ∈ N, is unconditionally summable in an abelian Hausdorff topological group \"X\", then the series in the usual sense converges and has the same sum,\n\nBy nature, the definition of unconditional summability is insensitive to the order of the summation. When ∑\"a\" is unconditionally summable, then the series remains convergent after any permutation \"σ\" of the set N of indices, with the same sum,\n\nConversely, if every permutation of a series ∑\"a\" converges, then the series is unconditionally convergent. When \"X\"  is complete, then unconditional convergence is also equivalent to the fact that all subseries are convergent; if \"X\"  is a Banach space, this is equivalent to say that for every sequence of signs \"ε\" = ±1, the series\n\nconverges in \"X\". If \"X\"  is a Banach space, then one may define the notion of absolute convergence. A series ∑\"a\" of vectors in \"X\"  converges absolutely if\n\nIf a series of vectors in a Banach space converges absolutely then it converges unconditionally, but the converse only holds in finite-dimensional Banach spaces (theorem of ).\n\nConditionally convergent series can be considered if \"I\" is a well-ordered set, for example an ordinal number \"α\". One may define by transfinite recursion:\n\nand for a limit ordinal \"α\",\n\nif this limit exists. If all limits exist up to \"α\", then the series converges.\n\n\n"}

Fatal strangling typically occurs in cases of violence, accidents, and is one of two main ways that hanging causes death (alongside breaking the victim's neck).\n\nStrangling does not have to be fatal; limited or interrupted strangling is practised in erotic asphyxia, in the choking game, and is an important technique in many combat sports and self-defence systems. \nStrangling can be divided into three general types according to the mechanism used:\n\nStrangling involves one or several mechanisms that interfere with the normal flow of oxygen into the brain:\nDepending on the particular method of strangulation, one or several of these typically occur in combination; vascular obstruction is usually the main mechanism. Complete obstruction of blood flow to the brain is associated with irreversible neurological damage and death, but during strangulation there is still unimpeded blood flow in the vertebral arteries. Estimates have been made that significant occlusion of the carotid arteries and jugular veins occurs with a pressure of around , while the trachea demands six times more at approximately .\n\nAs in all cases of strangulation, the rapidity of death can be affected by the susceptibility to carotid sinus stimulation. Carotid sinus reflex death is sometimes considered a mechanism of death in cases of strangulation, but it remains highly disputed. The reported time from application to unconsciousness varies from 7–14 seconds if effectively applied to one minute in other cases, with death occurring minutes after unconsciousness.\n\nManual strangulation (also known as \"throttling\") is strangling with the hands, fingers, or other extremities and sometimes also with blunt objects, such as batons. Depending on how the strangling is performed, it may compress the airway, interfere with the flow of blood in the neck, or work as a combination of the two. Consequently, manual strangulation may damage the larynx, and fracture the hyoid or other bones in the neck. In cases of airway compression, manual strangling leads to the frightening sensation of air hunger and may induce violent struggling.\n\nMore technical variants of manual strangulation are referred to as chokeholds, and are extensively practised and used in various martial arts, combat sports, self-defense systems, and in military hand-to-hand combat application. In some martial arts like judo and jujutsu, strangles or chokes that constrict blood flow are regarded as a safe way to render the opponent unconscious as opposed to other attacks, e.g., strikes to the head.\nDuring the 18th century, a sentence of \"Death by Throttling\" would be passed upon the verdict of a Court Martial for the crime of desertion from the British Army.\n\nLigature strangulation (also known as \"garroting\") is strangling with some form of cord such as rope, wire, or shoe laces, either partially or fully circumferencing the neck. Even though the mechanism of strangulation is similar, it is usually distinguished from hanging by the strangling force being something other than the person's own bodyweight. Incomplete occlusion of the carotid arteries is expected and, in cases of homicide, the victim may struggle for a period of time, with unconsciousness typically occurring in 10 to 15 seconds. Cases of ligature strangulation generally involve homicides of women, children, and the elderly, but accidents and suicides occur as well.\n\nCompared to hanging, the ligature mark will most likely be located lower on the neck of the victim.\n\nDuring the Spanish Inquisition, victims who admitted their alleged sins and recanted were killed via ligature strangulation (i.e. the garrote) before their bodies were burnt during the \"auto-da-fé\". Throughout much of the 20th and 21st centuries, the American Mafia used ligature strangulation as a means of murdering their victims.

It is often thrown from behind—such as in the 'knockout game'—although striking from behind is not a prerequisite for a sucker punch. The term is generally used in situations where the way in which the punch has been delivered is considered unfair or unethical, and is done using deception or distraction, hence the term 'sucker' used to refer to the victim. \n\nIn boxing, a sucker punch—as is done when 'hitting on the break', for example—is illegal. For example, when James Butler knocked Richard Grant unconscious after losing a fight to him on points, his license was suspended.\n\nDuring 2013 and 2014, significant media attention was paid to two violent killings involving one-hit punches in Australia. Noting that 91 people had died in Australia in the previous four years from brain trauma as a result of being king hit, a media campaign was launched to refer to them as coward punches. This campaign was supported by the New South Wales Government.\n\nAs of 2017, the \"one hit punch\" and \"king hit\" is still a controversial subject among various minorities within Australia. Each share different views on the actual punch, the circumstances around it or what led to it, the people involved and the outcome of it. Australia has been a leader in criminalizing this kind of attack. \n\nThe term \"sucker punch\" was widely discussed after the New York Jets' starting quarterback, Geno Smith, was \"sucker punched\" by a fellow player, IK Enemkpali, on August 11, 2015. The altercation was in the locker room about compensation regarding a $600 airplane ticket.\n\nThe sucker punch has been adapted into many films, video games and other forms of media. It can be used to show the antagonist's vileness, the low morals of an anti-hero, betrayal of someone close to the protagonist, etc. However, it also can be used as a weapon of the protagonist to deal with an unfair situation. A sucker punch is a major dramatic element in the 2004 film \"Million Dollar Baby\". \n\nThere are also several videos depicting sucker punches on video-sharing websites such as YouTube, however YouTube forbids such content as a violation of its Community Guidelines and are thus not supposed to be on there.\n\nAustralian soap operas \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" have covered the topic in storylines broadcast in September 2014 and October 2015 respectively.\n\nIn the Pokémon game series, a move has the English name of . It is a Dark-type move that allows the user to attack before the other Pokémon has a chance to, provided that the targeted Pokémon is going to attack in that same turn.\n\nP. J. O'Rourke has referred to a combination of grain alcohol and Gatorade as \"sucker punch.\"\n\nSucker punches tend to be done after employing distraction tactics such as pretending to notice something to trick the victim into looking also, having an accomplice to distract the victim, looking away to get the victim's guard down, or pretending to walk away only to turn around and deliver the strike. As sucker punches rely on deception they can often be anticipated using methods such as: \nSucker punches are commonly performed using either a hook-type punch, or a haymaker-type punch, as these are more damaging than straight shots due to the increased distance traveled thus enabling more time for acceleration.\n\nBecause sucker punches come unexpectedly, people at risk of such blows must be alert to the proximity of potential opponents.\n"}
{"id": "316424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316424", "title": "Three Kingdoms of Korea", "text": "Three Kingdoms of Korea\n\nThe concept of the Three Kingdoms of Korea () refers to the three kingdoms of Baekje (백제), Silla (신라) and Goguryeo (고구려). Goguryeo was later known as Goryeo (고려), from which the modern name \"Korea\" is derived. The Three Kingdoms period was defined as being from 57 BC to 668 AD (but there existed about 78 tribal states in the southern region of Korean peninsula and relatively big states like Okjeo, Buyeo, and Dongye in its northern part and Manchuria).\n\nThe three kingdoms occupied the entire Korean Peninsula and most of Manchuria, located in present-day China and Russia. The kingdoms of Baekje and Silla dominated the southern half of the Korean Peninsula and Tamna, whereas Goguryeo controlled the Liaodong Peninsula, Manchuria and the northern half of the Korean Peninsula. Baekje and Goguryeo shared founding myths and originated from Buyeo.\n\nIn the 7th century, allied with China under the Tang dynasty, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula for the first time in Korean history, forming a united Korean national identity for the first time. After the fall of Baekje and Goguryeo, the Tang dynasty established a short-lived military government to administer parts of the Korean peninsula. However, as a result of the Silla–Tang Wars (≈670–676), Silla forces expelled the Protectorate armies from the peninsula in 676. The following period is known as the Unified Silla or Later Silla (668–935).\n\nSubsequently, Dae Joyeong, a former Goguryeo general, founded Balhae in the former territory of Goguryeo after defeating the Tang dynasty at the Battle of Tianmenling.\n\nThe predecessor period, before the development of the full-fledged kingdoms, is sometimes called Proto–Three Kingdoms period.\n\nMain primary sources for this period include \"Samguk Sagi\" and \"Samguk Yusa\" in Korea, and the \"Eastern Barbarians\" section (東夷傳) from the \"Book of Wei\" (魏書) of the \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\" in China.\n\nBeginning in the 7th century, the name \"Samhan\" became synonymous with the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The \"Han\" in the names of the Korean Empire, \"Daehan Jeguk\", and the Republic of Korea (South Korea), \"Daehan Minguk\" or \"Hanguk\", are named in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea.\n\nAccording to the Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa, Silla implemented a national policy, \"Samhan Unification\" (), to integrate refugees and migrants from Baekje and Goguryeo. In 1982, a memorial stone dating back to 686 was discovered in Cheongju with an inscription: \"The Three Han were unified and the domain was expanded.\" During the Later Silla period, the concepts of Samhan as the ancient confederacies and the Three Kingdoms of Korea were merged. In a letter to an imperial tutor of the Tang dynasty, Choe Chiwon equated Byeonhan to Baekje, Jinhan to Silla, and Mahan to Goguryeo. By the Goryeo period, Samhan became a common name to refer to all of Korea. In his Ten Mandates to his descendants, Wang Geon declared that he had unified the Three Han (Samhan), referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Samhan continued to be a common name for Korea during the Joseon period and was widely referenced in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty.\n\nIn China, the Three Kingdoms of Korea were collectively called Samhan since the beginning of the 7th century. The use of the name Samhan to indicate the Three Kingdoms of Korea was widespread in the Tang dynasty. Goguryeo was alternately called Mahan by the Tang dynasty, as evidenced by a Tang document that called Goguryeo generals \"Mahan leaders\" () in 645. In 651, Emperor Gaozong of Tang sent a message to the king of Baekje referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea as Samhan. Epitaphs of the Tang dynasty, including those belonging to Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla refugees and migrants, called the Three Kingdoms of Korea \"Samhan\", especially Goguryeo. For example, the epitaph of Go Hyeon (), a Tang dynasty general of Goguryeo origin who died in 690, calls him a \"Liaodong Samhan man\" (). The History of Liao equates Byeonhan to Silla, Jinhan to Buyeo, and Mahan to Goguryeo.\n\nThe name \"Three Kingdoms\" was used in the titles of the Korean histories \"Samguk Sagi\" (12th century) and \"Samguk Yusa\" (13th century), and should not be confused with the Chinese Three Kingdoms.\n\nThe Three Kingdoms was founded after the fall of Wiman Joseon, and gradually conquered and absorbed various other small states and confederacies. After the fall of Gojoseon, the Han dynasty established four commanderies in present\nLiaoning. Three fell quickly to the Samhan, and the last was destroyed by Goguryeo in 313.\n\nThe nascent precursors of Baekje and Silla expanded within the web of statelets during the Proto Three Kingdoms Period, and Goguryeo conquered neighboring state like Buyeo in Manchuria and chiefdoms in Okjeo, Dongye which occupied the northeastern Korean peninsula. The three polities made the transition from walled-town state to full-fledged state-level societies between 1st – 3rd century AD.\n\nAll three kingdoms shared a similar culture and language. Their original religions appear to have been shamanistic, but they were increasingly influenced by Chinese culture, particularly Confucianism and Taoism. In the 4th century, Buddhism was introduced to the peninsula and spread rapidly, briefly becoming the official religion of all three kingdoms.\n\nGoguryeo emerged on the north and south banks of the Yalu (Amrok) River, in the wake of Gojoseon's fall. The first mention of Goguryeo in Chinese records dates from 75 BC in reference to a commandery established by the Chinese Han dynasty, although even earlier mentions of \"Guri\" (구리) may be of the same state. Evidence indicates Goguryeo was the most advanced, and likely the first established, of the three kingdoms.\n\nGoguryeo, eventually the largest of the three kingdoms, had several capitals in alternation: two capitals in the upper Yalu area, and later Nangrang (\"Lelang\" in Chinese) which is now part of Pyongyang. At the beginning, the state was located on the border with China; it gradually expanded into Manchuria and destroyed the Chinese Lelang commandery in 313. The cultural influence of the Chinese continued as Buddhism was adopted as the official religion in 372.\n\nGoguryeo was a highly militaristic state; it was a powerful empire and one of the great powers in East Asia. The state was at its zenith in the fifth century, during the rule of King Gwanggaeto the Great and his son King Jangsu, and particularly during their campaign against China in Manchuria. For the next century or so, Goguryeo was the dominant nation in Chinese Manchuria and the Korean peninsula. Goguryeo eventually occupied the Liaodong Plains in Manchuria and today's Seoul area. Gwanggaeto achieved a loose unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.\n\nGoguryeo controlled not only Koreans but also Chinese and Tungusic tribes in Manchuria and North Korea. After the establishment of the Sui Dynasty and later the Tang Dynasty in China, the estate continued to aggress China and Korean Silla and Baekje until conquered by allied Silla–Tang forces in 668. Most of its territory was absorbed by Tang Dynasty China and the territory of former Baekje was absorbed by Korean Silla.\n\nBaekje was founded as a member of the Mahan confederacy. Two sons of the founder of Goguryeo are recorded to have fled a succession conflict, to establish Baekje around the present Seoul area.\n\nBaekje absorbed or conquered other Mahan chiefdoms and, at its peak in the 4th century, controlled most of the western Korean peninsula. Buddhism was introduced to Baekje in 384 from Goguryeo, which Baekje welcomed.\n\nBaekje was a great maritime power; its nautical skill, which made it the Phoenicia of East Asia, was instrumental in the dissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia and continental culture to Japan. Baekje played a fundamental role in transmitting cultural and material developments to ancient Japan, including Chinese written characters, Chinese and Korean literature, technologies such as ferrous metallurgy and ceramics, architectural styles, sericulture and Buddhism.\n\nBaekje exerted its political influence on Tamna, a kingdom that ruled Jejudo. Baekje maintained a close relationship with and extracted tribute from Tamna. Baekje's religious and artistic culture influenced Goguryeo and Silla.\n\nBaekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, especially during the time of Geunchogo, but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto and declined.\n\nIn the late 5th century, under attack from Goguryeo, the capital of Baekje was moved south to Ungjin (present-day Gongju) and later further south to Sabi (present-day Buyeo).\n\nAccording to Korean records, in 57 BC, Seorabeol (or Saro, later Silla) in the southeast of the peninsula unified and expanded the confederation of city-states known as Jinhan. Although \"Samguk Sagi\" records that Silla was the earliest-founded of the three kingdoms, other written and archaeological records indicate that Silla was likely the last of the three to establish a centralized government.\n\nSilla was the smallest and weakest of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually Tang China, to its great advantage.\n\nRenamed from Saro to Silla in 503, the kingdom annexed the Gaya confederacy (which in turn had absorbed Byeonhan earlier) in the first half of the 6th century. Goguryeo and Baekje responded by forming an alliance. To cope with invasions from Goguryeo and Baekje, Silla deepened its relations with the Tang Dynasty, with her newly gained access to the Yellow Sea making direct contact with the Tang possible. After the conquest of Goguryeo and Baekje with her Tang allies, the Silla kingdom drove the Tang forces out of the peninsula and occupied the lands south of Pyongyang.\n\nThe capital of Silla was Seorabeol (now Gyeongju; \"Seorabeol\", \"서라벌\", is hypothesized to have been the ancient Korean term for \"capital\"). Buddhism became the official religion in 528. The remaining material culture from the kingdom of Silla including unique gold metalwork shows influence from the northern nomadic steppes, differentiating it from the culture of Goguryeo and Baekje where Chinese influence was more pronounced.\n\nOther smaller states or regions existed in Korea before and during this period:\nAllied with China under the Tang dynasty, Silla conquered Goguryeo in 668, after having already conquered Gaya in 562 and Baekje in 660, thus ushering in the North-South states period with Later Silla to the south and Balhae to the north, when Dae Jo-young, a former Goguryeo military officer, revolted against Tang Chinese rule and began reconquering former Goguryeo territories.\n\nArchaeologists use theoretical guidelines derived from anthropology, ethnology, analogy, and ethnohistory to the concept of what defines a state-level society. This is different from the concept of state (\"guk\" or Sino ko: 國, walled-town state, etc.) in the discipline of Korean History. In anthropological archaeology the presence of urban centres (especially capitals), monumental architecture, craft specialization and standardization of production, ostentatious burials, writing or recording systems, bureaucracy, demonstrated political control of geographical areas that are usually larger in area than a single river valley, etc. make up some of these correlates that define states.\nAmong the archaeology sites dating to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, hundreds of cemeteries with thousands of burials have been excavated. The vast majority of archaeological evidence of the Three Kingdoms Period of Korea consists of burials, but since the 1990s there has been a great increase in the archaeological excavations of ancient industrial production sites, roads, palace grounds and elite precincts, ceremonial sites, commoner households, and fortresses due to the boom in salvage archaeology in South Korea.\n\nRhee and Choi hypothesize that a mix of internal developments and external factors lead to the emergence of state-level societies in Korea. A number of archaeologists including Kang demonstrate the role of frequent warfare in the development of peninsular states.\n\nSome individual correlates of complex societies are found in the chiefdoms of Korea that date back to c. 700 BC (e.g. see Igeum-dong, Songguk-ri). However, the best evidence from the archaeological record in Korea indicates that states formed between 300 BC and 300/400 AD. However, archaeologists are not prepared to suggest that this means there were states in the BC era. The correlates of state-level societies did not develop as a package, but rather in spurts and starts and at various points in time. It was some time between 100–400 AD that individual correlates of state societies had developed to a sufficient number and scale that state-level societies can be confidently identified using archaeological data.\n\nLee Sung-joo analyzed variability in many of the elite cemeteries of the territories of Silla and Gaya polities and found that as late as the 2nd century there was intra-cemetery variation in the distribution of prestige grave goods, but there was an absence of hierarchical differences on a regional scale between cemeteries. Near the end of the 2nd century AD, interior space in elite burials increased in size, and wooden chamber burial construction techniques were increasingly used by elites. In the 3rd century, a pattern developed in which single elite cemeteries that were the highest in status compared to all the other cemeteries were built. Such cemeteries were established at high elevations along ridgelines and on hilltops. Furthermore, the uppermost elite were buried in large-scale tombs established at the highest point of a given cemetery. Cemeteries with 'uppermost elite' mounded burials such as Okseong-ri, Yangdong-ri, Daeseong-dong, and Bokcheon-dong display this pattern.\n\nLee Sung-joo proposed that, in addition to the development of regional political hierarchies as seen through analysis of burials, variation in types of pottery production gradually disappeared and full-time specialization was the only recognizable kind of pottery production from the end of the 4th century A.D. At the same time the production centers for pottery became highly centralized and vessels became standardized.\n\nCentralisation and elite control of production is demonstrated by the results of the archaeological excavations at Songok-dong and Mulcheon-ni in Gyeongju. These sites are part of what was an interconnected and sprawling ancient industrial complex on the northeast outskirts of the Silla capital. Songok-dong and Mulcheon-ri are an example of the large-scale of specialized factory-style production in the Three Kingdoms and Unified Silla Periods. The site was excavated in the late 1990s, and archaeologists found the remains of many production features such as pottery kilns, roof-tile kilns, charcoal kilns, as well as the remains of buildings and workshops associated with production.\n\nSince the establishment of Goguryeo, its early history is well attested archaeologically: The first and second capital cities, Jolbon and Gungnae city, located in and around today's Ji'an, Jilin. In 2004, the site was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Since 1976, continuing archaeological excavations concentrated in the southeastern part of modern Gyeongju have revealed parts of the so-called \"Silla Wanggyeong\" (Silla royal capital). A number of excavations over the years have revealed temples such as Hwangnyongsa, Bunhwangsa, Heungryunsa, and 30 other sites. Signs of Baekje's capitals have also been excavated at the Mongchon Fortress and the Pungnap Fortress in Seoul.\n\n\n\n"}

The word literally means \"patches\", in reference to the pieces of material sewn together. The tivaevae are either made by one woman or can be created in groups of women called \"vainetini\". The \"vainetini\" use this time together to bond, sing and catch up on village news.\n\nTivaevae are often given on very special occasions either to important visitors, as birthday and wedding gifts or used to cover the body of a loved one who has died. They are often displayed during important events like the traditional boys' hair-cutting ceremonies, birthdays and weddings.\n\nBy custom, a tivaevae is not measured by monetary value nor production cost. Its value is said to be reflected by the love and patience that the creator(s) have put into making a stunning work of art. Cook Islands women often described their tivaevae as being \"something from the heart\".\n\nTivaevae are rarely seen for sale on the islands. The Atiu Fibre Arts Studio on Atiu is the only place in the Cook Islands where they are commercially produced and available for purchase.\n\nThe tivaevae's origins are uncertain. Rongokea (1992) believes it to be an imported art form, and cites two sets of Christian missionaries in the 19th century as possible origins. While it is known that these female missionaries taught the indigenous women how to sew, it is not certain that they taught them the craft of quilting or making bed coverlets. The appliqué style of tivaevae quilting appears to have been influence by Pennsylvanian German scherenschnitte or Victorian folded paper-cutting traditions. Multiple origins and influences thus seem likely.\n\nAs an art form, tivaevae replaced barkcloth production in Tahiti and the Cook Islands by the late 19th century: the function and nature of barkcloth production was transferred to tivaevae.\n\n\n"}
