{"id": "12753408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12753408", "title": "Adventure park", "text": "Adventure park\n\nAn adventure park is a place which can contain a wide variety of elements, such as rope climbing exercises, obstacle courses and zip-lines. They are usually intended for recreation.\n\n\"Recreational-oriented\" adventure parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors. They do not follow a specific educational concept, but see the individual, physical and mental challenge as a predominantly recreational activity. Neither climbing techniques nor special/specific physical fitness experience are necessary. Typical slogans are: \"Have Fun, Test your Courage, Overcome your Own Fears, Be Outside, Be in the Nature, Do some Physical Activities, etc.\"\n\nIt is unclear where and when the first ropes course was created. A ropes course was built in 1875 in France and functioned mainly as a physical challenge activity for the participants. During the Second World War, ropes courses were used as obstacle courses for improving the physical fitness of the British military.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, ropes courses became a central component of outdoor seminars in the United States.\n\nIn recent years, specifically recreation-oriented Adventure Parks were developed. The market has boomed especially in Europe & Asian countries.\n\nAs already mentioned, a ropes course is often a challenging outdoor personal development and team-building activity with a relatively low number of participants. Some parks offer both - a recreational section and a team building section.\n\nA canopy tour is a specific type of ziplining where a person is harnessed to a steel cable and propelled by gravity from platform to platform high up in the trees of a thick forest canopy. Although these date back far into history for civil and even scientific uses, they are now used for recreation and have created a new activity for the tourism industry.\n\nThe category Adventure Parks can be broken down into a huge variety of specific types. They differ according to the following main criteria:\n\nForest Adventure Parks are very popular. They take advantage of the beauty of a forest, of the trees (no investment in poles) and offer an outdoor activity surrounded by nature. They offer not only an adventure “at height” in a forest, but also the benefit for customers of experiencing the spectacular natural beauty of trees, hills, cliffs and/or rivers. In forest parks, there is a particular focus on tree-friendly installation. In most cases, the platforms are held to the trees through the principle of friction. When the exercise elements are mounted, the trees are protected by coats of wood or rubber to prevent rubbing from the ropes.\n\nDepending on how they are used and where they are located, parks on poles are an excellent alternative. They offer complete freedom in terms of park design and location but, at the same time, require higher investment (in the poles). The heat of the summer can be a challenge. A mix of poles/trees at the edge of a forest has the potential to work well.\nIndoor parks have the great advantage of being an “all year round” operation but with the corresponding weakness of that strength at times when fine weather encourages outdoor activities. These trails are often built on a modular metallic structure. New parks on wood poles have shown that an indoor park can also provide a good experience.\n\nAdventure Parks can be found in a multitude of places/locations. Examples of trends:\n\nLarge Adventure Parks usually have several trails of increasing difficulty levels and can reach up to 10 trails. With 10 to 20 acrobatic elements per trail, the park can easily reach up to 200 elements (it is usually between 40 and 200 elements).\n\nThe majority of trails are for everyone from the age of 7 years old (sometimes 10). The difficulty level starts at a low level or “green trail” and progresses to a very challenging level or “black trail”. Specific trails for kids from 4 years are very popular with families and provide a boost to the business (up to 20-30% more clients). Sometimes there are specific trails for the disabled.\n\nMost kids love Adventure Parks. In a park they can act independently, try and fail and try again, and overcome their own fears without any risk (a continuous belay system is strongly recommended). Thanks the variety of levels, each time they can push their own boundaries and reach their own challenges. This is a perfect outdoor activity (with individual, physical and mental challenges) to learn through play.\n\nThe acrobatic elements are artificial obstacles (exercises) made from ropes, nets and wood in various forms, and which are installed at different heights in trees. The clever arrangement of such obstacles encourages many basic forms of movement such as climbing, hand over hand, balancing, holding, slipping and sliding. A good mix of elements and zip-lines increases the diversity and interest of parks – People love zip-lines.\n\nThere are two approaches to how to structure a park: (1) the so-called French approach where you move from one trail to the next one, like setting out on a trip and coming back to the start or (2) more the Swiss approach with one common starting point (often a platform) where the visitors can choose anytime which trail they want to go. The latter approach has the great advantage to be self-distributing and therefore allowing higher throughput by peak.\nThere are 2 schools concerning the height of the lifeline:\n\nConcerning the safety, traditionally a self-safety system is used where participants take responsibility for themselves. Before starting, the participants receive special training in how to use the safety equipment and then run the various trails independently. The emergence of new technologies has drastically increased the level of safety and opened new business opportunities.\n\nThe safety equipment for each participant basically consists of a harness, a lanyard and a belay system (another option would simply be a net under the trails – relatively expensive and with limited application). Sometimes helmets are also used.\n\nThere are distinctions between the following main four belay systems:\n\nThe traditional self-belay system basically consists of two carabiners operated by the participants. The participants successively unlock/lock the connection of the carabiners on each platform (zone of risk). Mishandling and removal of both carabiners at the same time will cause complete unlocking. This situation could mean a life-threatening risk and there have been instances of serious accidents and even terminal injuries.\n\nThe permanent belay systems significantly reduce the risk of accident. The two carabiners have a \"communicating system” which avoids simultaneous opening of the carabiners and the complete unlocking from the cable. A permanent system with integrated rollers can even be found.\n\nThe continuous belay systems on rail offer a high level of safety but has limited application – it is mainly on poles with a heavy structure, for relatively short elements and it is expensive (and more common in the USA than in Europe).\n\nWith a continuous belay system on cable, visitors are continuously connected to the lifeline (cable) from the start to the finish without any possibility of becoming unlocked - which provides the highest safety level. At the start of the trail, the visitors simply connect the lifeline into the belay device (hook or trolley) and they can run the whole trail – in term of safety, no specific further action is required. \nFor the continuous belay system with integrated trolley, the belay device simply rolls along the whole lifeline and greatly eases the passage on zip-lines (no handling required). This last technology is the only system allowing the lifeline to be “out of reach” which has numerous advantages (higher throughput, more impressive elements, more convenience, lower risk of injury)\n\nRecreational-oriented Adventure Parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors: In Europe 10,000 to 60,000 or even more participants per season are common (usually April to October) and often with a high variation pattern (high attendance on weekends and during vacations).\n\nThe key challenges are manifold: attractive value proposition, pool of potential clients, safety level & risk management, needs of training & supervision and flexible operation.\n\nIn order to ensure a profitable and sustainable operation, meeting the last three challenges is essential. The new technologies in safety systems bring Adventure Parks into a new era by dramatically reducing the risk of accident (permanent and continuous systems) and reducing the needs of training and supervision (continuous systems).\n\nThe EN 15567-1 and -2 standards regulate the construction and operation of high ropes Courses / Adventure Parks. The various associations as ERCA and IAPA in Europe or ACCT and PRCA in the USA are acting towards professionalization of the industry.\n\n"}
{"id": "5071166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5071166", "title": "Ages of consent in Asia", "text": "Ages of consent in Asia\n\nThe legal age of consent for sexual activity varies by jurisdiction across Asia, from age 12 to 21 years of age. The specific activity engaged in or the gender of its participants can also be affected by the law. Below is a discussion of the various laws dealing with this subject. The highlighted age refers to an age at or above which an individual can engage in unfettered sexual relations with another who is also at or above that age. Other variables, such as homosexual relations or close in age exceptions, may exist, and are noted when relevant, for example in Indonesia.\n\nThe below is a list of all jurisdictions in Asia as listed in List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia.\n\nSexual activity outside marriage is illegal in Afghanistan. The minimum age of marriage is 18 for men and 16 for women. \n\nThe age of consent in Bahrain is 21 regardless of gender or sexual orientation. According to Article 345 [s amended by Legislative Decree n. 7, 1985], The penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding twenty years will be the punishment for anyone who has sex with a woman who is older than 14, but has not yet reached the age of sixteen, with consent. The penalty of imprisonment exceeding 10 years is the sentence for anyone who has sex with a woman who is over sixteen years but less than twenty one years, with consent.\n\nThis age of consent applies to women who marry without the permission of their fathers.\n\nThe Penal Code of Bangladesh considers 14 years as the age of consent.\n\nThe age of consent in Bhutan is 18 regardless of gender or sexual orientation, according to Article 183 of the Penal Code of Bhutan.\n\nThe age of consent in Brunei is 16.\n\nArticle 2 of this Act determines the offence as follows:\nAny person who has or attempts to have carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of sixteen (16) years except by way of marriage, shall be guilty of an offence: Penalty, imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 2 years and not more than 7 years and to whipping not exceeding 24 strokes of the rattan in the case of an adult or 12 strokes of the rattan in the case of a youthful offender.\n\nThe age of consent in Cambodia is 15 regardless of gender or sexual orientation. The age of consent in this country is determined by Article 8, of Chapter 4 (\"Debauchery\") of the \"Law on Suppression of the Kidnapping, Trafficking, and Exploitation of Human Beings\", which has been specifically enacted to prohibit sex with children under 15. The law prohibits \"debauchery\" with a child under 15, and this term (the original Cambodian word is “anacha”) has been interpreted by courts to forbid any form of sexual conduct (both consensual and non-consensual; both 'ordinary' sex and paid sex) with a child under 15. This is the main legal tool used to prosecute foreigners engaging in child sex tourism in Cambodia.\n\nArticle 8 of the 'Law on Suppression of the Kidnapping, Trafficking, and Exploitation of Human Beings' states, \"Any person who commits acts of debauchery involving a minor below 15 years old, even if there is consent from the concerned minor, or even if the person has bought such minor from someone else or from a pimp, shall be punished by ten (10) to twenty (20) years in prison. In case of repeat offenses, the maximum punishment term shall be applied.\"\n\nIn Mainland China, the age of consent for sexual activity is 14 years, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Chinese law defines statutory rape as having sex with a girl who is less than fourteen years of age. A five-year prison sentence and fine may result if the girl under 14 years of age was acting as a prostitute. On August 2015, the law concerning underage prostitutes was repealed. The Statutory rape law now applies to underage prostitution as well.\n\nThe age of consent in East Timor is 14 regardless of gender or sexual orientation, per Article 177. However, sex acts with an adolescent aged 14–15 years are illegal if an adult practices them with the adolescent by \"taking advantage of the inexperience\" of that adolescent. (Article 178).\n\nArticle 177. Sexual abuse of a minor:\n\nArticle 178. Sexual acts with an adolescent:\n\nIn Hong Kong the age of consent for sexual activity is 16 regardless of gender or sexual orientation. However, the age of consent for a female receiving anal sex is 21.\n\nUnder s.124 of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap.200), a man who has unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years. Under s.123 of the Crimes Ordinance, a man who has unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13 shall be liable to imprisonment for life.\n\nUnder s.122 of the Crimes Ordinance, a person under the age of 16 cannot in law give any consent which would prevent an act being an assault for the purposes of indecent assault. Hence, a woman who has sexual activity with a boy or a girl under 16 will be prosecuted under this section.\n\nThe previous position regarding homosexual couples is contained in s.118C which provides that a man who commits or suffers to commit buggery with a man under the age of 21 is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life. However, this section was struck down as unconstitutional in \"Leung TC William Roy v Secretary for Justice\". Hence, the age of consent between two males have been effectively equalized with that between a male and a female, which is 16.\n\nPrior to 2012 there was a presumption that a male minor under 14 could not consent to sexual intercourse under any circumstances. The law was changed after a 13-year-old boy attacked a 5-year-old girl at a Chai Wan hospital ward; the prosecution was unable to convict him of rape, instead only able to do so for indecent assault. In 2015 an 11-year-old boy and a 13-year-old boy were arrested after they were found having sex with an 11-year-old girl. Under the new laws they have the possibility of having the maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nIndia's age of consent for sex is 18 under the \"Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013\".\n\nIn 1892, the marital rape and subsequent death of a 10-year-old girl, Phulmoni Dasi, caused the age of consent to be raised from 10 to 12. In 1949, it was raised to 16 after agitation from women groups about the adverse effect of early pregnancy. In 1982, it was again raised to 16. On 3 April 2014 the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 came into effect which raised the legal permissible age for sexual consent from 16 to 18. Although, the \"Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013\" initially sought to lower the age to 16, it was set at 18 due to political pressure from conservative parties. Section 375 reads: A man is said to commit \"rape\" if he (...) Sixthly — With or without her consent, when she is \"under eighteen years of age\".\n\n Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 disallows any such sexual relationships and puts such crimes within marriages as an aggravated offense. A Public Interest Litigation filled by Independent Thought, an organization working on child rights law, was heard in the Supreme Court of India for declaring the exception allowing marital rape within prohibited child marriages as unconstitutional: \"Independent Thought vs. Union of India [W.P(civil) 382 of 2013]\". In the judgment, delivered on October 11, the Supreme Court bench consisting of Justices Madan B. Lokur and Deepak Gupta read down Exception 2 to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to hold that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife if she is below 18 years of age would amount to rape.\n\nThe Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, an old British-era law, bans \"carnal intercourse against the order of nature\". It was used to prosecute people for having anal or oral sex, although prosecutions are rare. The law was constitutionally challenged at the Delhi High Court in 2009 for violating the human rights of sexual minorities. But, after the Delhi High Court declared some parts of the law unconstitutional on the issue, the age of consent for consensual homosexual sex was set at 18.\n\nAccording to the Indonesian Penal Code article 287, the age of consent in Indonesia is 15 years old. The age of consent is the minimum age at which an individual is considered legally old enough to consent to participation in sexual activity. Individuals aged 14 or younger in Indonesia are not legally able to consent to sexual activity, and such activity may result in prosecution for statutory rape or the equivalent local law.\n\nEven though the age of consent is 15 years old, the offender can only be charged and prosecuted if a legal complaint is lodged to the law enforcement. Exception to this law is when the age of the victim is under 12 years old, or under certain circumstances such as bodily injury or incest.\n\nHowever, under the Child Protection Act, the age of consent could be raised to 18. The argument used is that sexual acts with a child could result in bodily and mental injury, while the definition of a child is anyone who is under 18 years old. A reported court verdict using the Child Protection Act was done in 2009 against an Australian national.\n\nSexuality outside marriage is illegal in Iran. The minimum age of marriage in Iran is 18 for men and 15 for women. Ways around these regulations include temporary marriages (Nikah mut‘ah). With the permission of a court girls may marry at a younger age; during 2010 as many as 42,000 children aged between 10 and 14 were married, and 716 girls younger than 10 had wed.\n\nThe age of consent in Iraq is 18. \"Any person who sexually assaults a boy or girl under the age of 18 without the use of force, menaces or deception is punishable by detention...\"\n\n\"Any person who has sexual intercourse with a female relative to the third generation under the age of 15 with her consent and the offence leads to her death, to pregnancy or loss of virginity [is punishable by death].\"\n\nHowever, the age of consent might change in the future to age nine for females and 15 for males. However, some reporters believe that the draft suggests that there will not be an age of consent.\n\nAccording to the Israeli Penal Code of 1977 the age of consent in Israel is 16 regardless of gender or sexual orientation, for any form of sexual relations involving penetration (unless the person above 16 is the one being penetrated - in that case the age of consent is 14). In all cases that don't involve penetration, the age of consent is 14 (for both heterosexual and homosexual activities ). A special case arises when a person aged 14 or 15 had sexual relations with an older partner; in this case the older partner would be exempt of criminal liability if three conditions are met: the age difference between the partners was less than three years, the younger partner gave consent and the act was done out of \"regular friendly relations\" and without the abuse of power.\n\nIn Japan, the Japanese Penal Code sets a minimal age of consent of 13 regardless of gender or sexual orientation. However, the Children Welfare Act chapter 34 forbids any act of \"fornication\" (淫行) with children (here defined as anyone under 18 years of age) with prefectures and districts specifying further details in (largely similar) \"obscenity ordinances\" () like adding exemptions for sex in the context of a sincere romantic relationship (typically determined by parental approval).\n\nThe age of consent in Jordan is 16 regardless of gender or sexual orientation.\n\nSexual activity outside marriage is illegal in Kuwait. The marriageable age is 15 for girls and 17 for boys.\n\nThe age of consent in Kyrgyzstan is 16.\n\nThe age of consent in Laos is 15 regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Article 129 of the Laos \"Penal Code\" provides for a penalty of 1–5 years' imprisonment and a fine of 2–5 million kip.\n\nAny kind of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal in Lebanon\n\nThe age of consent for sex in Lebanon is 18 for both males and females in regardless of gender or sexual orientation.\n\nArticle 505 of the Penal Code states, \"Whoever commits a sexual act with a minor of less than fifteen (15) years, shall be punished with hard labor of up to fifteen (15) years. This penalty shall be for a minimum of five (5) years, if the victim has not attained the age of twelve (12) years. And whoever commits a sexual act with a minor aged more than fifteen (15) years but less than eighteen (18) years, shall be punished by imprisonment for a period varying between 2 months and 2 years.\"\nThe general age of consent in Macau is 14, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Although people under the age of 18 years are considered minors, the Criminal Code does not criminalize sex with people older than 16 years of age (except in the specific case of minors aged 16 to 18 years old entrusted to an adult for education or assistance purposes whom have abused such position (article 167/1(b) of the Macau Criminal Code)).\n\nSex with minors younger than 14 years old is more severely punished (1 to 8 years' imprisonment) than with minors aged 14 to 16 years old (up to 4 years' imprisonment if the perpetrator abused the minor's inexperience). Anal sex, irrespective of the gender or orientation of the participants (male-male, female-female, male-female), has an aggravated punishment (3 to 10 years of jail if practiced with a minor under the age of 14 and up to 4 years if practiced with an older minor).\n\nThe age of consent for heterosexual sex in Malaysia is 16 for both sexes as homosexual activity in Malaysia is illegal.\n\nMalaysian Penal Code (Act 574), Section 375\n\nSexual activity outside marriage is illegal in Maldives. The legal age of marriage is 18 for both males and females. As Maldivians follow the Islamic Shariah, girls below the age of 18 can get married with parental consent. Done otherwise, it would be a crime. \nEngaging in any type of sexual interaction is illegal before marriage.\n\nThe age of consent in Mongolia is 16, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.\n\nThe 1860 Indian Penal Code was also inherited in Myanmar, making the age of consent 14 there as well.\n\nSection 375.\n\nA man is said to commit \"rape\" who, except in the case hereinafter excepted, has sexual intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any of the five following descriptions:\n\nFirst — Against her will.\n\nSecondly — Without her consent.\n\nThirdly — With her consent, when her consent has been obtained by putting her in fear of death or hurt.\n\nFourthly – With her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband, and that her consent is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully married.\n\n\"Fifthly\" – \"With or without her consent, when she is under fourteen years\".\n\nThe age of consent in Nepal is 18 regardless of gender or sexual orientation.\n\nThe age of consent in North Korea is 15. Article 153 of the criminal law states that a man who has sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 15 shall be \"punished gravely.\"\n\nSexual activity outside marriage is illegal in Oman.\n\nSexual activity outside marriage is illegal in Pakistan. The normal minimum legal age for marriage is 18 for boys and 16 for girls.\n\nIn the Gaza Strip, any kind of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal.\n\nThe age of sexual consent is the same as in Jordanian Article 306 of the Penal Code. Consensual sex is legal at the age of 16 years.\n\nThe minimum age for consensual sex is 18 years. United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices lists the age of consent of Philippines as 18.\nSexual intercourse with a person \"under the age of 18\" is defined as rape, under Chapter 3, Article 266 of the Anti-Rape Law of 1997.\n\nThe statutory rape law criminalizes sex with minors under age 18 and sex with a child under age 18 involving force, threat, or intimidation. The maximum penalty for child rape is 40 years in prison plus a lifetime bar from political office. As of August the PNP reported 2,750 cases of child rape. The production, possession, and distribution of child pornography are illegal, and penalties range from one month to life in prison plus fines from 50,000 to five million pesos ($1,000 to $100,000), depending on the gravity of the offense.\n\nIn regard to children under the age of 18, as described earlier in the act as an individual under the age of 18, the law reads:\n\nAny kind of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal. According to the Family Act, the minimum age of marriage is 18 for boys and 16 for girls. The court may allow a marriage below the minimum age, but it requires the consent of the legal guardian as well as the consent of the two persons to be married.\n\nAny kind of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal in Saudi Arabia. As of 2013, age of consent for marriage was expected to be set to 18, but this was opposed by the grand mufti. In 2013, no restrictions regarding age existed.\n\nThe age of consent in Singapore is 16 for all opposite-sex activity and male and female same-sex sexual activity: \"Section 140: (1) Any person who – (...)

However, no one shall commit any of the following acts: having a child engage in lewd acts or arranging such acts, or committing sexual harassment or sexual abuse against a child that may make him/her feel sexually ashamed according to Article 17 of Child Welfare Act. The term \"child\" means a person who is under 18 years of age.\n\nThe age of consent in Sri Lanka is 16. However, girls belonging to Sri Lanka's Moor and Malay minorities representing approximately 10% of the national population are allowed to marry after 12 years of age and below the age of 12 with the approval of the religious leader, Moulavi and either father, brother, uncle, grandfather.\n\n363. A man is said to commit \"rape\" who enactment has sexual intercourse with, a woman under circumstances falling under any of the following descriptions:\n\n(e) \"with or without her consent\" when she is \"under sixteen years of age\", unless the woman is his wife who is over twelve years of age and is not judicially separated from the man.\n\n365B.\n(1) Grave sexual abuse is committed any person who, for sexual gratification, does any act, by the use of his genitals or any other part of the human body or any Instrument on any orifice or part of the body of any other person, being an act which does not amount to rape under section 363, in circumstances falling under any of the following descriptions, that is to say:\n\n(a) without the consent of the other person;\n\n(aa)\" with or without the consent\" of the other person when the other person is \"under sixteen years of age\";\n\nAny kind of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal in Syria\n\nThe age of consent in Syria is 18, per \"Article 491\".\n\n\"Article 491\":\n\n1.

The current legislation applies to all regardless of gender or sexual orientation.\n\nHowever, parts of the \"Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act\", which disallow any sexual contact with prostitutes under the age of 18, are widely interpreted by some local authorities to cover sexual acts classed as \"obscenity for personal gratification\". Also, from the \"Penal Code Amendment Act\"of 1997 Section 283bis, having sex with an adolescent under 18 is a compoundable offense even with the consent of that person. The parent or the adolescent may file charges against the other side if they later regret their own action. This ostensibly makes the Thai unfettered age of consent 18.\n\nA high-profile example of this application of the law was a statutory rape charge filed against the lead singer of the Thai band \"Big Ass\" for allegedly having had sex with a (then) 16-year-old girl. The charge was filed by the girl after the singer refused to take responsibility for her baby.

Several other sources indicate that the age of consent is 18.\n\nArticle 115 No. 1 states that, if an adult has had sexual intercourse with children aged from full 13 to under 16, shall be sentenced to between one and five years of imprisonment. In 2009, this article was amended to remove capital punishment. Article 112 Those who rape children aged between full 13 years and under 16 years shall be sentenced to between seven and fifteen years of imprisonment.\n\n\"Article 111.- Rape<br> \n\"4.

Those who have forcible sexual intercourse with children aged from full 13 years to under 16 years shall be sentenced to between five and ten years of imprisonment.\n\nAny kind of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal in Yemen. Until recently, Yemeni law set the age of consent at 15. But tribal customs often trump the law. In practice, \"Yemeni law allows girls of any age to wed, but it forbids sex with them until the indefinite time they’re 'suitable for sexual intercourse.'\" In 1999, the minimum marriage age of fifteen for women, rarely enforced, was abolished; the onset of puberty, interpreted by ulama to be at the age of nine, was set as a requirement for consummation of marriage.\n\nIn April 2008, the case of Nujood Ali, a 10-year-old girl who successfully obtained a divorce, sparked headlines around the world, and prompted calls to raise the legal age for marriage to 18. Later in 2008, the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood proposed to define the minimum age for marriage at 18 years. The law was passed in April 2009, but dropped the following day following maneuvers by opposing parliamentarians. Negotiations to pass the legislation continue. In September 2013, an 8-year-old girl died due to internal injuries caused by sexual intercourse with a 40-year-old man, after their arranged wedding.\n\n"}
{"id": "2575522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2575522", "title": "Agnes Nestor", "text": "Agnes Nestor\n\nAgnes Nestor (24 June 1880 – 28 December 1948) was an American labor leader, politician, and social reformer. She is best remembered for her membership and leadership roles in the International Glove Workers Union (IGWU) and the Women's Trade Union League (WTUL), where she organized for women's suffrage and workers' rights . Nestor's prominent activities included organizing women workers in Chicago in the early 1900s, running for public office, serving on national commissions to promote education, and securing work-hour limitations for women.\n\nAgnes Nestor was born on June 24, 1880, in Grand Rapids, Michigan to Thomas and Anna (McEwen) Nestor. Her father owned a grocery store there, but due to the depression of the 1890s he returned to his old trade as a machinist in Chicago, Illinois. In spring of 1897 Agnes and the rest of her family followed after their father and headed to Chicago; Agnes, still in her teens, found work in Chicago's Eisendrath Glove Company (a non-union shop). In her autobiography \"Woman's Labor Leader\", Nestor discusses the company's unjust practices such as: the company charged workers fifty cents a week for machine rental, workers had to provide their own needles (and if somebody was to break a needle they were charged for a new one to replace it), and also workers had to purchase their own machine oil, however, these unjust practices would not go unchallenged. In 1902 Nestor stepped forward as leader in a strike of women workers at the Eisendrath Glove Company (encouraged and supported by the unionised men), which lasted ten days. The strike was successful, all the women's demands were met; workers received a raise in pay, no longer had to pay rent for their machines, and the Eisendrath company took greater responsibility for their machinery, its greatest outcome being the implementation of a union shop.\n\nFollowing the success of the strike, Nestor took on more leadership roles. In 1902, the same small organization of women who took part in the Eisendrath Glove Company strike formed Glove Makers Local 2, with Agnes Nestor as a founder and leader. Nestor was the national vice president of the International Glove Workers Union from 1903 to 1906, secretary-treasurer from 1906 to 1913, general president from 1913 to 1915, vice-president, again, from 1915 to 1938, and director of research and education from 1938 until her death in 1948. As a leader in the International Glove Workers Union, Nestor gained prominence among labor leaders and earned access to network with notable women in Chicago society, many of whom she met through her involvement with women's clubs. Though there were differences between \"club women\" and \"working women,\" particularly in terms of class, domestic roles, and educational attainment, the relationship and outreach efforts Nestor built with club women were to further the agenda of the International Glove Workers Union.\n\nNestor was also an active member of the Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) of Chicago beginning in 1904, and served as its president from 1913 to 1948. Unlike other women's clubs, the Women's Trade Union League admitted women regardless of class, the club's aim was to secure the organization of all women workers of the U.S. into trade unions in the hopes of gaining better working conditions, a reduced work day, a living wage, and full citizenship of women. At the Women's Trade Union League, Nestor worked alongside prominent women labor leaders Mary Kenney O'Sullivan, Jane Addams, Mary McDowell, Margaret Haley, Helen Marot, Florence Kelley, and Sophonisba Breckinridge, together they were able to lobby, organize, fundraise, and create the WTUL into an influential and transformative organization.\n\nThe Women's Trade Union League seal exhibits the phrases \"The Eight Hour Day,\" \"A Living Wage,\" and \"To Guard the Home,\" thereby conveying the message that the WTUL believed that in advocating for reduced work hours, and raising wages, women workers would be able to better attend domestic responsibilities at home. They would come to work diligently to achieve the status they longed for displayed on their seal. For many years attempts were made by various labor groups to enact legislation to protect women workers from overlong working hours, from the dangers of unprotected machinery, and sweatshop conditions. The WTUL took action in composing a bill that would make the previous goals attainable, the bill called for an eight-hour day. They worked for three years gathering reports on conditions under which women were working, including unorganized women who did factory work in their own homes (these women had no standard wages, and payments ranged, the poorer the woman the worse the tragedies). The reports were presented in the Women's Trade Union League's first exhibit, which was called \"Exhibit of Dyanamic Sweatshops,\" they presented the eight-hour day bill as a health measure, because it was on those grounds that the Oregon ten-hour day was passed. The bill did not pass, Senator Jones suggested they exclude hotel and restaurant workers from the protection of the proposed law, and accept a ten-hour day, the WTUL refused to exclude any working women but did accept the ten-hour day, thus, in 1909 passed the Illinois ten-hour day (their proposed eight-hour day would be reached in 1937). \nThe topic of education for working women was just as crucial to the WTUL, they created an education program for working girls, in hopes of providing them with opportunities to explore cultural avenues which they had been denied from. In 1917, they worked out a plan with the Chicago Board of Education for the use of the classrooms of public schools (when they were not in use) to hold classes for the working women, Nestor particularly helped work out a course in the history of the trade-union movement. In 1918, Nestor joined a group organized by Samuel Gompers to travel on a Labor mission to Europe, the purpose of the mission was to cultivate international relationships between labor groups in the United States and in Europe and to demonstrate the readiness to help war-stricken Europe and cooperate once World War I ended.\n\nWhen Nestor returned to Chicago, she formed the Cooperative Glove Association of Chicago in 1921 to compete against non-union shops, but it failed in 1925 because it could not compete effectively. She became involved in politics, running unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for state legislature in 1928, serving on the Chicago Recreation Commission (1934), the Board of Trustees of Chicago's Century of Progress Exposition (1933-1934), and the Advisory Committee of the Chicago Planning Commission (1939). She opposed the National Woman's Party and the Equal Rights Amendment, arguing that they would not protect working women.\n\nBy the 1930s, the Great Depression would have effected both the WTUL and the IGWU financially, the latter suffered greater than the former. Even with such setback, Nestor continued her work as a labor leader and spent a lot of time fundraising for the unions. In the last decade of her life Nestor never retired, rather she spent her remaining years recruiting unorganized glove workers, and preventing the relaxation of labor laws during World War II \n\n\nNestor died on December 28, 1948 (aged 68) in Chicago of undisclosed causes.\n\n"}
{"id": "13605305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13605305", "title": "Androdioecy", "text": "Androdioecy\n\nAndrodioecy is a reproductive system characterized by the coexistence of males and hermaphrodites. Androdioecy is rare in comparison to the other major reproductive systems: dioecy, gynodioecy and hermaphroditism. In animals, androdioecy has been considered an important stepping stone in the transition from dioecy to hermaphroditism, and vice versa.\n\nThe fitness requirements for androdioecy to arise and sustain itself are theoretically so improbable that it was long considered that such systems do not exist. Particularly, males and hermaphrodites have to have the same fitness, in other words the same number of offspring, in order to be maintained. However, males only have offspring by fertilizing eggs or ovules of hermaphrodites, while hermaphrodites have offspring both through fertilizing eggs or ovules of other hermaphrodites and their own ovules. This means that all else being equal, males have to fertilize twice as many eggs or ovules as hermaphrodites to make up for the lack of female reproduction.\n\nAndrodioecy can evolve either from dioecious ancestors through the invasion of hermaphrodites or from hermaphroditic ancestors through the invasion of males. The ancestral state is important because conditions under which androdioecy can evolve differ significantly.\n\nIn roundworms, clam shrimp, tadpole shrimp and cancrid shrimps, androdioecy has evolved from dioecy. In these systems, hermaphrodites can only fertilize their own eggs (self-fertilize) and do not mate with other hermaphrodites. Males are the only means of outcrossing. Hermaphrodites may be beneficial in colonizing new habitats, because a single hermaphrodite can generate many other individuals. In the well-studied roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, males are very rare and only occur in populations that are in bad condition or stressed.\n\nIn animals, corals (phyla Cnidaria) and barnacles (Subphyla Crustacea), androdioecy has evolved from hermaphroditism. Many plants self-fertilize, and males may be sustained in a population when inbreeding depression is severe because males guarantee outcrossing.\n\nDespite their unlikely evolution, 115 androdioecious animal and about 50 androdioecious plant species are known. These species include\n\n\nRhabditidae (Order Rhabditida)\n\nDiplogastridae (Order Rhabditida)\nSteinernematidae (Order Rhabditida)\n\nAllanotnematidae (Order Rhabditida)\n\nDorylaimida\n\n\nClam shrimp\n\nTadpole shrimp\n\nBarnacles\n\nLysmata\n\nInsects\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some depictions with Gabriel date back to the 8th century, e.g. the stone casket at Notre Dame de Mortain church in France. He is very often present in scenes of the Last Judgement, but few other specific scenes, so most images including him are devotional rather than narrative. The angel who rescues Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego from the \"fiery furnace\" in the Book of is usually regarded in Christian tradition as Michael; this is sometimes represented in Early Christian art and Eastern Orthodox icons, but rarely in later art of the Western church. \n\nIn most depictions Michael is represented as an angelic warrior, fully armed with helmet, sword, and shield, in the style of a Byzantine officer, which is typically found even in Western depictions, though some late-medieval ones have him in contemporary knightly armour. Like other angels, in late-medieval Western art he may have what are known as feather tights, with large feathers over most of his body, as on the Holy Thorn Reliquary. He may be standing over a serpent, a dragon, or the defeated figure of Satan, whom he sometimes pierces with a lance. The iconography of Michael slaying a serpent goes back to the early 4th century, when Emperor Constantine defeated Licinius at the Battle of Adrianople in 324 AD, not far from the \"Michaelion\", a church dedicated to Archangel Michael. \n\nConstantine felt that Licinius was an agent of Satan, and associated him with the serpent described in the Book of Revelation (). After the victory, Constantine commissioned a depiction of himself and his sons slaying Licinius represented as a serpent - a symbolism borrowed from the Christian teachings on the Archangel to whom he attributed the victory. A similar painting, this time with the Archangel Michael himself slaying a serpent then became a major art piece at the Michaelion and eventually lead to the standard iconography of Archangel Michael as a warrior saint.\n\nIn other depictions Michael may be holding a pair of scales in which he weighs the souls of the departed and may hold the book of Life (as in the Book of Revelation), to show that he takes part in the judgment. However this form of depiction is less common than the slaying of the dragon. Michelangelo depicted this scene on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel. The shield may bears the Latin inscription \"Quis ut Deus\".\n\nIn Byzantine art Michael was often shown wearing the formal court robes and \"loros\" that were worn by the Emperor and his bodyguard on special occasions, rather than as a normal warrior who battled Satan or with scales for weighing souls on the Day of Judgement.\n\nThe widely reproduced image of \"Our Mother of Perpetual Help\", an icon of the Cretan school, depicts Michael on the left carrying the lance and sponge of the crucifixion of Jesus, with Gabriel on the right side of Mary and Jesus. \n\nIn Eastern Orthodox depictions, there are three icons of the Archangel Michael in whose composition he is said to have personally intervened: Archangel Michael of Mantamados in Mytilene, Archangel Michael of Panormitis and Archangel Michael of Nenita. Each of these icons is different.\n\n"}
{"id": "1090151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1090151", "title": "Border trade", "text": "Border trade\n\nBorder trade, in general, refers to the flow of goods and services across the\ninternational borders between jurisdictions. In this sense, it is a part of normal legal trade\nthat flows through standard export/import frameworks of nations. However border trade specifically refers to the \"increase\" in trade in areas where crossing borders is relatively easy and where products are significantly cheaper in one place than another, often because of significant variations in taxation levels on goods such as alcohol and tobacco.\n\nAs well as border trade across land or sea borders, air travel with a low-cost carrier can be worthwhile for a short international trip to the same purpose, although baggage restrictions can limit worthwhile savings to those for small high-value goods.\n\nWhere border trade is done for tax evasion it forms part of the underground economy of both jurisdictions.\n\nTypical examples of this are the borders between Ukraine and Russia, between Norway and Denmark/Sweden/Finland/Russia/Estonia and between Denmark/Switzerland and Germany. For instance, the excise tax on alcohol is lower in Estonia than in Finland and much lower than in Sweden, thus it is common to buy large volumes of alcohol when returning from Estonia: there are shops in the Tallinn harbour that cater specifically to tourists. In Finland, the best-selling Alko shops in proportion to local population is on the border to Norway, since even if the alcohol tax is high in Finland, it is lower than the one in Norway.\n\nBorder trading exists between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland; during the Global Financial Crisis, when the Euro rose against the British pound, so many from the Republic visited Newry—with lines of traffic four miles long—that the phenomenon became known as the \"Newry effect\". One in four households in the Republic in counties as far as Galway, four hours away from the border, shopped for groceries in Northern Ireland. Petrol is cheaper in the Republic, and groceries, furniture and clothing are cheaper in Northern Ireland.\n\nBetween the United Kingdom and France/Belgium, the booze cruise is a trip made specifically, or at least largely, to purchase cheaper alcohol and tobacco, and also goods offering different rates of VAT: laundry detergent, perhaps surprisingly, is a common purchase. Similarly, there is an important number of French purchasers buying tobacco and alcohol in Spanish border towns such as Le Perthus. In Spain, these products are a third cheaper than in France. During summer, around 70,000 visitors cross the Spanish border daily to buy such products, occasioning severe traffic jams. Nearby Andorra, with a low VAT (4%), is also extremely popular with French customers residing in the area.\n\nThere is a significant amount of border trade in marijuana between the Netherlands, where cannabis is essentially legal, and surrounding countries such as Belgium, Germany, and France.\n\nA more legal example of the Netherlands is the Limburg province, where citizens occasionally take trips to Germany and Belgium to buy commodities like: medicinal products, handcrafted furniture, fresh produce, alcoholic beverages or home appliances for far lower prices due to the VAT. This is very easy as there are no border controls due to the Schengen Agreement.\n\nResidents of Switzlerland and Liechtenstein who are non-EU residents can purchase many items in nearby Germany from anything from two to seven times the price they would pay for the same products in their own countries. Austria is also somewhat cheaper than Switzerland. Residents of Switzerland usually qualify for a tax refund on purchases made in all of the surrounding EU countries making cross border shopping even more attractive, particularly in Germany where there is no minimum-purchase requirement for claiming the tax back.\n\nCross-border shopping between three countries in Canada, Mexico, and the United States is robust. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has reduced barriers and tariffs, facilitating cross-border trade. Each day 2008, $2 billion of cross-border trade was conducted between Canada and the United States alone. Consumers take part in cross-border trading to broaden their product selection, gain access to a larger market place, or take advantage of currency volatility. Online commerce has taken on a more prominent role in recent years and gives consumers a convenient platform for cross-border shopping. However, additional border costs such as duties, brokerage and shipping are not always disclosed up front or even known to the retailer, leading to a situation where the final cost of an item can greatly exceed expectations. Dedicated cross-border shopping solutions such as Wishabi, and Canada Post’s Borderfree exist to mitigate these problems with varied success. In the end, caution is necessary to determine the final cost of goods before purchase.\n\nMany Singaporeans also travel to Johor Bahru in Malaysia or Batam in Indonesia, to take advantage of price differences and differing product availability. The Singaporean government has a law that requires a car leaving Singapore to have the fuel tank filled by at least 75 percent, to prevent it from being filled with fuel from outside Singapore.\n\nShenzhen, on the border of \"mainland China\" with the special region of Hong Kong, also benefits from border trade.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "197112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197112", "title": "Bumblebee", "text": "Bumblebee\n\nA bumblebee (or bumble bee, bumble-bee or humble-bee) is any of over 250 species in the genus Bombus, part of Apidae, one of the bee families. This genus is the only extant group in the tribe Bombini, though a few extinct related genera (e.g., \"Calyptapis\") are known from fossils. They are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, although they are also found in South America where a few lowland tropical species have been identified. European bumblebees have also been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania. Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly, but generally ignore humans and other animals. \n\nMost bumblebees are social insects that form colonies with a single queen. The colonies are smaller than those of honey bees, growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest. Cuckoo bumblebees are brood parasitic and do not make nests; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species, kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs, which are cared for by the resident workers. Cuckoo bumblebees were previously classified as a separate genus, but are now usually treated as members of \"Bombus\".\n\nBumblebees have round bodies covered in soft hair (long branched setae) called \"pile\", making them appear and feel fuzzy. They have aposematic (warning) coloration, often consisting of contrasting bands of colour, and different species of bumblebee in a region often resemble each other in mutually protective Müllerian mimicry. Harmless insects such as hoverflies often derive protection from resembling bumblebees, in Batesian mimicry, and may be confused with them. Nest-making bumblebees can be distinguished from similarly large, fuzzy cuckoo bees by the form of the female hind leg. In nesting bumblebees, it is modified to form a pollen basket, a bare shiny area surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport pollen, whereas in cuckoo bees, the hind leg is hairy all round, and pollen grains are wedged among the hairs for transport.\n\nLike their relatives the honeybees, bumblebees feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar to add to the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees steal nectar, making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.\n\nThe word \"bumblebee\" is a compound of \"bumble\" + \"bee\"—\"bumble\" meaning to hum, buzz, drone, or move ineptly or flounderingly. The generic name \"Bombus\", assigned by Pierre André Latreille in 1802, is derived from the Latin word for a buzzing or humming sound.\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the term \"bumblebee\" was first recorded as having been used in the English language in the 1530 work \"Lesclarcissement\" by John Palsgrave, \"I bomme, as a bombyll bee dothe.\" However the OED also states that the term \"humblebee\" predates it, having first been used in 1450 in \"Fysshynge wyth Angle\", \"In Juyll the greshop & the humbylbee in the medow.\" The latter term was used in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (\"circa\" 1600) by William Shakespeare, \"The honie-bags steale from the humble Bees.\"\n\nAn old provincial name, \"dumbledor\", also denoted a buzzing insect such as a bumblebee or cockchafer, \"dumble\" probably imitating the sound of these insects, while \"dor\" meant \"beetle\".\n\nIn \"On the Origin of Species\" (1859), Charles Darwin speculated about \"humble-bees\" and their interactions with other species:\n\nHowever, \"bumblebee\" remained in use, for example in \"The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse\" (1910) by Beatrix Potter, \"Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble--\"Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!\" said the bumble bee.\" Since World War II \"humblebee\" has fallen into near-total disuse.\n\nThe bumblebee tribe Bombini is one of four groups of corbiculate bees (those with pollen baskets) in the Apidae, the others being the Apini (honeybees), Euglossini (orchid bees), and Meliponini (stingless bees). The corbiculate bees are a monophyletic group. Advanced eusocial behaviour appears to have evolved twice in the group, giving rise to controversy, now largely settled, as to the phylogenetic origins of the four tribes; it had been supposed that eusocial behaviour had evolved only once, requiring the Apini to be close to the Meliponini, which they do not resemble. It is now thought that the Apini (with advanced societies) and Euglossini are closely related, while the primitively eusocial Bombini are close to the Meliponini, which have somewhat more advanced eusocial behaviour. Sophie Cardinal and Bryan Danforth comment that \"While remarkable, a hypothesis of dual origins of advanced eusociality is congruent with early studies on corbiculate morphology and social behavior.\" Their analysis, combining molecular, morphological and behavioural data, gives the following cladogram:\n\nOn this hypothesis, the molecular data suggest that the Bombini are 25 to 40 million years old, while the Meliponini (and thus the clade that includes the Bombini and Meliponini) are 81 to 96 million years old, about the same age as the corbiculate group.\n\nHowever, a more recent phylogeny using transcriptome data from 3,647 genes of ten corbiculate bee species supports the single origin of eusociality hypothesis in the corbiculate bees. They find that Bombini is in fact sister to Meliponini, corroborating that previous finding from Sophie Cardinal and Bryan Danforth (2011). However, Romiguier et al. (2015) shows that Bombini, Meliponini, and Apini form a monophyletic group, where Apini shares a most recent common ancestor with the Bombini and Meliponini clade, while Euglossini is most distantly related to all three, since it does not share the same most recent common ancestor as Bombini, Meliponini, and Apini. Thus, their analysis supports the single origin of eusociality hypothesis within the corbiculate bees, where eusociality evolved in the common ancestor of Bombini, Apini, and Meliponini. \n\nThe fossil record for bees is incomplete. Around 11 specimens that might possibly be Bombini, some poorly documented, had been described by 2011; some (such as \"Calyptapis florissantensis\" from Florissant, USA, and \"Oligoapis beskonakensis\" from , Turkey) dated from the Oligocene. In 2012 a fossil bumblebee, \"Bombus (Bombus) randeckensis\" was described from the Miocene Randeck Maar in southwestern Germany and confidently placed in the subgenus \"Bombus\".\nIn 2014, another species, \"Bombus cerdanyensis\", was described from Late Miocene lacustrine beds of La Cerdanya, Spain, but not placed into any subgenus, while a new genus and species, \"Oligobombus cuspidatus\" was described from the late Eocene Bembridge Marls of the Isle of Wight. The species \"Bombus trophonius\" was described in October 2017 and placed in \"Bombus\" subgenus \"Cullumanobombus\".\n\nThe genus \"Bombus\", the only one extant genus in the tribe Bombini, comprises over 250 species; for an overview of the differences between bumblebees and other bees and wasps, see characteristics of common wasps and bees. The genus has been divided variously into up to 49 subgenera, a degree of complexity criticised by Williams (2008). The cuckoo bumblebees \"Psithyrus\" have sometimes been treated as a separate genus but are now considered to be part of \"Bombus\", in one or more subgenera.\n\nExamples of \"Bombus\" species include \"Bombus atratus, Bombus dahlbomii, Bombus fervidus, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus ruderatus,\" and \"Bombus rupestris.\"\n\nBumblebees vary in appearance, but are generally plump and densely furry. They are larger, broader and stouter-bodied than honeybees, and their abdomen tip is more rounded. Many species have broad bands of colour, the patterns helping to distinguish different species. Whereas honeybees have short tongues and therefore mainly pollinate open flowers, some bumblebee species have long tongues and collect nectar from flowers that are closed into a tube. Bumblebees have fewer stripes (or none), and usually have part of the body covered in black fur, while honeybees have many stripes including several grey stripes on the abdomen. Sizes are very variable even within species; the largest British species, \"B. terrestris\", has queens up to long, males up to long, and workers between long. The largest bumblebee species in the world is \"B. dahlbomii\" of Chile, up to about long, and described as \"flying mice\" and \"a monstrous fluffy ginger beast\". \n\nBumblebees are typically found in temperate climates, and are often found at higher latitudes and altitudes than other bees, although a few lowland tropical species exist. A few species (\"B. polaris\" and \"B. alpinus\") range into very cold climates where other bees might not be found; \"B. polaris\" occurs in northern Ellesmere Island in the high Arctic, along with another bumblebee \"B. hyperboreus\", which parasitises its nest. This is the most northernmost occurrence of any eusocial insect. One reason for their presence in cold places is that bumblebees can regulate their body temperature, via solar radiation, internal mechanisms of \"shivering\" and radiative cooling from the abdomen (called heterothermy). Other bees have similar physiology, but the mechanisms seem best developed and have been most studied in bumblebees. They adapt to higher elevations by extending their wing stroke amplitude. Bumblebees have a largely cosmopolitan distribution but are absent from Australia (apart from Tasmania where they have been introduced) and are found in Africa only north of the Sahara. More than a hundred years ago they have also been introduced to New Zealand, where they play an important role as efficient pollinators.\n\nThe bumblebee tongue (the proboscis) is a long, hairy structure that extends from a sheath-like modified maxilla. The primary action of the tongue is lapping, that is, repeated dipping of the tongue into liquid. \nThe tip of the tongue probably acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, which resulted in a small reward.\n\nThe exoskeleton of the abdomen is divided into plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites. Wax is secreted from glands on the abdomen and extruded between the sternites where it resembles flakes of dandruff. It is secreted by the queen when she starts a nest and by young workers. It is scraped from the abdomen by the legs, moulded until malleable and used in the construction of honeypots, to cover the eggs, to line empty cocoons for use as storage containers and sometimes to cover the exterior of the nest.\n\nThe brightly coloured pile of the bumblebee is an aposematic (warning) signal, given that females can inflict a painful sting. Depending on the species and morph, the warning colours range from entirely black, to bright yellow, red, orange, white, and pink. Dipteran flies in the families Syrphidae (hoverflies), Asilidae (robber flies), Tabanidae (horseflies), Oestridae (bot or warble flies) and Bombyliidae (bee flies) all include Batesian mimics of bumblebees, resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators.\n\nMany species of \"Bombus\", including the group sometimes called \"Psithyrus\" (cuckoo bumblebees), have evolved Müllerian mimicry, where the different bumblebees in a region resemble each other, so that a young predator need only learn to avoid any of them once. For example, in California a group of bumblebees consists of largely black species including \"B. californicus\", \"B. caliginosus\", \"B. vandykei\", \"B. vosnesenskii\", \"B. insularis\" and \"B. fernaldae\". Other bees in California include a group of species all banded black and yellow. In each case, Müllerian mimicry provides the bees in the group with a selective advantage. In addition, parasitic (cuckoo) bumblebees resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance, at least in areas like Europe where parasite-host co-speciation is common; but this too may be explained as Müllerian mimicry, rather than requiring the parasite's coloration to deceive the host (aggressive mimicry).\n\nBumblebees are active in conditions when honeybees stay at home, and can readily absorb heat from even weak sunshine. The thick pile created by long setae (bristles) acts as insulation to keep bumblebees warm in cold weather; species from cold climates have longer setae (and thus thicker insulation) than those from the tropics. The temperature of the flight muscles, which occupy much of the thorax, needs to be at least before flight can take place. The muscle temperature can be raised by shivering. It takes about five minutes for the muscles to reach this temperature at an air temperature of .\n\nThe chill-coma temperature in relation to flying insects is the temperature at which flight muscles cannot be activated. Compared to honey bees and carpenter bees, bumblebees have the lowest chill-coma temperature. Of the bumblebees \"Bombus bimaculatus\" has the lowest at . However, bumblebees have been seen to fly in colder ambient temperatures. This discrepancy is likely because the chill-coma temperature was determined by tests done in a laboratory setting. However, bumblebees live in insulated shelters and can shiver to warm up before venturing into the cold.\n\nBumblebees do not have ears, and it is not known whether or how well they can hear. However, they are sensitive to the vibrations made by sound travelling through wood or other materials.\n\nBumblebees do not exhibit the \"bee dances\" used by honeybees to tell other workers the locations of food sources. Instead, when they return from a successful foraging expedition, they run excitedly around in the nest for several minutes before going out to forage once more. These bees may be offering some form of communication based on the buzzing sounds made by their wings, which may stimulate other bees to start foraging. Another stimulant to foraging activity is the level of food reserves in the colony. Bees monitor the amount of honey in the honeypots, and when little is left or when high quality food is added, they are more likely to go out to forage.\n\nBumblebees have been observed to partake in social learning. In a 2017 study involving \"Bombus terrestris\", bees were taught to complete an unnatural task of moving large objects to obtain a reward. Bees that first observed another bee complete the task were significantly more successful in learning the task than bees that observed the same action performed by a magnet, indicating the importance of social information. The bees did not copy each other exactly: in fact, the study suggested that the bees were instead attempting to emulate each other's goals.\n\nNest size depends on species of bumblebee. Most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals, but colonies have been documented as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees. Many species nest underground, choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places, and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight that could result in overheating. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter.\n\nIn the early spring, the queen comes out of diapause and finds a suitable place to create her colony. Then she builds wax cells in which to lay her eggs which were fertilised the previous year. The eggs that hatch develop into female workers, and in time, the queen populates the colony, with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers. In temperate zones, young queens (gynes) leave the nest in the autumn and mate, often more than once, with males (drones) that are forcibly driven out of the colony. The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter. They survive in a resting state (diapause), generally below ground, until the weather warms up in the spring with the early bumblebee being the species that is among the first to emerge. Many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year. \"Bombus pensylvanicus\" is a species that follows this type of colony cycle. For this species the cycle begins in February, reproduction starts in July or August, and ends in the winter months. The queen remains in hibernation until spring of the following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest.\n\nIn fertilised queens, the ovaries only become active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina where there is a chamber called the spermatheca, in which the sperm from the mating is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens. The hormones that stimulate the development of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.\n\nTo develop, the larvae must be fed both nectar for carbohydrates and pollen for protein. Bumblebees feed nectar to the larvae by chewing a small hole in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar. Larvae are fed pollen in one of two ways, depending on the bumblebee species. Pocket-making bumblebees create pockets of pollen at the base of the brood-cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves. Pollen-storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larvae.\nAfter the emergence of the first or second group of offspring, workers take over the task of foraging and the queen spends most of her time laying eggs and caring for larvae. The colony grows progressively larger and eventually begins to produce males and new queens.\nBumblebee workers can lay unfertilised haploid eggs (with only a single set of chromosomes) that develop into viable male bumblebees. Only fertilised queens can lay diploid eggs (one set of chromosomes from a drone, one from the queen) that mature into workers and new queens.\n\nIn a young colony, the queen minimises reproductive competition from workers by suppressing their egg-laying through physical aggression and pheromones. Worker policing leads to nearly all eggs laid by workers being eaten. Thus, the queen is usually the mother of all of the first males laid. Workers eventually begin to lay male eggs later in the season when the queen's ability to suppress their reproduction diminishes. Because of the reproductive competition between workers and the queen, bumblebees are considered \"primitively eusocial\".\n\nAlthough a large majority of bumblebees follow such monogynous colony cycles that only involve one queen, some select Bombus species (such as \"Bombus atratus\") will spend part of their life cycle in a polygynous phase (have multiple queens in one nest during these periods of polygyny).\n\nBumblebees generally visit flowers that exhibit the bee pollination syndrome and these patches of flowers may be up to 1–2 km from their colony. They tend to visit the same patches of flowers every day, as long as they continue to find nectar and pollen there, a habit known as pollinator or flower constancy. While foraging, bumblebees can reach ground speeds of up to .\n\nBumblebees use a combination of colour and spatial relationships to learn which flowers to forage from. They can also detect both the presence and the pattern of electric fields on flowers, which occur due to atmospheric electricity, and take a while to leak away into the ground. They use this information to find out if a flower has been recently visited by another bee. Bumblebees can detect the temperature of flowers, as well as which parts of the flower are hotter or cooler and use this information to recognise flowers. After arriving at a flower, they extract nectar using their long tongues (\"glossae\") and store it in their crops. Many species of bumblebees also exhibit \"nectar robbing\": instead of inserting the mouthparts into the flower in the normal way, these bees bite directly through the base of the corolla to extract nectar, avoiding pollen transfer.\n\nPollen is removed from flowers deliberately or incidentally by bumblebees. Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees come in contact with the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar. When it enters a flower, the bumblebee's body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers. In queens and workers this is then groomed into the corbiculae (pollen baskets) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains. Male bumblebees do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect pollen. Bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination, in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles.\n\nIn at least some species, once a bumblebee has visited a flower, it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and may be able to identify who else has visited a flower. Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower.\n\nOnce they have collected nectar and pollen, female workers return to the nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells, or into wax cells for storage. Unlike honeybees, bumblebees only store a few days' worth of food, so are much more vulnerable to food shortages. Male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves. They may visit quite different flowers from the workers because of their different nutritional needs.\n\nBees beat their wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not contract on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and are found in the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees can reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30 °C (86 °F) using this method.\n\nBumblebees of the subgenus \"Psithyrus\" (known as 'cuckoo bumblebees', and formerly considered a separate genus) are brood parasites, sometimes called kleptoparasites, in the colonies of other bumblebees, and have lost the ability to collect pollen. Before finding and invading a host colony, a \"Psithyrus\" female, such as that of the \"Psithyrus\" species of \"B. sylvestris,\" feeds directly from flowers. Once she has infiltrated a host colony, the \"Psithyrus\" female kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and uses pheromones and physical attacks to force the workers of that colony to feed her and her young. Usually, cuckoo bumblebees can be described as queen-intolerant inquilines, since the host queen is often killed to enable the parasite to produce more offspring, though some species, such as \"B. bohemicus\", actually enjoy increased success when they leave the host queen alive.\n\nThe female \"Psithyrus\" has a number of morphological adaptations for combat, such as larger mandibles, a tough cuticle and a larger venom sac that increase her chances of taking over a nest. Upon emerging from their cocoons, the \"Psithyrus\" males and females disperse and mate. The males do not survive the winter but, like nonparasitic bumblebee queens, \"Psithyrus\" females find suitable locations to spend the winter and enter diapause after mating. They usually emerge from hibernation later than their host species. Each species of cuckoo bee has a specific host species, which it may physically resemble. In the case of the parasitism of \"B. terrestris\" by \"B. (Psithyrus) vestalis\", genetic analysis of individuals captured in the wild showed that about 42% of the host species' nests at a single location had \"[lost] their fight against their parasite\".\n\nQueen and worker bumblebees can sting. Unlike in honeybees, a bumblebee's sting lacks barbs, so the bee can sting repeatedly without injuring itself; by the same token, the sting is not left in the wound. Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive, but may sting in defence of their nest, or if harmed. Female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members, and sting the host queen, but ignore other animals unless disturbed.\n\nBumblebees, despite their ability to sting, are eaten by certain predators. Nests may be dug up by badgers and eaten whole, including any adults present. Adults are preyed upon by robber flies and beewolves in North America. In Europe, birds including bee-eaters and shrikes capture adult bumblebees on the wing; smaller birds such as great tits also occasionally learn to take bumblebees, while camouflaged crab spiders catch them as they visit flowers.\nThe great grey shrike is able to detect flying bumblebees up to 100 metres away; once captured, the sting is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen on a branch. The European honey buzzard follows flying bees back to their nest, digs out the nest with its feet, and eats larvae, pupae and adults as it finds them.\n\nBumblebees are parasitised by tracheal mites, \"Locustacarus buchneri\"; protozoans including \"Crithidia bombi\" and \"Apicystis bombi\"; and microsporidians including \"Nosema bombi\" and \"Nosema ceranae\". The tree bumblebee \"B. hypnorum\" has spread into the United Kingdom despite hosting high levels of a nematode that normally interferes with queen bees' attempts to establish colonies. Deformed wing virus has been found to affect 11% of bumblebees in Great Britain.\n\nFemale Bee Moths \"(Aphomia sociella)\" prefer to lay their eggs in bumblebee nests. The A. sociella larvae will then feed on the eggs, larvae, and pupae left unprotected by the bumble bees, sometimes destroying large parts of the nest.\n\nBumblebees are important pollinators of both crops and wildflowers. Because bumblebees do not overwinter the entire colony, they do not stockpile honey, and therefore are not useful as honey producers. Bumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators, among other reasons because they can pollinate plants such as tomato in greenhouses by buzz pollination whereas other pollinators cannot. Commercial production began in 1987, when Roland De Jonghe founded the Biobest company; in 1988 they produced enough nests to pollinate 40 hectares of tomatoes. The industry grew quickly, starting with other companies in the Netherlands. Bumblebee nests, mainly of buff-tailed bumblebees, are produced in at least 30 factories around the world; over a million nests are grown annually in Europe; Turkey is a major producer.\n\nBumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals. When red clover was introduced as a crop to New Zealand in the nineteenth century, it was found to have no local pollinators, and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, red clover was soon being produced from locally-grown seed. Bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses. The New Zealand population of buff-tailed bumblebees naturally colonised Tasmania, 1,500 miles away, in 1992.\n\nSome concerns exist about the impact of the international trade in mass-produced bumblebee colonies. Evidence from Japan and South America indicates bumblebees can escape and naturalise in new environments, causing damage to native pollinators. Greater use of native pollinators, such as \"Bombus ignitus\" in China and Japan, has occurred as a result. In addition, mounting evidence indicates mass-produced bumblebees may also carry diseases, harmful to wild bumblebees and honeybees.\n\nIn Canada and Sweden it has been shown that growing a mosaic of different crops encourages bumblebees and provides higher yields than does a monoculture of oilseed rape, despite the fact that the bees were attracted to the crop.\n\nBumblebee species are declining in Europe, North America, and Asia due to a number of factors, including land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus \"Bombus\". A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the genus \"Bombus\". The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species \"Bombus hortorum\" in particular has been found to be impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.\n\nBumblebees are in danger in many developed countries due to habitat destruction and collateral pesticide damage. The European Food Safety Authority ruled that three neonicotinoid pesticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam) presented a high risk for bees. While most work on neonicotinoid toxicity has looked at honeybees, a study on \"B. terrestris\" showed that \"field-realistic\" levels of imidacloprid significantly reduced growth rate and cut production of new queens by 85%, implying a \"considerable negative effect\" on wild bumblebee populations throughout the developed world.\nHowever, in another study, following chronic exposure to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam, colony weight gain was not affected, nor were the number or mass of sexuals produced. Low levels of neonicotinoids can reduce the number of bumblebees in a colony by as much as 55%, and cause dysfunction in the bumblebees' brains. The Bumblebee Conservation Trust considers this evidence of reduced brain function \"particularly alarming given that bumblebees rely upon their intelligence to go about their daily tasks.\" A study on \"B. terrestris\" had results that suggests that use of neonicotinoid pesticides can affect how well bumblebees are able to forage and pollinate. Bee colonies that had been affected by the pesticide released more foragers and collected more pollen than bees who had not been dosed with neonicotinoid. Although the bees affected by the pesticide were able to collect more pollen, they took a longer amount of time doing so.\n\nOf 19 species of native nestmaking bumblebees and six species of cuckoo bumblebees formerly widespread in Britain, three have been extirpated, eight are in serious decline, and only six remain widespread. Similar declines have been reported in Ireland, with four species designated endangered, and another two considered vulnerable to extinction. A decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large-scale changes to the countryside, resulting from inadequate pollination of certain plants.\n\nSome bumblebees native to North America are also vanishing, such as \"Bombus balteatus\", \"Bombus terricola\", \"Bombus affinis\", and \"Bombus occidentalis\", and one, \"Bombus franklini\", may be extinct. In South America, \"Bombus bellicosus\" was extirpated in the northern limit of its distribution range, probably due to intense land use and climate change effects.\n\nIn 2006 the bumblebee researcher Dave Goulson founded a registered charity, the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, to prevent the extinction \"of any of the UK's bumblebees.\" In 2009 and 2010, the Trust attempted to reintroduce the short-haired bumblebee, \"Bombus subterraneus\", which had become extinct in Britain, from the British-derived populations surviving in New Zealand from their introduction there a century earlier. From 2011 the Trust, in partnership with Natural England, Hymettus and the RSPB, has reintroduced short-haired bumblebee queens from Skåne in southern Sweden to restored flower-rich meadows at Dungeness in Kent. The queens were checked for mites and American foulbrood disease. Agri-environment schemes spread across the neighbouring area of Romney Marsh have been set up to provide over 800 hectares of additional flower-rich habitat for the bees. By the summer of 2013, workers of the species were found near the release zone, proving that nests had been established. The restored habitat has produced a revival in at least five \"Schedule 41 priority\" species: the ruderal bumblebee, \"Bombus ruderatus\"; the red-shanked carder bee, \"Bombus ruderarius\"; the shrill carder bee, \"Bombus sylvarum\"; the brown-banded carder bee, \"Bombus humilis\" and the moss carder bee, \"Bombus muscorum\".\n\nThe world's first bumblebee sanctuary was established at Vane Farm in the Loch Leven National Nature Reserve in Scotland in 2008. In 2011, London's Natural History Museum led the establishment of an International Union for the Conservation of Nature Bumblebee Specialist Group, chaired by Dr. Paul H. Williams, to assess the threat status of bumblebee species worldwide using Red List criteria.\n\nBumblebee conservation is in its infancy in many parts of the world, but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts are being made to manage farmland better. Enhancing the wild bee population can be done by the planting of wildflower strips, and in New Zealand, bee nesting boxes have achieved some success, perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country.\n\nAccording to 20th-century folklore, the laws of aerodynamics prove the bumblebee should be incapable of flight, as it does not have the capacity (in terms of wing size or beats per second) to achieve flight with the degree of wing loading necessary.\n\nThe origin of this claim has been difficult to pin down with any certainty. John H. McMasters recounted an anecdote about an unnamed Swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed some rough calculations and concluded, presumably in jest, that according to the equations, bumblebees cannot fly. In later years, McMasters backed away from this origin, suggesting there could be multiple sources, and the earliest he has found was a reference in the 1934 book \"\" by French entomologist Antoine Magnan (1881–1938); they had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found their flight was impossible, but \"One shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality\".\n\nThe following passage appears in the introduction to \"Le Vol des Insectes\":\n\nThis translates to:\n\nMagnan refers to his assistant André Sainte-Laguë. Some credit physicist Ludwig Prandtl (1875–1953) of the University of Göttingen in Germany with popularizing the idea. Others say Swiss gas dynamicist Jacob Ackeret (1898–1981) did the calculations.\n\nThe calculations that purported to show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.\n\nAdditionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted biologist with a strong background in aeronautics, has pointed out that bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.\n\nThe orchestral interlude \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" was composed (c. 1900) by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. It represents the turning of Prince Guidon into a bumblebee so he can fly away to visit his father, Tsar Saltan, in the opera \"The Tale of Tsar Saltan\", although the music may reflect the flight of a bluebottle rather than a bumblebee. The music inspired Walt Disney to feature a bumblebee in his 1940 animated musical \"Fantasia\" and have it sound as if it were flying in all parts of the theater. This early attempt at \"surround sound\" was unsuccessful, and the music was excluded from the film's release.\n\nIn 1599, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, someone, possibly Tailboys Dymoke, published \"Caltha Poetarum: Or The Bumble Bee\", under the pseudonym \"T. Cutwode\". This was one of nine books censored under the Bishop's Ban issued by the Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift and the Bishop of London Richard Bancroft.\nEmily Dickinson made a bumblebee the subject of her parody of Isaac Watts's well-known poem about honeybees, \"How Doth the Little Busy Bee\" (1715). Where Watts wrote \"How skilfully she builds her cell! How neat she spreads the wax!\", Dickinson's poem, \"The Bumble-Bee's Religion\" (1881) begins \"His little Hearse-like Figure / Unto itself a Dirge / To a delusive Lilac / The vanity divulge / Of Industry and Morals / And every righteous thing / For the divine Perdition / of Idleness and Spring.\" The letter was said to have enclosed a dead bee.\n\nThe entomologist Otto Plath wrote \"Bumblebees and Their Ways\" in 1934. His daughter, the poet Sylvia Plath, wrote a group of poems about bees late in 1962, within four months of her suicide, transforming her father's interest into her poetry.\nThe scientist and illustrator Moses Harris (1731–1785) painted accurate watercolour drawings of bumblebees in his \"An Exposition of English Insects Including the Several Classes of Neuroptera, Hymenoptera, & Diptera, or Bees, Flies, & Libellulae (1776–80)\".\n\nBumblebees appear as characters, often eponymously, in children's books. The surname Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series (1997–2007) is an old name for bumblebee. J. K. Rowling said the name \"seemed to suit the headmaster, because one of his passions is music and I imagined him walking around humming to himself\". J. R. R. Tolkien, in his poem \"Errantry\", also used the name Dumbledor, but for a large bee-like creature.\n\nAmong the many books for younger children are \"Bumble the Bee\" by Yvon Douran and Tony Neal (2014); \"Bertie Bumble Bee\" by K. I. Al-Ghani (2012); \"Ben the Bumble Bee: How do bees make honey?\" by Romessa Awadalla (2015); \"Bumble Bee Bob Has a Big Butt\" by Papa Campbell (2012); \"Buzz, Buzz, Buzz! Went Bumble-bee\" by Colin West (1997); \"Bumble Bee\" by Margaret Wise Brown (2000); \"How the Bumble Came to Bee\" by Paul and Ella Quarry (2012); \"The Adventures of Professor Bumble and the Bumble Bees\" by Stephen Brailovsky (2010). Among Beatrix Potter's \"little books\", Babbity Bumble and other members of her nest appear in \"The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse\" (1910).\n\nBumblebee is the name of a prominent character in the Transformers franchise. His name denotes his black-on-yellow vehicle paint job, directly referencing the bee genus because of its black and yellow stripes. \"Bumblebee\" is also the name of an automotive racing stripe that wraps around the grill instead of down the centre of the vehicle; it can be found mainly on Chevrolet Camaros (which happens to be the Transformers Autobot's most popular vehicle mode).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3204439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3204439", "title": "Bush tucker", "text": "Bush tucker\n\nBush tucker, also called bushfood, is any food native to Australia and used as sustenance by the original inhabitants, the Aboriginal Australians, but it can also describe any native fauna or flora used for culinary and/or medicinal purposes, regardless of the continent or culture. Examples of Australian native animal foods (meats) include kangaroo, emu and crocodile. In particular, kangaroo is quite common and can be found in Australian supermarkets, often cheaper than beef. Other animals, for example goanna and witchetty grubs, were eaten by Aboriginal Australians. Fish and shellfish are culinary features of the Australian coastal communities.\n\nExamples of Australian native plant foods include the fruits quandong, kutjera, muntries, riberry, Davidson's plum, and finger lime. Native spices include lemon myrtle, mountain pepper, and aniseed myrtle. A popular leafy vegetable is warrigal greens. Nuts include bunya nut, and the most identifiable bush tucker plant harvested and sold in large-scale commercial quantities is the macadamia nut. Knowledge of Aboriginal uses of fungi is meagre but beefsteak fungus and native \"bread\" (a fungus also), were certainly eaten.\n\nAboriginal Australians have eaten native animal and plant foods for an estimated 60,000 years of human habitation on the Australian continent (\"see Indigenous Australian food groups, Australian Aboriginal sweet foods)\". Various traditional methods of processing and cooking are used. Toxic seeds, such as \"Cycas media\" and Moreton Bay chestnut, are processed to remove the toxins and render them safe to eat. Many foods are also baked in the hot campfire coals, or baked for several hours in ground ovens. \"Paperbark\", the bark of \"Melaleuca\" species, is widely used for wrapping food placed in ground ovens. Bush bread was made by males using many types of seeds, nuts and corns to process a flour or dough to make bread.\n\nAboriginal traditional native food use has been severely affected by non-indigenous immigration since 1788, especially in the more densely colonised areas of south-eastern Australia. There, the introduction of non-native foods to Aboriginals has resulted in an almost complete abandonment of native foods by Aboriginals. This impact on traditional foods has been further accentuated by the loss of traditional lands which has resulted in reduced access to native foods by Aboriginals and destruction of native habitat for agriculture.\n\nThe recent recognition of the nutritional and gourmet value of native foods by non-indigenous Australians is introducing native cuisine to many for the first time.\n\nBush tucker provided a source of nutrition to the non-indigenous colonial settlers, often supplementing meager rations. However, bushfoods were often considered to be inferior by colonists unfamiliar with the new land's food ingredients, generally preferring familiar foods from their homelands.\n\nIn the 19th century English botanist, J.D. Hooker, writing of Australian plants in \"Flora of Tasmania\", remarked although \"eatable,\" are not \"fit to eat\". In 1889, botanist Joseph Maiden reiterated this sentiment with the comment on native food plants \"nothing to boast of as eatables.\" The first monograph to be published on the flora of Australia reported the lack of edible plants on the first page, where it presented \"Billardiera scandens\" as, \"... almost the only wild eatable fruit of the country\".\n\nThis became the accepted view of Australian native food plants until the late 20th century. It is thought that these early assessments were a result of encountering strong flavours not generally suitable for out-of-hand eating, but these strong flavours are now highly regarded for culinary use.\n\nThe only Australian native plant food developed and cropped on a large scale is the macadamia nut, with the first small-scale commercial plantation being planted in Australia in the 1880s. Subsequently, Hawaii was where the macadamia was commercially developed to its greatest extent from stock imported from Australia.\n\nIn the 1970s non-indigenous Australians began to recognise the previously overlooked native Australian foods. Textbooks like \"Wildfoods in Australia\" by the botanist couple Cribb & Cribb were popular. In the late 1970s horticulturists started to assess native food-plants for commercial use and cultivation.\n\nIn 1980 South Australia legalised the sale of kangaroo meat for human consumption. Analysis showed that a variety of bushfoods were exceptionally nutritious. In the mid-1980s several Sydney restaurants began using native Australian ingredients in recipes more familiar to non-indigenous tastes – providing the first opportunity for bushfoods to be tried by non-indigenous Australians on a serious gourmet level. This led to the realisation that many strongly flavoured native food plants have spice-like qualities.\n\nFollowing popular TV programs on \"bush tucker\", a surge in interest in the late 1980s saw the publication of books like \"Bushfood: Aboriginal Food and Herbal Medicine\" by Jennifer Isaacs, \"The Bushfood Handbook\" and \"Uniquely Australian\" by Vic Cherikoff, and \"Wild Food Plants of Australia\" by Tim Low.\n\nBush tucker ingredients were initially harvested from the wild, but cultivated sources have become increasingly important to provide sustainable supplies for a growing market, with some Aboriginal communities also involved in the supply chain. However, despite the industry being founded on Aboriginal knowledge of the plants, Aboriginal participation in the commercial sale of bush tucker is currently still marginal, and mostly at the supply end of value chains. Organisations are working to increase Aboriginal participation in the bush tucker market. Gourmet style processed food and dried food have been developed for the domestic and export markets.\n\nThe term \"bushfood\" is one of several terms describing native Australian food, evolving from the older-style \"bush tucker\" which was used in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nTV shows made use of the bush tucker theme. Malcolm Douglas was one of the first presenters to show how to 'live off the land' in the Australian Outback. Major Les Hiddins, a retired Australian Army soldier popularised the idea of bush tucker as an interesting food resource. He presented a hit TV series called \"The Bush Tucker Man\" on the ABC TV network in the late 1980s. In the series, Hiddins demonstrated his research for NORFORCE in identifying foods which might sustain or augment army forces in the northern Australian Outback. 'NORFORCE' is a Regional Force Surveillance Unit of the Australian Army Reserve.\n\nIn early 2003, the first cooking show featuring authentic Australian foods and called \"Dining Downunder\" was produced by Vic Cherikoff and Bailey Park Productions of Toronto, Canada. This was followed by the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) production of Message Stick with Aboriginal chef, Mark Olive.\n\nRay Mears recently made a survival television series called \"Ray Mears Goes Walkabout\" which focused on the history of survival in Australia, with a focus on bush tucker. In the series, Les Hiddins was a guest in one episode, with the two men sharing their knowledge and discussing various aspects of bush tucker.\n\nIn the TV survival series \"Survivorman\" host and narrator, Les Stroud, spent time in the Australian outback. After successfully finding and eating a witchetty grub raw he found many more and cooked them, stating they were much better cooked.

{"id": "55642792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55642792", "title": "Clausula (rhetoric)", "text": "Clausula (rhetoric)\n\nIn Roman rhetoric, a clausula /'klɔːzi̯ʊlə/ (Latin \"little close or conclusion\"; plural \"clausulae\" /'klɔːzi̯ʊli/) was a rhythmic figure used to add finesse and finality to the end of a sentence or phrase. There was a large range of popular clausulae. Most well known is the classically Ciceronian \"esse videatur\" type.\n\nEvery long sentence can be divided into rhythmical \"cola\" (singular \"colon\"), in Latin \"membra\" (singular \"membrum\"), and the last few syllables of every colon tend to conform to certain favourite rhythmic patterns, which are known as \"clausulae\". Shorter \"cola\" were known as \"commata\" /ˈkɒmətə/ (singular \"comma\"), in Latin \"incisa\" (singular \"incisum\"), which also often display rhythmic endings.\n\nThe constant use of clausulae in Cicero's speeches was first thoroughly investigated by the Polish philologist Tadeusz Zieliński in a monumental work published in German in 1904, following an earlier dissertation by G. Wüst in 1881 and work by other scholars. Zieliński established that a Ciceronian clausula had two parts: a \"base\", generally a cretic | – u – | or a variation on it, and a \"cadence\", generally of a trochaic rhythm such as | – x |, | – u x |, or | – u – x |. (Here \"–\" indicates a long syllable, \"u\" a short syllable, and \"x\" a syllable which can be either long or short.)\n\nThe most common clausulae in Cicero are the following:\n\nVariations may include resolving one of the long syllables in the rhythm into two short ones, for example | – u uu | – x | (\"esse videatur\") instead of | – u – | – x |. Another type of allowable variation is to substitute | – uu – | or | – u – – | for the base.\n\nThe above clausulae account for about 87% of Cicero's clausulae. Other clausulae are rarer. For example, the cadence may have five elements | – u – u – | or consist of two spondees | – – – – |. This last type (commoner in Livy than in Cicero) is compared by Zieliński to the blows of a hammer. Certain clausulae, such as the hexameter ending | – u u | – x |, were avoided (it occurs in Cicero, but only in about 0.6% of cases, and often for a reason such a mock-heroic description).\n\nZieliński noted that Cicero's preferences changed gradually over the years. For example, the rhythm | – – – | – u x | was more common in his earlier speeches, while from his consulate onwards he preferred the lighter | – u – | – u x |.\n\nAccording to Zieliński, it is a principle of clausulae that the word-accent tends to follow the ictus of the feet, that is, there is usually an accent on the first syllable of the base and on the penultimate long syllable of the cadence, e.g. \"ílla tempéstas\", \"egéstas audácia\", \"incéndium civitátis\", \"Cáesari d(e) eius áctis\", etc. However, there are often exceptions to this rule, and Cicero was not so strict as later writers such as Augustine and Arnobius.\n\nThere is no doubt that the skilful use of clausulae was one of the techniques which an orator used to excite an audience. Cicero writes of one occasion when the use of a certain clausula (a dichoreus or double trochee – u – x) by the orator Carbo the Younger was so effective that the audience all gave a shout.\n\nAn example of Cicero's use of clausulae in a speech is given below, with the two sentences divided into cola:\n\nThe \"heroic clausula\" (– uu – x), which resembles a hexameter ending, is rare but can be used for comic effect, as in the following quotation from \"pro Caelio\":\n\nAs Adams points out, the passage is made even more funny by the pun on \"testes\", which can mean \"testicles\" as well as \"witnesses\".\n\nThe following passage from the 2nd Catilinarian oration shows some of the less commonly used cadences, including the five-syllable | – u – u – | and the \"hammer-blow\" spondaic | – – – – |: \n\nIt is characteristic of the emphatic spondaic ending (– – – –) that in Cicero there is always a word-break between the base and the cadence. With the clausula – u – – x on the other hand, as in \"illa tempestas\", the most usual place for a word-break is after the second syllable.\n\nThe following passage from the \"pro Scauro\" is analysed explicitly by Cicero himself into four \"incisa\" (commata), followed by two \"membra\" (cola), and then a long spondaic period ending in a \"dichoreus\" or double trochee:\n\nCicero comments that the \"incisa\" (commata), because of their shortness, are rather freer in their rhythm, and should be used \"like little daggers\". The rhythmical period (\"numerosa comprehensio\"), he says, is a longer sentence composed of at least two cola, and is more sparingly used. The style which consists of a mixture of commata, cola, and the occasional longer period is particularly effective, he says, in passages arguing a case or refuting one.\n\nClausulae are found not only in Cicero but in many Roman (as well as Greek and medieval) writers, especially in oratory but also in other types of writing. Each writer has their own preferences and \"rhythmic signature\". For example, Livy avoids clausulae which are common in Cicero, such as | – u – | – x |, but frequently ends a sentence with a series of long syllables, for example \"legati Roman(i) occurrērunt\".\n\nThe earliest orator to make extensive use of rhythmic prose in Greek is said to have been the sophist Thrasymachus of Chalcedon (the same person who appears as a speaker in book 1 of Plato's \"Republic\"). Plato himself favoured the clausulae | – u – | – u x |, | – – – | – u x |, and | – u u | – u x |, among others. His preferences changed in the course of his life, and he used | u u u x | and | – u u u – x | more often in the later works. Lysias, Aeschines, Isaeus, Plutarch and others also had their own preferences. Clausulae are prominent in the orations of Demosthenes, especially the ditrochaeus (– u – x), dispondaeus (– – – x), cretic + trochee (– u – – x), and choriamb + trochee (– uu – – x). But his most characteristic practice (known as \"Blass's Law\") is to avoid series of more than three short syllables anywhere in his sentences. Some writers such as Thucydides, wrote prose almost free of rhythmical influence, however.\n\nIn Latin, rhythmical prose was characteristic of the so-called \"Asiatic\" style of oratory, whereas followers of the plainer \"Attic\" style avoided it. The younger Pliny, Seneca, Suetonius, Apuleius and Tertullian more or less followed the Ciceronian pattern, though several writers avoided | – – – | – u x | and the famous \"esse videatur\" clausula, as being overly Ciceronian.\n\nIn the medieval period, Latin ceased to be pronounced in a quantitative way, and clausulae tended to be accentual rather than based on quantity. Three end-of-sentence rhythms were especially favoured, the so called \"planus\" (– x x – x) (where – indicates an accented syllable and x an unaccented one), the \"tardus\" (– x x – x x), and the \"velox\" (– x x x x – x). These rhythms are found for example in the writings of Gregory of Tours (6th century), Bernard of Clairvaux and Héloïse (12th century), and Dante (13th-14th century). They are known to modern scholars (although apparently not to the medieval writers themselves) as \"cursus\". However, not all writers made use of them. The professors of the period specified that the last word of the sentence had to be of either three or four syllables.\n\nThe first writer to mention rhythm in prose is Aristotle in his \"Ars Rhetorica\"; he says that prose should not be entirely metrical, like poetry, but also not unrhythmical either. Cicero himself discusses the use of clausulae in his books on oratory, especially in \"de Oratore\" 173-198, and \"Orator\" 204-226. Terentianus Maurus (c. 290 AD) also discusses clausulae in a work itself written in verse. He says of the cretic (– u –) that it is the best kind of foot, especially when used in penultimate position before a dactyl (– u x). The teacher of rhetoric Quintilian treats clausulae at length, especially in books 5 and 9; like Terentianus, he approves of the double cretic | – u – | – u x |, but recommends avoiding the heroic clausula | – x – | – uu – x |, since it too much resembles the end of a line of verse.\n\nThe analysis of a piece of Latin into cola and clausulae can not only of help the modern student to read the passage with authentic phrasing, but also is a useful tool in investigating an author's style. So, for example, Riggsby notes that the cola in the earlier part of the 2nd Catilinarian oration are shorter, and the clausulae more varied, than in the last paragraph. He takes this as an indication of Cicero's shift in emphasis from chaos and danger to peace and resolution. Often the clausulae will throw light on the writer's choice of word, tense or word order. For example, \"patent portae, proficiscere!\" \"the gates are open; depart!\" makes an effective clausula, whereas *\"portae patent, proficiscere\" does not. Clausulae can also help editors decide which of two manuscript readings is the correct one, or whether an editor's conjecture is acceptable.\n\nClausulae have sometimes helped editors to decide on the authenticity or otherwise of a work. For example, the speech \"de domo sua\", whose authorship was once in doubt, has been shown to exhibit exactly the same proportions of clausulae as Cicero's other speeches. In the case of authors whose practice varied over the years, such as Plato, clausulae analysis can throw light on the date of a work.\n\nFrom examining the clausulae it is sometimes possible to uncover the exact pronunciation of individual words by a particular author. For example, it appears that Cicero pronounced \"redduco\" \"I bring back\" and \"relliquus\" \"remaining\" with a long first syllable, as did Lucretius. \"Nōn modō\" \"not only\" was pronounced with the last vowel long. For ordinary nouns ending in \"-ium\" or \"-ius\", the genitive \"-i\" was preferred by Cicero (e.g. \"iudici\" \"of the trial\"), although in proper names such as \"Clodii\" \"of Clodius\" the ending \"-ii\" was often used. In \"nil\" and \"nihil\" \"nothing\" and \"periculum\" and \"periclum\" \"danger\" both forms occur. In the future perfect tense, as in \"fecerīmus\" \"we'll have made\", it appears that Cicero, contrary to the rule given in some grammars such as Kennedy, pronounced the \"i\" long, as did his contemporary Catullus.\n\n"}

{"id": "50352288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50352288", "title": "Cultural relations", "text": "Cultural relations\n\nCultural relations are reciprocal, non-coercive transnational interactions between two or more cultures, encompassing a range of activities that are conducted both by state and non-state actors within the space of cultural and civil society. The overall outcomes of cultural relations are greater connectivity, better mutual understanding, more and deeper relationships, mutually beneficial transactions and enhanced sustainable dialogue between states, peoples, non-state actors and cultures.\n\nThrough public policy tools such as public diplomacy and cultural diplomacy (state to people relations), strategic communication and conditionality (including policies of mass persuasion and propaganda), countries and state sponsored institutions rely on non-state actors and culture with the aim of promoting and strengthening their foreign policy interests and influencing perceptions and preferences.\n\nCultural relations can be distinguished from state led activities such as public diplomacy; cultural diplomacy and nation branding, in that they do not originate only from policies of state actors; through the range of institutions and non-state actors involved pursuing their own goals as transnational actors and by their reciprocity. They are, however, a tangible component of International Relations in the sense that they encompass the space in which a wide range of non-state actors engage in the fostering of intercultural dialogue which can be either in favour of, or against, the national interests of state actors.\n\nThis definition follows Chrisine Silvester’s concept of critical imaginations (see the book Critical Imaginations in International Relations, 2016) as she argues that traditional International Relations imagines worlds mostly through the linking of concepts or data points, leaving the field with a certain social hollowness at the core of the canon, an emptiness where people, who are going about their lives experiencing and influencing international relations, should be. She argues that much of International Relations lacks the creativity necessary to place itself in the world of people. The concept of cultural relations fills that void. As cultural relations are engaged in the shaping of preferences of others through appeal and attraction, this distinct field fits into Joseph Nye’s popular theoretical concept of soft power (see Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power, 1990) denoting the ability to attract and co-opt rather than coerce (using force or giving money as a means of persuasion).\n\nConsisting of both direct and indirect interactions between cultures, cultural relations do not fit as comfortably into an academic field as state actors do into International Relations, Economics and Politics. Direct cultural interactions denote both physical and virtual encounters with people and objects of another culture. Indirect cultural interactions involve ideas, values and beliefs proper to a specific culture and often featured in philosophy, literature, music, and art that are acting as cross-national tools, which can foster and strengthen intercultural dialogue. An understanding of cultural relations therefore requires an understanding of contemporary cultures, at both the global and local levels. These cultures include the range of activities and practices of those engaged in cultural governance and policy, production, dissemination and economics. This includes the political, economic and social roles of culture in cultural markets, development, institutions and specific contexts.\n\nDue to the increasing pervasiveness of ongoing developments in digital communication and (social) media networks, which greatly facilitate these processes of global cultural production, participation and dialogue, the importance of direct and indirect cultural relations is growing and developing. Digital media enable cultural and civic societies to engage in cultural relations beyond the boundaries of traditional non-hard state power, i.e. cultural and public diplomacy.\n\nCultural relations both produce and diffuse (soft) power, which varies depending on who is engaging with it. First and foremost, cultural relations are conducted through the enormous range of non-state actors engaged transnationally. The range includes cities, global civil society, educational institutions, cultural and arts organisations, research institutes, corporations and businesses, even down to individuals who can engage via the Internet. This does not mean, however, that state actors are excluded from the field of cultural relations. There is necessarily an ongoing interaction between the field of cultural relations and a state’s foreign policy, given the scale and importance of cultural relations activity, which dwarfs state driven policies in quantity, frequency, inclusiveness and speed. These characteristics of scale, the prominence of the digital, the range from formal to informal actors, generate a need for new forms of evidence, descriptions and theorisation.\n\nSoft power – public diplomacy – cultural diplomacy – International Relations\n\n"}
{"id": "2725360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2725360", "title": "Deconstruction (building)", "text": "Deconstruction (building)\n\nIn the context of physical construction, deconstruction is the selective dismantlement of building components, specifically for re-use, repurposing, recycling, and waste management. It differs from demolition where a site is cleared of its building by the most expedient means. Deconstruction has also been defined as “construction in reverse”. The process of dismantling structures is an ancient activity that has been revived by the growing field of sustainable, green method of building. Buildings, like everything, have a life-cycle. Deconstruction focuses on giving the materials within a building a new life once the building as a whole can no longer continue.\n\nWhen buildings reach the end of their useful life, they are typically demolished and hauled to landfills. Building implosions or ‘wrecking-ball’ style demolitions are relatively inexpensive and offer a quick method of clearing sites for new structures. On the other hand, these methods create substantial amounts of waste. Components within old buildings may still be valuable, sometimes more valuable than at the time the building was constructed. Deconstruction is a method of harvesting what is commonly considered “waste” and reclaiming it into useful building material.\n\nDeconstruction has strong ties to environmental sustainability. In addition to giving materials a new life cycle, deconstructing buildings helps to lower the need for virgin resources. This in turn leads to energy and emissions reductions from the refining and manufacture of new materials. As deconstruction is often done on a local level, many times on-site, energy and emissions are also saved in the transportation of materials. Deconstruction can potentially support communities by providing local jobs and renovated structures. Deconstruction work typically employs 3-6 workers for every one employed in a comparable demolition job. In addition, solid waste from conventional demolition is diverted from landfills. This is a major benefit because construction and demolition waste accounts for approximately 20% of the solid waste stream.\n\nIn Canada, the CO2 Neutral Alliance has created a website with resources for regulators and municipalities, developers and contractors, business owners and operators, and individuals and households. Benefits for municipalities include:\nImproving the local environment and overall sustainability of your community \nFor every three square feet of deconstruction, enough lumber can be salvaged to build one square foot of new construction. At this rate, if deconstruction replaced residential demolition, the United States could generate enough recovered wood to construct 120,000 new affordable homes each year. The deconstruction of a typical wood frame home can yield 6,000 board feet of reusable lumber. \nEvery year the United States buries about 33 million tons of wood-related construction and demolition debris in landfills. As anaerobic microorganisms decompose this wood, it will release about five million tons of carbon equivalent in the form of methane gas.\n\nDeconstruction is commonly separated into two categories; structural and non-structural. Non-structural deconstruction, also known as “soft-stripping”, consists of reclaiming non-structural components, appliances, doors, windows, and finish materials. The reuse of these types of materials is commonplace and considered to be a mature market in many locales.\n\nStructural deconstruction involves dismantling the structural components of a building. Traditionally this had only been performed to reclaim expensive or rare materials such as used brick, dimension stone, and extinct wood. In antiquity, it was common to raze stone buildings and reuse the stone; it was also common to steal stones from a building that was not being totally demolished: this is the literal meaning of the word \"dilapidated.\" Used brick and dimension limestone in particular have a long tradition of reuse due to their durability and color changes over time. Recently, the rise of environmental awareness and sustainable building has made a much wider range of materials worthy of structural deconstruction. Low-end, commonplace materials such as dimensional lumber have become part of this newly emerging market.\n\nThe United States military has utilized structural deconstruction in many of its bases. The construction methods of barracks, among other base structures, are usually relatively simple. They typically contained large amounts of lumber and used minimal adhesives and finish-work. In addition, the buildings are often identical, making the process of deconstructing multiple buildings much easier. Many barracks were built during the era prior to WWII, and have aged to the point where they now need to be torn down. Deconstruction was deemed very practical due to the abundance of labor the military has access to and the value of the materials themselves.\n\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, and earthquakes often leave a vast amount of usable building materials in their wake. Structures that remain standing are often deconstructed to provide materials for rebuilding the region.\n\nDeconstruction’s economic viability varies from project to project. The amount of time and cost of labor are the main drawbacks. Harvesting materials from a structure can take weeks, whereas demolition may be completed in roughly a day. However, some of the costs, if not all, can be recovered. Reusing the materials in a new on-site structure, selling reclaimed materials, donating materials for income tax write-offs, and avoiding landfill “tipping fees” are all ways in which the cost of deconstruction can be made comparable to demolition.\n\nReclaiming the materials for a new on-site structure is the most economically and environmentally efficient option. Tipping fees and the costs of new materials are avoided; in addition, the transportation of the materials is non-existent. Selling the used materials or donating them to non-profit organizations are another effective way of gaining capital. Donations to NPO’s such as Habitat for Humanity’s ReStore are tax deductible. Many times it is possible to claim the value to be half of what that particular material would cost new. When donating rare or antique components it is sometimes possible to claim a higher value than a comparable, brand-new material.\n\nValue can also be added to new structures that are built by implementing reused materials. The United States Green Building Council's program entitled Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) offers seven credits relating to reusing materials. (This accounts for seven out of a maximum sixty-nine credits) These include credits for building-shell reuse, material reuse, and diverting waste from landfills. Building shell-reuse is particularly appropriate for shells made of dimension stone.\n\nDeconstruction is well suited to job training for the construction trades. Taking down a building is an excellent way for a worker to learn how to put a building up. This is vital for the economic recovery of inner-city communities. Unskilled and low-skilled workers can receive on-the-job training in use of basic carpentry tools and techniques, as well as learning teamwork, problem-solving, critical thinking and good work habits.\n\nWhen choosing to deconstruct a building there are some important aspects that need to be taken into consideration. Developing a list of local contacts that are able to take used materials is an essential first step. These might include commercial architectural salvage businesses, reclamation yards, not-for-profit and social enterprise salvage warehouses, and dismantling contractors. Materials that cannot be salvaged may be recycled on-site or off-site, or taken to landfills. The next step involves identifying which, if any, are hazardous materials. Lead paint and asbestos are two substances in particular that need to be handled extremely cautiously and disposed of properly.\n\nIt is common practice, and common sense, to “soft-strip” the structure first; remove all appliances, windows, doors, and other finishing materials. These will account for a large percentage of the marketable components. After the non-structural deconstruction, structural is the next step. It is best to start at the roof and work down to the foundation.\n\nBuilding components that are dismantled will need to be stored in a secure, dry location. This will protect them from water damage and theft. Once separated from the structure, materials can also be cleaned and/or refinished to increase value. Building an inventory list of the materials at hand will help determine where each item will be sent.\n\n\"The end of the building’s useful life generates a stream of used materials that can be reprocessed for new construction. The selection of materials for reuse or recycling should not start at the end of the building’s life cycle, it should start at the design stage. Architects and engineers should keep the whole life cycle of the building in mind and select construction materials based on their capacity to be reused or recycled after the building has served its purpose.\"\n\nAn upstream approach to deconstruction can be implemented into buildings during their design process. This is a current trend in sustainable architecture. Often, simple construction methods combined with high-grade, durable materials work best for DfD structures. Separating layers of a building’s infrastructure and making them visible can significantly simplify its deconstruction. Making components within systems separable also assists in being able to dismantle materials quickly and efficiently. This can be achieved by using mechanical fasteners such as bolts to connect parts. Allowing physical access to the fasteners is another needed aspect of this design. Also, it is important to use standardized materials and assemble them in a consistent manner throughout the project.\n\nSome conventional construction methods and materials are difficult or impossible to deconstruct and should be avoided when designing for deconstruction. The use of nails and adhesives significantly slows down the deconstruction process and has a tendency to ruin otherwise reusable materials. Avoid hazardous materials altogether as they are detrimental to the natural environment and are non-reusable. Using mixed material grades makes the process of identifying pieces for resale difficult.\n\nDeconstruction is important for more than just the end of a building’s life-cycle. Buildings that have been designed with deconstruction in mind are often easier to maintain and adapt to new uses. Saving the shell of a building or adapting interior spaces to meet new needs ensures that new structures have a small environmental impact.\n\nAn alternative worth considering is modular building, like the Habitat 67 project in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. This was a residential structure consisting of separate, functional apartments that could be put together in a variety of ways. As people moved in or out, the units could be reconfigured as desired.\n\n\n"}

The film was animated by the French animation studio Mac Guff, which was later acquired by Illumination. Directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud in their directorial debuts with a story by Sergio Pablos, the title references the main character as he refers to himself and is accompanied by a song by Pharrell Williams. \n\nThe film stars Steve Carell, the voice of Gru, a supervillain who adopts three girls (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher) from an orphanage; and the voice of Jason Segel as Vector, a rival of Gru who steals the Great Pyramid of Giza. When Gru learns of Vector's heist, he plans an even greater heist: to shrink and steal the Earth's moon. However, despite Gru's villainous intentions, he grows increasingly touched by the girls' growing love for him and find himself changing for the better because of it.\n\nReleased theatrically on July 9, 2010 in the United States, \"Despicable Me\" grossed over $546 million worldwide against a budget of $69 million. It launched the \"Despicable Me\" franchise series of films, including the sequel \"Despicable Me 2\" in 2013, another sequel, \"Despicable Me 3\" in 2017, and the prequel, \"Minions,\" released in 2015, which featured Gru's Minions as the main characters.\n\nA supervillain named Gru has his pride injured when an unknown villain steals the Great Pyramid of Giza. With the assistance of his sidekick Dr. Nefario and his Minions, Gru resolves to one-up his mysterious rival by shrinking and stealing the Moon. Knowing this is extremely costly, Gru seeks a loan from the Bank of Evil. Mr. Perkins - the bank president - is impressed by the plan, but he will approve the loan only if Gru can obtain the necessary shrink ray first. Upon learning that an up-and-coming villain known as Vector was responsible for the Pyramid theft, Gru starts a rivalry with him.\n\nGru and the Minions steal the shrink ray from a secret base in East Asia, but Vector intercepts them and steals it for himself. Gru attempts to break into Vector's impregnable fortress to recover the shrink ray, only to be defeated by numerous kinds of traps. As nothing seems to work, he notices three orphan girls, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, who are able to easily enter the base because they are selling cookies. Gru disguises himself and adopts the girls, planning to use them to infiltrate Vector's base. However, Gru has trouble nurturing them properly due to their stubbornness, their ballet classes and his own ineptitude as a parent.\n\nEventually, Gru and the girls arrive at Vector's base, and Gru successfully steals the shrink ray. The girls then suggest a day at a theme park. Gru agrees, believing he can abandon the girls there, but instead he has fun with them. Later, Gru contacts Perkins via video chat, stating that he finally has the shrink ray. Margo, Edith, and Agnes interrupt the meeting, and Perkins announces that he has lost confidence in Gru and will no longer fund his operations. As Gru tells the Minions he can no longer pay them for their services, the girls offer the contents of their piggy bank. Inspired, Gru sells parts of his lair and the items he stole over the years to construct a spacecraft. Gru plans to steal the Moon when it is nearest to the Earth, but this is ironically the same day as the girls' ballet recital. As Gru becomes puzzled, Dr. Nefario arranges for the girls to be returned to the orphanage, thinking the recital may ruin the plan. At the same time, Perkins informs his son - Vector - of Gru's possession of the shrink ray and the adoption of the three girls, encouraging Vector to take action.\n\nGru successfully shrinks and steals the Moon. He rushes back to Earth to attend the recital, only to find a ransom note from Vector, who has kidnapped the girls. After arriving at Vector's base, Gru surrenders the Moon. However, Vector reneges on the deal, flying off with the girls and the Moon. Meanwhile, Dr. Nefario has discovered that the effects of the shrink ray are temporary. The bigger the object is, the faster it recovers its original size. Gru, Dr. Nefario, and the Minions execute a daring mid-air rescue of the girls, just before the Moon explodes Vector's spaceship and launches itself back into orbit, along with Vector on it.\n\nSometime later, Gru has returned the Great Pyramid and re-adopted the girls, writing them a bedtime storybook based on his own experience. The film ends with the girls performing their ballet recital for Gru, his mother Marlena, Dr. Nefario, and the Minions.\n\n\n\"Despicable Me\" was initially developed by Sergio Pablos under the original title \"Evil Me\". He later participated in development during the early stages of the production and took the package unsolicited to Universal Pictures where he became the first of several screenwriters on the project as well as executive producer. In November 2008, Illumination Entertainment announced the beginning of the development on its first CGI animated film \"Despicable Me\".\n\n\"Despicable Me: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\" is the soundtrack to the film of the same name, and it was released on July 6, 2010. It featured new songs from the film written and performed by Pharrell Williams, and performances by Destinee & Paris, The Sylvers, Robin Thicke and the Bee Gees.\n\nNBC (which is owned by Universal) had an extensive marketing campaign leading up to the film's release. Sneak peeks were shown in episodes of \"The Biggest Loser\". \"Despicable Me\" was also featured on \"Last Comic Standing\" when Gru comes in to audition. IHOP restaurants promoted the film by introducing three new menu items, a kids' breakfast meal, and a drink all having the word \"minion\" in them. Best Buy released a free smartphone application called \"Best Buy Movie Mode\", which translated what the Minions were saying during the end credits of the 3D theatrical release. For the home media release of the film, the application was updated to translate the Minions' language throughout the entire film.\n\nIn May 2010, three books related to the movie were published, as well as the children's puppet book featured in the film.

A dual quaternion can be represented in the form , where \"p\" and \"q\" are ordinary quaternions and ε is the dual unit (which satisfies ) and commutes with every element of the algebra. Unlike quaternions, they do not form a division ring.\n\nIn mechanics, the dual quaternions are applied as a number system to represent rigid transformations in three dimensions. A dual quaternion is an ordered pair of quaternions , constructed from eight real parameters. Because rigid transformations have six real degrees of freedom, dual quaternions include two algebraic constraints for this application.\n\nSimilar to the way that rotations in 3D space can be represented by quaternions of unit length, rigid motions in 3D space can be represented by dual quaternions of unit length. This fact is used in theoretical kinematics (see McCarthy), and in applications to 3D computer graphics, robotics and computer vision.\n\nW. R. Hamilton introduced quaternions in 1843, and by 1873 W. K. Clifford obtained a broad generalization of these numbers that he called \"biquaternions\", which is an example of what is now called a Clifford algebra.\n\nIn 1898 Alexander McAulay used Ω with Ω = 0 to generate the dual quaternion algebra. However, his terminology of \"octonions\" did not stick as today's octonions are another algebra.\n\nIn Russia, Aleksandr Kotelnikov developed dual vectors and dual quaternions for use in the study of mechanics.\n\nIn 1891 Eduard Study realized that this associative algebra was ideal for describing the group of motions of three-dimensional space. He further developed the idea in \"Geometrie der Dynamen\" in 1901. \nB. L. van der Waerden called the structure \"Study biquaternions\", one of three eight-dimensional algebras referred to as biquaternions.\n\nIn order to describe operations with dual quaternions, it is helpful to first consider quaternions.\n\nA quaternion is a linear combination of the basis elements 1, \"i\", \"j\", and \"k\". Hamilton's product rule for \"i\", \"j\", and \"k\" is often written as\nCompute , to obtain , and or . Now because , we see that this product yields , which links quaternions to the properties of determinants.\n\nA convenient way to work with the quaternion product is to write a quaternion as the sum of a scalar and a vector, that is , where \"a\" is a real number and is a three dimensional vector. The vector dot and cross operations can now be used to define the quaternion product of and as\n\nA dual quaternion is usually described as a quaternion with dual numbers as coefficients. A dual number is an ordered pair . Two dual numbers add componentwise and multiply by the rule . Dual numbers are often written in the form , where ε is the dual unit that commutes with \"i\", \"j\", \"k\" and has the property .\n\nThe result is that a dual quaternion is the ordered pair of quaternions . Two dual quaternions add componentwise and multiply by the rule,\n\nIt is convenient to write a dual quaternion as the sum of a dual scalar and a dual vector, , where and is the dual vector that defines a screw. This notation allows us to write the product of two dual quaternions as\n\nThe addition of dual quaternions is defined componentwise so that given, \n\nand\nthen\n\nMultiplication of two dual quaternion follows from the multiplication rules for the quaternion units i, j, k and commutative multiplication by the dual unit ε. In particular, given\n\nand\nthen\n\nNotice that there is no \"BD\" term, because the definition of dual numbers requires that .\n\nThis gives us the multiplication table (note the multiplication order is row times column):\n\nThe conjugate of a dual quaternion is the extension of the conjugate of a quaternion, that is\n\nAs with quaternions, the conjugate of the product of dual quaternions, , is the product of their conjugates in reverse order,\n\nIt is useful to introduce the functions Sc(∗) and Vec(∗) that select the scalar and vector parts of a quaternion, or the dual scalar and dual vector parts of a dual quaternion. In particular, if , then\nThis allows the definition of the conjugate of \"Â\" as\nor, \n\nThe product of a dual quaternion with its conjugate yields\nThis is a dual scalar which is the \"magnitude squared\" of the dual quaternion.\n\nA second type of conjugate of a dual quaternion is given by taking the dual number conjugate, given by\n\nThe quaternion and dual number conjugates can be combined into a third form of conjugate given by\n\nIn the context of dual quaternions, the term \"conjugate\" can be used to mean the quaternion conjugate, dual number conjugate, or both.\n\nThe \"norm\" of a dual quaternion is computed using the conjugate to compute . This is a dual number called the \"magnitude\" of the dual quaternion. Dual quaternions with are \"unit dual quaternions\".\n\nDual quaternions of magnitude 1 are used to represent spatial Euclidean displacements. Notice that the requirement that 1, introduces two algebraic constraints on the components of \"Â\", that is\n\nIf is a dual quaternion, and \"p\" is not zero, then the inverse dual quaternion is given by \nThus the elements of the subspace do not have inverses. This subspace is called an ideal in ring theory. It happens to be the unique maximal ideal of the ring of dual numbers.\n\nThe group of units of the dual number ring then consists of numbers not in the ideal. The dual numbers form a local ring since there is a unique maximal ideal. The group of units is a Lie group and can be studied using the exponential mapping. Dual quaternions have been used to exhibit transformations in the Euclidean group. A typical element can be written as a screw transformation.\n\nA benefit of the dual quaternion formulation of the composition of two spatial displacements D=([R], b) and D=([R],a) is that the resulting dual quaternion yields directly the screw axis and dual angle of the composite displacement D=DD.\n\nIn general, the dual quaternion associated with a spatial displacement D = ([A],d) is constructed from its screw axis S=(S, V) and the dual angle (φ, d) where φ is the rotation about and d the slide along this axis, which defines the displacement D. The associated dual quaternion is given by,\n\nLet the composition of the displacement D with D be the displacement D=DD. The screw axis and dual angle of D is obtained from the product of the dual quaternions of D and D, given by\nThat is, the composite displacement D=DD has the associated dual quaternion given by\n\nExpand this product in order to obtain\n\nDivide both sides of this equation by the identity\nto obtain\n\nThis is Rodrigues' formula for the screw axis of a composite displacement defined in terms of the screw axes of the two displacements. He derived this formula in 1840.\n\nThe three screw axes A, B, and C form a spatial triangle and the dual angles at these \"vertices\" between the common normals that form the sides of this triangle are directly related to the dual angles of the three spatial displacements.\n\nThe matrix representation of the quaternion product is convenient for programming quaternion computations using matrix algebra, which is true for dual quaternion operations as well.\n\nThe quaternion product AC is a linear transformation by the operator A of the components of the quaternion C, therefore there is a matrix representation of A operating on the vector formed from the components of C.\n\nAssemble the components of the quaternion into the array . Notice that the components of the vector part of the quaternion are listed first and the scalar is listed last. This is an arbitrary choice, but once this convention is selected we must abide by it.\n\nThe quaternion product AC can now be represented as the matrix product\n\nThe product AC can also be viewed as an operation by C on the components of A, in which case we have\n\nThe dual quaternion product ÂĈ = (A, B)(C, D) = (AC, AD+BC) can be formulated as a matrix operation as follows. Assemble the components of Ĉ into the eight dimensional array Ĉ = (C, C, C, c, D, D, D, d), then ÂĈ is given by the 8x8 matrix product\n\nAs we saw for quaternions, the product ÂĈ can be viewed as the operation of Ĉ on the coordinate vector Â, which means ÂĈ can also be formulated as,\n\nThe dual quaternion of a displacement D=([A], d) can be constructed from the quaternion S=cos(φ/2) + sin(φ/2)S that defines the rotation [A] and the vector quaternion constructed from the translation vector d, given by D = di + dj + dk. Using this notation, the dual quaternion for the displacement D=([A], d) is given by\n\nLet the Plücker coordinates of a line in the direction x through a point p in a moving body and its coordinates in the fixed frame which is in the direction X through the point P be given by,\nThen the dual quaternion of the displacement of this body transforms Plücker coordinates in the moving frame to Plücker coordinates in the fixed frame by the formula\n\nUsing the matrix form of the dual quaternion product this becomes,\nThis calculation is easily managed using matrix operations.\n\nIt might be helpful, especially in rigid body motion, to represent dual quaternions as homogeneous matrices. As given above a dual quaternion can be written as: formula_34 where \"r\" and \"d\" are both quaternions. The \"r\" quaternion is known as the real or rotational part and the formula_35 quaternion is known as the dual or displacement part. \n\nThe rotation part can be given by\n\nwhere formula_37 is the angle of rotation about the direction given by unit vector formula_38. The displacement part can be written as \n\nThe dual-quaternion equivalent of a 3D-vector is\n\nand its transformation by formula_41 is given by\n\nThese dual quaternions (or actually their transformations on 3D-vectors) can be represented by the homogeneous transformation matrix\nwhere the 3×3 orthogonal matrix is given by\n\nFor the 3D-vector\n\nthe transformation by T is given by\n\nSince both Eduard Study and William Kingdon Clifford used and wrote about dual quaternions, at times authors refer to dual quaternions as \"Study biquaternions\" or \"Clifford biquaternions\". The latter eponym has also been used to refer to split-biquaternions. Read the article by Joe Rooney linked below for view of a supporter of W.K. Clifford’s claim. Since the claims of Clifford and Study are in contention, it is convenient to use the current designation \"dual quaternion\" to avoid conflict.\n\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n\n"}

In 1834 he opened his own perfumery, the House of Rimmel. In the same year father and son produced their first cosmetic products. By the age of 24, Eugène Rimmel had become an immensely talented perfumer and cosmetics innovator.

He was also among the first to develop scented pomades, mouth rinses and his signature \"Toilet Vinegar\".\n\nHis most innovative invention may well be the first commercial non-toxic mascara, which became so popular that \"rimmel\" is to this day the word for \"mascara\" in several languages including French, Italian, Portuguese, Persian, Romanian, Spanish, Turkish and Arabic.\n\nRimmel was also considered an exceptional marketer and produced detailed mail order catalogues and advertising programmes with English theatres.\n\nIn 1865 he published \"The Book of Perfume\", which appeared in 1870 in a French translation (\"Le Livre des Parfums\") with a preface by Alphonse Karr.\n\nRimmel was so successful that he was granted ten Royal Warrants from heads of state all over Europe, including Queen Victoria, for his perfumes and fragranced products.\n\nWith the headline \"The Prince of Perfumers\", \"The New York Times\" printed Rimmel's obituary on 15 March 1887.

Since 2001 it has been included in a State Natural Reserve of the same name. It is often marketed to tourists in the region as the \"Grand Canyon of Italy.\"\n\nThe Roman emperor Vespasian had a tunnel built here to facilitate passage on the Via Flaminia at the narrowest point of the gorge (hence the name, from the Latina \"forulum\", meaning \"small hole\"). Next to it is a similar but smaller tunnel dating from Etruscan times. The tunnel has a length of 38.30 meters and a height of 5.95 meters. During the Gothic Wars (6th century), the Ostrogoth King Totila had the pass fortified, but his troops were ousted by the Roman general Belisarius. The Lombards conquered the pass between 570 and 578, and destroyed the fortifications.\n\nIn the following centuries Via Flaminia was nearly abandoned. In 1502 Lucrezia Borgia used it on a journey to Ferrara and in 1506 Julius II took the road on his way to Bologna. In the beginning of the 18th century the transit remained difficult and dangerous, and only in 1776 was the tunnel and the road re-opened.

{"id": "35203202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35203202", "title": "Great Tew Circle", "text": "Great Tew Circle\n\nThe Great Tew Circle was a group of clerics and literary figures who gathered in the 1630s at the manor house of Great Tew, Oxfordshire in southern England, and in London. Lord Clarendon referred to the Circle as \"A college situate in a purer air\", referring to its pursuit of truth away from the partisan passions of the town. The quote is referenced by John Buchan in his story \"Fullcircle\", though he misquotes it as \"clearer air\". The house was the property of the noble Cary family, and the circle was brought together by Lucius Cary, who became 2nd Viscount Falkland on the death of his father in 1633. The most prominent of those taking part was Edward Hyde, the future 1st Earl of Clarendon, who after 1660 would become known as a leading statesman, and then a historian.\n\nIn the vexed religious climate of the time, the Circle was heterodox, inclining to sympathy with Socinianism. The favoured approach of some of those involved has been defined as \"Arminian humanism\", and in any case opposed to rigid Calvinism; this approach fitted with political views that were essentially royalist. The central religious figure of the Circle was William Chillingworth. Falkland himself had a Catholic convert, Elizabeth Cary, Lady Falkland, for his mother, and found the tolerant approach of Erasmus attractive.\n\nMajor influences on the thinking of the circle were Hugo Grotius and Richard Hooker because of the place the latter made for the use of reason in Biblical interpretation and church polity. These writers formed part of the broader Christian humanist tradition of Jacobus Acontius, George Cassander, Sebastian Castellio, Bernardino Ochino and Faustus Socinus. The anti-patristic views of Jean Daillé were also significant. According to the writings of Hyde (as Lord Clarendon), the gatherings and discussions themselves were modelled on those of Cicero and Erasmus, with guests being welcome to differ on points of view. Discourse also took place around the dinner table, with Clarendon likening the \"\"Convivium Philosophicum\" or \"Convivium Theologicum\" (\"philosophical-\" or \"theological feast\") to Erasmus's \"Convivium Religiosum\" (\"godly feast\").\"\n\nChillingworth was influenced by Acontius, and the Circle read Acontius alongside Johannes Crellius, a Socinian. They found greater relevance in the eirenicism of Acontius than in the theology (Unitarianism) of Socinus himself. The context, as explained by the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, was that of the Thirty Years' War with its Protestant defeats of the 1620s and Catholic expansion; but also of the doctrines of the contra-Remonstrants in an environment of increasing skepticism on religious matters. Falkland and Chillingworth had been seared by the \"Pyrrhonian crisis\" of skepticism rampant. Opposed to fideism, the Circle found in the use by Grotius of probabilism a more attractive option to deal with the challenge of skepticism.\n\nTrevor-Roper supported the claims of the Great Tew group to the eirenic moral high ground on religious toleration and a commitment to rational dialogue on religion. This analysis has been challenged from the direction of the Circle's political thought, with its commitment to sovereignty. It has also been argued that these are two sides to the understanding of the period of the term \"Socinian\". The eirenic style was understood by Puritan opponents as Arminian rhetoric, and they moved away from compromise with it, to polemic and contemplation of war.\n\nThe major theologians of the circle (Chillingworth, Hales, Taylor) have regularly been claimed as precursors of the Latitudinarians, a term anachronistic before 1660. They are now considered to have paved the way for the Cambridge Platonists, in the attitude that there is no single basis of essential and true beliefs. The distinction now usual between the Cambridge Platonists and other Latitudinarians is a conventional one, introduced by John Tulloch in the 19th century.\n\nParticipation in any actual dialogues as described by Hyde is problematic to establish; and the time scale has different points on it, though a beginning date of 1634 (Martinich) seems to be agreed widely. After about 1640 the troubled political situation overshadowed theoretical discussion and writing. The influence of the circle can be traced in theological production (especially Chillingworth's \"Religion of Protestants\", 1638), literary works and translation in a humanist vein, and the political line pursued by Falkland and Hyde in 1640–1, attempting to find a middle position between Puritan and Laudian extremes.\n\nAmong those mentioned as being in Falkland's circle are:\n\n\n\n\nSince Great Tew was best known as an open house for Oxford scholars, and Falkland's contacts included a group centred on London and the court, it is artificial at best to assign membership in the circle to some who are known to have associated with the group.\n\n\nFalkland himself is identified as one of the Tribe of Ben, the followers of Jonson; and others of the Circle were also in the Tribe. Falkland also gave the first of the poetical tributes in the 1638 Oxford memorial volume \"Jonson Virbius\", and others of the Circle who contributed were Henry Coventry, May and Digges.\n\nHales and Chillingworth have been identified with an \"Oxford School of rational theology\", containing also Christopher Potter and William Page. It has been said that, despite the political difference over the defence of episcopacy, there is no clear distinction between the Great Tew line and Laudianism in theology. Falkland, Hyde and Sir John Colepepper were leaders of the \"Country Alliance\" of 1640.\n\nKatherine Jones was someone common to the Great Tew Circle and the Hartlib Circle. Robert Payne was a central figure in the so-called Welbeck Academy, around the Cavendishes, with which Hobbes was more closely associated than with Great Tew.\n\nThe widowed Lady Falkland (Letice or Lettice) took in John Duncon, brother of Eleazar Duncon and Edmund Duncon, who had lost his Essex rectory during the Civil war. He later wrote her biography (1648, in the form of an exchange of letters). It has been suggested that the household was run on lines similar to that at Little Gidding.\n\n"}
{"id": "13972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13972", "title": "Hungarian language", "text": "Hungarian language\n\nHungarian () is a Finno-Ugric language spoken in Hungary and several neighbouring countries. It is the official language of Hungary and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. Outside Hungary it is also spoken by communities of Hungarians in the countries that today make up Slovakia, western Ukraine (Subcarpathia), central and western Romania (Transylvania), northern Serbia (Vojvodina), northern Croatia, and northern Slovenia (Mur region). It is also spoken by Hungarian diaspora communities worldwide, especially in North America (particularly the United States and Canada) and in Israel. Like Finnish and Estonian, Hungarian belongs to the Uralic language family.\n\nHungarian is a member of the Uralic language family. Linguistic connections between Hungarian and other Uralic languages were noticed in the 1670s, and the family itself (then called Finno-Ugric) was established in 1717, but the classification of Hungarian as a Uralic/Finno-Ugric rather than Turkic language continued to be a matter of impassioned political controversy throughout the 18th and into the 19th centuries. Hungarian has traditionally been assigned to an Ugric branch within Uralic/Finno-Ugric, along with the Mansi and Khanty languages of western Siberia (Khanty–Mansia region), but it is no longer clear that it is a valid group. When the Samoyed languages were determined to be part of the family, it was thought at first that Finnic and Ugric (Finno-Ugric) were closer to each other than to the Samoyed branch of the family, but that now is frequently questioned.\n\nThe name of Hungary could be a result of regular sound changes of \"Ungrian/Ugrian\", and the fact that the Eastern Slavs referred to Hungarians as \"Ǫgry/Ǫgrove\" (sg. \"Ǫgrinŭ\") seemed to confirm that. Current literature favors the hypothesis that it comes from the name of the Turkic tribe Onogur (which means \"ten arrows\" or \"ten tribes\").\n\nThere are numerous regular sound correspondences between Hungarian and the other Ugric languages. For example, Hungarian corresponds to Khanty in certain positions, and Hungarian corresponds to Khanty , while Hungarian final corresponds to Khanty final . For example, Hungarian \"ház\" \"house\" vs. Khanty \"xot\" \"house\", and Hungarian \"száz\" \"hundred\" vs. Khanty \"sot\" \"hundred\". The distance between the Ugric and Finnic languages is greater, but the correspondences are also regular.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 19th century, a competing hypothesis proposed a Turkic affinity of Hungarian. Following an academic debate known as \"Az ugor-török háború\" (\"the Ugric-Turkic battle\"), the Finno-Ugric hypothesis was concluded the sounder of the two, foremost based on work by the German linguist .\n\nThe traditional view holds that the Hungarian language diverged from its Ugric relatives in the first half of the 1st millennium, in western Siberia east of the southern Urals. The Hungarians gradually changed their lifestyle from being settled hunters to being nomadic pastoralists, probably as a result of early contacts with Iranian nomads (Scythians and Sarmatians). In Hungarian, Iranian loanwords date back to the time immediately following the breakup of Ugric and probably span well over a millennium. Among these include \"tehén\" ‘cow’ (cf. Avestan \"dhaénu\"); \"tíz\" ‘ten’ (cf. Avestan \"dasa\"); \"tej\" ‘milk’ (cf. Persian \"dáje\" ‘wet nurse’); and \"nád\" ‘reed’ (from late Middle Iranian; cf. Middle Persian \"nāy\").\n\nArchaeological evidence from present day southern Bashkortostan confirms the existence of Hungarian settlements between the Volga River and Ural Mountains. \nThe Onogurs (and Bulgars) later had a great influence on the language, especially between the 5th and 9th centuries. This layer of Turkic loans is large and varied (\"e.g.\", \"szó\" ‘word’, from Turkic; \"daru\" ‘crane’, from the related Permic languages), and includes words borrowed from Oghur Turkic; \"e.g.\", \"borjú\" ‘calf’ (cf. Chuvash \"păru\", \"părăv\" vs. Turkish \"buzağı\"); \"dél\" ‘noon; south’ (cf. Chuvash \"tĕl\" vs. Turkish dial. \"düš\"). Many words related to agriculture, state administration and even family relationships show evidence of such backgrounds. Hungarian syntax and grammar were not influenced in a similarly dramatic way over these three centuries.\n\nAfter the arrival of the Hungarians in the Carpathian Basin, the language came into contact with a variety of speech communities, among them Slavic, Turkic, and German. Turkic loans from this period come mainly from the Pechenegs and Cumanians, who settled in Hungary during the 12th and 13th centuries; \"e.g.\", \"koboz\" ‘cobza’ (cf. Turkish \"kopuz\" ‘lute’); \"komondor\" ‘mop dog’ (< *\"kumandur\" < \"Cuman\"). Hungarian borrowed many words from neighbouring Slavic languages; \"e.g.\", \"tégla\" ‘brick’; \"mák\" ‘poppy’; \"karácsony\" ‘Christmas’). These languages in turn borrowed words from Hungarian; \"e.g.\", Serbo-Croatian \"ašov\" from Hung \"ásó\" ‘spade’. Approximately 1.6 percent of the Romanian lexicon is of Hungarian origin.\n\nHungarian historian and archaeologist Gyula László claims that geological data from pollen analysis seems to contradict the placing of the ancient Hungarian homeland near the Urals.\n\nThere have been attempts, dismissed by mainstream linguists as pseudoscientific comparisons, to show that Hungarian is related to other languages, such as Hebrew, Hunnic, Sumerian, Egyptian, Etruscan, Basque, Persian, Pelasgian, Greek, Chinese, Sanskrit, English, Tibetan, Magar, Quechua, Armenian, Japanese, and at least 40 other languages.\n\nToday the consensus among linguists is that Hungarian is a member of the Uralic family of languages.\n\nFor many years, however, it was a matter of dispute whether Hungarian was a Finno-Ugric/Uralic language or more closely related to the Turkic languages (a controversy known as the \"Ugric–Turkish war\")—or whether indeed both the Uralic and the Turkic families formed part of a superfamily of Ural–Altaic languages. Hungarians did in fact absorb some Turkic influences during several centuries of cohabitation. For example, the Hungarians appear to have learned animal husbandry techniques from the Turkic Chuvash people, as a high proportion of words specific to agriculture and livestock are of Chuvash origin. A strong Chuvash influence was also apparent in Hungarian burial customs. Furthermore, all Ugric languages, not only Hungarian, feature Turkic loanwords related to horse riding.\n\nThe first written accounts of Hungarian, mostly personal name and place names, date to the 10th century. No significant texts written in Old Hungarian script have survived, as wood, the medium of writing in use at the time, was perishable.\n\nThe Kingdom of Hungary was founded in 1000 by Stephen I. The country became a Western-styled Christian (Roman Catholic) state, with Latin script replacing Hungarian runes. The earliest remaining fragments of the language are found in the establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany from 1055, intermingled with Latin text. The first extant text fully written in Hungarian is the Funeral Sermon and Prayer, which dates to the 1190s. Although the orthography of these early texts differed considerably from that used today, contemporary Hungarians can still understand a great deal of the reconstructed spoken language, despite changes in grammar and vocabulary.\n\nA more extensive body of Hungarian literature arose after 1300. The earliest known example of Hungarian religious poetry is the 14th-century \"Lamentations of Mary\". The first Bible translation was the Hussite Bible in the 1430s.\n\nThe standard language lost its diphthongs, and several postpositions transformed into suffixes, including \"reá\" \"onto\" (the phrase \"utu rea \"onto the way\" found in the 1055 text would later become \"útra). There were also changes in the system of vowel harmony. At one time, Hungarian used six verb tenses. Today, only two are commonly used (present and past); the future is formed with an auxiliary verb and is usually not counted as a separate tense.\n\nIn 1533, Kraków printer Benedek Komjáti published the first Hungarian-language book set in movable type, a translation of the letters of Saint Paul entitled \"Az zenth Paal leueley magyar nyeluen\" (modern orthography: \"Az Szent Pál levelei magyar nyelven\").\n\nBy the 17th century, the language already closely resembled its present-day form, although two of the past tenses remained in use. German, Italian and French loans also began to appear. Further Turkish words were borrowed during the period of Ottoman rule (1541 to 1699).\n\nIn the 18th century a group of writers, most notably Ferenc Kazinczy, spearheaded a process of \"nyelvújítás\" (language revitalization). Some words were shortened (\"győzedelem\" > \"győzelem\", 'triumph' or 'victory'); a number of dialectal words spread nationally (\"e.g.\", \"cselleng\" 'dawdle'); extinct words were reintroduced (\"dísz\", 'décor'); a wide range of expressions were coined using the various derivative suffixes; and some other, less frequently used methods of expanding the language were utilized. This movement produced more than ten thousand words, most of which are used actively today.\n\nThe 19th and 20th centuries saw further standardization of the language, and differences between mutually comprehensible dialects gradually diminished.\n\nIn 1920, Hungary signed the Treaty of Trianon, losing 71 percent of its territory and one-third of the ethnic Hungarian population along with it.\n\nToday the language holds official status nationally in Hungary and regionally in Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, Austria and Slovenia.\n\nHungarian has about 13 million native speakers, of whom more than 9.8 million live in Hungary. According to the 2011 Hungarian census 9,896,333 people (99.6% of the total population) speak Hungarian, of whom 9,827,875 people (98.9%) speak it as a first language, while 68,458 people (0.7%) speak it as a second language. About 2.2 million speakers live in areas that were part of the Kingdom of Hungary before the Treaty of Trianon (1920). Of these, the largest group lives in Transylvania, the western half of present-day Romania, where there are approximately 1.25 million Hungarians. There are large Hungarian communities also in Slovakia, Serbia and Ukraine, and Hungarians can also be found in Austria, Croatia, and Slovenia, as well as about a million additional people scattered in other parts of the world. For example, there are more than one hundred thousand Hungarian speakers in the Hungarian American community and 1.5 million with Hungarian ancestry in the United States.\n\nHungarian is the official language of Hungary, and thus an official language of the European Union. Hungarian is also one of the official languages of Vojvodina and an official language of three municipalities in Slovenia: Hodoš, Dobrovnik and Lendava, along with Slovene. Hungarian is officially recognized as a minority or regional language in Austria, Croatia, Romania, Zakarpattia in Ukraine, and Slovakia. In Romania it is a recognized minority language used at local level in communes, towns and municipalities with an ethnic Hungarian population of over 20%.\n\nThe dialects of Hungarian identified by Ethnologue are: Alföld, West Danube, Danube-Tisza, King's Pass Hungarian, Northeast Hungarian, Northwest Hungarian, Székely and West Hungarian. These dialects are, for the most part, mutually intelligible. The Hungarian Csángó dialect, which is mentioned but not listed separately by Ethnologue, is spoken primarily in Bacău County in eastern Romania. The Csángó Hungarian group has been largely isolated from other Hungarian people, and they therefore preserved features that closely resemble earlier forms of Hungarian.\n\nHungarian has 14 vowel phonemes and 25 consonant phonemes. The vowel phonemes can be grouped as pairs of short and long vowels such as \"o\" and \"ó\". Most of the pairs have a similar pronunciation and vary significantly only in their duration. However, pairs \"a\"/\"á\" and \"e\"/\"é\" differ both in closedness and length.\n\nConsonant length is also distinctive in Hungarian. Most consonant phonemes can occur as geminates.\n\nThe sound voiced palatal plosive , written , sounds similar to 'd' in British English 'duty' (in fact, it is more similar to the Macedonian phoneme 'ѓ' as in 'ѓакон', \"deacon\", from \"diakon\"). It occurs in the name of the country, \"Magyarország\" (Hungary), pronounced .\n\nA single 'r' is pronounced as an alveolar tap (\"akkora\" 'of that size'), but a double 'r' is pronounced as an alveolar trill (\"akkorra\" 'by that time'), like in Spanish.\n\nPrimary stress is always on the first syllable of a word, as in Finnish and the neighbouring Slovak and Czech. There is a secondary stress on other syllables in compounds: \"viszontlátásra\" (\"goodbye\") is pronounced . Elongated vowels in non-initial syllables may seem to be stressed to an English-speaker, as length and stress correlate in English.\n\nHungarian, an agglutinative language, uses various affixes, mainly suffixes but also some prefixes and a circumfix, to change a word's meaning and its grammatical function.\n\nHungarian uses vowel harmony to attach suffixes to words. That means that most suffixes have two or three different forms, and the choice between them depends on the vowels of the head word. There are some minor and unpredictable exceptions to the rule.\n\nNouns have a large number of cases (between 18 and 35, depending on the definition), but they are generally formed regularly with suffixes. The nominative case is unmarked (\"az alma\" 'the apple') and, for example, the accusative is marked with the suffix \"–t\" (\"az almát\" '[I eat] the apple'). Half of the 18 cases express a combination of the source-location-target and surface-inside-proximity ternary distinctions (three times three cases); there is a separate case ending –\"ból\"/\"–ből\" meaning a combination of source and insideness: 'from inside of'.\n\nPossession is expressed by a possessive suffix on the possessed object, rather than the possessor as in English (Peter's apple becomes \"Péter almája\", literally 'Peter apple-his'). Noun plurals are formed with\"–k\" (\"az almák\" ‘the apples’), but after a numeral, the singular is used (\"két alma\" ‘two apples’, literally ‘two apple’; not \"*két almák\").\n\nUnlike English, Hungarian uses case suffixes and mostly postpositions, instead of prepositions.\n\nThere are two types of articles in Hungarian, definite and indefinite, which roughly correspond to the equivalents in English.\n\nAdjectives precede nouns (\"a piros alma\" 'the red apple') and have three degrees: positive (\"piros\" 'red'), comparative (\"pirosabb\" 'redder') and superlative (\"a legpirosabb\" 'the reddest').\n\nIf the noun takes the plural or a case, an attributive adjective is invariable: \"a piros almák\" 'the red apples'. However, a predicative adjective agrees with the noun: \"az almák pirosak\" 'the apples are red'. Adjectives by themselves can behave as nouns (and so can take case suffixes): \"Melyik almát kéred? – A pirosat.\" 'Which apple would you like? – The red one'.\n\nVerbs are conjugated according to two tenses (past and present), three moods (indicative, conditional and imperative-subjunctive), two numbers (singular or plural), three persons (first, second and third) and definiteness.\n\nThe last feature is most characteristic: the definite conjugation is used with a transitive verb whose (direct) object is definite (\"Péter eszi az almát\". \"Peter eats the apple\".), but the indefinite conjugation either for a verb with an indefinite direct object (\"Péter eszik egy almát\". \"Peter eats an apple\".) or for a verb without an object. (\"Péter eszik\". \"Peter eats\".)\nSince conjugation expresses the person and number, personal pronouns are usually omitted except for emphasis.\n\nThe present tense is unmarked, and the past is formed by using the suffix –t or –tt: \"hall\" 'hears'; \"hallott\" 'heard', past. Future may be expressed with the present tense (usually with a word defining the time of the event: \"holnap\" 'tomorrow') or by using the auxiliary verb \"fog\" (similar to the English 'will'), followed by the infinitive.\n\nThe indicative mood and the conditional mood are used both in the present and the past tenses. The conditional past is expressed by using the conjugated past form and the auxiliary word \"volna \"(\"hallott volna\" 'would have heard')\".\" The imperative mood is used only in the present tense.\n\nVerbs have verbal prefixes, which are also known as coverbs. Most of them define direction of movement: \"lemegy\" \"goes down\", \"felmegy\" \"goes up\". Some verbal prefixes give an aspect to the verb, such as the prefix \"meg-\", which generally marks telicity.\n\nVowel harmony also plays a major role in verb conjugations. All Hungarian verb conjugations (as well as postpositions and possessive suffixes, for that matter) can be thought of as 'templates' into which vowels are inserted. Based on the nature of a verb's infinitive, which always ends in '-ni', one can create a generic 'template', which has mostly consonants. The vowels are then inserted into the 'template' according to the rules of vowel harmony, based on the categorization of the vowel in the verb root (front, back, rounded, unrounded).\n\nThe neutral word order is subject–verb–object (SVO). However, Hungarian, a topic-prominent language, has a word order that depends not only on syntax but also on the topic-comment structure of the sentence (for example, what aspect is assumed to be known and what is emphasized).\n\nA Hungarian sentence generally has the following order: topic, comment (or focus), verb and the rest.\n\nThe topic shows that the proposition is only for that particular thing or aspect, and it implies that the proposition is not true for some others. For example, in \"\"Az almát János látja\".\" ('It is John who sees the apple'. Literally 'The apple John sees.'), the apple is in the topic, implying that other objects may be seen by not him but other people (the pear may be seen by Peter). The topic part may be empty.\n\nThe focus shows the new information for the listeners that may not have been known or that their knowledge must be corrected. For example, \"Én vagyok az apád\". ('I am your father'. Literally, 'It is I who am your father'.), from the movie \"The Empire Strikes Back\", the pronoun I (\"én\") is in the focus and implies that it is new information, and the listener thought that someone else is his father.\n\nAlthough Hungarian is sometimes described as having free word order, different word orders are generally not interchangeable, and the neutral order is not always correct to use. Also, the intonation is also different with different topic-comment structures. The topic usually has a rising intonation, the focus having a falling intonation. In the following examples, the topic is marked with italics, and the focus (comment) is marked with boldface.\n\nHungarian has a four-tiered system for expressing levels of politeness. From highest to lowest:\n\n\nThe four-tiered system has somewhat been eroded due to the recent expansion of \"tegeződés\"\".\n\nSome anomalies emerged with the arrival of multinational companies who have addressed their customers in the \"te\" (least polite) form right from the beginning of their presence in Hungary. A typical example is the Swedish furniture shop IKEA, whose web site and other publications address the customers in \"te\" form. When a news site asked IKEA—using the \"te\" form—why they address their customers this way, IKEA's PR Manager explained in his answer—using the \"ön\" form—that their way of communication reflects IKEA's open-mindedness and the Swedish culture. However IKEA in France use the most polite (\"vous\") form. Another example is the communication of Telenor (a mobile network operator) towards its customers. Telenor chose to communicate towards business customers in the polite \"ön\" form while all other customers are addressed in the less polite \"te\" form.\n\nGiving an accurate estimate for the total word count is difficult, since it is hard to define what to call \"a word\" in agglutinating languages, due to the existence of affixed words and compound words. To have a meaningful definition of compound words, we have to exclude such compounds whose meaning is the mere sum of its elements. The largest dictionaries from Hungarian to another language contain 120,000 words and phrases (but this may include redundant phrases as well, because of translation issues). The new desk lexicon of the Hungarian language contains 75,000 words and the Comprehensive Dictionary of Hungarian Language (to be published in 18 volumes in the next twenty years) will contain 110,000 words. The default Hungarian lexicon is usually estimated to comprise 60,000 to 100,000 words. (Independently of specific languages, speakers actively use at most 10,000 to 20,000 words, with an average intellectual using 25–30 thousand words.) However, all the Hungarian lexemes collected from technical texts, dialects etc. would all together add up to 1,000,000 words.\n\nParts of the Lexicon can be organized using word-bushes. (See an example on the right.) The words in these bushes share a common root, are related through inflection, derivation and compounding, and are usually broadly related in meaning.\n\nThe basic vocabulary shares some hundreds word roots with other Uralic languages like Finnish, Estonian, Mansi and Khanty. Examples of such include the verb \"él\" 'live' (Finnish \"elää\"), the numbers \"kettő\" 'two', \"három\" 'three', \"négy\" 'four' (cf. Mansi китыг \"kitig\", хурум \"khurum\", нила \"nila\",\nFinnish \"kaksi, kolme, neljä\", Estonian \"kaks, kolm, neli\", ), as well as \"víz\" 'water', \"kéz\" 'hand', \"vér\" 'blood', \"fej\" 'head' (cf. Finnish and Estonian \"vesi, käsi, veri\", Finnish \"pää\", Estonian \"pea\" or \"pää\").\n\nWords for elementary kinship and nature are more Ugric, less r-Turkic and less Slavic. Agricultural words are about 50% r-Turkic and 50% Slavic; pastoral terms are more r-Turkic, less Ugric and less Slavic. Finally, Christian and state terminology is more Slavic and less r-Turkic. The Slavic is most probably proto-Slovakian and/or -Slovenian. This is easily understood in the Uralic paradigm, proto-Magyars were first similar to Ob-Ugors who were mainly hunters, fishers & gatherers, but with some horses, too. Then they accultured to Bulgarian r-Turks, so the older layer of agriculture words (wine, beer, wheat, barley &c.) are purely r-Turkic, and also lots of termini of statesmanship & religion were, too.\n\nExcept for a few Latin and Greek loan-words, these differences are unnoticed even by native speakers; the words have been entirely adopted into the Hungarian lexicon. There are an increasing number of English loan-words, especially in technical fields.\n\nAnother source differs in that loanwords in Hungarian are held to constitute about 45% of bases in the language. Although the lexical percentage of native words in Hungarian is 55%, their use accounts for 88.4% of all words used (the percentage of loanwords used being just 11.6%). Therefore, the history of Hungarian has come, especially since the 19th century, to favor neologisms from original bases, whilst still having developed as many terms from neighboring languages in the lexicon.\n\nWords can be compounds or derived. Most derivation is with suffixes, but there is a small set of derivational prefixes as well.\n\nCompounds have been present in the language since the Proto-Uralic era. Numerous ancient compounds transformed to base words during the centuries. Today, compounds play an important role in vocabulary.\n\nA good example is the word \"arc\":\n\nCompounds are made up of two base words: the first is the prefix, the latter is the suffix. A compound can be \"subordinative\": the prefix is in logical connection with the suffix. If the prefix is the subject of the suffix, the compound is generally classified as a subjective one. There are objective, determinative, and adjunctive compounds as well. Some examples are given below:\n\nAccording to current orthographic rules, a subordinative compound word has to be written as a single word, without spaces; however, if the length of a compound of three or more words (not counting one-syllable verbal prefixes) is seven or more syllables long (not counting case suffixes), a hyphen must be inserted at the appropriate boundary to ease the determination of word boundaries for the reader.\n\nOther compound words are \"coordinatives\": there is no concrete relation between the prefix and the suffix. Subcategories include word duplications (to emphasise the meaning; \"olykor-olykor\"\n'really occasionally'), twin words (where a base word and a distorted form of it makes up a compound: \"gizgaz\", where the suffix 'gaz' means 'weed' and the prefix \"giz\" is the distorted form; the compound itself means 'inconsiderable weed'), and such compounds which have meanings, but neither their prefixes, nor their suffixes make sense (for example, \"hercehurca\" 'complex, obsolete procedures').\n\nA compound also can be made up by multiple (i.e., more than two) base words: in this case, at least one word element, or even both the prefix and the suffix is a compound. Some examples:\n\nHungarian words for the points of the compass are directly derived from the position of the Sun during the day in the Northern hemisphere.\n\n\nThere are two basic words for \"red\" in Hungarian: \"piros\" and \"vörös\" (variant: \"veres\"; compare with Estonian \"verev\" or Finnish \"punainen\"). (They are basic in the sense that one is not a sub-type of the other, as the English \"scarlet\" is of \"red\".) The word \"vörös\" is related to \"vér\", meaning \"blood\" (Finnish and Estonian \"veri\"). When they refer to an actual difference in colour (as on a colour chart), \"vörös\" usually refers to the deeper (darker and/or more red and less orange) hue of red. In English similar differences exist between \"scarlet\" and \"red\". While many languages have multiple names for this colour, often Hungarian scholars assume this is unique in recognizing two shades of red as separate and distinct \"folk colours\".\n\nHowever, the two words are also used independently of the above in collocations. \"Piros\" is learned by children first, as it is generally used to describe inanimate, artificial things, or things seen as cheerful or neutral, while \"vörös\" typically refers to animate or natural things (biological, geological, physical and astronomical objects), as well as serious or emotionally charged subjects.\n\nWhen the rules outlined above are in contradiction, typical collocations usually prevail. In some cases where a typical collocation does not exist, the use of either of the two words may be equally adequate.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Hungarian words for brothers and sisters are differentiated based upon relative age. There is also a general word for \"sibling\": \"testvér\", from \"test\" \"body\" and \"vér\" \"blood\"; \"i.e.\", originating from the same body and blood.\n\nIn addition, there are separate prefixes for several ancestors and descendants:\n\nThe words for \"boy\" and \"girl\" are applied with possessive suffixes. Nevertheless, the terms are differentiated with different declension or lexemes:\n\n\"Fia\" is only used in this, irregular possessive form; it has no nominative on its own (see inalienable possession). However, the word \"fiú\" can also take the regular suffix, in which case the resulting word \"(fiúja)\" will refer to a lover or partner (boyfriend), rather than a male offspring.\n\nThe word \"fiú\" (boy) is also often noted as an extreme example of the ability of the language to add suffixes to a word, by forming \"fiaiéi\", adding vowel-form suffixes only, where the result is quite a frequently used word:\n\n\nThe above word is often considered to be the longest word in Hungarian, although there are longer words like:\n\n\nWords of such length are not used in practice, but when spoken they are easily understood by natives. They were invented to show, in a somewhat facetious way, the ability of the language to form long words (see agglutinative language). They are not compound words—they are formed by adding a series of one and two-syllable suffixes (and a few prefixes) to a simple root (\"szent\", saint or holy).\nThere is virtually no limit for the length of words, but when too many suffixes are added, the meaning of the word becomes less clear, and the word becomes hard to understand, and will work like a riddle even for native speakers.\n\nThe English word best known as being of Hungarian origin is probably \"paprika\", from Serbo-Croatian \"papar\" \"pepper\" and the Hungarian diminutive \"-ka\". The most common however is \"coach\", from \"kocsi\", originally \"kocsi szekér\" \"car from/in the style of Kocs\". Others are:\n\n\nThe Hungarian language was originally written in right-to-left Old Hungarian runes, superficially similar in appearance to the better-known futhark runes but unrelated. When Stephen I of Hungary established the Kingdom of Hungary in the year 1000, the old system was gradually discarded in favour of the Latin alphabet and left-to-right order. Although now not used at all in everyday life, the old script is still known and practiced by some enthusiasts.\n\nModern Hungarian is written using an expanded Latin alphabet, and has a phonemic orthography, i.e. pronunciation can generally be predicted from the written language. In addition to the standard letters of the Latin alphabet, Hungarian uses several modified Latin characters to represent the additional vowel sounds of the language. These include letters with acute accents \"(á, é, í, ó, ú)\" to represent long vowels, and umlauts (\"ö\" and \"ü\") and their long counterparts \"ő\" and \"ű\" to represent front vowels. Sometimes (usually as a result of a technical glitch on a computer) or is used for , and for . This is often due to the limitations of the Latin-1 / ISO-8859-1 code page. These letters are not part of the Hungarian language, and are considered misprints. Hungarian can be properly represented with the Latin-2 / ISO-8859-2 code page, but this code page is not always available. (Hungarian is the only language using both and .) Unicode includes them, and so they can be used on the Internet.\n\nAdditionally, the letter pairs , , and represent the palatal consonants , , and (a little like the \"d+y\" sounds in British \"\"du\"ke\" or American \"woul\"d y\"ou\") – a bit like saying \"d\" with the tongue pointing to the palate.\n\nHungarian uses for and for , which is the reverse of Polish usage. The letter is and is . These digraphs are considered single letters in the alphabet. The letter is also a \"single letter digraph\", but is pronounced like (English ), and appears mostly in old words. The letters and are exotic remnants and are hard to find even in longer texts. Some examples still in common use are \"madzag\" (\"string\"), \"edzeni\" (\"to train (athletically)\") and \"dzsungel\" (\"jungle\").\n\nSometimes additional information is required for partitioning words with digraphs: házszám (\"street number\") = \"ház\" (\"house\") + \"szám\" (\"number\"), not an unintelligible \"házs\" + \"zám\".\n\nHungarian distinguishes between long and short vowels, with long vowels written with acutes. It also distinguishes between long and short consonants, with long consonants being doubled. For example, \"lenni\" (\"to be\"), \"hozzászólás\" (\"comment\"). The digraphs, when doubled, become trigraphs: + = , e.g. \"művésszel\" (\"with an artist\"). But when the digraph occurs at the end of a line, all of the letters are written out. For example, (\"with a bus\"):\n\nWhen the first lexeme of a compound ends in a digraph and the second lexeme starts with the same digraph, both digraphs are written out: \"jegy\" + \"gyűrű\" = \"jegygyűrű\" (\"engagement/wedding ring\", \"jegy\" means \"sign\", \"mark\". The term \"jegyben lenni/járni\" means \"to be engaged\"; \"gyűrű\" means \"ring\").\n\nUsually a trigraph is a double digraph, but there are a few exceptions: \"tizennyolc\" (\"eighteen\") is a concatenation of \"tizen\" + \"nyolc\". There are doubling minimal pairs: \"tol\" (\"push\") vs. \"toll\" (\"feather\" or \"pen\").\n\nWhile to English speakers they may seem unusual at first, once the new orthography and pronunciation are learned, written Hungarian is almost completely phonemic (except for etymological spellings and \"ly, j\" representing ).\n\nThe word order is basically from general to specific. This is a typical analytical approach and is used generally in Hungarian.\n\nThe Hungarian language uses the so-called eastern name order, in which the surname (general, deriving from the family) comes first and the given name comes last. If a second given name is used, this follows the first given name.\n\nFor clarity, in foreign languages Hungarian names are usually represented in the western name order. Sometimes, however, especially in the neighbouring countries of Hungary – where there is a significant Hungarian population – the Hungarian name order is retained, as it causes less confusion there.\n\nFor an example of foreign use, the birth name of the Hungarian-born physicist, the \"father of the hydrogen bomb\" was Teller Ede, but he immigrated to the United States in the 1930s and thus became known as Edward Teller. Prior to the mid-20th century, given names were usually translated along with the name order; this is no longer as common. For example, the pianist uses \"András Schiff\" when abroad, not \"Andrew Schiff\" (in Hungarian \"Schiff András\"). If a second given name is present, it becomes a middle name and is usually written out in full, rather than truncated to an initial.\n\nIn modern usage, foreign names retain their order when used in Hungarian. Therefore:\n\n\nBefore the 20th century, not only was it common to reverse the order of foreign personalities, they were also \"Hungarianised\": \"Goethe János Farkas\" (originally Johann Wolfgang Goethe). This usage sounds odd today, when only a few well-known personalities are referred to using their Hungarianised names, including \"Verne Gyula\" (Jules Verne), \"Marx Károly\" (Karl Marx), \"Kolumbusz Kristóf\" (Christopher Columbus, note that it is also translated in English).\n\nSome native speakers disapprove of this usage; the names of certain historical religious personalities (including popes), however, are always Hungarianised by practically all speakers, such as \"Luther Márton\" (Martin Luther), \"Husz János\" (Jan Hus), \"Kálvin János\" (John Calvin); just like the names of monarchs, for example the king of Spain, Juan Carlos I is referred to as \"I. János Károly\" or the queen of the UK, Elizabeth II is referred to as \"II. Erzsébet\".\n\nJapanese names, which are usually written in western order in the rest of Europe, retain their original order in Hungarian, e. g. \"Kuroszava Akira\" instead of Akira Kurosawa.\n\nThe Hungarian convention for date and time is to go from the generic to the specific: 1. year, 2. month, 3. day, 4. hour, 5. minute, (6. second)\n\nThe year and day are always written in Arabic numerals, followed by a full stop. The month can be written by its full name or can be abbreviated, or even denoted by Roman or Arabic numerals. Except for the first case (month written by its full name), the month is followed by a full stop. Usually, when the month is written in letters, there is no leading zero before the day. On the other hand, when the month is written in Arabic numerals, a leading zero is common, but not obligatory. Except at the beginning of a sentence, the name of the month always begins with a lower-case letter.\n\nHours, minutes, and seconds are separated by a colon (H:m:s). Fractions of a second are separated by a full stop from the rest of the time. Hungary generally uses the 24-hour clock format, but in verbal (and written) communication 12-hour clock format can also be used. See below for usage examples.\n\nDate and time may be separated by a comma or simply written one after the other.\n\n\nDate separated by hyphen is also spreading, especially on datestamps. Here – just like the version separated by full stops – leading zeros are in use.\n\n\nWhen only hours and minutes are written in a sentence (so not only \"displaying\" time), these parts can be separated by a full stop (e.g. \"Találkozzunk 10.35-kor.\" – \"Let's meet at 10.35.\"), or it is also regular to write hours in normal size, and minutes put in superscript (and not necessarily) underlined (e.g. \"A találkozó 10-kor kezdődik.\" \"or\" \"A találkozó 10-kor kezdődik.\" – \"The meeting begins at 10.35.\").\n\nAlso, in verbal and written communication it is common to use \"délelőtt\" (literally \"before noon\") and \"délután\" (lit. \"after noon\") abbreviated as \"de.\" and \"du.\" respectively. Délelőtt and délután is said or written before the time, e.g. \"Délután 4 óra van.\" – \"It's 4 p.m.\". However e.g. \"délelőtt 5 óra\" (should mean \"5 a.m.\") or \"délután 10 óra\" (should mean \"10 p.m.\") are never used, because at these times the sun is not up, instead \"hajnal\" (\"dawn\"), \"reggel\" (\"morning\"), \"este\" (\"evening\") and \"éjjel\" (\"night\") is used, however there are no exact rules for the use of these, as everybody uses them according to their habits (e.g. somebody may have woken up at 5 a.m. so he/she says \"Reggel 6-kor ettem.\" – \"I had food at \"*morning\" 6.\", and somebody woke up at 11 a.m. so he/she says \"Hajnali 6-kor még aludtam.\" – \"I was still sleeping at \"*dawn\" 6.\"). Roughly, these expressions mean these times:\n\n\nAlthough address formatting is increasingly being influenced by standard European conventions, the traditional Hungarian style is:\n\nBudapest, Deák Ferenc tér 1. 1052\n\nSo the order is: 1) settlement (most general), 2) street/square/etc. (more specific), 3) house number (most specific) 4)(HU-)postcode. The house number may be followed by the storey and door numbers. The HU- part before the postcode is only for incoming postal traffic from foreign countries. Addresses on envelopes and postal parcels should be formatted and placed on the right side as follows:\n\nName of the recipient\nSettlement\nStreet address (up to door number if necessary)\n(HU-)postcode\n\n\"Note: The stress is always placed on the first syllable of each word. The remaining syllables all receive an equal, lesser stress. All syllables are pronounced clearly and evenly, even at the end of a sentence, unlike in English.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way causal effect. A closely related term is interconnectivity, which deals with the interactions of interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising emergent phenomena. \"Interaction\" has different tailored meanings in various sciences. Changes can also involve interaction.\n\nCasual examples of interaction outside science include:\n\nIn physics, a fundamental interaction (depending on the nature of the interaction, it might also be called a fundamental force) is a process by which elementary particles interact with each other. An interaction is often described as a physical field, and is mediated by the exchange of gauge bosons between particles. For example, the interaction of charged particles takes place through the mediation of electromagnetic fields, whereas beta decay occurs by means of the weak interaction. An interaction is fundamental when it cannot be described in terms of other interactions. There are four known fundamental interactions in nature: The electromagnetic, strong, weak and gravitational interactions. The weak and electromagnetic interactions are unified in electroweak theory, which is unified with the strong force in the standard model.\n\nInteractions between atoms and molecules:\n\nIn molecular biology, the knowledge on gene/protein interaction among themselves and with their metabolites is referred to as molecular pathways.\n\nIn medicine, most medications can be safely used with other medicines, but particular combinations of medicines need to be monitored for interactions, often by the pharmacist. Interactions between medications fall generally into one of two main categories:\n\nIn terms of efficacy, there can be three types of interactions between medications: additive, synergistic, and antagonistic.\n\nGeneticists work with a number of different genetic interaction modes to characterize how the combination of two mutations affect (or does not affect) the phenotype:\nnoninteractive, synthetic, asynthetic, suppressive, epistatic, conditional, additive, single-nonmonotonic and double-nonmonotonic.\nFurther characterizations is enhancement interaction and nonadditive interaction. Biosemioticists investigate sign-mediated interactions within and between organisms that underlie syntactic, pragmatic and semantic rules.\n\nThe word epistasis is also used for genetic interaction in some contexts.\n\nIn sociology, social interaction is a dynamic, changing sequence of social actions between individuals (or groups) who modify their actions and reactions due to the actions by their interaction partner(s). Social interactions can be differentiated into accidental, repeated, regular, and regulated. Social interactions form the basis of social relations.\n\nIn statistics, an interaction is a term in a statistical model in which the effect of two, or more, variables is not simply additive.\n\nIf we were examining the effect of two variables, gender and premature birth, on health outcomes, we would describe any difference in health outcome scores between genders as a main effect. Similarly any difference in scores of full term/premature birth would be described as a main effect. The presence of an interaction effect implies that the effect of gender on health outcome varies as a function of premature birth status.\n\nIn media, interactivity is a feature of the media in question and as digital technology becomes more accessible to the masses interest in interactivity is increasing and becoming a cultural trend especially in the arts.\n\n\n\nl\n"}

Kluge Center at the Library of Congress. The Prize is conferred in a ceremony in the Great Hall of the Jefferson Building, attended by American political leaders to dramatize America's commitment to these areas of human inquiry. The Prize winner will give an address, will remain in residence at the Library of Congress for a short time thereafter, and will be expected to have some informal interaction with Members of the United States Congress.\n\nMembers of the Scholars' Council, as described in the appended Charter of the John W. Kluge Center, and holders of the Kluge Chairs will be among those offering recommendations to the Librarian of Congress concerning recipients of the Kluge Prize.\n\nEndowed by Library benefactor John W. Kluge, the Kluge prize rewards lifetime achievement in the wide range of disciplines not covered by the Nobel Prizes. Such disciplines include history, philosophy, politics, anthropology, sociology, religion, criticism in the arts and humanities, and linguistics. The award is at the financial level of the Nobel awards.\n\nThe prize is international; the recipient may be of any nationality, writing in any language. The main criterion for a recipient of the Kluge Prize is deep intellectual accomplishment in the human sciences. The recipient's body of work should evidence growth in maturity and range over the years. The recipient will have demonstrated unusual distinction within a given area of inquiry and across disciplines in the human sciences. Significantly, the recipient's writings should be, in large part, understandable and important for those involved in public affairs.\n\nIn order to ensure consideration of as wide a pool of candidates as possible, in 2001, the Librarian of Congress solicited nominations for the Kluge Prize from a broad range of individuals knowledgeable about the humanities and social sciences in colleges, universities, and research institutions across the globe, as well as from independent scholars and writers.\n\nIn 2002, the Librarian of the Library of Congress called upon a Scholars' Council of 20 preeminent scholars from around the world to consider the range of nominations. The council had been established to offer suggestions and advice on the choice of scholars to study at the John W. Kluge Center at the Library.\n\nBased upon extensive research and further recommendations, the director of the Office of Scholarly Programs prepared a list of candidates for the Librarian's consideration in 2003. In addition to soliciting numerous outside reviews for each of these scholars, the Librarian called upon an expert staff of curators in the Library to conduct extensive biographical and bibliographical research as well as to gather published reviews and discussions of each candidate's work, prepare abstracts of translations of key articles from material available only in foreign languages, and provide a brief characterization and evaluation of the scholarly corpus of the candidate.\n\nFinally, detailed dossiers on each candidate were sent to the members of the Final Kluge Prize Review Panel. Deliberating at the Library, this panel submitted its recommendations to the Librarian, who then made the final decision.\n\nSource: Library of Congress\n\n"}

The earliest image of Iceland personified as a woman seems to appear first in association with the poem \"Ofsjónir við jarðarför Lovísu drottningar 1752\" ('Visions at the funeral of Queen Louise, 1752') by Eggert Ólafsson (1752), but this image does not survive.\n\nThe word \"fjallkona\" is attested for the first time in the poem \"Eldgamla Ísafold\" by Bjarni Thorarensen from the first decade of the nineteenth century. From that moment onwards she became a well-known symbol in Icelandic poetry.\n\nThe oldest surviving image of \"the lady of the mountains\" was published in the last volume of an English translation of Icelandic folk-tales by Eiríkur Magnússon and G. E. J. Powell, \"Icelandic Legends, Collected by Jón Arnason\" (1864–66). It is the work of the German painter Johann Baptist Zwecker, who drew it to specifications provided by Eiríkur. Eiríkur described the picture in a letter to Jón Sigurðsson (11 April 1866) thus:\n\nAlso very popular is the image designed by Benedikt Sveinbjarnarson Gröndal on a memorial card of the National holiday in 1874. Since the establishment of the Icelandic republic in 1944 it has been traditional for a woman in traditional dress to read the poem on the national holiday (17 June).\n\nThe idea of the \"fjallkonan\" as motherland was a counterweight to the idea of the Danish King as 'father' in nineteenth-century Iceland under Danish rule, and after independence in 1944 became one of the images through which feminism and the idea of powerful women, such as Iceland's first female president Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, were made to seem a natural part of Icelandic culture.\n\nThe image of the \"fjallkonan\" has also been prominent among Vestur Íslendingar in Canada. A woman dressed as the Lady of the Mountain first appeared at the Iceland Days in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in 1924. Here too, the \"fjallkona\" has been deployed to promote feminism.\n\n"}

Lamaholot people speak the Lamaholot language with different dialects, the number of speakers counts between 150,000 and 200,000.\n\nLamaholot people's famous traditional dance is a war dance known as \"Hedung\".\n\nSince the 16th century the territory of the Lamaholot was the object of the claims of the Sultanate of Makassar, Portugal and the Netherlands. Until the middle of the 19th century Lamaholot were under the Portuguese colonial administration, then under the Netherlands in 1859-1942, and until the middle of the 20th century they were formally submitted to the Rajas of Larantuka and Adonara.\n\nThe Lamaholot language belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian languages of the Austronesian languages family. The language is divided into many dialects, the most common are the Western Lamaholot (Muang and Pukaunu), Lamaholot (Taka, Levotaka, Mandiri Island), and Western Solor. Language is a means for wide communication between the numerous ethnic groups living in the area around Larantuka and Solor. On the island of Flores, the Lamaholot people speak Bahasa Nagi (Larantuka Malay) and Mandarut language, a dialect of the Malay language.\n\nMost Lamaholot people are Roman Catholics. Some of them are Muslims or devotees of a traditional monotheistic religion who believe in a god whom they call \"Lera Wulan Tanah Ekan\" (The combined power of the Sun, Moon, and Earth), death cults and shamanism. The Lamaholot people also preserve rich verbal and musical folklore.\n\nTraditional social organization is strictly based on patrilineal birth. They also maintained a characteristic of descent line that divides into \"origin groups\" or phratries. Marriages occur across on the matrilateral side, with a marital settlement of Patrilocal residence. The family unit is small.\n\nThe main occupation is manual tropical farming. Dominant agricultural crops are such as corn, dried rice, millet, yam, cassava, sweet potato, legumes, pumpkin, various fruits and vegetables. Fishing is developed on the coast. Livestock plays an auxiliary role. The main dietary food includes boiled corn and rice with vegetable and fish seasonings. Residents of a number of coastal villages specialize in intermediary trade in textiles, clothing and agricultural implements. In the Lamalera village on Lomblen island and Lamakera village on Solor island, whaling is developed.\n\nTraditional cumulus settlements (in the mountains) are surrounded by a dense hedge of corals, houses are skeleton-pillared, rectangular, with a high steep roof. Before the beginning of the 20th century, there were long houses. Modern settlements are coastal farms, the dwelling is designed for a small family. They also adopt Malay-style clothing.\n"}

The Israeli-American historian Nitzan Lebovic identified \"Lebensphilosophie\" with the tight relation between a \"corpus of life-concepts\" and what the German education system came to see, during the 1920s, as the proper \"Lebenskunde\", the ‘teaching of life’ or ‘science of life’—a name that seemed to support the broader philosophical outlook long held by most biologists of the time. In his book Lebovic traces the transformation of the post-Nietzschean \"Lebensphilosophie\" from the radical aesthetics of the Stefan George Circle to Nazi or \"biopolitical\" rhetoric and politics. \n\nThis philosophy pays special attention to \"life\" as a whole, which can only be understood from within.

{"id": "95176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95176", "title": "Lev Vygotsky", "text": "Lev Vygotsky\n\nLev Semyonovich Vygotsky (; – June 11, 1934) was a Soviet psychologist, the founder of an unfinished Marxist theory of human cultural and bio-social development commonly referred to as \"cultural-historical psychology\" (although the phrase never actually occurred in Vygotsky's writings), a prominent advocate for a \"science of the Superman\", a new psychological theory of consciousness, and leader of the Vygotsky Circle (also referred to as \"Vygotsky-Luria Circle\").\n\nDespite his claim for a \"new psychology\" that he foresaw as a \"science of the Superman\" of the Communist future, Vygotsky's main work was in developmental psychology and he proposed a theory of the development of \"higher psychological functions\" that saw human psychological development as emerging through interpersonal connections and actions with the social environment. During an earlier mechanistic and reductionist \"instrumental psychology\" period of his career (1920s), he argued that human psychological development can be formed through the use of meaningless (i.e., virtually random) signs that he viewed as psychological equivalent of instrument use in human labor and industry. Later, in the \"holistic\" period of his career (first half of 1930s), Vygotsky rejected his earlier reductionist views on signs. Under the increasing influence from the holistic thinking of the scholars primarily associated with German-American Gestalt psychology movement Vygotsky adopted their views on \"psychological systems\" and—inspired by Kurt Lewin's \"Topological (and vector) psychology\"—introduced the vague notion of the \"zone of proximal development\". It was during this period that he identified play of young children as their \"leading activity\", that he understood as the main source of preschoolers psychological development, which he viewed as the inseparable unity of emotional, volitional, and cognitive development. \n\nAs early as in mid-1920s, Vygotsky's ideas were introduced in the West, but he remained virtually unknown until the early 1980s when the popularity among educators of the developmental psychology of Jean Piaget (1896-1980) started to decline and, in contrast, Vygotsky's notion of the \"zone of proximal development\" became a central component of the development of the so-called \"social constructivist\" turn in developmental and, primarily, educational psychology and practice. A \"Review of General Psychology\" study, published in 2002, ranked Vygotsky as the 83rd top psychologist of the twentieth century and the third (and the last) Russian on the top-100 list after Ivan Pavlov and Vygotsky's longtime collaborator Alexander Luria.\n\nThe early twenty-first century has seen scholarly reevaluations of the popular version of Vygotsky's legacy (sometimes termed \"Vygotsky cult\", \"the cult of Vygotsky\", or even \"the cult of personality around Vygotsky\"), which is referred to as the \"revisionist revolution in Vygotsky Studies\".\n\nThe studies conducted in the framework of the \"revisionist turn\" in Vygotsky studes in the decade of 2010s revealed not only systematic and massive falsifications and distortions of Vygotsky's legacy, but also demonstrated rapid decrease of this author's popularity in international scholarship that started in 2016-2017 and the downfall even further accelerated in 2018у. This situation has been described as the \"Vygotsky bubble\" (\"пузырь Выготского\"; also, informally, the \"vygo_bubble\") and foundational crisis in global \"Vygotskiana\". The reasons of this crisis are not entirely clear yet and are being discussed in scholarly circles.\n\nLev Vygotsky was born to the Vygodskii family in the town of Orsha, Belarus (then belonging to Russian Empire) into a non-religious middle-class family of Russian Jewish extraction. His father Simkha Vygodskii was a banker. Young Lev Vygodskii was raised in the city of Gomel, where he was homeschooled until 1911 and then obtained formal degree (with distinction) in a private Jewish Gimnasium, which allowed him entrance to a university. In 1913 Lev Vygodskii was admitted to the Moscow University by mere ballot through a \"Jewish Lottery\": at the time a three percent Jewish student quota was administered for entry in Moscow and Saint Petersburg universities. He had interest in humanities and social sciences, but at the insistence of his parents he applied to the medical school in Moscow University. During the first semester of study he transferred to the law school. There he studied law and, in parallel, he attended lectures at fully official, but privately funded and non degree granting Shaniavskii \". His early interests were in the arts and, primarily, in the topics of the history of the Jewish people, the tradition, culture and Jewish identity. In contrast, during this period he was highly critical of the ideas of both socialism and Zionism, and proposed the solution of the \"Jewish question\" by return to the traditional Jewish Orthodoxy.\n\nLev Vygodskii never completed his formal studies at the Imperial Moscow University and, thus, he never obtained a university degree: his studies were interrupted by the October Bolshevik uprising in 1917 in the country's capital Petrograd and the second largest city Moscow. Following these events, he left Moscow and eventually returned to Gomel, where he lived after the October Socialist Revolution of 1917 occurred. There is virtually no information about his life during the years in Gomel (that administratively belonged to the Ukrainian State at the time) after the German occupation during the WWI, until the Bolsheviks captured the town in 1919. Since then he was an active participant of major social transformation under the Bolshevik (Communist) rule and a fairly prominent representative of the Bolshevik government in Gomel from 1919 to 1923. By the early 1920s, as reflected in his journalistic publications of the time, he informally changed his Jewish-sounding birth name, 'Lev Símkhovich Výgodskii' (), with the surname becoming \"Vygótskii\" and the patronymic 'Símkhovich' becoming the Slavic 'Semiónovich'. It was under this pen-name that the fame subsequently came to him. His daughters (subsequently born in 1925 and 1930) and other relatives, though, preserved their original family name 'Vygodskii'. The traditional English spelling of his last name nowadays is 'Vygotsky'.\n\nIn January 1924, Vygotsky took part in the Second All-Russian Psychoneurological Congress in Petrograd (soon thereafter renamed Leningrad). After the Congress, Vygotsky received an invitation to become a research fellow at the Psychological Institute in Moscow. Vygotsky moved to Moscow with his new wife, Roza Smekhova. He began his career at the Psychological Institute as a \"staff scientist, second class\". By the end of 1925, Vygotsky completed his dissertation in 1925 entitled, \"The Psychology of Art\", that was not published until the 1960s and a book entitled, \"Pedagogical Psychology\", that apparently was created on the basis of lecture notes that he prepared in Gomel while he was a psychology instructor at local educational establishments. In summer 1925 he made his first and only trip abroad to a London congress on the education of the deaf. Upon return to the Soviet Union, he was hospitalized due to relapse of tuberculosis and, having miraculously survived, would remain an invalid and out of job until the end of 1926. His dissertation was accepted as the prerequisite of scholarly degree, which was awarded to Vygotsky in fall 1925 \"in absentia\".\n\nAfter his release from hospital Vygotsky did theoretical and methodological work on the crisis in psychology, but never finished the draft of the manuscript and interrupted his work on it around mid-1927. The manuscript was published later with notable editorial interventions and distortions in 1982 and presented by the editors as one of the most important Vygotsky's works. In this early manuscript, Vygotsky argued for the formation of a general psychology that could unite the naturalist objectivist strands of psychological science with the more philosophical approaches of Marxist orientation. However, he also harshly criticized those of his colleagues who attempted to build a \"Marxist Psychology\" as an alternative to the naturalist and philosophical schools. He argued that if one wanted to build a truly Marxist Psychology, there were no shortcuts to be found by merely looking for applicable quotes in the writings of Marx. Rather one should look for a methodology that was in accordance with the Marxian spirit.\n\nIn 1926-30 Vygotsky worked on a research programme investigating the development of higher cognitive functions of logical memory, selective attention, decision making, and language comprehension, from early forms of primal psychological functions. During this period he gathered a group of collaborators including Alexander Luria, Boris Varshava, Alexei Leontiev, Leonid Zankov, and several others. Vygotsky guided his students in researching this phenomenon from three different perspectives: \n\nIn the early 1930s Vygotsky experienced deep crisis, personal and theoretical, and after a period of massive self-criticism made an attempt at a radical revision of his theory. The work of the representatives of the Gestalt psychology and other holistic scholars was instrumental in this theoretical shift. In 1932-1934 Vygotsky was aiming at establishing a psychological theory of consciousness, but because of his death this theory remained only in a very sketchy and unfinished form.\n\nVygotsky was a pioneering psychologist and his major works span six separate volumes, written over roughly ten years, from \"Psychology of Art\" (1925) to \"Thought and Language\" [or \"Thinking and Speech\"] (1934). Vygotsky's interests in the fields of developmental psychology, child development, and education were extremely diverse. His philosophical framework includes interpretations of the cognitive role of mediation tools, as well as the re-interpretation of well-known concepts in psychology such as internalization of knowledge. Vygotsky introduced the notion of zone of proximal development, a metaphor capable of describing the potential of human cognitive development. His work covered topics such as the origin and the psychology of art, development of higher mental functions, philosophy of science and the methodology of psychological research, the relation between learning and human development, concept formation, interrelation between language and thought development, play as a psychological phenomenon, learning disabilities, and abnormal human development (aka \"defectology\"). His scientific thinking underwent several major transformations throughout his career, but generally Vygotsky's legacy may be divided into two fairly distinct periods, and the transitional phase between the two during which Vygotsky experienced the crisis in his theory and personal life. These are the mechanistic \"instrumental\" period of the 1920s, integrative \"holistic\" period of the 1930s, and the transitional years of, roughly, 1929-1931. Each of these periods is characterized by its distinct themes and theoretical innovations.\n\nVygotsky studied child development and the significant roles of cultural mediation and interpersonal communication. He observed how higher mental functions developed through these interactions, and also represented the shared knowledge of a culture. This process is known as internalization. \"Internalization\" may be understood in one respect as \"knowing how\". For example, the practices of riding a bicycle or pouring a cup of milk initially, are outside and beyond the child. The mastery of the skills needed for performing these practices occurs through the activity of the child within society. A further aspect of internalization is \"appropriation\", in which children take tools and adapt them to personal use, perhaps using them in unique ways. Internalizing the use of a pencil allows the child to use it very much for personal ends rather than drawing exactly what others in society have drawn previously.\n\nIn 1930s Vygotsky was engaged in massive reconstruction of his theory of his \"instrumental\" period of the 1920s. Around 1929-1930 he realized numerous deficiencies and imperfections of the earlier work of the Vygotsky Circle and criticized it on a number of occasions: in 1929, 1930, in 1931, and in 1932. Specifically, Vygotsky criticized his earlier idea of radical separation between the \"lower\" and \"higher\" psychological functions and, around 1932, appears to abandon it.\n\nVygotsky's self-criticism was complemented by external criticism for a number of issues, including the separation between the \"higher\" and the \"lower\" psychological functions, impracticality and inapplicability of his theory in social practices (such as industry or education) during the time of rapid social change, and vulgar Marxist interpretation of human psychological processes. Critics also pointed to his overemphasis on the role of language and, on the other hand, the ignorance of the emotional factors in human development. Major figures in Soviet psychology such as Sergei Rubinstein criticized Vygotsky's notion of mediation and its development in the works of students. Following criticism and in response to generous offer from the highest officials in Soviet Ukraine, a major group of Vygotsky's associates, the members of the Vygotsky Circle, including Luria, Mark Lebedinsky, and Leontiev, moved from Moscow to Ukraine to establish the Kharkov school of psychology. In the second half of the 1930s, Vygotsky was criticized again for his involvement in the cross-disciplinary study of the child known as paedology and uncritical borrowings from contemporary \"bourgeois\" science. Considerable critique came from the alleged Vygotsky's followers, such as Leontiev and members of his research group in Kharkov. Much of this early criticism was later discarded by these Vygotskian scholars as well.\n\nThe period of major revision of Vygotsky's theory and its transition from mechanist orientation of his 1920s to integrative holistic science of the 1930s. During this period Vygotsky was under particularly strong influence of holistic theories of German-American group of proponents of Gestalt psychology, most notably, the peripheral participants of the Gestalt movement Kurt Goldstein and Kurt Lewin. However, Vygotsky's work of this period remained largely fragmentary and unfinished and, therefore, unpublished.\n\n\"Zone of proximal development\" (ZPD) is Vygotsky's term for the range of tasks that a child is in the process of learning to complete. In the original Vygotsky's writings this phrase is used in three different meanings. Vygotsky viewed the ZPD as a better way to explain the relation between children’s learning and cognitive development. Prior to the ZPD, the relation between learning and development could be boiled down to the following three major positions: 1) Development always precedes learning (e.g., constructivism): children first need to meet a particular maturation level before learning can occur; 2) Learning and development cannot be separated, but instead occur simultaneously (e.g., behaviorism): essentially, learning is development; and 3) learning and development are separate, but interactive processes (e.g., gestaltism): one process always prepares the other process, and vice versa. Vygotsky rejected these three major theories because he believed that learning should always precede development in the ZPD. According to Vygotsky, through the assistance of a more capable person, a child is able to learn skills or aspects of a skill that go beyond the child’s actual developmental or maturational level. The lower limit of ZPD is the level of skill reached by the child working independently (also referred to as the child's developmental level). The upper limit is the level of potential skill that the child is able to reach with the assistance of a more capable instructor. In this sense, the ZPD provides a prospective view of cognitive development, as opposed to a retrospective view that characterizes development in terms of a child’s independent capabilities.\n\nPerhaps Vygotsky's most important contribution concerns the inter-relationship of language development and thought. This problem was explored in Vygotsky's book, \"Thinking and speech\", entitled in Russian, \"Myshlenie i rech\", that was published in 1934. In fact, this book was a mere collection of essays and scholarly papers that Vygotsky wrote during different periods of his thought development and included writings of his \"instrumental\" and \"holistic\" periods. Vygotsky never saw the book published: it was published posthumously, edited by his closest associates (Kolbanovskii, Zankov, and Shif) not sooner than December, 1934, i.e., half a year after his death. First English translation was published in 1962 (with several later revised editions) heavily abbreviated and under an alternative and incorrect translation of the title \"Thought and Language\" for the Russian title \"Mysl' i iazyk\". The book establishes the explicit and profound connection between speech (both silent inner speech and oral language), and the development of mental concepts and cognitive awareness. Vygotsky described inner speech as being qualitatively different from verbal external speech. Although Vygotsky believed inner speech developed from external speech via a gradual process of \"internalization\" (i.e., transition from the external to the internal), with younger children only really able to \"think out loud\", he claimed that in its mature form, inner speech would not resemble spoken language as we know it (in particular, being greatly compressed). Hence, thought itself developing socially.\n\nVygotsky died of tuberculosis on June 11, 1934, at the age of 37, in Moscow, Soviet Union. One of Vygotsky's last private notebook entries gives a proverbial, yet very pessimistic self-assessment of his contribution to psychological theory:\n\nThis is the final thing I have done in psychology – and I will like Moses die at the summit, having glimpsed the promised land but without setting foot on it. Farewell, dear creations. The rest is silence.\n\nImmediately after his death, Vygotsky was proclaimed one of the leading psychologists in the Soviet Union, although his stellar reputation was somewhat undermined by the decree of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 1936 that denounced the mass movement, discipline, and related social practice of the so-called pedology. Yet, even despite some criticisms and censorship of his works—most notably, in the post-Stalin era in the Soviet Union of 1960s-1980s by his Russian alleged and self-proclaimed best students and followers—Vygotsky always remained among the most quoted scholars in the field and has become a cult figure for a number of contemporary intellectuals and practitioners in Russia and the international psychological and educational community alike.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, the work of the group of Vygotsky's students known as the Vygotsky Circle was vital for preserving and, in many respects, distorting the scientific legacy of Lev Vygotsky. The members of the group subsequently laid a foundation for Vygotskian psychology's systematic development in such diverse fields as the psychology of memory (P. Zinchenko), perception, sensation, and movement (Zaporozhets, Asnin, A. N. Leont'ev), personality (Lidiya Bozhovich, Asnin, A. N. Leont'ev), will and volition (Zaporozhets, A. N. Leont'ev, P. Zinchenko, L. Bozhovich, Asnin), psychology of play (G. D. Lukov, Daniil El'konin) and psychology of learning (P. Zinchenko, L. Bozhovich, D. El'konin), as well as the theory of step-by-step formation of mental actions (Pyotr Gal'perin), general psychological activity theory (A. N. Leont'ev) and psychology of action (Zaporozhets). Andrey Puzyrey elaborated the ideas of Vygotsky in respect of psychotherapy and even in the broader context of deliberate psychological intervention (psychotechnique), in general. In Laszlo Garai founded a Vygotskian research group.\n\nIn North America, Vygotsky's work was known from the end of the 1920s through a series of publications in English, but it did not have a major impact on research in general. In 1962 a translation of his posthumous 1934 book, \"Thinking and Speech\", published with the title,\"Thought and Language\", did not seem to change the situation considerably. It was only after an eclectic compilation of partly rephrased and partly translated works of Vygotsky and his collaborators, published in 1978 under Vygotsky's name as \"Mind in Society\", that the Vygotsky boom started in the West: originally, in North America, and later, following the North American example, spread to other regions of the world. This version of Vygotskian science is typically associated with the names of its chief proponents Michael Cole, James Wertsch, their associates and followers, and is relatively well-known under the names of \"cultural-historical activity theory\" (aka CHAT) or—yet more distant from Vygotsky's legacy--\"activity theory\". Scaffolding, a concept introduced by Wood, Bruner, and Ross in 1976, is somewhat related to the idea of ZPD, although Vygotsky never used the term.\n\nA critique of the North American interpretation of Vygotsky's ideas and, somewhat later, its global spread and dissemination appeared in the 1980s. The early 1980s criticism of Russian and Western \"Vygotskian\" scholars continued throughout the 1990s. Thus, different authors emphasized the biased and fragmented interpretations of Vygotsky by representatives of what was termed \"neo-Vygotskian fashions in contemporary psychology\" or \"selective traditions\" in Vygotskian scholarship. Characteristically, the most fashionable \"Vygotskian\" phraseology in wide circulation in Western scholarly and educational discourse—such as the so-called \"zone of proximal development\"—in the critical literature of this period were referred to as \"one of the most used and least understood constructs to appear in contemporary educational literature\", the construct that was \"used as little more than a fashionable alternative to Piagetian terminology or the concept of IQ for describing individual differences in attainment or potential\".\n\nOther authors also suggest clearly distinguishing between Vygotsky's original notion of \"zona blizhaishego razvitiia\" (\"ZBR\") and its later Western superficial interpretations known under the umbrella term, \"zone of proximal development\" (\"ZPD\"). The criticism continued and reached a peak in the 2000s. Most often these critiques address numerous distortions of Vygotsky's ideas, mere \"declarations of faith\", \"versions of Vygotsky\", the \"concepts and inferences curiously attributed to Lev Vygotsky\", \"multiple readings of Vygotsky\", some of which—for instance, \"activity theory\"—are referred to as \"dead end” for cultural-historical psychology and, moreover, for methodological thinking in cultural psychology. \n\nSome publications question \"if anyone actually reads Vygotsky’s words\", whether it is \"too late to understand Vygotsky for the classroom\", and suggest \"turning Vygotsky on his head.\" Inconsistencies, contradictions, and at times fundamental flaws in \"Vygotskian\" literature were revealed in the ocean of critical publications on this subject and are typically associated with—but certainly not limited to—the North American legacy of Michael Cole and James Wertsch and their associates. These criticisms contributed significantly to the increasing awareness of numerous \"challenges of claiming a Vygotskian perspective\".\n\nCritical analysis of Vygotsky's ideas revealed that the alleged \"Vygotsky's theory of play\" never existed as such: instead, it was proposed that \"Vygotsky's brief writings about play do not constitute a theory according to scientific definitions of psychological theory, and would be better acknowledged merely as part of the historical evolution of ideas about children's play. Of greater significance is that the theoretical relevance of Vygotsky's opinion about play can seriously be called into question upon the basis of current research in the area\". In addition, recent studies discuss highly problematic nature of Vygotsky's theorizations from contemporary linguistic standpoint, reveal the author's conceptual flaws and propose alternative sources of inspiration in psycholinguistic research in lieu of Vygotsky's conceptualizations: \"It is shown that some of Vygotsky's observations are problematic but that, even if they are accepted, Vygotsky's theoretical account suffers from fundamental difficulties. Thus the support claimed from Vygotsky in accounts of second language acquisition is misplaced, first because of those difficulties and, second, because many who claim support from Vygotsky, do not need or even use his theory but instead focus their attention on his empirical observations and assume incorrectly that if their own empirical observations match Vygotsky's, then Vygotsky's theory can be accepted\"..\n\nThe revisionist movement in Vygotsky Studies was termed a \"revisionist revolution\" to describe a relatively recent trend that emerged in the 1990s. This trend is typically associated with growing dissatisfaction with the quality and scholarly integrity of available texts of Vygotsky and members of Vygotsky Circle, including their English translations made from largely mistaken, distorted, and even in a few instances falsified Soviet editions, which raises serious concerns about the reliability of Vygotsky's texts available in English. However, unlike critical literature that discusses Western interpretations of Vygotsky's legacy, the target of criticism and the primary object of research in the studies of the revisionist strand are Vygotsky's texts proper: the manuscripts, original lifetime publications, and Vygotsky's posthumous Soviet editions that most often were subsequently uncritically translated into other languages. The revisionist strand is solidly grounded in a series of studies in Vygotsky's archives that uncovered previously unknown and unpublished Vygotsky materials.\n\nThus, some studies of the revisionist strand show that certain phrases, terms, and expressions typically associated with Vygotskian legacy as its core notions and concepts—such as \"cultural-historical psychology\", \"cultural-historical theory\", \"cultural-historical school\", \"higher psychical/mental functions\", \"internalization\", \"zone of proximal development\", etc., -- in fact, either occupy not more than just a few dozen pages within the six-volume collection of Vygotsky’s works, or never even occur in Vygotsky's own writings. Another series of studies revealed the questionable quality of Vygotsky's published texts that, in fact, were never finished and intended for publication by their author, but were nevertheless posthumously published without giving proper editorial acknowledgement of their unfinished, transitory nature, and with numerous editorial interventions and distortions of Vygotsky's text. Another series of publications reveals that another well-known Vygotsky's text that is often presented as the foundational work was back-translated into Russian from an English translation of a lost original and passed for the original Vygotsky's writing. This episode was referred to as \"benign forgery\".\n\nScholars associated with the revisionist movement in Vygotsky Studies propose returning to Vygotsky's original uncensored works, critically revising the available discourse, and republishing them in both Russian and translation with a rigorous scholarly commentary. Therefore, an essential part of this revisionist strand is the ongoing work on \"\"PsyAnima\" Complete Vygotsky\" project that for the first time ever exposes full collections of Vygotsky's texts, uncensored and cleared from numerous mistakes, omissions, insertions, and blatant distortions and falsifications of the author's text made in Soviet editions and uncritically transferred in virtually all foreign translated editions of Vygotsky's works. This project is carried out by an international team of volunteers—researchers, archival workers, and library staff—from Belarus, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, and Switzerland, who joined their efforts and put together a collection of L. S. Vygotsky’s texts. This publication work is supported by a stream of critical scholarly studies and publications on textology, history, theory and methodology of Vygotskian research that cumulatively contributes to the first ever edition of \"The Complete Works of L.S. Vygotsky\".\n\n\n\n\nPrimary\n\nSecondary\n\n"}

{"id": "3832640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3832640", "title": "Localism (politics)", "text": "Localism (politics)\n\nLocalism describes a range of political philosophies which prioritize the local. Generally, localism supports local production and consumption of goods, local control of government, and promotion of local history, local culture and local identity. Localism can be contrasted with regionalism and centralized government, with its opposite being found in the unitary state.\n\nLocalism can also refer to a systematic approach to organizing a national government so that local autonomy is retained rather than following the usual pattern of government and political power becoming centralized over time.\n\nOn a conceptual level, there are important affinities between localism and deliberative democracy. This concerns mainly the democratic goal of engaging citizens in decisions that affect them. Consequently, localism will encourage stronger democratic and political participatory forums and widening public sphere connectivity.\n\nLocalists assert that throughout the world's history, most social and economic institutions have been scaled at the local level, as opposed to regional, interregional, or global (basically until the late 19th to the early 20th centuries). Only with imperialism and the industrial revolution did local scales become less central. Most proponents of localism position themselves as defending aspects of this earlier way of life; the phrase \"relocalization\" is often used in this sense. \n\nIn the 20th century, localism drew heavily on the writings of Leopold Kohr, E.F. Schumacher, Wendell Berry, and Kirkpatrick Sale, among others. More generally, localism draws on a wide range of movements and concerns and it proposes that by re-localizing democratic and economic relationships to the local level, social, economic and environmental problems will be more definable and solutions more easily created. They include anarchism, bioregionalism, environmentalism, the Greens, and more specific concerns about food, monetary policy and education. Political parties of all persuasions have also occasionally favored the devolution of power to local authorities. In this vein Alan Milburn, a Labour Party MP, has spoken of \"making services more locally accountable, devolving more power to local communities and, in the process, forging a modern relationship between the state, citizens and services\"\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, a particularly visible strain of localism in the United States was a movement started by Alice Waters to buy locally produced products. This movement originated with organic farming and likely gained impetus because of growing dissatisfaction with organic certification and the failing economic model of industrial agriculture for small farmers. While the advocates of local consumption draw on protectionist arguments, they also appealed primarily to an environmental argument: that pollution caused by transporting goods was a major externality in a global economy, and one that \"localvores\" could greatly diminish. Also, environmental issues can be addressed when decision making power is held by those affected by the issues instead of power sources that do not understand the needs of local communities.\n\nLocalism as a philosophy is related to the principle of subsidiarity.\n\nIn the early 21st century, localists have frequently found themselves aligned with critics of globalisation. Variants of localism are prevalent within the Green movement. According to an article in \"International Socialism\", localism of this sort seeks to \"answer to the problems created by globalisation\" with \"calls to minimise international trade and to seek to establish economies based on ‘local’ self-sufficiency only.\"\n\nSome localists believe that society should be organised politically along community lines, with each community being free to conduct its own business in whatever fashion its people see fit. The size of the communities is defined such that their members are both familiar and dependent on each other, a size something along the lines of a small town or village.\n\nIn reference to localism, Edward Goldsmith, former editor of \"The Ecologist\" magazine, claims: \"The problems facing the world today can only be solved by restoring the functioning of those natural systems which once satisfied our needs, i.e. by fully exploiting those incomparable resources which are individual people, families, communities and ecosystems, which together make up the biosphere or real world\"\n\nTip O'Neill, a longtime Speaker of the House in the US Congress, once famously declared that \"All politics is local\". He eventually wrote a book by that name: \"All Politics Is Local: And Other Rules of the Game\".\n\nThere are discussions whether localism correlates with populism in theory basis. Wayne Yeung, a writer in an online publication (NEW BLOOM) She made an assumption claiming that localism is a sub-school of European-American populism, and its ideology is a combination of ultra-nationalist, anti-leftist, and immigrant-bashing rhetoric. She raised an example of localism application, in which localism certify a “civic” or “cultural” value rather than ethnic understanding in Hong Kong identity politics. Consequently, localism contains elements of populism, primarily as being a politicised form of racism. \n\nJane Wills, a Professor of Human Geography in the University of Exeter, argued that the increasing numbers of populist politicians are endorsing localism as the framework for public policy. She defined that populism is the form of politics that involves actions to speak for the people in a register that is more authentic to the experiences and needs of those people. In other words, most likely that Populist Party policies would contradict with parties supporting the elites. She also used anti-politics to describe populist or localist politician because they stood against mainstream politics. She used the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) as an example where UKIP adopted localism into frame working their policies. Mainstream politicians from Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat threatened by the rise of UKIP and their adoption on localism policy, in which they increasingly exposed from the emotional connection to the people.\n\nMany localists are concerned with the problems of the development of the Third World. Many advocate that third world countries should aim to rely on their own goods and services to escape from what they see are the unfair trade relations with the developed world. George Monbiot claims this idea does not recognise the fact that, even if Third World countries often get a raw deal in trade relations, refusing to trade at all would be a significant blow, as the countries need the revenue generated by trade.\n\nSome localists are also against immigration from poor countries to rich ones. One of the problems they claim results from such immigration is the drain on the intellectual resources of poor countries, so called brain drain. For example, in the past decade, Bulgaria is estimated to have lost more than 50,000 qualified scientists and skilled workers through emigration every year. About a fifth of them were highly educated specialists in chemistry, biology, medicine and physics.\n\nSome localists are against political intervention and peace keeping measures. They believe that communities should find solutions to their own problems and in their own time, in whatever fashion they decide. They believe that all societies are capable of achieving long term peace once given the opportunity to do so.\n\nLocalism usually describes social measures or trends which emphasise or value local and small-scale phenomena. This is in contrast to large, all-encompassing frameworks for action or belief. Localism can therefore be contrasted with globalisation, and in some cases localist activism has parallels with opposition to corporate-led globalization. Localism can be geographical, but there are also transnational linkages. Localist movements are often organized in support of locally owned, independent businesses and nonprofit organizations. Although the focus of this aspect of localist activism is on \"buy local,\" \"support local food,\" and \"bank local\" campaigns, some organizations and businesses also combine the goal of increased local ownership with environmental sustainability and social fairness goals.\n\nExamples of localism are:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "157430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=157430", "title": "Mormonism and polygamy", "text": "Mormonism and polygamy\n\nPolygamy (called plural marriage by Mormons in the 19th century or the Principle by modern fundamentalist practitioners of polygamy) was practiced by leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church or Mormons) for more than half of the 19th century, and practiced publicly from 1852 to 1890 by between 20 and 30 percent of Latter-day Saint families. \n\nThe Latter-day Saints' practice of polygamy has been controversial, both within Western society and the LDS Church itself. America was both fascinated and horrified by the practice of polygamy, with the Republican platform at one time referencing \"the twin relics of barbarism—polygamy and slavery.\" The private practice of polygamy was instituted in the 1830s by founder Joseph Smith. The public practice of plural marriage by the church was announced and defended in 1852 by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Orson Pratt, by the request of church president Brigham Young.\n\nFor over 60 years, the LDS Church and the United States were at odds over the issue: the church defended the practice as a matter of religious freedom, while the federal government aggressively sought to eradicate it, consistent with prevailing public opinion. Polygamy was probably a significant factor in the Utah War of 1857 and 1858, given the Republican attempts to paint Democratic President James Buchanan as weak in his opposition to both polygamy and slavery. In 1862, the United States Congress passed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, which prohibited plural marriage in the territories. In spite of the law, Mormons continued to practice polygamy, believing that it was protected by the First Amendment. In 1879, in \"Reynolds v. United States\", the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Morrill Act, stating: \"Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinion, they may with practices.\"\n\nIn 1890, church president Wilford Woodruff issued a Manifesto that officially terminated the practice of polygamy. Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. After the Manifesto, some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president Joseph F. Smith disavowed polygamy before Congress and issued a \"Second Manifesto\", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease and established excommunication as the consequence for those who disobeyed. Several small \"fundamentalist\" groups, seeking to continue the practice, split from the LDS Church, including the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB) and the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church). Meanwhile, the LDS Church continues its policy of excommunicating members found practicing polygamy, and today actively seeks to distance itself from fundamentalist groups that continue the practice. On its web site, the church states that \"the standard doctrine of the church is monogamy\" and that polygamy was a temporary exception to the rule.\n\nMany early converts to the religion including Brigham Young, Orson Pratt, and Lyman Johnson, recorded that Joseph Smith was teaching plural marriage privately as early as 1831 or 1832. Pratt reported that Smith told some early members in 1831 and 1832 that plural marriage was a true principle, but that the time to practice it had not yet come. Johnson also claimed to have heard the doctrine from Smith in 1831. Mosiah Hancock reported that his father was taught about plural marriage in the spring of 1832.\n\nThe 1835 and 1844 versions of the church's Doctrine and Covenants (D&C) prohibited polygamy and declared that monogamy was the only acceptable form of marriage:\n\nWilliam Clayton, Smith's scribe, recorded early polygamous marriages in 1843, including unions between Smith and Eliza Partridge, Emily Partridge, Sarah Ann Whitney, Helen Kimball and Flora Woodworth. Clayton relates: \"On the 1st day of May, 1843, I officiated in the office of an Elder by marrying Lucy Walker to the Prophet Joseph Smith, at his own residence. During this period the Prophet Joseph took several other wives. Amongst the number I well remember Eliza Partridge, Emily Partridge, Sarah Ann Whitney, Helen Kimball and Flora Woodworth. These all, he acknowledged to me, were his lawful, wedded wives, according to the celestial order. His wife Emma was cognizant of the fact of some, if not all, of these being his wives, and she generally treated them very kindly.\"\n\nAs early as 1832, Mormon missionaries worked successfully to convert followers in Maine of polygamist religious leader Jacob Cochran, who went into hiding in 1830 to escape imprisonment due to his practice of polygamy. Among Cochran's marital innovations was \"spiritual wifery\", and \"tradition assumes that he received frequent consignments of spiritual consorts, and that such were invariably the most robust and attractive women in the community\". The majority of what became the Quorum of the Twelve in 1835 attended Mormon conferences held in the center of the Cochranites in 1834 and 1835. Brigham Young, an apostle of the church, became acquainted with Cochran's followers as he made several missionary journeys through the Cochranite territory from Boston to Saco, and later married Augusta Adams Cobb, a former Cochranite.\n\nJoseph Smith publicly condemned polygamy, denied his involvement in it, and participants were excommunicated, as church records and publications reflect. But church leaders nevertheless began practicing polygamy in the 1840s, particularly members of the Quorum of the Twelve. Sidney Rigdon, while he was estranged from the church, wrote a letter in backlash to the \"Messenger and Advocate\" in 1844 condemning the church's Quorum of the Twelve and their alleged connection to polygamy:\n\nAt the time, the practice was kept secret from non-members and most church members. Throughout his life, Smith publicly denied having multiple wives.\n\nHowever, John C. Bennett, a recent convert to the church and the first mayor of Nauvoo, used ideas of eternal and plural marriage to justify acts of seduction, adultery and, in some cases, the practice of abortion in the guise of \"spiritual wifery\". Bennett was called to account by Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and was excommunicated from the church. In April 1844, Joseph Smith referred to polygamy as \"John C. Bennett's spiritual wife system\" and warned \"if any man writes to you, or preaches to you, doctrines contrary to the Bible, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Doctrine and Covenants, set him down as an imposter.\" Smith mused \n\nThe practice was publicly announced in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, in 1852, some five years after the Mormons arrived in Utah, and eight years after Smith's death. The doctrine authorizing plural marriage was published in the 1876 version of the LDS Church's Doctrine and Covenants.\n\nTop leaders used the examples of the polygamy of God the Father and Jesus Christ in defense of it and these teachings on God and Jesus' polygamy were widely accepted among Mormons by the late-1850s. In 1853 Jedediah Grant who later become a First Presidency member stated that the top reason behind the persecution of Christ and his disciples was their due to their practice of polygamy. Two months later the apostle Orson Pratt taught in an official church periodical that \"We have now clearly shown that God the Father had a plurality of wives,\" and that after her death, Mary (the mother of Jesus) may have become another eternal polygamous wife of God. He also stated that Christ had multiple wives as further evidence in defense of polygamy. In the next two years the apostle Orson Hyde also stated during two general conference addresses that Jesus practiced polygamy and repeated this in an 1857 address. This teaching was alluded to by church president Brigham Young in 1870 and then First Presidency member Joseph F. Smith in 1883.\n\nThe 1843 polygamy revelation, published posthumously, counseled Smith's wife Emma to accept all of Smith's plural wives, and warns of destruction if the new covenant is not observed. Emma Smith was publicly and privately opposed to the practice and Joseph may have married some women without Emma knowing beforehand. Emma publicly denied that her husband had ever preached or practiced polygamy, which later became a defining difference between the LDS Church under Brigham Young and the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church; now known as the Community of Christ), led by Joseph Smith III. Emma Smith remained affiliated with the RLDS Church until her death at the age of 74. Emma Smith claimed that the very first time she ever became aware of the 1843 polygamy revelation was when she read about it in Orson Pratt's publication \"The Seer\" in 1853.\n\nThere is a subtle difference between \"sealing\" (which is a Mormon priesthood ordinance that binds individuals together in the eternities), and \"marriage\" (a social tradition in which the man and woman agree to be husband and wife in this life). In the early days of Mormonism, common practices and doctrines were not yet well-defined. Even among those who accept the views of conventional historians, there is disagreement as to the precise number of wives Smith had: Fawn M. Brodie lists 48, D. Michael Quinn 46, and George D. Smith 38. The discrepancy is created by the lack of documents to support the alleged marriages to some of the named wives.\n\nA number of Smith's \"marriages\" occurred after his death, with the wife being sealed to Smith via a proxy who stood in for him. One historian, Todd M. Compton, documented at least 33 plural marriages or sealings during Smith's lifetime. Richard Lloyd Anderson and Scott H. Faulring came up with a list of 29 wives of Joseph Smith.\n\nIt is unclear how many of the wives Smith had sexual relations with. Many contemporary accounts from Smith's time indicate that he engaged in sexual relations with several of his wives. , there are at least twelve early Latter Day Saints who, based on historical documents and circumstantial evidence, have been identified as potential Smith offspring stemming from plural marriages. In 2005 and 2007 studies, a geneticist with the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation, a scientific organization founded by LDS Church member James L. Sorenson in association with Professor Scott R. Woodward of Brigham Young University (a private university owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints), stated that they had shown \"with 99.9 percent accuracy\" that five of these individuals were in fact not Smith descendants: Mosiah Hancock (son of Clarissa Reed Hancock), Oliver Buell (son of Prescindia Huntington Buell), Moroni Llewellyn Pratt (son of Mary Ann Frost Pratt), Zebulon Jacobs (son of Zina Diantha Huntington Jacobs Smith), and Orrison Smith (son of Fanny Alger). The remaining seven have yet to be conclusively tested, including Josephine Lyon, for whom current DNA testing using mitochondrial DNA cannot provide conclusive evidence either way. Lyon's mother, Sylvia Sessions Lyon, left her daughter a deathbed affidavit telling her she was Smith's daughter.\n\nLDS Church president Brigham Young had 51 wives, and 56 children by 16 of those wives.\n\nLDS Church apostle Heber C. Kimball had 43 wives, and had 65 children by 17 of those wives.\n\nAs the LDS Church settled in what became the Utah Territory, it eventually was subjected to the power and opinion of the United States. Friction first began to show in the James Buchanan administration and federal troops arrived (see Utah War). Buchanan, anticipating Mormon opposition to a newly appointed territorial governor to replace Brigham Young, dispatched 2,500 federal troops to Utah to seat the new governor, thus setting in motion a series of misunderstandings in which the Mormons felt threatened.\n\nFor the most part, the rest of the United States considered plural marriage offensive. On July 8, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act into law, which forbade the practice in U.S. territories. Lincoln made a statement that he had no intentions of enforcing it if the LDS Church would not interfere with him, and so the matter was laid to rest for a time. But rhetoric continued, and polygamy became an impediment to Utah being admitted as a state. Brigham Young preached in 1866 that if Utah will not be admitted to the Union until it abandons polygamy, \"we shall never be admitted.\"\n\nAfter the Civil War, immigrants to Utah who were not members of the church continued the contest for political power. They were frustrated by the consolidation of the members. Forming the Liberal Party, non-Mormons began pushing for political changes and sought to weaken the church's dominance in the territory. In September 1871, Young was indicted for adultery due to his plural marriages. On January 6, 1879, the Supreme Court upheld the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act in \"Reynolds v. United States\".\n\nIn February 1882, George Q. Cannon, a prominent leader in the church, was denied a non-voting seat in the U.S. House of Representatives due to his polygamous relations. This revived the issue of polygamy in national politics. One month later, the Edmunds Act was passed by Congress, amending the Morrill Act and made polygamy a felony punishable by a $500 fine and five years in prison. \"Unlawful cohabitation\", in which the prosecution did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), was a misdemeanor punishable by a $300 fine and six months imprisonment. It also revoked the right of polygamists to vote or hold office and allowed them to be punished without due process. Even if people did not practice polygamy, they would have their rights revoked if they confessed a belief in it. In August, Rudger Clawson was imprisoned for continuing to cohabit with wives that he married before the 1862 Morrill Act.\n\nIn 1887, the Edmunds–Tucker Act allowed the disincorporation of the LDS Church and the seizure of church property; it also further extended the punishments of the Edmunds Act. In July of the same year, the U.S. Attorney General filed suit to seize all church assets.\n\nThe church was losing control of the territorial government, and many members and leaders were being actively pursued as fugitives. Without being able to appear publicly, the leadership was left to navigate \"underground\".\n\nFollowing the passage of the Edmunds–Tucker Act, the church found it difficult to operate as a viable institution. After visiting priesthood leaders in many settlements, church president Wilford Woodruff left for San Francisco on September 3, 1890, to meet with prominent businessmen and politicians. He returned to Salt Lake City on September 21, determined to obtain divine confirmation to pursue a course that seemed to be agonizingly more and more clear. As he explained to church members a year later, the choice was between, on the one hand, continuing to practice plural marriage and thereby losing the temples, \"stopping all the ordinances therein,\" and, on the other, ceasing plural marriage in order to continue performing the essential ordinances for the living and the dead. Woodruff hastened to add that he had acted only as the Lord directed: \n\nThe final element in Woodruff's revelatory experience came on the evening of September 23, 1890. The following morning, he reported to some of the general authorities that he had struggled throughout the night with the Lord regarding the path that should be pursued. The result was a 510-word handwritten manuscript which stated his intentions to comply with the law and denied that the church continued to solemnize or condone plural marriages. The document was later edited by George Q. Cannon of the First Presidency and others to its present 356 words. On October 6, 1890, it was presented to the Latter-day Saints at the General Conference and unanimously approved.\n\nWhile many church leaders in 1890 regarded the Manifesto as inspired, there were differences among them about its scope and permanence. Contemporary opinions include the contention that the manifesto was more related to an effort to achieve statehood for the Utah territory. Some leaders were reluctant to terminate a long-standing practice that was regarded as divinely mandated. As a result, over 200 plural marriages were performed between 1890 and 1904.\n\nIt was not until 1904, under the leadership of church president Joseph F. Smith, that the church completely banned new plural marriages worldwide. Not surprisingly, rumors persisted of marriages performed after the 1890 Manifesto, and beginning in January 1904, testimony given in the Smoot hearings made it clear that plural marriage had not been completely extinguished.\n\nThe ambiguity was ended in the General Conference of April 1904, when Smith issued the \"Second Manifesto\", an emphatic declaration that prohibited plural marriage and proclaimed that offenders would be subject to church discipline. It declared that any who participated in additional plural marriages, and those officiating, would be excommunicated from the church. Those disagreeing with the Second Manifesto included apostles Matthias F. Cowley and John W. Taylor, who both resigned from the Quorum of the Twelve. Cowley retained his membership in the church, but Taylor was later excommunicated.\n\nAlthough the Second Manifesto ended the official practice of new plural marriages, existing plural marriages were not automatically dissolved. Many Mormons, including prominent church leaders, maintained existing plural marriages into the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nIn 1943, the First Presidency learned that apostle Richard R. Lyman was cohabitating with a woman other than his legal wife. As it turned out, in 1925 Lyman had begun a relationship which he defined as a polygamous marriage. Unable to trust anyone else to officiate, Lyman and the woman exchanged vows secretly. By 1943, both were in their seventies. Lyman was excommunicated on November 12, 1943, at age 73. The Quorum of the Twelve provided the newspapers with a one-sentence announcement, stating that the ground for excommunication was violation of the law of chastity.\n\nOver time, many of those who rejected the LDS Church's relinquishment of plural marriage formed small, close-knit communities in areas of the Rocky Mountains. These groups continue to practice \"the Principle\". In the 1940s, LDS Church apostle Mark E. Petersen coined the term \"Mormon fundamentalist\" to describe such people. Fundamentalists either practice as individuals, as families, or as part of organized denominations. Today, the LDS Church objects to the use of the term \"Mormon fundamentalists\" and suggests using the term \"polygamist sects\" to avoid confusion about whether the main body of Mormon believers teach or practice polygamy.\n\nMormon fundamentalists believe that plural marriage is a requirement for exaltation and entry into the highest level of the celestial kingdom. These beliefs stem from statements by 19th-century Mormon authorities including Brigham Young (although some of these leaders gave possibly conflicting statements that a monogamist may obtain at least a lower degree of \"exaltation\" through mere \"belief\" in polygamy).\n\nFor public relations reasons, the LDS Church has sought vigorously to disassociate itself from Mormon fundamentalists and the practice of plural marriage. Although the LDS Church has requested that journalists not refer to Mormon fundamentalists using the term \"Mormon\", journalists generally have not complied, and \"Mormon fundamentalist\" has become standard terminology. Mormon fundamentalists themselves embrace the term \"Mormon\" and share a religious heritage and beliefs with the LDS Church, including canonization of the Book of Mormon and a claim that Joseph Smith is the founder of their religion.\n\nAlthough the LDS Church has abandoned the practice of plural marriage, it has not abandoned the underlying doctrines of polygamy. According to the church's sacred texts and pronouncements by its leaders and theologians, the church leaves open the possibility that it may one day re-institute the practice. It is still the practice of monogamous Mormon couples to be sealed to one another. However, in some circumstances, men and women may be sealed to multiple spouses. Most commonly, a man may be sealed to multiple wives: if his first wife dies, he may be sealed to a second wife. A deceased woman may also be sealed to multiple men, but only through vicarious sealing if they are also deceased.\n\nAs early as the publication of the Book of Mormon in 1830, Latter Day Saint doctrine maintained that polygamy was allowable only if it was commanded by God. The Book of Jacob condemned polygamy as adultery, but left open the proviso that \"For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise, they shall hearken unto these things.\" Thus, the LDS Church today teaches that plural marriage can only be practiced when specifically authorized by God. According to this view, the 1890 Manifesto and Second Manifesto rescinded God's prior authorization given to Joseph Smith.\n\nHowever, Bruce R. McConkie controversially stated in his 1958 book, \"Mormon Doctrine\", that God will \"obviously\" re-institute the practice of polygamy after the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. This echoes earlier teachings by Brigham Young that the primary purpose of polygamy was to bring about the Millennium. Current official church materials do not make any mention of the future re-institution of plural marriage.\n\nIn the case where a man's first wife dies, and the man remarries, and both of the marriages involve a sealing, LDS authorities teach that in the afterlife, the man will enter a polygamous relationship with both wives. Apostle Dallin Oaks is an example of such a case.\n\nUnder LDS Church policy, a man whose sealed wife has died does not have to request any permission beyond having a current temple recommend and an interview with his bishop to get final permission for a living ordinance, to be married in the temple and sealed to another woman, unless the new wife's circumstance requires a cancellation of sealing. However, a woman whose sealed husband has died is still bound by the original sealing and must request a cancellation of sealing to be sealed to another man (see next paragraph for exception to this after she dies). In some cases, women in this situation who wish to remarry choose to be married to subsequent husbands in the temple \"for time only\", and are not sealed to them, leaving them sealed to their first husband for eternity.\n\nAs of 1998, however, women who have died may be sealed to more than one man. In 1998, the LDS Church created a new policy that a woman may also be sealed to more than one man. A woman, however, may not be sealed to more than one man while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after both she and her husband(s) have died. Thus, if a widow who was sealed to her first husband remarries, she may be sealed by proxy to all of her subsequent husband(s), but only after both she and the subsequent husbands have died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely \"offered\" to the person in the afterlife, indicating that the purpose is to allow the woman to choose the right man to be sealed to. \n\nA man who is sealed to a woman but later divorced must apply for a \"sealing clearance\" from the First Presidency in order to be sealed to another woman. Receiving clearance does not void or invalidate the first sealing. A woman in the same circumstances would apply to the First Presidency for a \"cancellation of sealing\" (sometimes called a \"temple divorce\"), allowing her to be sealed to another man. This approval voids the original sealing as far as the woman is concerned. Divorced women who have not applied for a sealing cancellation are considered sealed to the original husband. However, it is generally believed that even in the afterlife the marriage relationship is voluntary, so no person could be forced into an eternal relationship through temple sealing that they do not wish to be in. Divorced women may also be granted a cancellation of sealing, even though they do not intend to marry someone else. In this case, they are no longer regarded as being sealed to anyone and are presumed to have the same eternal status as unwed women.\n\nAccording to church policy, after a man has died, he may be sealed by proxy to all of the women to whom he was legally married while he was alive. The same is true for women; however, if a woman was sealed to a man while she was alive, all of her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed by proxy to them.\n\nChurch doctrine is not entirely specific on the status of men or women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. There are at least two possibilities:\n\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that plural marriages produced unhappiness in some wives. LDS historian Todd Compton, in his book \"In Sacred Loneliness\", described various instances where some wives in polygamous marriages were unhappy with polygamy.\n\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that church leaders established the practice of polygamy in order to further their immoral desires for sexual gratification with multiple sexual partners. Critics point to the fact that church leaders practiced polygamy in secret from 1833 to 1852, despite a written church doctrine (Doctrine and Covenants 101, 1835 edition) renouncing polygamy and stating that only monogamous marriages were permitted. Critics also cite several first-person accounts of early church leaders attempting to use the polygamy doctrine to enter into illicit relationships with women. Critics also assert that Joseph Smith instituted polygamy in order to cover up an 1835 adulterous affair with a neighbor's daughter, Fanny Alger, by taking Alger as his second wife. Compton dates this marriage to March or April 1833, well before Joseph was accused of an affair. However, historian Lawrence Foster dismisses the marriage of Alger to Joseph Smith as \"debatable supposition\" rather than \"established fact\".\n\nOthers conclude that many Latter-day Saints entered into plural marriage based on the belief that it was a religious commandment, rather than as an excuse for sexual license. For instance, many of the figures who came to be best associated with plural marriage, including church president Brigham Young and his counselor Heber C. Kimball, expressed revulsion at the system when it was first introduced to them. Young famously stated that after receiving the commandment to practice plural marriage in Nauvoo, he saw a funeral procession walking down the street and he wished he could exchange places with the corpse. He recalled that \"I was not desirous of shrinking from any duty, nor of failing in the least to do as I was commanded, but it was the first time in my life that I had desired the grave, and I could hardly get over it for a long time.\" When Kimball first heard of the principle, he believed that he would marry elderly women whom he would care for and who would not be a threat to his first wife Vilate. He was later shocked to learn that he was to marry a younger woman. His biographer writes that he \"became sick in body, but his mental wretchedness was too great to allow of his retiring, and he would walk the floor till nearly morning, and sometimes the agony of his mind was so terrible that he would wring his hands and weep like a child\". While his wife Vilate had trials \"grievous to bear\" as a result of her acceptance of plural marriage, she supported her husband in his religious duties, and taught her children that \"she could not doubt the plural order of marriage was of God, for the Lord had revealed it to her in answer to prayer.\"\n\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that church leaders sometimes used polygamy to take advantage of young girls for immoral purposes. Historian George D. Smith studied 153 men who took plural wives in the early years of the Latter Day Saint movement, and found that two of the girls were thirteen years old, 13 girls were fourteen years old, 21 were fifteen years old, and 53 were sixteen years old. Historian Todd Compton documented that Joseph Smith married girls of age 13 or 14. Historian Stanly Hirshon documented cases of girls aged 10 and 11 being married to old men.\n\nHowever, it seems that Brigham Young attempted to stamp out the practice of men being sealed to excessively young girls. In 1857, he stated, \"I shall not seal the people as I have done. Old Father Alread brought three young girls 12 & 13 years old. I would not seal them to him. They would not be equally yoked together ... Many get their endowments who are not worthy and this is the way that devils are made.\"\nAs the type of polygamy practiced is primarily polygyny, critics of the early LDS Church argue that polygamy may have caused a shortage of brides in the early LDS community, citing quotes by church leader Heber C. Kimball who is purported to have said (addressing departing missionaries): \n\nOn another occasion, he said \"You are sent out as shepherds to gather sheep together; and remember that they are not your sheep ... do not make selections before they are brought home and put into the fold.\"\n\nThe first quote above is not attested in any Mormon source, but first appeared in a derisive article in the \"New York Times\" on May 15, 1860. FairMormon, an LDS apologetics organization, considers the \"prettiest women\" statement to be apocryphal, but that it may be a paraphrase of Kimball's \"Journal of Discourses\" statement, which is authentic.\n\nIn the paragraph immediately following the above quote, Kimball said:\n\nThe precise number who participated in plural marriage is not known, but studies indicate a maximum of 20 to 25 percent of Latter-day Saint adults were members of polygamist households. One third of the women of marriageable age and nearly all of the church leadership were involved in the practice.\n\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church have documented several cases where deception and coercion were used to induce marriage, for example citing the case of Joseph Smith who warned some potential spouses of eternal damnation if they did not consent to be his wife. In 1893, married LDS Church member John D. Miles traveled to England and proposed to Caroline Owens, assuring her that he was not polygamous. She returned to Utah and participated in a wedding, only to find out after the ceremony that Miles was already married. She ran away, but Miles hunted her down and raped her. She eventually escaped, and filed a lawsuit against Miles that reached the Supreme Court and became a significant case in polygamy case law. Ann Eliza Young, nineteenth wife of Brigham Young, claimed that Young coerced her to marry him by threatening financial ruin of her brother.\n\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that polygamy was used to justify marriage of close relatives that would otherwise be considered immoral. In 1843, Joseph Smith's diary records the sealing of John Milton Bernhisel to his sister, Maria, in a ceremony that included the sealing of Bernhisel to multiple relatives, some of whom were deceased. However, this is understood by most scholars as the collective sealing or binding of the family and not a marriage between Bernhisel and his sister. Similar family sealings are practiced in Latter-Day Saint temples today, where children of parents who were not sealed at the time of their marriage are sealed to their parents and to one another in a group ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This title, comparable with \"Huangdi Neijing\" 黃帝內經 \"Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon\", is generally interpreted as a \"chart\" or \"diagram\" of \"inner\" \"meridians\" or \"channels\" for circulating \"qi\" in \"neidan\" practices.\n\nEnglish translations of \"Neijing tu\" include:\n\n\"Neijing tu\" 內經圖 has an alternate writing of \"Neijing tu\" 內景圖 \"Diagram of Interior Lights\" (Kohn 2000:499, 521), using \"jing\" \"view; scenery; condition\" as a variant Chinese character for \"jing\" 經.\n\nWhile the original \"Neijing tu\" provenance is unclear, it probably dates from the 19th century (Komjathy 2004:11). All received copies derive from an engraved stele dated 1886 in Beijing's White Cloud Temple 白雲觀 that records how Liu Chengyin 柳誠印 based it on an old silk scroll discovered in a library on Mount Song (in Henan). In addition, a Qing Dynasty colored scroll \"Neijing tu\" was painted at the Ruyi Guan 如意館 \"Palace of Fulfilled Wishes\" library in the Forbidden City (Despeux 2008:767).\n\nThe \"Neijing Tu\" was the precursor for the \"Xiuzhen Tu\" 修真圖 \"Cultivating Perfection Diagram\".

Joseph Needham (1983:114) coins the term \"microsomography\" and describes the \"Neijing tu\" as \"much more fanciful and poetical\" than previous Daoist illustrations.\n\nThe textual descriptions include names of \"zangfu\" organs, two poems attributed to Lü Dongbin 呂洞賓 (born ca. 798 CE, one of the Eight Immortals), and quotations from the \"Huangting jing\" 黃庭經 \"Yellow Court Scripture\".\n\nThe \"Neijing\" image of a mountain with crags on the skull and spinal column elaborates upon the \"body-as-mountain\" metaphor, first recorded in 1227 CE (Despeux and Kohn 2003:185).

{"id": "367280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367280", "title": "Origin of the Romanians", "text": "Origin of the Romanians\n\nSeveral theories address the issue of the origin of the Romanians. The Romanian language descends from the Vulgar Latin dialects spoken in the Roman provinces north of the \"Jireček Line\" (a proposed notional line separating the predominantly Latin-speaking territories from the Greek-speaking lands in Southeastern Europe) in Late Antiquity. The theory of Daco-Roman continuity argues that the Romanians are mainly descended from the Daco-Romans, a people developing through the cohabitation of the native Dacians and the Roman colonists in the province of Dacia Traiana (primarily in present-day Romania) north of the river Danube. The competing immigrationist theory states that the Romanians' ethnogenesis commenced in the provinces south of the river with Romanized local populations (known as Vlachs in the Middle Ages) spreading through mountain refuges, both south to Greece and north through the Carpathian Mountains. According to the \"admigration theory\", migrations from the Balkan Peninsula to the lands north of the Danube contributed to the survival of a Romance-speaking population in those territories.\n\nPolitical motivationsthe Transylvanian Romanians' efforts to achieve their emancipation, Austro-Hungarian and Romanian expansionism, and Hungarian irredentisminfluenced the development of the theories, and \"national passions\" still color the debates. In 2013, authors of \"The Cambridge History of the Romance Languages\" came to the conclusion that the \"historical, archaeological and linguistic data available do not seem adequate to give a definitive answer\" in the debate. Their view was accepted by scholars contributing to \"The Oxford Guide to the Romance Languages\", published in 2016, which concludes that \"the location and extent of the territory where \"Daco-Romance\" originated\" is uncertain.\n\nThree major ethnic groupsthe Dacians, Illyrians and Thraciansinhabited the northern regions of Southeastern Europe in Antiquity. Modern knowledge of their languages is based on limited evidence (primarily on proper names), making all scholarly theories proposing a strong relationship between the three languages or between Thracian and Dacian speculative. The Illyrians were the first to be conquered by the Romans, who organized their territory into the province of Illyricum around 60 BC. In the lands inhabited by Thracians, the Romans set up the province of Moesia in 6 AD, and Thracia forty years later. Present-day Dobruja was attached to Moesia in 46. The Romans annihilated the Dacian kingdom to the north of the Lower Danube under Emperor Trajan in 106. Its western territories were organized into the province of Dacia (or \"Dacia Traiana\"), but Maramureș and further regions inhabited by the Costoboci, Bastarnae and other tribes remained free of Roman rule. The Romans officially abandoned Dacia under Emperor Aurelian (\"r.\" 270–275), who organized a new province bearing the same name (\"Dacia Aureliana\") south of the Lower Danube. Although Roman forts were erected north of the Danube in the 320s, the river became the boundary between the empire and the Goths in the 360s.\n\nMeanwhile, from 313 under the Edict of Milan, the Roman Empire began to transform itself into a Christian state. Roman emperors supported Christian missionaries in the lands dominated by the Goths from the 340s. The Huns destroyed all these territories between 376 and 406, but their empire also collapsed in 453. Thereafter the Gepids dominated Banat, Crișana, and Transylvania. The Bulgars, Antes, Sclavenes and other tribes made frequent raids across the Lower Danube against the Balkans in the 6th century. The Roman Empire revived under Emperor Justinian I (\"r.\" 527–565), but the Avars, who had subjugated the Gepids, invaded the Balkans from the 580s. In 30 years all Roman troops were withdrawn from the peninsula, where only Dyrrhachium, Thessaloniki and a few other towns remained under Roman rule.\n\nThe next arrivals, the Bulgars, established their own state on the Lower Danube in 681. Their territorial expansion accelerated after the collapse of the Avar Khaganate in the 790s. The ruler of the First Bulgarian Empire, Boris I (\"r.\" 852–889) converted to Christianity in 864. A synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church promoted a liturgy in Old Church Slavonic in 893. Bulgaria was invaded by the Magyars (or Hungarians) in 894, but a joint counter-attack by the Bulgars and the Pechenegsa nomadic Turkic peopleforced the Magyars to find a new homeland in the Carpathian Basin. Historians still debate whether they encountered a Romanian population in the territory. The Byzantines occupied the greater part of Bulgaria under Emperor John I Tzimiskes (\"r.\" 969–976). The Bulgars regained their independence during the reign of Samuel (\"r.\" 997–1014), but Emperor Basil II of Byzantium conquered their country around 1018.\n\nThe first bishop consecrated for the Hungarians was a Greek from Constantinople, but their supreme ruler, Stephen, was baptized according to the Western rite. Crowned the first king of Hungary in 1000 or 1001, he expanded his rule over new territories, including Banat. Pecheneg groups, pushed by the Ouzesa coalition of Turkic nomadssought asylum in the Byzantine Empire in the 1040s. After the Ouzes there followed the Cumansalso a Turkic confederationwho took control of the Pontic steppes in the 1070s. Thereafter, specific groups, including the Hungarian-speaking Székelys and the Pechenegs, defended the frontiers of the Kingdom of Hungary against them. The arrival of mostly German-speaking colonists in the 1150s also reinforced the Hungarian monarch's rule in the region.\n\nThe Byzantine authorities introduced new taxes, provoking an uprising in the Balkan Mountains in 1185. The local Bulgarians and Vlachs achieved their independence and established the Second Bulgarian Empire in coalition with the Cumans. A chieftain of the western Cuman tribes accepted Hungarian supremacy in 1227. The Hungarian expansion towards the Pontic steppes was halted by the large Mongol campaign against Eastern and Central Europe in 1241. Although the Mongols withdrew in a year, their invasion caused destruction throughout the region.\n\nThe unification of small polities ruled by local Romanian leaders in Oltenia and Muntenia led to the establishment of a new principality, Wallachia. It achieved independence under Basarab the Founder, who defeated a Hungarian army in the battle of Posada in 1330. A second principality, Moldavia, became independent in the 1360s under Bogdan I, a Romanian nobleman from Maramureș.\n\nOne of the first scholars who systematically studied the Romance languages, Friedrich Christian Diez, described Romanian as a semi-Romance language in the 1830s. In 2009, Kim Schulte likewise argued that \"Romanian is a language with a hybrid vocabulary\". The proportion of loanwords in Romanian is indeed higher than in other Romance languages. Its certain structural featuressuch as the construction of the future tensealso distinguish Romanian from other Romance languages. The same peculiarities connect it to Albanian, Bulgarian and other tongues spoken in the Balkan Peninsula. Nevertheless, as linguist Graham Mallinson emphasizes, Romanian \"retains enough of its Latin heritage at all linguistic levels to qualify for membership of the Romance family in its own right\", even without taking into account the \"re-Romancing tendency\" during its recent history. The core vocabulary is to a large degree Latin, including the most frequently used 2500 words. Around one-fifth of the entries of the 1958 edition of the \"Dictionary of the Modern Romanian\" have directly been inherited from Latin. More than 75% of the words in the semantic fields of sense perception, quantity, kinship and spatial relations are of Latin origin, but the basic lexicons of religion and of agriculture have also been preserved. \n\nRomanians, known by the exonym Vlachs in the Middle Ages, speak a language descended from the Vulgar Latin that was once spoken in south-eastern Europe. Inscriptions from the Roman period prove that a line, known as the \"Jireček Line\", can be drawn through the Balkan Peninsula, which separated the Latin-speaking northern provinces, including Dacia, Moesia and Pannonia from the southern regions where Greek remained the predominant language. Eastern Romance now has four variants, which are former dialects of a Proto-Romanian language. Daco-Romanian, the official language of Romania, is the most widespread of the four variants. Speakers of the Aromanian language live in scattered communities in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece and Macedonia. Another two, by now nearly extinct variants, Megleno-Romanian and Istro-Romanian, are spoken in some villages in Macedonia and Greece, and in Croatia, respectively. Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian are spoken in the central and southern regions of the Balkans, indicating that they migrated to these territories in the Middle Ages. Some variants of the Eastern Romance languages retained more elements of their Latin heritage than others.\n\nThe territories south of the Danube were subject to the Romanization process for about 800 years, while Dacia province to the north of the river was only for 165 years under Roman rule, which caused \"a certain disaccord between the effective process of Roman expansion and Romanization and the present ethnic configuration of Southeastern Europe\", according to Lucian Boia. Political and ideological considerations, including the dispute between Hungary and Romania over Transylvania, have also colored these scholarly discussions. Accordingly, theories on the Romanian \"Urheimat\" or \"homeland\" can be divided into two or more groups, including the theory of Daco-Roman continuity of the continuous presence of the Romanians' ancestors in the lands north of the Lower Danube and the opposite immigrationist theory. Independently of the theories, a number of scholars propose that Romanian developed from the tongue of a bilingual population, because bilingualism is the most probable explanation for its peculiarities.\n\nByzantine authors were the first to write of the Romanians (or Vlachs). The 11th-century scholar Kekaumenos wrote of a Vlach homeland situated \"near the Danube and [...] the Sava, where the Serbians lived more recently\". He associates the Vlachs with the Dacians and the Bessi and with the Dacian king Decebal. Accordingly, historians have located this homeland in several places, including Pannonia Inferior (Bogdan Petriceicu Hașdeu) and \"Dacia Aureliana\" (Gottfried Schramm). When associating the Vlachs with ancient ethnic groups, Kekaumenos followed the the practice of Byzantine authors who named contemporary peoples for peoples known from ancient sources. The 12th-century scholar John Kinnamos wrote that the Vlachs \"are said to be formerly colonists from the people of Italy\". William of Rubruck wrote that the Vlachs of Bulgaria descended from the \"Ulac\" people, who lived beyond Bashkiria. Rubruck's words imply that he regarded the Vlachs a migrant population, coming from the region of the Volga like their Hungarian and Bulgarian neighbors. The late 13th-century Hungarian chronicler Simon of Kéza states that the Vlachs used to be the Romans' \"shepherds and husbandmen\" who \"elected to remain behind in Pannonia\" when the Huns arrived. An unknown author's \"Description of Eastern Europe\" from 1308 likewise states that the Balkan Vlachs \"were once the shepherds of the Romans\" who \"had over them ten powerful kings in the entire Messia and Pannonia\".\n\nPoggio Bracciolini, an Italian scholar was the first to write (around 1450) that the Romanians' ancestors had been Roman colonists settled in Dacia Traiana. In 1458, Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini stated in his work \"De Europa\" (1458) that the Vlachs were a \"genus Italicum\" (\"an Italian race\") and were named after one Pomponius Flaccus, a commander sent against the Dacians. Piccolomini's version of the Vlachs' origin from Roman settlers in Dacia Traiana was repeated by many scholarsincluding the Italian Flavio Biondo and Pietro Ranzano, the Transylvanian Saxon Johannes Lebelius and the Hungarian Stephan Szántóin the subsequent century. On the other hand, Laonikos Chalkokondylesa late-15th-century Byzantine scholarstated that he never heard anyone \"explain clearly where\" the Romanians \"came from to inhabit\" their lands. Chalkokondyles also wrote that the Romanians were said to have come \"from many places and settled that area\". The 17th-century Johannes Lucius expressed his concerns about the survival of Romans in the territory of the former Dacia Traiana province, exposed to invasions for a millennium.\n\nA legend on the origin of the Moldavians, preserved in the \"Moldo-Russian Chronicle\" from around 1505, narrates that one \"King Vladislav of Hungary\" invited their Romanian ancestors to his kingdom and settled them \"in Maramureş between the \"Moreş\" and Tisa at a place called \"Crij\"\". \"Logofăt\" Istratie and other 17th-century Moldavian historians continued to credit \"King Vladislav\" with the settlement of the Romanians' ancestors in Maramureş. Grigore Ureche's \"Chronicle of Moldavia\" of 1647 is the first Romanian historical work stating that the Romanians \"all come from \"Rîm\"\" (Rome). In 30 years Miron Costin explicitly connected the Romanians' ethnogenesis to the conquest of \"Dacia Traiana\". Constantin Cantacuzino stated in 1716 that the native Dacians also had a role in the formation of the Romanian people. Petru Maior and other historians of the \"Transylvanian School\" flatly denied any interbreeding between the natives and the conquerors, claiming that the autochthonous Dacian population which was not eradicated by the Romans fled the territory. The Daco-Roman mixing became widely accepted in the Romanian historiography around 1800. This view is advocated by the Greek-origin historians Dimitrie Philippide (in his 1816 work \"History of Romania\") and Dionisie Fotino, who wrote \"History of Dacia\" (1818). The idea was accepted and taught in the Habsburg Monarchy, including Hungary until the 1870s, although the Austrian Franz Joseph Sulzer had by the 1780s rejected any form of continuity north of the Danube, and instead proposed a 13th-century migration from the Balkans.\n\nThe development of the theories was closely connected to political debates in the . Sulzer's theory of the Romanians' migration was apparently connected to his plans on the annexation of Wallachia and Moldavia by the Habsburg Monarchy, and the settlement of German colonists in both principalities. The three political \"nations\" of the Principality of Transylvania (the Hungarians, Saxons and Székelys) enjoyed special privileges, while local legislation emphasized that the Romanians had been \"admitted into the country for the public good\" and they were only \"tolerated for the benefit of the country\". When suggesting that the Romanians of Transylvania were the direct descendants of the Roman colonists in Emperor Trajan's Dacia, the historians of the \"Transylvanian School\" also demanded that the Romanians were to be regarded as the oldest residents of the country. The \"Supplex Libellus Valachorum\"a petition completed by the representatives of the local Romanians in 1791explicitly demanded that the Romanians should be granted the same legal status that the three privileged \"nations\" had enjoyed because the Romanians were of Roman stock.\n\nScholars supporting the continuity theory argue that the Romanians descended primarily from the inhabitants of \"Dacia Traiana\", the province encompassing three or four regions of present-day Romania to the north of the Lower Danube from 106. In these scholars' view, the close contacts between the autochthonous Dacians and the Roman colonists led to the formation of the Romanian people because masses of provincials stayed behind after the Roman Empire abandoned the province in the early 270s. Thereafter the process of Romanization expanded to the neighboring regions due to the free movement of people across the former imperial borders. The spread of Christianity contributed to the process, since Latin was the language of liturgy among the Daco-Romans. The Romans held bridgeheads norths of the Lower Danube, keeping Dacia within their sphere of influence uninterruptedly until 376. Proponents of the theory argues that the north-Danubian regions remained the main \"center of Romanization\" after the Slavs started assimilating the Latin-speaking population in the lands south of the river, or forcing them to move even further south in the 7th century. Although for a millennium migratory peoples invaded the territory, a sedentary Christian Romance-speaking population survived, primarily in the densely forested areas, separated from the \"heretic\" or pagan invaders. Only the \"semisedentarian\" Slavs exerted some influence on the Romanians' ancestors, especially after they adopted Orthodox Christianity in the 9th century. They played the role in the Romanians' ethnogenesis that the Germanic peoples had played in the formation of other Romance peoples.\n\nHistorians who accept the continuity theory emphasize that the Romanians \"form the numerically largest people\" in southeastern Europe. Romanian ethnographers point at the \"striking similarities\" between the traditional Romanian folk dress and the Dacian dress depicted on Trajan's Column as a clear evidence for the connection between the ancient Dacians and modern Romanians. They also highlight the importance of the massive and organized colonization of Dacia Traiana. One of them, Coriolan H. Opreanu underlines that \"nowhere else has anyone defied reason by stating that a [Romance] people, twice as numerous as any of its neighbours..., is only accidentally inhabiting the territory of a former Roman province, once home to a numerous and strongly Romanized population\". With the colonists coming from many provinces and living side by side with the natives, Latin must have emerged as their common language. The Dacians willingly adopted the conquerors' superior culture and they spoke Latin as native tongue after two or three generations. Estimating the provincials' number at 500,000-1,000,000 in the 270s, supporters of the continuity theory rule out the possibility that masses of Latin-speaking commoners abandoned the province when the Roman troops and officials left it. Historian Ioan-Aurel Pop concludes that the relocation of hundreds of thousands of people across the Lower Danube in a short period was impossible, especially because the commoners were unwilling to \"move to foreign places, where they had nothing of their own and where the lands were already occupied.\" Romanian historians also argue that Roman sources failed to mention that the whole population was moved from Dacia Traiana. \n\nMost Romanian scholars accepting the continuity theory regard the archaeological evidence for the uninterrupted presence of a Romanized population in the lands now forming Romania undeniable. Especially, artefacts bearing Christian symbolism, hoards of bronze Roman coins and Roman-style pottery are listed among the archaeological finds verifying the theory. The same scholars emphasize that the Romanians directly inherited the basic Christian terminology from Latin, which also substantiates the connection between Christian objects and the Romanians' ancestors. Other scholars who support the same theory underline that the connection between certain artefacts or archaeological assemblages and ethnic groups is uncertain. Instead of archaeological evidence, Alexandru Madgearu highlights the importance of the linguistic traces of continuity, referring to the Romanian river names in the Apuseni Mountains and the preservation of archaic Latin lexical elements in the local dialect. The survival of the names of the largest rivers from Antiquity is often cited as an evidence for the continuity theory, although some linguists who support it notes that a Slavic-speaking population transmitted them to modern Romanians. Some words directly inherited from Latin are also said to prove the continuous presence of the Romanians' ancestors north of the Danube, because they refer to things closely connected to these regions. For instance, linguists Grigore Nandriș and Marius Sala argue that the Latin words for natural oil, gold and bison could only be preserved in the lands to the north of the river.\n\nWritten sources did not mention the Romanians, either those who lived north of the Lower Danube or those living to the south of the river, for centuries. Scholars supporting the continuity theory notes that the silence of sources does not contradict it, because early medieval authors named the foreign lands and their inhabitants after the ruling peoples. Hence, they mentioned Gothia, Hunia, Gepidia, Avaria, Patzinakia and Cumania, and wrote of Goths, Huns, Gepids, Avars, Pechenegs and Cumans, without revealing the multi-ethnic character of these realms. References to the \"Volokhi\" in the \"Russian Primary Chronicle\", and to the \"Blakumen\" in Scandinavian sources are often listed as the first records of north-Danubian Romanians. The \"Gesta Hungarorum\"the oldest extant Hungarian chroniclementioned the Vlachs and the \"shepherds of the Romans\" (along with the Bulgarians, Slavs, Greeks and other peoples) among the inhabitants of the Carpathian Basin at the time of the arrival of the Magyars (or Hungarians) in the late 9th century; Simon of Kéza's later Hungarian chronicle identified the Vlachs as the \"Romans shepherds and husbandman\" who remained in Pannonia. Pop concludes that the two chronicles \"assert the Roman origin of Romanians... by presenting them as the Romans' descendants\" who stayed in the former Roman provinces.\n\nScholars who support the immigrationist theory propose that the Romanians descended from the Romanized inhabitants of the provinces to the south of the Danube. Following the collapse of the empire's frontiers around 620, some of this population moved south to regions where Latin had not been widely spoken. Others took refuge in the Balkan Mountains where they adopted an itinerant form of sheep- and goat-breeding, giving rise to the modern Vlach shepherds. Their mobile lifestyle contributed to their spread in the mountainous zones. The start of their northward migration cannot exactly be dated, but they did not settle in the lands north to the Lower Danube before the end of the 10th century and they crossed the Carpathians after the mid-12th century.\n\nImmigrationist scholars emphasize that all other Romance languages developed in regions which had been under Roman rule for more than 500 years and nothing suggests that Romanian was an exception. Even in Britain, where the Roman rule lasted for 365 years (more than twice as long as in Dacia Traiana) the pre-Roman languages survived. Proponents of the theory have not developed a consensual view about the Dacians' fate after the Roman conquest, but they agree that the presence of a non-Romanized rural population (either the remnants of the local Dacians, or immigrant tribesmen) in Dacia Traiana is well-documented. The same scholars find it hard to believe that the Romanized elements preferred to stay behind when the Roman authorities announced the withdrawal of the troops from the province and offered the civilians to also move to the Balkans. Furthermore, the Romans had started fleeing from Dacia Traiana decades before it was abandoned.\n\nAlmost no place name has been preserved in the former province (while more than twenty settlements still bear a name of Roman origin in England). The present forms of the few river names inherited from Antiquity show that non-Latin-speaking populationsDacians and Slavsmediated them to the modern inhabitants of the region. Both literary sources and archaeological finds confirm this conjecture: the presence of Carpians, Vandals, Taifals, Goths, Gepids, Huns, Slavs, Avars, Bulgarians and Hungarians in the former Roman province in the early Middle Ages is well documented. Sporadic references to few Latin-speaking individualsmerchants and prisoners of waramong the Huns and Gepids in the 5th century does not contradict this picture. Since Eastern Germanic peoples inhabited the lands to the north of the Lower Danube for more than 300 years, the lack of loanwords borrowed from them also indicates that the Romanians' homeland was located in other regions. Likewise, no early borrowings from Eastern or Western Slavic languages can be proven, although the Romanians' ancestors should have had much contact with Eastern and Western Slavs to the north of the Danube.\n\nImmigrationist scholars underline that the population of the Roman provinces to the south of the Danube was \"thoroughly Latinized\". Romanian has common features with idioms spoken in the Balkans (especially with Albanian and Bulgarian), suggesting that these languages developed side by side for centuries. Southern Slavic loanwords also abound in Romanian. Literary sources attest the presence of significant Romance-speaking groups in the Balkans (especially in the mountainous regions) in the Middle Ages. Dozens of place names of Romanian origin can still be detected in the same territory. The Romanians became Orthodox Christians and adopted Old Church Slavonic as liturgical language, which could hardly happen in the lands to the north of the Danube after 864 (when Boris I of Bulgaria converted to Christianity). Early medieval documents unanimously describe the Vlachs as a mobile pastoralist population. Slavic and Hungarian loanwords also evince that the Romanians' ancestors adopted a settled way of life only at a later phase of their ethnogenesis.\n\nReliable sources refer to the Romanians' presence in the lands to the north of the Danube for the first time in the 1160s. No place names of Romanian origin were recorded where early medieval settlements existed in this area. Here, the Romanians adopted Hungarian, Slavic and German toponyms, also indicating that they arrived after the Saxons settled in southern Transylvania in the mid-12th century. The Romanians initially formed scattered communities in the Southern Carpathians, but their northward expansion is well-documented from the second half of the 13th century. Both the monarchs and individual landowners (including Roman Catholic prelates) promoted their immigration, because the Romanian sheep-herders strengthened the defense of the borderlands and colonised areas which could not be brought into agricultural cultivation. The Romanians adopted a sedentary way of life after they started settling on the edge of lowland villages in the mid-14th century. Their immigration continued during the following centuries and they gradually took possession of the settlements in the plains which had been depopulated by frequent incursions.\n\nAccording to the \"admigration theory\", proposed by Dimitrie Onciul, the formation of the Romanian people occurred in the former \"Dacia Traiana\" province, and in the central regions of the Balkan Peninsula. However, the Balkan Vlachs' northward migration ensured that these centers remained in close contact for centuries. It's a compromise between immigrationist and continuity theories.\n\nIn the 5th century BC, Herodotus was the first author to write a detailed account of the natives of south-eastern Europe. In connection with a Persian campaign in 514 BC, he mentions the Getae, which he called \"the most courageous and upright Thracian tribe\". Strabo wrote that the language of the Dacians was \"the same as that of the Getae\".\n\nLiterary tradition on the conquest of Dacia was preserved by 3-4 Roman scholars. Cassius Dio wrote that \"numerous Dacians kept transferring their allegiance\" to Emperor Trajan before he commenced his war against Decebal. Lucian of Samosata, Eutropius, and Julian the Apostate unanimously attest the memory of a \"deliberate ethnic cleansing\" that followed the fall of the Dacian state. For instance, Lucian of Samosata who cites Emperor Trajan's physician Criton of Heraclea states that the entire Dacian \"people was reduced to forty men\". In fact, Thracian or possibly Dacian names represent about 2% of the approximately 3,000 proper names known from \"Dacia Traiana\". Bitus, Dezibalos and other characteristic Dacian names were only recorded in the empire's other territories, including Egypt and Italy. Constantin Daicoviciu, Dumitru Protase, Dan Ruscu and other historians have debated the validity of the tradition of the Dacians' extermination. They state that it only refers to the men's fate or comes from Eutropius's writings to provide an acceptable explanation for the massive colonisation that followed the conquest. Indeed, Eutropius also reported that Emperor Trajan transferred to the new province \"vast numbers of people from all over the Roman world\". Onosmatic evidence substantiates his words: about 2,000 Latin, 420 Greek, 120 Illyrian, and 70 Celtic names are known from the Roman period.\n\nBarbarian attacks against \"Dacia Traiana\" were also recorded. For instance, \"an inroad of the Carpi\" forced Emperor Galerius's mother to flee from the province in the 240s. Aurelius Victor, Eutropius and Festus stated that Dacia \"was lost\" under Emperor Gallienus (\"r.\" 253268). The \"Augustan History\" and Jordanes refer to the Roman withdrawal from the province in the early 270s. The \"Augustan History\" says that Emperor Aurelian \"led away both soldiers and provincials\" from Dacia in order to repopulate Illyricum and Moesia.\n\nIn less than a century, the one-time province was named \"Gothia\", by authors including the 4th-century Orosius. The existence of Christian communities in Gothia is attested by the \"Passion\" of Sabbas, \"a Goth by race\" and by the martyrologies of Wereka and Batwin, and other Gothic Christians. Large number of Goths, Taifali, and according to Zosimus \"other tribes that formerly dwelt among them\" were admitted into the Eastern Roman Empire following the invasion of the Huns in 376. In contrast with these peoples, the Carpo-Dacians \"were mixed with the Huns\". Priscus of Panium, who visited the Hunnic Empire in 448, wrote that the empire's inhabitants spoke either Hunnic or Gothic, and that those who had \"commercial dealings with the western Romans\" also spoke Latin. He also mentions the local name of two drinks, \"medos\" and \"kam\". Emperor Diocletian's \"Edict on Prices\" states that the Pannonians had a drink named \"kamos\". \"Medos\" may have also been an Illyrian term, but a Germanic explanation cannot be excluded.\n\nThe 6th-century author Jordanes who called Dacia \"Gepidia\" was the first to write of the Antes and Slavenes. He wrote that the Slavenes occupied the region \"from the city of Noviodunum and the lake called Mursianus\" to the river Dniester, and that the Antes dwelled \"in the curve of the sea of Pontus\". Procopius wrote that the Antes and the Slaveni spoke \"the same language, an utterly barbarous tongue\". He also writes of an Antian who \"spoke in the Latin tongue\". The late 7th-century author Ananias of Shirak wrote in his geography that the Slavs inhabited the \"large country of Dacia\" and formed 25 tribes. In 2001, Florin Curta argues, that the Slaveni ethnonym may have only been used \"as an umbrella-term for various groups living north of the Danube frontier, which were neither 'Antes', nor 'Huns' or 'Avars'\".\n\nThe Ravenna Geographer wrote about a Dacia \"populated by the [...] Avars\", but written sources from the 9th and 10th centuries are scarce. The \"Royal Frankish Annals\" refers to the Abodrites living \"in Dacia on the Danube as neighbors of the Bulgars\" around 824. The \"Bavarian Geographer\" locates the \"Merehanii\" next to the Bulgars. By contrast, Alfred the Great wrote of \"Dacians, who were formerly Goths\", living to the south-east of the \"Vistula country\" in his abridged translation (\"ca\". 890) of Paulus Orosius' much earlier work \"Historiae Adversus Paganos\" written around 417. Emperor Constantine VII's \"De Administrando Imperio\" contains the most detailed information on the history of the region in the first decades of the 10th century. It reveals that \"Patzinakia\", the Pechenegs' land was bordered by Bulgaria on the Lower Danube around 950, and the Hungarians lived on the rivers Criş, Mureş, Timiş, Tisa and \"Toutis\" at the same time. That the Pechenegs's land was located next to Bulgaria is confirmed by the contemporary Abraham ben Jacob.\n\nThe \"Gesta Hungarorum\" from around 1150 or 1200 is the first chronicle to write of Vlachs in the intra-Carpathian regions. Its anonymous author stated that the Hungarians encountered \"Slavs, Bulgarians, Vlachs, and the shepherds of the Romans\" when invading the Carpathian Basin around 895. He also wrote of Gelou, \"a certain Vlach\" ruling Transylvania, a land inhabited by \"Vlachs and Slavs\". In his study on medieval Hungarian chronicles, Carlile Aylmer Macartney concluded that the \"Gesta Hungarorum\" did not prove the presence of Romanians in the territory, since its author's \"manner is much rather that of a romantic novelist than a historian\". In contrast, Alexandru Madgearu, in his monography dedicated to the \"Gesta\", stated that this chronicle \"is generally credible\", since its narration can be \"confirmed by the archaeological evidence or by comparison with other written sources\" in many cases.\n\nThe late 12th-century chronicle of Niketas Choniates contains another early reference to Vlachs living north of the Danube. He wrote that they seized the future Byzantine emperor, Andronikos Komnenos when \"he reached the borders of Halych\" in 1164. Thereafter, information on Vlachs from the territory of present-day Romania abounds. Choniates mentioned that the Cumans crossed the Lower Danube \"with a division of Vlachs\" from the north to launch a plundering raid against Thrace in 1199. Pope Gregory IX wrote about \"a certain people in the Cumanian bishopric called \"Walati\"\" and their bishops around 1234. A royal charter of 1223 confirming a former grant of land is the earliest official document of Romanians in Transylvania. It refers to the transfer of land previously held by them to the monastery of Cârța, which proves that this territory had been inhabited by Vlachs before the monastery was founded. According to the next document, the Teutonic Knights received the right to pass through the lands possessed by the Székelys and the Vlachs in 1223. Next year the Transylvanian Saxons were entitled to use certain forests together with the Vlachs and Pechenegs. Simon of Kéza knew that the Székelys \"shared with the Vlachs\" the mountains, \"mingling with them\" and allegedly adopting the Vlachs' alphabet.\n\nA charter of 1247 of King Béla IV of Hungary lists small Romanian polities existing north of the Lower Danube. Thomas Tuscus mentioned Vlachs fighting against the Ruthenes in 1276 or 1277. References to Vlachs living in the lands of secular lords and prelates in the Kingdom of Hungary appeared in the 1270s. First the canons of the cathedral chapter in Alba Iulia received a royal authorization to settle Romanians to their domains in 1276. Thereafter, royal charters attest the presence of Romanians in more counties, for instance in Zărand from 1318, in Bihor and in Maramureș from 1326, and in Turda from 1342. The first independent Romanian state, the Principality of Wallachia, was known as \"Oungrovlachia\" (\"Vlachia near Hungary\") in Byzantine sources, while Moldavia received the Greek denominations \"Maurovlachia\" (\"Black Vlachia\") or \"Russovlachia\" (\"Vlachia near Russia\").\n\nThe words \"torna, torna fratre\" recorded in connection with a Roman campaign across the Balkan Mountains by Theophylact Simocatta and Theophanes the Confessor evidence the development of a Romance language in the late 6th century. The words were shouted \"in native parlance\" by a local soldier in 587 or 588. When narrating the rebellion of Kuber and his people against the Avars, the 7th-century \"Miracles of St. Demetrius\" mentions that a close supporter of his, Mauros spoke four languages, including \"our language\" (Greek) and \"that of the Romans\" (Latin). Kuber led a population of mixed originincluding the descendants of Roman provincials who had been captured in the Balkans in the early 7th centuryfrom the region of Sirmium to Thessaloniki around 681.\n\nJohn Skylitzes's chronicle contains one of the earliest records on the Balkan Vlachs. He mentions that \"some vagabond Vlachs\" killed David, one of the four Cometopuli brothers between Kastoria and Prespa in 976. After the Byzantine occupation of Bulgaria, Emperor Basil II set up the autocephalous Archbishopric of Ohrid with the right from 1020 to collect income \"from the Vlachs in the whole of \"theme\" of Bulgaria\". The late 11th-century Kekaumenos relates that the Vlachs of the region of Larissa had \"the custom of having their herds and families stay in high mountains and other really cold places from the month of April to the month of September\". A passing remark by Anna Comnena reveals that nomads of the Balkans were \"commonly called Vlachs\" around 1100. Occasionally, the Balkan Vlachs cooperated with the Cumans against the Byzantine Empire, for instance by showing them \"the way through the passes\" of the Stara Planina in the 1090s.\n\nMost information on the 1185 uprising of the Bulgars and Vlachs and the subsequent establishment of the Second Bulgarian Empire is based on Niketas Choniates's chronicle. He states that it was \"the rustling of their cattle\" which provoked the Vlachs to rebel against the imperial government. Besides him, Ansbert, and a number of other contemporary sources refer to the Vlach origin of the Asen brothers who initiated the revolt. The Vlachs' pre-eminent role in the Second Bulgarian Empire is demonstrated by \"Blacia\", and other similar denominations under which the new state was mentioned in contemporary sources. The \"Annales Florolivienses\", the first such source, mentions the route of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa \"through Hungary, Russia, Cumania, \"Vlakhia\", Durazzo, Byzantium and Turkey\" during his crusade of 1189. Pope Innocent III used the terms \"Vlachia and Bulgaria\" jointly when referring to the whole territory of the Second Bulgarian Empire. Similarly, the chronicler Geoffrey of Villehardouin refers to the Bulgarian ruler Kaloyan as \"Johanitsa, the king of Vlachia and Bulgaria\". The Icelandic author Snorri Sturluson mentioned the Balkan Vlachs' territory as \"Blokumannaland\" in his early 13th-century text \"Heimskringla\". William of Rubruck distinguished Bulgaria from \"Blakia\". He stated that \"Bulgaria, \"Blakia\" and Slavonia were provinces of the Greeks\", implying that his \"Blakia\" was also located south of the Danube. Likewise, the \"Vlach lands\" mentioned in the works of Abulfeda, Ibn Khaldun and other medieval Muslim authors are identical with Bulgaria.\n\nThe 10th-century Muslim scholars, Al-Muqaddasi and Ibn al-Nadim mentioned the \"Waladj\" and the \"Blaghā\", respectively in their lists of peoples. The lists also refer to the Khazars, Alans, and Greeks, and it is possible that the two ethnonyms refer to Vlachs dwelling somewhere in south-eastern Europe. For instance, historian Alexandru Madgearu says that Al-Muqaddasi's work is the first reference to Romanians living north of the Danube. Victor Spinei writes that a runestone which was set up around 1050 contains the earliest reference to Romanians living east of the Carpathians. It refers to \"Blakumen\" who killed a Varangian merchant at an unspecified place. The 11th-century Persan writer, Gardizi, wrote about a Christian people called \"N.n.d.r\" inhabiting the lands along the Danube. Historian Adolf Armbruster identified this people as Vlachs. In Hungarian, the Bulgarians were called \"Nándor\" in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe \"Russian Primary Chronicle\" from 1113 contains possible references to Vlachs in the Carpathian Basin. It relates how the \"Volokhi\" seized \"the territory of the Slavs\" and were expelled by the Hungarians. Therefore, the Slavs' presence antedates the arrival of the \"Volokhi\" in the chronicle's narration. Madgearu and many other historians argue that the \"Volokhi\" are Vlachs, but the \"Volokhi\" have also been identified with either Romans or Franks annexing Pannonia (for instance, by Lubor Niederle and by Dennis Deletant respectively).\n\nThe poem \"Nibelungenlied\" from the early 1200s mentions one \"duke Ramunc of Wallachia\" in the retinue of Attila the Hun. The poem alludes to the Vlachs along with the Russians, Greeks, Poles and Pechenegs, and may refer to a \"Wallachia\" east of the Carpathians. The identification of the Vlachs and the \"Bolokhoveni\" of the \"Hypatian Chronicle\" whose land bordered on the Principality of Halych is not unanimously accepted by historians (for instance, Victor Spinei refuses it).\n\n\"Tumuli\" erected for a cremation rite appeared in Oltenia and in Transylvania around 100 BC, thus preceding the emergence of the Dacian kingdom. Their rich inventory has analogies in archaeological sites south of the Danube. Although only around 300 graves from the next three centuries have been unearthed in Romania, they represent multiple burial rites, including \"ustrinum\" cremation and inhumation. New villages in the Mureș valley prove a demographic growth in the 1st century BC. Fortified settlements were erected on hilltops, mainly in the Orăştie Mountains, but open villages remained the most common type of settlement. In contrast with the finds of 25,000 Roman \"denarii\" and their local copies, imported products were virtually missing in Dacia. The interpretations of Geto-Dacian archaeological findings are problematic because they may be still influenced by methodological nationalism.\n\nThe conquering Romans destroyed all fortresses and the main Dacian sanctuaries around 106 AD. All villages disappeared because of the demolition. Roman settlements built on the location of former Dacian ones have not been identified yet. However, the rural communities at Boarta, Cernat, and other places used \"both traditional and Roman items\", even thereafter. Objects representing local traditions have been unearthed at Roman villas in Aiudul de Sus, Deva and other places as well. A feature of the few types of native pottery which continued to be produced in Roman times is the \"Dacian cup\", a mostly hand-made mug with a wide rim, which was used even in military centers. The use of a type of tall cooking pot indicates the survival of traditional culinary practices as well.\n\nColonization and the presence of military units gave rise to the emergence of most towns in \"Dacia Traiana\": for instance, Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa was founded for veterans, Apulum and Potaissa started to develop as \"canabae\". Towns were the only places where the presence of Christians can be assumed based on objects bearing Christian symbolism, including a lamp and a cup decorated with crosses, which have been dated to the Roman period. Rural cemeteries characterized by burial rites with analogies in sites east of the Carpathians attest to the presence of immigrant \"barbarian\" communities, for instance, at Obreja and Soporu de Câmpie. Along the northwestern frontiers of the province, \"Przeworsk\" settlements were unearthed at Boineşti, Cehăluţ, and other places.\n\nArchaeological finds suggest that attacks against Roman Dacia became more intensive from the middle of the 3rd century: an inscription from Apulum hails Emperor Decius (\"r.\" 249–251) as the \"restorer of Dacia\"; and coin hoards ending with pieces minted in this period have been found. Inscriptions from the 260s attest that the two Roman legions of Dacia were transferred to Pannonia Superior and Italy. Coins bearing the inscription \"DACIA FELIX\" minted in 271 may reflect that Trajan's Dacia still existed in that year, but they may as well refer to the establishment of the new province of \"Dacia Aureliana\".\n\nThe differentiation of archaeological finds from the periods before and after the Roman withdrawal is not simple, but Archiud, Obreja, and other villages produced finds from both periods. Towns have also yielded evidence on locals staying behind. For instance, in Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegatusa, at least one building was inhabited even in the 4th century, and a local factory continued to produce pottery, although \"in a more restricted range\". Roman coins from the 3rd and 4th centuries, mainly minted in bronze, were found in Banat where small Roman forts were erected in the 290s. Coins minted under Emperor Valentinian I (\"r.\" 364–375) were also found in Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, where the gate of the amphitheater was walled at an uncertain date. A votive plate found near a spring at Biertan bears a Latin inscription dated to the 4th century, and has analogies in objects made in the Roman Empire. Whether this \"donarium\" belonged to a Christian missionary, to a local cleric or layman or to a pagan Goth making an offering at the spring is still debated by archaeologists.\n\nA new cultural synthesis, the \"Sântana de Mureş-Chernyakhov culture\", spread through the plains of Moldavia and Wallachia in the early 4th century. It incorporated elements of the \"Wielbark culture\" of present-day Poland and of local tradition. More than 150 \"Sântana de Mureş-Chernyakhov\" settlements suggest that the territory experienced a demographic growth. Three sites in the Eastern Carpathians already inhabited in the previous century prove the natives' survival as well. Growing popularity of inhumation burials also characterizes the period. \"Sântana de Mureş-Chernyakhov\" cemeteries from the 4th century were also unearthed in Transylvania.\nCoin hoards ending with pieces from the period between 375 and 395 unearthed at Bistreţ, Gherla, and other settlements point to a period of uncertainty. Featuring elements of the \"Przeworsk\" and \"Sântana de Mureş-Chernyakhov\" cultures also disappeared around 400. Archaeological sites from the next centuries have yielded finds indicating the existence of scattered communities bearing different traditions. Again, cremation became the most widespread burial rite east of the Carpathians, where a new type of buildingsunken huts with an oven in the corneralso appeared. The heterogeneous vessel styles were replaced by the more uniform \"Suceava-Şipot\" archaeological horizon of hand made pottery from the 550s.\n\nIn contrast with the regions east of the Carpathians, Transylvania experienced the spread of the \"row grave\" horizon of inhumation necropolises in the 5th century, also known from the same period in Austria, Bohemia, Transdanubia and Thuringia. At the same time, large villages appeared in Crișana and Transylvania, in most cases in places where no earlier habitation has yet been proven. Moreover, imported objects with Christian symbols, including a fish-shaped lamp from Lipova, and a \"Saint Menas flask\" from Moigrad, were unearthed. However, only about 15% of the 30 known \"row grave\" cemeteries survived until the late 7th century. They together form the distinct \"Band-Noşlac\" group of graveyards which also produced weapons and other objects of Western or Byzantine provenance.\n\nThe earliest examples in Transylvania of inhumation graves with a corpse buried, in accordance with nomadic tradition, with remains of a horse were found at Band. The \"Gâmbaş group\" of cemeteries emerged in the same period, producing weapons similar to those found in the Pontic steppes. Sunken huts appeared in the easternmost zones of Transylvania around 7th century. Soon the new horizon of \"Mediaș\" cemeteries, containing primarily cremation graves, spread along the rivers of the region. The \"Nușfalău-Someşeni\" cemeteries likewise follow the cremation rite, but they produced large \"tumuli\" with analogies in the territories east of the Carpathians.\n\nIn the meantime, the \"Suceava-Şipot horizon\" disappeared in Moldavia and Wallachia, and the new \"Dridu culture\" emerged on both sides of the Lower Danube around 700. Thereafter the region again experienced demographic growth. For instance, the number of settlements unearthed in Moldavia grew from about 120 to about 250 from the 9th century to the 11th century. Few graveyards yielding artifacts similar to \"Dridu cemeteries\" were also founded around Alba Iulia in Transylvania. The nearby \"Ciumbrud group\" of necropolises of inhumation graves point at the presence of warriors. However, no early medieval fortresses unearthed in Transylvania, including Cluj-Mănăştur, Dăbâca, and Şirioara, can be definitively dated earlier than the 10th century.\n\nSmall inhumation cemeteries of the \"Cluj group\", characterized by \"partial symbolic horse burials\", appeared at several places in Banat, Crişana, and Transylvania including at Biharia, Cluj and Timişoara around 900. Cauldrons and further featuring items of the \"Saltovo-Mayaki culture\" of the Pontic steppes were unearthed in Alba Iulia, Cenad, Dăbâca, and other settlements. A new custom of placing coins on the eyes of the dead was also introduced around 1000. \"Bijelo Brdo\" cemeteries, a group of large graveyards with close analogies in the whole Carpathian Basin, were unearthed at Deva, Hunedoara and other places. The east–west orientation of their graves may reflect Christian influence, but the following \"Citfalău group\" of huge cemeteries that appeared in royal fortresses around 1100 clearly belong to a Christian population.\n\nRomanian archaeologists propose that a series of archaeological horizons that succeeded each other in the lands north of the Lower Danube in the early Middle Ages support the continuity theory. In their view, archaeological finds at Brateiu (in Transylvania), Ipotești (in Wallachia) and Costișa (in Moldavia) represent the Daco-Roman stage of the Romanians' ethnogenesis which ended in the 6th century. The next (\"Romanic\") stage can be detected through assemblages unearthed in Ipotești, Botoșana, Hansca and other places which were dated to the 7th-8th centuries. Finally, the Dridu culture is said to be the evidence for the \"ancient Romanian\" stage of the formation of the Romanian people. In contrast to these views, Opreanu emphasizes that the principal argument of the hypothesisthe presence of artefacts imported from the Roman Empire and their local copies in allegedly \"Daco-Roman\" or \"Romanic\" assemblagesis not convincing, because close contacts between the empire and the neighboring Slavs and Avars is well-documnted. He also underlines that Dridu culture developed after a \"cultural discontinuity\" that followed the disappearance of the previous horizons. Regarding both the Slavs and Romanians as sedentary populations, Alexandru Madgearu also underlines that the distinction of \"Slavic\" and \"Romanian\" artefacts is difficult, because archaeologists can only state that these artifacts could hardly be used by nomads. He proposes that \"The wheel-made pottery produced on the fast wheel (as opposed to the tournette), which was found in several settlements of the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries, may indicate the continuation of Roman traditions\" in Transylvania.\n\nThomas Nägler proposes that a separate \"Ciugud culture\" represents the Vlach population of southern Transylvania. He also argues that two treasures from Cârțișoara and Făgăraș also point at the presence of Vlachs. Both hoards contain Byzantine coins ending with pieces minted under Emperor John II Komnenos who died in 1143. Tudor Sălăgean proposes that these treasures point at a local elite with \"at least\" economic contacts with the Byzantine Empire. Paul Stephenson argues that Byzantine coins and jewellery from this period, unearthed at many places in Hungary and Romania, are connected to salt trade.\n\nFortified settlements built on hill-tops characterized the landscape in Illyricum before the Roman conquest. In addition, huts built on piles formed villages along the rivers Sava and its tributaries. Roman coins unearthed in the northwestern regions may indicate that trading contacts between the Roman Empire and Illyricum began in the 2nd century BC, but piracy, quite widespread in this period, could also contribute to their cumulation. The first Roman road in the Balkans, the Via Egnatia which linked Thessaloniki with Dyrrhachium was built in 140 BC. Byllis and Dyrrhachium, the earliest Roman colonies were founded a century later. The Romans established a number of colonies for veterans and other towns, including Emona, Siscia, Sirmium and Iovia Botivo, in the next four centuries.\n\nHand-made pottery of local tradition remained popular even after potter's wheel was introduced by the Romans. Likewise, as it is demonstrated by altars dedicated to Illyrian deities at Bihać and Topusko, native cults survived the Roman conquest. Latin inscriptions on stone monuments prove the existence of a native aristocracy in Roman times. Native settlements flourished in the mining districts in Upper Moesia up until the 4th century. Native names and local burial rites only disappeared in these territories in the 3rd century. In contrast, the frontier region along the Lower Danube in Moesia had already in the 1st century AD transformed into \"a secure Roman-only zone\" (Brad Bartel), from where the natives were moved.\n\nEmperors born in Illyricum, a common phenomenon of the period, erected a number of imperial residences at their birthplaces. For instance, a palace was built for Maximianus Herculius near Sirmium, and another for Constantine the Great in Mediana. New buildings, rich burials and late Roman inscriptions show that Horreum Margi, Remesiana, Siscia, Viminacium, and other centers of administration also prospered under these emperors. Archaeological researchincluding the large cemeteries unearthed at Ulpianum and Naissusshows that Christian communities flourished in Pannonia and Moesia from the 4th century. Inscriptions from the 5th century point at Christian communities surviving the destruction brought by the Huns at Naissus, Viminacium and other towns of Upper Moesia. In contrast, \"villae rusticae\" which had been centers of agriculture from the 1st century disappeared around 450. Likewise, forums, well planned streets and other traditional elements of urban architecture ceased to exist. For instance, Sirmium \"disintegrated into small hamlets emerging in urban areas that had not been in use until then\" after 450. New fortified centers developed around newly erected Christian churches in Sirmium, Novae, and many other towns by around 500. In contrast with towns, there are only two archaeological sites from this period identified as rural settlements.\n\nUnder Justinian the walls of Serdica, Ulpianum and many other towns were repaired. He also had hundreds of small forts erected along the Lower Danube, at mountain passes across the Balkan Mountains and around Constantinople. Inside these forts small churches and houses were built. Pollen analysis suggest that the locals cultivated legumes within the walls, but no other trace of agriculture have been identified. They were supplied with grain, wine and oil from distant territories, as it is demonstrated by the great number of amphorae unearthed in these sites which were used to transport these items to the forts. Most Roman towns and forts in the northern parts of the Balkans were destroyed in the 570s or 580s. Although some of them were soon restored, all of them were abandoned, many even \"without any signs of violence\", in the early 7th century.\n\nThe new horizon of \"Komani-Kruja\" cemeteries emerged in the same century. They yielded grave goods with analogies in many other regions, including belt buckles widespread in the whole Mediterranean Basin, rings with Greek inscriptions, pectoral crosses, and weapons similar to \"Late Avar\" items. Most of them are situated in the region of Dyrrhachium, but such cemeteries were also unearthed at Viničani and other settlements along the Via Egnatia. \"Komani-Kruja\" cemeteries ceased to exist in the early 9th century. John Wilkes proposes that they \"most likely\" represent a Romanized population, while Florin Curta emphasizes their Avar features. Archaeological finds connected to a Romance-speaking population have also been searched in the lowlands to the south of the Lower Danube. For instance, Uwe Fiedler mentions that inhumation graves yielding no grave goods from the period between the 680s and the 860s may represent them, although he himself rejects this theory.\n\nThe formation of the Common Romanian language from Vulgar Latin started in the 6th or 7th centuries and was completed in the 8th century. Common Romanian split into four variants (Daco-Romanian, Macedo-Romanian, Megleno-Romanian and Istro-Romanian) during the 10th-12th centuries. Unlike other Romance languages, the Romanian subdialects spoken to the north of the Danube display a \"remarkable unity\". Primarily the use of different words differentiate them, because their phonology is quite uniform. Whether the shepherds seasonal movements between the mountains and the lowlands secured the preservation of language unity, or the levelling effect of migrations gave rise to the development of a uniform idiom, cannot be decided.\n\nThere are around 100 Romanian words with a possible substratum origin, but the language from which they were transferred cannot be determined. Around 30% of these words represent the specific vocabulary of sheep- and goat-breeding. Moreover, about 70 possible substrate words, have Albanian cognates. Romanian, Albanian and other languages sharing some common morphological and syntactic characteristics form together a supposed \"Balkan linguistic union\". These common features include the postposed definite articles and the merger of the dative case and possessive case. Whether they represent a common substrate language, or convergent development is still a matter of debate among linguists.\n\nHundreds of words that have presumably been inherited from Latin can only be traced back to hypotetical Latin words which were reconstructed based on their Romanian form. Words of Latin origin were also borrowed from Slavic languages.\n\nIn addition to words of Latin or of possible substratum origin, loanwords make up more than 40% (according to certain estimations 60-80%) of the Romanian vocabulary. Linguist Gabriela P. Dindelegan underlines that contacts with other peoples has not modified the \"Latin structure of Romanian\" and the \"non-Latin grammatical elements\" borrowed from other languages were \"adapted to and assimilated by the Romance pattern\". No loanwords of East Germanic (Gothic or Gepid) origin have so far been proven. In the Middle Ages, Slavic languages had a substantial influence on Romanian, but a significant number of words were borrowed from Turkic, Hungarian, Greek or German languages.\n\nThe ratio of Slavic loanwords is still about 14%, although a strong \"re-latinization\" process has decreased their number since the 19th century. For instance, the number of Slavic borrowings exceeds that of the inherited terms in several semantic fields, including that of the natural environment The names for most species of fish of the Danube and of a number of other animals living in Romania are of Slavic origin. Linguists often attribute the development of about 10 phonological and morphological features of the Romanian language to Slavic influence, but there is no consensual view. For instance, contacts with Slavic-speakers allegedly contributed to the appearance of the semi-vowel [y] before the vowel [e] at the beginning of basic words and to the development of the vocative case in Romanian. Linguist Kim Schulte says, the significant common lexical items and the same morpho-syntactic structures of the Romanian and Bulgarian (and Macedonian) languages \"indicates that there was a high decree of bilingualism in this mixed population\".\n\nAll neighboring peoples adopted a number of Romanian words connected to goat- and sheep-breeding. Romanian loanwords are rare in standard Hungarian, but abound in its Transylvanian dialects. In addition to place names and elements of the Romanian pastoral vocabulary, the Transylvanian Hungarians primarily adopted dozens of Romanian ecclesiastic and political terms to refer to specific Romanian institutions already before the mid-17th centuries. The adoption of the Romanian terminology shows that the traditional Romanian institutions, which followed Byzantine patterns, significantly differed from their Hungarian counterparts.\n\nPlace names provide a significant proportion of modern knowledge of the extinct languages of South-eastern Europe. Drobeta, Napoca, Porolissum, Sarmizegetusa and other settlements in \"Dacia Traiana\" bore names of local origin. Some towns preserved their ancient names in South-eastern Europe up until now, but the names of all Roman settlements attested in Roman Dacia in Antiquity disappeared. The Romans adopted the native names of the main rivers and these names survived the Roman withdrawal. Linguists Oliviu and Nicolae Felecan write that the names were \"uninterruptedly transmitted\" from the Dacians to the Romans, and then to the Dacoromans. Grigore Nandriș states that alone among the rivers in Dacia, the development of the name of the Criş from ancient \"Crisius\" would be in line with the phonetical evolution of Romanian. Domnița Tomescu, Gottfried Schramm and other scholars say, the names of the rivers were preserved through a Slavic mediation. The vowel shift from \"[a]\" to \"[u]\" or \"[o]\" experienced in the case of the rivers Mureş [< \"Maris\"], Olt [< \"Aluta\"], and Someş [< \"Samu(m)\"] is attested in the development of the Slavic languages, but is alien to Romanian and other tongues spoken in their regions. Linguist Marius Sala says that these phonetic changes featured the late phase of the \"Daco-Thracian\" language, so they are \"a conclusive argument\" in favor of the continuity theory. Schramm emphasizes that the \"[ʃ]\" ending of the modern names of the rivers could not be directly inherited from Latin, so they must have been transmitted from the local Dacians through Slavic mediation. Dunărea, the Romanian name of the Danube may have developed from a supposed Geto-Dacian \"*Donaris\" form. However, this form is not attested in written sources. Therefore, it is possible that the Romanians' ancestors in this case also adopted a Slavic name. Based on the Repedea name for the upper course of the Bistrița (both meaning \"quick\"), Nandris writes that translations from Romanian into Slavic could also create Romanian hydronyms.\n\nMore than a dozen of the tributaries of the large rivers had a name with probable Indo-European roots, suggesting a Dacian etymology. The Slavic mediation during the transmission of the names of some of them is obvious. The longer tributaries of the large rivers in Banat, Crişana and Transylvania which run through the most populated areas had modern names of German, Hungarian, Slavic or Turkic origin, which were also adopted by the Romanians. For instance, the tributaries of the Someșul Mic River bear Hungarian or Slavic names, while other tributaries bear local Dacian names. Many of the smallest rivers and streams bear names of Romanian origin.\n\nPlace names of Slavic or Hungarian origin can be found in great number in medieval royal charters pertaining to Banat, Crișana, Maramureș, and Transylvania. The names of Hungarian origin can be also found extensively in Moldavia, as a result of the Hungarian colonists settled during the medieval period. In the mountains between the rivers Arieș and Mureș and in the territory the south of the Târnava Mare River, the Romanians and the Transylvanian Saxons directly (without Hungarian mediation) adopted the Slavic place names. In almost all cases, when parallel Slavic-Hungarian or Slavic-German names are attested, Romanians borrowed the Slavic forms, suggesting a long cohabitation of the Romanians and the Slavs or a close relationship between the two ethnic groups, maybe already before the arrival of the Hungarians.\n\nThe earliest toponym of certain Romanian origin in the same regions (Nucşoara) was recorded in 1359. River names of Slavic origin can also be found in the regions east and south of the Carpathians, where Pecheneg or Cuman river names also abound. On the other hand, the name of the Vlaşca region in Wallachia refers to a Romance-speaking community in Slavic environment.\n\nPlace names of Latin origin abound in the region of Lake Shkodër, along the rivers Drin and Fan and other territories to the north of the Viga Egnatia. Gottfried Schramm argues that the names of at least eight towns in the region, likewise suggest the one-time presence of a Romance speaking population in their vicinity. Romanian place names can still be detected in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro and Serbia. For example, such names are concentrated in the wider region of the river Vlasina both in Bulgaria and Serbia, and in Montenegro and the nearby territories.\n\nThe use of genetic data to supplement traditional disciplines has now become mainstream. Given the palimpsest nature of modern genetic diversity, more direct evidence has been sought from ancient DNA (aDNA) Although data from southeastern Europe is still at an incipient stage, general trends are already evident. For example, it has shown that the Neolithic revolution imparted a major demographic impact throughout Europe, disproving the Mesolithic adaptation scenario in its pure form. In fact, the arrival of Neolithic farmers might have been in at least two \"waves\", as suggested by a study which analysed mtDNA sequences from Romanian Neolithic samples. This study also shows that 'M_NEO' (\"Middle Neolithic populations that lived in what is present-day Romania/Transylvania\") and modern populations from Romania are very close, in contrast with Middle Neolithic and modern populations from Central Europe. However, the samples extracted from Late Bronze Age DNA from Romania are farther from both of the previously mentioned. The authors have stated \"Nevertheless, studies on more individuals are necessary to draw definitive conclusions.\" However, the study performed a \"genetic analysis of a relatively large number of samples of Boian, Zau and Gumelniţa cultures in Romania (n = 41) (M_NEO)\"\n\nAncient DNA study on human fossils found in Costişa, Romania, dating from de Bronze Age shows \"close genetic kinship along the maternal lineage between the three old individuals from Costişa and some individuals found in other archeological sites dated from the Bronze and Iron Age. We also should note that the point mutations analyzed above are also found in Romanian modern population, suggesting that some old individuals from the human populations living on the Romanian land in the Bronze and Iron Age, could participate to a certain extent in the foundation of the Romanian genetic pool.\"\n\nAnother major demographic wave also occurred after 3000 BC from the steppe, postulated to be linked with the expansion of Indo-European languages. Bronze and Iron Age samples from Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, however, suggest that this impact was less significant in Southeastern Europe than areas north of the Carpathians. In fact, in the abovementioned studies, the Bronze and Iron Age Balkan samples do not cluster with modern Balkan groups, but lie between Sardinians and other southwestern European groups, suggesting later phenomena (i.e. in Antiquity, Great Migration Period) caused shifts in population genetic structure. However, aDNA samples from southeastern Europe remain few, and only further sampling will allow a clear and diachronic overview of migratory and demographic trends.\n\nNo detailed analyses exist from the Roman and early medieval periods. Genome-wide analyses of extant populations show that intra-European diversity is a continuum (with the exception of groups like Finns, Sami, Basques and Sardinians). Romanians cluster amidst their Balkan and East European neighbours. However, they generally lie significantly closer to Balkan groups (Serbs, Macedonians, Bulgarians) than to central and eastern Europeans like Hungarians, Czechs, Poles and Ukrainians, and many lie in the center of the Balkan cluster, near Albanians, Greeks, and Bulgarians, while many former Yugoslav populations like Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes may draw closer to central European West Slavs. On autosomal studies, genetic distance of some Romanian samples to some Italians, such as Tuscans, is greater than that of the distance to neighboring Balkan peoples, but can in some cases still be relatively close when considering the overall European population structure; this likely reflects mainly ancient or prehistoric population patterns rather than more recent ties due to linguistic relationships. Geography plays one of the most important roles in determining European population structure.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43350024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43350024", "title": "Orthodox Marxism", "text": "Orthodox Marxism\n\nOrthodox Marxism is the body of Marxist thought that emerged after the death of Karl Marx (1818–1883) and which became the official philosophy of the socialist movement as represented in the Second International until the First World War in 1914. Orthodox Marxism aims to simplify, codify and systematize Marxist method and theory by clarifying the perceived ambiguities and contradictions of classical Marxism.\n\nThe philosophy of orthodox Marxism includes the understanding that material development (advances in technology in the productive forces) is the primary agent of change in the structure of society and of human social relations and that social systems and their relations (e.g. feudalism, capitalism and so on) become contradictory and inefficient as the productive forces develop, which results in some form of social revolution arising in response to the mounting contradictions. This revolutionary change is the vehicle for fundamental society-wide changes and ultimately leads to the emergence of new economic systems.\n\nIn the term orthodox Marxism, the word \"orthodox\" refers to the methods of historical materialism and of dialectical materialism—and not the normative aspects inherent to classical Marxism, without implying dogmatic adherence to the results of Marx's investigations.\n\nThe emergence of orthodox Marxism is associated with the latter works of Friedrich Engels, such as the \"Dialectics of Nature\" and \"\", which were efforts to popularise the work of Karl Marx, render it systematic and apply it to the fundamental questions of philosophy. Daniel De Leon, an early American socialist leader, contributed much to the thought during the final years of the 19th century and the early 20th century. Orthodox Marxism was further developed during the Second International by thinkers such as Georgi Plekhanov and Karl Kautsky. Kautsky and to a lesser extent Plekhanov were in turn major influences on Vladimir Lenin, whose version of Marxism was known as Leninism by its contemporaries. The official thought of the Third International was based in orthodox Marxism combined with Leninist views on revolutionary organization. The terms dialectical materialism and historical materialism are associated with this phase of orthodox Marxism. Rosa Luxemburg, Hal Draper and Rudolf Hilferding are prominent thinkers in the orthodox Marxist tradition.\n\nOrthodox Marxism is contrasted with later variations of Marxism, notably revisionism and Leninism. In contrast to Lenin's Bolshevik idea of revolution, orthodox Marxists said that Imperial Russia was too backwards for the development of socialism and would first have undergo a capitalist (bourgeois) phase of development.\n\nThe characteristics of orthodox Marxism are:\n\nOrthodox Marxism is contrasted with revisionist Marxism as developed in post-First World War Social Democratic parties. Some writers also contrast it with Marxism–Leninism as it developed in the Soviet Union, while others describe the latter as firmly within orthodoxy: Orthodox Marxism rested on and grew out of the European working class movement that emerged in the final quarter of the 19th century and continued in that form until the middle years of the twentieth century. Its two institutional expressions were the 2nd and 3rd Internationals, which despite the great schism in 1919, were marked by a shared conception of capital and labour. Their fortunes therefore rose and fell together. Trotskyism and Left communism were equally orthodox in their thinking and approach, and therefore must be considered left-variants of this tradition.\n\nTwo variants of orthodox Marxism are impossibilism and anti-revisionism. Impossibilism is a form of orthodox Marxism that both rejects the reformism of revisionist Marxism and opposes the Leninist theories of imperialism, vanguardism and democratic centralism (which argue that socialism can be constructed in underdeveloped, quasi-feudal countries through revolutionary action as opposed to being an emergent result of advances in material development). An extreme form of this position is held by the Socialist Party of Great Britain. In contrast, the anti-revisionist tradition criticised official Communist parties from the opposite perspective as having abandoned the orthodox Marxism of the founding fathers.\n\nA number of theoretical perspectives and political movements emerged that were firmly rooted in orthodox Marxist analysis, as contrasted with later interpretations and alternative developments in Marxist theory and practice such as Marxism–Leninism, revisionism and reformism.\n\nImpossibilism stresses the limited value of economic, social, cultural and political reforms under capitalism and posits that socialists and Marxists should solely focus on efforts to propagate and establish socialism, disregarding any other cause that has no connection to the goal of the realization of socialism.\n\nImpossibilism posits that reforms to capitalism are counterproductive because they strengthen support for capitalism by the working class by making its conditions more tolerable while creating further contradictions of their own, while removing the socialist character of the parties championing and implementing said reforms. Because reforms cannot solve the systemic contradictions of capitalism, impossibilism opposes reformism, revisionism and ethical socialism.\n\nImpossibilism also opposes the idea of a vanguard-led revolution and the centralization of political power in any elite group of people as espoused by Leninism and Marxism–Leninism .\n\nThis perspective is maintained by the World Socialist Movement, De Leonism, and to some extent followers of Karl Kautsky and pre-reformist social democracy.\n\nLuxemburgism is an informal designation for a current of Marxist thought and practice that originates from the ideas and work of Rosa Luxemburg. In particular, it stresses the importance for spontaneous revolution which can only emerge in response to mounting contradictions between the productive forces and social relations of society and therefore rejects Leninism and Bolshevism for its insistence on a \"hands-on\" approach to revolution. Luxemburgism is also highly critical of the reformist Marxism that emerged from the work of Eduard Bernstein's faction of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. According to Rosa Luxemburg, under reformism \"[capitalism] is not overthrown, but is on the contrary strengthened by the development of social reforms\".\n\nMenshevism refers to the political positions taken by the Menshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party prior to the October Revolution of 1917. The Mensheviks believed that socialism could not be realized in Russia due to its backwards economic conditions and that Russia would first have to experience a bourgeois revolution and go through a capitalist stage of development before socialism became technically possible and before the working class could develop the class consciousness for a socialist revolution. The Mensheviks were thus opposed to the Bolshevik idea of a vanguard party and their pursuit of socialist revolution in semi-feudal Russia.\n\nKarl Kautsky is recognized as one of the most authoritative promulgators of orthodox Marxism following the death of Friedrich Engels in 1895. As an advisor to August Bebel, leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) until Bebel's death in 1913 and as editor of Die Neue Zeit from 1883 till 1917, he was known as the \"Pope of Marxism\". He was removed as editor by the leadership of the SPD when the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) split away from the SPD. Kautsky was an outspoken critic of Bolshevism and Leninism, seeing the Bolsheviks (or Communists as they had renamed themselves after 1917) as an organization that had gained power by a coup and initiated revolutionary changes for which there was no economic rationale in Russia. Kautsky was also opposed to Eduard Bernstein's reformist politics in the period 1896–1901.\n\nInstrumental Marxism is a theory derived from classical Marxism which reasons that policy makers in government and positions of power tend to \"share a common business or class background, and that their decisions will reflect their business or class interests\".\n\nThere have been a number of criticisms of orthodox Marxism from within the socialist movement. From the 1890s during the Second International, Eduard Bernstein and others developed a position known as revisionism, which sought to revise Marx's views based on the idea that the progressive development of capitalism and the extension of democracy meant that gradual, parliamentary reform could achieve socialism. This view was contested by orthodox Marxists such as Kautsky as well as by the young Georg Lukacs, who in 1919 clarified the definition of orthodox Marxism as thus: [O]rthodoxy refers exclusively to method. It is the scientific conviction that dialectical materialism is the road to truth and that its methods can be developed, expanded and deepened only along the lines laid down by its founders. It is the conviction, moreover, that all attempts to surpass or 'improve' it have led and must lead to over-simplification, triviality and eclecticism.\n\nWestern Marxism, the intellectual Marxism which developed in Western Europe from the 1920s onwards, sought to make Marxism more \"sophisticated\", open and flexible by examining issues like culture that were outside the field of orthodox Marxism. Western Marxists, such as Georg Lukács, Karl Korsch, Antonio Gramsci and the Frankfurt School, have tended to be open to influences orthodox Marxists consider bourgeois, such as psychoanalysis and the sociology of Max Weber. Marco Torres illustrates the shift away from orthodox Marxism in the Frankfurt School: In the early 1920s, the original members of the Frankfurt Institute—half forgotten names such as Carl Grünberg, Henryk Grossman and Karl August Wittfogel, were social scientists of an orthodox Marxist conviction. They understood their task as an advancement of the sciences that would prove useful in solving the problems of a Europe-wide transition into socialism, which they saw, if not as inevitable, at least as highly likely. But as fascism reared its head in Germany and throughout Europe, the younger members of the Institute saw the necessity for a different kind of Marxist Scholarship. Beyond accumulating knowledge relevant to an orthodox Marxist line, they felt the need to take the more critical and negative approach that is required for the maintenance of an integral and penetrating understanding of society during a moment of reaction. This could be described as the politically necessary transition from Marxist positive science to Critical Theory.\n\nIn parallel to this, Cedric Robinson has identified a Black Marxist tradition, including people like C.L.R. James and W. E. B. Du Bois, who have opened Marxism to the study of race.\n\nIn the postwar period, the New Left and new social movements gave rise to intellectual and political currents which again challenged orthodox Marxism. These include Italian autonomism, French Situationism, the Yugoslavian Praxis School, British cultural studies, Marxist feminism, Marxist humanism, analytical Marxism and critical realism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13452960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13452960", "title": "Partition of Belgium", "text": "Partition of Belgium\n\nThe partition of Belgium is a hypothetical situation which has been discussed by both Belgian and international media, especially in the context of events such as the 2007–11 Belgian political crisis. The status of Brussels in a partitioned Belgium is unclear and controversial.\n\nThe territories corresponding to the modern Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourgish states are collectively called the Low Countries. They emerged at the end of the Middle Ages as a set of more or less independent fiefdoms loosely linked to the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire. The southern part of this region—the Southern Netherlands, the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, the Imperial Abbey of Stavelot-Malmedy and the Duchy of Bouillon—was partitioned both politically (into many fiefdoms), and linguistically (into the Romanic and Germanic Sprachräume). The feudal borders did not match the linguistic borders, and some fiefdoms were divided into Francophone and Germanic regions. However, the ruling aristocracy, which usually spoke languages other than the population, did not much bother about these language-related disparities. After the 1581 secession of the Dutch Republic in the northern Low Countries, French progressively emerged in the Southern Netherlands under the influence of the Habsburg nobility and, later, of the French invasions, as the upper class language, not only at the court but also in the administration and in the political circles.\n\nAntagonism between speakers of French and Dutch increased after the independence of Belgium in 1830, when residents of the Southern Netherlands rebelled against the newfound hegemony of the northern provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Major European powers were divided in opinion over the fallout of the revolution. Ultimately, the state of Belgium, composed of provinces of both French-speaking and Dutch-speaking people, gained independence as a buffer state between France and the Netherlands. French became the sole official language. Dutch speakers demanded equal rights beginning in the late 19th century, but these were only introduced gradually throughout the 20th century. While postage stamps became bilingual in 1893, it was not until 1967 that an official Dutch version of the Constitution was accepted. Since independence, socio-economic imbalances have fueled resentment between the two communities.\n\nSince the 1960s, separate regions have been created based on the country's linguistic division. As a result, minorities in certain areas (in and around Brussels and along the language border) claim to be disenfranchised in local government and services. Along with the usual left–right political division, there is also a linguistic division, causing a double party system which complicates coalition creation on the national level. The recent crisis over the formation of a coalition government in the aftermath of the 2007 elections, coupled with the unsolved problem of the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde electoral district and the rise of extremist political parties, has given a fresh impetus to the issue, with recent opinion polls showing sizable support for a partition. However, support for a unified state remains among the majority of Belgium's people. Unitarists claim that the monarchy, strong national institutions, and the geopolitical importance of the linguistically and ethnically mixed Brussels serve as unifying elements, while separatists rather claim these factors (and the considerable state debt) serve merely as obstacles to an inevitable partition. Some political observers have suggested that a possible partition of Belgium may be a blow to the European Union model of diverse cultures working together.\n\nAs no census exists, there are no official statistics on Belgium's three official languages or their dialects. Various criteria, including the language(s) of parents, of education, or the second-language status of foreign born, may affect suggested figures. An estimated 59% of the Belgian population speaks Dutch (often colloquially referred to as \"Flemish\"), and French is spoken by 40%. Total Dutch speakers number 6.23 million, concentrated in the northern Flanders region, while French speakers comprise 3.32 million in Wallonia and an estimated 870,000 (85%) of the officially bilingual Brussels-Capital Region. The German-speaking Community is made up of 73,000 people in the east of Wallonia; around 10,000 German and 60,000 Belgian nationals are speakers of German. Roughly 23,000 more German speakers live in municipalities near the official Community.\nThe Capital Region having bilingual status obliges its authorities to attend to people and organisations in French or Dutch language as these prefer, and to show street names in both languages on the plates, but does not allow a bilingual school as education belongs to either the French Community or the Flemish one. Geographically, it is an enclave in the Flemish Region, though near Wallonia. Constitutionally, it is a politically distinct Region, while within its boundaries both the Flemish and French Communities exercise their authority. Historically, the local language of Brussels was Dutch, and Dutch remained the vernacular language of a majority of inhabitants until around 1950.\n\nDutch is mainly spoken by approximately 150,000 residents, or a 15% minority, at most. The city has strong economic ties with surrounding Flanders, and many Dutch-speakers commute to Brussels for work; but, at the same time, the expanding suburbs of Brussels led to a majority of French-speakers in six Flemish villages.\n\nThe territory of Belgium is the southern part of the historical region called Low Countries. The Low Countries emerged at the end of the Middle Ages as a very loose political confederation of fiefdoms ruled in personal union by the House of Habsburg: the Seventeen Provinces. The largest components of this union were the Duchy of Brabant, the County of Flanders, the County of Hainaut and the Duchy of Luxembourg. The Prince-Bishopric of Liège was almost an enclave within the Seventeen Provinces. The prince-bishopric was not formally included in the Habsburgs' dominion but was, since the time of Emperor Charles V, strongly influenced by its Habsburg neighbors. The border which emerged after the Dutch Revolt and the Eighty Years' War split the Seventeen Provinces into the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands. In particular Brabant and Flanders were divided into northern and southern components. Though the fiefdoms constituting the Southern Netherlands were more or less ruled by a single reigning House, they were all quite distinct. Different traditions and dialects of Dutch and Walloon appeared. Within the largest fiefdoms like Liège, Flanders and Luxembourg, several distinct languages and dialects were in use.\nThe feudal borders partitioning Belgium during the Ancien Régime have nothing in common with the partitioning lines which currently separate the Belgian federal entities. The French disbanded these feudal entities and replaced them with departments during the French occupation from 1794 to 1815. The new entities or departments mirrored, approximately, the language border. For instance the new division separated the bilingual kernel of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège into two more or less monolingual regions. The only major exceptions were the bilingual Dyle and Forêts departments. The departments would eventually become the provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and later on of Belgium. The name of the provinces were inspired by the roughly corresponding medieval fiefdoms. In particular, the Dyle department became the province of Brabant, that is the most southern part of the older duchy of Brabant.\n\nIn 1815, the territory now constituting Belgium was incorporated into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, which had been created to rehabilitate and consolidate the former Seventeen Provinces and serve as a buffer against any expansionist ambitions of France. However, this placed the Catholic Belgian provinces, including French-speaking Wallonia, under Dutch-majority rule and a Calvinist Dutch king. The Belgians had little influence over their lives and resented Dutch control and domination over economic, political and social institutions, sentiment that culminated in revolution in 1830.\n\nMajor European powers (which included France, Prussia and the United Kingdom) were divided over their response to the revolution of the Belgian people against the Dutch royal authorities. France favored the secession of Belgium from the Netherlands, hoping to annex all or at least part of the area, which was also the aim of most of the Belgian insurgents. After this proposal had been rejected by the other European powers, which supported the continued union of the Netherlands, Talleyrand, the French ambassador to the United Kingdom, proposed a partition of the Southern Netherlands (most areas of modern Belgium). To this end, the parts of the provinces of Liège, of Limburg and of Namur east of the Meuse river as well as the cities of Maastricht and Liège and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg would go to Prussia. Part of the province of East Flanders, nearly all of the province of Brabant, the province of Hainaut and the province of Namur west of the Meuse would be assigned to France. The province of Antwerp—except the city of Antwerp itself—and the province of Limburg, west of the Meuse river—except Maastricht—would remain with the Netherlands, as would a small part of the province of Brabant, the former Oranje Lordship of Diest. West Flanders, most of East Flanders, including Zeelandic Flanders, and the city of Antwerp were to form the Free State of Antwerp, under British protection.\n\nHowever, this plan was rejected and Belgium was established as an essential buffer state to check the ambitions of France. Wallonia and Flanders were unified as one state under a German prince, Leopold I of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. A historian of the Belgian revolution said that \"in Belgium, there are parties and provinces, but no nation. Like a tent erected for one night, the new monarchy, after sheltering us from the tempest, will disappear without a trace.\"\n\nThe language border separating the Germanic and Romance \"Sprachräume\" moved over the centuries which preceded the establishment of the Belgian state over an area between the Ardennes and the more or less straight line going from Aachen to Calais on the one hand and the much less populated frontier from Aachen to Arlon via Malmedy. However, this frontier has not much changed since the 18th century. For example, in the communes of Mouscron-Comines-Warneton, French seems to be dominant at least since 1761. The frontier splitting the older province of Brabant and the Hesbaye moved regularly during the 17th and 18th centuries. Some communes, such as Hélécine, switched from Dutch to French and others, such as Herstappe, switched from French to Dutch. The Voeren have a long Flemish tradition and, in the Land of Herve, several communes which used to use Germanic dialects switched to French during the 18th century, as for example, Berneau and Warsage, both now part of Dalhem and Saint-Jean-Sart, a hamlet of Aubel.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, this language border did not merely distinguish speakers of Belgian French, standard Dutch and standard German, as today, but between Romance and Germanic dialect continua. The Germanic \"Sprachraum\" was made of different components such as West Flemish, East Flemish, Brabantic, Limburgish, Ripuarian (transitional dialects between Limbourgish and Ripuarian are called Low Dietsch), Moselle Franconian dialect of Trier and Luxembourgish. The Romance sprachraum was made of Picard, Walloon (with four distinct dialects around the cities of Charleroi, Namur, Liège and Bastogne), Lorrain and Champenois. Due to mass education and the expansion of modern media such as television, the mid-20th century saw a uniformization of the different language regions, leading to the domination of the standard languages in their respective domains. In Wallonia, French became the dominant, priority language (local dialects being seldom used). Elsewhere in the Low Countries, the local dialects survived better, at least in private use.\n\nThe historical language border in the Low Countries corresponds to the frontier between populations whose majorities spoke distinct languages. However, the ruling upper classes most often spoke French. As was the case in many European noble courts, French was historically the nobility's language. This was also the case most of the rest of the Low Countries. Several sovereigns of the region, notably including Maria Theresa of Austria, succeeded in making French not only the language of the court but also of their administrations. For instance, while the major part of the population of Luxembourg speaks Luxembourgish in a private context, the administrative language of Luxembourg is French. As another example, the motto of the Kingdom of the Netherlands is the French phrase: \"Je maintiendrai\", because the language of the Orange-Nassau reigning family was French until 1890. In Flanders, until the beginning of the 20th century, many upper class Flemish burghers, such as Maurice Maeterlinck or Suzanne Lilar, used French as their first language. Another example is the University of Ghent which was a French-speaking institution until 1930.\nThe language areas were established in 1963. The division into language areas was included into the Belgian Constitution in 1970. The border between the language areas is the so-called Belgian language or linguistic border. It is based on the actual language border between the sprachraums but is not utterly identical. Through constitutional reforms in the 1970s and 1980s, regionalisation of the unitary state led to a three-tiered federation: federal, regional, and community governments were created, a compromise designed to minimize linguistic, cultural, social and economic tensions. The authority of the Regions and Communities is limited to some language areas:\nThis territorial issue, in particular around Brussels, is a source of tension between the Belgian communities.\n\nCurrents of Belgian nationalism began to emerge in the late 19th century, seeking to overcome the ethnic and linguistic divide and create a national culture. Historian Henri Pirenne asserted that Belgian identity was not defined on racial, ethnic or linguistic lines, but in the civilizational community of the Belgian people. Supporters of a partition of Belgium argue that the synchronized attempts to forge a national identity and culture have been unable to forestall ethno-linguistic rivalries.\n\nFrench was the only official language of Belgium until 1898, even though Flanders was and still is predominantly Dutch-speaking. The government's long refusal to acknowledge Dutch as an official language led to hostilities between Flanders and the French-speaking bourgeoisie who held both political and economic power. These hostilities gave rise to the Flemish movement, which began as a literary and cultural organization, but later became a political movement that called for legal recognition of Dutch and for social emancipation of the Flemish people. The 1898 Equality Law made Dutch an official language of Belgium, but it did not become the sole official language of Flanders until 1921. The Frenchification of Brussels was at that time in full expansion. To this day, French remains the language of the aristocracy.\n\nWhile a Walloon industrial and mining base developed during the 19th century, the largely agrarian Flanders area trailed in socio-economic development, leading to widespread demands for regional autonomy and the correction of imbalances in taxation, social services, and representation. The deterioration of the Walloon industrial base in the late 20th century occurred parallel to the growth of service and technological industries in Flanders, aggravating socio-economic tensions. Modern Fleming demands center over the alleged over-taxation of Flanders and insufficient autonomy and complaints over the concentration of social services in Wallonia, causing a so-called \"stream of money\" from Flanders to Wallonia. The Flemish movement has inspired the growth of Flemish nationalist political parties such as the Volksunie (People's Union) which split into different parties including the Vlaams Blok (succeeded by the Vlaams Belang), the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and FlemishProgressives. While the N-VA seeks greater autonomy and favours the independence of Flanders, possibly in a confederate state, the Vlaams Belang is more clearly separatist.\n\nThe Walloon movement arose in the 19th century along with the language disputes; French-speakers sought the preservation of the French language and culture as the defining creed of the country. French-speaking politicians (who were sometimes elected in Flanders) and other influential citizens opposed the Flemish demands for the recognition of Dutch and wished to maintain a centralized government to prevent regionalization. On the other hand, the Walloon politician Jules Destrée reacted in 1912 to the process of minorisation of Wallonia and asked explicitly for a splitting of Belgium along linguistic lines. However, Destrée was using the word \"separation\" in French in the sense of federalization (), and not in the sense of complete partition. \"The New York Times\" explained that Destrée was afraid of the domination of the Flemings within Belgian institutions.\n\nThe Flemish historian Maarten van Ginderachter wrote that the Walloons were \"excluded from the national power, between 1884 and 1902 there was only one Walloon in the Belgian government\"\n\nAfter the division of Belgium into two clearly separate linguistic areas, and after the economic decline of Wallonia, two more or less separate currents have formed. One is a more regional Walloon movement, demanding to maintain the solidarity between the richer north and the poorer south, but also increasingly stressing the separate cultural identity of Wallonia. Another current is merely Francophone and pro-Belgian, but not regional as such, mainly based on the French-speakers of Brussels and especially of the surrounding rim municipalities which are effectively suburbs of Brussels but situated in Flanders. The two movements have in common the support of the French language, support of the Belgian state and opposition to further federal devolution. A minority of Walloons, however, support increased independence. Flemish nationalists have claimed that the French-speaking \"Belgicists\" of Brussels and its suburbs do not have common interests with the Walloons, but that these two parties have formed a quid-pro-quo alliance to oppose the Dutch-speaking majority. According to this analysis, Walloon politicians would allegedly give political support to the French-speaking politicians of Brussels (and its surroundings) in return for receiving economic support to Wallonia.\n\nSince the 1960s, Belgian political parties and civic organizations have witnessed bifurcation of membership and organizations between Walloon and Flanders. Ethnic tensions affect the working of local governments, which often pass laws prohibiting the use of the language of the respective minority populations in official functions. For example, municipal council meetings in Flanders must take place in Dutch, even if a majority of the council is French-speaking. On the other hand, Dutch-speaking citizens of the Flemish municipalities close to Brussels claim their position is being undermined by the minority rights of French-speaking settlers. Significant pressures in living conditions have kept the two main communities separate and confined to their majority regions; stark ethnic and linguistic segregation has emerged in Brussels, the capital and largest city of the country. Ethnic tensions have affected some of the city's surrounding municipalities, which are situated in Flanders, but have had a great influx of monolingual French-speakers as a result of suburbanisation. These Dutch-speaking \"facility municipalities\" are obliged to offer local government services in French, meaning health-care and public amenities are divided on linguistic lines, and in some municipalities the original French-speaking minority is believed to have become a majority.\n\nThe main reason for Brussels being mainly French-speaking was the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium during the 19th century and the severe discrimination of both Dutch as a language and of the Flemings. French was, at that time, the language of the administration, government, culture, law and education. From 1880 onwards, more and more Dutch-speaking people became bilingual and passed only French on to their children, resulting in a rise of monolingual French-speakers after 1910. Halfway through the 20th century, the number of monolingual French-speakers carried the day over the (mostly) bilingual Flemish inhabitants. Only since the 1960s, after the fixation of the Belgian language border and the socio-economic development of Flanders was in full effect, could Dutch stem the tide of increasing French use.\n\nThe status of Brussels in a partitioned Belgium is uncertain and a source of considerable debate.\n\n\nOne idea is that the city rejoins Flanders in which Brussels is geographically and economically embedded. Proposals include a guarantee that the linguistic rights of the French-speaking population in Brussels are safeguarded.\n\nAnother idea is that Brussels would form a union with Wallonia, often referred to as Wallobrux. One problem is that the regions do not border each other, as Brussels is an enclave in Flanders. Some French-speaking politicians therefore demand that a corridor be made between the two territories (see the topic of the extension of Brussels below).\n\n\nAnother idea is that Brussels would become a \"European [capital] district\", similar to Washington D.C. or the Australian Capital Territory, run by the EU rather than Flanders or Wallonia. The Union's structure, however, has no experience at governing at this level at present. To fulfill this solution in practice, Brussels would probably need to be an independent city-state which could join the EU on equal footing with other EU member states. The possible status of Brussels as a \"city-state\" has been suggested by Charles Picqué, Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region, who sees a tax on the EU institutions as a way of enriching the city. However, the Belgian issue has generated very little discussion within the EU bodies.\n\nA controversial issue, complicating the \"city-state\" scenario, is the possible extension of the Brussels capital region into the surrounding municipalities within Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant. This proposal is not necessarily linked to a split-up of Belgium.\n\nSome have, however, suggested that these wealthy areas would make the city financially viable as an independent state, potentially give it around 1.5 million inhabitants, an airport and forest within its boundaries, and make it three or four times larger than the current capital region. Currently, Brussels is the most important seat of EU institutions, but the EU has no formal capital. It has been claimed that a large and independent status may help Brussels advance its claim as the capital of the EU.\n\nThe enlargement of the Brussels capital region is supported by many French-speakers in the Flemish municipalities with facilities for French-speakers surrounding Brussels. As a result of suburbanisation and an influx of French-speakers and EU officials from Brussels, these municipalities have in recent decades become increasingly French-speaking to an extent that French-speakers now form a majority in some municipalities. In contrast, an extension of the bilingual region is out of the question for the Dutch-speaking inhabitants of these communities and for virtually all Flemish political parties, who say that these newer inhabitants should respect and adjust to the language of the region they are moving into. In fact the facilities now in place were initially established in order to ease the adaptation of the French-speaking to living in a Flemish area.\n\nSimilar to a \"Greater Brussels\" region, the electoral district of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde consisted of Brussels and 35 surrounding municipalities in Flanders. Prior to its dissolution, this district was the last remaining entity in Belgium that did not coincide with provincial borders, and as such had been deemed unconstitutional by the Belgian Constitutional Court. The district was a conflict issue for several years, and a major political problem in the cabinet formation crisis of 2007–2008. In July 2012, following the 2010–2011 Belgian government formation, Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde was split into two parts as part of the sixth Belgian state reform.\n\n\nAnother proposition is the establishment of a condominium of the Flemish and the French-speaking Communities of Brussels, where both sides would govern Brussels together for national and international issues. For all local territorial policies, Brussels would be fully autonomous. For all 'non-territorial' public services (as culture, welfare and education), each community would enjoy autonomy. This idea is in general popular among Flemish politicians, such as socialist politician Louis Tobback and nationalist Bart De Wever.\n\nSuch an arrangement has existed for several centuries in Maastricht. Shortly after 1200 this city received dual authority, with the prince-bishops of Liège and the dukes of Brabant holding joint sovereignty over the city. In 1284, this dual authority was formally endorsed in a constitutional agreement, the 'Alde Caerte' ('Old Charter'). After some disputes in the interpretation, this was elaborated further in 1356 with the Doghter Caerte ('Daughter Charter'). These institutional arrangements then survived until the French Revolution.\n\nThis dual authority ensured a relatively stable and prosperous institutional environment for nearly six centuries (from 1204 till 1794). The citizens from Maastricht had to choose between the Brabant nationality (and jurisprudence) and the Liège nationality. Each had its own judges and public services. Something similar would be the case if Brussels would become a condominium governed by the two major communities, the French-speakers and the Flemings.\n\nThe small German-speaking Community of Belgium in the east is in fact more an observer than a player in the difficult negotiations between Flanders and Wallonia. The region of Eupen-Malmedy was given to Belgium in the aftermath of the First World War. (The former German city of Malmedy and the surrounding villages are Walloon and therefore are not part of the German-speaking Community.) The territory consists of two detached parts with a total area of about . Approximately 75,000 people live there. The conflict between Walloons and Flemings provided the German-speaking Community with considerable autonomy. Although the region is too small to play a role in the negotiations, it obtained an autonomy similar to that of its larger neighbors. The German-speaking Belgians now have a parliament and a government with four ministers and a minister-president.\n\nFour theoretical scenarios are usually considered in the event that a partition of Belgium would occur: remaining with Wallonia, sovereign statehood, reattachment to Germany, or attachment to Luxembourg. The community is part of the Walloon province of Liège and, per se, would stay so in case of partition. This status quo solution is the most probable, although it is uncertain whether or not the German-speakers could maintain their cultural and political rights in the long term in an otherwise monolingual francophone country. The other three possibilities would become realistic only if Wallonia were to seek unification with France. Since the community used to be part of Germany, \"reunification\" seems to be the logical step to take (the region borders the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate). However, opponents to this idea argue that the autonomy of the region would be lost in Germany as much as it would in France. Therefore, and because of the strong cohesion of the regional population, some would prefer the creation of an independent state. They argue that the new country would, for example, be five times as large and more than twice as populous as Liechtenstein. Opponents say this would lead to the creation of a new undesired tax haven. The last option would be to merge with Luxembourg. Supporters of this scenario underline that many from St. Vith currently commute to Luxembourg and that a union with the rich Grand Duchy would be economically profitable. However this would leave the northern part of the community around Eupen as an exclave of Luxembourg. Minister-president Karl-Heinz Lambertz has been said to have supported such a project. He, however, has refuted this and has committed himself to the continued union with Belgium. In an interview with the German TV-channel ZDF in February 2011, he listed the four aforementioned options concerning the future of the German-speaking Community.\n\nThe parties with long lasting participation in the Belgian governments, that is the Christian Democrats, the Liberals and the Socialists, as well as the Green parties, usually refuse to speak openly about a possible partitioning of Belgium. This question seems to be taboo on the Belgian political scene and is only discussed from time to time by mainstream politicians in order to menace the other community, not unlike the atomic bomb threat during the Cold War context. In particular, on September 6, 2010, after long lasting negotiation for the formation of the federal government, most leaders of the French-speaking Socialist Party simultaneously declared that they now consider the partition of Belgium as a realistic alternative solution to the Belgian problems. This openly separatist point of view expressed by the French-speaking Socialists is analysed by some, including French-speaking liberals and most Flemish politicians, as an idle threat which aims at forcing progress in communitarian negotiations. The heart of the problem is not the partition of Belgium but its federalization also called regionalization or communitarization. This process of devolution, which began in the 1960s due to the pressure of the Flemish movement and, to a lesser extent, of the Walloon movement, is called in the Belgian context the \"state reform\". While most Francophones argue that the state reform is unnecessary, virtually all Flemish political parties demand a severe reform of the Belgian state. In particular the N-VA and a part of the Flemish movement want to apply the so-called Maddens Doctrine in order to enforce the Francophones to require such a state reform.\nSocialist Party Different (sp.a), the Flemish socialist party, states on its website that it believes an independent Flanders is not necessary. It does support the devolution of a number of additional responsibilities, such as the railways or the policy of employment. Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open VLD) want more socio-economic and financial autonomy for Flanders, a homogenous division of responsibilities, more cooperation between the communities and regions and a strong federal state. Green, the Flemish green party, wants another round in the state reform, but only if it leads to more solidarity, a better functioning of the institutions and more democracy. It states on its website that it doesn’t want to reform for the purpose of reforming. Green wants Belgium to remain a federal state and considers the cooperation between different communities within one state to be a challenge rather than a problem. It also pleads for federal loyalty and respect for the rulings of the Constitutional Court and wants to see a more homogenous division of responsibilities.\n\nThe Francophone Socialist Party (PS) and Christian democrats (cdH) promote the conservation of the current Belgian welfare state, and therefore oppose any further regionalisation of the federal social policies. The Reformist Movement, the Francophone liberal party, stresses in its manifesto that the Flemings are intending to split most of the solidarity mechanisms that exist between the Belgians. They also state that they minimize the importance of the Brussels-Capital Region as a constitutional component of the federal state. Their approach is to build strong links between the different components of the French-speaking part of Belgium, including Brussels and Wallonnia as well as the municipalities with a French-speaking presence around Brussels and in Voeren. The aim of this approach is to create a strong autonomous Francophone component within the federal state. Écolo, the Francophone Green party, supports an improvement of the political links between the communities. They suggest, among other things, the creation of a national electoral arrondissement for the election of part of the federal parliament.\n\nIn Flanders, several large parties openly call for a partition of the country. Until the 2010 federal elections, the largest was the far-right party Flemish Interest. Since 2010, the largest Flemish nationalist party in Belgium is the more moderate New Flemish Alliance (N-VA). N-VA does not openly advocate the partition of Belgium, instead proposing a confederalist solution, where the center of power would shift to the regional governments, while certain tasks such as e.g. the army, diplomacy or the national football competition would remain on the Belgian level. Another openly separatist moderate party that emerged in 2007 is List Dedecker, which was relatively successful in the 2007 federal and 2009 regional elections, winning several seats, but subsequently lost all of them again in the 2014 federal and regional elections, due to the large success of the N-VA . In Wallonia and Brussels, only the Wallonia-France Rally party is openly separatist. This party, which has no elected representative at either the national or regional level, promotes the partition of Belgium and a union of Wallonia and Brussels with France.\n\nSeveral small parties with no or very few seats at the parliament campaign explicitly for the unity of the Belgian state. The conservative Belgian Union promotes a stronger federal government and a return to the Belgian unitary state which existed in the 1960s. The far-left Workers' Party of Belgium also supports the unity of Belgium since it considers the federalisation of the country as an employers' attack at the welfare state and the unity of the trade unions. The Francophone far-right Front National is also explicitly opposed to the partition of Belgium.\n\nThere are several Walloon representatives of the Socialist Party in the Walloon Parliament who are in favour of the Walloon Regionalism, also in the Walloon Government such as Eliane Tillieux and Jean-Claude Marcourt for instance, i.e. two socialist ministers on the four of the Walloon Government. The Walloon wing of the General Federation of Belgian Labour are in favour of more powers for the Regions.\n\nThe Belgian general election, 2007, resulted in no political party or coalition gaining enough seats to form a working majority. The crisis continued for 196 days, leaving Belgium without a government with a popular mandate. While prime minister Guy Verhofstadt's lame duck ministry remained in power as caretaker, several leading politicians were nominated without success by the King to build a stable governmental coalition. Flemish politician Yves Leterme had been the prime candidate to lead the national government, but a political gaffe would prove to be his undoing. Asked to sing the Belgian national anthem in French at National Day celebrations, instead of the Brabançonne Leterme started to sing the \"Marseillaise\", France's anthem. Leterme's error drew condemnation from the different communities, aggravating distrust and separatist sentiments.\n\nEventually, after 196 days, the parties finally succeeded in forming a new government. In December 2008, another crisis related to the Fortis case, erupted, again destabilising the country and resulting in the resignation of Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme. The new Herman Van Rompuy-led government brought a brief period of fragile stability, but ended when Van Rompuy left his office to become the first full-term President of the European Council. The succeeding Leterme II government fell in April 2010 over the lack of progress on resolving the BHV issue.\n\nAlthough most Flemish political parties describe their demands as limited to seeking greater regional autonomy and decentralization of government (save for members of the Vlaams Belang party, who called for a splitting of the country and claim of a national identity, culture and institutions, and claim Belgium is an \"unnatural\" and \"artificial\" state, formed simply as a buffer between France and other European powers during 19th century conflicts), some public opinion polls performed during the communautary crisis showed that approximately 46% of Flemish people support secession from Belgium. Other surveys indicated only 12% of the Flemings want the end of Belgium, whereas 37% want more responsibilities to be devolved to communities and the regions. Many French-speakers maintain that there is sufficient regional autonomy and that Flemish demands are exaggerated and separatist in nature. However, the diversity of Brussels and its significant economic and geopolitical importance in the Western hemisphere as the headquarters of the European Union and NATO, make it a unifying force, making partition unlikely at least for the near future. In response to heightening domestic and international speculation regarding the country's future, the Belgian government launched a public relations campaign through its embassies worldwide to assuage concerns and fight speculation that Belgium's division is impending, as indicated by numerous recent public opinion polls. The King of the Belgians rejected notions and speculation over a change in the nature of the Belgian state as part of proposals for the formation of a working government.\n\nOn November 18, 2007, an estimated 25,000 people marched in Brussels to support the unity of Belgium. The march was organized by Marie-Claire Houart whose petition calling for unity was signed by 140,000 Belgians.\n\nThe Belgian Chamber of Representatives on November 22, 2007, rejected the consideration of a proposed resolution to dissolve Belgium. The resolution had been introduced on October 29 by Bart Laeremans, Gerolf Annemans, Filip De Man and Linda Vissers (Vlaams Belang) and called upon the federal government to \"take without delay the measures necessary for the purpose of preparing the break-up of the Belgian State, so the three communities—Flemings, Walloons and Germans—can go their own separate ways.\" Most Flemish parties voted against the consideration of the proposal. The three members of the New Flemish Alliance abstained, together with three members of CD&V.\n\nIn 2007, Polls in \"Editie NL\", a Dutch news program on the commercial station RTL 4 and newspaper \"De Dag\" (\"The Day\") in the Netherlands showed that between 45% and 77% of Dutch nationals (the results of the two different polls) would support a merger of their country with Flanders. However a similar poll performed by Synovate Nederland in 2010, showed that only 20% of the Dutch support a union between the Netherlands and Flanders. A comparable poll held in 2007 in France showed that a majority of French citizens would support a merger of Wallonia with France, if Belgium ceased to exist. However, French politicians have ruled out any interference into the inner Belgian debate.\n\nAfter the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open VLD) left the government on April 22, 2010, Prime Minister Yves Leterme offered his resignation to King Albert II. An election were then called for June 13, amid fears that coalition-building would once again be protracted. In Flanders, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) party won a plurality with 27.8% of votes, while the winning party in Wallonia was the Socialist Party. Both parties, along with other parties, negotiated a state reform during the 2010 Belgian government formation.\n\nAlthough seven parties (N-VA, CD&V, sp.a, Groen!, PS, cdH, and Ecolo) were participating, the negotiations were led by the main winners, Bart De Wever (N-VA) and Elio Di Rupo (PS). The large number of implied parties was due not only to the multipolar Belgian political landscape but also to the will of the Flemish parties to reform the state and, hence, to change the constitution, which can be modified according only to very restrictive rules including a two-third majority vote in the Lower House.\n\nSome in the international media saw this election as evidence that Belgium would be partitioned. On September 9, 2010, a poll taken by RTL showed that a third of the French-speaking population supported the beginning of preparations for the country's partition. On September 13, Het Laatste Nieuws published the result of a poll within the Flemish population. According to these results 60% of the Flemish did not desire an independent Flemish state and 26% were willing to support a partition. A similar poll taken on September 25, 2010, by La Libre Belgique showed that 40% of the Belgians were willing to return to a unitary Belgium (as the country was before the state reform of the 1970s). This percentage is to be compared with the 12% of the Belgians wanting a partition of the country and the 32% who desired a further federalization. The poll also showed that a unitary Belgian state was supported by 22% of the Flemish, 50% of the Brusselers and 51% of the Walloons, and that 16% of the Flemish wished a split of Belgium. It is interesting to compare this with the 40.8% of Flemings who voted for a party advocating Flemish independence during the 2010 election. In any case, the vast majority of the Belgians want a change: only 8% agree with the current Belgian federal system. The Belgians who participated in this poll were also asked which scenario they would prefer in case a partition of Belgium did occur. An independent Flanders together with a union of Brussels and Wallonia was supported by 35% of the Belgians. The creation of three small states (Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia) was preferred by 23%, a union between France and Wallonia was supported by 14%, and a union between Flanders and Brussels together with an independent Wallonia by 12%. In Flanders, 27% supported a three-state scenario and 26% supported a union between Flanders and Brussels. Those who had no preferred scenario numbered 25%. The majority of the Walloons (53%) agreed with a union between Brussels and Wallonia while a minority (21%) supported a merge with France. Only 10% of the Walloons prefer an independent Walloon state. In contrast, the Brusselers were divided between a union with Wallonia (39%) and a city-state scenario (34%).\n\nOn October 4, 2010, Bart De Wever (N-VA) departed from the negotiations. His exit put Elio Di Rupo's Plan B for Belgium, i.e. a partition of Belgium along the borderline of the French Community, under a new light and many, particularly in the French-speaking part of the country, started to speak openly about its concrete realization. Plan B is the continuation of Belgium with Brussels and Wallonia only and the departure of Flanders from the Belgian federation. On October 10, Elio Di Rupo stated on television what his plan was: first, asking the Flemish population whether it was willing to secede; second, asking the population in Brussels and Wallonia whether they intended to remain united within Belgium. He also stressed that in either case citizens living in municipalities with linguistic facilities should also be asked. He however underlined that he did not desire such an extreme response but that this scenario should not be ignored. Di Rupo's declarations on television have been broadly discussed in the French-written press: according to Le Soir, the country had never been so close to a split than this day; less alarmist La Libre Belgique observed that the negotiations are deadlocked and considered Di Rupo's move a good way to define the point that the Francophones are not ready to negotiate further. However La Dernière Heure, L'Avenir and Flemish columnists in De Morgen, Het Laatste Nieuws and De Standaard condensed Di Rupo's Plan B down to a tactical move in order to put the pressure on the negotiations and redefine the relations between PS and MR. The Plan B proposed by Di Rupo was developed by Christian Berhendt, a specialist of constitutional law at the University of Liège. According to Berhendt, a hypothetical partition of Belgium is constrained by the fact that no political party is ready to split Belgium at the cost of separating from the numerous international organizations to which Belgium is affiliated. These constraints are such that a splitting of the country would require the modification and ratification of a huge number of treaties. The interpenetration of the Belgian entities is so complicated that, in comparison, the peaceful splitting of Czechoslovakia appears quite simple. According to Berhendt several scenarios are therefore impossible: a unilateral secession of Flanders would be rejected by countries fearing secession of their own minorities, such as China, Russia or Spain, because this would create a precedent they cannot allow; the creation of an autonomous European district in Brussels is not a realistic perspective because the European Union, as it is now, is not able to administrate such a large city; a scenario where Flanders and Brussels would form a union is unlikely either because, according to Berhendt, the French-speakers will never agree on such a treaty. For Marc Verdussen (Université Catholique de Louvain), two doorways are open: Plan B1, Belgium dissolves into two entities Flanders on the one hand and a new Wallonia-Brussels state on the other; and Plan B2, Flanders secedes and a residual Belgian state continues with Brussels and Wallonia. Though it is clear that Plan B2 is favorable to the Francophones, it is not evident that it would be accepted by the Flemings and by a hypothetical international tribunal. According to the Gewif (\"Groupe d'études pour la Wallonie intégrée à la France\"), Di Rupo's Plan B is not realisable because the new Brussels-Wallonia would inherit an unbearable debt. The Gewif therefore argued that only a union with France would be possible. On September 13 Le Soir published a five-pages article on the possible consequences. According to this analysis, the largest burden on the shoulders of the new Brussels-Wallonian state would be unemployment (17% of the workers; to be compared to 8% in Flanders) and state debt (150 Billions Euros, i.e. 106% of GDP). However Le Soir's columnists observed that the new state would have a huge GDP per capita (31,000 €) and would rank 7th among the 27 EU states. Nevertheless, this would be only due to the inclusion of Brussels where the GDP per capita numbers more than 60,000 €.\n\n"}

Many reflective writers keep in mind questions, such as \"What did I notice?\", \"How has this changed me?\" or \"What might I have done differently?\".\n\nThus, the focus is on writing that is not merely descriptive. The writer revisits the scene to note details and emotions, reflect on meaning, examine what went well or revealed a need for additional learning, and relate what transpired to the rest of life.\n\nReflective writing is also analyzing the event or idea (thinking in depth and from different perspectives, and trying to explain, often with reference to a model or theory from the subject.)\n"}
{"id": "2800790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2800790", "title": "Shabda", "text": "Shabda\n\nShabda, or , is the Sanskrit word for \"speech sound\". In Sanskrit grammar, the term refers to an utterance in the sense of linguistic performance.\n\nIn classical Indian philosophy of language, the grammarian Katyayana stated that \"shabda\" (\"speech\") is eternal (\"nitya\"), as is \"artha\" \"meaning\", and that they share a mutual co-relation. According to Patanjali, the permanent aspect of \"shabda\" is (\"meaning\"), while \"dhvani\" (\"sound, acoustics\") is ephemeral to \"shabda\".\n\nOm, or Aum, a sacred syllable of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, is considered to be the first resonating vibrational sound within an individual being. It also denotes the non-dualistic universe as a whole. In Buddhism, Om corresponds to the crown chakra and white light.\n\nBhartrihari, on the other hand, held a \"shabda-advaita\" position, identifying \"shabda\" as indivisible, and unifying the notions of cognition and linguistic performance, which is ultimately identical to Brahman. Bhartrhari recognised two entities, both of which may be referred to as \"shabda\". One entity is the underlying cause of the articulated sounds, while the other entity is the functionality that is used to express meaning. Bhartrhari thus rejected the difference posited between the ontological and the linguistic by logicians. His concept of \"shabda-brahman\" which identified linguistic performance and creation itself ran parallel to the Greek concept of \"logos\".\n\nLanguage philosophy in Medieval India was dominated by the dispute of the \"naturalists\" to the Mimamsa school, notably defended by Kumarila, who held that \"shabda\" designates the actual phonetic utterance, and the Sphota school, defended by Mandana Mishra, which identifies \"sphota\" and \"shabda\" as a mystical \"indivisible word-whole\".\n\n\"Shabda\" is a Sanskrit word that was first used as a religio-philosophic term in the context of Hindu religion. It refers to the verbal testimony (of revealed scriptures: \"shruti\" that is indispensable to gaining knowledge of the ultimate reality, Brahman.\n\nIn Sikhism the term \"Shabad\" has two primary meanings. The first context of the term is to refer to a hymn or paragraph or sections of the Holy Text that appears in Guru Granth Sahib, the main holy scripture of the Sikhs. The Guru Granth Sahib is organised by chapters of \"ragas\", with each chapter containing many \"shabads\" of that \"raga\". The first \"Shabad\" in Guru Granth Sahib is the Mool Mantar. The script used for the \"Shabad\" is Gurmukhi. \"Shabad\" is the term also used to refer to hymns within other Sikh scriptures, like Deh Siva Var Mohe. The second use of the term \"Shabad\" in Sikhism is for the holy name of God, Waheguru.\n\nEsoterically, \"Shabd\" is the “Sound Current vibrating in all creation. It can be heard by the inner ears.” Variously referred to as the \"Audible Life Stream\", \"Inner Sound\", \"Sound Current\" or \"Word\" in English, the \"Shabd\" is the esoteric essence of God which is available to all human beings, according to the Shabd path teachings of Sant Mat, Surat Shabd Yoga, Eckankar, Vardankar (a split-off from Eckankar), and Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness.\n\nAdherents believe that a \"satguru\", Eck Master, or VARDAN Master, who is a human being, has merged with the \"Shabd\" in such a manner that he or she is a living manifestation of it at its highest level (the “Word made flesh”). However, not only can the \"Satguru\" attain this, but all human beings are inherently privileged in this way. Indeed, in Sant Mat the \"raison d’être\" for the human form is to meditate on the Sound Current, and in so doing merge with it until one’s own divinity is ultimately realized.\n\n\"Naam\" (\"Word\") has been described through the use of several different terms. Sant Baljit Singh, a contemporary Sant Mat Master, uses the term \"Light and Sound Current\". He describes it as the connecting link between human beings and God.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24085977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24085977", "title": "Sir Galahad (poem)", "text": "Sir Galahad (poem)\n\n\"Sir Galahad\" is a poem written by Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, and published in his 1842 collection of poetry. It is one of his many poems that deal with the legend of King Arthur, and describes Galahad experiencing a vision of the Holy Grail. The subject of the poem was later included in \"The Holy Grail\" section of Tennyson's \"Idylls of the King\", but the latter version depicts Galahad as a pious individual who is grimly determined to fulfill his destiny. \"Sir Galahad\", in contrast, depicts Galahad as prideful, and has almost cheerful undertones.\n\nIn 1833, Tennyson's close friend Arthur Hallam died. The death greatly affected both Tennyson and his sister Emily, and he withdrew from society as he slowly dealt with the pain. By mid-summer 1834, they slowly began to participate together in social events once again. On one occasion, Tennyson, Emily, and his other sister Mary were invited to visit friends in Dorking, and then travel onwards to see the Hallam family. Tennyson, however, set out on his own, and spent time alone at Leith Hill, Dorking. It was during this time that he began working on a version of \"Sir Galahad\", along with an early version of \"The Blackbird\" and a version of \"The Sleeping Beauty\". \n\nThe poem was completed in September 1834. It was published in the second volume of Tennyson's 1842 collection of poems, along with other poems discussing the Arthurian legend. These included \"Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere\" and \"Morte d'Arthur\". The Galahad story was picked up again by Tennyson in the section \"The Holy Grail\" of \"Idylls of the King\". The later work was first published in 1869.\n\nThe poem begins with a description of Galahad that, in terms of rhythm and rhyme, is almost cheerful even though the language is not:\n\nAs the poem continues, Galahad is able to experience a vision that is preceded by a sound:\n\nThis vision includes three angels with the Holy Grail:\n\nGalahad continues by comparing the vision to light clothed in drapery:\n\nIn \"In Memoriam\", Tennyson suggests that the supernatural has to be partly known and partly unknown. In order to incorporate this idea into his poetry, Tennyson relies on a series of different characters who serve as filters to visions of truth. These characters appear in many of Tennyson's poems, with the figure of Galahad being the one who is most capable of understanding the visions. In Galahad's case, his vision is of the Holy Grail, which contains images similar to those in \"The Holy Grail\" in \"Idylls of the King\". In \"The Holy Grail\", Bors and Lancelot as well as Galahad receive visions. Of the three, Galahad is the one who best understands his abilities and his sins, and his strength allows him to complete his quest. \n\nIn terms of differences between \"Sir Galahad\" and \"The Holy Grail\", \"Sir Galahad\" depicts Galahad as prideful in regards to his abilities and to his purity, whereas \"The Holy Grail\" emphasizes that Galahad is both pious and grimly determined. Furthermore, the rhythm of \"Sir Galahad\" is almost cheerful, whereas \"The Holy Grail\" is melancholic. \"The Holy Grail\" incorporates a passage in which King Arthur begs his knights not to quest because he knows that most of them will not return. In the event, the quest does indeed mark the end of the Round Table. In the end, only Galahad is capable of completing the Grail Quest, while many of the knights are killed.\n\nAs with \"The Lady of Shalott\", \"Morte d'Arthur\", and other poems, Tennyson incorporates technical aspects of \"Sir Galahad\" into \"Idylls of the King\". The aspects that are drawn from \"Sir Galahad\" are the same as those taken from \"Morte d'Arthur\": the use of ritual. This addition allows Tennyson to create a long poem that relies on a variety of styles while containing artistic value. However, \"Idylls of the King\" varies in terms of meter and tone from \"Sir Galahad\", as the former is blank verse and the latter is a mixture of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter.\n\n"}
{"id": "333096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333096", "title": "Social history of the piano", "text": "Social history of the piano\n\nThe social history of the piano is the history of the instrument's role in society. The piano was invented at the end of the 17th century, had become widespread in Western society by the end of the 18th, and is still widely played today.\n\nAt the time of its origin around the year 1700, the piano was a speculative invention, produced by the well-paid craftsman and inventor Bartolomeo Cristofori for his wealthy patron Ferdinando de Medici, Grand Prince of Florence. As such, it was an extremely expensive item. For some time after its invention, the piano was largely owned by royalty (e.g. the kings of Portugal and Prussia); see Fortepiano for details. Even later on, (i.e. throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries), pianos were financially beyond the reach of most families, and the pianos of those times were generally the property of the gentry and the aristocracy. Visiting music masters taught their children to play the piano.\n\nBoth Parakilas and Loesser emphasize a connection during this period between pianos and the female gender; piano study was apparently more common for girls than boys. Despite this, women were discouraged from playing the piano professionally and were encouraged not to take their musical aspirations too seriously. Nevertheless, women were considered more attractive and desirable if they could play the piano. The piano was a symbol of social status, and the ability to play the piano stood as a testament to a woman's marriageability. \nWomen who had learned to play as children often continued to play as adults, thus providing music in their households. For instance, Emma Wedgwood (1808–1896), the granddaughter of the wealthy industrialist Josiah Wedgwood, took piano lessons from none other than Frédéric Chopin, and apparently achieved a fair level of proficiency. Following her marriage to Charles Darwin, Emma still played the piano daily, while her husband listened appreciatively.\n\nA number of female piano students became outright \"virtuose\", and the skills of woman pianists inspired the work of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, who dedicated difficult-to-play works to their woman friends. However, careers as concert musicians were typically open only to men (an important exception was Clara Schumann).\n\nWhen the piano was invented in 1700, it failed to catch the public's attention due to its expense and the fact that the harpsichord was the preferred instrument of the time. Very few people knew of the piano until after the Seven Years' War when a young man named Johann Zumpe fled Germany for London. While there he refined Cristofori's piano, introducing separate sections of black keys as well as treble and bass capabilities. This new piano was extremely difficult to play, and very few people learned how to play the instrument because of this. That changed when Zumpe convinced Johann Christian Bach, the personal music master to Queen Charlotte and an international celebrity, to purchase and play on a Zumpe piano for the first ever Zumpe piano concert in 1768. Because of Bach's fame, the piano soon replaced the harpsichord as the predominant instrument of the time, and later composers such as Mozart and Beethoven chose to play on a Zumpe piano. \n\nBach's fame and the interest of Queen Charlotte helped the piano become a symbol of social status. The turn of the 19th century also saw the rise of the middle class in the Western world. This middle class was eager to showcase their social status, and it became the proper Victorian man's goal to shower his wife and daughters with leisure time and leisure activities, as leisure was a symbol of social status. Consequently, the piano, which was often used for leisure, stood as a testament to a family's position on the socioeconomic ladder. \n\nOver the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, the middle class of Europe and North America increased in both numbers and prosperity. This increase produced a corresponding rise in the domestic importance of the piano, as ever more families became able to afford pianos and piano instruction. The piano also became common in public institutions, such as schools, hotels, and public houses. As elements of the Western middle-class lifestyle gradually spread to other nations, the piano became common in these nations as well, for example in Japan.\n\nTo understand the rise of the piano among the middle class, it is helpful to remember that before mechanical and electronic reproduction, music was in fact performed on a daily basis by ordinary people. For instance, the working people of every nation generated a body of folk music, which was transmitted orally down through the generations and sung by all. The parents of Joseph Haydn (1732–1809) could not read music, yet Haydn's father (who worked as a wheelwright) taught himself to play the harp, and the Haydn family frequently played and sang together. With rising prosperity, the many families that could now afford pianos and music adapted their home-grown musical abilities to the new instrument, and the piano became a major source of music in the home.\n\nAmateur pianists in the home often kept track of the doings of the leading pianists and composers of their day. Professional virtuosi wrote books and methods for the study of piano playing, which sold widely. The virtuosi also prepared their own editions of classical works, which included detailed marks of tempo and expression to guide the amateur who wanted to use their playing as a model. (Today, students are usually encouraged to work from an Urtext edition.) The piano compositions of the great composers often sold well among amateurs, despite the fact that, starting with Beethoven, they were often far too hard for anyone but a trained virtuoso to play well. Evidently, the amateur pianists obtained satisfaction from coming to grips with the finest music, even if they could not perform it from start to finish.\n\nA favourite form of musical recreation in the home was playing works for four-hand piano, in which the two players sit side by side at a single piano. These were frequently arrangements of orchestral works, and in the days before recordings served to spread knowledge of new orchestral music to places lacking an orchestra. Sometimes members of the household would sing or play other instruments along with the piano. This practice was often a part of courtship, for performing music together—particularly in the presence or at least earshot of other members of the household—was one of the few \"respectable\" ways for a young man and young woman from \"good\" families to be together.\n\nParents whose children showed unusual talent often pushed them toward professional careers, sometimes making great sacrifices to make this possible. Artur Schnabel's book \"My Life and Music\" vividly depicts his own experience along these lines, which took place in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the late 19th century.\n\nThe piano's status in the home remained secure until technology made possible the enjoyment of music in passive form. First the player piano (c. 1900), then the home phonograph (which became common in the decade before World War I), then the radio (in the 1920s) dealt severe blows to amateur piano-playing as a form of domestic recreation. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, piano sales dropped sharply, and many manufacturers went out of business. \nAnother blow to the piano was the widespread acceptance in the late 20th century of the electronic keyboard. This instrument, in its cheaper forms, is widely considered to provide only a poor substitute for the tonal quality of a good piano (see piano for why), but it is more easily portable, cheaper, much more flexible and in many ways better suited to the performance of popular music.\n\nNevertheless, the piano survives to this day in many 21st-century homes. The pianos being bought today tend to be of higher quality and more expensive than those of several decades ago, suggesting perhaps that domestic piano playing may have concentrated itself in homes of wealthier or better-educated members of the middle class. It is unlikely that ability to play the piano contributes much these days to the marriageability of daughters, but many parents still feel today that piano lessons teach their children concentration and self-discipline, and open a door into the world of classical music.\n\n"}

Despite being toys, they are able to move, think, talk, and eat, as are most of the other toys in the series. The books are notable for their intricate artwork, dark humor, and quaint, vaulted dialogue. The inspiration for books' detailed settings come from Millionaire's childhood memories of his grandparents' Victorian house. In contrast to the scabrous humor of his weekly comic strip \"Maakies\", Millionaire has said that \"\"Sock Monkey\" is me trying to rise above all that bullshit, to be more poetic, looking at the bright side, remembering the things that used to delight me as a child.\" At the same time, \"the main theme to all the \"Sock Monkey\" books is the crashing of innocent fantasy into bone-crushing reality.\"\n\nFour volumes of black-and-white \"Sock Monkey\" comics have been published; each volume consists of two issues. Volume 3 won the 2001 Eisner Award for Best Humor Publication. Volume 4 featured one issue drawn in charcoal, as opposed to the ink of the other issues, and another issue in which the character designs were changed dramatically. These comics have also been collected in two trade paperbacks, each containing two volumes: \"The Adventures of Tony Millionaire's Sock Monkey\" (2000) and \"The Collected Works of Tony Millionaire's Sock Monkey\" (2004). As of late 2006 a four-issue \"Sock Monkey\" miniseries featuring an extended story titled \"The Inches Incident\" is being released one issue at a time.\nIn addition to the \"Sock Monkey\" comics, Millionaire has also produced five other \"Sock Monkey\" books. \"Sock Monkey: A Children's Book\" (2001) and \"Sock Monkey: The Glass Doorknob\" (2002) mix comics with illustrated prose. \"Sock Monkey: Uncle Gabby\" (2004), \"That Darn Yarn\" (2005), and \"Little and Large\" (2005) are full-color, hardcover comic books. \"That Darn Yarn\" and \"Little and Large\" are both 36 pages and read much more like children's storybooks than Millionaire's other \"Sock Monkey\" comics. \n\nThe 8 issues (\"Heaven\", \"Borneo\", \"Dollhouse\", \"The Trumbernick\", \"The Hunters\", \"A Baby Bird\", \"The Oceanic Society\", and \"Heartbreak\"), \"The Inches Incident\", \"Sock Monkey: The Glass Doorknob\", and \"Sock Monkey: Uncle Gabby\" have been published together by Fantagraphics Books, Inc. in a volume known as \"Sock Monkey Treasury\" (2014). \n\nMillionaire also published an 80-page illustrated story with co-author Matt Danner under Fantagraphics Books, Inc. called \"Sock Monkey Into The Deep Woods\" (2014). This book re-tells the story of Uncle Gabby's origins (previously seen in \"Sock Monkey: A Children's Book\"), along with an adventure shared by Uncle Gabby, Mr. Crow, and Inches.\n\"Sock Monkey: A Children's Book\" and \"Sock Monkey Into The Deep Woods\" are both illustrated literature, as opposed to Millionaire's usual comics. While \"Sock Monkey: A Children's Book\" alternates between a page of text and illustration, \"Sock Monkey Into The Deep Woods\" has small illustrations interspersed throughout the prose.\n\nAll the \"Sock Monkey\" books are published by Dark Horse Comics. Dark Horse also sells a variety of \"Sock Monkey\" merchandise including stationery, t-shirts and figurines.\n\nThough the titles, format, and general ambience of the \"Sock Monkey\" books are strongly reminiscent of classic children's literature and picture books, Millionaire has emphasized that \"some of the \"Sock Monkey\" books I do are for kids, and some are definitely not.\" He describes them as being \"based on kids' books. They're for adults who remember and love great old kids' books.\"\n\nUncle Gabby: A sock monkey with a hat and a penchant for poetry. He is curious and eager to help others. Together with his friend Mr. Crow he cooks up various schemes, such as going on a salamander hunt or match-making for a widowed mouse, which tend to lead to unforeseen calamity. He is loosely connected to the character of the same name in \"Maakies\".\n\nMr. Crow: A plush crow with buttons for eyes. He has a fondness for alcohol, and is generally more brash and excitable than Uncle Gabby. Unaware that he is not a real bird, he occasionally attempts (and fails) to fly, and does not understand why other crows are not friendly toward him. Though ostensibly an alternate version of Drinky Crow from \"Maakies\", in the \"Sock Monkey\" stories he is referred to as \"Mr. Crow\" or simply \"Crow,\" never \"Drinky.\"\n\nAnn-Louise: The young girl whose home is the starting point of most of the stories (although the house itself is drawn differently each time). She owns Uncle Gabby, whom she treats very dearly, as well as most of the other toys. It is unclear whether or not she owns Mr. Crow; in the first issue he is depicted as living in the house next door, but in others he seems to live with Ann-Louise.\n\nInches: A small doll with an egotistic, inconsiderate, and bellicose personality.\n\nIn 2014, Millionaire and animator Matt Danner created an proof-of-concept short to promote an upcoming live-action/animated feature. The film, to be written and directed by Danner, would be based on the storybook \"Sock Monkey Into the Deep Woods.\" As of April 2017, they are currently shopping around Hollywood to find investors that are interested in the film.\n\n"}

An archaic historical rendering of the native ' is \"Sko-ko-mish\" but this should not be confused with the name of the Skokomish people of Washington state. Squamish is most closely related to the Sechelt, Halkomelem, and Nooksack languages.\n\nAnthropologists and linguists who have worked on the Squamish language go back to the 1880s. The first collection of words was collected by German anthropologist Franz Boas. During the following decade, anthropologist Charles Hill-Tout collected some Squamish words, sentences and stories. In the 1930s, anthropologist Homer Barnett worked with Jimmy Frank to collect information about traditional Squamish culture, including some Squamish words. In the 1950s, Dutch linguist Aert H. Kuipers worked on the first comprehensive grammar of the Squamish language, later published as \"The Squamish Language\" (1967). In 1968, the British Columbia Language Project undertook more documentation of the Squamish language and culture. Randy Bouchard and Dorothy Kennedy, the main collaborators on this project, devised the writing system presently used for Squamish. The Squamish-English bilingual dictionary (edited by Peter Jacobs and Damara Jacobs) was published by the University of Washington Press in 2011.\n\nIn 1990, the Chief and Council of the Squamish people declared Squamish to be the official language of their people, a declaration made to ensure funding for the language and its revitalization. In 2010, the First Peoples’ Heritage, Language and Culture Council considered the language to be \"critically endangered\" and \"nearly extinct\", with just ten fluent speakers. In 2011, the language was being taught using the \"Where Are Your Keys?\" technique, and a Squamish–English dictionary was also completed in 2011.\n\nA Squamish festival was scheduled for April 22, 2013, with two fluent elders, aiming to inspire more efforts to keep the language alive. Rebecca Campbell, one of the event's organizers, commented:\n\n\"The festival is part of a multi-faceted effort to ensure the language's long-term survival, not only by teaching it in the schools, but by encouraging parents to speak it at home. Squamish Nation cultural workers, for example, have begun to provide both parents and children with a list of common Squamish phrases that can be used around the home, as a way to reinforce the learning that takes place in the Sea to Sky School District schools. So far 15 families in the Squamish area are part of the program ... 'The goal is to revive the language by trying to have it used every day at home — getting the parents on board, not just the children.'\"\n\nCurrently, there are 449 Active Language Learners of the Squamish language. In 2014, a Squamish-language program was made available at Capilano University. The program, Language and Culture Certificate, is designed to let its respective students learn about the language and culture. Additionally, Simon Fraser University has launched the Squamish Language Academy, in which students learn the Squamish language for two years. The aforementioned programs increase the number of active language learners each year.\n\nThe vowel system in Squamish phonemicly features four sounds, , , , as well as a schwa sound , each with phonetic variants. There is a fair amount of overlap between the vowel spaces, with stress nd adjacency relationships as main contributors. The vowel phonemes of Squamish are listed below in IPA with the orthography following it. \n\n/i/ has four main phonetic variants [e, ɛ, ɛy, i], which surface depending on adjacency relationships to consonants, or stress.\n\n\n/a/ has four main phonetic variants [ɛ, æ, ɔ, ɑ].\n\n\n/u/ \n\n\nThe consonant phonemes of Squamish, first in IPA and then in the Squamish orthography:\n\nOther symbols include the glottal stop and stress marks.\n\nThe following table shows the vowels and consonants and their respective orthographic symbols. Vowels marked with an asterisk indicate phonological variation. Consonants are sorted by place (bilabial to uvular descending) and voicing (Left - Voiceless, Right - Voiced). Note that, Squamish contains no voiced plosives, as is typical of Salish language family languages. Because the character glyph is not found on typewriters and did not exist in most fonts until the widespread adoption of Unicode, the Squamish orthography still conventionally represents the glottal stop with the number symbol \"; the same character glyph is also used as a digit to represent the number seven.\n\nThe other special character is a stress mark, or accent (á, é, í or ú). This indicates that the vowel should be realized as louder and slightly longer.\nSquamish, like other Salish languages, has two main types of words: Clitics and full words. Clitics can be articles, or predicative clitics. Squamish words are able to be subjected to reduplication, suffixation, prefixation. A common prefix is the nominalizer prefix /s-/, which occurs in a large number of fixed combinations with verb stems to make nouns (e.g: /t'iq/ \"to be cold\" -> /s-t'iq/ \"(the) cold\"). \n\nSquamish uses a variety of reduplication types, serving to express functions such as pluralization, diminutive form, aspect, etc.\n\nSquamish sentences follow a Verb-Subject-Object form (the action precedes the initiator and the initiator of an action precedes the goal). Sentences typically begin with a predicate noun, but may also begin with a transitive, intransitive, or passive verb. \n\nThe table below summarizes the general order of elements in Squamish. Referents are nominal.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25601367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25601367", "title": "The Squire of Low Degree", "text": "The Squire of Low Degree\n\nThe Squire of Low Degree, also known as The Squyr of Lowe Degre, The Sqyr of Lowe Degre or The Sqyr of Lowe Degree, is an anonymous late Middle English or early Modern English verse romance. There is little doubt that it was intended to be enjoyed by the masses rather than the wealthy or aristocratic sections of society, and, perhaps in consequence of this, it was one of the better-known of the English romances during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, and again in the 19th century. There are three texts of the poem: it was printed by Wynkyn de Worde c. 1520 under the title \"Undo Youre Dore\", though only fragments totalling 180 lines survive of this book; around 1555 or 1560 another edition in 1132 lines was produced by William Copland; and a much shorter version, thought to have been orally transmitted, was copied into Bishop Percy's Folio Manuscript around the middle of the 17th century. The precise date of the poem is unknown, estimates varying from 1440 to 1520, but Henry Bradley's date of c. 1475 has been quite widely adopted. Standing as it does at the very end of the English Middle Ages it has been called \"a swan song of the romance\".\n\nIt was a squyer of lowe degréThat loved the kings doughter of Hungré.\nAfter seven years of undeclared love the squire opens his heart to the princess. She replies that she loves him, but that as a mere squire he will have to prove himself by fighting his way to Jerusalem and laying his sword on the Holy Sepulchre. Only this, she believes, will be enough to convince her father that they should marry. Their conversation is overheard by the king's steward, who steals off to the king to report it, and adds the malicious lie that the squire has made an attempt on the princess's virtue. The king has a good opinion of the squire and is reluctant to believe this, but tells the steward to watch the princess's room closely to see whether the squire will visit her. The squire now goes to the king to ask his leave to go abroad adventuring. On being given this permission the squire sets out, but turns aside from his way to visit the princess's chamber and make his farewells. There, finding the steward and a numerous body of men-at-arms lying in wait for him, he asks the princess to let him in.\nBut she, as a virtuous unmarried lady, turns him from her door and tells him to win her in marriage. Now the steward and his men approach the chamber to take the squire prisoner. Though he resists to such good effect that the steward is killed, the squire is finally taken prisoner by the steward's men. These men mutilate the dead steward's face, dress him in the squire's clothes, and leave him at the princess's door hoping she will mistake him for the squire. The princess is taken in by this trick, embalms the body of the dead steward and keeps it in a tomb by her bed. Meanwhile the squire is taken to the king, who imprisons him. Finally, finding that his daughter is inconsolable, the king releases the squire and allows him to go abroad.\nAnone the squyer passed the se.In Tuskayne and in Lumbardy,There he dyd great chyvalry.In Portyngale nor yet in Spayne,There myght no man stand hym agayne;And where that ever that knyght gan fare,The worshyp with hym away he bare.And thus he travayled seven yereIn many a land bothe farre and nere,Tyll on a day he thought hym thoUnto the sepulture for to go.And there he made his offerynge soone,Right as the kinges doughter bad him don.\nHaving done all this he returns to Hungary. Here the princess, still lamenting her supposedly dead lover, has decided to retire from the world:\nHer father now belatedly tells her that she has been mourning the steward, and that the squire has returned from Jerusalem. He gives the lovers his blessing, and they marry.\n\nThere are many references to the poem in the works of Edmund Spenser, Beaumont and Fletcher, and other Elizabethan writers – Shakespeare, for example, alludes to the poem when, in \"Henry V\", Act V, sc. i, Fluellen says \"You called me yesterday mountain-squire, but I will make you to-day a squire of low degree\" – but as the 17th century advanced the poem fell into neglect. In the mid-18th century Thomas Percy acquired the famous Folio Manuscript, with its version of \"The Squire of Low Degree\", and came to the mistaken conclusion that the poem was one of the romances satirised by Chaucer in his \"Tale of Sir Thopas\", and must therefore have been written in the 14th century. He communicated these opinions together with an extract from \"The Squire of Low Degree\" to his friend Thomas Warton, who included them in the 1762 edition of his \"Observations on the Fairy Queen of Spenser\". Percy planned to edit \"The Squire\" as part of a proposed collection of \"Ancient English and Scottish Poems\", but this plan fell through, and it was left to the medievalist Joseph Ritson to make the Copland text available to general readers in 1802 in his \"Ancient Engleish Metrical Romanceës\" [sic]. Walter Scott refers to the poem in several of his novels, and it particularly influences his \"Quentin Durward\" and \"The Fair Maid of Perth\", in each of which the hero finds himself in a situation so parallel to that of the squire that he cannot help identifying with him. Thomas Love Peacock and George Eliot both used quotations from \"The Squire\" as epigraphs – to chapter 3 of \"Crotchet Castle\" and chapter 62 of \"Middlemarch\" respectively. The bibliographer William Carew Hazlitt produced another edition of the Copland text in his \"Remains of the Early Popular Poetry of England\" (1864–1866), and shortly afterwards the Folio MS text was published for the first time by John W. Hales and Frederick J. Furnivall in their edition of \"Bishop Percy's Folio Manuscript\" (1867–1868). James Russell Lowell wrote that the romance \"Has passages that are unsurpassed in simple beauty by anything in our earlier poetry.\" William Edward Mead, in his standard edition of the romance, published in 1904, expressed an opinion closer to that of most modern critics when he said that \nWe can praise \"The Squyr of Lowe Degre\" only with considerable reservations, and do not seek a place for it among the great creative poems of the world. But it is interesting, at times charming, and it more than holds its own among poems of its class.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8851941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8851941", "title": "Virtus", "text": "Virtus\n\nVirtus was a specific virtue in Ancient Rome. It carries connotations of valor, manliness, excellence, courage, character, and worth, perceived as masculine strengths (from Latin \"vir\", \"man\"). It was thus a frequently stated virtue of Roman emperors, and was personified as a deity—Virtus.\n\nThe origins of the word \"virtus\" can be traced back to the Latin word \"vir\", \"man\". The common list of attributes associated with \"virtus\" are typically perceived masculine strengths, which may indicate its derivation from \"vir\". From the early to the later days of the Roman Empire, there appears to have been a development in how the concept was understood. \n\nOriginally \"virtus\" was used to describe specifically martial courage, but it eventually grew to be used to describe a range of Roman virtues. It was often divided into different qualities including \"prudentia\" (prudence), \"iustitia\" (justice), \"temperantia\" (temperance, self-control), and \"fortitudo\" (courage). This division of virtue as a whole into cardinal virtues is today classified as virtue ethics, as described by Plato's \"Republic\" and Aristotle's \"Nicomachean Ethics\". It implies a link between \"virtus\" and the Greek concept of \"arete\".\n\nThis inclusion leads to the belief that at one time \"virtus\" extended to cover a wide range of meanings that covered one general ethical ideal. The use of the word began to grow and shift to fit the new idea of what manliness meant.\nNo longer did \"virtus\" mean that a person was a brave warrior but it could also mean that he was a good man, someone who did the right thing. During the time of the decline of the Roman elite \"virtus\" the Roman upper class no longer thought of themselves as unmanly if they did not serve in the military.\n\nVirtue as described by Aristotle was rediscovered in the medieval age by Muslim philosopher Averroes, which in turn influenced Thomas Aquinas to fuse virtue and ethics with Christianity in connection with the Renaissance of the 12th century.\n\n\"Virtus\" comes from the aristocratic tradition in which it is a specific type of public conduct. It is really only applicable in the \"cursus honorum\", certainly by the late republic at least. It is not a \"private\" virtue in the way that modern people might consider it. Valor, courage, and manliness are not things that can be pursued in the private sphere of the individual or the individual's private concerns. There could be no virtue in exploiting one's manliness in the pursuit of personal wealth, for example. \"Virtus\" is exercised in the pursuit of \"gloria\" for the benefit of the \"res publica\" resulting in the winning of eternal \"memoria\". According to D.C. Earl \"Outside the service of the \"res publica\" there can be no \"magistratus\" and therefore, strictly speaking, no \"gloria\", no \"nobilitas\", no \"virtus\"\".\n\nFor the nobility \"virtus\" lies not only in one's personal \"acta\" but also that of one's ancestors. However Cicero, a \"novus homo\", asserted that \"virtus\" was a virtue particularly suited to the new man just as nobilitas was suited to the noble. Cicero argued that just as young men from noble families won the favor of the people so too should the novus homo earn the favor of the people with his \"virtus\". He even extended the argument that \"virtus\" and not one’s family history should decide a man’s worthiness. \"Virtus\" is something that a man earns himself, not something that is given to him by his family, thus it is a better measure of a man’s ability. Cicero's goal was not to impugn the noble class but widen it to include men who had earned their positions by merit.\n\nThe term was used quite significantly by the historian Sallust, a contemporary of Cicero. Sallust asserted that it did not rightfully belong to the \"nobilitas\" as a result of their family background but specifically to the \"novus homo\" through the exercise of \"ingenium\" (talent). For Sallust and Cicero alike, \"virtus\" is situated in the winning of glory by the execution of illustrious deeds (\"egregia facinora\") and the observance of right conduct through \"bonae artes\".\n\n\"Virtus\" was not universally applicable to just anyone – generally (although not always exclusively) only adult male Roman citizens would be thought of as possessing \"virtus\".\n\n\"Virtus\" was rarely attributed to women, likely because of its association with \"vir\". The highest regarded female virtue was \"pudicitia\": \"modesty\" or \"chastity\". Cicero, however, attributes this characteristic to females several times. He uses it once to describe Caecilia Metella when she helps a man who is being chased by assassins. Twice more he uses it when describing his daughter, Tullia, portraying her in his letters as brave in his absence. He uses it again to describe his first wife Terentia during his exile.\nLivy in Book 2 attributes it to Cloelia.\n\n\"Virtus\" was not a term commonly used to describe children. Since \"virtus\" was primarily attributed to a full grown man who had served in the military, children were not particularly suited to obtain this particular virtue.\n\nWhile a slave was able to be \"homo\" (\"man\") he was not considered a \"vir\". Slaves were often referred to as \"puer\" (Latin for \"boy\") to denote that they were not citizens. Since a slave could not be a \"vir\" it follows that they would not be allowed to have the quality of \"virtus\". Once a slave was manumitted he was able to become a \"vir\" and he was also classified as a freedman but this did not allow him to have \"virtus\". A good slave or freedman was said to have \"fides\", but no \"virtus\".\n\nForeigners in the Roman world could be attributed with \"virtus\": If they fought bravely they could be said to have \"virtus\". \"Virtus\" could also be lost in battle. \"Virtus\" could even be a cause to gain citizenship as in the case of Spanish cavalry men granted citizenship by Cn. Pompeius Strabo in 89 BC for their \"virtus\" in battle.\n\n\"Virtus\" applies exclusively to a man's behaviour in the public sphere, i.e. to the application of duty to the \"res publica\" in the \"cursus honorum\". His private business was no place to earn \"virtus\", even when it involved courage or feats of arms or other qualities associated to it if performed for the public good.\n\nWhile in many cultures around the world it is considered \"manly\" to father and provide for a family, family life was considered in the Roman world to be part of the private sphere. During this time there was no place for \"virtus\" in the private sphere. Most uses of \"virtus\" to describe any part of private life are ambiguous and often refer to another similar quality. In the Roman world the oldest living patriarch of the family was called the \"pater familias\" and this title implied that he was able to make all legal and binding decisions for the family; he also owned all the money, land, and other property. His wife, daughters, sons, and his sons’ families were all under his \"potestas\". The only time a son was seen as separate from his father's control in the eyes of other Romans was when he assumed his public identity as a citizen. He could earn his \"virtus\" by serving in the military, and thus could only demonstrate manliness outside of the family setting. This is another reason that \"virtus\" is not often used to describe the Roman private life.\n\n\"Virtus\" was a crucial component for a political career. Its broad definition led to it being used to describe a number of qualities that the Roman people idealized in their leaders.\n\nIn everyday life a typical Roman, especially a young boy, would have been inculcated with the idea of \"virtus\". Since military service was a part of most Roman men's life, military training would have started fairly early. Young boys would have learned how to wield weapons and military tactics starting at home with their fathers and older male relatives and later in school. Also as a young boy one would have heard numerous stories about past heroes, battles, and wars. Some of these stories would have surely told of the \"virtus\" of past heroes, and even family members. Publicly it was easy to see the rewards of \"virtus\". Public triumphs were held for victorious generals and rewards were given to brave fighters. All of this propaganda would have encouraged young boys coming into their manhood to be brave fighters and earn the attribute of \"virtus\". It was the duty of every generation of men to maintain the \"dignitas\" which his family had already earned and enlarge it. This pressure to live up to the standards of one’s ancestors was great. In achieving \"virtus\" one could achieve \"gloria\". By gaining \"virtus\" and \"gloria\" one could hope to aspire to high political office and great renown.\n\nWhile young boys were encouraged to earn \"virtus\" there were also limits put on showing \"virtus\" in public. \"Virtus\" was often associated with being aggressive and this could be very dangerous in the public sphere and the political world. Displays of violent \"virtus\" were controlled through several methods. Men seeking to hold political office typically had to follow the \"cursus honorum\". Many political offices had an age minimum which ensured that the men filling the positions had the proper amount of experience in the military and in government. This meant that even if a man proved himself capable of filling a position or was able to persuade people that he was capable, he would not necessarily be able to hold the position until he had reached a certain age. This also served to ensure that in elections of public offices no one had a certain advantage over another person because by the time most men went into public office they would have retired from military service. Furthermore, before any Roman soldier could partake in single combat he had to gain permission from his general. This procedure was meant to keep soldiers from putting themselves in extremely dangerous situations that they may or may not have been able to handle in order gain \"virtus\".\n\nThe concept of \"virtus\" also tended to be a concept of morality as far as politics were concerned. This could range from the very literal definition of manliness seen in aggression and the ruthless acquisition of money, land, and power, or the lighter, more idealistic political meaning which almost took on the extended meaning of \"pietas\", a man who was morally upright and concerned with the matters of the state. Plautus in \"Amphitruo\" contrasted \"virtus\" and \"ambitio\". Virtus is seen as a positive attribute, though \"ambitio\" itself is not necessarily a negative attribute but is often associated with negative methods such as bribery. Plautus said that just as great generals and armies win victory by \"virtus\", so should political candidates. \"Ambitio\" “is the wrong method of reaching a good end.” Part of \"virtus\", in the political sphere was to deal justly in every aspect of one’s life, especially in political and state matters.\n\nAlthough the two concepts are related, \"virtus\", for the Roman, did not necessarily emphasize the behavior that the associations of the present-day English term 'virtue' suggest. \"Virtus\" was to be found in the context of 'outstanding deeds' (\"egregia facinora\"), and brave deeds were the accomplishments which brought \"gloria\" ('a reputation'). This \"gloria\" was attached to two ideas: \"fama\" ('what people think of you') and \"dignitas\" ('one's standing in the community'). The struggle for \"virtus\" in Rome was above all a struggle for public office (\"honos\"), since it was through aspiring to high office, to which one was elected by the People, that a man could best show his manliness by means of military achievement which would in turn cultivate a reputation and votes. It was the duty of every aristocrat and would-be aristocrat to maintain the \"dignitas\" which his family had already achieved and to extend it to the greatest possible degree, through higher political office and military victories. This system resulted in a strong built-in impetus in Roman society to engage in military expansion and conquest at all times.\n\nWhile in many cultures the virtue of manliness is also seen as being partly sexual, in the Roman world \"virtus\" apparently did not have sexual connotations. Similar words deriving from the same stem often have sexual connotations. In the Roman world \"virtus\" dealt with a great many areas such as martial courage, honor, and being morally upright rather than sexual manliness.\n\nOne of the most well known demonstrations of \"virtus\" was shown by Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus. Before Cincinnatus was appointed dictator in 458 BC, Rome was in the midst of a battle with the Aequi and needed someone to take control. Messengers sent to fetch him found him plowing in his field. Upon being informed of the appointment, he wept saying, \"So my field will be unsown this year, and we shall be in danger of not having enough food to support us.\" Nevertheless, he dutifully gathered his things, kissed his wife goodbye and departed to raise an army and defeat the Aequi in a mere fifteen days. Upon returning home after the victory, Cincinnatus picked up the plough from where he left it and began plowing again. Dionysius of Halicarnassus recounts this story to illustrate the type of leaders the men of Rome were. He says that they “worked with their hands, led self-disciplined lives, did not complain about honorable poverty, and far from pursuing positions of royal power.”\n\nPompey is another prominent example of \"virtus\". In 55 BC, Pompey inaugurated his grand theatre complex and dedicated several shrines to different gods, one of these being \"Virtus\". This consecrated Pompey’s link with \"virtus\". He gained a reputation with the public as being a man of \"virtus\". Cicero, throughout his speech, the \"De imperio Cn. Pompei\", connects Pompey with \"divina virtus\". Pompey was so closely connected with \"virtus\" that once during a production of a play at the \"Ludi Apollinares\" one of the characters spoofed Pompey by stating \"eandem virtutem istam veniet tempus cum graviter gemes\": \"The time will come when you bitterly resent that same \"virtus\"\". The audience did not need to hear his name to know that Pompey was being referenced.\n\nM. Claudius Marcellus, during the battle of Clastidium in 222 BC, dedicated a temple to Honos and Virtus. This was one of the first times that \"Virtus\" had been recognized as divine. The connection with \"Honos\" would have been obvious to most Romans as demonstrations of \"virtus\" led to election to public office and both were considered \"honos\". The cult of \"Honos\" was already a long-standing tradition in Rome. The marriage of the two deities ensured that \"Virtus\" would also get proper respect from the Romans. But an objection by the pontiffs was that one temple could not properly house two gods because there would be no way of knowing which god to sacrifice to should a miracle happen in the temple.\n\nDuring the reign of Augustus, the Senate voted that a golden shield be inscribed with Augustus’ attributes and displayed in the Curia Iulia, including \"virtus\", \"clementia\", \"iustitia\", and \"pietas\". These political catchwords continued to be used as propaganda by later emperors.\n\nThe comic poet Plautus made use of the concept of \"virtus\" in his play \"Trinummus\" which concerned family \"virtus\", honor and public office, and obligations to the state. He also offered commentary on the concept of \"virtus\" in \"Amphitruo\" (see above \"Virtus and the Public\").\n\n\n"}

A \"warung\" is an essential part of daily life in Indonesia. Today, the term \"warung\" has slightly shifted — especially among foreign visitors, expatriates, and people abroad — to refer more specifically to a modest Indonesian restaurant or a place that sells things Indonesian (mostly groceries or foodstuff). But for the majority of Indonesians, the meaning is still a small, neighborhood convenience shop, often a front room in a family's home. \n\nThere are establishments on the touristy island of Bali and elsewhere that attach the term \"warung\" in their business to indicate their Indonesian nature. Traditionally, \"warung\" is indeed a family-owned business, run by the family members, mostly by women.\n\nTraditional warungs are made from wooden, bamboo or thatched materials. More permanent warungs are made from bricks and concrete, some family-owned businesses are attached to their homes. Some smaller portable warungs are made from tin, zinc or some modern version might use fiberglass mold. \"Warung tenda\" is a portable tent warung, covered with canvas, fabric, tarp or plastic sheet tent for roofing.\n\nThe term \"warung\" simply denotes a wide category of small businesses, either a small shop or small restaurant. It is widely used in Java and most of Indonesia. In certain parts of Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, the word \"kedai\" is sometimes used as well. In Javanese culture areas, such as in Yogyakarta, Semarang and Surakarta, its counterpart term \"angkringan\" is more commonly found. On the other hand, the term \"toko\" is used for a larger and more established shop.\n\nThe term can be used to loosely refer to many other types of shops, including the \"wartel\" (short for \"warung telepon\", essentially a manned phone booth) and \"warnet\" (short for \"warung internet\" Internet café).\n\nThere are many kinds of warung, some take the form of a small shop that sells cold bottled drinks, candy, cigarettes, snacks, \"krupuk\" and other daily necessities, while the larger ones are small restaurant establishments. A warung that sells food typically sells local food; \"pisang goreng\" and many kinds of \"gorengan, nasi goreng\" (fried rice), and \"mie goreng\" (fried noodles).\n\nIn resort island of Bali and Lombok, a warung might refer to a touristy cabana cafe that sells locals' favourites as well as Asian or western food. Other than Indonesian dishes, on their menu there might be a selection of soups, steaks, fries, sandwiches or grilled fish.\n\nSome types of warung are:\n\nMost of the time, warung are named after the main dishes they sell. For example, warung bubur kacang ijo or warung burjo sells bubur kacang hijau, warung roti bakar sells grilled bread, warung pecel lele sells \"pecel lele\" or fried catfish with sambal, while warung indomie sells cooked instant noodles, although the brand might not always be Indomie.\n\n\n"}

He first rose to prominence in 1970, as the secretary of the Donegall Road Defence Committee, at which time he was also active in Ian Paisley's Protestant Unionist Party (PUP).\n\nDickson was a founder member of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the successor to the PUP. He was elected to Belfast City Council in 1977, and again stood for the party in Belfast West at the 1979 UK general election, taking third place with 11.2% of the vote. He was able to hold his council seat in 1981.\n\nDickson was selected as a candidate for Belfast West at the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election. Six weeks before the election, he was shot at his home by members of the Irish National Liberation Army. He survived the attack, although he was unable to take part in the remainder of the election campaign, and narrowly failed to win election.\n\nAlthough Dickson was re-elected at the 1985 local election, and served as Deputy Lord Mayor of Belfast in 1986, he then left the DUP and stood as an independent Unionist in 1989 local election, losing his seat. He subsequently joined the Conservatives in Northern Ireland, but again missed election when he stood for them in 1993.\n\nOutside politics, Dickson long worked at the Ulster Museum, but later became a tour guide, specialising in the history of Belfast and the Ulster Covenant. He served as a Royal Ulster Constabulary Reservist, and from 2007 had a weekly column in the \"South Belfast Community Telegraph\".\n\nDickson later joined Traditional Unionist Voice, and at the Northern Ireland local elections, 2014, he stood unsuccessfully for the party in Botanic. He subsequently left the party, and in 2016 formed his own organisation, South Belfast Unionists, for which he stood in Belfast South at the Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2016, taking 351 first preference votes.\n"}
{"id": "26830376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26830376", "title": "You Have 0 Friends", "text": "You Have 0 Friends\n\n\"You Have 0 Friends\" is the fourth episode of the 14th season of the American animated television series \"South Park\", and the 199th episode of the series overall. It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 7, 2010. In the episode, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny make Stan a Facebook profile against his will and he becomes extremely frustrated with everyone asking him for friend requests. After he gets fed up with Facebook, Stan tries to delete his profile but is sucked into a virtual Facebook world. Meanwhile, Kyle starts trying to find ways to get more friends on Facebook after he drastically starts losing them due to his befriending of a third-grade friendless Facebook user, whom everyone considers a loser.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by co-creator Trey Parker and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. \"You Have 0 Friends\" features several references to the popular social networking service Facebook, and Stan's plotline parodies the 1982 Disney film \"Tron\" with Stan in the role of Kevin Flynn, and its climax borrows from the climax of the 2009 film \"Summer Wars\". The episode also parodies the CNBC series \"Mad Money\", as well as the online chat website Chatroulette, and the social network game \"FarmVille\".\n\n\"You Have 0 Friends\" has received positive reviews from critics, and according to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was viewed by 3.071 million viewers and became the cable lead in the 18–49 Wednesday night.\n\nKyle, Cartman and Kenny surprise Stan by creating a Facebook account for him. Stan protests, but is quickly pressured by family and friends to add them as friends. To his annoyance and frustration, Stan finds people such as Randy, his grandmother and even Wendy confronting him over his supposed disregard for them and judging his real-world friendship solely by his Facebook configuration. Meanwhile, Kyle adds shy nerdy student Kip Drordy (anagram: Dorky Drip) to his thriving friends list out of pity. Kyle's number of Facebook friends rapidly declines when he does this, in part due to a \"Mad Friends\" podcast he finds Cartman has set up in which he berates Kyle for choosing a loser as a friend and asserts nobody will want to hang out with Kyle. Kyle understands this, but, on principle and out of pity, cannot bring himself to delete Kip to please others. Desperate to stem the loss of friends, he asks Cartman for advice. Cartman introduces Kyle to Chatroulette as a way to make new friends, which fails as most of the people on the site are online predators (either masturbating or flashing their genitals), until Cartman finally finds another Jewish kid named Isiah, who agrees to be Kyle's friend, much to Kyle's delight.\n\nMeanwhile, Stan now has 845,323 friends (almost all of whom he hardly knows or does not know) on his account and has finally decided to delete it, only to find that Facebook refuses to allow him to. Instead of deleting his account, Stan is forcibly transported by the software into the virtual world of Facebook, where he meets \"profiles\" of everyone he knows who communicate in Facebook lingo, and is forced to engage in Facebook activities such as Yahtzee. Unexpectedly winning on the first roll, Stan escapes and finds his way to Kyle's \"Farm Town\" farm, blaming Kyle for getting him \"sucked into Facebook\" in the first place. Stan orders Kyle to check out his profile status and Kyle finds out that Stan is supposedly hosting a party elsewhere in Facebook at \"Café World\". Kyle makes it to Stan's party, only to find that Isiah has refused to be his friend because of Kip. Desperate to retain some friends, Kyle finally deletes Kip, leaving him with no friends. Kip, too, is disheartened to find his friend has abandoned him.\n\nAt the party, Stan encounters his online profile, which has the form of a huge monstrous version of himself. It challenges him to a game of Yahtzee and Stan wins, again on the first roll, causing the profile to be finally deleted. The victory returns Stan to the real world once more. He now has no Facebook friends, and Randy, upon realizing that Stan is no longer his friend, asks Stan why he deleted him. Stan explains what just happened to him and that he has \"sent all his friends somewhere else\". Back at Kip's house, Kip is still depressed about Kyle deleting him as a friend, but is then overjoyed when all 845,323 friends Stan had prior to deletion are suddenly transferred to his account as friends.\n\n\"You Have 0 Friends\" was written and directed by co-series creator Trey Parker. He came up with the episode after signing up for Facebook and actually being sucked into it until people were angry that he did not respond to anyone on Facebook. He came up with the idea of doing something similar to \"Tron\".\nThe episode prominently features several aspects of the online website Facebook, including the Facebook games \"Farmville\", \"Café World\" and a digital version of the Milton Bradley game Yahtzee. Also, many aspects of the virtual Facebook world Stan gets sucked into in the episode parody the film \"Tron\". Stan's Facebook account is based on the Master Control Program. Cartman's podcast, \"Mad Friends\", is a parody of a segment from the financial show \"Mad Money\" hosted by Jim Cramer on CNBC.\n\n\"You Have 0 Friends\" originally aired on April 7, 2010, with a TV-MA rating in the United States, on Comedy Central. In its original American broadcast, it was watched by 3.071 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. This made it the second most viewed cable show of the night after \"In Plain Sight\" and attracting more viewers than the previous episode, \"Medicinal Fried Chicken\". The episode also received an 18–49 rating of 1.7 and a share of 5% edging out \"Tyler Perry's House of Payne\" for the cable lead in the demographic.\n\nThe episode received generally positive reviews from critics. \"The Indiana Daily Student\"'s Brian Welk called the episode \"fairly enjoyable,\" joking that his Facebook status would say that he \"hopes the 200th episode [of \"South Park\"] is as good as the Facebook one!\" Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said \"The half-hour was shrewdly precise in its targets: The older audience that communes on Facebook (such as parents and grandparents) as well as lonely kids; as usual, \"South Park\" is merciless when it smells a baby-boomer-adopted trend.\" Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode a 9/10, calling it \"brilliant from beginning to end, and one of the best episodes the series has served up in a while.\" Carlos Delgado of \"iF Magazine\" wrote that \"\"You have 0 Friends\" has the right amount of humor, intelligence, and sarcasm to match any \"South Park\" episode. The question is, does it become an instant classic?\" Cristina Everett of the \"New York Daily News\" called the episode \"hilarious, yet heartwarming\", adding that the Kip Drordy subplot was \"endearing\".\n\nThere have been less favorable reviews of \"You Have 0 Friends\" that criticize the use of its cultural Facebook jokes. TV Fanatic, who gave the episode 3/5, said there was \"too much Facebook\" in the episode and that \"it was a great parody, but just a decent episode that could have had more LOL moments\". Grading it a D+, The A.V. Club's Todd VanDerWerff opined the episode \"mostly made all of the jokes about [Facebook] that the rest of us did back when Facebook first invaded all of our lives. It doesn't give me high hopes for the inevitable Twitter episode the show does in 2013.\"\n\n\"You Have 0 Friends\", along with the thirteen other episodes from \"South Park\"'s fourteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on April 26, 2011.\n\n"}
