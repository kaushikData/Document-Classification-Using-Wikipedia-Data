Such groups are also known non-stratified societies. Typically these societies are small-scale, organized into bands or tribes that make decisions through consensus decision making rather than appointing permanent chiefs or kings. Most foraging or hunter-gatherer societies are acephalous . Some exceptions to this trend are the Indus River Valley Civilization, Minoan Crete and the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture.\n\nWhen these societies do not possess distinctions of rank, they are described as egalitarian. \n\nIn scientific literature covering native African societies and the effect of European colonialism on them the term is often used to describe groups of people living in a settlement with \"no government in the sense of a group able to exercise effective control over both the people and their territory\". In this respect the term is also often used as synonymous to \"stateless society\". Such societies are described as consensus-democratic in opposition to the majority-democratic systems of the West.\n\nThe Igbo Nation in West Africa is alleged to be an acephalous or egalitarian society.\n\n\n"}

It is the sequel to \"Akiba's Trip\" on the PlayStation Portable. A third game in the series, \"Akiba's Trip Festa\", has been released on November 2016.\n\n \n\nIn \"Akiba's Trip\", the player explores Akihabara and strip the clothes off \"Synthisters\". There are different things to do such as buy items from shops, enter maid cafes to eat food and play games, or head to the battle arena to train and increase your rank, eventually being about to fight Antoinette. The player character is customizable, with the player able to pick what headgear and clothing to wear, and what walking style and stripping style to use. Character models, voices and skin color are unlocked when beating the game, with some being unlocked when finishing the game with certain endings. Non-playable characters consist of otakus, tourists, maids and more along with \"Synthisters\" who can be seen with the mobile app Shion developed which is unlocked later in the game. The story is played out as a visual novel where the player gets to choose from three different phrases to say to progress the story, akin to the \"Way of the Samurai\" series, also developed by Acquire. Certain options will increase the player character's affection level with certain characters that will diverge into different endings for the player to experience. A hint system is unlocked when beating the game to ensure that the affection level will increase for the character that the player chooses.\n\nWhen initiated into battle, the player chooses what weapon to use. The player aims attacks at the lower, middle or upper part of the body to weaken the enemy's clothing, with each body part having their own respective button. There is a combo attack when pressing the attack button repeatedly, a forward attack for moving the analog forward while attacking, a strong attack for moving the analog back while attacking along with an aerial attack and guard attack. Guarding dodges all attacks but leaves the player character vulnerable to having their clothes stripped but the player can also counter-attack the \"Synthister's\" attack or if their clothing is flashing, can counter-strip their clothes. When the clothes are flashing, the player can hold the attack button to strip the clothes off but if the clothes are not flashing, they can hold the button and then mash it to force strip it. The more the player strips a certain type of clothing, their strip skill will increase, allowing the clothes not to tear so that they can keep the clothing for inventory. If the meter on the top left of the screen is filled and if the player is allied with Shizuku, Touka, Kati, Shion or Nana, they can perform a unison strip, where they do heavy damage to a \"Synthister\" and cause the other \"Synthisters\" to be dizzy, stripping them until they are no longer dizzy or the chain strip ends.\n\nSet in Akihabara, the shopping area has been invaded by creatures known as \"Synthisters\" who prey on the patrons of Akihabara, feasting on their social energy and will to live. These enemies can only be stopped by direct exposure to sunlight, meaning that the player is required to defeat these synthisters by violently stripping off their clothes and exposing them to sunlight. The storyline revolves around a conspiracy behind the Magaimono organization that the player explores. Within the game, there will be over 130 real life Akihabara shops that the player is able to visit.\n\n\nDevelopment of the game was first announced in \"Famitsu\" in August 2013. An official trailer was released on 29 August 2013, introducing the main gameplay concepts, including a feature which allows two characters to strip an enemy's clothes off in unison.\n\n\"Akiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed\" has been localised into Chinese and Korean with the assistance of Sony Computer Entertainment Japan. The game features collaboration DLC in the form of character costumes and equippable items, including those from \"Ragnarok Odyssey Ace\", \"Disgaea\", \"Hyperdimension Neptunia\", \"The Legend of Heroes\", \"Super Sonico\", and \"Genshiken\".\n\nXSEED Games localized the game in North America and released it on August 12, 2014 on the PS3 and Vita, with the PS4 version following in late 2014. NIS America released the game in Europe on October 10, 2014. XSEED Games' western localization of the game features original Japanese audio and text, and Japanese advertising for real-life Akihabara locations and products within the original game will remain. The physical version shipped with dual audio, with the game being stored on a 4GB Vita cart.\n\nDuring the first week of release in Japan, \"Akiba's Trip 2\" sold 33,476 PlayStation Vita physical retail copies and 20,230 PlayStation 3 physical retail copies, ranking at fourth and eighth place respectively amongst all software sales that week in Japan. \"Famitsu\" gave both the PS3 and Vita versions of the game a review score of 33/40.\n\nFollowing the game's release in the west, reception among reviewers have been mixed. Crunchyroll noted that the game features a significant amount of content and provides an authentic feel of Akihabara, however does have issues with its combat system. Cinema Blend rated the game 3.5 out of 5, noting it to be a unique game unlike any other game on the market, and Just Push Start gave a score of 9.3, praising the manner in which the setting is presented. Digital Trends. \"Hardcore Gamer\" rated the game a 3.5/5 praising the gameplay and amount of content, but criticizing the technical problems and fan-service. They also stated that \"Akiba is an open-world game, but it’s hard to fully get lost in it because of how many loading screens you run into when traveling from section to section of the city.\" Cubed3 gave it 5/10, stating, \"Fun characters and a creative concept for combat with an immense amount of character customization are all undermined by the terribly executed and jerky unpolished gameplay.\" Upon its PC release, HonestGamers praised the game's lampooning of a source material it clearly loved though noted the battle system was \"gloriously clumsy\", ultimately awarding it 4/5.\n"}

As well as the entertainment, the óenach was an occasion on which kings and notables met under truce and where laws were pronounced and confirmed.\n\nThe Aonach had three functions; honoring the dead, proclaiming laws, and funeral games and festivities to entertain. The first function took between one and three days depending on the importance of the deceased, guests would sing mourning chants called the \"Guba\" after which druids would improvise songs in memory of the dead called a \"Cepóg\". The dead would then be burnt on a funeral pyre. The second function would then be carried out by the Ollamh Érenn, giving out laws to the people via bards and druids and culminating in the igniting of another massive fire. The custom of rejoicing after a funeral was then enshrined in the \"Cuiteach Fuait\", games of mental and physical ability accompanied by a large market for traders. \n\nThe most notable fair, that held under the auspices of the High King of Ireland and the Uí Néill, was the \"Óenach Tailten\" or \"Tailteann Games\", which is given prehistoric origins by medieval writers. This was held at Teltown, in modern County Meath, as late as 1770. The compilers of the Irish annals considered violence and disorders at this óenach, or the failure of the incumbent High King to hold the fair, to be of note. The Irish Free State held revivals of the Tailteann Games from 1924 to 1932. \n\nOther important assemblies included that of Tlachtga, held on the Hill of Ward at Samhain, that of Carman, held in County Wexford, that of Uisnech, held at Beltane and that of Raigne in Osraige. Not all had pagan calendrical associations. The \"Óenach Colmáin\", probably held at Lynally, was named for Saint Elo Colman.\n\n\n"}

Pandya (?) or Pandita (?) ) to Caesar Augustus sometime between 22 BC and 13 AD. The embassy was travelling with a diplomatic letter on a skin in Greek, and one of its members was a sramana who burned himself alive in Athens to demonstrate his faith. The event made a sensation and was described by Nicolaus of Damascus, who met the embassy at Antioch (near present day Antakya in Turkey) and related by Strabo (XV,1,73 ) and Dio Cassius (liv, 9). A tomb was made to the sramana, still visible in the time of Plutarch, which bore the mention:\n\nStrabo also states that Nicolaus of Damascus in giving the details of his tomb inscription specified his name was \"Zarmanochegas\" and he \"immortalized himself according to the custom of his country.\" Cassius Dio (\"Hist\" 54.9) and Plutarch cite the same story Charles Eliot in his \"Hinduism and Buddhism: An Historical Sketch (1921)\" considers that the name Zarmanochegas \"perhaps contains the two words Sramana and Acarya.\" HL Jones' translation of the inscription as mentioned by Strabo reads it as \"The Sramana master, an Indian, a native of Bargosa, having immortalized himself according to the custom of his country, lies here.\"\nThese accounts at least indicate that Indian religious men (Sramanas, to which the Buddhists belonged, as opposed to Hindu Brahmanas) were circulating in the Levant during the time of Jesus.\n\nBy the time of Jesus, the teachings of the Buddha had already spread through much of India and penetrated into Sri Lanka, Central Asia and China. They display certain similarities to Christian moral precepts of more than five centuries later; the sanctity of life, compassion for others, rejection of violence, confession and emphasis on charity and the practice of virtue.\n\nWill Durant, noting that the Emperor Ashoka sent missionaries, not only to elsewhere in India and to Sri Lanka, but to Syria, Egypt and Greece, speculated in the 1930s that they may have helped prepare the ground for Christian teaching.\n\nAshoka ascended the throne of India around 270 BC. After his conversion to Buddhism he dispatched missionaries to the four points of the compass. Archeological finds indicate these missions had been \"favorably received\" in lands to the West.\n\nPtolemy II Philadelphus, one of the monarchs Ashoka mentions in his edicts, is recorded by Pliny the Elder as having sent an ambassador named Dionysius to the Mauryan court at Pataliputra: \"India has been treated of by several other Greek writers who resided at the courts of Indian kings, such, for instance, as Megasthenes, and by Dionysius, who was sent thither by Philadelphus, expressly for the purpose: all of whom have enlarged upon the power and vast resources of these nations.\"\n\nRecords from Alexandria, long a crossroads of commerce and ideas, indicate that itinerant monks from the Indian subcontinent may have influenced philosophical currents of the time. Roman accounts centuries later speak of monks traveling to the middle east, and there is mention of an embassy sent by the Indian king Pandion, or Porus (possibly Pandya), to Caesar Augustus around 13 AD (see \"Pandion Embassy\" section above).\n\nMeanwhile, the Buddha's teachings had spread north-west, into Parthian territory. Buddhist stupa remains have been identified as distant as the Silk Road city of Merv. Soviet archeological teams in Giaur Kala, near Merv, have uncovered a Buddhist monastery, complete with huge buddharupa. Parthian nobles such as An Shih Kao are known to have adopted Buddhism and were among those responsible for its further spread towards Han China.\n\nSome knowledge of Buddhism existed quite early in the West. In the 2nd century AD Clement of Alexandria wrote about the Buddha:\n\nHe also recognized Bactrian Buddhists (Sramanas) and Indian Gymnosophists for their influence on Greek thought:\n\nThe story of the birth of the Buddha was also known: a fragment of Archelaos of Carrha (278 AD) mentions the Buddha's virgin-birth, and Saint Jerome (4th century) mentions the birth of the Buddha, who he says \"was born from the side of a virgin\". Queen Maya came to bear the Buddha after receiving a prophetic dream in which she foresaw the descent of the Bodhisattva (Buddha-to-be) from the Tuṣita heaven into her womb. This story has some parallels with the story of Jesus being conceived in connection with the visitation of the Holy Spirit to the Virgin Mary.\n\nEarly 3rd century–4th century Christian writers such as Hippolytus and Epiphanius write about a Scythianus, who visited India around 50 AD from where he brought \"the doctrine of the Two Principles\". According to Cyril of Jerusalem, Scythianus' pupil Terebinthus presented himself as a \"Buddha\" (\"He called himself Buddas\" ). Terebinthus went to Palestine and Judaea (\"becoming known and condemned\"), and ultimately settled in Babylon, where he transmitted his teachings to Mani, thereby creating the foundation of Manichaeism:\n\n\n\n"}

Cross-cultural studies is the third form of cross-cultural comparisons. The first is comparison of case studies, the second is controlled comparison among variants of a common derivation, and the third is comparison within a sample of cases. Unlike comparative studies, which examines similar characteristics of a few societies, cross-cultural studies uses a sufficiently large sample so that statistical analysis can be made to show relationships or lack of relationships between the traits in question. These studies are surveys of ethnographic data.\n\nCross-cultural studies are applied widely in the social sciences, particularly in cultural anthropology and psychology.\n\nThe first cross-cultural studies were carried out by 19th-century anthropologists such as Edward Burnett Tylor and Lewis H. Morgan. One of Edward Tylor's first studies gave rise to the central statistical issue of cross-cultural studies: Galton's problem. In the recent decades historians and particularly historians of science started looking at the mechanism and networks by which knowledge, ideas, skills, instruments and books moved across cultures, generating new and fresh concepts concerning the order of things in nature. In \"Cross-Cultural Scientific Exchanges in the Eastern Mediterranean 1560–1660\" Avner Ben-Zaken has argued that cross-cultural exchanges take place at a cultural hazy locus where the margins of one culture overlaps the other, creating a \"mutually embraced zone\" where exchanges take place on mundane ways. From such a stimulating zone, ideas, styles, instruments and practices move onward to the cultural centers, urging them to renew and update cultural notions.\n\nThe modern era of cross-cultural studies began with George Murdock (1949). Murdock set up a number of foundational data sets, including the Human Relations Area Files, and the \"Ethnographic Atlas.\" Together with Douglas R. White, he developed the widely used Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, currently maintained by the open access electronic journal World Cultures.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39393", "title": "Epicureanism", "text": "Epicureanism\n\nEpicureanism is a system of philosophy based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, founded around 307 BC. Epicurus was an atomic materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His materialism led him to a general attack on superstition and divine intervention. Following Aristippus—about whom very little is known—Epicurus believed that what he called \"pleasure\" (ἡδονή) was the greatest good, but that the way to attain such pleasure was to live modestly, to gain knowledge of the workings of the world, and to limit one's desires. This would lead one to attain a state of tranquility (\"ataraxia\") and freedom from fear as well as an absence of bodily pain (\"aponia\"). The combination of these two states constitutes happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from \"hedonism\" as colloquially understood.\n\nEpicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism, though later it became the main opponent of Stoicism. Epicurus and his followers shunned politics. After the death of Epicurus, his school was headed by Hermarchus; later many Epicurean societies flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era (such as those in Antiochia, Alexandria, Rhodes, and Ercolano). Its best-known Roman proponent was the poet Lucretius. By the end of the Roman Empire, being opposed by philosophies (mainly Neo-Platonism) that were now in the ascendant, Epicureanism had all but died out, and would be resurrected in the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nSome writings by Epicurus have survived. Some scholars consider the epic poem \"On the Nature of Things\" by Lucretius to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism. Many of the scrolls unearthed at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum are Epicurean texts. At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean Philodemus.\n\nIn Mytilene, the capital of the island Lesbos, and then in Lampsacus, Epicurus taught and gained followers. In Athens, Epicurus bought a property for his school called \"Garden\", later the name of Epicurus' school. Its members included Hermarchus, Idomeneus, Colotes, Polyaenus, and Metrodorus. Epicurus emphasized friendship as an important ingredient of happiness, and the school seems to have been a moderately ascetic community which rejected the political limelight of Athenian philosophy. They were fairly cosmopolitan by Athenian standards, including women and slaves. Some members were also vegetarians as, from slender evidence, Epicurus did not eat meat, although no prohibition against eating meat was made.\n\nThe school's popularity grew and it became, along with Stoicism, Platonism, Peripateticism, and Pyrrhonism, one of the dominant schools of Hellenistic philosophy, lasting strongly through the later Roman Empire. Another major source of information is the Roman politician and philosopher Cicero, although he was highly critical, denouncing the Epicureans as unbridled hedonists, devoid of a sense of virtue and duty, and guilty of withdrawing from public life. Another ancient source is Diogenes of Oenoanda, who composed a large inscription at Oenoanda in Lycia. \n\nDeciphered carbonized scrolls obtained from the library at the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum contain a large number of works by Philodemus, a late Hellenistic Epicurean, and Epicurus himself, attesting to the school's enduring popularity. Diogenes reports slanderous stories, circulated by Epicurus' opponents. With growing dominance of Neoplatonism and Peripateticism, and later, Christianity, Epicureanism declined. By the late third century CE, there was little trace of its existence. The early Christian writer Lactantius criticizes Epicurus at several points throughout his \"Divine Institutes\". In Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy\", the Epicureans are depicted as heretics suffering in the sixth circle of hell. In fact, Epicurus appears to represent the ultimate heresy. The word for a heretic in the Talmudic literature is \"Apiqoros\" ().\n\nIn the 17th century, the French Franciscan priest, scientist and philosopher Pierre Gassendi wrote two books forcefully reviving Epicureanism. Shortly thereafter, and clearly influenced by Gassendi, Walter Charleton published several works on Epicureanism in English. Attacks by Christians continued, most forcefully by the Cambridge Platonists.\n\nIn the early modern period, scientists adopted atomist theories, while materialist philosophers embraced Epicurus' hedonist ethics and restated his objections to natural teleology.\n\nEpicureanism does not deny the existence of the gods; rather it denies their involvement in the world. According to Epicureanism, the gods do not interfere with human lives or the rest of the universe in any way. The manner in which the Epicurean gods exist is still disputed. Some scholars say that Epicureanism believes that the gods exist outside the mind as material objects (the realist position), while others assert that the gods only exist in our minds as ideals (the idealist position). The realist position holds that Epicureans understand the gods as existing as physical and immortal beings made of atoms that reside somewhere in reality. However, the gods are completely separate from the rest of reality; they are uninterested in it, play no role in it, and remain completely undisturbed by it. Instead, the gods live in what is called the \"metakosmia\", or the space between worlds. Contrarily, the idealist position holds that Epicurus did not actually conceive of the gods as existing in reality. Rather, Epicurus is said to have viewed the gods as just idealized forms of the best human life, and it is thought that the gods were emblematic of the life one should aspire towards. The debate between these two positions was revived by A. A. Long and David Sedley in their 1987 book, \"The Hellenistic Philosophers\", in which the two argued in favor of the idealist position. While a scholarly consensus has yet to be reached, the realist position remains the prevailing viewpoint at this time.\n\nEpicureanism also offered arguments against the existence of the gods in the manner proposed by other belief systems. The \"Riddle of Epicurus\", or \"Problem of evil\", is a famous argument against the existence of an all-powerful and providential God or gods. As recorded by Lactantius:\n\nThis type of \"trilemma\" argument (God is omnipotent, God is good, but Evil exists) was one favoured by the ancient Greek skeptics, and this argument may have been wrongly attributed to Epicurus by Lactantius, who, from his Christian perspective, regarded Epicurus as an atheist. According to Reinhold F. Glei, it is settled that the argument of theodicy is from an academical source which is not only not Epicurean, but even anti-Epicurean. The earliest extant version of this \"trilemma\" appears in the writings of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus.\n\nParallels may be drawn to Jainism and Buddhism, which similarly emphasize a lack of divine interference and aspects of its atomism. Epicureanism also resembles Buddhism in its temperateness, including the belief that great excess leads to great dissatisfaction.\n\nEpicureanism argued that pleasure was the chief good in life. Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest amount of pleasure possible during one's lifetime, yet doing so moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in such pleasure. Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than on physical pleasures. Unnecessary and, especially, artificially produced desires were to be suppressed. Since the political life could give rise to desires that could disturb virtue and one's peace of mind, such as a lust for power or a desire for fame, participation in politics was discouraged. Further, Epicurus sought to eliminate the fear of the gods and of death, seeing those two fears as chief causes of strife in life. Epicurus actively recommended against passionate love, and believed it best to avoid marriage altogether. He viewed recreational sex as a natural, but not necessary desire that should be generally avoided. \n\nThe Epicurean understanding of justice was inherently self-interested. Justice was deemed good because it was seen as mutually beneficial. Individuals would not act unjustly even if the act was initially unnoticed because of possibly being caught and punished. Both punishment and fear of punishment would cause a person disturbance and prevent them from being happy. \n\nEpicurus laid great emphasis on developing friendships as the basis of a satisfying life.\n\nWhile the pursuit of pleasure formed the focal point of the philosophy, this was largely directed to the \"static pleasures\" of minimizing pain, anxiety and suffering. In fact, Epicurus referred to life as a \"bitter gift\".\n\nEpicureanism rejects immortality. It believes in the soul, but suggests that the soul is mortal and material, just like the body. Epicurus rejected any possibility of an afterlife, while still contending that one need not fear death: \"Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us.\" From this doctrine arose the Epicurean Epitaph: \"Non fui, fui, non sum, non curo\" (\"I was not; I was; I am not; I do not care\"), which is inscribed on the gravestones of his followers and seen on many ancient gravestones of the Roman Empire. This quotation is often used today at humanist funerals.\n\nEpicureanism bases its ethics on a hedonistic set of values. In the most basic sense, Epicureans see pleasure as the purpose of life. As evidence for this, Epicureans say that nature seems to command us to avoid pain, and they point out that all animals try to avoid pain as much as possible. Epicureans had a very specific understanding of what the greatest pleasure was, and the focus of their ethics was on the avoidance of pain rather than seeking out pleasure.\n\nEpicureanism divided pleasure into two broad categories: \"pleasures of the body\" and \"pleasures of the mind\".\nThe Epicureans further divided each of these types of pleasures into two categories: \"kinetic pleasure\" and \"katastematic pleasure\".\nFrom this understanding, Epicureans concluded that the greatest pleasure a person could reach was the complete removal of all pain, both physical and mental. The ultimate goal then of Epicurean ethics was to reach a state of \"aponia\" and \"ataraxia\". In order to do this an Epicurean had to control their desires, because desire itself was seen as painful. Not only will controlling one's desires bring about \"aponia\", as one will rarely suffer from not being physically satisfied, but controlling one's desires will also help to bring about \"ataraxia\" because one will not be anxious about becoming discomforted since one would have so few desires anyway.\n\nEpicurus distinguishes three kinds of desires: the natural and necessary, the natural but not necessary, and those that are neither natural or necessary.\nIf one follows only natural and necessary desires, then, according to Epicurus, one would be able to reach \"aponia\" and \"ataraxia\" and thereby the highest form of happiness.\n\nEpicurus was also an early thinker to develop the notion of justice as a social contract. He defined justice as an agreement made by people not to harm each other. The point of living in a society with laws and punishments is to be protected from harm so that one is free to pursue happiness. Because of this, laws that do not contribute to promoting human happiness are not just. He gave his own unique version of the ethic of reciprocity, which differs from other formulations by emphasizing minimizing harm and maximizing happiness for oneself and others:\"It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly, and it is impossible to live wisely and well and justly without living a pleasant life.\"\n\nEpicureanism incorporated a relatively full account of the social contract theory, and in part attempts to address issues with the society described in Plato's \"Republic\". The social contract theory established by Epicureanism is based on mutual agreement, not divine decree.\n\nEpicurean physics held that the entire universe consisted of two things: matter and void. Matter is made up of atoms, which are tiny bodies that have only the unchanging qualities of shape, size, and weight. Atoms were felt to be unchanging because the Epicureans believed that the world was ordered and that changes had to have specific and consistent sources, e.g. a plant species only grows from a seed of the same species.\n\nEpicurus holds that there must be an infinite supply of atoms, although only a finite number of types of atoms, as well as an infinite amount of void. Epicurus explains this position in his letter to Herodotus:“Moreover, the sum of things is unlimited both by reason of the multitude of the atoms and the extent of the void. For if the void were infinite and bodies finite, the bodies would not have stayed anywhere but would have been dispersed in their course through the infinite void, not having any supports or counterchecks to send them back on their upward rebound. Again, if the void were finite, the infinity of bodies would not have anywhere to be.\"Because of the infinite supply of atoms, there are an infinite amount of worlds, or \"cosmoi\". Some of these worlds could be vastly different than our own, some quite similar, and all of the worlds were separated from each other by vast areas of void (\"metakosmia\").\n\nEpicureanism states that atoms are unable to be broken down into any smaller parts, and Epicureans offered multiple arguments to support this position. Epicureans argue that because void is necessary for matter to move, anything which consists of both void and matter can be broken down, while if something contains no void then it has no way to break apart because no part of the substance could be broken down into a smaller subsection of the substance. They also argued that in order for the universe to persist, what it is ultimately made up of must not be able to be changed or else the universe would be essentially destroyed.\n\nAtoms are constantly moving in one of four different ways. Atoms can simply collide with each other and then bounce off of each other. When joined with each other and forming a larger object, atoms can vibrate as they into each other while still maintaining the overall shape of the larger object. When not prevented by other atoms, all atoms move at the same speed naturally downwards in relation to the rest world. This downwards motion is natural for atoms; however, as their fourth means of motion, atoms can at times randomly swerve out of their usual downwards path. This swerving motion is what allowed for the creation of the universe, since as more and more atoms swerved and collided with each other, objects were able to take shape as the atoms joined together. Without the swerve, the atoms would never have interacted with each other, and simply continued to move downwards at the same speed.\n\nEpicurus also felt that the swerve was what accounted for humanity's free will. If it were not for the swerve, humans would be subject to a never-ending chain of cause and effect. This was a point which Epicureans often used to criticize Democritus' atomic theory.\n\nEpicureans believed that senses also relied on atoms. Every object was continually emitting particles from itself that would then interact with the observer. All sensations, such as sight, smell, or sound, relied on these particles. While the atoms that were emitted did not have the qualities that the senses were perceiving, the manner in which they were emitted caused the observer to experience those sensations, e.g. red particles were not themselves red but were emitted in a manner that caused the viewer to experience the color red. The atoms are not perceived individually, but rather as a continuous sensation because of how quickly they move.\n\nEpicurean philosophy employs an empirical epistemology. The Epicureans believed that all sense perceptions were true, and that errors arise in how we judge those perceptions. When we form judgments about things (\"hupolepsis\"), they can be verified and corrected through further sensory information. For example, if someone sees a tower from far away that appears to be round, and upon approaching the tower they see that it is actually square, they would come to realize that their original judgement was wrong and correct their wrong opinion.\n\nEpicurus is said to have proposed three criteria of truth: sensations (\"aisthêsis\"), preconceptions (\"prolepsis\"), and feelings (\"pathê\"). A fourth criterion called \"presentational applications of the mind\" (\"phantastikai epibolai tês dianoias\") was said to have been added by later Epicureans. These criteria formed the method through which Epicureans thought we gained knowledge.\n\nSince Epicureans thought that sensations could not deceive, sensations are the first and main criterion of truth for Epicureans. Even in cases where sensory input seems to mislead, the input itself is true and the error arises from our judgments about the input. For example, when one places a straight oar in the water, it appears bent. The Epicurean would argue that image of the oar, that is the atoms traveling from the oar to the observer's eyes, have been shifted and thus really do arrive at the observer's eyes in the shape of a bent oar. The observer makes the error in assuming that the image he or she receives correctly represents the oar and has not been distorted in some way. In order to not make erroneous judgments about perceivable things and instead verify one's judgment, Epicureans believed that one needed to obtain \"clear vision\" (\"enargeia\") of the perceivable thing by closer examination. This acted as a justification for one's judgements about the thing being perceived. \"Enargeia\" is characterized as sensation of an object that has been unchanged by judgments or opinions and is a clear and direct perception of that object.\n\nAn individual's preconceptions are his or her concepts of what things are, e.g. what someone's idea of a horse is, and these concepts are formed in a person's mind through sensory input over time. When the word that relates to the preconception is used, these preconceptions are summoned up by the mind into the person's thoughts. It is through our preconceptions that we are able to make judgments about the things that we perceive. Preconceptions were also used by Epicureans to avoid the paradox proposed by Plato in the \"Meno\" regarding learning. Plato argues that learning requires us to already have knowledge of what we are learning, or else we would be unable to recognize when we had successfully learned the information. Preconceptions, Epicureans argue, provide individuals with that pre-knowledge required for learning.\n\nOur feelings or emotions (\"pathê\") are how we perceive pleasure and pain. They are analogous to sensations in that they are a means of perception, but they perceive our internal state as opposed to external things. According to Diogenes Laertius, feelings are how we determine our actions. If something is pleasurable, we pursue that thing, and if something is painful, we avoid that thing.\n\nThe idea of \"presentational applications of the mind\" is an explanation for how we can discuss and inquire about things we cannot directly perceive. We receive impressions of such things directly in our minds, instead of perceiving them through other senses. The concept of \"presentational applications of the mind\" may have been introduced to explain how we learn about things that we cannot directly perceive, such as the gods.\n\nTetrapharmakos, or \"The four-part cure\", is Epicurus' basic guideline as to how to live the happiest possible life. This poetic doctrine was handed down by an anonymous Epicurean who summed up Epicurus' philosophy on happiness in four simple lines:\n\nOne of the earliest Roman writers espousing Epicureanism was Amafinius. Other adherents to the teachings of Epicurus included the poet Horace, whose famous statement \"Carpe Diem\" (\"Seize the Day\") illustrates the philosophy, as well as Lucretius, who wrote the poem \"De rerum natura\" about the tenets of the philosophy. The poet Virgil was another prominent Epicurean (see Lucretius for further details). The Epicurean philosopher Philodemus of Gadara, until the 18th century only known as a poet of minor importance, rose to prominence as most of his work along with other Epicurean material was discovered in the Villa of the Papyri. In the second century CE, comedian Lucian of Samosata and wealthy promoter of philosophy Diogenes of Oenoanda were prominent Epicureans.\n\nJulius Caesar leaned considerably toward Epicureanism, which e.g. led to his plea against the death sentence during the trial against Catiline, during the Catiline conspiracy where he spoke out against the Stoic Cato.\n\nIn modern times Thomas Jefferson referred to himself as an Epicurean:If I had time I would add to my little book the Greek, Latin and French texts, in columns side by side. And I wish I could subjoin a translation of Gassendi's Syntagma of the doctrines of Epicurus, which, notwithstanding the calumnies of the Stoics and caricatures of Cicero, is the most rational system remaining of the philosophy of the ancients, as frugal of vicious indulgence, and fruitful of virtue as the hyperbolical extravagances of his rival sects.Other modern-day Epicureans were Gassendi, Walter Charleton, François Bernier, Saint-Evremond, Ninon de l'Enclos, Denis Diderot, Frances Wright and Jeremy Bentham. \n\nChristopher Hitchens referred to himself as an Epicurean. In France, where perfumer/restaurateur Gérald Ghislain refers to himself as an Epicurean, Michel Onfray is developing a post-modern approach to Epicureanism. In his recent book titled \"The Swerve\", Stephen Greenblatt identified himself as strongly sympathetic to Epicureanism and Lucretius. Humanistic Judaism as a denomination also claims the Epicurean label.\n\nIn modern popular usage, an Epicurean is a connoisseur of the arts of life and the refinements of sensual pleasures; \"Epicureanism\" implies a love or knowledgeable enjoyment especially of good food and drink.\n\nBecause Epicureanism posits that pleasure is the ultimate good (\"telos\"), it has been commonly misunderstood since ancient times as a doctrine that advocates the partaking in fleeting pleasures such as sexual excess and decadent food. This is not the case. Epicurus regarded \"ataraxia\" (tranquility, freedom from fear) and \"aponia\" (absence of pain) as the height of happiness. He also considered prudence an important virtue and perceived excess and overindulgence to be contrary to the attainment of ataraxia and aponia.\n\nInstead, Epicurus preferred \"the good\", and \"even wisdom and culture\" to the \"pleasure of the stomach\". While some twentieth-century commentary has sought to diminish this and related quotations, the consistency with Epicurean philosophy overall has more recently been explained.\n\nWhen Epicurus sought moderation at meals, he was also not averse to moderation in moderation, that is, to occasional luxury. His community also became known for its feasts of the twentieth (of the Greek month).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1751119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1751119", "title": "Final good", "text": "Final good\n\nA consumer good or final good is any commodity that is produced or consumed by the consumer to satisfy current wants or needs. Consumer goods are ultimately consumed, rather than used in the production of another good. For example, a microwave oven or a bicycle that is sold to a consumer is a final good or consumer good, but the components that are sold to be used in those goods are intermediate goods. For example, textiles or transistors can be used to make some further goods.\n\nWhen used in measures of national income and output, the term \"final goods\" includes only new goods. For instance, the GDP excludes items counted in an earlier year to prevent double counting of production that is based on resales of the same item. In that context, the economic definition of goods includes what are commonly known as \"services\".\n\"Manufactured goods\" are goods that have been processed in any way. As such, they are the opposite of raw materials, but they include intermediate goods as well as final goods.\n\nThere are legal definitions. For example, the United States Consumer Product Safety Act has an extensive definition of consumer product, which begins:\nCONSUMER PRODUCT.--The term ‘‘consumer product’’ means any article, or component part thereof, produced or distributed (i) for sale to a consumer for use in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise, or (ii) for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of a consumer in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise; but such term does not include—\n(A) any article which is not customarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption by, or enjoyment of, a consumer,\nIt then goes on to list eight additional specific exclusions and further details.\n\nFinal goods can be classified into the following categories:\n\nConsumer durable goods usually have a significant lifespan, which tends to be at least one year, based on the guarantee or warranty period. The maximum life depends upon the durability of the product or good. On the other hand, capital goods, which are tangible in nature, such as machinery or building or any other equipment that can be used in manufacturing of final product, are durable goods with limited lifespans that are determined by manufacturers before their sale. The longevity and the often-higher cost of durable goods usually cause consumers to postpone expenditures on them, which makes durables the most volatile (or cost-dependent) component of consumption.\n\nConsumer nondurable goods are purchased for immediate use or for use very soon. Generally, the lifespan of nondurable goods is from a few minutes to up to three years: food, beverages, clothing, shoes and gasoline are examples.\n\nConsumer services are the intangible in nature. They cannot be seen, felt or tasted by the consumer but still give satisfaction to the consumer. They are also inseparable and variable in nature: they are thus produced and consumed simultaneously. Examples are haircuts, auto repairs and landscaping.\n\nFinal goods can be classified into the following categories, which are determined by the consumer's buying habits:\n\nConvenience goods are regularly consumed and easily available. Generally, convenience goods come in the category of nondurable goods such as fast foods, cigarettes and tobacco with low value. Convenience goods are sold mostly by wholesalers or retailers to make them available to the consumers in good or large volume. Convenience goods can further be divided into staple convenience consumer goods and impulse convenience consumer goods.\n\nStaple convenience consumer goods are the basic necessities of the consumer. These goods are easily available and in large quantity: milk, bread, sugar, etc.\n\nImpulse convenience consumer goods do not belong to the priority list of the consumer. They are purchased without any prior planning, just on the basis of the impulse: potato wafers, candies, ice creams, cold drinks, etc.\n\nShopping consumer goods are the goods which take lot of time and proper planning before making purchase decision; in this case consumer does a lot of selection and comparison based on various parameters such as cost, brand, style, comfort etc., before buying an item. Shopping goods are costlier than convenience goods and are durable in nature. Consumer goods companies usually try to set up their shops and show rooms in active shopping area to attract customer attention and their main focus is to do lots of advertising and promotion so that to attract more customer.\n\nExamples include clothing items, televisions, radios, footwear, home furnishings, etc.\n\nSpecialty goods are unique in nature; these are unusual and luxurious items available in the market. Specialty goods are mostly purchased by the upper class of the society as they are expensive in nature and difficult to be afforded by middle or lower-class people. Companies advertise their goods targeting the upper class. These goods do not fall under the category of necessity; rather they are purchased on the basis personal preference or desire. Brand name, uniqueness, and special features of an item are major attributes which attract customers and make them buy such products.\n\nExamples include antiques, jewelry, wedding dresses, cars, etc.\n\nUnsought goods neither belong to the necessity group of consumer goods list nor to specialty goods. They are always available in the market but are purchased by very few consumers, either based on their interest or their need for some specific reasons. The general public does not purchase such goods often.\n\nExamples include snowshoes, fire extinguishers, flood insurance, etc.\n\nIn the consumer product sector, there have been 107,891 deals announced between 1985 and 2018, which cumulates to a total value of around US$5,835 billion. 2007 was the year with the largest value (US$4,888 billion) followed by a steep slump in 2009 (-70.9%). After the first wave in 2007, now is the second big M&A wave in the consumer products sector, and a decline is expected.\n\n"}

{"id": "21920776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21920776", "title": "Folk religion", "text": "Folk religion\n\nIn religious studies and folkloristics, folk religion, popular religion, or vernacular religion comprises various forms and expressions of religion that are distinct from the official doctrines and practices of organized religion. The precise definition of folk religion varies among scholars. Sometimes also termed popular belief, it consists of ethnic or regional religious customs under the umbrella of a religion, but outside official doctrine and practices.\n\nThe term \"folk religion\" is generally held to encompass two related but separate subjects. The first is the religious dimension of folk culture, or the folk-cultural dimensions of religion. The second refers to the study of syncretisms between two cultures with different stages of formal expression, such as the melange of African folk beliefs and Roman Catholicism that led to the development of Vodun and Santería, and similar mixtures of formal religions with folk cultures.\n\nChinese folk religion, folk Christianity, folk Hinduism, and folk Islam are examples of folk religion associated with major religions. The term is also used, especially by the clergy of the faiths involved, to describe the desire of people who otherwise infrequently attend religious worship, do not belong to a church or similar religious society, and who have not made a formal profession of faith in a particular creed, to have religious weddings or funerals, or (among Christians) to have their children baptised.\n\nIn \"The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions\", John Bowker characterized \"folk religion\" as either \"religion which occurs in small, local communities which does not adhere to the norms of large systems\" or \"the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level.\"\n\nDon Yoder argued that there were five separate ways of defining folk religion. The first was a perspective rooted in a cultural evolutionary framework which understood folk religion as representing the survivals of older forms of religion; in this, it would constitute \"the survivals, in an official religious context, of beliefs and behavior inherited from earlier stages of the culture's development\". This definition would view folk religion in Catholic Europe as the survivals of pre-Christian religion and the folk religion in Protestant Europe as the survivals of Medieval Catholicism. The second definition identified by Yoder was the view that folk religion represented the mixture of an official religion with forms of ethnic religion; this was employed to explain the place of folk religion in the syncretic belief systems of the Americas, where Christianity had blended with the religions of indigenous American and African communities.\n\nYoder's third definition was that often employed within folkloristics, which held that folk religion was \"the interaction of belief, ritual, custom, and mythology in traditional societies\", representing that which was often pejoratively characterised as superstition. The fourth definition provided by Yoder stated that folk religion represented the \"folk interpretation and expression of religion\". Noting that this definition would not encompass beliefs that were largely unconnected from organised religion, such as in witchcraft, he therefore altered this definition by including the concept of \"folk religiosity\", thereby defining folk religion as \"the deposit in culture of folk religiosity, the full range of folk attitudes to religion\". His fifth and final definition represented a \"practical working definition\" that combined elements from these various other definitions. Thus, he summarized folk religion as \"the totality of all those views and practices of religion that exist among the people apart from and alongside the strictly theological and liturgical forms of the official religion\".\n\nYoder described \"folk religion\" as existing \"in a complex society in relation to and in tension with the organized religion(s) of that society. Its relatively unorganized character differentiates it from organized religion\".\n\nAlternately, the sociologist of religion Matthias Zic Varul defined \"folk religion\" as \"the relatively un-reflected aspect of ordinary practices and beliefs that are oriented towards, or productive of, something beyond the immediate here-and-now: everyday transcendence\".\n\nIn Europe the study of \"folk religion\" emerged from the study of \"religiöse Volkskund\", a German term which was used in reference to \"the religious dimension of folk-culture, or the folk-cultural dimension of religion\". This term was first employed by a German Lutheran preacher, Paul Drews, in a 1901 article that he published which was titled \"Religiöse Volkskunde, eine Aufgabe der praktischen Theologie\". This article was designed to be read by young Lutheran preachers leaving the seminary, to equip them for the popular variants of Lutheranism that they would encounter among their congregations and which would differ from the official, doctrinal Lutheranism that they had been accustomed to. Although developing within a religious environment, the term came to be adopted by German academics in the field of folkloristics. During the 1920s and 1930s, theoretical studies of \"religiöse Volkskund\" had been produced by the folklorists Josef Weigert, Werner Boette, and Max Rumpf, all of whom had focused on religiosity within German peasant communities. Over the coming decades, Georg Schreiber established an Institut für religiöse Volkskund in Munich while a similar department was established in Salzburg by Hanns Koren. Other prominent academics involved in the study of the phenomenon were Heinrich Schauert and Rudolf Kriss, the latter of whom collected one of the largest collections of folk-religious art and material culture in Europe, later housed in Munich's Bayerisches Nationalmuseum. Throughout the 20th century, many studies were made of folk religion in Europe, paying particular attention to such subjects as pilgrimage and the use of shrines.\n\nIn the Americas, the study of folk religion developed among cultural anthropologists studying the syncretistic cultures of the Caribbean and Latin America. The pioneer in this field was Redfield, whose 1930 book \"Tepoztlán: A Mexican Village\" contrasted and examined the relationship between \"folk religion\" and \"official religion\" in a peasant community. Yoder later noted that although the earliest known usage of the term \"folk religion\" in the English language was unknown, it probably developed as a translation of the German \"Volksreligion\". One of the earliest prominent usages of the term was in the title of Joshua Trachtenberg's 1939 work \"Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion\". The term also gained increasing usage within the academic field of comparative religion, appearing in the titles of Ichiro Hori's \"Folk Religion in Japan\", Martin Nilsson's \"Greek Folk Religion\", and Charles Leslie's reader, the \"Anthropology of Folk Religion\". Courses on the study of folk religion came to be taught at various universities in the United States, such as John Messenger's at Indiana University and Don Yoder's at the University of Pennsylvania.\nAlthough the subject of folk religion fell within the remit of scholars operating in both folkloristics and religious studies, by 1974 Yoder noted that U.S.-based academics in the latter continued to largely ignore it, instead focusing on the study of theology and institutionalised religion; he contrasted this with the situation in Europe, where historians of religion had devoted much time to studying folk religiosity. He also lamented that many U.S.-based folklorists also neglected the subject of religion because it did not fit within the standard genre-based system for cataloguing folklore.\n\nThe term \"folk religion\" came to be increasingly rejected in the 1990s and 2000s by scholars seeking more precise terminology.\n\nYoder noted that one problem with the use of the term \"folk religion\" was that it did not fit into the work of those scholars who used the term \"religion\" in reference solely to organized religion. He highlighted the example of the prominent sociologist of religion Émile Durkheim, who insisted that \"religion\" was organized in order to contrast it with \"magic\". Yoder noted that scholars adopting these perspectives often preferred the term \"folk belief\" over \"folk religion\".\n\nA second problem with the use of \"folk religion\" that Yoder highlighted was that some scholars, particularly those operating in the sociology of religion, used the term as a synonym for ethnic religion (which is alternately known as national religion or tribal religion), meaning a religion closely tied to a particular ethnic or national group and is thus contrasted with a \"universal religion\" which cuts across ethnic and national boundaries. Among the scholars to have adopted this use of terminology are E. Wilbur Bock.\n\nThe folklorist Leonard Norman Primiano argued that the use of \"folk religion\", as well as related terms like \"popular religion\" and \"unofficial religion\", by scholars, does \"an extreme disservice\" to the forms of religiosity that scholarship is examining, because – in his opinion – such terms are \"residualistic, [and] derogatory\". He argued that using such terminology implies that there is \"a pure element\" to religion \"which is in some way transformed, even contaminated, by its exposure to human communities\". As a corrective, he suggested that scholars use \"vernacular religion\" as an alternative. Defining this term, Primiano stated that \"vernacular religion\" is, \"by definition, religion as it is lived: as human beings encounter, understand, interpret, and practice it. Since religion inherently involves interpretation, it is impossible for the religion of an individual not to be vernacular\".\n\nKapaló was critical of this approach, deeming it \"mistaken\" and arguing that switching from \"folk religion\" to \"vernacular religion\" results in the scholar \"picking up a different selection of things from the world\". He cautioned that both terms were \"ideological and semantic load[ed]\" and warned scholars to pay attention to the associations that each word had.\n\nChinese folk religion or Shenism are labels used to describe the collection of ethnic religious traditions which have historically comprised the predominant belief system in China and among Han Chinese ethnic groups up to the present day. Shenism describes Chinese mythology and includes the worship of \"shen\" (spirit, god, awareness, consciousness) which can be nature deities, Taizu or clan deities, city gods, national deities, culture heroes and demigods, dragons and ancestors. \"Shenism\" as a term was first published by AJA Elliot in 1955.\n\nChinese folk religion is sometimes categorized with Taoism, since over the centuries institutional Taoism has been attempting to assimilate or administrate local religions. More accurately, Taoism can be defined as a branch of Shenism, since it sprang out of folk religion and Chinese philosophy. Chinese folk religion is sometimes seen as a constituent part of Chinese traditional religion, but more often, the two are regarded as synonymous. With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population, Chinese folk religion is one of the major religious traditions in the world. In China more than 30% of the population adheres to Shenism or Taoism.\n\nDespite being heavily suppressed during the last two centuries, from the Taiping Rebellion to the Cultural Revolution, it is currently experiencing a modern revival in both Mainland China and Taiwan. Various forms have received support by the Government of the People's Republic of China, such as Mazuism in Southern China (officially about 160 million Chinese are Mazuists), Huangdi worship, Black Dragon worship in Shaanxi, and Cai Shen worship.\n\nFolk Christianity is defined differently by various scholars. Definitions include \"the Christianity practiced by a conquered people\", Christianity as most people live it – a term used to \"overcome the division of beliefs into Orthodox and unorthodox\", Christianity as impacted by superstition as practiced by certain geographical Christian groups, and Christianity defined \"in cultural terms without reference to the theologies and histories.\"\n\nFolk Islam is an umbrella term used to collectively describe forms of Islam that incorporate native folk beliefs and practices. Folk Islam has been described as the Islam of the \"urban poor, country people, and tribes\", in contrast to orthodox or \"High\" Islam (Gellner, 1992) Sufism and Sufi concepts are often integrated into Folk Islam.\n\nVarious practices and beliefs have been identified with the concept of \"folk Islam\". They include the following:\n\nIn one of the first major academic works on the subject, titled \"Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion\", Joshua Trachtenberg provided a definition of Jewish folk religion as consisting of ideas and practices that whilst not meeting with the approval of religious leaders enjoyed wide popularity such that they must be included in what he termed the field of religion. This included unorthodox beliefs about demons and angels, and magical practices.\n\nLater studies have emphasized the significance of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem to the many Jewish folk customs linked to mourning and in particular to the belief in \"hibbut ha-qever\" (torture of the grave) a belief that the dead are tortured in their grave for three days after burial by demons until they remember their names. This idea began with early eschatalogical aggadah and was then further developed by the kabbalists.\nRaphael Patai has been acknowledged as one of the first to utilize anthropology to study Jewish folk religion. In particular he has drawn attention to the important role of the female divine element, which he sees in the goddess Asherah, the Shekhinah, the Matronit, and Lilith.\nWriter Stephen Sharot has stated that Jewish popular religion in common with other forms of folk religion, has a focus on the apotropaic, or thaumaturgical, i.e. it is used to assist in protecting the individual from sickness, and misfortune. He emphasizes that while Rabbinical Judaism dealt with orthodox Jewish ritual, and halakah, magicians claimed to use unorthodox magical rituals to help people in everyday life. He points to the example of a relatively professionalised type of magician being the ba'al shem of Poland, who beginning in the 16th century thrived with the popularity of practical kabbalah in the 18th century. These ba'al shem promised to use their knowledge of the names of god, and the angels, along with exorcism, chiromancy, and herbal medicine to bring harm to enemies, and success in areas of social life such as marriage, and childbirth.\n\nCharles Liebman has written that the essence of the folk religion of American Jews is their social ties to one another, illustrated by the finding that religious practices that would prevent social integration -such as a strict interpretation of dietary laws and the Sabbath- have been abandoned, whilst the practices that are followed -such as the Passover seder, social rites of passage, and the High Holy Days- are ones that strengthen Jewish family and community integration. Liebman described the rituals and beliefs of contemporary Jewish folk religion in his works, \"The Ambivalent American Jew\" (1973) and \"American Jewry: Identity and Affiliation\".\n\nIn sociology, folk religion is often contrasted with elite religion. Folk religion is defined as the beliefs, practices, rituals and symbols originating from sources other than the religion's leadership. Folk religion in many instances is tolerated by the religion's leadership, although they may consider it an error. A similar concept is lived religion, the study of religion as practiced by believers.\n\n\n"}

Ghost bikes are usually junk bicycles painted white, sometimes with a placard attached, and locked to a suitable object close to the scene of the accident. They are also sometimes stripped of their tires, to deter theft.\n\nA ghost bike may also refer to a bike without a rider. By jumping off while the bicycle is in motion, it will continue to roll until falling over or hitting an object that stops it. This is the original ghost bike. \n__notoc__\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", the first recorded ghost bike was in St. Louis, Missouri, in 2003. A witness to a collision between a cyclist and a car placed a painted bike at the location with a message that read: \"Cyclist struck here.\n\nThe original idea of painting bikes white reportedly goes back to the city of Amsterdam in the 1960s as an anarchist project to liberate two-wheel transport—white bikes were free, help yourself and then leave it for someone else.\n\nThe ghost bike idea in the United States may have originated with a project by San Francisco artist Jo Slota, begun in April 2002. This was a purely artistic endeavor. Slota was intrigued by the abandoned bicycles that he found around the city, locked up but stripped of useful parts. He began painting them white, and posted photographs on his website, ghostbike.net. As the idea was taken up for different purposes, Slota faced a dilemma. San Francisco is one of the safer U.S. cities for bicyclists, but memorial ghost bikes sprang up there as elsewhere, changing perceptions of his project.\n\nA ghost bike memorial project was started in St. Louis in October 2003. After observing a motorist strike a bicyclist in a bike lane on Holly Hills Boulevard, Patrick Van Der Tuin placed a white-painted bicycle on the spot with a hand-painted sign reading \"Cyclist Struck Here\". Noticing the effect that this had on motorists in the area, Van Der Tuin then enlisted the help of friends to place 15 more \"ghost bikes\" in prominent spots in the St. Louis area where cyclists had recently been hit by automobiles. They used damaged bikes, in some cases deliberately damaged to create the desired mangled effect.\n\nSimilar projects began in Pittsburgh in 2004, New York City, Seattle in 2005, Albuquerque, and Toronto in 2006. In August 2005, nearly 40 ghost bikes were placed throughout Seattle to draw awareness to locations of accidents, near-misses, and poor road conditions. A ghost bike in Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C., commemorating a rider killed by a garbage truck in 2008, remained for a full year. When it was removed by city employees, friends of the rider replaced it with 22 ghost bikes, one on every lamppost. London Ghostcycle was active in 2005 and 2006. There have been similar projects in dozens of other cities worldwide. A bike memorial project was recently started Durham, North Carolina to commemorate the death of two prominent cyclist and bicycle safety advocates.\n\nIn late 2013 and early 2014, the Houston Ghost Bike Group has placed 47 ghost bikes to raise awareness during an especially deadly string of cycling accidents involving automobiles taking place in Houston, many of them hit and run. As of this posting, they are working on 13 more bikes to bring the list of deaths in recent years up to date.\n\nThere are currently over 630 ghost bikes that have since appeared in over 210 locations throughout the world. No single entity governs the installation of all ghost bikes, and they are sometimes removed by those who dislike the practice.\n\n\n"}

The word roughly translates to the \"thing that you live for\" but it also has the nuance of \"the reason for which you wake up in the morning\" similar to a daily purpose. Each individual's ikigai is personal to them and specific to their lives, values and beliefs. It reflects the inner self of an individual and expresses that faithfully, while simultaneously creating a mental state in which the individual feels at ease. Activities that allow one to feel ikigai are never forced on an individual; they are often spontaneous, and always undertaken willingly, giving the individual satisfaction and a sense of meaning to life.\n\nThe term \"ikigai\" compounds two Japanese words: meaning \"life; alive\" and \"kai\" (甲斐) meaning \"(an) effect; (a) result; (a) fruit; (a) worth; (a) use; (a) benefit; (no, little) avail\" (sequentially voiced as \"gai\") to arrive at \"a reason for living [being alive]; a meaning for [to] life; what [something that] makes life worth living; a raison d'etre\".\n\nIn the culture of Okinawa, \"ikigai\" is thought of as \"a reason to get up in the morning\"; that is, a reason to enjoy life. In a TED Talk, Dan Buettner suggested \"ikigai\" as one of the reasons people in the area had such long lives.\n\nThe word \"ikigai\" usually is used to indicate the source of value in one's life or the things that make one's life worthwhile. Secondly, the word is used to refer to mental and spiritual circumstances under which individuals feel that their lives are valuable. It's not linked to one's financial status. Even if a person feels that the present is dark, but they have a goal in mind, they may feel \"ikigai\". Behaviours that make one feel \"ikigai\" are not actions one is forced to take—these are natural and spontaneous actions.\n\nIn the article titled (\"Ikigai: the process of allowing the self's possibilities to blossom\") Kobayashi Tsukasa says that \"people can feel real ikigai only when, on the basis of personal maturity, the satisfaction of various desires, love and happiness, encounters with others, and a sense of the value of life, they proceed toward self-realization.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "225153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225153", "title": "Juche", "text": "Juche\n\nJuche (; ; ; usually left untranslated or translated as \"self-reliance\") is the official state ideology of North Korea, described by the government as \"Kim Il-sung's original, brilliant and revolutionary contribution to national and international thought\". It postulates that \"man is the master of his destiny\", that the Korean masses are to act as the \"masters of the revolution and construction\" and that by becoming self-reliant and strong a nation can achieve true socialism.\n\nKim Il-sung (1912–1994) developed the ideology, originally viewed as a variant of Marxism–Leninism until it became distinctly Korean in character whilst incorporating the historical materialist ideas of Marxism–Leninism and strongly emphasizing the individual, the nation state and its sovereignty. Consequently, the North Korean government adopted \"Juche\" into a set of principles it uses to justify its policy decisions from the 1950s onwards. Such principles include moving the nation towards claimed \"jaju\" (\"independence\"), through the construction of \"jarip\" (\"national economy\") and an emphasis upon \"jawi\" (\"self-defence\") in order to establish socialism.\n\nThe practice of \"Juche\" is firmly rooted in the ideals of sustainability through agricultural independence and a lack of dependency. The \"Juche\" ideology has been criticized by many scholars and observers as a mechanism for sustaining the totalitarian rule of the North Korean regime and justifying the country's heavy-handed isolationism and oppression of the North Korean people. It has also been described as a form of Korean ethnic nationalism, but one that promotes the Kim family as the saviours of the \"Korean race\" and acts as a foundation of the subsequent personality cult surrounding them.\n\n\"Juche\" comes from a Sino-Japanese word whose Japanese reading is \"shutai\". The word was coined in 1887 to translate the concept of \"\" in German philosophy (subject, meaning \"the entity perceiving or acting upon an object or environment\") into Japanese. The word migrated to the Korean language at around the turn of the century and retained this meaning. \"Shutai\" went on to appear in Japanese translations of Karl Marx's writings. North Korean editions of Marx used the word \"Juche\" even before the word was attributed to Kim Il-sung in its supposedly novel meaning in 1955.\n\nIn today's political discourse on North Korea, \"Juche\" has a connotation of \"self-reliance\", \"autonomy\" and \"independence\". It is often defined in opposition to the Korean concept of \"Sadae\", or reliance on the great powers. South Koreans use the word without reference to the North Korean ideology.\n\nOfficial statements by the North Korean government attribute the origin of \"Juche\" to Kim Il-sung's experiences in the Anti-Imperialist Youth League in 1930 in his \"liberation struggle\" against Japan. The first documented reference to \"Juche\" as an ideology appeared in 1955 in a speech given by Kim Il-sung entitled \"On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing \"Juche\" in Ideological Work\". The speech had been delivered to promote a political purge similar to the earlier Yan'an Rectification Movement in China.\n\nHwang Jang-yop, Kim's top adviser on ideology, discovered Kim's 1955 speech in the late 1950s when Kim, having established a cult of personality, sought to develop his own version of Marxism–Leninism into a North Korean ideology.\n\nIn his 1955 speech, the first known to refer to \"Juche\", Kim Il-sung said: To make revolution in Korea we must know Korean history and geography as well as the customs of the Korean people. Only then is it possible to educate our people in a way that suits them and to inspire in them an ardent love for their native place and their motherland.\n\nIn the speech \"On Socialist Construction and the South Korean Revolution in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" given on 14 April 1965, Kim Il-sung outlined the three fundamental principles of \"Juche\":\n\n\"On the Juche Idea\", the main work on \"Juche\", was published in North Korea in Kim Jong-il's name in 1982. In North Korea it functions as \"the authoritative and comprehensive explanation of \"Juche\"\". According to the treatise, the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) is responsible for indoctrinating the masses in the ways of \"Juche\" thinking. According to the treatise, \"Juche\" is inexorably linked with Kim Il-sung and it \"represents the guiding idea of the Korean Revolution [...] we are confronted with the honorable task of modeling the whole society on the \"Juche\" idea\". Kim Jong-il states in the work that \"Juche\" is not a creative application of Marxism–Leninism, but rather \"a new era in the development of human history\" while criticizing the \"communists and nationalists\" of the 1920s for their elitist posture, claiming that they were \"divorced from the masses\". The WPK's break with basic premises of Marxism–Leninism emerges more clearly in the article \"Let Us March Under the Banner of Marxism–Leninism and the \"Juche\" Idea\".\n\nIn August 1997, the Central People's Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea promulgated regulations regarding use of the \"Juche\" Era calendar. Gregorian calendar dates are used for years before 1912 while years from 1912 (the year of Kim Il-sung's birth) are described as \"\"Juche\" years\". The Gregorian year 2018, for example, is \"\"Juche\" 107\" as 2018-1911=107. When used, \"\"Juche\" years\" are often accompanied by the Gregorian equivalent, i.e. \"\"Juche\" 107, 2018\" or \"\"Juche\" 107 (2018)\".\n\nKim's regime saw Juche principles as applicable around the world, not just in Korea. Since 1976 North Korea has organized international seminars on \"Juche\". The International Scientific Seminar on the \"Juche\" Idea took place in Antananarivo from 28 September to 30 September 1976 under the sponsorship of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar. Many prominent party and government officials, public figures, representatives of revolutionary and progressive organizations, scientists and journalists from more than fifty countries attended. Malagasy President Didier Ratsiraka expressed strong sympathies and support for North Korea. An excerpt from the opening speech says:Regardless of the opposition forces, the determination of the people and their strength and conviction are not measured by territorial dimensions, possession of advanced technology, still less, opulence or riches. For those who wish to forget the lesson of history so easily and so quickly, Algeria, Viet Nam, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola – and closer to us – Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Azania are excellent examples which make them deeply reflect on. What we want is not the perfection of political independence alone. The evil forces craftily manipulate the economic levers in order to perpetuate their supremacy and reduce us to vassals and eternal mendicants.\n\nThe International Institute of the \"Juche\" Idea was established in Tokyo in 1978 to supervise international \"Juche\" research-groups. The \"Juche\" Tower in Pyongyang, completed in 1982, incorporated commemorative plaques from supporters and \"Juche\" Study Groups from around the world. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Black Panther Party of the United States expressed sympathy for the Juche ideology. In 2016, the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party identified \"Juche\" as the guiding idea in its governance of the city of Bhaktapur.\n\nKimilsungism was first mentioned by Kim Jong-il in the 1970s and was introduced alongside the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System. Not long after the term's introduction into the North Korean lexicon, Kim Jong-il allegedly launched a \" of the Whole Society\" campaign. These campaigns were introduced so as to strengthen Kim Jong-il's position within the Workers' Party of Korea. According to political analyst Lim Jae-cheon, \"\"Kimilsungism\" refers to the thoughts of Kim Il-sung. It is interchangeable with the idea\". However, in his 1976 speech \"On Correctly Understanding the Originality of Kimilsungism\" he said that Kimilsungism comprises the \"\"Juche\" idea and a far-reaching revolutionary theory and leadership method evolved from this idea\". In the past Kim Il-sung's thoughts had been described by the official media as \"contemporary Marxism–Leninism\", but by calling it Kimilsungism Kim Jong-il was trying to elevate it to the same level as Maoism, Hoxhaism and Stalinism. The younger Kim further argued that Kim Il-sung's thoughts had evolved and they therefore deserved their own distinct name. He further added that \"Kimilsungism is an original idea that cannot be explained within the frameworks of Marxism–Leninism. The idea of \"Juche\", which constitutes the quintessence of Kimilsungism, is an idea newly discovered in the history of mankind\". Kim Jong-il went further, stating that Marxism–Leninism had become obsolete and must be replaced by Kimilsungism: \n\nAccording to analyst Shin Gi-wook, the ideas of \"Juche\" and Kimilsungism were in essence the \"expressions of North Korean particularism over supposedly more universalistic Marxism–Leninism\". In many ways, it signaled a move from socialism to nationalism. This was made very clear in a speech in 1982, when North Korea celebrated Kim Il-sung's 70th birthday in which love for the nation came before love for socialism. This particularism gave birth to such concepts as A Theory of the Korean Nation as Number One and Socialism of Our Style.\n\nFollowing the death of Kim Jong-il, Kimilsungism was turned into Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism at the 4th Conference of the Workers' Party of Korea. As well as stating that the WPK was \"the party of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il\", Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism was made \"the only guiding idea of the party\". In the 4th Conference's aftermath, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) stated that \"the Korean people have long called the revolutionary policies ideas of the President [Kim Il-sung] and Kim Jong-il as Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism and recognized it as the guiding of the nation\". Kim Jong-un, the WPK First Secretary, said that \"Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is an integral system of the idea, theory and method of \"Juche\" and a great revolutionary ideology representative of the \"Juche\" era. Guided by Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, we should conduct Party building and Party activities, so as to sustain the revolutionary character of our Party and advance the revolution and construction in line with the ideas and intentions of the President and the General.\"\n\nSocialism of Our Style, also referred to as Korean-style socialism and our-style socialism within North Korea, is an ideological concept Kim Jong-il introduced on 27 December 1990 in the speech \"Socialism of Our Country is a Socialism of Our Style as Embodied by the \"Juche\" idea\". Speaking after the Revolutions of 1989 that brought down the Eastern Bloc regimes, Kim Jong-il explicitly stated that North Korea needed—and survived because of—Socialism of Our Style. He argued that socialism in Eastern Europe failed because they \"imitated the Soviet experience in a mechanical manner\". According to Kim, they failed to understand that the Soviet experience was based on specific historical and social circumstances and could not be used by other countries aside from the Soviet Union itself. He added that \"if experience is considered absolute and accepted dogmatically it is impossible to build Socialism properly, as the times change and the specific situation of each country is different from another\". Kim Jong-il went on to criticize \"dogmatic application\" of Marxism–Leninism, stating: \n\nNorth Korea would not encounter such difficulties because of the conceiving of \"Juche\". In his words, North Korea was \"a backward, colonial semifeudal society\" when the Communists took over, but since the North Korean Communists did not accept Marxism because it was based on European capitalist experiences, or Leninism, which was based on Russia's experience, they conceived of \"Juche\". Additionally, he believed the situation in North Korea was also more complex because of the American presence in South Korea. Thanks to Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il argued, the revolution had \"put forward original lines and policies suited to our people's aspirations and the specific situation of our country\". \"The \"Juche\" idea is a revolutionary theory which occupies the highest stage of development of the revolutionary ideology of the working class\", Kim Jong-il said, further stating that the originality and superiority of the \"Juche\" idea defined and strengthened Korean socialism. He then conceded by stating that Socialism of Our Style was \"a man-centered Socialism\", explicitly making a break with basic Marxist–Leninist thought, which argues that material forces are the driving force of historical progress, not people. Socialism of Our Style was presented as an organic sociopolitical theory, using the language of Marxism–Leninism, saying: \n\nUnlike Marxism–Leninism, which considers improvements in the material conditions of production and exchange as the driving force of historical progress (known as historical materialism), \"Juche\" considers human beings in general the driving force in history. It is summarized as \"the popular masses are placed in the center of everything, and the leader is the center of the masses\". \"Juche\", North Korea maintains, is a \"man-centered ideology\" in which the \"man is the master of everything and decides everything\". In contrast to Marxist–Leninist thought in which people's decisions are inextricably linked to their relations to the means of production (a concept referred to as \"relations of production\"), in \"Juche\" thought man is independent and decides everything. Just like Marxist–Leninist thought, \"Juche\" believes history is law-governed, but that it is only man who drives progress, stating that \"the popular masses are the drivers of history\". However, for the masses to be successful, they need a \"Great Leader\". Marxism–Leninism argues that the popular masses will lead (on the basis of their relation to production), but in North Korea the role of a Great Leader should be essential for leadership. This theory allegedly helped Kim Il-sung establish a unitary, one-man rule over North Korea.\n\nThe theory turns the Great Leader into an absolutist, supreme leader. The working class is not to think for themselves, but instead to think through the Great Leader. The Great Leader is the \"top brain\" (i.e. \"mastermind\") of the working class, meaning that he is the only legitimate representative of the working class. Class struggle can be realized only through the Great Leader and difficult tasks in general and revolutionary changes in particular can be introduced only through and by the Great Leader. In historical development, it is the Great Leader who is the leading force of the working class. The Great Leader is also a flawless human being who never commits mistakes, who is always benevolent and who always rules for the masses. The leader is incorruptible. For the Great Leader system to function, a unitary ideological system must be in place. In North Korea, that unitary ideological system is known as the Ten Principles for a Monolithic Ideological System.\n\nUnlike the Joseon dynasty, where there was a huge gap between the upper and lower classes, North Korea had adopted the concept of a gathered-together \"people\". Instead of a strict social hierarchy, North Korea had in theory divided the union into three classes, namely peasant, worker and \"samuwon\" (intellectuals and professionals), where each was just as important as the other. The \"samuwon\" class consisted of clerks, small traders, bureaucrats, professors and writers. This was a unique class that was created to increase education and literacy of North Korea's population.\n\nNormally, Communist nations would value only the farmers or laborers, thus in the Soviet Union the intelligentsia was not defined as an independent class of its own, but rather as a \"social stratum\" that recruited itself from members of almost all classes: proletariat, petite bourgeoisie and bourgeoisie. However, a \"peasant intelligentsia\" was never mentioned. Correspondingly, the \"proletarian intelligentsia\" was exalted for bringing forth progressive scientists and Marxist theoreticians whereas the \"bourgeois intelligentsia\" was condemned for producing \"bourgeois ideology\", which were all non-Marxist worldviews. Language reforms followed revolutions more than once, such as the New Korean Orthography in North Korea (which failed due to Korean ethnic nationalist fears of precluding Korean unification), or the simplification of Chinese characters under Mao Zedong (a consequence of the divergent orthographic choices of Taiwan and the People's Republic of China), or the simplification of the Russian language after the 1917 revolution in Russia and consequent struggle against illiteracy, known in Soviet Russia as \"Likbez\" (\"Likvidaciya Bezgramotnosti\", liquidation of illiteracy).\n\nThey believed in rapid industrialization through labor and in subjecting nature to human will. By restructuring social classes into a mass of people who are theoretically all equal, the North Korean government claimed it would be able to attain self-reliance or \"Juche\" in upcoming years. This is questionable, because the country suffers massive food shortages annually and is heavily dependent on foreign aid.\n\n\"Songun\" (literally \"military-first policy\") was first mentioned on 7 April 1997 in \"Rodong Shinmun\" under the headline \"There Is a Victory for Socialism in the Guns and Bombs of the People's Army\". It defined the military-centered thinking of the time by stating; \"the revolutionary philosophy to safeguard our own style of socialism under any circumstances\". The concept was credited to \"Respected General Kim Jong-il\". In a joint editorial on 16 June 1998 entitled \"Our Party's Military-First Politics Will Inevitably Achieve Victory and Will Never Be Defeated\" by \"Kulloja\" (the WPK theoretical magazine) and \"Rodong Sinmun\", it was stated that \"Songun\" meant \"the leadership method under the principle of giving priority to the military and resolving the problems that may occur in the course of revolution and construction as well as establishing the military as the main body of the revolution in the course of achieving the total tasks of socialism\". While the article clearly referred to \"our Party\", this was not a reference to the WPK but rather to the personal leadership of Kim Jong-il. On 5 September 1998, the North Korean Constitution was revised and it made clear that the National Defence Commission, the highest military body, was the supreme body of the state. This date is considered the beginning of the \"Songun\" era.\n\nIn the view of some observers, \"Juche\" is not mere rhetoric, but rather an ideal of self-reliance that North Korea has attempted to put into practice.\n\nBased \"On the Juche Idea\", Kim Jong-il argued: \"Independence is not in conflict with internationalism but is the basis of its strengthening\". He stated that North Korea co-operated with \"socialist countries\", the \"international communist movement\" and \"newly-emerging nations\" on the basis of non-interference, equality and mutual benefit.\n\nNorth Korea emerged from Soviet occupation and fought alongside the Chinese Communists in the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War. However, it soon asserted its independence from both the Soviet Union and China. Though it rejected de-Stalinization, it avoided taking sides in the Sino-Soviet split. As the Communist bloc split, introduced market reforms and collapsed, North Korea increasingly emphasized \"Juche\" in both theory and practice.\n\nNorth Korea was admitted to the Non-Aligned Movement in 1975 and began to present itself as a leader of the Third World. It fostered diplomatic relations with developing countries and promoted \"Juche\" as a model for others to follow.\n\nNational survival has been seen as a guiding principle of North Korea's diplomatic strategy. Even in the midst of economic and political crises, North Korea continues to emphasize its independence on the world stage.\n\nIn \"On the Juche Idea\", Kim Jong-il stated: \"In order to implement the principle of economic self-sufficiency, one must build an independent national economy\". More specifically, he stated, \"Heavy industry with the machine-building industry as its backbone is the pillar of an independent national economy\". He also emphasized the importance of technological independence and self-sufficiency in resources. However, he stated that this did not rule out international economic co-operation.\n\nIn 1956, Kim Il-sung declared \"Juche\" to be the guiding principle of the economy. After the devastation of the Korean War, North Korea began to rebuild its economy with a base in heavy industry, with the aim of becoming as self-sufficient as possible. As a result, North Korea developed what has been called the \"most autarkic industrial economy in the world\". North Korea received a lot of economic aid and technical assistance from the Soviet Union and China, but it did not join Comecon, the Communist common market. In the 1990s, it had one of the world's lowest rates for dependence on petroleum, using hydroelectric power and coal instead of imported oil. Its textile industry uses vinylon, known as the \"\"Juche\" fiber\", which was invented by a Korean and which is made from locally available coal and limestone. The history of the development of vinylon often featured in propaganda that preached the virtues of technological self-reliance. North Korea had 10,000 CNC machines in 2010. The first domestic homemade CNC machine was introduced in 1995 and in 2017 it has around 15,000 machines.\n\nCommentators have often pointed out the discrepancy between the principle of self-sufficiency and North Korea's dependence on foreign aid, especially during its economic crisis in the 1990s. The pursuit of economic autarky has been blamed for contributing to the crisis. On this view, attempts at self-sufficiency led to inefficiency and to the neglect of export opportunities in industries where there was a comparative advantage.\n\nIn \"On the Juche Idea\", Kim Jong-il stated: \"Self-reliance in defense is a fundamental principle of an independent sovereign state\". He stated that it was possible to get aid from friends and allies, but that this would be effective only if the state was militarily strong in its own right. He advocated a state where \"all the people are under arms and the whole country becomes a fortress\". He also advocated the development of a local defense industry to avoid dependence on foreign arms suppliers.\n\nNorth Korea has attempted to put this into practice. The Korean People's Army is one of the largest on earth. It is currently developing its own nuclear ballistic missile. Domestic production of UDMH fuel for liquid fueled missiles and Tumansky RD-9 Turbojet engine which powers Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 and Shenyang J-6. CNC machines are used for production of missiles and centrifuges. North Korea's propaganda since the Korean War has contrasted its military autonomy with the presence of American forces in the South.\n\nSome South Korean scholars categorize \"Juche\" as a national religion or they compare its facets to those of some religions. For instance, \"Juche\" has been compared to pre-existing religions in Korea (notably neo-Confucianism and Korean shamanism) due to their shared familiar principles. While the influence of traditional East Asian religions on \"Juche\" is widely disputed, the ideology has been thought of by several academic studies as having aspects of a national and indigenous religious movement in addition to being a political philosophy due to the following features: the presence of a sacred leader, rituals and familism. Despite the religious features of \"Juche\", it is a highly atheistic ideology that discourages the practice of mainstream religions. This draws from \"Juche\"s Marxist−Leninist origins. North Korea is officially an atheist state, but maintains a cult of personality identical to a religion, much like the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin.\n\nAlthough the ideology appears to emphasize the central role of the human individual, \"Juche\" can be fulfilled only through the masses’ subordination to a single leader and accordingly, his successor. The ideology teaches that the role of a Great Leader is essential for the popular masses to succeed in their revolutionary movement because without leadership they are unable to survive. This is the foundation of North Korean cult of personality surrounding Kim Il Sung. The personality cult explains how the \"Juche\" ideology has been able to endure until today, even during the North Korean government's undeniable dependence on foreign assistance during its famine in the 1990s. The concept of the \"Sacred leader\" in \"Juche\" as well as the cult around the Kim family has been compared to the State Shinto ideology of Imperial Japan in which the Emperor was seen as a divine being.\n\nThrough the fundamental belief in the essential role of the Great Leader, the former North Korean leader Kim Il-sung has become the \"supreme deity for the people\" and the \"Juche\" doctrine is reinforced in North Korea's constitution as the country’s guiding principle. The parallel relationship structure between Kim Il-sung and his people to religious founders or leaders and their followers has led many scholars to consider \"Juche\" a religious movement as much as a political ideology. However, those familiar with cults would again posit that \"Juche\" bypasses the tenants of religion completely and instead meets the criteria of a totalitarian cult.\n\n\"Juche\"'s emphasis on the political and sacred role of the leader and the ensuing worshipping by the popular masses has been critiqued by various intellectual Marxists. They argue that the North Korean working class or the proletariat has been stripped of their honor and therefore call the cult of personality non-Marxist and non-democratic.\n\nThe religious behavior of \"Juche\" can also be seen in the perspectives of the North Korean people through refugee interviews from former participants in North Korea’s ritual occasions. One pertinent example is the Arirang Festival, which is a gymnastics and artistic festival held in the Rungnado May Day Stadium in Pyongyang. All components of the festival, from the selection of performers, mobilization of resources, recruitment of the audience and publicity for the show have been compared to facets of a national religious event.\n\nThe Arirang Festival has been described to demonstrate the power of the North Korean government to arrange a form of religious gathering. It has done so by \"appropriating a mass of bodies for calisthenic and performative arts representing the leader as the Father and his faithful followers\". The Festival's effectiveness in transforming its participants into loyal disciples of \"Juche\" seems to originate from the collectivist principle of \"one for all and all for one\" and the ensuing emotional bond and loyalty to the leader. According to the accounts of refugees who have been recruited to mass gymnastics, the collectivist principle has been nurtured through physical punishment such as beatings and more importantly the organization of recruits into small units, whose performances were held accountable by larger units. The Festival’s ritualistic components of collectivism serve to reinforce a \"certain structure of sociality and affect\", establishing Kim Il Sung as the \"Father\" in both the body and psyche of the performers.\n\nCharles K. Armstrong argues that familism has transformed itself into a kind of political religion in the form of \"Juche\". With the emergence of \"Juche\" as North Korea's guiding political principle since the 1960s, the familial relationship within the micro-family unit has been translated into a national, macro-unit with Kim Il-sung representing the father figure and the North Korean people representing his children. \"Juche\" is thus based on the language of family relationships with its East Asian or neo-Confucian \"resonances of filial piety and maternal love\".\nArmstrong also notes that North Korea has actually transferred the \"filial piety of nationalism in the family of the leader himself\" by positioning Kim Il-sung as the universal patriarch. He argues that while the official pursuit of the \"Juche\" ideology in the 1960s signaled North Korea's desire to separate from the \"fraternity of international socialism\", the ideology also replaced Stalin as the father figure with Kim Il-sung. In effect, North Korea's familial nationalism has supplanted the \"rather abstract, class-oriented language of socialism with a more easily understandable and identifiable language of familial connections, love and obligations\".\n\nThe cult of personality surrounding Kim expanded into a family cult when Kim Jong Il became the heir apparent after assuming important posts in the WPK and military in the early 1980s. Armstrong calls this a \"family romance\", which is a term Freud had used to describe \"the neurotic replacement of a child's real parents with fantasy substitutes\". Through the establishment of the North Korean family romance with the language, symbols and rituals related to familism, Kim Il Sung has been consecrated even further posthumously as the Great Father.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the North Korean regime became increasingly nationalistic—at least, in its official pronouncements—leading Kim Chonghun to state that \"Socialism of our Style\" was really \"Socialism without Socialism\". Speeches and official announcements made references to socialism, but neither to Marxist–Leninist thought nor to any basic communist concepts. Shin Gi-wook argues that \"there is no trace of Marxist–Leninism or the Stalinist notion of nationhood [in North Korea]. Instead, Kim stresses the importance of the Korean people's blood, soul and national traits, echoing earlier Korean nationalists such as Sin Chaeho, Yi Kwangsu and Choe Namson. He no longer has any interest in applying Marxism–Leninism to the North Korean situation; indeed it is no longer useful for the country\".\n\nCharles K. Armstrong says that \"North Korean Communism would not only be quite distinctive from the Soviet model, it would in some respects turn Marxism–Leninism upside-down\". The key differences are that the North Koreans place the primacy of ideology over materialism, retaining the vocabulary of family lineage and nationalism and giving it primacy over class struggle and supporting social distinction and hierarchy over classless society and egalitarianism. He concluded that North Korea may look \"Stalinist in form\", but that it was \"nationalist in content\".\n\nBrian Reynolds Myers dismisses the idea that \"Juche\" is North Korea's leading ideology, regarding its public exaltation as designed to deceive foreigners. He argues that it exists to be praised and not actually read. Based on his own experiences living in North Korea, Felix Abt describes Myers' arguments as \"shaky\" and \"questionable\". Having seen the extent to which North Korean university students actually believe in \"Juche\", Abt says it is \"rather absurd\" to describe the ideology as \"window-dressing\" for foreigners. He also questions how only three decades of Japanese occupation could simply upend the impact of \"thousands of years\" of history in Korea.\n\nDae-Sook Suh has stated that Kim-Il Sung had failed to explain the difference between Socialist patriotism and nationalism which Kim stated he opposed. Suh also criticised Kim for allegedly failing to explain how Marxism–Leninism has been applied to Korean conditions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is properly confined to the coat of skin without sleeves and used to be worn by the Khoikhoi and Bushmen / San peoples of South Africa. These karosses became replaced by a blanket. Their chiefs wore karosses of the skin of the wild cat, leopard or caracal. The word is also loosely applied to the cloaks of leopard-skin worn by the chiefs and principal men of several southern African tribes. Kaross is probably either a genuine Khoikhoi word, or else an adaptation of the Dutch kuras (), a cuirass. In a vocabulary dated 1673 \"karos\" is described as a \"corrupt Dutch word.\"\n\nThese days the kaross is a common tourist item, being made of various animal hides including cowhide. The term is loosely applied in modern times to fur blankets sold as bedding. These \"karosses\" often have panels of different types of animal fur sewn into them in order to make a decorative pattern.\n"}
{"id": "2584964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2584964", "title": "Latte stone", "text": "Latte stone\n\nA latte stone, or simply latte (also latde or latti), is a pillar (Chamorro language: \"haligi\") capped by a hemispherical stone capital (\"tasa\") with the flat side facing up. Used as building supports by the ancient Chamorro people, they are found throughout most of the Mariana Islands. In modern times, the latte stone is seen as a sign of Chamorro identity and is used in many different contexts.\n\nLatte stones have been made of limestone, basalt, or sandstone. Typical pillars range in height from 60 centimeters to three meters, and generally narrow towards the top. The pillar was normally quarried and then transported to the construction site. For small to medium-sized lattes, the capstone was a large hemispherical coral head that was gathered from a reef. The massive capstones found in Rota were instead quarried, like the pillars.\n\nIn Oceania the latte stone is unique to the Marianas, though megaliths of differing construction and purpose are common to Oceanic cultures. Similarities between the latte stone and the wood posts made by the Ifugao sub-group of the Igorot in the Philippines, on which they build rice stores, have been pointed out. The rounded capstones help prevent rats from climbing up the pillar. A similar wood post construction appears to be depicted in a relief carving at Borobodur, Java, which has caused one scholar to put forward the disputed theory of a prehistorical cultural exchange between the Marianas and Java.\n\nLatte stones varied greatly in size. The smallest were several feet tall. The largest latte still standing is 16 feet (5m) tall, located in Tinian. In Rota, quarried latte would have stood 25 feet (8m) high if erected. The largest shaft found here weighs 34 tons while the largest cap weighs 22 tons.\n\nThe history of the pre-contact Marianas is usually divided into three periods: Pre-Latte, Transitional Pre-Latte, and Latte. Latte stones began to be used in about 800 A.D. and became increasingly more common until the arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 and Spanish colonization, when they fell rapidly out of use and were entirely abandoned by about 1700. Latte stones have been found on Guam and the southern islands in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, including Rota, Tinian, Aguijan, and Saipan, as well as several small northern islands, such as Pagan.\n\nUndisturbed stones are found usually arranged in parallel pairs of between eight and fourteen lattes framing a rectangular space. The more pairs in the structure, the taller the latte stones. One twenty latte arrangement was found in the current location of the military Ordnance Annex on southern Guam. While none of the early European visitors to the islands appear to have drawn pictures of latte stones in use, several Spanish accounts from the 16th and 17th centuries state that houses were erected on the stones, with one eyewitness specifying that the structures on lattes were used to shelter proas and served as community meeting places. However, the lack of definitive, consistent evidence means that all theories are disputed. Some archaeologists believe that only high status Chamorros lived in structures built on latte stones, while others have put forward the theory that all Chamorros in the Latte Period lived in latte structures, and that the height and number of the stones in the structure indicated social status. Other structures in a latte village, which may have included cooking huts, canoe houses and public houses for unmarried men, were built on the ground, typically in an A-frame of wood poles, often bamboo, with thatched roofs of grass, coconut fronds or Nipa fronds.\n\nArchaeologists who have worked in the Marianas since the end of World War II have noted a distinct difference between latte stones located along the coast and those located inland. Coastal latte tend to be placed in sand containing extensive relics of habitation, including shards of pottery, fish and animal bones, and stone and shell tools. Human burials were placed within sand containing these archaeological remnants, either within or near sets of lattes. In contrast, the soil in which inland latte stones are placed rarely has an archaeological stratum or associated burial. The implication is that mainland latte sites were temporarily occupied, and perhaps that there was a change in burial practice in the later Latte Period.\nBy the 18th and 19th centuries, travelers to the Marianas noted lattes only in abandoned areas, where they had apparently been left after foreign-introduced disease had decimated the Chamorro population. In modern times, latte stones are a symbol of Chamorro identity and are found in a wide variety of government, business and personal contexts. Concrete lattes are sometimes incorporated into new buildings, while residents of the Marianas will sometimes incorporate actual latte stones into the landscaping around their homes.\n\nA latte stone features on the US quarter coin for the Northern Marianas Islands.

{"id": "33494733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33494733", "title": "Library history", "text": "Library history\n\nLibrary history is a subdiscipline within library science and library and information science focusing on the history of libraries and their role in societies and cultures. Some see the field as a subset of information history Library history is an academic discipline and should not be confused with its object of study (history of libraries): the discipline is much younger than the libraries it studies. Library history begins in ancient societies through contemporary issues facing libraries today. Topics include recording mediums, cataloguing systems, scholars, scribes, library supporters and librarians.\n\nThe earliest records of a library institution as it is presently understood can be dated back to around 5,000 years ago in the Southwest Asian regions of the world. During the time, civilizations that began to keep records would do so by writing on mediums that ranged from clay tablets, bones, skin, bamboo, to papyrus. One of the oldest libraries found is that of the ancient library at Ebla (circa 2500 BCE) in present-day Syria. In the 1970s, the excavation at Ebla's library unearthed over 20,000 clay tablets written in cuneiform script.\n\nThe Al Qarawiyyin Library was founded in 859 by Fatima al-Fihri and is the oldest working library in the world. It is in Fez, Morocco and is part of the oldest continually operating university in the world, the University of al-Qarawiyyin. The library houses approximately 4,000 ancient Islamic manuscripts. These manuscripts include 9th century Qurans and the oldest known accounts of the Islamic prophet Muhammed.\n\nThe Assyrian King Assurbanipal created one of the greatest libraries in Nineveh in the seventh century BCE. The collection consisted of over 30,000 tablets written in a variety of languages. The collection was cataloged both by the shape of the tablet and by the subject of the content (Murray, 2009, p. 8-9).\n\nThe Greek government was the first to sponsor public libraries. By 500 BCE both Athens and Samos had begun creating libraries for the public, though as most of the population was illiterate these spaces were serving a small, educated portion of the community (Murray, 2009, p. 14).\n\nThe library at Alexandria, Egypt, was renowned in the third century BCE while kings Ptolemy I Soter and Ptolemy II Philadelphus reigned. The library included a museum, garden, meeting areas and of course reading rooms (Lyons, 2011, p. 26-27). The Great Library, as it is known, was one of many in Alexandria. Beginning at its inception through the first century BCE Alexandria was a well known center for learning, the quantity and quality of the libraries speak to this renown (Murray, 2009, p. 17).\n\nIt wasn't until the Middle Ages that libraries became a part of culture. During the Renaissance era, more people became educated and relied on libraries as a place to study and gain knowledge. During the Renaissance most of the text held in libraries were religious text. Libraries helped enrich the culture of those who were educated by providing this valuable resource otherwise unavailable.\n\n\nIn the early 19th and 20th century, representative titles were created reporting library history in the United States and the United Kingdom. American titles include: \"Public Libraries in the United States of America, Their History, Condition, and Management\" (1876), \"Memorial History of Boston\" (1881) by Justin Winsor, \"Public Libraries in America\" (1894) by William I. Fletcher, and \"History of the New York Public Library\" (1923) by Henry M. Lydenberg. British titles include: \"Old English Libraries\" (1911) by Earnest A. Savage and T\"he Chained Library: A Survey of Four Centuries in the Evolution of the English Library\" by Burnett Hillman Streeter.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, library historians began applying scientific research methodologies to examine the library as a social agency. Two works that demonstrate this argument are \"Geschichte der Bibliotheken\" (1925) by Alfred Hessel and the \"Library Quarterly\" article from 1931, “The Sociological Beginnings of the Library Movement in America” by Arnold Borden.\nWith the establishment of library schools, master’s theses and doctoral dissertations represented the shift in serious research regarding libraries and library history. Two published doctoral dissertations that mark this trend are \"Foundations of the Public Library: The Origins of the American Public Library Movement in New England, 1629 – 1855\" (1940) by Jesse Shera and \"Arsenals of a Democratic Culture: A Social History of the American Public Library Movement in New England and the Middle Atlantic States From 1850 to 1900\" (1947). Additional models of library historical analysis include: \"The New York Public Library: A History of Its Founding and Early Years\" by Phyllis Dain, a work that exemplified institutional history and \"The Power and the Dignity: Librarianship and Katharine L. Sharp\" by Laurel Grotzinger, a biographical study.\n\nThe earliest methods of cataloging involved storing tablets separately based on their content. The subject matter was identified by small descriptions or \ncolor coding. Common practice was to have different rooms or chambers for the various subject types. Moving to the Renaissance period, cataloging took on a whole new level. Materials were still stored by content, but now titles were being listed and organized alphabetically. Catalogs were kept in ledger form listing all the materials in the collection, new additions added at the margins, until a librarian would redraft the catalog. Maintaining and revising the catalog became crucially important as collections grew. It was during the Renaissance period that one would find the first catalogs that referenced other collections to make finding materials easier. As printing grew, so did the need for accurate catalogs of material available. Additionally catalogs needed to be descriptive enough to help librarians in the locating and storing of books. As collections grew, so naturally did catalogs. Materials continued to be separated by subject and would then be further divided by more specific heading, still listed and stored within these sub headings alphabetically.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Because much of the carbon consumed by organisms in the ocean is older than that consumed by organisms on land, samples from marine life and from organisms that consumed a lot of sea-based foods while alive may appear older than they truly are when tested. It is necessary to account for changes in the Earth's oceans to correct for the marine reservoir effect.\n\nTypically, affected radiocarbon dates appear c. 400 C years older than they would if unaffected. But the effect is highly variable in space and time, and can reach 800 to 1200 C years in Arctic regions.\n\nSince its initial discovery in the 1980s, a Viking burial site in England confounded archeologists. It contained coins and other physical materials associated with the late 800s c.e., the time of the Great Danish Army, but the radiocarbon dating placed the roughly 300 bodies within at a variety of different dates spanning centuries. In February 2018, a team out of the University of Bristol published a study attributing this to the large amounts of sea-based foods eaten by Vikings and placed the burial site in the late 800s.\n"}
{"id": "291796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=291796", "title": "Medical fetishism", "text": "Medical fetishism\n\nMedical fetishism refers to a number of sexual fetishes involving objects, practices, environments, and situations of a medical or clinical nature. In sexual roleplay a hospital or medical scene involves the sex partners assuming the roles of doctors, nurses, surgeons and patients to act out specific or general medical fetishes. Medical fantasy is a genre in pornography, though the fantasy may not necessarily involve pornography or sexual activity.\n\nMedical fetishism may involve sexual attraction to respiratory therapy involving oxygen via nasal cannula or any sort of masks, medical practitioners, medical uniforms, hospital gowns, anaesthesia, intimate examinations (such as rectal examination, gynecological examination, urological examination, andrological examination, rectal temperature-taking), catheterization, diapering, enemas, injections, insertion (such as suppository insertion, menstrual-cup insertion, and prostatic massage), medical devices (such as orthopedic casts and orthopedic braces; see also \"Abasiophilia\"), dental objects (such as dental braces, retainers, and headgear), medical restraints, and medical gags.\n\nSome people eroticize about intimate examinations as part of a medical fetish, and as such are a common service offered by professional dominants.\n\nAn intimate examination can form part of a scene in medical play where the nurse or doctor inflicts one or more embarrassing and humiliating quasi-medical procedures on the patient. Often frozen or heated objects are introduced to the patient's body to simulate the uncomfortable sensations that can occur during a real examination. Examinations may include an examination and intrusion of the anus, urethra, or vagina, as well as handling and twisting of the penis, testicles, clitoris, and nipples. Quite often, strap on play is also incorporated, as this can heighten the intimacy, and also the sensations of the patient. This may be a prelude to masturbation or administration of an enema. Before examination, the patient can be placed in physical restraints and gagged, and wear some form of embarrassing clothing.\n\nTemperature taking fetish is a sexual fetish for oral thermometers and rectal thermometers. This may include the sexual attraction to the equipment, processes, environments or scenarios/situations. Sexual arousal from the desire to take another's temperature or have one's temperature taken is primarily what surrounds the fetish. While rectal temperature taking is more prominent, there is also an interest in oral temperature taking.\n\nAnesthesia fetishism is a sexual fetish for anesthesia. This may include the sexual attraction to the equipment, processes, substances, effects, environments or situations. Sexual arousal from the desire to administer anesthesia, or the sexual desire for oneself to be anesthetized are two forms in which an individual may exist as an arbiter of the fetish. Older-style anesthesia masks of black rubber, still in occasional use today, are one of the more common elements fetishized, and have earned the nickname \"Black Beauty\" by many fetishists.\n\nAnesthesia fetish is considered edgeplay when realised outside the boundaries of fantasy, and may result in various degrees of harm, or death. Fantasies are elaborated by the viewing of images and reading of stories of anesthetic inductions. Edgeplay may involve obtaining and scening with various anesthesia-related paraphernalia—usually anesthesia masks for breathplay, the acquisition of anesthetics for anesthetizing others or being anesthetized oneself, and the occupation of a medical setting or environment for the same practice.\n\nSome anesthesia fetishists who seek to be anesthetized may feign or induce medical conditions in an attempt to obtain general anesthesia from medical personnel. This is considered safer than playing with anesthetic agents outside of a medical setting, but may nevertheless be an abuse of all concerned.\n\nThe Internet has enabled people with this relatively rare paraphilia to discuss the subject and exchange anesthesia-related multimedia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20807", "title": "Merlin", "text": "Merlin\n\nMerlin () is a legendary figure best known as the wizard featured in Arthurian legend and medieval Welsh poetry. The standard depiction of the character first appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", written c. 1136, and is based on an amalgamation of previous historical and legendary figures. Geoffrey combined existing stories of Myrddin Wyllt (or Merlinus Caledonensis), a North Brythonic prophet and madman with no connection to King Arthur, with tales of the Romano-British war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus to form the composite figure he called Merlin Ambrosius (). \n\nGeoffrey's rendering of the character was immediately popular, especially in Wales. Later writers expanded the account to produce a fuller image of the wizard. Merlin's traditional biography casts him as a cambion: born of a mortal woman, sired by an incubus, the non-human from whom he inherits his supernatural powers and abilities. Merlin matures to an ascendant sagehood and engineers the birth of Arthur through magic and intrigue. Later authors have Merlin serve as the king's advisor and mentor to the knights until he is bewitched and forever imprisoned or killed by the Lady of the Lake. He is popularly said to be buried in the magical forest of Brocéliande.\n\nThe name \"Merlin\" is derived from the Welsh \"Myrddin\", the name of the bard who was one of the chief sources for the later legendary figure. Geoffrey of Monmouth Latinised the name to Merlinus in his works. Medievalist Gaston Paris suggests that Geoffrey chose the form \"Merlinus\" rather than the regular \"Merdinus\" to avoid a resemblance to the Anglo-Norman word \"merde\" (from Latin \"merda\") for feces.\n\nClas Myrddin or \"Merlin's Enclosure\" is an early name for Great Britain stated in the Third Series of Welsh Triads. Celticist A. O. H. Jarman suggests that the Welsh name \"\" () was derived from the toponym \"Caerfyrddin\", the Welsh name for the town known in English as Carmarthen. This contrasts with the popular folk etymology that the town was named for the bard. The name Carmarthen is derived from the town's previous Roman name Moridunum, in turn derived from Celtic Brittonic \"moridunon\", \"sea fortress\".\n\nGeoffrey's composite Merlin is based primarily on the legendary \"madman\" poet and seer Myrddin Wyllt (\"Myrddin the Wild\", sometimes called \"Merlinus Caledonensis\" in later sources influenced by Geoffrey), and \"Emrys\" (Old Welsh: \"Embreis\"), a fictional character based in part on the 5th century, historical war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus mentioned in one of Geoffrey's primary sources, the early 9th century \"Historia Brittonum\". The former had nothing to do with King Arthur: in British poetry he was a bard driven mad after witnessing the horrors of war, who fled civilization to become a wild man of the wood in the 6th century. Geoffrey had \"Myrddin Wyllt\" in mind when he wrote his earliest surviving work, the \"Prophetiae Merlini\" (\"Prophecies of Merlin\"), which he claimed were the actual words of the legendary poet and madman.\n\nGeoffrey's \"Prophetiae\" do not reveal much about Merlin's background. He included the prophet in his next work, \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", supplementing the characterisation by attributing to him stories about Aurelius Ambrosius, taken from Nennius' \"Historia Brittonum\". According to Nennius, Ambrosius was discovered when the British king Vortigern was trying to erect a tower. The tower always collapsed before completion, and his wise men told him that the only solution was to sprinkle the foundation with the blood of a child born without a father. Ambrosius was rumoured to be such a child but, when brought before the king, he revealed the real reason for the tower's collapse: below the foundation was a lake containing two dragons who fought a battle representing the struggle between the invading Saxons and the native Celtic Britons. Geoffrey retells this story in his \"Historia Regum Britanniæ\" with some embellishments, and gives the fatherless child the name of the prophetic bard Merlin. He keeps this new figure separate from Aurelius Ambrosius and, with regard to his changing of the original Nennian character, he states that Ambrosius was also called 'Merlin'—that is, 'Ambrosius Merlinus'. He goes on to add new episodes that tie Merlin with King Arthur and his predecessors.\n\nGeoffrey's account of Merlin Ambrosius' early life in the \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" is based on the tale of Ambrosius in the \"Historia Brittonum\". He adds his own embellishments to the tale, which he sets in Carmarthen, Wales (Welsh: Caerfyrddin). While Nennius' Ambrosius eventually reveals himself to be the son of a Roman consul, Geoffrey's Merlin is begotten on a king's daughter by an incubus demon. (The name of Merlin's mother is not usually stated, but is given as Adhan in the oldest version of the Prose \"Brut\".) The story of Vortigern's tower is essentially the same; the underground dragons, one white and one red, represent the Saxons and the Britons, and their final battle is a portent of things to come. At this point Geoffrey inserts a long section of Merlin's prophecies, taken from his earlier \"Prophetiae Merlini\". He tells only two further tales of the character. In the first, Merlin creates Stonehenge as a burial place for Aurelius Ambrosius, bringing the stones from the Preseli Hills in south-west Wales and Ireland. In the second, Merlin's magic enables the new British king Uther Pendragon to enter into Tintagel in disguise and father his son Arthur with his enemy's wife, Igraine. These episodes appear in many later adaptations of Geoffrey's account. As Lewis Thorpe notes, Merlin disappears from the narrative after this; he does not tutor and advise Arthur as in later versions.\n\nGeoffrey dealt with Merlin again in his third work, \"Vita Merlini\". He based it on stories of the original 6th-century Myrddin, set long after his time frame for the life of Merlin Ambrosius. Geoffrey tried to assert that the characters are the same with references to King Arthur and his death, as told in the \"Historia Regum Britanniae\". Here, Merlin survives Arthur, is married to a woman named Guendoloena, and spends his time observing stars from his home with seventy windows in the remote woods in the land of Rhydderch, where he is often visited by his beautiful sister Ganieda (based on Myrddin's sister Gwendydd) who has become queen of the Cumbrians.\n\nNikolai Tolstoy hypothesizes that Merlin is based on a historical personage, probably a 6th-century druid living in southern Scotland. His argument is based on the fact that early references to Merlin describe him as possessing characteristics which modern scholarship (but not that of the time the sources were written) would recognize as druidical—the inference being that those characteristics were not invented by the early chroniclers, but belonged to a real person. If so, the hypothetical Merlin would have lived about a century after the hypothetical historical Arthur. A late version of the \"Annales Cambriae\" (dubbed the \"B-text\", written at the end of the 13th century) and influenced by Geoffrey, records for the year 573, that after \"the battle of Arfderydd, between the sons of Eliffer and Gwenddolau son of Ceidio; in which battle Gwenddolau fell; Merlin went mad.\" The earliest version of the \"Annales Cambriae\" entry (in the \"A-text\", written c. 1100), as well as a later copy (the \"C-text\", written towards the end of the 13th century) do not mention Merlin.\n\nSeveral decades later, Robert de Boron retold and expanded on this material in his poem \"Merlin\" written around 1200. Only a few lines of the poem have survived, but a prose retelling became popular and was later incorporated into chivalric romances. In Robert's account, as in Geoffrey's \"Historia\", Merlin is begotten by a demon on a virgin as the intended Antichrist. This plot is thwarted when the expectant mother informs her confessor Blaise of her predicament; they immediately baptize the boy at birth, thus freeing him from the power of Satan and his intended destiny. The demonic legacy invests Merlin with a preternatural knowledge of the past and present, which is supplemented by God, who gives the boy a prophetic knowledge of the future. Robert lays great emphasis on Merlin's power to shapeshift, on his joking personality, and on his connection to the Holy Grail, the quest for which he foretells. Robert was inspired by Wace's \"Roman de Brut\", an Anglo-Norman adaptation of Geoffrey's \"Historia\". \"Merlin\" was originally a part of a cycle of Robert's poems, which tells the story of the Grail that gathered the blood of Christ: brought to Britain by followers of Joseph of Arimathea, the Grail is eventually recovered by Arthur's knight Percival. \n\nRobert's poem was rewritten and continued in prose in the 13th century as the \"Estoire de Merlin\", also called the Vulgate \"Merlin \"or Prose \"Merlin\". It is a part of the vast Lancelot-Grail\",\" also known as the Vulgate Cycle, where (in the Prose \"Lancelot\") it is said that Merlin actually was never baptized. It was further expanded with the Post-Vulgate \"Suite du Merlin\" (also known as \"Merlin Continuation\" or the Huth \"Merlin\"), which describes King Arthur's many early wars and the role of Merlin in them. Another continuation, written after the Vulgate Cycle\",\" is the \"Livre d'Artus\", where Merlin's shapeshifting powers are also featured prominently. These works were adapted and translated into several other languages. Notably, the Post-Vulgate \"Suite\" was the source for the early parts of Sir Thomas Malory's influential English language \"Le Morte d'Arthur\".\n\nLater medieval works also deal with the Merlin legend. One, \"Les Prophéties de Merlin\" (c. 1276) contains long prophecies of Merlin (mostly concerned with 11th to 13th-century Italian history and contemporary politics), some by his ghost after his death, interspersed with episodes relating Merlin's deeds and with various Arthurian adventures in which Merlin does not appear at all. The earliest English verse romance concerning Merlin is \"Of Arthour and of Merlin\", which drew from the chronicles and the French Lancelot-Grail. \n\nAs the Arthurian myths were retold and embellished, Merlin's prophetic aspects were sometimes de-emphasised in favour of portraying him as a wizard and an elder advisor to Arthur. His role could be embellished and added to that of Aurelianus Ambrosius, or he could be made into just one of old Uther's favourite advisors.\n\nMerlin's apprentice is often Morgan le Fay (in the \"Prophéties de Merlin\" along with Sebile and two other witch queens), Arthur's half-sister and sometimes Merlin's lover. Contrary to the many modern works, Merlin and Morgan are never enemies in any medieval tradition. In fact, Merlin loves Morgan so much, that he even lies to Arthur (in the Huth \"Merlin\", which is the only instance of him ever doing such a thing) in order to save her. In the Lancelot-Grail and later accounts, Merlin's eventual undoing came from his lusting after a woman often named Nimue or Viviane (among various names and spellings), another female student of his and an unrequited love interest. Merlin's downfall and demise or eternal imprisonment is recounted differently in various versions of the narrative. The enchanted prison can be a cave (as in the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a large rock (as in \"Le Morte d'Arthur\"), an invisible tower, or a tree; in one version, Nimue confines him in the enchanted forest of Brocéliande with walls of air, visible as mist to others but as a beautiful tower to him. In some texts, including in \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", Nimue then replaces Merlin in the role of Arthur's court mage and adviser as a Lady of the Lake.\n\nIn the \"Prophéties de Merlin\", his tomb is unsuccessfully searched for by various parties, including by Morgan and her enchantresses, but cannot be accessed. The legendary Brocéliande is often identified as the real-life Paimpont forest in Brittany. Other purported sites of Merlin's burial include Drumelzier in Tweeddale in Scotland and Carmarthen on Ynys Enlli off the coast of Wales. Both of these locations are also associated with Merlin more generally, including in the 13th-century manuscript known as the \"Black Book of Carmarthen\" and in the local lore of Merlin's Oak in the latter case.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30098451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30098451", "title": "Music piracy", "text": "Music piracy\n\nMusic piracy is the copying and distributing of recordings of a piece of music for which the rights owners (composer, recording artist, or copyright-holding record company) did not give consent. In the contemporary legal environment, it is a form of copyright infringement, which may be either a civil wrong or a crime depending on jurisdiction. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw much controversy over the ethics of redistributing media content, how much production and distribution companies in the media were losing, and the very scope of what ought to be considered piracy — and cases involving the piracy of music were among the most frequently discussed in the debate.\n\nThe invention of the internet and digital media created music piracy in its modern form. With the invention of newer technology that allowed for the piracy process to become less complicated, it became much more common. Users of the web began adding media files to the internet, and prior potential risks and difficulties to pirating music, such as the physicality of the process, were eliminated. It was much easier for people with little to no knowledge of technology and old piracy methods to gather media files.\n\nThe first application that demonstrated the implications of music piracy was Napster. Napster enabled users to exchange music files over a common free server without any regard for copyright laws. Napster was quickly shut down after lawsuits filed by Metallica and Dr. Dre and a separate lawsuit in regards to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Other music sharing services such as Limewire continued to be a resource to those searching for free music files. These platforms were also removed after a few years of service due to copyright laws and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. After finding some loopholes, piracy began to exist in more legal forms, an example being Pirate Bay. This technical legality was due to the format of the websites and their country of origin and administration. The websites were set up so that the site itself did not host any of the illegal files, but gave the user a map as to where they could access the files. Additionally, in Pirate Bay's case, the website was hosted under Swedish law, where this “map” was not illegal.\n\nIn face of the growing encroachment on potential sales from internet piracy, industry associations like the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) have lobbied for stricter laws and stricter punishment of those breaking copyright law. Record companies have also turned to technological barriers to copying, such as DRM, to some controversy. These organizations have tried to add more controls to the digital copy of the music to prevent consumers from copying the music. For the most part, the industry has come to a consensus that, if not DRM, then some similar measures are necessary for them to continue to make a profit.\n\nCritics of the record companies' strategy have proposed that the attempts to maintain sales rates are impeding the rights of legitimate listeners to use and listen to the music as they wish. When the US Congress passed the Copyright Act of 1909, it deliberately gave less copyright control to music composers than that of novelists: \"Its fear was the monopoly power of rights holders, and that that power would stifle follow-on creativity\". According to the internationally established Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \"Existing laws and regulations may be too broad and general to deal adequately with the rapid technological developments that facilitate digital piracy, and policy makers may need to consider enacting some specific provisions to deal with these infringements. Such provisions should not unduly impede legitimate digital communications, nor unreasonably impact on the Internet as an effective communications platform, commercial channel and educational tool...\"\n\nThere have been several means of free access to copyrighted music for the general public including Napster, Limewire, and Spotify. Napster was a free file sharing software created by college student Shawn Fanning to enable people to share and trade music files in mp3 format. Napster became hugely popular because it made it so easy to share and download music files. However, the heavy metal band Metallica sued the company for copyright infringement. This led to other artists following suit and shutting down Napster’s service. Likewise, Limewire was a free peer-to-peer file sharing software similar to that of Napster. The software enabled unlimited file sharing between computers and ended being one of the most popular sharing networks around. Like Napster, Limewire struggled through multiple legal battles and inevitably wound up being shut down. Spotify and other on-demand streaming services are offering a way for consumers to still get their music for free while also contributing to the musician in a small way instead of simply illegally downloading the music, but it also moves customers away from buying hard copies of music or even legally downloading songs which is severely reducing artists' income. \n\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) since Shawn Fanning started the program file sharing program Napster in 1999 music revenue has gone down 53% from $14.6 billion to $7.0 billion in 2013. A study done in 2007 by the Institute of Policy Innovation states that music piracy resulted in a loss of 71,060 U.S. jobs, out of which 23,860 would have been in the recording industry and 44,200 jobs in other unrelated industries.\n\nThe RIAA, a powerful lobby for the recording industry, is responsible for carrying out most of the lawsuits against music piracy in the United States. Some claim that the enforcement against music piracy, which may cost copyright violators up to $150,000 per infringement, is unreasonable, and that it may even violate United States constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. Some have accused the RIAA of outright bullying, as when one of their lawyers, Matt Oppenheimer, told the defendant in one lawsuit, “You don’t want to pay another visit to a dentist like me\". In that same case, according to Lawrence Lessig, \"the RIAA insisted it would not settle the case until it took every penny [the defendant] had saved\".\n\nFurther attempts at progress towards controlling the privacy of public media content by targeting the elimination of piracy were made when the highly anticipated yet often debated bill known as the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) was passed in recent years. The bill was first introduced in October 2011 by the United States House representative Lamar S. Smith. The general scope of the law was to fulfill the goal of putting a stop to online piracy by expanding upon existing criminal laws regarding copyright violations. The essential goal of the bill was to protect intellectual property of content creators by raising awareness of the severity of punishments for copyright infringement. Naturally, the bill was met with considerable opposition from various parties. One instance of this was an article comment by Edward J. Black, president and CEO of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, who questioned the potential effectiveness of the bill by reasoning that the major pirate websites that SOPA attempts to eliminate could just as easily respawn under a different name if taken down as early as a few hours later. Additionally, strong protest attempts were made across the internet when numerous high-profile online organizations including Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, and participating in American Censorship Day on January 18, with some sites including Reddit and Wikipedia going as far as completely blacking out all of their pages, redirecting the user to SOPA protest messages. Ultimately, as a result of aggressive protests and lack of consenting opinions within the congress, SOPA was tabled on January 20 by its creator, House representative Lamar Smith.\n\nPiracy's real effect on music sales is difficult to accurately assess. In neoclassical economics prices are determined by the combination of the forces of supply and demand, but the participators in the digital market do not always follow the usual motives and behaviors of the supply and demand system. First, the cost of digital distribution has decreased significantly from the costs of distribution by former methods. Furthermore, the majority of the filesharing community will distribute copies of music for a zero price in monetary terms, and there are some consumers who are willing to pay a certain price for legitimate copies even when they could just as easily obtain pirated copies, such as with pay what you want vendors.\n\nAnother issue is that because many people in the world illegally download music because they cannot afford to purchase legitimate copies, not every illegal download necessarily equates to a lost sale. This has some effect on music sales, but as Lawrence Lessig points out, there is wide asymmetry between the estimated volume of illegal downloading and the projected loss of sales:\n\nAccording to Woolley's introduction each year It is estimated that 12.5 billion dollars are lost due to file sharing and music piracy, and 5 billion of that is profits lost from the music industry directly. Due to this dramatic loss in profits the music industry has been forced to cut down their staffing. Music piracy has become such an issue that the industry is encouraged to adapt to this new era and change.\n\nThe article, \"The Music Industry On (The) Line? Surviving Music Piracy In A Digital Era\" By Jelle Janssens, Stijn Vandaele, and Tom Vander Beken presents an analysis of the prevalence of piracy in music trade, which has affected the global sales of CDs. This article points out that technological development such as file sharing, MP3 players, and CDRs have increased music piracy. The most common forms of music piracy are Internet Piracy and compact disc piracy. It also discusses the association between music piracy and organized crime, which is defined as profit-driven illegal activities. The fact that digital products are virtual instead of physical affects the economic mechanisms behind the production and distribution of content, and how piracy works for digital as opposed to physical products: \"the main consequence of the non-physical form of digital products is their virtually negligible marginal cost of reproduction and their ability to be digitally delivered.\" The cost of burning a CD drastically lowered the overhead for record companies, as well as for music pirates, and with the growing tendency toward online distribution among legitimate and illicit distributors alike, the expense of distributing shrunk further from the costs of printing and transporting CDs to merely the costs of maintaining a website. By sheer volume of file transfers, though, distributing music through traditional web servers and FTP servers were not as popular as peer to peer (P2P) now, because the traditional direct download method is slower.\n\nThe 2008 British Music Rights survey showed that 80% of people in Britain wanted a legal P2P service. This was consistent with the results of earlier research conducted in the United States, upon which the Open Music Model was based. In addition, the majority of filesharers in the survey preferred to get their music from \"local sources\" such as LAN connections, email, flash drives, sharing with other people they know personally. The other most common method of filesharing was with P2P technologies. By 2007, P2P networks' popularity had grown so much that they used as much as 39% of the total volume of information exchanged over the internet.\n\nAlongside the RIAA and BPI's industry anti-piracy service sit a number of other independent companies offering anti-piracy solutions. \nThese companies tend to have a better reach and success rate than the slower industry bodies and provide an alternative solution. Notable market leaders include AudioLock, Web Sheriff, Topple Track, Detecnet, Muso and Attributor.\n\nThere are ways to minimise music piracy on using the latest Google court decisions on the right to be forgotten as well as using some proven techniques relating to adding a watermark to the tracks and uploading the files yourself with promotional intent.\n\nA paper called the Music Anti-Piracy Best Practise Guidelines has been published by music anti-piracy specialists AudioLock and endorsed by the Association of Independent Music, the Association For Electronic Music (AFEM), music distributors Believe Digital and Judge Jules (DJ and Lawyer). These guidelines give advice on how to minimise exposure to music-piracy and how best to utilise the solutions that are available.\n\nStatistics have shown that since the latter half the 2000s, there has been a decline in music piracy. According to a NPD survey, in 2012, approximately one in ten Internet users in the United States downloaded music through a file sharing service similar to BitTorrent or LimeWire. This number is significantly less than 2005, the peak of the piracy phenomenon, when one in five users used peer-to-peer networks to gather music files. The emergence of free streaming services has decreased the number of users who pirate music on the internet. Services such as Spotify and Pandora have easy-to-use interfaces and decrease the risk for computer viruses and spyware. In comparison to the illegal software used by older music piracy networks such as Napster or Limewire, current music streaming services such as Spotify and Rdio offer cheap yet legal access to copyrighted music by paying the rights holders through money made off of payments made by premium users and through advertisements\n\n"}

It is commonly known by its incipit \"¡Oh gloria inmarcesible!\" (), although this is not its official title. It is largely the creation of José Domingo Torres, an actor from Bogotá, who took a poem written by former Colombian president Rafael Núñez and asked a friend, opera singer Oreste Sindici, to set it to music.\n\nThe official announcement of the song came in the form of Act 33 of October 28, 1920. The law 198 of 1995, which legislates national symbols, its broadcast became mandatory for all radio and television in the country both at 6:00 am and at 6:00 pm (the latter half, at various times for private open signal and not applicable to national TV channels by cable), and public addresses of the President of the Republic and other official events.\n\nDuring the border conflict with Peru (1932–1934), the soldiers who defended Colombia's national sovereignty added a new verse after the trumpet fanfare. Written specifically for that time of war, it soon fell into disuse. The words are:\n\nAccording to José Antonio Amaya, elementary school students in the 1930s were taught this stanza.\n\nThe final line is very similar to a line in the national anthem of Cuba that goes, \"¡Que morir por la patria es vivir!\"\n\nThe anthem should be played chorus-verse-chorus. Although the first verse is usually sung between choruses, any of the eleven verses may be used. The anthem should be played chorus-verse-chorus regardless of which verse is selected. This is how it is customarily performed in all public, political, and other important events both public and private.\n\nHowever, it is not uncommon for only the chorus and verse to be played without repeating the chorus. This is usually the case when brevity is sought. By law, radio and television broadcasts must play the national anthem at 6:00 am and 6:00 pm, and the radio invariably uses the shorter format.

{"id": "7743915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7743915", "title": "Need for cognition", "text": "Need for cognition\n\nThe need for cognition (NFC), in psychology, is a personality variable reflecting the extent to which individuals are inclined towards effortful cognitive activities.\n\nNeed for cognition has been variously defined as \"a need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways\" and \"a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world\". Higher NFC is associated with increased appreciation of debate, idea evaluation, and problem solving. Those with a high need for cognition may be inclined towards high elaboration. Those with a lower need for cognition may display opposite tendencies, and may process information more heuristically, often through low elaboration.\n\nNeed for cognition is closely related to the five factor model domain openness to experience, typical intellectual engagement, and epistemic curiosity (see below).\n\nCohen, Stotland and Wolfe (1955), in their work on individual differences in cognitive motivation, identified a \"need for cognition\" which they defined as \"the individual's need to organize his experience meaningfully\", the \"need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways\", and \"need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world\" (p. 291). They argued that, if this \"need\" were frustrated, it would generate \"feelings of tension and deprivation\" that would instigate \"active efforts to structure the situation and increase understanding\" (p. 291), though the particular situations arousing and satisfying the need may vary (p. 291). Cohen argued that even in structured situations, people high in NFC see ambiguity and strive for higher standards of cognitive clarity.\n\nCohen and colleagues themselves identified multiple prior identifications of need for cognition, citing works by Murphy, Maslow, Katz, Harlow and Asch They distinguished their concept from the apparently similar \"intolerance of ambiguity\" proposed by Frenkel-Brunswik, arguing that NFC does not reflect the need to experience an integrated and meaningful world. Contemporary research suggests that Cohen's conception of need is, however, closer to tolerance of ambiguity, need for structure, or need for cognitive closure than to current ideas of need for cognition. For instance, studies using Cohen's measures indicated avoidance of ambiguity and a need to get \"meaning\" even if this meant relying on heuristics or expert advice rather than careful scrutiny of incoming information.\n\nBuilding on this work, Cacioppo therefore moved away from drive-reduction toward measuring individual differences in the self-reward potential of cognitive activity, stressing (p. 118) that they were using the word need in the statistical sense of a \"likelihood or tendency\", rather than in the rudimentary biological sense of \"tissue deprivation\", they defined the need for cognition as an individual's tendency to \"engage in and enjoy thinking\" (p. 116) and the tendency to \"organize, abstract, and evaluate information\" (p. 124)—or, variously, as a stable, but individually different \"tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive endeavors\", or an \"intrinsic motivation to engage in effortful cognitive endeavors... and exercise their mental faculties\", or an \"intrinsic motivation for effortful thought\".\n\nCacioppo and Petty (1982) created their own 34-item scale to measure the need for cognition. Two years later, an 18-item version was published and in most of the cases reported in the subsequent literature it is this amended scale that is administered. Recently, a 6-item version of the need for cognition scale was proposed.\n\nPeople high in the need for cognition are more likely to form their attitudes by paying close attention to relevant arguments (i.e., via the central route to persuasion), whereas people low in the need for cognition are more likely to rely on peripheral cues, such as how attractive or credible a speaker is. People low in need for cognition are also more likely to rely on stereotypes alone in judging other people than those high in need for cognition.\n\nPsychological research on the need for cognition has been conducted using self-report tests, where research participants answered a series of statements such as \"I prefer my life to be filled with puzzles that I must solve\" and were scored on how much they felt the statements represented them. The results have suggested that people who are high in the need for cognition scale score slightly higher in verbal intelligence tests but no higher in abstract reasoning tests.\n\nResearch has concluded that individuals high in NFC are less likely to attribute higher social desirability to more attractive individuals or to mates. College students high in NFC report higher life satisfaction.\n\nA study on lucid dreaming found that frequent and occasional lucid dreamers scored higher on NFC than non-lucid dreamers. This suggests there is continuity between waking and dreaming cognitive styles. Researchers have argued that this is because self-reflectiveness or self-focused attention is heightened in lucid dreams and also is associated with greater need for cognition.\n\nA number of studies have found moderate correlations between NFC and measures of verbal intelligence. One study found that need for cognition had a moderate positive correlation with fluid intelligence (reasoning ability, particularly verbal, and to a lesser extent numeric and figural reasoning), and a weaker correlation with crystallised intelligence (knowledge), which had much smaller positive correlations.\n\nNFC has been incorporated into Epstein's dual-system theory of personality called cognitive-experiential self-theory. The theory proposes that people have two information processing systems, a rational system and an experiential system. The rational system is thought to be logical, verbal and relatively unemotional. The experiential system is thought to be intuitive, based on images and highly reliant on emotion. A modified version of the Need for Cognition scale has been used to assess individual differences in the rational system, whereas the experiential system has been assessed using a scale called Faith in Intuition.\n\nResearch shows that the two system are uncorrelated and hence independent of each other. That is individuals either high or low in need for cognition may also make use of their intuitions in forming judgments. In fact, individuals high and low in need for cognition respectively may make use of their intuitions in differing ways. When individuals give little thought to their judgments these judgments may be influenced directly by emotions, intuitions, and images in an automatic way. On the other hand, those who are high in need for cognition tend to give more thought to their judgments, and the thoughts generated may be indirectly biased by their emotions, intuitions, and images. Hence individuals high in need for cognition are not necessarily more \"rational\" than those low in this trait, if their faith in intuition is also high. Rather, their \"irrational\" intuitions tend to be given more thoughtful elaboration than those who are low in need for cognition and yet also high in faith in intuition.\n\nNFC is associated with the amount of thought that goes into making a decision. Both high and low levels of the trait may be associated with particular biases in judgment. People low in need for cognition tend to show more bias when this bias is due to relying on mental shortcuts, that is, heuristic biases. People high in this trait tend to be more affected by biases that are generated by effortful thought.\n\nHigh need for cognition is associated with a greater susceptibility to the creation of false memories associated with certain learning tasks. In a commonly used research paradigm, participants are asked to memorise a list of related words. Recognition is tested by having them pick out learned words from a set of studied and non-studied items. Certain non-studied items are conceptually related to studied items (e.g., \"chair\" if the original list contained \"table\" and \"legs\"). People high in NFC are more likely to show false memory for these lures, due to their greater elaboration of learned items in memory as they are more likely to think of semantically related (but non-studied) items.\n\nA bias associated with low need for cognition is the halo effect, a phenomenon in which attractive or likeable people tend to be rated as superior on a variety of other characteristics (e.g., intelligence). People low on NFC are more likely to rely on stereotypes rather than individual features of a person when rating a novel target. People high in NFC still show a halo effect however, albeit a smaller one, perhaps because their thoughts about the target are still biased by the target's attractiveness.\n\nNFC has been found to be strongly associated with a number of independently developed constructs, specifically epistemic curiosity, typical intellectual engagement, and openness to ideas.\n\n\nResearch has shown that high-need for cognition consumers prefer advertising that features open-ended comparative advertising which allows consumers to decide which brand is best.\n\nNFC has also offered insights into how people respond to alternative web site designs. Martin, Sherrard and Wentzel (2005) demonstrate that high-need for cognition people prefer web sites with high verbal complexity (more in-depth information) and low visual complexity (static images rather than animations).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2476580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2476580", "title": "Persian phonology", "text": "Persian phonology\n\nThe Persian language has six vowel phonemes and twenty-three consonant phonemes. It features contrastive stress and syllable-final consonant clusters.\n\n The chart to the right reflects the vowels of many educated Persian speakers from Tehran.\n\nThe three vowels , and are traditionally referred to as 'short' vowels and the other three (, and ) as 'long' vowels. In fact the three 'short' vowels are short only when in an open syllable (i.e. a syllable ending in a vowel) that is non-final (but can be unstressed or stressed), e.g. 'sound', 'God'. In a closed syllable (i.e. a syllable ending in a consonant) that is unstressed, they are around sixty percent as long as a long vowel; this is true for the 'long' vowel as well. Otherwise the 'short' and 'long' vowels are all pronounced long. Example: 'firmer'.\n\nWhen the short vowels are in open syllables, they are also unstable and tend in informal styles to assimilate in quality to the following long vowel. Thus 'two hundred' becomes , 'crowded' becomes , 'to arrive' becomes and so on.\n\nWord-final is rare except for ('you' [singular]), loanwords (mostly of Arabic origin), and proper and common nouns of foreign origin, and word-final is very rare in Iranian Persian, an exception being ('no'). The word-final in Early New Persian mostly shifted to in contemporary Iranian Persian (often romanized as , meaning is also an allophone of in word-final position in contemporary Iranian Persian), but is preserved in the Eastern dialects.\n\nThe status of diphthongs in Persian is disputed. Some authors list , others list only and , but some do not recognize diphthongs in Persian at all. A major factor that complicates the matter is the change of two classical and pre-classical Persian diphthongs: and . This shift occurred in Iran but not in some modern varieties (particularly of Afghanistan). Morphological analysis also supports the view that the alleged Persian diphthongs are combinations of the vowels with and .\n\nThe Persian orthography does not distinguish between the diphthongs and the consonants and ; that is, they both are written with and respectively.\n\nFor Western Persian:\n\nThe variety of Afghanistan has also preserved these two Classic Persian vowels:\nIn the modern Persian alphabet, the short vowels , , are usually left unwritten, as is normally done in Arabic alphabet. (See .)\n\nEarly New Persian inherited from Middle Persian eight vowels: three short \"i, a, u\" and five long \"ī, ē, ā, ō, ū\" (in IPA: and ). It is likely that this system passed into the common Persian era from a purely quantitative system into one where the short vowels differed from their long counterparts also in quality: \"i\" > ; \"u\" > ; \"ā\" > . These quality contrasts have in modern Persian varieties become the main distinction between the two sets of vowels.\n\nThe inherited eight-vowel inventory is retained without major upheaval in Dari, which also preserves quantitative distinctions.\n\nIn Western Persian, two of the vowel contrasts have been lost: those between the tense mid and close vowels. Thus \"ē\", \"ī\" have merged as , while \"ō\", \"ū\" have merged as . In addition, the lax close vowels have been lowered: \"i\" > , \"u\" > . The lax open vowel has become fronted: \"a\" > , and in word-final position further raised to . Modern Iranian Persian does not feature distinctive vowel length.\n\nIn both varieties \"ā\" is more or less labialized, as well as raised in Dari. Dari \"ō\" is also somewhat fronted.\n\nTajiki has also lost two of the vowel contrasts, but differently from Western Persian: here the tense/lax contrast among the close vowels has been eliminated. That is, \"i\", \"ī\" have merged as , and \"u\", \"ū\" have merged as . The other tense back vowels have shifted as well. Mid \"ō\" has shifted front: or , a vowel usually romanized as \"ů\". Open \"ā\" has been labialized and raised to an open-mid vowel .\n\nLoanwords from Arabic generally undergo these changes as well.\n\nThe following chart summarizes the later shifts into modern Tajik, Dari, and Western Persian.\n\nNotes:\n\n\nAlveolar stops and are either apical alveolar or laminal denti-alveolar. The voiceless obstruents are aspirated much like their English counterparts: they become aspirated when they begin a syllable, though aspiration is not contrastive. The Persian language does not have syllable-initial consonant clusters (see below), so unlike in English, are aspirated even following , as in ('I exist'). They are also aspirated at the end of syllables, although not as strongly.\n\nThe velar stops are palatalized before front vowels or at the end of a syllable.\n\nIn Classical Persian, the uvular consonants and denoted the original Arabic phonemes, the fricative and the plosive , respectively. In modern Tehrani Persian (which is used in the Iranian mass media, both colloquial and standard), there is no difference in the pronunciation of and , and they are both normally pronounced as a voiced stop . The classic pronunciations of and are preserved in the eastern varieties, Dari and Tajiki, as well as in the southern varieties (e.g. Zoroastrian Dari language and other Central / Central Plateau or Kermanic languages).\n\nThe alveolar flap has a trilled allophonic variant at the beginning of a word (it is sometimes a free variation between a trill and a flap ); the trill as a separate phoneme occurs word-medially especially in loanwords of Arabic origin as a result of gemination of . An approximant also occurs as an allophone of before ; is sometimes in free variation with in these and other positions, such that ('Persian') is pronounced or and ('scarlet') or . is sometimes realized as a long approximant .\n\nThe velar nasal is an allophone of before \n\nThe pronunciation of in Classical Persian shifted to in Iranian Persian and Tajik, but is retained in Dari. In modern Persian may be lost if preceded by a consonant and followed by a vowel in one whole syllable, e.g. 'sleep', as Persian has no syllable-initial consonant clusters (see below).\n\nIn standard Iranian Persian, the consonants and are pronounced identically.\n\nConsonants can be geminated, often in words from Arabic. This is represented in the IPA either by doubling the consonant, , or with the length marker , .\n\nSyllables may be structured as (C)(S)V(S)(C(C)).\n\nPersian syllable structure consists of an optional syllable onset, consisting of one consonant; an obligatory syllable nucleus, consisting of a vowel optionally preceded by and/or followed by a semivowel; and an optional syllable coda, consisting of one or two consonants. The following restrictions apply:\n\nThe Persian word-accent has been described as a stress accent by some, and as a pitch accent by others. In fact the accented syllables in Persian are generally pronounced with a raised pitch as well as stress; but in certain contexts words may become deaccented and lose their high pitch.\n\nFrom an intonational point of view, Persian words (or accentual phrases) usually have the intonation (L +) H* (where L is low and H* is a high-toned stressed syllable), e.g. 'book'; unless there is a suffix, in which case the intonation is (L +) H* + L, e.g. 'my book'. The last accent of a sentence is usually accompanied by a low boundary tone, which produces a falling pitch on the last accented syllable, e.g. 'it was a book'.\n\nWhen two words are joined in an \"ezafe\" construction, they can either be pronounced accentually as two separate words, e.g. 'the people (of) here', or else the first word loses its high tone and the two words are pronounced as a single accentual phrase: . Words also become deaccented following a focused word; for example, in the sentence 'it was my mom's letter on the table' all the syllables following the word 'mom' are pronounced with a low pitch.\n\nKnowing the rules for the correct placement of the accent is essential for proper pronunciation.\n\n\nWhen spoken formally, Iranian Persian is pronounced as written. But colloquial pronunciation as used by all classes makes a number of very common substitutions. Note that Iranians can interchange colloquial and formal sociolects in conversational speech.

In 1988, scientists at three separate laboratories dated samples from the Shroud to a range of 1260–1390 AD, which coincides with the first certain appearance of the shroud in the 1350s and is much later than the burial of Jesus in 30 or 33 AD. Aspects of the 1988 test continue to be debated. Despite some technical concerns that have been raised about radiocarbon dating of the Shroud, no radiocarbon-dating expert has asserted that the dating is unreliable.\n\nThe idea of scientifically dating the shroud had first been proposed in the 1960s, but permission had been refused because the procedure at the time would have required the destruction of too much fabric (almost 0.05 sq m ≅ 0.538 sq ft). The development in the 1970s of new techniques for radio-carbon dating, which required much lower quantities of source material, prompted the Catholic Church to found the \"Shroud of Turin Research Project\" (S.Tu.R.P.), which involved about 30 scientists of various religious faiths, including non-Christians.\n\nThe S.Tu.R.P. group initially planned to conduct a range of different studies on the cloth, including radio-carbon dating. A commission headed by chemist Robert H. Dinegar and physicist Harry E. Gove consulted numerous laboratories which were able at the time (1982) to carbon-date small fabric samples. The six labs that showed interest in performing the procedure fell into two categories, according to the method they utilised:\nTo obtain independent and replicable results, and to avoid conflict between the laboratories, it was decided to let all interested laboratories perform the tests at the same time.\n\nIn 1982, the S.Tu.R.P. group published the list of tests to be performed on the shroud; these aimed to identify how the image was impressed onto the cloth, to verify the relic's purported origin, and to identify better-suited conservation methods. However, a disagreement between the S.Tu.R.P. group and the candidate laboratories turned into a P.R. rift: the S.Tu.R.P. group expected to perform the radiometric examination under its own aegis and after the other examinations had been completed, while the laboratories considered radio-carbon dating to be the prime test, which should be completed at the detriment of other tests, if necessary.\n\nA meeting with ecclesiastic authorities took place on September 29, 1986, to determine the way forward. In the end, a compromise solution was reached with the so-called \"Turin protocol\", which stated that:\n\nThe Vatican subsequently decided to adopt a different protocol instead.\nThese deviations were heavily criticized.\n\nThe blind-test method was abandoned, because the distinctive three-to-one herringbone twill weave of the shroud could not be matched in the controls, and it was therefore still possible for a laboratory to identify the shroud sample. Shredding the samples would not solve the problem, while making it much more difficult and wasteful to clean the samples properly. Professor Harry Gove, director of Rochester's laboratory (one of the four not selected by the Vatican), argued in an open letter published in \"Nature\" that discarding the blind-test method would expose the results – whatever they may be – to suspicion of unreliability. However, in a 1990 paper Gove conceded that the \"arguments often raised, … that radiocarbon measurements on the shroud should be performed blind seem to the author to be lacking in merit; … lack of blindness in the measurements is a rather insubstantial reason for disbelieving the result.\"\n\nIn the heated debate that followed, a Church's spokesperson declared that \n\nThe proposed changes to the Turin protocol sparked another heated debate among scientists, and the sampling procedure was postponed.\n\nOn April 17, 1988, ten years after the S.Tu.R.P. project had been initiated, British Museum scientific director Michael Tite published in Nature the \"final\" protocol:\n\nAmong the most obvious differences between the final version of the protocol and the previous ones stands the decision to sample from a single location on the cloth. This is significant because, should the chosen portion be in any way not representative of the remainder of the shroud, the results would only be applicable to that portion of the cloth.\n\nA further, relevant difference was the deletion of the blind test, considered by some scholars as the very foundation of the scientific method. The blind-test method was abandoned because the distinctive three-to-one herringbone twill weave of the shroud could not be matched in the controls, and a laboratory could thus identify the shroud sample. Shredding the samples would not solve the problem, while making it much more difficult and wasteful to clean the samples properly.\n\nSamples were taken on April 21, 1988, in the Cathedral by Franco Testore, an expert on weaves and fabrics, and by Giovanni Riggi, a representative of the maker of bio-equipment \"Numana\". Testore performed the weighting operations while Riggi made the actual cut. Also present were Cardinal Ballestrero, four priests, archdiocese spokesperson Luigi Gonella, photographers, a camera operator, Michael Tite of the British Museum, and the labs' representatives.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, a piece twice as big as the one required by the protocol was cut from the Shroud; it measured . An outer strip showing coloured filaments of uncertain origin was discarded. The remaining sample, measuring and weighing 300 mg, was first divided in two equal parts, one of which was preserved in a sealed container, in the custody of the Vatican, in case of future need. The other half was cut into three segments, and packaged for the labs in a separate room by Dr Tite and the archbishop. The lab representatives were not present at this packaging process, in accordance with the protocol.\n\nThe labs were also each given three control samples (one more than originally intended), that were:\n\nTucson performed the tests in May, Zürich in June, and Oxford in August, and communicated their results to the British Museum.\n\nOn September 28, 1988, British Museum director and coordinator of the study Michael Tite communicated the official results to the Diocese of Turin and to the Holy See.\n\nIn a well-attended press conference on October 13, Cardinal Ballestrero announced the official results, i.e. that radio-carbon testing dated the shroud to a date of 1260-1390 AD, with 95% confidence. The official and complete report on the experiment was published in \"Nature\". The uncalibrated dates from the individual laboratories, with 1-sigma errors (68% confidence), were as follows:\nAs reported in \"Nature\", Professor Bray of the Instituto di Metrologia 'G. Colonetti', Turin, \"confirmed that the results of the three laboratories were mutually compatible, and that, on the evidence submitted, none of the mean results was questionable.\"\n\nAlthough the quality of the radiocarbon testing itself is unquestioned, criticisms have been raised regarding the choice of the sample taken for testing, with suggestions that the sample may represent a medieval repair fragment rather than the image-bearing cloth. It is hypothesised that the sampled area was a medieval repair which was conducted by \"invisible reweaving\". Since the C14 dating at least four articles have been published in scholarly sources contending that the samples used for the dating test may not have been representative of the whole shroud.\n\nThese included an article by American chemist Raymond Rogers, who conducted chemical analysis for the Shroud of Turin Research Project and who was involved in work with the Shroud since the STURP project began in 1978. Rogers took 32 documented adhesive-tape samples from all areas of the shroud and associated textiles during the STURP process in 1978. He received 14 yarn segments from Prof. Luigi Gonella (from the Department of Physics, at the Polytechnic University of Turin) on 14 October 1979, which Gonellla told him were from the Raes sample. On 12 December 2003, Rogers received samples of both warp and weft threads that Prof. Luigi Gonella claimed to have taken from the radiocarbon sample before it was distributed for dating. The actual provenance of these threads is uncertain, as Gonella was not authorized to take or retain genuine shroud material, but Gonella told Rogers that he excised the threads from the center of the radiocarbon sample.\n\nRaymond Rogers stated in a 2005 article that he performed chemical analyses on these undocumented threads, and compared them to the undocumented Raes threads as well as the samples he had kept from his STURP work. He stated that his analysis showed: \"The radiocarbon sample contains both a gum/dye/mordant coating and cotton fibers. The main part of the shroud does not contain these materials.\" He speculated that these products may have been used by medieval weavers to match the colour of the original weave when performing repairs and backing the shroud for additional protection. Based on this comparison Rogers concluded that the undocumented threads received from Gonella did not match the main body of the shroud, and that in his opinion: \"The worst possible sample for carbon dating was taken.\"\n\nAs part of the testing process in 1988, Derbyshire laboratory in the UK assisted the Oxford University radiocarbon acceleration unit by identifying foreign material removed from the samples before they were processed. Professor Edward Hall of the Oxford team noticed two or three \"minute\" fibers which looked \"out of place\", and those \"minute\" fibers were identified as cotton by Peter South (textile expert of the Derbyshire laboratory) who said: \"It may have been used for repairs at some time in the past, or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven. It may not have taken us long to identify the strange material, but it was unique amongst the many and varied jobs we undertake.” \n\nThe official report of the dating process, written by the people who performed the sampling, states that the sample \"came from a single site on the main body of the shroud away from any patches or charred areas.\"\n\nMechthild Flury-Lemberg is an expert in the restoration of textiles, who headed the restoration and conservation of the Turin Shroud in 2002. She has rejected the theory of the \"invisible reweaving\", pointing out that it would be technically impossible to perform such a repair without leaving traces, and that she found no such traces in her study of the shroud.\n\nProfessor Harry E. Gove, former professor emeritus of physics at the University of Rochester and former director of the Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory at the University of Rochester, helped to invent radiocarbon dating and was closely involved in setting up the shroud dating project. He also attended the actual dating process at the University of Arizona. Gove has written (in the respected scientific journal Radiocarbon) that: \"Another argument has been made that the part of the shroud from which the sample was cut had possibly become worn and threadbare from countless handlings and had been subjected to medieval textile restoration. If so, the restoration would have had to be done with such incredible virtuosity as to render it microscopically indistinguishable from the real thing. Even modern so-called invisible weaving can readily be detected under a microscope, so this possibility seems unlikely. It seems very convincing that what was measured in the laboratories was genuine cloth from the shroud after it had been subjected to rigorous cleaning procedures. Probably no sample for carbon dating has ever been subjected to such scrupulously careful examination and treatment, nor perhaps ever will again.\"\n\nIn 2010, professors of statistics Marco Riani and Anthony C. Atkinson wrote in a scientific paper that the statistical analysis of the raw dates obtained from the three laboratories for the radiocarbon test suggests the presence of contamination in some of the samples. They conclude that: \"The effect is not large over the sampled region; … our estimate of the change is about two centuries.\"\n\nIn December 2010, Professor Timothy Jull, a member of the original 1988 radiocarbon-dating team and editor of the peer-reviewed journal \"Radiocarbon\", coauthored an article in that journal with Rachel A Freer-Waters. They examined a portion of the radiocarbon sample that was left over from the section used by the University of Arizona in 1988 for the carbon dating exercise, and were assisted by the director of the Gloria F Ross Center for Tapestry Studies. They viewed the fragment using a low magnification (~30×) stereomicroscope, as well as under high magnification (320×) viewed through both transmitted light and polarized light, and then with epifluorescence microscopy. They found \"only low levels of contamination by a few cotton fibers\" and no evidence that the samples actually used for measurements in the C14 dating processes were dyed, treated, or otherwise manipulated. They concluded that the radiocarbon dating had been performed on a sample of the original shroud material.\n\nIn March 2013, Giulio Fanti, professor of mechanical and thermal measurement at the University of Padua, conducted a battery of experiments on various threads that he believes were cut from the shroud during the 1988 Carbon-14 dating, and concluded that they dated from 300 BC to 400 AD, potentially placing the Shroud within the lifetime of Jesus of Nazareth. Because of the manner in which Fanti obtained the shroud fibers, many are dubious about his findings. The shroud’s official custodian, Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia of Turin, told Vatican Insider: \"As there is no degree of safety on the authenticity of the materials on which these experiments were carried out [on] the shroud cloth, the shroud's custodians cannot recognize any serious value to the results of these alleged experiments.\" Barrie Schwortz, a member of the original STURP investigation team, commented on Fanti’s theory: \"But it would be more convincing if the basic research had first been presented in a professional, peer-reviewed journal. If you’re using old techniques in new ways, then you need to submit your approach to other scientists.\"\n\nRaymond Rogers argued in the scientific journal \"Thermochimica Acta\" that the presence of vanillin differed markedly between the unprovenanced threads he was looking at, which contained 37% of the original vanillin, while the body of the shroud contained 0% of the original vanillin. He stated that: \"The fact that vanillin cannot be detected in the lignin on shroud fibers, Dead Sea scrolls linen, and other very old linens indicate that the shroud is quite old. A determination of the kinetics of vanillin loss suggest the shroud is between 1300 and 3000 years old. Even allowing for errors in the measurements and assumptions about storage conditions, the cloth is unlikely to be as young as 840 years\".\n\nIt has been stated that Roger’s vanillin-dating process is untested, and the validity thereof is suspect, as the deterioration of vanillin is heavily influenced by the temperature of its environment – heat strips away vanillin rapidly, and the shroud has been subjected to temperatures high enough to melt silver and scorch the cloth. Rogers' analysis is also questioned by skeptics such as Joe Nickell, who reasons that the conclusions of the author, Raymond Rogers, result from \"starting with the desired conclusion and working backward to the evidence\".\n\nPictorial evidence dating from c. 1690 and 1842 indicates that the corner used for the dating and several similar evenly spaced areas along one edge of the cloth were handled each time the cloth was displayed, the traditional method being for it to be held suspended by a row of five bishops. Others contend that repeated handling of this kind greatly increased the likelihood of contamination by bacteria and bacterial residue compared to the newly discovered archaeological specimens for which carbon-14 dating was developed. Bacteria and associated residue (bacteria by-products and dead bacteria) carry additional carbon-14 that would skew the radiocarbon date toward the present.\n\nRodger Sparks, a radiocarbon expert from New Zealand, had countered that an error of thirteen centuries stemming from bacterial contamination in the Middle Ages would have required a layer approximately doubling the sample weight. Because such material could be easily detected, fibers from the shroud were examined at the National Science Foundation Mass Spectrometry Center of Excellence at the University of Nebraska. Pyrolysis-mass-spectrometry examination failed to detect any form of bioplastic polymer on fibers from either non-image or image areas of the shroud. Additionally, laser-microprobe Raman analysis at Instruments SA, Inc. in Metuchen, New Jersey, also failed to detect any bioplastic polymer on shroud fibers.\n\nProfessor Harry Gove, director of Rochester's laboratory (one of the laboratories not selected to conduct the testing), once hypothesised that a \"bioplastic\" bacterial contamination, which was unknown during the 1988 testing, could have rendered the tests inaccurate. He has however also acknowledged that the samples had been carefully cleaned with strong chemicals before testing. He noted that different cleaning procedures were employed by and within the three laboratories, and that even if some slight contamination remained, about two thirds of the sample would need to consist of modern material to swing the result away from a 1st Century date to a Medieval date. He inspected the Arizona sample material before it was cleaned, and determined that no such gross amount of contamination was present even before the cleaning commenced.\n\nOthers have suggested that the silver of the molten reliquary and the water used to douse the flames may have catalysed the airborne carbon into the cloth. The Russian Dmitri Kouznetsov, an archaeological biologist and chemist, claimed in 1994 to have managed to experimentally reproduce this purported enrichment of the cloth in ancient weaves, and published numerous articles on the subject between 1994 and 1996. Kouznetsov's results could not be replicated, and no actual experiments have been able to validate this theory, so far. Professor Gian Marco Rinaldi and others proved that Kouznetsov never performed the experiments described in his papers, citing non-existent fonts and sources, including the museums from which he claimed to have obtained the samples of ancient weaves on which he performed the experiments. Kouznetsov was arrested in 1997 on American soil under allegations of accepting bribes by magazine editors to produce manufactured evidence and false reports.\n\nJull, Donahue and Damon of the NSF Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometer Facility at the University of Arizona attempted to replicate the Kouznetsov experiment, and could find no evidence for the gross changes in age proposed by Kouznetsov et al. They concluded that the proposed carbon-enriching heat treatments were not capable of producing the claimed changes in the measured radiocarbon age of the linen, that the attacks by Kouznetsov et al. on the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the shroud \"in general are unsubstantiated and incorrect,\" and that the \"other aspects of the experiment are unverifiable and irreproducible.\"\n\nIn 2008 Dr John Jackson of the Turin Shroud Center of Colorado proposed a new hypothesis – namely the possibility of more recent enrichment if carbon monoxide were to slowly interact with a fabric so as to deposit its enriched carbon into the fabric, interpenetrating into the fibrils that make up the cloth. Jackson proposed to test if this were actually possible. Professor Christopher Ramsey, the director of the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, took the theory seriously and agreed to collaborate with Jackson in testing a series of linen samples that could determine if the case for the Shroud's authenticity should be re-opened. Before conducting the tests, he told the BBC that \"With the radiocarbon measurements and with all of the other evidence which we have about the Shroud, there does seem to be a conflict in the interpretation of the different evidence.\" Professor Ramsey stressed that he would be surprised if the results of the 1988 tests were shown to be far out – especially \"a thousand years wrong\" – but he insisted that he was keeping an open mind.\n\nThe results of the tests were to form part of a documentary on the Turin Shroud which was to be broadcast on BBC2. The producer of the 2008 documentary, David Rolfe, suggested that the quantity of carbon 14 found on the weave may have been significantly affected by the weather, the conservation methods employed throughout the centuries, as well as the volatile carbon generated by the fire that damaged the shroud while in Savoy custody at Chambéry. Other similar theories include that candle smoke (rich in carbon dioxide) and the volatile carbon molecules produced during the two fires may have altered the carbon content of the cloth, rendering carbon-dating unreliable as a dating tool.\n\nIn March 2008 Professor Ramsey reported back on the testing that: \"So far the linen samples have been subjected to normal conditions (but with very high concentrations of carbon monoxide). These initial tests show no significant reaction – even though the sensitivity of the measurements is sufficient to detect contamination that would offset the age by less than a single year. This is to be expected and essentially confirms why this sort of contamination has not been considered a serious issue before.\" He noted that carbon monoxide does not undergo significant reactions with linen which could result in an incorporation of a significant number of CO molecules into the cellulose structure. He also added that there is as yet no direct evidence to suggest the original radiocarbon dates are not accurate.\n\nIn 2011, Ramsey commented that in general \"there are various hypotheses as to why the dates might not be correct, but none of them stack up.\"\n\nIn 1994, J. A. Christen applied a strong statistical test to the radiocarbon data and concluded that the given age for the shroud is, from a statistical point of view, correct.\n\nHowever critics claim to have identified statistical errors in the conclusions published in \"Nature\": including: the actual standard deviation for the Tucson study was 17 years, not 31, as published; the chi-square distribution value is 8.6 rather than 6.4, and the relative significance level (which measures the reliability of the results) is close to 1% – rather than the published 5%, which is the minimum acceptable threshold.\n\n"}

Another possibility is that a powerful wizard returns a dead hero from the past to make him go on a quest that no living human would dare to undertake. Such a revenant may be just as intelligent as it was in life but its will is usually bound by the wizard who summons and controls it.\n\nMerriam-Webster's definition of revenant is \"one that returns after death or a long absence.\" In that the subject returns from death, one can easily see an association of the term with the undead in fantasy and horror fiction. On the other hand, unlike zombies, the revenant's \"long absence\" does imply a certain anachronism in its eventual return.\nThe term often implies some underlying motive of revenge prompting the return.\n\nRevenants exist primarily in role-playing games, fantasy fiction, science fiction, and horror fiction.\n\n\n\n"}

It is endorsed by the Oriental Institute in Sarajevo. The aim of the festival is the creation of inter-religious dialogue and the promotion of peace, reconciliation and solidarity among faith groups through the presentation of Islamic art and culture. \n\nThe festival lasts for the length of Ramadan and is composed of numerous programmes that are held all over the city. Open-air Iftar, the evening meal with which Muslims end their daily Ramadan fast at sunset, open to Muslims and non-Muslims alike, is organized every evening in the Žuta Tabija fortress that overlooks the city. Exhibitions of Islamic art, including calligrophy, paintings, pottery and marquetry are held in the Gazi Husrev-beg Library which also hosts readings of renowned Islamic poetry. A trade fair of book publishers on Islamic art is another of the numerous festival programmes. Interactive lectures, pannel discussions and Q&A's on Islamic theology, culture and art are held in the Gazi Husrev-beg Library and the Gazi Husrev-beg Madrasa. Lecturers and speakers have included Grand mufti Husein Kavazović, Islamic art historian Sabiha Al Khemir, German orientalist Stefan Weber and others. Concerts of different Islamic musical styles such as Nasheed, Dhikr or traditional Bosnian Sevdalinka are held in the Sarajevo National Theatre.

It is India's first asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge. The pylon of the Signature bridge is the tallest structure in Delhi and is double the height of Qutb Minar with its 154-metre high viewing box, which acts as selfie points for visitors. It shortens the travel time between north and northeast Delhi.\n\nIn 1997, 28 school students died in an accident on the narrow Wazirabad bridge. Since then, the Delhi government had plans to build another parallel wide bridge nearby to alleviate traffic congestions. By the end of 1998, the Delhi government finalised the draft plan for this bridge. The bridge was inaugurated on 4 November 2018 by the Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal with the aim to ease the burgeoning traffic congestion on the existing Wazirabad bridge.\n\nBy the end of 1998, the Delhi government finalized the draft plan made by Divyansh Sharma for the construction of the bridge. However, the construction of the bridge was stuck due to multiple reasons - lack of manpower and financial difficulties, being the major reason. When the project started, its cost was estimated to be ₹1,100 crore. Now it has surpassed ₹1,875 crores. The Delhi government was tight handed and it was very difficult for it to shell out the extra rising budget. ₹1,244 crores of rupees have been sanctioned recently through PBDB. The work had started in full swing in 2004 on the bridge. A fresh deadline of end 2016 was set in 2013. Since then half a dozen times, deadlines have been missed and fresh deadlines set. Finally, the bridge was inaugurated in November 2018.\n\nThe bridge is a Cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge, a type of Cable-stayed bridge and in which cables were in a combination of radial and semi-harp arrangement, in which cables are spaced apart on the pylon, like the harp design, but connect to one point or a number of closely spaced points on the deck. The dynamically shaped pylon consists of 2 inclined columns, which are rigidly connected to the driving lanes and bend mid-way. The upper portion of the pylon anchors the back-stay cables as well as the main-span cables and the self-weight of the pylon balances out the self-weight of the super structure through the eccentric location of its center of gravity with respect to the pivot point of the pylon footing, reducing the load on back-stay cables which are fewer in numbers converged from the main-span cables. The bridge is 675 meters long and 35.2 meters wide. Built on the Yamuna river, this bridge connects east Delhi to Wazirabad. When the bridge will be opened for general public, the traffic pressure on the narrow and dilapidated old Wazirabad Bridge will ease out significantly. Just like the Eiffel Tower in France, Signature Bridge will also have the facility to transport tourists on top of the main pillar, which is 154 m high, from where distant views of North Delhi can be seen.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22834191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22834191", "title": "TV Tropes", "text": "TV Tropes\n\nTV Tropes is a wiki that collects and expands descriptions and examples of various plot conventions and plot devices, more commonly known as tropes, that are found within many creative works. Since its establishment in 2004, the site has shifted focus from covering only television and film tropes to covering those in other types of media such as literature, comics, manga, video games, music, advertisements, and toys. The nature of the site as a provider of commentary on pop culture and fiction has attracted attention and criticism from several web personalities and blogs.\nThe content of the site was published as free content from April 2008. TV Tropes changed its license in July 2012 to allow only noncommercial distribution of its content while continuing to host the prior submissions under the new license.\n\nTV Tropes was founded in 2004 by a programmer under the pseudonym \"Fast Eddie\", who described himself as having become interested in the conventions of genre fiction while studying at MIT in the 1970s and after browsing Internet forums in the 1990s. As of 2018 the site is privately owned and the site publicly lists two co-owners besides Eddie.\n\nInitially focused on the television show \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", TV Tropes has since increased its scope to include television series, films, novels, plays, professional wrestling, video games, anime, manga, comic strips/books, fan fiction, and many other subjects, including Internet works such as Wikipedia (referred to in-wiki as \"The Other Wiki\"). Additionally, articles on the site often relate to real life, or point out real situations where certain tropes can be applied. It has also used its informal style to describe topics such as science, philosophy, politics, and history under its Useful Notes section. TV Tropes does not have notability standards for the works it covers.\n\nThe site includes entries on various series and tropes. An article on a work includes a brief summary of the work in question along with a list of associated tropes. Trope pages are the reverse of articles on works: they give a description of the trope itself, then provide a list of the trope's appearances in various works of media. In this way TV Tropes is fully interconnected through the various connections made between the works and their tropes.\n\nFor example, the trope \"I Am Spartacus\" is a specific type of scene that appears in multiple works. It refers to scenes where a character is shielded from identification by other characters who are also claiming to be that particular character. The trope name references a famous scene in the film \"Spartacus\". This example is included, along with examples from \"South Park\", \"Power Rangers in Space\", the Talmud and even recent stories from real life. Not all examples of a trope may be cases where it is \"played straight\". They may also include cases where the trope is parodied, played with, inverted or even averted (i.e. avoided altogether in a context where it would be expected).\n\nIn addition to the tropes, most articles about a work also have a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" (YMMV) page with items that are deemed to be subjective. These items are not usually storytelling tropes, but are audience reactions which have been defined and titled. For example, the page of the well known trope \"jumping the shark\", the moment at which a series experiences a sharp decline in quality as in the notorious story point in \"Happy Days\", only contains a list of works that reference the phrase. TV Tropes does not apply the term to a show, that being a subjective opinion about the show, but cites uses of the phrase by the show (\"in-universe\"). Most articles also have various pages within them. For example, the article may have an \"Awesome\" page to describe crowning moments of awesome (i.e., a moment in a show or other fictional work that the majority of the readers or viewers regard as one of the high points); a \"Fridge\" page which describes examples of the tropes \"Fridge Logic\" (issues of a given work's internal consistency that do not typically occur to one until later), as well as the related \"Fridge Horror\" and \"Fridge Brilliance\"; a \"Laconic\" page which describes an article/trope in a few short words; and more pages that focus on a particular aspect of an article/item.\n\nTrope description pages are generally created through a standardized launching system, known as the \"Trope Launch Pad\" (TLP, formerly \"You Know That Thing Where\" [YKTTW]); site members, (referred to as \"Tropers\"), can draft a trope description and have the option of providing examples or suggesting refinements to other drafts before launch. While going through TLP is not necessary to launch a trope, it is strongly recommended in order to strengthen the trope as much as possible.\n\nThe site has created its own self-referencing meta-trope, known as \"TV Tropes Will Ruin Your Life\". The trope warns that some readers may become jaded and cynical as an unanticipated side effect of reading TV Tropes, \"[replacing] surprise almost entirely with recognition,\" referring to the inability to read books, watch films, etc. without identifying each trope as it occurs. Also mentioned is that many frequently-contributing community members self-describe themselves as addicted to the site. The community has dubbed the pattern of many tropers as taking a \"Wiki Walk,\" starting an edit on an intended article, and subsequently following links from one page to the next for hours on end without intending to, pausing occasionally to add examples the troper notices to the listings or rework articles. In the process, this leads to the discovery of entirely new tropes to analyze, edit, and add examples to. This self-perpetuating cycle of behavior has become the subject of much lampooning for the community, with tongue-in-cheek references being made in the articles for tropes such as \"Brainwashing,\" \"Hive Mind,\" and \"Tome of Eldritch Lore\" (a book of cursed knowledge which infects the reader with obsessive madness).\n\nConsiderable redesign of some aspects of content organization occurred in 2008, such as the introduction of namespaces, while 2009 saw the arrival of other languages, German being the most developed. In 2011, TV Tropes branched out into video production, and launched \"Echo Chamber\", a web series about a TV Tropes vlogger explaining and demonstrating tropes.\n\nIn an interview with TV Tropes co-founder Fast Eddie, Gawker Media's blog \"io9\" described the tone of contributions to the site as \"often light and funny\". Cyberpunk author Bruce Sterling once described its style as a \"wry fanfic analysis\". Essayist Linda Börzsei described TV Tropes as a technological continuum of classical archetypal literary criticisms, capable of deconstructing recurring elements from creative works in an ironic fashion. Economist Robin Hanson, inspired by a scholarly analysis of Victorian literature, suggests TV Tropes offers a veritable treasure trove of information about fiction - a prime opportunity for research into its nature. In Lifehacker, Nick Douglas compared TV Tropes to Wikipedia, recommending to \"use [TV Tropes] when Wikipedia feels impenetrable, when you want opinions more than facts, or when you've finished a Wikipedia page and now you want the juicy parts, the hard-to-confirm bits that Wikipedia doesn't share.\"\n\nIn October 2010, in what the site refers to as \"The Google Incident\", Google temporarily withdrew its AdSense service from the site after determining that pages regarding adult and mature tropes were inconsistent with its terms of service. \n\nIn a separate incident in 2012, in response to other complaints by Google, TV Tropes changed its guidelines to restrict coverage of sexist tropes and rape tropes. Feminist blog \"The Mary Sue\" criticized this decision, as it censored documentation of sexist tropes in video games and young adult fiction. \"ThinkProgress\" additionally condemned Google AdSense itself for \"providing a financial disincentive to discuss\" such topics. The site now separates NSFG articles (Not Safe for Google) from SFG articles (Safe for Google) in order to allow discussion of these kinds of tropes.\n\nTV Tropes content was licensed since April 2008 with the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike (CC-BY-SA) license for free content. In July 2012, the site changed its license notice and its existing content to the incompatible Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike version (CC-BY-NC-SA). In November 2013, TV Tropes added a clause to their Terms of Use requiring all contributors to grant the site irrevocable, exclusive ownership of their contributions. In March 2015 this clause was removed, replaced with an assertion that TV Tropes does not claim ownership of user generated content. The site license also states that it is not required to attribute user content to its authors, although the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license requires attribution of the original author.\n\nRegarding these and other concerns of re-licensing and advertising, a wiki called All The Tropes forked all the content from TV Tropes with the original CC-BY-SA license in late 2013. Authors of the fork attributed several actions of taking commercial rights over what is published on its website, censorship, and failing to comply with the original license to TV Tropes managers. Some editors raised concerns that keeping the content submitted with the previous copyleft license at TV Tropes is illegal, as the re-licensing had occurred without the permission of the editors and the original CC-BY-SA license did not allow its distribution under the new terms.\n\n"}

{"id": "1659294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1659294", "title": "Teach the Controversy", "text": "Teach the Controversy\n\n\"Teach the Controversy\" is a campaign, conducted by the Discovery Institute, to promote the pseudoscientific principle of intelligent design, a variant of traditional creationism, while attempting to discredit the teaching of evolution in United States public high school science courses. The campaign claims that fairness and equal time require educating students with a 'critical analysis of evolution' where \"the full range of scientific views\", evolution's \"unresolved issues\", and the \"scientific weaknesses of evolutionary theory\" will be presented and evaluated alongside intelligent design concepts like irreducible complexity presented as a scientific argument against evolution through oblique references to books by design proponents listed in the bibliography of the Institute-proposed \"Critical Analysis of Evolution\" lesson plans.\n\nThe intelligent design movement and the Teach the Controversy campaign are directed and supported largely by the Discovery Institute, a conservative Christian think tank based in Seattle, Washington. The overall goals of the movement were stated as \"to defeat scientific materialism\" and \"to replace [it] with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.\"\n\nThe scientific community and science education organizations have replied that there is no scientific controversy regarding the validity of evolution and that the controversy exists solely in terms of religion and politics. A federal court, along with the majority of scientific organizations, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, say the Institute has manufactured the controversy they want to teach by promoting a \"false perception\" that evolution is \"a theory in crisis\" by falsely claiming it is the subject of wide controversy and debate within the scientific community. McGill University Professor Brian Alters, an expert in the creation-evolution controversy, is quoted in an article published by the NIH as stating that \"99.9 percent of scientists accept evolution\", whereas intelligent design has been rejected by the overwhelming majority of the scientific community. In the December 2005 ruling of \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", Judge John E. Jones III concluded that intelligent design is not science and \"cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents\". The \"Dover\" ruling also characterized \"teaching the controversy\" as part of a religious ploy.\n\nThe term \"teach the controversy\" originated with Gerald Graff, a professor of English and education at the University of Illinois at Chicago, as an admonition to teach that established knowledge is not simply given as a settled matter, but that it is created in a crucible of debate and controversy. To the chagrin of Graff, who describes himself as a liberal secularist, the idea was later appropriated by Phillip E. Johnson, Discovery Institute program advisor and father of the ID movement. Discussing the 1999-2000 Kansas State Board of Education controversy over the teaching of intelligent design in public school classrooms, Johnson wrote \"What educators in Kansas and elsewhere should be doing is to 'teach the controversy'.\" In his book Johnson proposed casting the conflicting points of view and agendas as a scholarly controversy. Johnson's usage differs somewhat from Graff's original concept. While Graff advocated that a comprehensive understanding of what are considered to be \"established\" concepts must include teaching the debates and conflicts by which they were established, Johnson appropriated the phrase to cast doubt upon the very concept of established knowledge.\n\nThe phrase was picked up by other Discovery Institute affiliates Stephen C. Meyer, David K. DeWolf, and Mark E. DeForrest in their 1999 article, \"Teaching the Controversy: Darwinism, Design and the Public School Science Curriculum\" published by the Foundation for Thought and Ethics. The Foundation for Thought and Ethics also publishes the controversial pro-intelligent design biology textbook \"Of Pandas and People\", suggested as an alternative to mainstream science and biology textbooks in the Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plans proposed by Teach the Controversy proponents.\n\nThe roots of the intelligent design movement's strategy are found in the past attempts of creationists to force religious views into public school science classes. The most recent of these had been creation science, which sought to provide a scientific veneer for the biblical account of Genesis. The characteristics of the intelligent design movement are a direct response to the tactical and legal failings of earlier creationist movements. Design proponents' strategies represent a natural evolution of the \"creation science\" movement, proceeding still further in the direction of claiming the mantle of science while denying their religious intentions in argument.\n\nComparisons of the drafts of the intelligent design textbook \"Of Pandas and People\" before and after the 1987 \"Edwards v. Aguillard\" ruling showed that the definition given in the book for creation science in pre Edwards drafts is identical to the definition of intelligent design in post Edwards drafts; cognates of the word creation—creationism and creationist, which appeared approximately 150 times were deliberately and systematically replaced with the phrase 'intelligent design'; and the changes occurred shortly after the Supreme Court ruled in \"Edwards\" that creation science is religious and cannot be taught in public school science classes.\n\nThe campaign was devised by Stephen C. Meyer and Discovery Institute founder and President Bruce Chapman as a compromise strategy in March 2002. They had come to the realisation that the dispute over intelligent design's (lack of) scientific standing was complicating their efforts to have evolution challenged in the science classroom. This strategy was designed to move the focus onto an approach that stresses open debate and evolution's purported weakness, but does not require students to study intelligent design. The intention was to create doubt over evolution and avoid the question of whether the intelligent designer was God, while giving the institute time to strengthen their purported theory of intelligent design. Another advantage of this strategy was to allay teacher fears of legal action.\n\nThe Discovery Institute's strategy has been for the institute itself or groups acting on its behalf to lobby state and local boards of education, and local, state and federal policymakers to enact policies and/or laws, often in the form of textbook disclaimers and the language of state science standards, that undermine or remove evolutionary theory from the public school science classroom by portraying it as \"controversial\" and \"in crisis;\" a portrayal that stands in contrast to the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community that there is no controversy, that evolution is one of the best-supported theories in all of science, and that whatever controversy does exist is political and religious, not scientific. The Teach the Controversy strategy has benefitted from 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with intelligent design proponents as alluded to in the Discovery Institute's Wedge Strategy.\n\nAs the primary organizer and promoter of the Teach the Controversy campaign, the Discovery Institute has played a central role in nearly all intelligent design cases, often working behind the scenes to orchestrate, underwrite and support local campaigns and intelligent design groups such as the Intelligent Design Network. It has provided support ranging from material assistance to federal, state and regionally elected representatives in the drafting of bills to the provision of support and advice to individual parents confronting their school boards. DI's goal is to move from battles over standards to curriculum writing and textbook adoption while undermining the central positions of evolution in biology and methodological naturalism in science. In order to make their proposals more palatable, the Institute and its supporters claim to advocate presenting evidence both for and against evolution, thus encouraging students to evaluate the evidence.\n\nThough Teach the Controversy is presented by its proponents as encouraging academic freedom, it, along with the Santorum Amendment, is viewed by many academics as a threat to academic freedom and is rejected by the National Science Teachers Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The American Society for Clinical Investigation's \"Journal of Clinical Investigation\" describes the Teach the Controversy strategy and campaign as a \"hoax\" and that \"the controversy is manufactured.\"\n\nAlong with the objection that there is no scientific controversy to teach, another common objection is that the Teach the Controversy campaign and intelligent design arise out of a Christian fundamentalist and evangelistic movement that calls for broad social, academic and political changes. Intelligent design proponents argue their concepts and motives should be given independent consideration. Those critical of intelligent design see the two as intertwined and inseparable, citing the foundational documents of the movement such as the \"Wedge Document\" and statements made by intelligent design proponents to their constituents. The judge in the \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" trial considered testimony and evidence from both sides on the question of the motives of intelligent design proponents when he ruled that \"ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents\" and \"that ID is an interesting theological argument, but that it is not science.\"\n\nIn the debate surrounding the linking of the motives of intelligent design proponents to their arguments, following the Kansas evolution hearings the chairman of the Kansas school board, Steve Abrams, cited in The New York Times as saying that though he's a creationist who believes that God created the universe 6,500 years ago, he is able to keep the two separate:\n\nAfterward, Lawrence Krauss, a Case Western Reserve University physicist and astronomer, in a New York Times essay said: \n\nA rudimentary form of the teach the controversy strategy had emerged first among creationists following the Supreme Court's \"Edwards v. Aguillard\" decision. The Institute for Creation Research (ICR) prepared an evaluation of what the movement should try next, suggesting \"school boards and teachers should be strongly encouraged at least to stress the scientific evidences and arguments against evolution in their classes . . . even if they don't wish to recognize these as evidences and arguments for creationism.\" Glenn Branch of the National Center for Science Education says this comment shows that the teach the controversy strategy was \"pioneered in the wake of Edwards v. Aguillard.\"\n\nPrior to the September 2005 start of the \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" trial, the \"Dover trial,\" prominent intelligent design proponents gradually shifted to a \"Teach the Controversy\" strategy. They had realised that mandates requiring the teaching of intelligent design were unlikely to survive challenges based on the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and that an unfavorable ruling had the effect of legally ruling intelligent design a form of religious creationism.\n\nThus, the Discovery Institute repositioned itself. It publicly abandoned advocating for any policies or laws that required the teaching of intelligent design in favor of a Teach the Controversy strategy. Institute Fellows reasoned that once the \"fact\" that a controversy indeed exists had been established in the public's mind, then the reintroduction of intelligent design into public school criteria would be much less controversial later.\n\nThe best illustration of this shift in strategy is comparing the Discovery Institute's 1999 guidebook \"Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curricula\" which concludes \"school boards have the authority to permit, and even encourage, teaching about design theory as an alternative to Darwinian evolution\" to 2006 statements by Phillip E. Johnson, that his intent was never to use public school education as the forum for his ideas and that he hoped to ignite and perpetuate a debate in universities and among the higher echelon of scientific thinkers.\n\nWith the December 2005 ruling in \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", wherein Judge John E. Jones III concluded that intelligent design is not science, intelligent design proponents were left with the Teach the Controversy strategy as the most likely method left to realize the goals stated in the wedge document. Thus, the Teach the Controversy strategy has become the primary thrust of the Discovery Institute in promoting its aims. Just as intelligent design is a stalking horse for the campaign against what its proponents claim is a materialist foundation in science that precludes God, Teach the Controversy has become a stalking horse for intelligent design. But the \"Dover\" ruling also characterized \"teaching the controversy\" as part of a religious ploy.\n\nBy May 2006 the Discovery Institute sought to replace the failed \"teach the controversy\" strategy with a strategy broadened to include examples of other supposedly legitimate scientific controversies. In Ohio and Michigan where school boards were again reviewing science curricula standards the Discovery Institute and its allies proposed lesson plans that included global warming, cloning and stem cell research as further examples of controversies that are akin to the alleged scientific controversy over evolution. All four topics are widely accepted by the majority of the scientific community as legitimate science, and all four are areas where US political conservatives have been known to be critical of the scientific consensus. Members of the scientific community have responded to this tactic by pointing out that like evolution whatever controversy may exist over cloning and stem cell research has been largely social and political, while dissident viewpoints over global warming are often viewed as pseudoscience. Richard B. Hoppe, holder of a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from the University of Minnesota, described the tactic in the following way:\nWith the \"Dover\" ruling describing \"teach the controversy\" as \"at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard\", intelligent design proponents have moved to a fallback position, emphasizing contrived flaws in evolution and overemphasizing remaining questions in the theory what they call the \"Critical Analysis of Evolution\". The \"Critical Analysis of Evolution\" strategy is viewed by Nick Matzke and other intelligent design critics as a means of teaching all the intelligent design arguments without using the intelligent design label. \"Critical Analysis of Evolution\" continues the themes of the teach the controversy strategy, emphasizing what they say are the \"criticisms\" of evolutionary theory and \"arguments against evolution,\" which continues to be portrayed as \"a theory in crisis.\" Early drafts of the Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan referred to the lesson as the \"great evolution debate\"; one of the early drafts of the lesson plan had one section titled \"Conducting the Macroevolution Debate\". In a subsequent draft, it was changed to \"Conducting the Critical Analysis Activity\". The wording for the two sections is nearly identical, with just \"debate\" changed to \"critical analysis activity\" wherever it appeared, in the manner of how intelligent design proponents simply replaced \"creation\" with \"intelligent design\" in \"Of Pandas and People\" to repackage a creation science textbook into an intelligent design textbook.\n\nThe campaigns of intelligent design proponents seeking curricular challenges have been disruptive, divisive and expensive for the affected communities. In pursuing the goal of establishing intelligent design at the expense of evolution in public school science classes, intelligent design groups have threatened and isolated high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts. The campaigns run by intelligent design groups place teachers in the difficult position of arguing against their employers while the legal challenges to local school districts are costly, diverting funding away from education and into court battles. For example, as a result of the Dover trial, the Dover Area School District was forced to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages for pursuing a policy of \"teaching the controversy\".\n\nFour days after the six-week \"Dover\" trial concluded, all eight of the Dover school board members who were up for reelection were voted out of office. Televangelist Pat Robertson in turn told the citizens of Dover, \"If there is a disaster in your area, don't turn to God. You just rejected him from your city.\" Robertson said if they have future problems in Dover, \"I recommend they call on Charles Darwin. Maybe he can help them.\"\n\nCritics, like Wesley R. Elsberry, say the Discovery Institute has cynically manufactured much of the political and religious controversy to further its agenda, pointing to statements of prominent proponents like Johnson:\nTo the absence of actual scientific controversy over the validity of evolutionary theory, Johnson said:\nAnd to the resistance of science educators over portraying evolution as controversial or disputed, Johnson said:\nElsberry and others allege that statements like Johnson's are proof that the alleged scientific controversy intelligent design proponents seek to have taught is a product of the institute's members and staff. In the \"Dover\" trial's ruling the judge wrote that intelligent design proponents had misrepresented the scientific status of evolution.\n\nAccording to published reports, the nonprofit Discovery Institute received grants and gifts totaling $4.1 million for 2003 from 22 foundations. Of these, two-thirds had primarily religious missions. The institute spends more than $1 million a year for research, polls, lobbying and media pieces that support intelligent design and their Teach the Controversy campaign and is employing the same Washington, D.C. public relations firm that promoted the Contract with America.\n\nThe Discovery Institute aggressively promotes its Teach the Controversy campaign and intelligent design to the public, education officials and public policymakers. Its efforts are largely aimed at conservative Christian policymakers, where it is cast as a counterbalance to the liberal influences of \"atheistic scientists\" and \"Dogmatic Darwinists.\" As a measure of their success in this effort, on 1 August 2005, during a round-table interview with reporters from five Texas newspapers, President Bush said that he believes schools should discuss intelligent design alongside evolution when teaching students about the origin of life. Bush, a conservative Christian, declined to go into detail on his personal views of the origin of life, but advocated the \"Teach the Controversy\" approach - \"I think that part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought... you're asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas, the answer is yes.\" Christian conservatives, a substantial part of Bush's voting base, have been central in promoting the Teach the Controversy campaign.\n\nIn some state battles, the ties of Teach the Controversy and intelligent design proponents to the Discovery Institute's political and social activities have been made public resulting in their efforts being temporarily thwarted. The Discovery Institute takes the view that all publicity is good and that no defeat is real. The Institute has shown a willingness to back off, even to not advocate for the inclusion of ID, to ensure that all science teachers are required to portray evolution as a \"theory in crisis.\" The Institute's strategy is to move, relentlessly, from standards battles, to curriculum writing, to textbook adoption, and back again doing whatever it takes to undermine the central position of evolution in biology. Critics of this strategy and the movement contend that the intelligent design controversy diverts much time, effort and tax money away from the actual education of children.\n\n\nThe theory of evolution is accepted by the vast majority of biologists and by the scientific community in general, in such overwhelming numbers that the theory of evolution is viewed as having scientific consensus. Over 70 scientific societies, institutions, and other professional groups representing tens of thousands individual scientists have issued policy statements supporting evolution education and opposing intelligent design. Scientific controversies are minor and concern the details of the mechanisms of evolution, not the validity of the overarching theory of evolution. In the absence of an actual professional controversy between groups of experts on evolution, critics say intelligent design proponents have merely renamed the conflict that already existed between biologists and creationists, and that the controversy to which intelligent design proponents refer is political in nature and thus, by definition, outside of the realm of science and scientific educational curricula. Critics contend that intelligent design proponents ignore this point by continuing to make the claim of a \"scientific controversy.\" According to Thomas Dixon, \"The 'controversy' in question has not arisen from any substantial scientific disagreement but is the product of a concerted public relations exercise aimed at the Christian parents of America.\"\n\nFor example, the National Association of Biology Teachers, in a statement endorsing evolution as noncontroversial, quoted Theodosius Dobzhansky: \"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\" and went on to state that the quote \"accurately reflects the central, unifying role of evolution in biology. The theory of evolution provides a framework that explains both the history of life and the ongoing adaptation of organisms to environmental challenges and changes.\" They emphasized that \"Scientists have firmly established evolution as an important natural process\" and that \"The selection of topics covered in a biology curriculum should accurately reflect the principles of biological science. Teaching biology in an effective and scientifically honest manner requires that evolution be taught in a standards-based instructional framework with effective classroom discussions and laboratory experiences.\"\n\nProminent evolutionary biologists such as Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne have proposed various \"controversies\" that are worth teaching, instead of intelligent design. Dawkins compares teaching intelligent design in schools to teaching flat earthism: perfectly fine in a history class but not in science. \"If you give the idea that there are two schools of thought within science, one that says the earth is round and one that says the earth is flat, you are misleading children.\" Tufts University Professor of Philosophy Daniel C. Dennett, author of \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\", describes how they generate a sense of controversy: \"The proponents of intelligent design use an ingenious ploy that works something like this: First you misuse or misdescribe some scientist's work. Then you get an angry rebuttal. Then, instead of dealing forthrightly with the charges leveled, you cite the rebuttal as evidence that there is a 'controversy' to teach.\"\n\nCritics of the Teach the Controversy movement and strategy can also be found outside of the scientific community. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, described the approach of the movement's proponents as \"a disarming subterfuge designed to undermine solid evidence that all living things share a common ancestry.\" \"The movement is a veneer over a certain theological message. Every one of these groups is now actively engaged in trying to undercut sound science education by criticizing evolution,\" said Lynn. \"It is all based on their religious ideology. Even the people who don't specifically mention religion are hard-pressed with a straight face to say who the intelligent designer is if it's not God.\" Bill Maher said of Teach the Controversy, \"You don't have to teach both sides of a debate if one side is a load of crap.\"\n\nAccording to critics of the Discovery Institute's efforts through the Teach the Controversy campaign and the intelligent design movement, the Wedge strategy betrays the Institute's political rather than scientific and educational purpose. The Discovery Institute and its Center for Science and Culture (CSC) has an overarching conservative Christian social and political agenda that seeks to redefine both law and science and how they are conducted, with the stated goal of a religious \"renewal\" of American culture.\n\nCritics also allege that the Discovery Institute has a long-standing record of misrepresenting research, law and its own policy and agenda and that of others:\n\n\nJohnson's statements validate the criticisms leveled by those who allege that the Discovery Institute and its allied organizations are merely stripping the obvious religious content from their anti-evolution assertions as a means of avoiding the legal restriction on establishment. They argue that ID is simply an attempt to put a patina of secularity on top of what is a fundamentally religious belief and agenda.\n\nGiven the history of the Discovery Institute as an organization committed to opposing any scientific theory inconsistent with \"the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God\", many scientists regard the movement purely as a ploy to insert creationism into the science curriculum rather than as a serious attempt to discuss scientific evidence. In the words of Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Education:\nThough Teach the Controversy proponents cite the current public policy statements of the Discovery Institute as belying the criticisms that their strategy is a creationist ploy and decry critics as biased in failing to recognize that the intelligent design movement's Teach the Controversy strategy as really just a question of science with no religion involved, is itself belied by Discovery Institute's former published policy statements, its \"Wedge Document\", and statements made to its constituency by its leadership, and in particular Phillip E. Johnson.\n\nWrites Johnson in the foreword to Creation, Evolution, & Modern Science (2000):\n\nAmid this political and religious controversy the clear, categorical and oft-repeated view of established national and international scientific organizations remains that there is no \"scientific\" controversy over teaching evolution in public schools.\n\nGeorge Mason University Biology Department introduced a 1-credit course on the creation/evolution controversy, and Emmett Holman, an associate professor of philosophy from the university, found that as students learn more about biology, they find objections to evolution less convincing. He concluded that \"teaching the controversy\" would undermine creationists’ criticisms, and that the scientific community’s resistance to this approach was bad public relations. Rather than being taught in a mainstream science course, it would be a separate elective course, probably taught by a scientist but called a course on \"philosophy of science\", \"history of science\", or \"politics of science and religion\".\n\nBiologist Tom A. Langen argues in a journal letter entitled \"What is right with ‘teaching the controversy’?\" that offering a specific course about this controversy will help students understand the demarcation between science and other ways of obtaining knowledge about nature. Similar positions have been expressed by atheists Julian Baggini and Aaron Sloman.\n\n\n\n"}
