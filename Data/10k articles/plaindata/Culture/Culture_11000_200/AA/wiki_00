It was the first and most influential modern work written in vernacular Chinese in the republican era, and would become a cornerstone piece of the New Culture Movement. It is placed first in \"Call to Arms\", a collection of short stories by Lu Xun. The story was often referred to as \"China's first modern short story\". This book was selected as one of the 100 best books in history by the Bokklubben World Library.\n\nThe diary form was inspired by Nikolai Gogol's short story \"Diary of a Madman\", as was the idea of the madman who sees reality more clearly than those around him. The \"madman\" sees \"cannibalism\" both in his family and the village around him, and he then finds cannibalism in the Confucian classics which had long been credited with a humanistic concern for the mutual obligations of society, and thus for the superiority of Confucian civilization. The story was read as an ironic attack on traditional Chinese culture and a call for a New Culture.\n\nThe story presents itself as diary entries (in Vernacular Chinese) of a madman who, according to the foreword, written in Classical Chinese, has now been cured of his paranoia. After extensively studying the Four books and five classics of old Confucian culture, the diary writer, the supposed \"madman\", begins to see the words \"Eat People!\" () written between the lines of the texts (in classical Chinese texts, commentary was placed between the lines of the text, rather than in notes at the bottom of a page). Seeing the people in his village as potential man-eaters, he is gripped by the fear that everyone, including his brother, his venerable doctor and his neighbors, who are crowding about watching him, are harboring cannibalistic thoughts on him. Despite the brother's apparently genuine concern, the narrator still regards him as a big threat, as big as any stranger. Towards the end the narrator turns his concern to the younger generation, especially his late sister (who died when she was five) as he is afraid they will be cannibalized. By then he is convinced that his late sister had been eaten up by his brother, and that he himself might have unwittingly tasted her flesh.\n\nThe story ends with the famous line: \"Save the children...\"\n\n"}

Their language was closely related to the other Great Andamanese languages. They were extinct as a distinct people by 1921.\n\nThe Great Andamanese languages are agglutinative languages, with an extensive prefix and suffix system. They have a distinctive noun class system based largely on body parts, in which every noun and adjective may take a prefix according to which body part it is associated with (on the basis of shape, or functional association). Thus, for instance, the *aka- at the beginning of the language names is a prefix for objects related to the tongue. An adjectival example can be given by the various forms of \"yop\", \"pliable, soft\", in Aka-Bea: \nSimilarly, \"beri-nga\" \"good\" yields:\n\nThe prefixes are,\n\nBody parts are inalienably possessed, requiring a possessive adjective prefix to complete them, so one cannot say \"head\" alone, but only \"my, or his, or your, etc. head\".\n\nThe basic pronouns are almost identical throughout the Great Andamanese languages; Aka-Bea will serve as a representative example (pronouns given in their basic prefixal forms):\n'This' and 'that' are distinguished as \"k-\" and \"t-\". \n\nJudging from the available sources, the Andamanese languages have only two cardinal numbers — one and two — and their entire numerical lexicon is one, two, one more, some more, and all.\n"}

Collectively, Alliance members represent the majority of North American imports of ready-made garments from Bangladesh, produced in more than 700 factories.\n\nAfter the 2013 Savar building collapse, Walmart became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety. Monsoon was a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) from before the 2013 Savar building collapse due to structural integrity and failure.\n\nThe building had housed a number of separate garment factories employing around 5,000 people, several shops, and a bank. The factories manufactured apparel for brands including Benetton, Monsoon Accessorize, Bonmarché, the Children's Place, El Corte Inglés, Joe Fresh, Mango, Matalan, Primark, and Walmart.\n\nThe Alliance was organized through the U.S. Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) with discussions convened and chaired by former U.S. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-ME) and former U.S. Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME). The collaborative formation process involved apparel industry companies and stakeholders, including the U.S. and Bangladeshi governments, policymakers, international NGOs, and members of civil society and organized labor in Bangladesh. On July 10, 2013, the group announced the Bangladesh Worker Safety Initiative. The Initiative is a binding, five-year plan focused on fire and building safety inspections, worker training, and worker empowerment.\n\nThe Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety has elected former US Representative Ellen Tauscher as independent chairperson.\n\nThe company responsible for managing the Alliance is ELEVATE under CEO Ian Spaulding. http://www.elevatelimited.com\n\n\nThe Alliance helped develop a common Fire Safety and Structural Integrity Standard – founded on the requirements of the 2006 Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC), though the Standard exceeds those requirements in some cases. The Standard was developed and is being implemented to ensure that all Member factories are held to the same safety requirements. The Standard was developed by technical experts from both the Alliance and the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, and finalized in December 2013. The Standard has been harmonized with the guidelines developed by the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) for the National Tripartite Plan of Action (NTPA).\n\nThe Alliance has retained a committee of independent fire and structural safety experts from Bangladesh, Europe and North America who are credentialed authorities in fire or building structural safety. The Committee of Experts (COE) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Alliance Standard, which includes approving qualified inspectors, conducting spot audits of remediation efforts and validating inspection reports. The Alliance has publicly announced that it aims to inspect all factories producing for its members by July 10, 2014.\n\nThe Alliance is working with the Fair Factories Clearinghouse, a non-profit organization that provides software to facilitate information-sharing. Alliance Members use this public platform to provide and exchange information about factories they use, fire and building safety training programs and curricula, and submit monthly reports on safety inspections and progress update on remediation plans being undertaken.\n\nThe Standard is used to evaluate all Alliance factories. The Board of Directors issues semi-annual public reports detailing its work and progress toward meeting in-country fire and building safety objectives, as well as training and worker empowerment goals.\n\nIn early September, 2015 the Alliance has recognized six RMG factories of Bangladesh to international standard as they finished all reformation works. These factories are; Green Textile, Kwun Tong Apparel, Laundry Industries, Lenny Apparel, Optimum Fashions, and Univogue.\n\nIn November and December 2013, the Alliance conducted a Worker Baseline Survey among more than 3,200 workers in 28 garment factories in Bangladesh. 10 focus groups were conducted off-site with 101 participants in three Bangladeshi regions to obtain more information on fire and other health and safety issues.\n\nThe purpose of the survey and the off-site interviews was to better understand the current level of awareness of health and safety risks and what workers believe needs to be done to improve safety and reduce risk in the factories. It is also a tool that will inform the necessary detail of our training programs.\n\nThe Alliance's worker helpline and education program will be implemented by three worker empowerment-focused, organizations, working in partnership. Clear Voice, the organization that provides tools for communication with workers, was founded by an early worker rights and human rights pioneer, Doug Cahn. Clear Voice will partner with Phulki, one of Bangladesh's leading worker rights non-governmental organizations (NGO), and Good World Solutions, whose focus will be on applying its Labor Link technology to train workers on their rights and survey them on their wellbeing.\n\nBeginning March 2014, the helpline program will be piloted in 50 factories Dhaka and Chittagong, with in-factory orientations to accompany the launch at each location. Helplines will roll out to 100 factories by March 2015, with the goal of becoming functional in all Alliance factories by 2017.\n\nOn December 9, 2013, the Alliance opened an office in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where the Alliance is focused on inspection implementation, development of a worker training curriculum, establishing a worker empowerment helpline, and building local capacity for completing factory improvements. As of February 2014, the Dhaka office serves as the primary hub for staff and organizational activities. All staff members in the Dhaka office are Bangladeshi nationals who bring decades of combined experience in Bangladesh's garment industry. As of March 2014, the team includes a managing director, managers for fire and structural safety, assessments, training, worker outreach and empowerment, factory liaison and remediation, as well as other support staff.\n\nThe Board of Directors is entrusted with oversight responsibility for Alliance Members' compliance with Initiative requirements, such as meeting financial obligations and self-imposed deadlines for achieving inspections, information-sharing and worker training agreements.\n\nThe Board has the authority to investigate possible non-compliance, and take appropriate action against delinquent companies, by a two-thirds majority vote, including termination of membership in the Alliance.\n\n"}

It is used to burnish (firmly rub) the back of a sheet of paper, lifting ink from the block.\nThe baren is made of layers. A flat coil of braided cord forms the core. This is placed on a disk (\"ategawa\") consisting of 30–40 sheets of high-grade long-fibred hosokawa paper, wrapped in tissue and black lacquer. This is covered by a thin bamboo sheath (\"takenokawa\") twisted in such a manner as to form the handle on the top. According to Hiroshi Yoshida's manual \"Japanese Woodblock Printing\" (1939) the \"madake\" species of bamboo, grown in Kyushu, southwest Japan, is considered the best one to use.\n\nThe bamboo-sheath covering the baren may need to be renewed after a day's printing. Rewrapping requires great skill; a printer's ability is sometimes judged by their competence carrying out this work.\n\nThe disk inside the baren takes 40–50 days to create, as the craftsman glues one sheet of paper on the disk each day. The disk must then dry for a year before the baren is assembled. The coil and covering of the baren are woven and formed from parts of the bamboo plant, requiring the skill of a true master. Only one known person in Japan is still making traditional (\"hon\") baren for a living — Hidehiko Goto of the Kikuhide workshop.\n\nLarge wooden spoons are also used as burnishing tools in printmaking, glass jars with a smooth circular base can also be used for some applications. Some new world barens are similar in shape to the traditional one with small metal ball bearings embedded in the bottom surface that generate the high point contact pressures (supplied by the braided cord) and have the low friction (offered by the bamboo leaf covering) of a traditional brayer. Another interesting baren is one developed by Professor Seishi Ozakus and made from a bundle of bamboo toothpicks.\n\nNik Semenoff has developed a palm press that serves as a baren replacement, made with a number of roller bearings alternating on two close spaced shafts in a small hand held mounting. The bearings have negligible friction and the pressures achievable are suitable for some offset lithography printing, though wider spacing of fewer contact points may make it less suited for traditional wood cut printing.\n\n"}

{"id": "1453343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1453343", "title": "Charreada", "text": "Charreada\n\nThe charreada () or charrería () is a competitive event similar to rodeo and was developed from animal husbandry practices used on the haciendas of old Mexico. The sport has been described as \"living history,\" or as an art form drawn from the demands of working life. In 2016, charrería was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.\n\nEvolving from the traditions brought from Spain in the 16th century, the first charreadas were ranch work competitions between haciendas. The modern Charreada developed after the Mexican Revolution when \"charro\" traditions were disappearing. The competing charros often came from families with a tradition of Charreria, and teams today are often made up from extended families who have been performing for up to five generations.\n\nThe \"charreada\" consists of nine events for men plus one for women, all of which involve horses, cattle or both. Some of the events in the charreada have been criticized by animal advocacy groups and some states have banned certain events. However, there is an absence of independent statistical data and unbiased recording of the injury rate of animals has not been undertaken.\n\nCharrería, a word encompassing all aspects of the art, evolved from the traditions that came to Mexico from Salamanca, Spain in the 16th century. When the Spanish first settled in Colonial Mexico, they were under orders to raise horses, but not to allow Native Americans to ride. However, by 1528 the Spanish had very large cattle-raising estates and found it necessary to employ indigenous people as vaqueros or herdsman, who soon became excellent horsemen. Smaller landholders, known as rancheros or ranchers, were the first genuine charros and they are credited as the inventors of the charreada.\n\nPrior to the Mexican Revolution, ranch work competitions were generally between haciendas. Before World War I, there was little difference between rodeo and charreada. Athletes from the United States, Mexico and Canada competed in all three countries. Subsequently, charreada was formalized as an amateur team sport and the international competitions ceased.\n\nFollowing the breakup of the \"haciendas\" by the Mexican Revolution, the \"charros\" saw their traditions slipping away. They met in 1921 and formed the \"Asociación Nacional de Charros\" to keep the \"charrería\" tradition alive. The advent of the Mexican cinema brought greater popularity, especially musicals which combined rancheras with the \"charro\" image, akin to the Western and \"singing cowboy\" genres in the United States.\n\nMexican Americans in the United States also held various \"charreadas\" during the same period, but in the 1970s, the \"Federación Mexicana de Charrería\" (FMCH) began assisting them in establishing official \"charreadas\" north of the border. They are now quite common. At times, US champion teams compete in the national competition of Mexico.\n\nThe participants in the \"charreada\" wear traditional \"charro\" clothing, including a closely fitted suit, chaps, boots, and a wide brim sombrero. The body-fitting suit of the charro, while decorative, is also practical; it fits closely to insure there is no flapping cloth to be caught by the horns of steers. The \"botinas\", or little boots, prevent feet from slipping through the stirrups. Spurs are worn on the botinas.\n\nThe saddle of the charro has a wider horn than that of a western saddle, which helps safeguard the charro from being pitched off and from being hung up. There are two grips at the back of the saddle, in case the charro needs to hold on because of a buck or some other unexpected act of the horse.\n\nA \"charreada\" is held within a marked-off area of an arena called a \"Lienzo charro\" consisting of a lane wide by long leading into a circle in diameter.\nIn the opening ceremony, organizations and participants parade into the arena on horseback, usually accompanied by a mariachi band playing \"Marcha Zacatecas\". This signifies the long tradition of Charros being an auxiliary arm of the Mexican Army. The short charro jacket is remniscent of that worn by members of Villa's Army.\n\nThe \"charreada\" itself consists of nine scoring events staged in a particular order for men. Unlike rodeos, most \"charreadas\" do not award money to the winners as charreadas are considered an amateur, rather than professional sport. Prizes may take the form of trophies. Unlike American rodeo, events are not timed but judged and scored based on finesse and grace. Charreada historically enjoys greater prestige in Mexico than in the United States.\n\nUntil recently, the charreada was confined to men but a women's precision equestrian event called the escaramuza is now the tenth and final event in a charreada. The event involves women's teams dressed in a style reminiscent of the nineteenth century, participating in precisely choreographed patterns for horses. The immediate antecedent of the present Escaramuzas were the \"Adelitas\", or \"women of the revolution.\" Tradition holds that women on horseback were decoys during the Mexican revolution. The women would ride off to raise a cloud of dust so that the Federales were deceived into thinking an attack would come from that direction. The revolutionaries would then attack from the rear.\n\nThe women in the escaramuza are mounted \"a mujeriegas\", that is, in an \"albarda\" or sidesaddle that is peculiar in style to the Charrería but the underlying design has also evolved over hundreds of years in both Europe and North Africa. The traditional \"albarda\" for the Escaramuza is a cut down charro saddle, with a leather seat and leg braces, U-shaped for the right leg and C-shaped for the left leg.\n\nThe \"charreada\" itself consists of a number of scoring events staged in a particular order—nine for the men and one for the women. Two or more teams, called \"asociaciones\", compete against each other. Teams can compete to become state, regional, and national champions. The competitors are judged by both style and execution.\n\nUnlike rodeos, most \"charreadas\" do not award money to the winners as \"charreadas\" are considered an amateur sport, not professional. Under Mexican laws it would be illegal to receive a monetary reward for participating in a \"charreada\". At times there are such prizes as saddles or horse trailers.\n\n\nVarious aspects of charreada have been criticized by animal welfare groups in the United States as being inhumane. While some animal rights organizations oppose many or all aspects of both charreada and American-style rodeo, other organizations do not oppose rodeos generally or the charreada events that are similar to those seen in US rodeo. However, they do oppose specific charreada events, particularly steer-tailing and those that involve roping horses, which are grouped under the term \"horse-tripping.\"\n\nThese organizations have particular criticism for \"piales\" and \"mangana,\" the heeling and two forefooting events that involve roping of horses, where they claim that the horses used will often sustain injuries, including broken bones and teeth, dislocated joints, and lacerations. The distinction claimed between Manganas, or horse-tripping, and events that rope cattle, such as calf roping, is that the high center of gravity of a horse, the longer legs and faster speed of a horse creates greater potential for injury, whereas cattle are smaller, have a low center of gravity, are slower and have sturdier limbs. There are additional concerns that horses are underfed and overused, repeatedly roped until lame, with rope burns down to the bone.\n\nforefooting is not permitted in motion pictures monitored by the American Humane Association. The California-based Charros Federation USA states that it has voluntarily banned horse-tripping in mainstream charros for over 15 years. They also note, however, that the complete capture in mangana was not stopped due to a belief that there was an unreasonable danger to the horses used, but so teams from California would not be at a disadvantage when they competed in the United States, after a 1994 California law stopped the take down in mangana. Under the Federation rules, the complete capture is still permitted in Mexico.\n\nNine US states, including the southwestern border states of Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona, have banned horse-tripping as a sport, although horses may still be roped and taken to the ground when required for veterinary care, identification and branding; or essentially, reasons other than entertainment. In 2011, the state legislatures of Oregon and Nevada considered but did not pass bills that would have stopped horse tripping, and, in Colorado, a bill intended to ban both horse-tripping and steer-tailing also failed.\n\nThere are also concerns about the steer tailing event, due to concerns that a steer can suffer injuries to his tail, but also his back and limbs as he rolls. Legislation to ban steer tailing, which also is an event seen in some rodeos, was introduced in at least two states.\n\nSupporters of Charreda defend the sport, stating that there is little evidence to support claims of inhumane treatment and noting that few animals are seriously injured. The Charro Federation has stated that experienced Charros know how to properly rope a horse without injuring it. The Charros Federation USA notes that fringe groups who do not follow mainstream standards give a bad name to the whole community. Supporters point out that events sanctioned by the Federación Mexicana de Charrería (FMCH) are held in both the United States and Mexico, and they operate under rules promulgated by the Federation. They also point to successful and highly public events such the Fiesta San Antonio, where Charreada has been an integral part of the festival for more than 60 years.\n\nThere are few hard statistics on either side of the issue. Many charreadas are loosely organized in the USA and obtaining data is a challenge. Informal reports by organizations on both sides of the issue exist. The American Horse Defense Fund claims that from 8 to 20 percent of horses leased for charreada in California were reported to be injured seriously enough to be \"sent to slaughter\" each week, and the president of the California Equine Council claimed to personally observe a circuit of 10 charreadas for which 78 horses were leased for a season's use, and only 2 were not sent to slaughter by the season's end. Arabian horses are said preferred by charros due to their lighter weight, and Arabian horse rescue organizations have reported on encountering rope-scarred animals in slaughter yards whose injuries have been attributed to charreada use by the feedlot owners.\n\nCharro associations question the legitimacy of these reports and lack of hard data. In 2011, Charreada organizers in Texas began keeping statistics on injuries to both animals and charros for events sanctioned by the FMCH. Since that time, they have self-published results from 1035 charreadas. 624 of which were held in Mexico, where traditional mangana, piales and cola events are offered. 411 charreadas were held in the United States, with non-traditional manganas, but traditional piales and cola. There were also an additional 10 coleaderos. They have reported 10 injured Charros, two steers with horns broken, three steers had tails broken in cola, one steer losing the hair at the end of its tail, one steer's leg broken in cola. A horse started limping after hitting a wall in Paso, but the lameness resolved a few hours later. A horse pulled a ligament in cola. One horse was killed when it flipped in a bucking event. In the Charreadas and Coleaderos, held in Mexico, 6601 steers, 18059 horses and 2009 bulls were used. In the Charreadas and Coleaderos held in the United States 4570 steers, 3905 horses and 1216 bulls were used.\n\nIn comparison, the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) reports an animal injury rate of less than one percent in its sanctioned US rodeos. However, The Charro Association notes that the PRCA only sanctions about 30 percent of all US rodeos, Unsanctioned rodeos may have higher abuse and injury rates, and the ASPCA notes that rodeo practice sessions are often the location of more severe abuses than competitions. Likewise, anecdotal reports suggest the worst charreada abuses in the USA occur at events held in small venues with little public notice, and the deepest concerns are directed these unsanctioned events. The problem appears to be most often reported in California, where horse-tripping is banned, yet private \"backyard\" events still feature these events.\n\nAn additional issue separate from the animal welfare debate is concern from some people within the Hispanic community that bans on charreada are a form of cultural discrimination. A professor from Yale University noted a correlation between anti-mangana laws and anti-immigrant policy in some southwestern states. Though initially such legislation often was introduced by those concerned with animal welfare, the debates were often taken over by \"nativists who demand border militarization,\nexclusion and deportation,\" citing as examples political figures who argued that people who abuse horses also abuse 'our children' and 'must be reminded of American laws'. Often, bans on charreada events corresponded with the passage of other blatantly anti-immigrant legislation.\n\nSupporters of the mangana and piales events argue that catching horses by their legs has been and is a legitimate method of animal husbandry and therefore part of a celebration of traditional ranching methods of Mexico. This is evidenced by the veterinary and ranch work exemptions in the California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas statutes. They also note the inclusion of mangana and piales in Charreada rules promulgated by the FMCH as proof of the tradition of catching horses by their legs.\nOn the other hand, others argue that horse-tripping is not a traditional part of Mexican culture. Individuals within the Mexican-American community such as Cesar Chavez have come out in opposition to inhumane treatment of animals being justified on cultural grounds. Chavez, who became a vegetarian and had concerns for the welfare of animals in general, had written a letter in 1990 to Action for Animals stating his view that legislation was needed to ensure the humane treatment of animals at rodeos and explaining that violence was linked with racism, economic deprivation, and various animal sports, including dog fighting, cockfighting, bullfighting, and rodeo. This letter did not specifically mention charreada, though Chavez drew particular attention to rodeos where no veterinarian was required to be present.\n\nThe legislative debate in California in 1994 brought this issue to the forefront. When the bill banning horse-tripping passed, there was concern that the legislation was part of an overall anti-immigration climate that the voters in California were generally favoring at the time. However, support from organizations such as the Mexican American Political Association, the Mexican American Chamber of Commerce, the United Farm Workers (UFW) and the International Longshore Workers Union helped procure passage of the bill.of the bill.\n\nWhen horse-tripping legislation was debated in California, the sponsor of the original bill was Joe Baca, an Assemblyman of Mexican descent who went on to become a member of the U.S. Congress. When the initial bill was submitted by Baca, it was criticized as discriminatory by other Mexican American Assembly members such as Richard Polanco. The original bill was defeated, but was resubmitted during an emergency session of the legislature. Assemblyman Baca did not sponsor the resubmitted legislation, instead it was sponsored by a non-Hispanic member, John Burton. However, unlike the situation in Arizona, during the debate leading to the ban enacted in 1994, the California Equine Legislative Counsel presented testimony that individuals such as Cesar Chavez and organizations including the Mexican American Political Association opposed horse-tripping as a \"cruel cultural anachronism.\"\n\nThe Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) does not take an official position on Horse tripping, as is not a sanctioned event. The California-based Charros Federation USA states that it has voluntarily banned horse-tripping in mainstream charros for over 15 years. There are two non-charreada events in the United States that ropes horses by their front legs, the non-PRCA Jordan Big Loop Rodeo and the Harney County Ranch Rodeo in Oregon.\n\nIn 2013, the Oregon legislature considered legislation regulating horse-roping events. The PRCA opposed the bill on the grounds that the activities of concern to sponsors are already covered adequately under existing animal cruelty legislation and because the wording could define roping the legs of horses for any reason as \"per se\" cruelty. Douglas Corey, chair of the Livestock Welfare Committee of the PRCA, said \"We do not feel that simply roping the legs of a horse is an act that should be banned.\".\"\n\nDuring the 2011 legislative debate in Nevada on legislation to ban the horse-tripping events, some opponents of a ban expressed concern that it would also undermine rodeos. However, this was disputed by supporters of a ban: \"Horse tripping is not a recognized event in any form of sanctioned rodeo...This issue has absolutely nothing to do with rodeos nor is it some back door attempt to attack rodeo and livestock events...\"\n\nOn the other hand, supporters of charreada point out that some rodeo associations initially opposed the California horse tripping ban, pointing out that when the original bill was submitted, supporters such as Eric Mills were also seeking to ban calf roping, \"steer busting\" and bulldogging. After the bill failed, the California Equine Counsel, who was not opposed to those events, stepped in as the main spokes group for the resubmitted bill. Once Mills no longer took an active role in the legislation, the Rodeo Associations decided to remain neutral, and the bill passed.\n\nIn 2011, SB 613, a bill to stop \"horse tripping\" was submitted in Oregon. This was opposed by the United Horsemen. \"They were joined by other SB 613 opponents, including the American Quarter Horse Association, the Oregon Quarter Horse Association, and the PRCA. Other opponents included the directors of the Pendleton Roundup plus other rodeo directors and supporters. The bill did not pass.\n\nThe PRCA also worked with the Charros' groups to stop a bill to make steer tailing illegal, and to stop legislation that would have required two weeks advance notice of rodeo events.\n\n\n"}

Another term for these people is eRider.\n\nIn this context, a circuit rider is part trainer, part management consultant, part computer expert. They provide consulting and assistance with technology strategy development, make multiple visits to the organizations they serve, and provide advice and information by phone and e-mail. They can serve regional constituencies by travel from a central location. Additionally, circuit riders can \"cross-pollinate\" the groups they service, transmitting insights, tools, and tips as they travel throughout the sector. In addition, training materials and resources can be used at multiple sites thereby spreading the development cost out across a number of organizations.\n\nThe umbrella term for this field is nonprofit technology, and Circuit Riders are a form of Nonprofit Technology Assistance Provider (NTAP)\n\nModern technology circuit riding for nonprofits began in the U.S. in the mid-1990s when Gavin Clabaugh at the Telecommunications Cooperative Network approached the W. Alton Jones Foundation to get funding for technology services for a group of the foundation's grantees. The making of a request directly from a service provider to a funding source (the foundation) to serve a group of grantees was a novel approach for technology provision in the nonprofit sector. To differentiate the approach it was given the name \"circuit riding\"\n\nThe community of Circuit Riders that eventually formed across the American nonprofit technology frontier was initiated by Rob Stuart while working at the Rockefeller Family Fund.

The anime is licensed by Funimation and aired on Adult Swim's newly revived Toonami block on May 26, 2012 and finished its run on August 11, 2012.\n\nA massive anomaly caused a great earthquake that ravaged Japan's mainland and destroyed most of Tokyo, sinking three-quarters of the city into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nTen years later, the story shifts to Ganta Igarashi, a seemingly ordinary student attending Nagano Prefecture's middle school. As an \"escapee\", a survivor of the great earthquake, Ganta has no memories of the tragedy and has lived a normal life. This all changes when a strange person covered in blood and crimson armor floats through his classroom windows. Grinning madly, the \"Red Man\" massacres Ganta's entire class. Instead of killing him, the \"Red Man\" embeds a red crystal shard in Ganta's chest. Within days of the massacre, Ganta is subjected to a kangaroo court as a suspect and is sentenced to death at \"Deadman Wonderland\", a prison that doubles as a theme park.\n\nArriving at the prison, Ganta is fitted with a special collar which monitors his location and vital signs. A lethal poison is constantly injected into his bloodstream through the collar, but it can be neutralized by consuming a peculiar candy-like medicine every three days, which can be acquired through various activities in the prison, e.g. performing for audiences, working backstage and purchasing with Cast Points (a form of currency among inmates at Deadman Wonderland). To gather Cast Points, an inmate must perform in the facility's lethal games and survive. Fortunately for Ganta, he is aided by a mysterious albino girl named Shiro who apparently knows Ganta but whose existence is unknown to the other prisoners.\n\nWhile trying to survive as an inmate on death row, Ganta intends to find the \"Red Man\" to clear his name. In a bizarre twist, Ganta begins to develop the ability to manipulate his own blood, to the point of turning it into a weapon. Unknown to Ganta, he has become one of the prison's \"Deadmen,\" an isolated group of prisoners possessing the \"Branches of Sin\" which is an ability which makes them capable of controlling their blood for their own uses. After his ability is discovered, Ganta is forced to participate in brutal gladiatorial death matches known as Carnival Corpse, whose anonymous spectators pay large amounts of money to watch. In his long struggle to survive, he manages to befriend some of those he fought off in the arena and with their help, Ganta continues his quest to uncover the identity of the 'Red Man', why he turned into a Deadman, and the dark secrets the prison authorities are hiding.\n\nDeadman Wonderland is Japan's only privately operated prison, built after the Great Tokyo Earthquake on ground zero. Deadman Wonderland was founded by Rinichirō Hagire and run by Tsunenaga Tamaki. It gathers prisoners from all over Japan and raises money for the revival of the destroyed metropolis. To the public and the tourists that visit daily, Deadman Wonderland is a massive theme park-like facility run by the prison population. Unbeknownst to the general population, most of the prison's attractions involve cruel games of survival where many inmates lose their lives or are maimed for the entertainment of an oblivious public. The prison guards are also granted autonomy over how to punish the prisoners, which often results in bloodshed.\n\nEach prisoner is fitted with a collar that functions as a life monitor, locator, and stunner. The prisoners on death row receive poison injections through their special collar and must consume a special antidote candy every three days. Their collars contain countdown timers that warn the wearer with blinking and beeping when time is running low. When the timer reaches zero, the collar displays the word \"DEAD\" and the inmate immediately succumbs to the poison and dies. Afterwards, the collar unlocks allowing it to be removed. The collars can also be removed by key cards used by the prison guards.\n\nWhile the threat of violence is constant at the prison, most prisoners enjoy a great deal of liberty inside Deadman Wonderland. Utilizing Cast Points, the prison's unique form of currency, prisoners can purchase a wide variety of items from ordinary lunches, luxurious furniture for their rooms, and even years off of their sentences. Though Cast Points can't be used to buy the freedom of a Deadman. Those on death row also use Cast Points to purchase their life-saving candies.\n\nDespite its identity as a prison and theme park, Deadman Wonderland houses a much darker secret. Hidden away from the eyes of tourists and the general prison population is a massive underground facility known as \"G Block\". This is where the prison keeps their Deadmen secluded and where the Carnival Corpse arena is located. G Block also houses numerous laboratories and rooms where experiments on humans are performed and where scientists are attempting to harness the powers of the Deadmen for monetary and political gain.\n\nEventually, Ganta and his Deadman allies received the assistance of Makina, the chief of the prison guards, to defeat Tsunenaga Tamaki. Rinichirō Hagire in Toto Sakagami's body assumed control of Deadman Wonderland while Tamaki committed suicide. After Deadman Wonderland was closed, the necklaces were removed from the inmates. Most of the remaining inmates were transferred to different prisons where some of them were allowed a retrial.\n\nMakina later rallies the Deadmen on a mission to infiltrate Deadman Wonderland and activate the Mother Goose Program to completely seal the Wretched Egg (another name for the Red Man), with the resulting battle destroying most of Deadman Wonderland.\n\nDeadman Wonderland runs a secret gladiator-like game called the \"Carnival Corpse\" (also referred to as the \"Carnival of Corpses\"), where wealthy anonymous donors pay to watch death-matches between the prison's Deadmen. The viewers of the Carnival Corpse also place their bets on who would win. Deadmen who are defeated yet survive the game have a part of their anatomy surgically removed for scientific research. In a cruel twist, the loser spins a bird-shaped macabre slot machine to determine which part of their body will be removed (with the show being broadcast live to the other prisoners) for research with the parts ranging from the right eye (which was removed from Senji), vocal cords (which were removed from Nagi), and the hair, kidney, and part of the stomach (which were removed from Minatsuki). The winner is awarded a large number of Cast Points, life-saving candies, and other prizes.\n\nOn July 30, 2009, a retailers' solicitation sheet reported that an anime adaptation had been green-lit. It is animated by Manglobe and aired in Japan between April 17, 2011, and July 3, 2011. An original video animation episode was released on October 8, 2011, alongside the eleventh manga volume. The opening theme is \"One Reason\" by DWB feat. Fade and the ending theme is \"Shiny Shiny\" by Nirgilis. The series is licensed by Funimation Entertainment and is now available on DVD and Blu-ray. The anime was broadcast on the revived Toonami block from May 26 to August 11, 2012. The anime aired in North America on the Funimation Channel on November 30, 2012.\n\nTwo pieces of theme music are used for the episodes: one opening theme and one ending theme. The opening theme is One Reason by Deadman Wonder Band (DWB) feat. Fade. The ending theme Shiny Shiny by DWB feat. NIRGILIS. The two themes are used in all 13 episodes. Certain characters have their own character song also, Ganta, Shiro, Genkaku and Minatsuki all have their own character song. The songs are created by DWB and NIRGILIS and the characters that the song is for provide the vocals.\n\nOn June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed \"Deadman Wonderland\" among 38 anime and manga titles banned in China.\n\nShiro's costume is featured in the video game \"Lollipop Chainsaw\".

{"id": "143806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143806", "title": "Doppelgänger", "text": "Doppelgänger\n\nA doppelgänger (; , literally \"double-goer\") is a non-biologically related look-alike or double of a living person, sometimes portrayed as a ghostly or paranormal phenomenon and usually seen as a harbinger of bad luck. Other traditions and stories equate a doppelgänger with an evil twin. In modern times, the term twin stranger is occasionally used. The word \"doppelgänger\" is often used in a more general and neutral sense, and in slang, to describe any person who physically or behaviorally resembles another person.\n\nThe word \"doppelgänger\" is a loanword from the German \"Doppelgänger\", a compound noun formed by combining the two nouns \"Doppel\" (double) and \"Gänger\" (walker or goer). The singular and plural forms are the same in German, but English usually prefers the plural \"doppelgängers\". The first known use, in the slightly different form \"Doppeltgänger\", occurs in the novel \"Siebenkäs\" (1796) by Jean Paul, in which he explains his newly coined word by a footnote – while actually the word \"Doppelgänger\" also appears, but with a quite different meaning.\n\nLike all nouns in German, the word is written with an initial capital letter. \"Doppelgänger\" and \"Doppelgaenger\" are essentially equivalent spellings, and \"Doppelganger\" is different and would correspond to a different pronunciation. In English, the word should be written with a lower-case letter (doppelgänger) unless it is the first word of a sentence or part of a title. It is further common to drop the umlaut on the letter \"a\", writing (and often pronouncing) \"doppelganger\".\n\nEnglish-speakers have only recently applied this German word to a paranormal concept. Francis Grose's, \"Provincial Glossary\" of 1787 used the term \"fetch\" instead, defined as the \"apparition of a person living.\" Catherine Crowe's book on paranormal phenomena, \"The Night-Side of Nature\" (1848) helped make the German word well-known. However, the concept of alter egos and double spirits has appeared in the folklore, myths, religious concepts, and traditions of many cultures throughout human history.\n\nIn Ancient Egyptian mythology, a \"ka\" was a tangible \"spirit double\" having the same memories and feelings as the person to whom the counterpart belongs. \"The Greek Princess\" presents an Egyptian view of the Trojan War in which a \"ka\" of Helen misleads Paris, helping to stop the war.. This is depicted in Euripides' play \"Helen\". In Norse mythology, a \"vardøger\" is a ghostly double who is seen performing the person's actions in advance. In Finnish mythology, this is called having an \"etiäinen\", \"a firstcomer\". The doppelgänger is a version of the Ankou, a personification of death, in Breton, Cornish, and Norman folklore.\n\nIzaak Walton claimed that English metaphysical poet John Donne saw his wife's doppelgänger in 1612 in Paris, on the same night as the stillbirth of their daughter.\n\nGerman playwright Goethe described an experience in his autobiography \"Dichtung und Wahrheit\" in which he and his double passed one another on horseback. In addition to describing the doppelgänger double as a counterpart to the self, Percy Bysshe Shelley's drama \"Prometheus Unbound\" makes reference to a dead child who \"met his own image walking in the garden\".\nLord Byron uses doppelgänger imagery to explore the duality of human nature.\n\nIn The Devil's Elixir (1815), a man murders the brother and stepmother of his beloved princess, finds his doppelgänger has been sentenced to death for these crimes in his stead, and liberates him, only to have the doppelgänger murder the object of his affection. This was one of E. T. A. Hoffmann's early novels.\n\nFyodor Dostoyevsky's novel \"The Double\" (1846) presents the doppelgänger as an opposite personality who exploits the character failings of the protagonist to take over his life. Charles Williams' \"Descent into Hell\" (1939) has character Pauline Anstruther seeing her own doppelgänger all through her life. Clive Barker's story \"Human Remains\" in his \"Books of Blood\" is a doppelgänger tale, and the doppelgänger motif is a staple of Gothic fiction.\n\nWith the advent of social media, there have been several reported cases of people finding their \"twin stranger\" online, a modern term for a doppelgänger. Twinstrangers.net is a website where users can upload a photo of themselves and facial recognition software attempts to match them with another user of like appearance. The site reports that it has found numerous living doppelgängersincluding three living doppelgängers of its founder Niamh Geaney.\n\nHeautoscopy is a term used in psychiatry and neurology for the hallucination of \"seeing one's own body at a distance\". It can occur as a symptom in schizophrenia and epilepsy, and is considered a possible explanation for doppelgänger phenomena.\n\nCriminologists find a practical application in the concepts of facial familiarity and similarity due to the instances of wrongful convictions based on eyewitness testimony. In one case, a person spent 17 years behind bars persistently denying any involvement with the crime of which he was accused. He was finally released after someone was found who shared a striking resemblance and the same first name.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45229059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45229059", "title": "Enactment effect", "text": "Enactment effect\n\nThe enactment effect, also called self-performed task effect (SPT effect) is a term that was created in the early 80's to describe the fact that verb phrases are memorized better if a learner performs the described action during learning, compared to just getting the verbal information or seeing someone else perform the action. The use of gestures improves the quantity of phrases that can be recalled, the phrases can be recalled for a longer amount of time, and they can be accessed easier. Knowing that enacting improves memory performance can be useful in education and treatment of patients with memory disorders. \nIn their study, Engelkamp and Krumnacker (1980) gave participants verbal phrases like “brush the teeth” or \"shuffle the cards\". In a recognition task and a free recall task, the memory of participants was tested under four learning conditions: one group performed the action, a second group was supposed to imagine the action, the third group watched someone perform the action, and the last group just heard the phrases. The group that had enacted the gestures performed best in both tasks.\nAround the same time, Cohen examined recall capacity of verbal phrases in participants under three conditions: one group performed the action on a concrete object, a second group saw the experimenter perform the action on an object, and a third group only got verbal instructions. The self-performed task led to the best results, supporting the claim that the enactment effect exists.\nSince then, the effect has been reduplicated in many studies.  Recall after enactment tasks was shown to be superior to recall after verbal tasks in children as well as in adults. Furthermore, the enactment effect is existent in elderly people and people with moderate dementia of the Alzheimer type.\n\nGestures have been shown to be a useful tool in teaching a foreign language. The enactment effect can be used in second language teaching in order to learn a language more efficiently, faster, and to prevent forgetting. Various studies have shown that the use of gestures while learning new words improves recall and retention. The enactment effect in second language learning could be shown in children as well as adults. Not only does enactment improve memorization, but also the use of words in speech production. Using gestures while learning is helpful in learning concrete words as well as abstract words such as “change” or “difference”. Studies supported this claim in showing that abstract words were better remembered when a gesture was used while encoding.\n\nIn more recent studies, researchers have been trying to find the neurological explanation of the enactment effect, and the reason why memory is enhanced after enactment. It was shown that not mere physical motor information leads to the enactment effect, but that the semantic content of the gesture plays a role as well. Iconic gestures enhance memory compared to meaningless gestures which have no positive effect on memorization. Event-related potentials showed that enactment leads to deeper processing of new information, eliciting the assumption that by using gestures, the meaning of the new word is connected with an already existing concept in one’s native language.\n"}

David Merrill, Professor Emeritus at Utah State University, is an instructional theory based on a broad review of many instructional models and theories. First Principles of Instruction are created with the goal of establishing a set of principles upon which all instructional theories and models are in general agreement, and several authors acknowledge the fundamental nature of these principles. These principles can be used to assist teachers, trainers and instructional designers in developing research-based instructional materials in a manner that is likely to produce positive student learning gains.\n\nFirst Principles of Instruction are described as a set of interrelated principles which, when properly applied in an instructional product or setting, will increase student learning. These principles include the following:\n\n\nThese principles can be used in a Task or Problem-Centered cycle of instruction beginning with Activation and continuing through Demonstration, Application, and Integration.\n\nFirst Principles of Instruction is similar to other task-centered instructional theories (e.g. Van Merriënboer’s Four Component Instructional Design Model) in that it uses a real-world problem or task as a vehicle for instruction. Students view demonstrations of real-world problem solving examples, are given opportunities to solve real-world problems and are given feedback on their application. Students are taught new knowledge and information within the context of the real-world task or problem, which provides a context in which the knowledge is obtained. First Principles is different than problem-based-learning, however, in that it provides more guidance and demonstration to students which is reduced as students gain expertise.\n\nThere is a growing body of research support for Merrill's First Principles of Instruction. In one study, researchers surveyed 140 students at 89 different higher education institutions and discovered that students were 9 times more likely to report that they had mastered learning the course objectives when First Principles of Instruction were used and when they spent ample time and effort studying. Another study observed award-winning instructors at an institute of higher education and found that they used some or all of First Principles of Instruction in their teaching strategies, thereby linking acclaimed instructors with the principles. In another study, researchers compared the effectiveness of instruction using First Principles of Instruction with more traditional instruction and found that students in the First Principles group learned significantly more and finished learning tasks significantly faster. Another study found that biology students learning from instruction using First Principles of Instruction had significantly increased confidence in their ability to solve similar problems in the future, compared to other learners.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11182", "title": "Funeral", "text": "Funeral\n\nA funeral is a ceremony connected with the burial, cremation, or interment of a corpse, or the burial (or equivalent) with the attendant observances. Funerary customs comprise the complex of beliefs and practices used by a culture to remember and respect the dead, from interment, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in their honor. Customs vary between cultures and religious groups. Common secular motivations for funerals include mourning the deceased, celebrating their life, and offering support and sympathy to the bereaved; additionally, funerals may have religious aspects that are intended to help the soul of the deceased reach the afterlife, resurrection or reincarnation.\n\nThe funeral usually includes a ritual through which the corpse receives a final dispositon. Depending on culture and religion, these can involve either the destruction of the body (for example, by cremation or sky burial) or its preservation (for example, by mummification or interment). Differing beliefs about cleanliness and the relationship between body and soul are reflected in funerary practices. A memorial service or celebration of life is a funerary ceremony that is performed without the remains of the deceased person.\n\nThe word \"funeral\" comes from the Latin \"funus\", which had a variety of meanings, including the corpse and the funerary rites themselves. Funerary art is art produced in connection with burials, including many kinds of tombs, and objects specially made for burial like flowers with a corpse.\n\nFuneral rites are as old as human culture itself, pre-dating modern \"Homo sapiens\" and dated to at least 300,000 years ago. For example, in the Shanidar Cave in Iraq, in Pontnewydd Cave in Wales and at other sites across Europe and the Near East, archaeologists have discovered Neanderthal skeletons with a characteristic layer of flower pollen. This deliberate burial and reverence given to the dead has been interpreted as suggesting that Neanderthals had religious beliefs, although the evidence is not unequivocal – while the dead were apparently buried deliberately, burrowing rodents could have introduced the flowers.\n\nSubstantial cross-cultural and historical research document funeral customs as a highly predictable, stable force in communities. Funeral customs tend to be characterized by five \"anchors\": significant symbols, gathered community, ritual action, cultural heritage, and transition of the dead body (corpse).\n\nFunerals in the Bahá'í Faith are characterized by not embalming, a prohibition against cremation, using a chrysolite or hardwood casket, wrapping the body in silk or cotton, burial not farther than an hour (including flights) from the place of death, and placing a ring on the deceased's finger stating, \"I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate.\" The Bahá'í funeral service also contains the only prayer that's permitted to be read as a group - congregational prayer, although most of the prayer is read by one person in the gathering. The Bahá'í decedent often controls some aspects of the Bahá'í funeral service, since leaving a will and testament is a requirement for Bahá'ís. Since there is no Bahá'í clergy, services are usually conducted under the guise, or with the assistance of, a Local Spiritual Assembly.\n\nA Buddhist funeral marks the transition from one life to the next for the deceased. It also reminds the living of their own mortality.\n\nChristian burials typically occur on consecrated ground. Burial, rather than a destructive process such as cremation, was the traditional practice amongst Christians, because of the belief in the resurrection of the body. Cremations later came into widespread use, although some denominations forbid them. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops said \"The Church earnestly recommends that the pious custom of burying the bodies of the deceased be observed; nevertheless, the Church does not prohibit cremation unless it was chosen for reasons contrary to Christian doctrine\" (canon 1176.3).\n\nCongregations of varied denominations perform different ceremonies, but most involve offering prayers, scripture reading from the Bible, a sermon, homily, or eulogy, and music. One issue of concern as the 21st century began was with the use of secular music at Christian funerals, a custom generally forbidden by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nAntyesti, literally \"last rites or last sacrifice\", refers to the rite-of-passage rituals associated with a funeral in Hinduism. It is sometimes referred to as \"Antima Samskaram\", \"Antya-kriya\", \"Anvarohanyya\", or \"Vahni Sanskara\".\n\nA dead adult Hindu is cremated, while a dead child is typically buried. The rite of passage is said to be performed in harmony with the sacred premise that the microcosm of all living beings is a reflection of a macrocosm of the universe. The soul (Atman, Brahman) is believed to be the immortal essence that is released at the \"Antyeshti\" ritual, but both the body and the universe are vehicles and transitory in various schools of Hinduism. They consist of five elements: air, water, fire, earth and space. The last rite of passage returns the body to the five elements and origins. The roots of this belief are found in the Vedas, for example in the hymns of Rigveda in section 10.16, as follows,\n\nThe final rites of a burial, in case of untimely death of a child, is rooted in Rig Veda's section 10.18, where the hymns mourn the death of the child, praying to deity Mrityu to \"neither harm our girls nor our boys\", and pleads the earth to cover, protect the deceased child as a soft wool.\n\nAmong Hindus, the dead body is usually cremated within a day of death. The body is washed, wrapped in white cloth for a man or a widow, red for a married woman, the two toes tied together with a string, a \"Tilak\" (red mark) placed on the forehead. The dead adult's body is carried to the cremation ground near a river or water, by family and friends, and placed on a pyre with feet facing south. The eldest son, or a male mourner, or a priest then bathes before leading the cremation ceremonial function. He circumambulates the dry wood pyre with the body, says a eulogy or recites a hymn in some cases, places sesame seed in the dead person's mouth, sprinkles the body and the pyre with ghee (clarified butter), then draws three lines signifying \"Yama\" (deity of the dead), \"Kala\" (time, deity of cremation) and the dead. The pyre is then set ablaze, while the mourners mourn. The ash from the cremation is consecrated to the nearest river or sea. After the cremation, a period of mourning is observed for 10 to 12 days after which the immediate male relatives or the sons of the deceased shave their head, trim their nails, recites prayers with the help of priest or Brahmin and invite all relatives, kins, friends and neighbours to eat a simple meal together in remembrance of the deceased. This day, in some communities, also marks a day when the poor and needy are offered food in memory of the dead.\n\nFunerals in Islam (called Janazah in Arabic) follow fairly specific rites. In all cases, however, sharia (Islamic religious law) calls for burial of the body, preceded by a simple ritual involving bathing and shrouding the body, followed by salat (prayer).\n\nBurial rituals should normally take place as soon as possible and include:\n\nThe mourning period is 40 days long.\n\nIn Judaism, funerals follow fairly specific rites, though they are subject to variation in custom. Funerals in Judaism share many features with those of Islam. Jewish religious law (\"Halakha)\" calls for preparatory rituals involving bathing and shrouding the body accompanied by prayers and readings from the Hebrew Bible, and then a funeral service marked by eulogies and brief prayers, and then the lowering of the body into the grave and the filling of the grave. Traditional law and practice forbid cremation of the body; the Reform Jewish movement generally discourages cremation but does not outright forbid it.\n\nBurial rites should normally take place as soon as possible and include:\n\nIn Sikhism death is not considered a natural process, an event that has absolute certainty and only happens as a direct result of God's Will or Hukam. To a Sikh, birth and death are closely associated, because they are both part of the cycle of human life of \"coming and going\" ( ਆਵਣੁ ਜਾਣਾ, Aana Jaana) which is seen as transient stage towards Liberation ( ਮੋਖੁ ਦੁਆਰੁ, Mokh Du-aar), complete unity with God; Sikhs believe in reincarnation.\n\nThe soul itself is not subject to the cycle of birth and death; death is only the progression of the soul on its journey from God, through the created universe and back to God again. In life a Sikh is expected to constantly remember death so that he or she may be sufficiently prayerful, detached and righteous to break the cycle of birth and death and return to God.\n\nThe public display of grief by wailing or crying out loud at the funeral (called Antam Sanskar in the Sikh culture) is discouraged and should be kept to a minimum. Cremation is the preferred method of disposal, although if this is not possible other methods such as burial, or burial at sea, are acceptable. Markers such as gravestones, monuments, etc. are discouraged, because the body is considered to be only the shell and the person's soul is their real essence.\n\nOn the day of the cremation, the body is washed and dressed and then taken to the Gurdwara or home where hymns (Shabads) from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, the Sikh Scriptures are recited by the congregation. Kirtan may also be performed by Ragis while the relatives of the deceased recite \"Waheguru\" sitting near the coffin. This service normally takes from 30 to 60 minutes. At the conclusion of the service, an Ardas is said before the coffin is taken to the cremation site.\n\nAt the point of cremation, a few more Shabads may be sung and final speeches are made about the deceased person. The eldest son or a close relative generally lights the fire. This service usually lasts about 30 to 60 minutes.\n\nThe ashes are later collected and disposed of by immersing them in the Punjab (five famous rivers in India).\n\nThe Sidaran Paath\nThe ceremony in which the Sidharan Paath is begun after the cremation ceremony, may be held when convenient, wherever the Guru Granth Sahib is present:\n\nHymns are sung from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji.\nThe first five and final verses of \"Anand Sahib,\" the \"Song of Bliss,\" are recited or sung.\nThe first five verses of Sikhism's morning prayer, \"Japji Sahib,\" are read aloud to begin the Sidharan paath.\nA hukam, or random verse, is read from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji.\nArdas, a prayer, is offered.\nPrashad, a sacred sweet, is distributed.\nLangar, a meal, is served to guests.\nWhile the Sidharan paath is being read, the family may also sing hymns daily. Reading may take as long as needed to complete the paath.\n\nThis ceremony is followed by Sahaj Paath Bhog, Kirtan Sohila, night time prayer is recited 1 week and finally Ardas called the \"Antim Ardas\" (\"Final Prayer\") is offered the last week.\n\nThe Greek word for funeral – \"kēdeía\" (κηδεία) – derives from the verb \"kēdomai\" (κήδομαι), that means attend to, take care of someone. Derivative words are also \"kēdemón\" (κηδεμών, \"guardian\") and \"kēdemonía\" (κηδεμονία, \"guardianship\"). From the Cycladic civilization in 3000BC until the Hypo-Mycenaean era in 1200–1100 BC the main practice of burial is interment. The cremation of the dead that appears around the 11th century BC constitutes a new practice of burial and is probably an influence from the East. Until the Christian era, when interment becomes again the only burial practice, both cremation and interment had been practiced depending on the area.\n\nThe ancient Greek funeral since the Homeric era included the \"próthesis\" (πρόθεσις), the \"ekphorá\" (ἐκφορά), the burial and the \"perídeipnon\" (περίδειπνον). In most cases, this process is followed faithfully in Greece until today.\n\n\"Próthesis\" is the deposition of the body of the deceased on the funereal bed and the threnody of his relatives. Today the body is placed in the casket, that is always open in Greek funerals. This part takes place in the house where the deceased had lived. An important part of the Greek tradition is the \"epicedium\", the mournful songs that are sung by the family of the deceased along with professional mourners (who are extinct in the modern era). The deceased was watched over by his beloved the entire night before the burial, an obligatory ritual in popular thought, which is maintained still.\n\n\"Ekphorá\" is the process of transport of the mortal remains of the deceased from his residence to the church, nowadays, and afterward to the place of burial. The procession in the ancient times, according to the law, should have passed silently through the streets of the city. Usually certain favourite objects of the deceased were placed in the coffin in order to \"go along with him.\" In certain regions, coins to pay Charon, who ferries the dead to the underworld, are also placed inside the casket. A last kiss is given to the beloved dead by the family before the coffin is closed.\nThe Roman orator Cicero describes the habit of planting flowers around the tomb as an effort to guarantee the repose of the deceased and the purification of the ground, a custom that is maintained until today. After the ceremony, the mourners return to the house of the deceased for the \"perídeipnon\", the dinner after the burial. According to archaeological findings–traces of ash, bones of animals, shards of crockery, dishes and basins–the dinner during the classical era was also organized at the burial spot. Taking into consideration the written sources, however, the dinner could also be served in the houses.\n\nTwo days after the burial, a ceremony called \"the thirds\" was held. Eight days after the burial the relatives and the friends of the deceased assembled at the burial spot, where \"the ninths\" would take place, a custom still kept. In addition to this, in the modern era, memorial services take place 40 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year after the death and from then on every year on the anniversary of the death. The relatives of the deceased, for an unspecified length of time that depends on them, are in mourning, during which women wear black clothes and men a black armband.\n\nIn ancient Rome, the eldest surviving male of the household, the \"pater familias\", was summoned to the death-bed, where he attempted to catch and inhale the last breath of the decedent.\n\nFunerals of the socially prominent usually were undertaken by professional undertakers called \"libitinarii\". No direct description has been passed down of Roman funeral rites. These rites usually included a public procession to the tomb or pyre where the body was to be cremated. The surviving relations bore masks bearing the images of the family's deceased ancestors. The right to carry the masks in public eventually was restricted to families prominent enough to have held \"curule magistracies\". Mimes, dancers, and musicians hired by the undertakers, and professional female mourners, took part in these processions. Less well-to-do Romans could join benevolent funerary societies (\"collegia funeraticia\") that undertook these rites on their behalf.\n\nNine days after the disposal of the body, by burial or cremation, a feast was given (\"cena novendialis\") and a libation poured over the grave or the ashes. Since most Romans were cremated, the ashes typically were collected in an urn and placed in a niche in a collective tomb called a \"columbarium\" (literally, \"dovecote\"). During this nine-day period, the house was considered to be tainted, \"funesta\", and was hung with Taxus baccata or Mediterranean Cypress branches to warn passersby. At the end of the period, the house was swept out to symbolically purge it of the taint of death.\n\nSeveral Roman holidays commemorated a family's dead ancestors, including the \"Parentalia\", held February 13 through 21, to honor the family's ancestors; and the Feast of the Lemures, held on May 9, 11, and 13, in which ghosts (\"larvae\") were feared to be active, and the \"pater familias\" sought to appease them with offerings of beans.\n\nThe Romans prohibited cremation or inhumation within the sacred boundary of the city \"(pomerium)\", for both religious and civil reasons, so that the priests might not be contaminated by touching a dead body, and that houses would not be endangered by funeral fires.\n\nRestrictions on the length, ostentation, expense of, and behaviour during funerals and mourning gradually were enacted by a variety of lawmakers. Often the pomp and length of rites could be politically or socially motivated to advertise or aggrandise a particular kin group in Roman society. This was seen as deleterious to society and conditions for grieving were set. For instance, under some laws, women were prohibited from loud wailing or lacerating their faces and limits were introduced for expenditure on tombs and burial clothes.\n\nThe Romans commonly built tombs for themselves during their lifetime. Hence these words frequently occur in ancient inscriptions, V.F. Vivus Facit, V.S.P. Vivus Sibi Posuit. The tombs of the rich usually were constructed of marble, the ground enclosed with walls, and planted around with trees. But common sepulchres usually were built below ground, and called hypogea. There were niches cut out of the walls, in which the urns were placed; these, from their resemblance to the niche of a pigeon-house, were called columbaria.\n\nWithin the United States and Canada, in most cultural groups and regions, the funeral rituals can be divided into three parts:\nvisitation, funeral, and the burial service.\nAt the \"visitation\" (also called a \"viewing\", \"wake\" or \"calling hours\"), in Christian or secular Western custom, the body of the deceased person (or decedent) is placed on display in the casket (also called a coffin, however almost all body containers are caskets). The viewing often takes place on one or two evenings before the funeral. In the past, it was common practice to place the casket in the decedent’s home or that of a relative for viewing. This practice continues in many areas of Ireland and Scotland. The body is traditionally dressed in the decedent's best clothes. In recent times there has been more variation in what the decedent is dressed in – some people choose to be dressed in clothing more reflective of how they dressed in life. The body will often be adorned with common jewelry, such as watches, necklaces, brooches, etc. The jewelry may be taken off and given to the family of the deceased prior to burial or be buried with the deceased. Jewelry has to be removed before cremation in order to prevent damage to the crematory. The body may or may not be embalmed, depending upon such factors as the amount of time since the death has occurred, religious practices, or requirements of the place of burial.\n\nThe most commonly prescribed aspects of this gathering are that the attendees sign a book kept by the deceased's survivors to record who attended. In addition, a family may choose to display photographs taken of the deceased person during his/her life (often, formal portraits with other family members and candid pictures to show \"happy times\"), prized possessions and other items representing his/her hobbies and/or accomplishments. A more recent trend is to create a DVD with pictures and video of the deceased, accompanied by music, and play this DVD continuously during the visitation.\n\nThe viewing is either \"open casket\", in which the embalmed body of the deceased has been clothed and treated with cosmetics for display; or \"closed casket\", in which the coffin is closed. The coffin may be closed if the body was too badly damaged because of an accident or fire or other trauma, deformed from illness, if someone in the group is emotionally unable to cope with viewing the corpse, or if the deceased did not wish to be viewed. In cases such as these, a picture of the deceased, usually a formal photo, is placed atop the casket.\nHowever, this step is foreign to Judaism; Jewish funerals are held soon after death (preferably within a day or two, unless more time is needed for relatives to come), and the corpse is never displayed. Torah law forbids embalming. Traditionally flowers (and music) are not sent to a grieving Jewish family as it is a reminder of the life that is now lost. The Jewish shiva tradition discourages family members from cooking, so food is brought by friends and neighbors. (\"See also Jewish bereavement.\")\n\nThe decedent's closest friends and relatives who are unable to attend frequently send flowers to the viewing, with the exception of a Jewish funeral, where flowers would not be appropriate (donations are often given to a charity instead).\n\nObituaries sometimes contain a request that attendees do not send flowers (e.g. \"In lieu of flowers\"). The use of these phrases has been on the rise for the past century. In the US in 1927, only 6% of the obituaries included the directive, with only 2.2% of those mentioned charitable contributions instead. By the middle of the century, they had grown to 14.5%, with over 54% of those noting a charitable contribution as the preferred method of expressing sympathy. Today, well over 87% of them have such a note – but those statistics vary demographically.\n\nThe viewing typically takes place at a funeral home, which is equipped with gathering rooms where the viewing can be conducted, although the viewing may also take place at a church. The viewing may end with a prayer service; in a Roman Catholic funeral, this may include a rosary.\n\nA visitation is often held the evening before the day of the funeral. However, when the deceased person is elderly the visitation may be held immediately preceding the funeral. This allows elderly friends of the deceased a chance to view the body and attend the funeral in one trip, since it may be difficult for them to arrange travel; this step may also be taken if the deceased has few survivors or the survivors want a funeral with only a small number of guests.\n\nA memorial service, often called a funeral, is often officiated by clergy from the decedent's, or bereaved's, church or religion. A funeral may take place at either a funeral home, church, or crematorium or cemetery chapel. A funeral is held according to the family's choosing, which may be a few days after the time of death, allowing family members to attend the service. This type of memorial service is most common for Christians, and Roman Catholics call it a mass when Eucharist (communion) is offered, the casket is closed and a priest says prayers and blessings. A Roman Catholic funeral must take place in a parish church (usually that of the deceased, or that of the family grave, or a parish to which the deceased had special links). Sometimes family members or friends of the dead will say something. If the funeral service takes place in the funeral home (mostly it takes place in the funeral home's chapel) it can be directed by a clergy (mostly for Protestant churches and sometimes for Catholic churches) or hosted by a very close family member most common a parent. In some traditions if this service takes place in a funeral home it is the same if it would take place in a church. These services if taking place in a funeral home consists of prayers, blessings and eulogies from the family.\n\nThe \"open-casket service\" (which is common in North America) allows mourners to have a final opportunity to view the deceased and say good-bye. There is an order of precedence when approaching the casket at this stage that usually starts with the immediate family (siblings, parents, spouse, children); followed by other mourners, after which the immediate family may file past again, so they are the last to view their loved one before the coffin is closed. This opportunity can take place immediately before the service begins, or at the very end of the service. A Roman Catholic funeral must be closed-casket, and relatives are expected to attend the few days before the service. \n\nOpen casket funerals and visitations are very rare in some countries, such as the United Kingdom and most European countries, where it is usual for only close relatives to actually see the deceased person and not uncommon for no one to do so. The funeral service itself is almost invariably closed casket. Funeral homes are generally not used for funeral services, which are almost exclusively held in a church, cemetery, or crematorium chapel.\n\nThe deceased is usually transported from the funeral home to a church in a hearse, a specialized vehicle designed to carry casketed remains. The deceased is often transported in a procession (also called a funeral cortège), with the hearse, funeral service vehicles, and private automobiles traveling in a procession to the church or other location where the services will be held. In a number of jurisdictions, special laws cover funeral processions – such as requiring most other vehicles to give right-of-way to a funeral procession. Funeral service vehicles may be equipped with light bars and special flashers to increase their visibility on the roads. They may also all have their headlights on, to identify which vehicles are part of the cortege, although the practice also has roots in ancient Roman customs. After the funeral service, if the deceased is to be buried the funeral procession will proceed to a cemetery if not already there. If the deceased is to be cremated, the funeral procession may then proceed to the crematorium.\nReligious funeral services commonly include prayers, readings from a sacred text, hymns (sung either by the attendees or a hired vocalist) and words of comfort by the clergy. Frequently, a relative or close friend will be asked to give a eulogy, which details happy memories and accomplishments rather than criticism. Sometimes the eulogy is delivered by clergy. Church bells may also be tolled both before and after the service.\n\nIn some religious denominations, for example, Roman Catholic, and Anglican, eulogies from loved ones are somewhat discouraged during this service. In such cases, the eulogy is only done by a member of the clergy. This tradition is giving way to eulogies read by family members or friends. In these religions the coffin is traditionally closed at the end of the wake and is not re-opened for the funeral service.\n\nDuring the funeral and at the burial service, the casket may be covered with a large arrangement of flowers, called a casket spray. If the deceased served in a branch of the armed forces, the casket may be covered with a national flag; however, in the US, nothing should cover the national flag according to Title 4, United States Code, Chapter 1, Paragraph 8i. If the funeral service is held in a church, the casket is normally covered in a white pall, which recalls the white garments of baptism.\n\nFuneral customs vary from country to country. In the United States, any type of noise other than quiet whispering or mourning is considered disrespectful. A traditional fire department funeral consists of two raised aerial ladders. The firefighter(s) travel under the aerials on their ride, on the fire apparatus, to the cemetery. Once there, the grave service includes the playing of bagpipes. The pipes have come to be a distinguishing feature of a fallen hero's funeral. Also a \"Last Alarm Bell\" is rung. A portable fire department bell is tolled at the conclusion of the ceremony.\n\nAt a religious burial service, conducted at the side of the grave, tomb, mausoleum or cremation, the body of the decedent is buried or cremated at the conclusion.\n\nSometimes, the burial service will immediately follow the funeral, in which case a funeral procession travels from the site of the memorial service to the burial site. In some other cases, the burial service is the funeral, in which case the procession might travel from the cemetery office to the grave site. Other times, the burial service takes place at a later time, when the final resting place is ready, if the death occurred in the middle of winter.\n\nIf the decedent served in a branch of the Armed forces, military rites are often accorded at the burial service.\n\nIn many religious traditions, pallbearers, usually males who are relatives or friends of the decedent, will carry the casket from the chapel (of a funeral home or church) to the hearse, and from the hearse to the site of the burial service. The pallbearers often sit in a special reserved section during the memorial service.\n\nMost religions expect coffins to be kept closed during the burial ceremony. In Eastern Orthodox funerals, the coffins are reopened just before burial to allow mourners to look at the deceased one last time and give their final farewells. Greek funerals are an exception as the coffin is open during the whole procedure unless the state of the body does not allow it.\nMorticians may ensure that all jewelry, including wristwatch, that were displayed at the wake are in the casket before it is buried or entombed. Custom requires that everything goes into the ground; however this is not true for Jewish services. Jewish tradition stipulates that nothing of value is buried with the deceased.\n\nIn the case of cremation such items are usually removed before the body goes into the furnace. Pacemakers are removed prior to cremation – if left in they could explode.\n\nThe family of the deceased may wish to have only a very small, private service, with just the deceased's closest family members and friends attending. This type of ceremony is not open to the public, but only to those invited.\n\nA memorial service, or a commemoration is one given for the deceased when the body is not present. The service takes place \"after\" cremation or burial at sea, after donation of the body to an academic or research institution, or after the ashes have been scattered. It is also significant when the person is missing and presumed dead, or known to be deceased though the body is not recoverable. These services often take place at a funeral home; however, they can be held in a home, school, workplace, church or other location of some significance. A memorial service may include speeches (eulogies), prayers, poems, or songs to commemorate the deceased. Pictures of the deceased and flowers are usually placed where the coffin would normally be placed.\n\nAfter the sudden deaths of important public officials, public memorial services have been held by communities, including those without any specific connection to the deceased. For examples, community memorial services were held after the assassinations of US presidents James A. Garfield and William McKinley.\n\nA good funeral (as they were called) had one draw the curtains for a period of time; at the wake, when new visitors arrived, they would enter from the front door and leave through the back door. The women stayed at home whilst the men attended the funeral, the village priest would then visit the family at their home to talk about the deceased and to console them.\n\nThe first child of William Price, a Welsh Neo-Druidic priest, died in 1884. Believing that it was wrong to bury a corpse, and thereby pollute the earth, Price decided to cremate his son's body, a practice which had been common in Celtic societies. \nThe police arrested him for the illegal disposal of a corpse. Price successfully argued in court that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal. The case set a precedent that, together with the activities of the newly-founded Cremation Society of Great Britain, led to the Cremation Act 1902. The Act imposed procedural requirements before a cremation could occur and restricted the practice to authorised places.\n\nIn Finland, religious funerals (hautajaiset) are quite ascetic. The local priest or minister says prayers and blesses the deceased in their house. The mourners (saattoväki) traditionally bring food to the mourners' house. Nowadays the deceased is put into the coffin in the place where they died. The undertaker will pick up the coffin and place it in the hearse and drive it to the funeral home, while the closest relatives or friends of the deceased will follow the hearse in a funeral procession in their own cars. The coffin will be held at the funeral home until the day of the funeral. The funeral services may be divided into two parts. First is the church service (siunaustilaisuus) in a cemetery chapel or local church, than the burial.\n\nThe majority of Italians are Roman Catholic and follow Catholic funeral traditions. Historically, mourners would walk in a funeral procession to the gravesite; today vehicles are used.\n\nIn Poland, in urban areas, there are usually two, or just one “stop”. The body, brought by a hearse from the mortuary, may be taken to a church or to a cemetery chapel,Then there is a funeral mass or service at cemetery chapel. Following the mass or Service the casket is carried in procession (usually on foot) on a hearse to the grave. Once at the gravesite, the priest will commence the graveside committal service and the casket is lowered. The mass or service usually takes place at the cemetery.\n\nIn some traditional rural areas, the wake (\"czuwanie\") takes place in the house of the deceased or their relatives. The body lies in state for three days in the house.The funeral usually takes place on the third day. Family, neighbors and friends gather and pray during the day and night on those three days and nights. There are usually three stages in the funeral ceremony (\"ceremonia pogrzebowa\", \"pogrzeb\"): the wake (\"czuwanie\"), then the body is carried by procession (usually on foot) or people drive in their own cars to the church or cemetery chapel for mass, and another procession by foot to the gravesite.\n\nAfter the funeral, families gather for a post-funeral get-together (\"stypa\"). It can be at the family home, or at a function hall. In Poland cremation is less popular because the Catholic Church in Poland doesn't allow it. Cremation is popular among non-religious and Protestants in Poland.\n\nAn old funeral rite from the Scottish Highlands involved burying the deceased with a wooden plate resting on his chest. On the plate were placed a small amount of earth and salt, to represent the future of the deceased. The earth hinted that the body would decay and become one with the earth, while the salt represented the soul, which does not decay. This rite was known as \"earth laid upon a corpse\". This practice was also carried out in Ireland, as well as in parts of England, particularly in Leicestershire, although in England the salt was intended to prevent air from distending the corpse.\n\nIn Spain, a burial or cremation may occur very soon after a death. Most Spaniards are Roman Catholics and follow Catholic funeral traditions. First, family and friends sit with the deceased during the wake until the burial. Wakes are a social event and a time to laugh and honor the dead. Following the wake comes the funeral mass (Tanatorio) at the church or cemetery chapel. Following the mass is the burial. The coffin is then moved from the church to the local cemetery, often with a procession of locals walking behind the hearse.\n\nA growing number of families choose to hold a life celebration or celebration of life event for the deceased in addition to or instead of a traditional funeral. Such ceremonies may be held outside the funeral home or place of worship; restaurants, parks, pubs and sporting facilities are popular choices based on the specific interests of the deceased. Celebrations of life focus on a life that was lived, including the person’s best qualities, interests, achievements and impact, rather than mourning a death. Some events are portrayed as joyous parties, instead of a traditional somber funeral. Taking on happy and hopeful tones, celebrations of life discourage wearing black and focus on the deceased’s individuality. An extreme example might have \"a fully stocked open bar, catered food, and even favors.\" Notable recent celebrations of life ceremonies include those for René Angélil and Maya Angelou.\n\nOriginating in New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S., alongside the emergence of jazz music in late 19th and early 20th centuries, the jazz funeral is a traditionally African-American burial ceremony and celebration of life unique to New Orleans that involves a parading funeral procession accompanied by a brass band playing somber hymns followed by upbeat jazz music. Traditional jazz funerals begin with a processional led by the funeral director, family, friends, and the brass band, i.e., the \"main line\", who march from the funeral service to the burial site while the band plays slow dirges and Christian hymns. After the body is buried, or \"cut loose\", the band begins to play up-tempo, joyful jazz numbers, as the main line parades through the streets and crowds of \"second liners\" join in and begin dancing and marching along, transforming the funeral into a street festival.\n\nThe terms \"green burial\" and \"natural burial\", used interchangeably, apply to ceremonies that aim to return the body with the earth with little to no use of artificial, non-biodegradable materials. As a concept, the idea of uniting an individual with the natural world after he or she dies appears as old as human death itself, being widespread before the rise of the funeral industry. Holding environmentally-friendly ceremonies as a modern concept first attracted widespread attention in the 1990s. In terms of North America, the opening of the first explicitly \"green\" burial cemetery in the U.S. took place in the state of South Carolina. However, the Green Burial Council, which came into being in 2005, has based its operations out of California. The instition works to officially certifies burial practices for funeral homes and cemeteries, making sure that appropriate materials are used.\n\nReligiously, some adherents of the Roman Catholic Church often have particular interest in \"green\" funerals given the faith's preference to full burial of the body as well as the theological commitments to care for the environment stated in Catholic social teaching.\n\nThose with concerns about the effects on the environment of traditional burial or cremation may be placed into a natural bio-degradable green burial shroud. That, in turn, sometimes gets placed into a simple coffin made of cardboard or other easily biodegradable material. Furthermore, individuals may choose their final resting place to be in a specially designed park or woodland, sometimes known as an \"ecocemetery\", and may have a tree or other item of greenery planted over their grave both as a contribution to the environment and a symbol of remembrance.\n\nHumanists UK organises a network of humanist funeral celebrants or officiants across England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Channel Islands and a similar network is organised by the Humanist Society Scotland. Humanist officiants are trained and experienced in devising and conducting suitable ceremonies for non-religious individuals. Humanist funerals recognise no \"afterlife\", but celebrate the life of the person who has died. In the twenty-first century, humanist funerals were held for well-known people including Claire Rayner, Keith Floyd, Linda Smith, and Ronnie Barker.\n\nIn areas outside of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland has featured an increasing number of non-religious funeral arrangements according to publications such as \"Dublin Live\". This has occurred in parallel with a trend of increasing numbers of people carefully scripting their own funerals before they die, writing the details of their own ceremonies. The Irish Association of Funeral Directors has reported that funerals without a religious focus occur mainly in more urbanized areas in contrast to rural territories. Notable secular-based funerals have been held in other nations such as the Republic of Malta, in which civil rights activist and humanist Ramon Casha had a large scale event at the Radisson Blu Golden Sands resort devoted to laying him to rest. Although such non-religious ceremonies are \"a rare scene in Maltese society\" due to the large role of the Roman Catholic Church within that country's culture, according to \"Lovin Malta\", \"more and more Maltese people want to know about alternate forms of burial... without any religion being involved.\"\n\nActual events during secular funerals vary, but they frequently reflect upon the interests and personality of the deceased. For example, the ceremony for the aforementioned Keith Floyd, a restaurateur and television personality, included a reading of Rudyard Kipling's poetic work \"If—\" and a performance by musician Bill Padley. Organizations such as the Irish Institute of Celebrants have stated that more and more regular individuals request training for administering funeral ceremonies, instead of leaving things to other individuals.\n\nCivil funerals are an alternative to religious or humanist ceremonies in the UK. Unlike a humanist funeral, a civil funeral can contain some religious content, such as hymns or reading if the family wish.\n\nFunerals specifically for fallen members of fire or police services are common in United States and Canada. These funerals involve honour guards from police forces and/or fire services from across the country and sometimes from overseas. A parade of officers often precedes or follows the hearse carrying the fallen comrade.\n\nA Masonic funeral is held at the request of a departed Mason or family member. The service may be held in any of the usual places or a Lodge room with committal at graveside, or the complete service can be performed at any of the aforementioned places without a separate committal. Freemasonry does not require a Masonic funeral.\n\nThere is no single Masonic funeral service. Some Grand Lodges (it is a worldwide organisation) have a prescribed service. Some of the customs include the presiding officer wearing a hat while doing his part in the service, the Lodge members placing sprigs of evergreen on the casket, and a small white leather apron may being placed in or on the casket. The hat may be worn because it is Masonic custom (in some places in the world) for the presiding officer to have his head covered while officiating. To Masons the sprig of evergreen is a symbol of immortality. A Mason wears a white leather apron, called a \"lambskin,\" on becoming a Mason, and he may continue to wear it even in death.\n\nIn most East Asian, South Asian and many Southeast Asian cultures, the wearing of white is symbolic of death. In these societies, white or off-white robes are traditionally worn to symbolize that someone has died and can be seen worn among relatives of the deceased during a funeral ceremony. In Chinese culture, red is strictly forbidden as it is a traditionally symbolic color of happiness. Exceptions are sometimes made if the deceased has reached an advanced age such as 85, in which case the funeral is considered a celebration, where wearing white with some red is acceptable. Contemporary Western influence however has meant that dark-colored or black attire is now often also acceptable for mourners to wear (particularly for those outside the family). In such cases, mourners wearing dark colors at times may also wear a white or off-white armband or white robe.\n\nContemporary South Korean funerals typically mix western culture with traditional Korean culture, largely depending on socio-economic status, region, and religion. In almost all cases, all related males in the family wear woven armbands representing seniority and lineage in relation to the deceased, and must grieve next to the deceased for a period of three days before burying the body. During this period of time, it is customary for the males in the family to personally greet all who come to show respect. While burials have been preferred historically, recent trends show a dramatic increase in cremations due to shortages of proper burial sites and difficulties in maintaining a traditional grave. The ashes of the cremated corpse are commonly stored in columbaria.\n\nMost Japanese funerals are conducted with Buddhist and/or Shinto rites. Many ritually bestow a new name on the deceased; funerary names typically use obsolete or archaic kanji and words, to avoid the likelihood of the name being used in ordinary speech or writing. The new names are typically chosen by a Buddhist priest, after consulting the family of the deceased. Most Japanese are cremated.\n\nReligious thought among the Japanese people is generally a blend of Shintō and Buddhist beliefs. In modern practice, specific rites concerning an individual's passage through life are generally ascribed to one of these two faiths. Funerals and follow-up memorial services fall under the purview of Buddhist ritual, and 90% Japanese funerals are conducted in a Buddhist manner. Aside from the religious aspect, a Japanese funeral usually includes a wake, the cremation of the deceased, and inclusion within the family grave. Follow-up services are then performed by a Buddhist priest on specific anniversaries after death.\n\nAccording to an estimate in 2005, 99.82% of all deceased Japanese are cremated. In most cases the cremated remains are placed in an urn and then deposited in a family grave. In recent years however, alternative methods of disposal have become more popular, including scattering of the ashes, burial in outer space, and conversion of the cremated remains into a diamond that can be set in jewelry.\n\nFuneral practices and burial customs in the Philippines encompass a wide range of personal, cultural, and traditional beliefs and practices which Filipinos observe in relation to death, bereavement, and the proper honoring, interment, and remembrance of the dead. These practices have been vastly shaped by the variety of religions and cultures that entered the Philippines throughout its complex history.\n\nMost if not all present-day Filipinos, like their ancestors, believe in some form of an afterlife and give considerable attention to honouring the dead. Except amongst Filipino Muslims (who are obliged to bury a corpse less than 24 hours after death), a wake is generally held from three days to a week. Wakes in rural areas are usually held in the home, while in urban settings the dead is typically displayed in a funeral home. Friends and neighbors bring food to the family, such as \"pancit\" noodles and \"bibingka\" cake\";\" any leftovers are never taken home by guests, because of a superstition against it. Apart from spreading the news about someone’s death verbally, obituaries are also published in newspapers. Although the majority of the Filipino people are Christians, they have retained some traditional indigenous beliefs concerning death.\n\nIn Korea, funerals are typically held for three days and different things are done in each day.\n\nThe first day: on the day a person dies, the body is moved to a funeral hall. They prepare clothes for the body and put them into a chapel of rest. Then food is prepared for the deceased. It is made up of three bowls of rice and three kinds of Korean side dishes. Also, there has to be three coins and three straw shoes. This can be cancelled if the family of the dead person have a particular religion.\n\nOn the second day the funeral director washes the body and shrouding is done. Then, a family member of the dead person puts uncooked rice in the mouth of the body. This step does not have to be done if the family has a certain religion. After putting the rice in the mouth, the body is moved into a coffin. Family members, including close relatives, of the dead person will wear mourning clothing. Typically, mourning for a woman includes Korean traditional clothes, Hanbok, and mourning for man includes a suit. The color has to be black. The ritual ceremony begins when they are done with changing clothes and preparing foods for the dead person. The ritual ceremony is different depending on their religion. After the ritual ceremony family members will start to greet guests.\n\nOn the third day, the family decides whether to bury the body in the ground or cremate the body. If they decide to bury the body in the ground, three people from the family sprinkle dirt on the coffin three times. In case of cremation, there are no specific things to be done like ground burial. The only thing needed is a jar to place burned bones in and a place to keep the jar.\n\nOther than these facts, in Korea, people who come to the funeral bring condolence money. Also, a food called Yukgaejang is served to guests oftentimes with Korean alcohol called soju.\n\nLike many other cultures, funeral practices in Mongolia are the most important rituals that they follow. They have mixed their rituals with Buddhists due to creating a new, unique way of death.\n\nFor Mongolians who are very strict when it comes to their traditions, there were three different ways of burial that families could choose from. The main one being open-air burial, and the others being cremation and embalming. There were many factors that went into deciding which funeral practice to do. These consisted of the family's social standing, the cause of death and the specific location they died at. The main people that were chosen to be embalmed were the people apart of the Lamaistic Church, by choosing this practice, they are usually buried in a sitting position. This would show that they would always be in the position of prayer. Also, more important people such as Nobles would be buried with weapons, horses and food in their coffins to help them prepare for the next world.\n\nThe coffin is built specifically designed by three to four relatives, mainly men. In order to determine how big the coffin will be, the builders bring planks to the hut that the dead is located and put together the box and the lid to go with it. The same people who help put together the coffin also help decorate the funeral. Most of this work is done after the sun goes down. With very specific instruction, they work on decorations inside the youngest daughters house. The reason for this is so the deceased is not disturbed at night.\n\nIn Vietnam, Buddhism is the most commonly practiced religion, however, most burial methods do not coincide with the Buddhist belief of cremation.\n\nThe body of the deceased is moved to a loved one’s house and placed in an expensive coffin. The body usually stays there for about three days, allowing time for people to visit and place gifts in the mouth. This stems from the Vietnamese belief that the dead should be surrounded by their family. This belief goes so far as to include superstition as well. If somebody is dying in Vietnamese culture, they are rushed home from the hospital so they can die there, because if they die away from home it is believed to be bad luck to take a corpse home.\n\nMany services are also held in the Vietnamese burial practices. One is held before moving the coffin from the home and the other is held at the burial site. After the burial of the loved one, incense is burned at the gravesite and respect is paid to all the nearby graves. Following this, the family and friends return to the home and enjoy a feast to celebrate the life of the recently departed. Even after the deceased has been buried, the respect and honor continues. For the first 49 days after the burying, the family holds a memorial service every 7 days, where the family and friends come back together to celebrate the life of their loved one. After this, they meet again on the 100th day after the death, then 265 days after the death, and finally they meet on the anniversary of the death of their loved one, a whole year later, to continue to continue to celebrate the glorious life of their recently departed.\n\nAfrican funerals are usually open to many visitors.\nThe custom of burying the dead in the floor of dwelling-houses has been to some degree prevalent on the Gold Coast of Africa. The ceremony depends on the traditions of the ethnicity the deceased belonged to. The funeral may last for as much as a week. Another custom, a kind of memorial, frequently takes place seven years after the person's death. These funerals and especially the memorials may be extremely expensive for the family in question. Cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry, may be offered and then consumed.\n\nThe Ashanti and Akan ethnic groups in Ghana typically wear red and black during funerals. For special family members, there is typically a funeral celebration with singing and dancing to honor the life of the deceased. Afterwards, the Akan hold a sombre funeral procession and burial with intense displays of sorrow. Other funerals in Ghana are held with the deceased put in elaborate \"fantasy coffins\" colored and shaped after a certain object, such as a fish, crab, boat, and even airplanes. The Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop in Teshie, named after Seth Kane Kwei who invented this new style of coffin, has become an international reference for this form of art.\n\nSome diseases, such as Ebola can be spread by funerary customs including touching the dead. However, safe burials can be achieved by following simple procedures. For example, letting relatives see the face of the dead before bodybags are closed and taking photographs, if desired, can greatly reduce the risk of infection without impacting too heavily on the customs of burial.\n\nIn Kenya funerals are an expensive undertaking. Keeping bodies in morgues to allow for fund raising is a common occurrence more so in urban areas. Some families opt to bury their dead in the countryside homes instead of urban cemeteries, thus spending more money on transporting the dead.\n\nThe first emperor of the Qin dynasty, Qin Shi Huang’s mausoleum is located in the Lintong District of Xi’an, Shaanxi Province. Qin Shi Huang’s tomb is one of the World Heritage sites in China. Its remarkable feature and size have been known as one of the most important historical sites in China. Qin Shi Huang is the first emperor who united China for the first time. The mausoleum was built in 247 BC after he became the emperor of Qin Dynasty.\n\nAncient Chinese mausoleums have unique characteristics compared to other cultures. Ancient Chinese thought that the soul remains even after death, (immortal soul) regarded funeral practices as an important tradition. From their long history, the construction of mausoleums has developed over time, creating monumental and massive ancient emperor’s tomb.\n\nArcheologists have found more than 8,000 life-sized figures resembling an army surrounding the emperor’s tomb. The primary purpose of the placement of Terracotta Army is to protect the emperor’s tomb. The figures were composed of clay and fragments of pottery. The Terracotta Army resembles the soldiers, horses, government officials, and even musicians. All of the figures were made so acutely and delicately. The arrangement and the weapons they are carrying resembled entirely to the real weapons at that time. Furthermore, their facial features weren’t identical, but with unique features and details.\n\nThe Imperial Tombs of Ming and Qing Dynasties are included as World Heritage Sites. The three Imperial Tombs of Qin Dynasty were additionally inscribed in 2000 and 2003. The three tombs were all built in the 17th century. The tombs have been constructed to praise the emperors of Qing Dynasty and their ancestors. In tradition, Chinese have followed the Feng Shui to build and decorate the interior. All of the tombs are strictly made followed by the Feng Shui theory. Harmony between the architecture and the surrounding topographical structure were seen as an integral part of nature. According to the Feng Shi theory, to build a tomb, there must be a mountain on the northern side and low land on the south. In the west and east, a river must be located.\n\nThe Imperial Tombs of Ming and Qing Dynasties clearly shows the cultural and architectural tradition that has swayed the area for more than 500 years. There is a great harmony between the surrounding nature and the architecture. In Chinese culture, the tombs were considered as a portal between the world of the living and the dead. Chinese believed that the portal would divide the soul into two parts. The half of the soul would go to heaven, and the other half would remain within the physical body.\n\nFrom about 1600 to 1914 there were two professions in Europe now almost totally forgotten. The mute is depicted in art quite frequently but in literature is probably best known from Dickens's \"Oliver Twist\". Oliver is working for Mr. Sowerberry when this conversation takes place: \"There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear... which is very interesting. He would make a delightful mute, my love\". And in \"Martin Chuzzlewit\", Moult, the undertaker, states, \"This promises to be one of the most impressive funerals...no limitation of expense...I have orders to put on my whole establishment of mutes, and mutes come very dear, Mr Pecksniff.\" The main purpose of a funeral mute was to stand around at funerals with a sad, pathetic face. A symbolic protector of the deceased, the mute would usually stand near the door of the home or church. In Victorian times, mutes would wear somber clothing including black cloaks, top hats with trailing hatbands, and gloves.\n\nThe professional mourner, generally a woman, would shriek and wail (often while clawing her face and tearing at her clothing), to encourage others to weep. These people are mentioned in ancient Greek plays, and were commonly employed throughout Europe until the beginning of the nineteenth century. The practice continues in Africa. The 2003 award-winning Philippine comedy \"Crying Ladies\" revolves around the lives of three women who are part-time professional mourners for the Chinese-Filipino community in Manila's Chinatown. According to the film, the Chinese use professional mourners to help expedite the entry of a deceased loved one's soul into heaven by giving the impression that he or she was a good and loving person, well-loved by many.\n\nHigh-ranking national figures such as heads of state, prominent politicians, military figures, national heroes and eminent cultural figures may be offered state funerals.\n\nSome cultures place the dead in tombs of various sorts, either individually, or in specially designated tracts of land that house tombs. Burial in a graveyard is one common form of tomb. In some places, burials are impractical because the groundwater is too high; therefore tombs are placed above ground, as is the case in New Orleans, Louisiana, US. Elsewhere, a separate building for a tomb is usually reserved for the socially prominent and wealthy; grand, above-ground tombs are called mausoleums. The socially prominent sometimes had the privilege of having their corpses stored in church crypts. In more recent times, however, this has often been forbidden by hygiene laws.\nBurial was not always permanent. In some areas, burial grounds needed to be reused due to limited space. In these areas, once the dead have decomposed to skeletons, the bones are removed; after their removal they can be placed in an ossuary.\n\n\"Burial at sea\" in past generations has meant the deliberate disposal of a corpse into the ocean, wrapped and tied with weights to make sure it sinks. It has been a common practice in navies and seafaring nations; in the Church of England, special forms of funeral service were added to the Book of Common Prayer to cover it. In today's generation, \"burial at sea\" may also refer to the scattering of ashes in the ocean, while \"whole body burial at sea\" refers to the entire uncremated body being placed in the ocean at great depths. Laws vary by jurisdictions.\n\nScience fiction writers have frequently extended the concept to a \"burial in space\".\n\nCremation is also an old custom; it was the usual mode of disposing of a corpse in ancient Rome (along with graves covered with heaped mounds, also found in Greece, particularly at the Karameikos graveyard in Monastiraki). Vikings were occasionally cremated in their longships, and afterwards the location of the site was marked with standing stones.\n\nSince the latter part of the twentieth century, despite the objections of some religious groups, cremation has become increasingly popular. Jewish law (\"Halakha\") forbids cremation, believing that the soul of a cremated person will be unable to find its final repose. The Roman Catholic Church forbade it for many years, but since 1963 the church has allowed it, as long as it is not done to express disbelief in bodily resurrection. The church specifies that cremated remains are either buried or entombed; they do not allow cremated remains to be scattered or kept at home. Many Catholic cemeteries now have columbarium niches for cremated remains, or specific sections for those remains. Some denominations of Protestantism allow cremation; the more conservative denominations generally do not. The Eastern Orthodox Church and Islam also forbid cremation.\n\nAmong Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and some sects of Buddhists such as those found in Japan, cremation is common.\n\nRarer forms of disposal of the dead include exposure to the elements and to scavenger animals. This includes various forms of excarnation, where the corpse is stripped of the flesh, leaving only the bones, which are then either buried or stored elsewhere, in ossuaries or tombs for example. This was done by some groups of Native Americans in protohistoric times. Ritual exposure of the dead (without preservation of the bones) is practiced by Zoroastrians in Mumbai and Karachi, where bodies are placed in \"Towers of Silence\", where vultures and other carrion-eating birds dispose of the corpses. In the present-day structures, the bones are collected in a central pit where, assisted by lime, they, too, eventually decompose. Exposure to scavenger birds (with preservation of some, but not all bones) is also practiced by some high-altitude Tibetan Buddhists, where practical considerations such as the lack of firewood and a shallow active layer seem to have led to the practice known as \"jhator\" or \"giving alms to the birds\".\n\nMummification is the drying of bodies to preserve them. The most famous practitioners were ancient Egyptians—many nobles and highly ranked bureaucrats had their corpses embalmed and stored in luxurious sarcophagi inside their funeral mausoleums. Pharaohs stored their embalmed corpses in pyramids.\n\nCannibalism has earlier been practiced post-mortem in parts of Papua New Guinea. The practice has been linked to the spread of kuru, a prion disease.\n\nPromession is a new method of disposing of the body. Patented by a Swedish company, a promession is also known as an \"ecological funeral\". Its main purpose is to return the body to soil quickly while minimizing pollution and resource consumption. It consists of separating the body from the coffin, freezing it with liquid nitrogen, vibrating it into small particles, freeze drying it, separating any metals, and placing the dry powder remains in a biodegradable casket in top soil.\n\nSome people choose to make their funeral arrangements in advance so that at the time of their death, their wishes are known to their family. However, the extent to which decisions regarding the disposition of a decedent's remains (including funeral arrangements) can be controlled by the decedent while still alive vary from one jurisdiction to another. In the United States, there are states which allow one to make these decisions for oneself if desired, for example by appointing an agent to carry out one's wishes; in other states, the law allows the decedent's next-of-kin to make the final decisions about the funeral without taking the wishes of the decedent into account.\n\nThe decedent may, in most U.S. jurisdictions, provide instructions as to the funeral by means of a last will and testament. These instructions can be given some legal effect if bequests are made contingent on the heirs carrying them out, with alternative gifts if they are not followed. This requires the will to become available in time; aspects of the disposition of the remains of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran contrary to a number of his stated wishes, which were found in a safe that was not opened until after the funeral.\n\nSome people donate their bodies to a medical school for use in research or education. Medical students frequently study anatomy from donated cadavers; they are also useful in forensic research. Some medical conditions, such as amputations or various surgeries can make the cadaver unsuitable for these purposes; in other cases the bodies of people who had certain medical conditions are useful for research into those conditions. Many medical schools rely on the donation of cadavers for the teaching of anatomy.\n\nIt is also possible to donate organs and tissue after death, for treating the sick, or for research.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16639408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16639408", "title": "Gaung baung", "text": "Gaung baung\n\nThe gaung baung ( ; , ; Shan: ; Northern Thai: เฅียนหัว ) is a traditional Burmese turban and part of the traditional attire of many ethnic groups inhabiting modern day Burma and Northern Thailand, particularly among most of the Buddhist-professing ethnic groups: the Bamar, Mon, Rakhine, Shan, and Tai Yuan peoples. The design varies from region to region, but share basic similarities that distinguish the \"gaung baung\" from the turban.\n\n\"Gaung baung\" literally means \"head wrap\" in the Burmese language. It is part of traditional ceremonial attire, worn at formal gatherings and ceremonies. The \"gaung baung\" is almost always a sign of rank, though no insignia or pattern exists to denote it. The \"gaung baung\" is more prevalent among the Arakanese and Shan ethnic groups.\n\nThe design of the modern Burmese \"gaung baung\" emerged in the mid-20th century and is called \"maung kyetthayay\" (). It is a ready-made \"gaung baung\" made of cloth wrapped in a rattan frame and can be worn like a hat is worn. In the colonial era, silk \"gaung baungs\" called \"B.A. \"gaung baung\",\" traditionally worn at graduation ceremonies, were popular.\n\nThe \"gaung baung\" is usually made of silk or cotton, depending on the rank or wealth of the owner. The older wrap versions were usually long and wide. It is put on the head in a clockwise manner, with the tongue on the left side. The tongue is the main distinguishing feature of the \"gaung baung\", and is also different from ethnic group to ethnic group.\n\nThe Burmese and Mon \"gaung baung\" tongues tend to be sloping down and rounded, while the Arakanese (Rakhine) and Shan tongues are fanned out.\n\nNowadays, most do not wear the \"gaung baung\", even to official functions. The \"gaung baung\", along with most other articles of Burmese attire, have become streamlined. Thus, most wear ready-made and woven \"gaung baung\"s which are wrapped over a rattan or wicker frame.\n\nSince the \"gaung baung\" is a ceremonial headgear, it is always for beautification. Depending on the wealth and or rank of the owner, the colour and material differ.\n\nThe Burmese and Mon wear yellow, white, grey or cream coloured \"gaung baung\"s, of either silk or cotton. The Rakhine wear pink coloured ones, while the Shan is either cream, skin or tan coloured. The Shan \"gaung baung\" is made out of rough cotton, called pin, the trademark garment of the Shan people.\n\nUsage of \"gaung baung\" has declined dramatically during the British colonization. It is only worn in official ceremonies, and social functions such as weddings.\n\nIn the Northern Hill areas, the hill tribes, such as the Lahu, Akha and Palaung still wear similar \"gaung baung\"s, but for day to day wear, and they are usually made from towels.\n\n"}

The name of the festival is most often associated with the large event held on March 31 and April 1, 2000 at the Park Plaza Castle in Boston, United States.\n\nBefore that there were two events at the now closed Big House Brewery in Albany, New York. WAMC, the local NPR affiliate, sponsored the events which were organized by Tim McEachern.\n\nThe 2000 event was a major production, organized with the help of Susan Kaup, Chris O'Brien and many volunteers.\n\nThe event began Friday night, with a swap meet / social event at the Modern Lounge in Boston's Landsdowne Street nightclub district. Drink tickets were offered at the door, and the DJ played computer-themed music (e.g., \"It's All About The Pentiums\").\n\nOn Saturday, the main event occurred at the Castle, where admission was free. The middle of the floor held the \"Email Garden\", comprising about a dozen tables with PCs running Red Hat Linux, in a wired LAN network and providing email, Web, and general Internet access. At the front of the hall was a stage, which hosted a number of invited guests, including Rob Malda of Slashdot, Eric S. Raymond, the video game cover band Everyone. The stage was also host to the final round of a Quake III tournament, held in a back room, displayed on the stage's projection screen, as well as the final round of \"Stump the Geek\", a geek trivia contest.\n\nAside from the main events, the main floor had computer workstations displaying live webcam feeds of \"satellite\" Festivals in remote locations. A live Shoutcast feed was also provided of the Boston event. A poll for \"greatest geek hero\" was also held; the official winner was Alan Turing.\n\nAccording to Science/AAAS magazine, 2,000 people attended, though the open-door free admission made an official count impossible.\n\n\n\nThe 2000 event is widely referred to as the \"first annual\" event, although McEachern organized at least one previous event named Geek Pride Festival (and/or Geek Pride Day) at a bar in Albany, New York. Some sources refer to the Boston event as the \"third\" annual.\n\nMcEachern planned another event to take place later the same year in San Francisco, but was never realized.\n\n"}

A home version of the original \"Ghost Squad\" was developed for Nintendo's Wii game console. A sequel, \"Operation GHOST\", was released in arcades in 2012.\n\nSega released \"Ghost Squad\" for the arcade in 2004. \"Ghost Squad\" features a simulated IR light gun shaped similar to the standard issue weapon the game's protagonists use. This light gun is intended to function realistically: it features a working fire selector switch, a stock, force-feedback recoil, and iron sights. To ensure that the light gun fires accurately, a 20-second \"calibration\" mode is provided in which the game adjusts for any jostling or damage to the rifle's light-emitting components.\n\n\"Ghost Squad\" features different weapons, each with its firing and reload properties (i.e. long shot splash, long reload time) which affect its difficulty of use. \"Ghost Squad\" features three semi non-linear levels with adjustable difficulty and branching choices, ranging from the jungle, a government-restricted villa, and inside an Air Force One flight. There are many sub-activities in the game, such as defusing bombs and throwing grenades to disable armor, which are accomplished via the secondary \"Action\" trigger on the gun's foregrip.\n\nThe arcade version of \"Ghost Squad\" use \"IC Cards\" to save the players customized character data, score, and provide the player with experience points, new outfits, new weapons, and increased rank. The card is available for players to purchase at some arcades. The card allows the player a maximum of 100 game and sixteen levels of difficulty. After 100 games the card must be recharged by purchasing a new card. The game also utilizes an internet ranking system, that is accessed when using a password provided by the game.\n\nMost \"Ghost Squad\" cabinets in the United States do not have card slots. However, players have immediate access to four costumes, four guns, and the first four mission levels.\n\n\"Ghost Squad Evolution\" is the arcade followup to the original \"Ghost Squad\". It was developed and published by Sega and released in 2007.\n\nIn \"Ghost Squad: Evolution\" the player is a member of Alpha Unit, or members of the “Ghost Squad”, an unofficial unit of the anti-terrorist group, Multi-Operation-Program (M.O.P.). Non-playable characters include fellow M.O.P. members consisting of the Commander, who provides radio backup and pertinent advice to the player.

As well as a special effects to suit the situation Night Vision, Flash Light for the mounted gun, and scope for sniper rifle. The gun also features an action button which is used to pull off special moves like hand-to-hand combat. As well as recoil effects on every shot fired.\n\nEach mission contains multiple routes for the player to choose. Special events occur throughout the game depending on the route chosen, such as securing hostages, bomb removal, or providing friendly cover fire. The game is broken into 3 missions with 16 total levels. All 16 can be selected from the beginning. There are 14 costumes available for character customization, however, the costumes have no effect on gameplay.

{"id": "6596958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6596958", "title": "Golden generation", "text": "Golden generation\n\nIn sport, a golden generation or golden team is an exceptionally gifted group of players of similar age, whose achievements reach or are expected to reach a level of success beyond that which their team had previously achieved. Below is a list of teams who have been referred to by the media as golden generations, most of which played in the 21st century.\n\nIt was first coined by the Portuguese sports media to refer to a group of exceptionally gifted teenage Portuguese footballers. This group of players, spearheaded by \"Golden Boy\" Luís Figo, won two Football World Youth Championships in 1989 and 1991. This group were close to retirement in the early part of the 21st century, leading the European sports media to spotlight the Golden Generation's chances of winning a senior trophy at tournaments such as UEFA Euro 2000, the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Euro 2004 (which Portugal hosted) and the 2006 World Cup.\n\nSince then, it has been used by media in many different countries, with usage spreading to other areas, for example, in rugby.\n\nBy winning the gold medal in the Americas Championship 2001, silver medal in 2002 FIBA World Championship, the gold medal in Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics, gold medal in FIBA Diamond Ball 2008, bronze medal in Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and gold medal in 2011 FIBA Americas Championship played in the city of Mar del Plata, Argentina. Resulting in Argentina reached the first position in the FIBA Men's Ranking at the end of the 2008 Olympic Games.\n\nThis Australian team waited 32 years to qualify for a FIFA World Cup tournament. This group of players formed the backbone of Australia's 2006 FIFA World Cup, 2007 AFC Asian Cup, 2010 FIFA World Cup, and 2011 AFC Asian Cup squads and was used extensively during Australia's qualification matches for those respective tournaments, with this crop of players considered to be among the best Australia have ever produced. The Golden Generation is believed to have ended during the reign of Ange Postecoglou as manager of Australia.\n\nThe current Belgium squad is considered by the media, press and fans as the best Belgium squad ever; featuring key players such as Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku, Axel Witsel, Thibaut Courtois, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, from the beginning of the tournament, Belgium were considered by many as one of the favourites to win the tournament. Belgium finished top of the group on maximum points, beating Panama, Tunisia and England. Belgium earned a famous 2–1 win over five-time champions Brazil in the quarter-finals. Belgium lost 1–0 to France in the semi-finals, but beat England in the third place play-off, Belgium's best ever result at the World Cup and best result at a major tournament since 1980.\n\nThe current Bosnia and Herzegovina national team was seen by many as the most talented generation the nation has ever had. They qualified for 2014 FIFA World Cup, their first ever World Cup since their independence and got their first ever victory against Iran on 25 June 2014.\n\nThe current Croatia team have been considered by several British media such as \"The Guardian\" as the \"Second Coming of the Golden Generation\"; in reference to the Golden Generation of Croatia from the late 1990s who won the bronze medal in at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Croatia's debut at the World Cup. The team, under the leadership of captain Luka Modrić and the style of play by key players such as Mario Mandžukić, Ivan Rakitić and Ivan Perišić, reached the 2018 FIFA World Cup final, losing to France 2–4, thus earning the silver medal. From the final onwards, however, their results continued to decline following the retirement of Mandžukić, Danijel Subasic and Vedran Corluka, and they debuted at the UEFA Nations League with a 6-0 loss to Spain in Elche. The squad were praised for their performance at the World Cup.\n\nThe Golden generation of the Czech Republic were born in the late seventies and early eighties of the twentieth century. Highlights of their generation include finishing second in UEFA Euro 1996 and third in UEFA Euro 2004. The national team was also qualified for the first time to a Fifa World Cup in 2006. During the first few years of the twenty first century the team were often ranked in the top five of the FIFA World Ranking. Czech Republic was the second best team in the world in 2005. Many of the squad during this time played in the best leagues in Europe for the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus F.C. One of them, Pavel Nedvěd, even won the Ballon d'Or in 2003. For the first time in the history of this small Central European country a Czech player won the Champions League. It happened in 2005 during \"Miracle of Istanbul.\" Milan Baroš and Vladimír Šmicer winning with Liverpool FC. \n\nDuring the reign of Sven-Göran Eriksson, Adam Crozier, the chief executive of the Football Association and some members of the British media, touted players such as David Beckham, Michael Owen and Steven Gerrard as the nucleus of a potential Golden Generation team. Despite some impressive performances such as the 2001 Germany vs England football match in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers and the individual players' successes at club level, inconsistency resulted in this group of players failing to live up to expectations, resulting in the group becoming synonymous with disappointment and failed potential.\n\nAfter Eriksson left in 2006 and Steve McClaren became manager, although many of the players continued to achieve success with their respective clubs, the team failed to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008, only the second time England failed to qualify for a major tournament in over 20 years (of the last 12 major tournaments). Rio Ferdinand claimed that the pressure of the \"Golden Generation\" tag had a negative effect on the players, restricting their ability to perform to their full potential for the national team. In 2017, Pep Guardiola said he could not understand why England did not achieve more with players such as Lampard, Carrick, Scholes, Gerrard, Terry and Ferdinand and claimed they were on the same level as Spain's golden generation of 2008–2014, The team entered a second golden generation in 2018, reaching the semi-finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup and the Finals of the UEFA Nations League, causing a resurgence of england fans and high expectations.\n\nIn late 1998 the France national football team began a period of international dominance defeating Brazil 3–0 to win the 1998 FIFA World Cup, becoming the first French team to win the World Cup. Two years later, David Trezeguet's golden goal in extra time gave France a 2–1 win over Italy to give France the 2000 European Championship. France were subsequently ranked No. 1 in the FIFA World Rankings and ranked No. 1 in the World Football Elo Ratings for two years. The team also secured the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup. Despite this impressive recent record the French team flopped at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, losing to newcomers Senegal in the opening match of the tournament and crashing out in the group stages without scoring a goal and taking only one point from their three games. A years later they were successful at the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. They also reached the World Cup final in Berlin at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to Italy. The French golden team was composed of the following players:\n\nBetween 1950 and 1956, the team recorded 42 victories, 7 draws and just one defeat, in the 1954 World Cup final against West Germany. Under the Elo rating system they achieved the highest rating recorded by a national side (2230 points, 30 June 1954).\n\nMany of these players made up the youth national teams of Portugal that won consecutive FIFA Youth Championships in 1989 and 1991. These teams were the step-up to the senior team. As a result, Portugal reached the semi-finals of 2000 UEFA European Football Championship and were runners-up four years later, on home soil. They were also 2006 FIFA World Cup semi-finalists after a dominating run, though only Luís Figo was picked in the squad for the final tournament. Some critics contend that many of the players underachieved at international level.\n\nThis generation of Spanish players helped Spain win three titles: the UEFA European Championship in 2008 and 2012 and the FIFA World Cup in 2010, while also reaching the final of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. During this time, Spain also dominated the FIFA World Rankings until 2013, having first led the rankings in 2008.\n\nYugoslavia's generation of young footballers won the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship and finished runner-up at the 1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. The nation then reached the quarter-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup and, a year later, a Red Star Belgrade team featuring many of the national team's stars became the first Yugoslav side to ever win the European Cup. Yugoslavia qualified for UEFA Euro 1992 with seven wins from eight matches and the best goalscoring record and goal difference of any team during the qualifying phase. However, the team was disqualified prior to the tournament due to the Yugoslav Wars (it was replaced by the eventual champion, Denmark) and did not play together again after the country's division. Several players from the Yugoslav team went on to finish in third place at the 1998 World Cup with Croatia.\n\nThe Algerian team which reached the second round of the 2014 FIFA World Cup has been described as a golden generation, or a \"second golden generation\" in reference to the Algerian team which reached the 1982 and 1986 World Cups and which won the 1990 African Nations Cup.\n\nDespite winning the 1992 edition of the Africa Cup of Nations, the country saw an outpour of talent during the first half of the 2000s (decade). The majority of this generation consisted of talented players who enjoyed and still enjoy considerable success in Europe. Led by Didier Drogba (who is also the national team's highest ever goalscorer), several other players found contracts in the biggest football stages in the world. During this period, Ivory Coast managed its first FIFA World Cup appearances in 2006 and 2010 respectively.. They also won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2015.\n\nThe Chile team won back to back Copa América titles in 2015 and in 2016. The backbone of this team came from the U-20 squad that went on to finish third in the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. However, in 2017 they inexplicably failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, despite most of the squad being in the primes of their careers, following unexpected losses to Bolivia and Paraguay in qualification.\n\nThe current Colombia team are considered as the \"Second Golden Generation\" of Colombia, in reference to Colombia's from the 1980s and 1990s. Under key players James Rodríguez, Juan Cuadrado and Radamel Falcao, the team reached the 2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage after topping a group featuring Greece, Ivory Coast and Japan, winning all three games. Colombia then beat Uruguay in the round of sixteen, before suffering a 1–2 defeat to host nation Brazil, in the quarter-finals. James Rodríguez was the tournament top goalscorer; and Colombia earned the FIFA Fair Play Award. At the Copa América Centenario, Colombia won third place after beating the United States 1–0. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Colombia were considered group favourites for Group H; featuring Japan, Poland and Senegal. Following a 1–2 defeat to Japan in which they went down to 10-men in under five minutes, Colombia beat Poland 3–0 and later beat Senegal 1–0 to qualify as group winners. They were knocked out by England in the round of sixteen; losing on penalties. Between June and August 2016, Colombia were ranked as 3rd in both FIFA and Elo ranking.\n\nSmith & Williamson (2016-present) \n\nKey players during this period include Richard Owen, of the Alton College Handy Hedgehogs.\n\nBorn in the mid-1980s, the Canadian national men's hockey team has had a golden generation which contributed to five consecutive IIHF World U20 Championships between 2005 and 2009, and subsequently won back-to-back gold medals at the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics, and gold at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. Eleven players have also won the Stanley Cup and four are members of the Triple Gold Club.\n\nBorn in the mid to late 1990s, the Finnish national men's hockey team has had a golden generation of young stars. Finland won the IIHF World U20 Championships in 2014 and 2016. In the 2016 NHL Draft, three of the top five picks were Finnish. \n\nBorn in the early 1970s, the Swedish national ice hockey team had a golden generation of players that achieved great success in the NHL and eventually won gold at the 2006 Winter Olympics, beating Finland with 3–2 in the gold medal game.\n\nSince 2001, Ireland's team has been chosen from a solid base of players, led by Brian O'Driscoll whose debut in 1999 has been linked to a transformation in the team's fortunes. Under-21 Triple Crown victories in 1996 and 1998 and an under-19 World Cup win in 1998 occurred with many members of those teams going on to become the golden generation of the 2000s. The senior team had only once in the 1990s won two Five Nations Championship games in one year (1995). However, the team of the 2000s were close runners-up in the expanded Six Nations Championship several times, and were disappointingly knocked out of the 2007 Rugby World Cup, failing to advance from the pool stage. Four Triple Crowns during the 2000s equaled the amount Ireland had won in the previous one hundred years. A two-win Six Nations campaign in 2008 was the exception, leading to the departure of manager Eddie O'Sullivan.\n\nTheir crowning moment came under Declan Kidney in 2009 when they won the Grand Slam and Six Nations Championship. They remained unbeaten throughout 2009, beating World and Tri Nations champions South Africa in their final match of the year. The \"Sunday Independent\" proclaimed the 2000s as \"the greatest decade in the history of Irish rugby. In the space of 10 years we have progressed from penury to riches\". Most of this group of players have also led their respective Irish club/provincial sides to unprecedented success, with Munster winning the Celtic League in 2003, 2009 and 2011 and the Heineken Cup in 2006 and 2008; and Leinster winning the Celtic League in 2002, 2008, 2013 and 2014 (as well as finishing runner up in 2010, 2011 and 2012), the Amlin Challenge Cup in 2013 and the Heineken Cup in 2009, 2011 and 2012.\n\n"}

The media still has the same purpose but the user's input adds interaction and brings interesting features to the system for better enjoyment.\n\nThe analogue videodisc developed by NV Philips was the pioneering technology for interactive media. Additionally, there are several elements that encouraged the development of interactive media including the following: \nAll of the prior elements contributed in the development of the main hardware and software systems used in interactive media.\n\nThough the word \"media\" is plural, the term is often used as a singular noun.\n\nInteractive media is related to the concepts interaction design, new media, interactivity, human computer interaction, cyberculture, digital culture, interactive design, and includes augmented reality.\n\nAn essential feature of interactivity is that it is mutual: user and machine each take an active role (see interaction). Most interactive computing systems are for some human purpose and interact with humans in human contexts. Manovich complains that 'In relation to computer-based media, the concept of interactivity is a tautology. ... Therefore, to call computer media “interactive” is meaningless – it simply means stating the most basic fact about computers.'. Nevertheless, the term is useful to denote an identifiable body of practices and technologies.\n\nInteractive media are an instance of a computational method influenced by the sciences of cybernetics, autopoiesis and system theories, and challenging notions of reason and cognition, perception and memory, emotions and affection.\n\nAny form of interface between the end user/audience and the medium may be considered interactive. Interactive media is not limited to electronic media or digital media. Board games, pop-up books, gamebooks, flip books and constellation wheels are all examples of printer interactive media. Books with a simple table of contents or index may be considered interactive due to the non-linear control mechanism in the medium, but are usually considered non-interactive since the majority of the user experience is non-interactive reading.\n\nInteractive media is helpful in the four development dimensions in which young children learn: social and emotional, language development, cognitive and general knowledge, and approaches toward learning. Using computers and educational computer software in a learning environment helps children increase communication skills and their attitudes about learning. Children who use educational computer software are often found using more complex speech patterns and higher levels of verbal communication. A study found that basic interactive books that simply read a story aloud and highlighted words and phrases as they were spoken were beneficial for children with lower reading abilities. Children have different styles of learning, and interactive media helps children with visual, verbal, auditory, and tactile learning styles.\n\nInteractive media makes technology more intuitive to use. Interactive products such as smartphones, iPad's/iPod's, interactive whiteboards and websites are all easy to use. The easy usage of these products encourages consumers to experiment with their products rather than reading instruction manuals.\n\nInteractive media promotes dialogic communication. This form of communication allows senders and receivers to build long term trust and cooperation. This plays a critical role in building relationships. Organizations also use interactive media to go further than basic marketing and develop more positive behavioral relationships.\n\nThe introduction of interactive media has greatly affected the lives and inner workings of families, with many family activities having integrated with technology quite seamlessly, allowing both children and parents to adapt to it as they see fit. However, parents have also become increasingly worried about the impact that it will have on their family lives. This is not necessarily because they are opposed to technology, but because they fear that it will lessen the time that they get to spend with their children. Studies have shown that although interactive media is able to connect families together when they are unable to physically, the dependence on this media also continues to persist even when there are opportunities for family time, which often leads the adults to believe that it distracts children more than it benefits them.\n\nThe media which allows several geographically remote users to interact synchronously with the media application/system is known as Distributed Interactive Media. Some common examples of this type of Media include Online Gaming, Distributed Virtual Environment, Whiteboards which are used for interactive conferences and many more.\n\nA couple of basic examples of interactive media (also known as a company in Azerbaijan) are video games and websites. Websites, especially social networking websites provide the interactive use of text and graphics to its users, who interact with each other in various ways such as chatting, playing online games, sharing posts that may include their thoughts and/or pictures and so forth. Video games are also one of the common examples of Interactive Media as the players make use of the joystick/controller to interactively respond to the actions and changes taking place on the game screen generated by the game application, which in turn reacts to the response of the players through the joystick/controller.\n\nInteractive media can be implemented using a variety of platforms and applications that use technology. Some examples include mobile platforms such as touch screen smartphones and tablets, as well as other interactive mediums that are created exclusively to solve a unique problem or set of problems. Interactive media is not limited to a professional environment, it can be used for any technology that responds to user actions. This can include the use of JavaScript and AJAX in web pages, but can also be used in programming languages or technology that has similar functionality.\n\nOne of the most recent innovations to use interactivity that solves a problem that individuals have on a daily basis is Delta Airlines's \"Photon Shower\". This device was developed as a collaboration between Delta Airlines and Professor Russell Foster of Cambridge University. The device is designed to reduce the effect of jet lag on customers that often take long flights across time zones. The interactivity is evident because of how it solves this problem. By observing what time zones a person has crossed and matching those to the basic known sleep cycles of the individual, the machine is able to predict when a person's body is expecting light, and when it is expecting darkness. It then stimulates the individual with the appropriate light source variations for the time, as well as an instructional card to inform them of what times their body expects light and what times it expects darkness. Growth of interactive media continues to advance today, with the advent of more and more powerful machines the limit to what can be input and manipulated on a display in real time is become virtually non-existent.\n\n\n"}

In the 16th century this misreading was incorporated into a popular satirical song, and in time many other variants developed, including \"... que deux jours avant sa mort / il était encore en vie\" (\"... that two days before his death / he was still quite alive\") and \"... et quand il était tout nu, / il n'avait point de chemise\"\n(\"... and when he was stark naked / he didn't wear a shirt\").\n\nIn the early 18th century Bernard de la Monnoye collected over 50 of these humorous \"La Palice\" quatrains, and published them as a burlesque Song of La Palice. From that song came the French term \"lapalissade\" meaning an utterly obvious truth—i.e. a truism or tautology, and it was borrowed into several other languages. Since that day, when you say something very obvious, your interlocutor answers : \"La Palice would have said as much !\" (in French : \"La Palice en aurait dit autant !\").\n\nIn Spanish culture, an analog is a folkloric character (Perogrullo) with his \"perogrulladas\": \"Verdad de Pedro Grullo, que a la mano cerrada, la llama puño\" (The truth of Pedro Grullo, when his hand is closed, he calls it a fist).\n\nIn English, one might reference \"Captain Obvious\" as having spoken a self-evident truth.

This distinguishes them from literary techniques, or non-universal features of literature that accompany the construction of a particular work rather than forming the essential characteristics of all narrative. For example, plot, theme, character and tone are literary elements, whereas figurative language, irony, or foreshadowing would be considered literary techniques.\n\nLiterary elements aid in the discussion of and understanding of a work of literature as basic categories of critical analysis; literary elements could be said to be produced by the readers of a work just as much as they are produced by its author. For the most part, they are popular concepts that are not limited to any particular branch of literary criticism, although they are most closely associated with the formalist method of professional literary criticism. There is no official definition or fixed list of terms of literary elements; however, they are a common feature of literary education at the primary and secondary level, and a set of terms similar to the one below often appears in institutional student evaluation.

{"id": "28070283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28070283", "title": "Museum anthropology", "text": "Museum anthropology\n\nMuseum anthropology is a domain of scholarship and professional practice in the discipline of anthropology.\n\nA distinctive characteristic of museum anthropology is that it cross-cuts anthropology's sub-fields (archaeology, cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, biological anthropology) as these are understood in North American anthropology. All of these areas are sometimes pursued in museum contexts (usually on the basis of research work with systematic collections) and all can be (and are) explicated in museum-based exhibitions and public programs. Some museum anthropologists work full or part-time in museum contexts while others are anthropologists (employed in diverse settings) interested in studying museums as social institutions in cultural and historical context. These two sets of concerns—collections-based scholarship and the study of museums—provide the core around which the domain of museum anthropology has self-organized.\n\nOne theme prominent in recent museum anthropology research concerns reconnecting older collections of ethnographic objects curated in museum contexts with the present-day source communities from which these objects were gathered. Another concern is the development of museums and cultural centers by indigenous peoples in their own home communities.\n\nThere is much traffic between museum anthropology and the related, overlapping, and neighboring domains of (general) archaeology, museum folklore, material culture studies, historical anthropology, visual anthropology, the anthropology of art, and the history of anthropology, as well as the art history of non-western societies and the field of museum studies.\n\nThe journals \"Museum Anthropology\", \"Journal of Museum Ethnography\", \"Gradhiva\", and \"Museum Anthropology Review\" are closely identified with museum anthropology as a field.\n\nDrawing upon critiques of ethnographic representation in written genres, museum anthropologists have asked questions about the strategies used to represent histories and cultures in museum exhibitions and related forms of display (such as worlds fairs). Related is historical work in which museum anthropologists seek to better understand the contexts, histories and biographies that shaped both the field and the collections that contemporary curators steward. Such historical concerns in turn intersect with work addressing repatriation claims and broader cultural property issues as these relate to museums.\n\nUse of museum collections as a resource for research aimed at understanding ethnographic and culture historical questions in the lives of particular communities has long been the core motivation for collecting by anthropology museums. Such work has been central throughout the history of the field, but new developments in digital technologies (and the rise of the so-called digital humanities) together with the transformations that have motivated the new research interests just mentioned have generated an intensification of such work. A general revitalization of material culture studies is a further factor conditioning the renewal of collections-based research in the present period. The fruits of this work include new digital archives and databases, as well as published studies focusing on particular groups, object forms, and collections.\n\nProfessional organizations central to the museum anthropology domain include the Council for Museum Anthropology (a section of the American Anthropological Association) in the United States and the Museum Ethnographers Group in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and in North America, most universities that possess both anthropology degree programs and campus-based museums of anthropology will also offer specific training and coursework in museum anthropology. Specialized training for graduate students in collections-based research in museum anthropology (focusing on ethnographic rather than archaeological, biological, or linguistics collections) is provided in the Smithsonian Institution's Summer Institute in Museum Anthropology (SIMA), an initiative funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation.\n\nProminent figures in the history of museum anthropology include:\n\n"}

It does not archive every single posting ever made to the newsgroup; rather, the maintainers of the web site have selected various messages for display that are seen as presenting factual information about the Holocaust; or, in the case of some posters, about the authors of the messages themselves.\n\nIn addition to providing an extensive archive of documents regarding the Holocaust, including the transcripts of the 1st Nuremberg Tribunal, the Nizkor Project also seeks to expose the activities of Holocaust deniers themselves. Based on the postings to the newsgroup over the years, it has compiled extensive writings from self-proclaimed revisionists, including David Irving, Ernst Zündel, Michael A. Hoffman II, and others.\nAmong the various pieces of information stored at Nizkor is a sound recording of an answering machine message allegedly made by white supremacist Tom Metzger, encouraging various individuals to \"take action\" against \"Zinkor on the Internet.\"\n\nIn 2009, the Simon Wiesenthal Center congratulated the NIZKOR who was one of those that initiated the effort that lead to the successful prosecution of three NAZI war criminal. \n\nHolocaust denial Web sites and spokespersons have made repeated accusations against McVay, challenging his neutrality and attacking him personally. The Nizkor web site has been accused by self-proclaimed \"Holocaust revisionists\" and neo-Nazi Web sites as being funded by Israel and other Zionist sources, though McVay consistently denies these charges. He states that the Nizkor Project is funded solely by donations from the general public, as well as his own personal finances.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Simon Wiesenthal Center criticized the Nizkor Project for increasing the visibility of hate groups and Holocaust deniers, even as it sought to debunk them. This debate between free speech advocates such as McVay and those who favor the suppression of speech with hate crime laws continued throughout the late 1990s, but has now mostly been resolved with the two sides agreeing on the common goal of confronting holocaust deniers and keeping their disagreements over specific tactics private. In 1996, McVay spoke out against Internet hate crime laws in Canada in front of a committee of the Canadian Parliament, stating that it is better to address the false claims of Holocaust deniers, rather than to censor them.\n\n"}

In the Oxford Program, every minute is a ‘teaching moment’ and every action, attitude and interaction is undergirded with an unwavering commitment to each child as a unique and delightful individual; an individual that should be guided through an exciting, sequential journey of self-discovery and personal creativity, as they develop a sense of character, good judgment, and positive self-worth while building foundational language and mathematical skills in an environment rich in social development.\n\nThe Oxford Development Preschool Program was founded in Great Britain in the early 1980s, as part of a growing recognition that lifelong character traits and social skills are inculcated in the earliest years of childhood development. Drawing on the ground-breaking insights of the Oxford Preschool Research Project, the Program began with the hope that every child's first five years might be put to their fullest use towards the goals of lifelong physical, emotional, spiritual and relational health along with personal contentment, self-awareness discipline, a strong moral character and a sense of community responsibility.\n\nThe activities and daily schedule of the Oxford Preschool Developmental Program optimize sensory, motor, perceptual, language and mathematical skill advancement and enhancement through child-centered, active, creative involvement. In the Oxford Program, the process as is important as the product, therefore, children learn through a meaningful symmetry of projects and activities balancing teacher-directed structure and free choice, reinforced through repetition.\n\nFundamental to the Oxford Preschool Developmental Program is respect for each child as an individual and an understanding of the uniqueness of every family situation and structure. An Oxford Developmental Preschool seeks to work as a ‘team’ with parents and guardians to create a consistent and dynamic developmental synthesis between home and school so that each child – beginning at their stage of development and progressing without anxiety or pressure – will attain their greatest potential while developing a love and excitement for learning.\n\nThe Oxford Preschool Developmental Program fosters a sense of security and consistency as essentials for healthy emotional, social and mental development, therefore, all activities and schedule follow an easily understood, child-centered, gently teacher-directed sequence. Children are guided through a wide range of interconnection, ‘hands-on’ activities and encouraged to use their personal creativity and curiosity in focused Discovery Centers.\n\nIn Life Discovery Centers, children are introduced to nature (and in the growing months, to outdoor vegetable and flower gardens); in the Arts and Crafts Center, children are free to experiment and create within a safe and encouraging space; in the Mathematics Center, some puzzles, games and manipulatives stimulate cognitive development through play and interaction; and, in the Home and Health Center, children learn household safety, housekeeping and healthy habits through dramatic play.\n\nThe Oxford Preschool Developmental Program is committed to an intentional, focused and individually sensitive effort to instill in the child entrusted to their care core universal, ethical values such integrity, honesty, fairness, responsibility, and respect for themselves and for others. Following the model of sequential, experiential learning, the school calendar has followed themes that guide, teach and reinforce a logical synthesis of character qualities and cognitive and social development.\n"}

Books and services relating to the PT idea have been a staple of companies that specialise in marketing offshore financial services, tax avoidance schemes, and personal privacy services.\n\nThe perpetual traveler idea proposes that individuals live in such a way that they are not considered a legal resident of any of the countries in which they spend time or operate. By lacking a legal permanent residence status, the theory goes, they may avoid the legal obligations which accompany residency, such as income and asset taxes, social security contributions, jury duty, and military service. The idea has been described as a \"late capitalist nomadism\".\n\nThe perpetual traveler idea has been presented in terms of flag theory, wherein each flag represents one of the legal jurisdictions under which the perpetual traveller operates. The Three Flags Theory is credited to investment pundit Harry D. Schultz, who proposed that everyone should have a second passport and an address in a tax haven and that their assets should be kept outside their home country. The idea was later expanded to Five Flags to include a place where money was earned and a place for recreation.\n\nWhether to minimize governmental interference (via taxes or otherwise), or to maximize privacy, the theory proposes that each of the following should be in a separate country:\n\n\nIn 1995, financial commentator Bob Beckman commented about his residence in Monaco: \"A long time ago, I was told that the most efficient way for an individual to handle his affairs was to work one place, keep his money in a second place and live in a third place. I live in Monaco. I don't work here, my money is placed elsewhere, but managed from here.\"\n\nHarry Schultz's ideas were picked up by Scope International Limited of Waterlooville, England (not related to Scope International owned by Standard Chartered Bank), who popularized the idea through a series of books they published under the name of W.G. Hill (William G. Hill) (possibly a pseudonym) in the 1980s and 90s which were sold through classified advertising in \"The Times\". Around 1989, they published \"PT: A coherent plan for a stress-free, healthy and prosperous life without government interference, taxes or coercion\" by Hill which was said to have been \"inspired and edited by Harry Donald Schultz\" and went through up to seven editions. In 1993, they published \"PT2: The practice: freedom and privacy tactics: A reference handbook\" by Hill which also went through several editions. Other books published by Scope and said to have been written by Hill include \"Banking in silence\", \"The Monaco report\" and \"Think like a tycoon\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2991026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2991026", "title": "Piblokto", "text": "Piblokto\n\nPiblokto, also known as pibloktoq and Arctic hysteria, is a condition most commonly appearing in Inughuit (Greenlandic Inuit) societies living within the Arctic Circle. Piblokto is a culture-specific hysterical reaction in Inuit, especially women, who may perform irrational or dangerous acts, followed by amnesia for the event. Piblokto may be linked to repression of the personality of Inuit women. The condition appears most commonly in winter. It is considered to be a form of a culture-bound syndrome, although more recent studies (see \"Skepticism\" section) question whether it exists at all. Piblokto is also part of the glossary of cultural bound syndromes found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).\n\nPiblokto was first documented in 1892 and reports by European explorers describe the phenomenon as common to all Arctic regions. Explorers were the first to notice piblokto. Among these, Admiral Robert Peary provided a detailed look into the disorder during an expedition to Greenland. The acts Peary and his men witnessed among the Inuit women provided entertainment, and, having sent the women's male counterparts out on missions, Peary's men reaped the sexual benefits of being the only males present. Piblokto is not limited to the indigenous people; reports of stranded sailors during the 1800s exhibiting the same symptoms have been found. The disorder is said to have existed before Western contact and still occurs today. However, as discussed below, many scholars now hold that culture bound disorders may often be an artifact of colonial encounters, and contemporary discussions of piblokto in medical anthropology and cross-cultural psychiatry consider it to be an example of the suspect nature of culture bound syndromes.\n\nPiblokto is most often found but not confined to the Inughuit culture in the polar regions of northern Greenland. Similar symptoms have been reported in European sailors stranded in Arctic regions in the 1800s. Among the Inughuit, the attacks are not considered out of the ordinary. No native theory of the disorder is currently reported. This condition is most often seen in Inughuit women. Piblokto is most common during long Arctic nights.\n\nPiblokto is an abrupt dissociative episode with four phases: social withdrawal, excitement, convulsions and stupor, and recovery.\n\nAlthough there is no known cause for piblokto, Western scientists have attributed the disorder to the lack of sun, the extreme cold, and the desolate state of most villages in the region. A reason for this disorder present in this culture may be due to the isolation of their cultural group.\n\nThis culture-bound syndrome is possibly linked to vitamin A toxicity (hypervitaminosis A). The native Inughuit diet or Eskimo nutrition provides rich sources of vitamin A through the ingestion of livers, kidneys, and fat of arctic fish and mammals and is possibly the cause or a causative factor. This causative factor is through the disturbance that has been reported for males, females, adults, children, and dogs. The ingestion of organ meats, particularly the livers of some Arctic mammals, such as the polar bear and bearded seal, where the vitamin is stored in toxic quantities, can be fatal to most people.\n\nInughuit tradition states that it is caused by evil spirits possessing the living. Shamanism and animism are dominant themes in Inughuit traditional beliefs with the angakkuq (healer) acting as a mediator with the supernatural forces. Angakkuit use trance states to communicate with spirits and carry out faith healing. There is a view among the Inughuit that individuals entering trance states should be treated with respect given the possibility of a new \"revelation\" emerging as a result. Treatment in piblokto cases usually involves allowing the episode to run its course without interference. While piblokto can often be confused with other conditions, (including epilepsy) in which failure to intervene can lead to the victim coming to harm, most cases tend to be more typical.\n\nAlthough piblokto has a place in the historical record and official medical canons, a number of Arctic researchers and Arctic residents doubt its existence. The phenomena, they suggest, may be more rooted in the experience and behavior of the early European explorers than the Inuit themselves.\n\nIn 1988 Parks Canada historian Lyle Dick began a substantial challenge to the concept that piblokto exists at all. Dick examined the original records of the European Arctic explorers, and ethnographic and linguistic reports on Inughuit societies, and discovered that not only is the majority of academic speculation into piblokto based on reports of only eight cases, but the word \"piblokto\" / \"pibloktoq\" does not exist within Inuktun (the Inughuit language); possibly, Dick concluded, this may have been the result of errors in phonetic transcription. In a 1995 paper published in the journal \"Arctic Anthropology\", and in his 2001 book \"Muskox land: Ellesmere Island in the Age of Contact\", Dick suggests that piblokto is a \"phantom phenomenon\", arising more from the Inuhuit reaction to European explorers in their midst.\n\nSimilarly, Hughes and Simons have described piblokto as a \"catch-all rubric under which explorers lumped various Inuhuit anxiety reactions, expressions of resistance to patriarchy or sexual coercion, and shamanistic practice\". Simply put, rather than understanding piblokto as a strange cultural phenomenon, some critical scholars now understand it to be an expression of trauma of colonial violence, including rape. For example, transcultural psychiatry scholars Lawrence Kirmayer and Harry Minas write: \n\n″Most comprehensive psychiatric texts mention pibloktoq\nas a culture-bound syndrome characterized by sudden wild and erratic\nbehaviour. Recently, the historian Lyle Dick collected all the published accounts\nof pibloktoq, of which there are only about 25. It seems that psychiatric\ncase description transformed a situation of sexual exploitation of Inuit\nwomen by explorers into a discrete disorder worthy of a new diagnostic\nlabel. With hindsight, we can see how insensitivity to the impact of exploration\non other peoples distorted the picture when vital information on\nsocial context was not included. The legacy of these colonialist blinkers is\nstill with us. . .″ \n\n"}

It was created after the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence. The first festival was held in 2009, and featured actress Vanessa Redgrave as the host. In 2015, the festival was cancelled due to a cut in funding by the Ministry of Culture of Kosovo. The 7th edition of the festival, which was scheduled to take place from 24 April to 1 May, was thus instead held in Tirana, Albania on 24 and 25 April and renamed to \"PriFest in Exile\".\n\nAfter its independence in 2008, Kosovo looked for ways to promote its cultural and artistic image. Vjosa Berisha \"designed a project on promoting Kosovo internationally and build a better image for Kosovo.\" The project became PriFilmFest; Berisha served as an artistic director. The organizers submitted a proposal for the festival for June 2009, with actress Vanessa Redgrave serving as the Chairman of the Board. It was rescheduled to September. , it has become one of five active Kosovar film festivals that have emerged from 2002.\n\nPriFilmFest posted that its mission was \"to open doors of the newest country in the world, Kosovo, to welcome different cultures of the world through cinema, using it as a medium to promote open dialog between cultures and nations.\" It brought in international directors and producers, and promotes Kosovar films. Its organizers have stated that Kosovo should not be known solely for political events, but for its culture. Berisha stated that PriFilmFest was inspired by the Sarajevo Film Festival, which had \"branded the city internationally.\"\n\nAs part of the event, the winners would each receive a statue called the Golden Goddess, which was based on \"Goddess of the throne\", a terracotta figure from the Neolithic period that was discovered in Kosovo in 1960, and had become the city's symbol.\n\nThe PriFilmFest founders are: Vjosa Berisha, Orhan Kerkezi, Fatos Berisha, and Faton Hasimja.\n\nStarting with the second edition in 2010, the PriFilmFest launched a co-production group called PriFilm Forum. It consisted of seminars, workshops, and discussions designed to connect Kosovar filmmakers with those in neighboring countries. The two-day workshop in 2010 brought together filmmakers from Kosovo, Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia; they listened to presentations from co-production professionals, including EAVE (European Audio-Visual Entrepreneurs), Medienboard (German Film Fund), and Robert Bosch Stiftung. Producers and filmmakers from Bosnia, Croatia and Bulgaria shared their experiences.\n\nThe first edition ran from 22 September to 30 September 2009. The slogan for the first edition was \"The beginning...\", which referenced Humphrey Bogart's \"Casablanca\" quote: “This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.” Actress Vanessa Redgrave, who had worked on many charitable causes in Kosovo, hosted the event. Berisha stated that Kosovo was trying to host events that shift media attention from politics, and that the movies in the competition include entries from the Balkans, Germany, UK and Afghanistan. The show opened with the world premiere of Gjergj Xhuvani's \"\".\nThe event included both competition and non-competition films. Six awards were presented. The event only screened one Kosovar film: \"Across the Road\" by Yll Citaku. However, the film was not qualified for the competition section, because it had been filmed in digital camera format. The festival also fostered discussion among the filmmakers and the audience on how to help filmmaking in Kosovo.\n\nThe following people served as the jurors for the festival.\n\nSource: PriFilmFest website and Southeast Europe website.\nThe second edition ran from 22 September to 29 September 2010. Italian actor Franco Nero attended. Eva Orner, who won an Oscar for the documentary \"Taxi to the Dark Side\", opened the event, and chaired the jury. The festival included special screenings of Samuel Maoz's \"Lebanon\", Roman Polanski's \"The Ghost Writer\", Franco Nero's \"Angelus Hiroshimae\", Goran Paskaljević's \"Honeymoons (Medeni mesec)\", and Jan Verheyen's \"Dossier K\". Ten medium-length films were also presented. The Italian Embassy presented \"The Italian Retrospective\" which included five films from director Gianni Amelio.\n\nThe slogan for the festival was changed to \"Friendship continues...\"\n\nThe third edition of the festival was held from 24 September to 1 October 2011. It opened with \"The Forgiveness of Blood\", a film by American director Joshua Marston, and finished at the Square 21 with a red carpet gala. The president of the jury was Gedeon Burkhard (\"Inglourious Basterds\"), who had also submitted a medium-length film called \"Bridges\".\n\nThe slogan for the third edition was changed to \"Friendship. Forever.\"\n\nThe second edition of PriFilm Forum was held on 25 and 26 September, connecting worldwide directors and producers with those in Kosovo. Presenters included Sarah Calderon (Karma Films), Satu Elo (EAVE), Bernd Buder (Berlin International Film Festival), Roshanak Behesht Nedjad (Flying Moon), David Grumbach (French filmmaker), and Elma Tataragic (Program Selector, Sarajevo Film Festival).\n\nSource: PriFilmFest website.\nThe fourth edition was held from 24 September to 1 October 2012.\nThe jury for the fourth edition were divided into four groups:\n\nSource: PriFest website.\n"}

Most public aquariums feature tanks larger than those kept by home aquarists, as well as smaller tanks. Since the first public aquariums were built in the mid-19th century, they have become popular and their numbers have increased. Most modern accredited aquariums stress conservation issues and educating the public.\n\nThe first public aquarium was opened in London Zoo in May 1853; the \"Fish House\", as it came to be known, was constructed much like a greenhouse. P.T. Barnum quickly followed in 1856 with the first American aquarium as part of his established Barnum's American Museum, which was located on Broadway in New York City before it burned down. In 1859, the Aquarial Gardens were founded in Boston. A number of aquariums then opened in Europe, such as the Jardin d'Acclimatation in Paris and the Viennese Aquarium Salon (both founded 1860), the Marine Aquarium Temple as part of the Zoological Garden in Hamburg (1864), as well as aquariums in Berlin (1869) and Brighton (1872).\n\nThe old Berlin Aquarium opened in 1869.\nThe building site was to be \"Unter den Linden\" (along a major avenue), in the centre of town, not at the Berlin Zoo.\nThe aquarium's first director, Alfred Brehm, former director of the Hamburg Zoo from 1863 to 1866, served until 1874.\nWith its emphasis on education, the public aquarium was designed like a grotto, part of it made of natural rock. The \"Geologische Grotte\" depicted \"the strata of the earth's crust\". The grotto also featured birds and pools for seals.\nThe Aquarium \"Unter den Linden\" was a three-story building. Machinery and water tanks were on the ground floor, aquarium basins for the fish on the first floor. Because of Brehm's special interest in birds, a huge aviary, with cages for mammals placed around it, was located on the second floor.\nThe facility closed in 1910.\n\nThe Artis aquarium at Amsterdam Zoo was constructed inside a Victorian building in 1882, and was renovated in 1997.\nAt the end of the 19th century the Artis aquarium was considered state-of-the-art, as it was again at the end of the 20th century.\n\nPrior to its closing on September 30, 2013, the oldest American aquarium was the National Aquarium in Washington, D.C., founded in 1873. This was followed by the opening of other public aquariums: San Francisco (Woodward's Gardens, 1873–1890), Woods Hole (Woods Hole Science Aquarium, 1885), New York (New York Aquarium, 1896–present), La Jolla (Scripps, 1903), Honolulu (Waikiki Aquarium, 1904–present), Detroit (Belle Isle Aquarium, 1904–2005, 2012–Present), Philadelphia (Philadelphia Aquarium, 1911–1962), San Francisco (Steinhart Aquarium, 1923), Chicago (Shedd Aquarium, 1929). For many years, the Shedd Aquarium was the largest aquarium in the United States until the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta opened 2005. \nEntertainment and aquatic circus exhibits were combined as themes in Philadelphia's Aquarama Aquarium Theater of the Sea (1962–1969) and Camden's re-invented Adventure Aquarium 2005, formerly the New Jersey State Aquarium (1992).\n\nThe first Japanese public aquarium, a small freshwater aquarium, was opened at the Ueno Zoo in 1882.\n\nIn 2005, the Georgia Aquarium, with more than 8 million U.S. gallons (6.7 million imp gal; 30 million L) of marine and fresh water, and more than 100,000 animals of 500 different species opened in Atlanta, Georgia. The aquarium's notable specimens include whale sharks and beluga whales.\n\nModern aquarium tanks can hold millions of litres of water and can house large species, including dolphins, sharks or beluga whales. This is accomplished through thick, clear acrylic glass windows. Aquatic and semiaquatic mammals, including otters, and seals are often cared for at aquariums. Some establishments, such as the Oregon Coast Aquarium or the Monterey Bay Aquarium, have aquatic aviaries.\nModern aquariums also include land animals and plants that spend time in or near the water.\n\nFor marketing purposes, many aquariums promote special exhibits, in addition to their permanent collections. Some have aquatic versions of a petting zoo. The Monterey Bay Aquarium has a shallow tank filled with common types of rays which visitors are encouraged to touch. The South Carolina Aquarium lets visitors feed the rays in their Saltmarsh Aviary exhibit.\n\nMost public aquariums are located close to the ocean, for a steady supply of natural seawater. An inland pioneer was Chicago's Shedd Aquarium that received seawater shipped by rail in special tank cars. The early (1911) Philadelphia Aquarium, built in the city's disused water works, had to switch to treated city water when the nearby river became too contaminated. Similarly, the recently opened Georgia Aquarium filled its tanks with fresh water from the city water system and salinated its salt water exhibits using the same commercial salt and mineral additives available to home aquarists. The South Carolina Aquarium pulls the salt water for their exhibits right out of the Charleston harbor.\n\nIn January 1985, Kelly Tarlton began construction of the first aquarium to include a large transparent acrylic tunnel, Kelly Tarlton's Underwater World in Auckland, New Zealand. Construction took 10 months and cost NZ$3 million. The tunnel was built from one-tonne (2,200-lb) slabs of German sheet plastic that were shaped locally in an oven. A moving walkway now transports visitors through, and groups of school children occasionally hold sleepovers there beneath the swimming sharks and rays.\n\nPublic aquariums are often affiliated with oceanographic research institutions or conduct their own research programs, and sometimes specialize in species and ecosystems that can be found in local waters. For example, the Vancouver Aquarium in Vancouver, BC is a major center for marine research, conservation, and marine animal rehabilitation, particularly for the rich ecosystem of the Pacific Northwest. The Vancouver Aquarium was the first aquarium to capture and display an orca whale, Moby Doll, for three months in 1964; as well as belugas, narwhals and dolphins. The Monterey Bay Aquarium was the first public aquarium to display a great white shark. Beginning in September 2004, the Outer Bay exhibit (now the Open Sea galleries) was the home to the first in a series of great white sharks. The shark was at the aquarium for 198 days (the previous record was 16 days). The shark was released on March 31, 2005. The Adventure Aquarium in New Jersey has hippos. The Aquarium du Quebec houses polar bears.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "966895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=966895", "title": "Shadow of Memories", "text": "Shadow of Memories\n\nThe objective of \"Shadow of Memories\" is to guide player character Eike Kusch through the fictional German town of Lebensbaum (Life's Tree) as he travels through time to prevent and unmask his murderer. The game takes place in three parts: a prologue, eight chapters, and an epilogue. In the prologue and each chapter, Eike dies, is resurrected by the non-player character Homunculus, and travels back in time before his death with the intent of changing events to prevent it. \"Shadow of Memories\" lacks traditional action elements, and Eike cannot attack nor does he have a bar displaying his health. The digipad, a time-traveling item given to Eike by Homunculus, requires energy units, which the player can find scattered around the town. The gameplay primarily consists of time-traveling through the different eras, finding items, and interacting through dialogue with the non-player characters. Actions taken in one time period affect future ones; for example, if Eike removes a seal from the squire's manor in 1580, the seal will not appear in the present era.\n\nAdditionally, the game keeps two digital clocks: one depicting the time in the present-day era and another for whichever era Eike time-travels to. The amount of time Eike spends in the different eras also passes in the present-day one. The cut-scenes and dialogue takes up varying amounts of in-game time. When the clock arrives at the time of Eike's death, the chapter restarts, however, if Eike is not in his time period at the time of his death, the game ends.\n\nSet in a fictional German town named Lebensbaum (Life's Tree), \"Shadow of Memories\" revolves around a 22-year-old man named Eike Kusch, who dies in the beginning of the game from being stabbed after leaving a small diner. However, he is resurrected by Homunculus (voiced by Charles Martinet in English), a djinn or genie, who offers to send him back in time to prevent his death and gives him the time-traveling digipad. Eike explores four eras—2001, 1979/1980, 1902 and 1580 to 1584 — as he attempts to unmask his killer and figure out a way of stopping his own murder at various points in the present. Along the way he encounters several characters: Dana, a modern-day waitress whom he accidentally brings back to the year 1580 and loses; the present-day fortune teller, who tells Eike the hour of his death; Eckart Brum, the curator of a private art museum who lost his wife and infant daughter in a shooting; Dr. Wolfgang Wagner, an alchemist living in 1580 with his wife, Helena, and their two children, Hugo and Margarete; and Alfred Brum, the great-grandfather of Eckart.\n\nGiven a red stone by Dana, Eike follows the Homunculus' instructions to give the stone to Wagner. Time-traveling ten days later, Eike discovers that the result of Wagner's experiment destroyed the lab and caused Hugo, already upset by his mother's death due to a lingering illness, to build a time machine and track Eike down with the intent of killing him. Depending on the player's actions, Hugo holds either Margarete or Dana hostage in the present and plans to use the red stone, revealed to be the Philosopher's Stone, to resurrect his mother.\n\n\"Shadow of Memories\" consists of eight endings, with six available at first. The last two must be unlocked by achieving the first six. The endings are presented in an alphabetical format, A–E, with B having two variations, and then two \"EX\" endings. In all endings, he discovers that Homunculus was using him to ensure that he would be \"created\" (actually unsealed) by Wagner, and returns the digipad to him.\n\nEnding A: Eike discovers that Homunculus switched the infants Dana and Margarete after meeting him in the towns park in 1980, making modern-day Dana actually Margarete Wagner and medieval-Margarete actually Dana. Furthermore, after visiting the fortuneteller in the modern day, it is revealed that she is the trapped disembodied spirit of Hugo's mother, Helena Wagner, brought back after a failed attempt by Hugo to resurrect her using unmastered alchemy. Homunculus creates a puppet resembling Wolfgang Wagner to attempt to dissuade Hugo from his plans, and after a short discussion, the puppet and Hugo disappear in a haze of smoke. Homunculus slyly reveals they could not call up the spirit of the real Dr. Wagner-as Eike had requested-because he was in fact not dead yet but Homunculus does not disclose Dr. Wagner's whereabouts. While returning the digipad to Homunculus, Eike accidentally drops the device, which explodes, killing Homunculus with a single piece of shrapnel striking his cheek(Homunculus had stated on multiple occasions that their body was extremely fragile). Sometime later, it is mentioned that Margarete is now reunited with her biological parents, the Brums, who adopted her, though it appears that none of them are aware of their true relation to each other. Depending on the outcome of a certain time-travelling sub-quest, Eckart's wife and Margarete's mother, Miriam Brum, may or may not be alive as well (she was implied to have been killed by a seemingly stray bullet while taking a walk with her baby, in the original time-line). While on a date together in the townsquare, Eike and Margarete (who are implied to now be in a relationship) return to the spot where Homunculus died, only to discover a large full-grown tree which contains the Philosopher's Stone already embedded in its trunk.\n\nEnding B: There are two variations to ending B: B1 and B2. In B1, Eike discovers the fortune teller's identity and convinces Hugo to enter the hut to meet with her; Helena causes the building to collapse, killing Hugo, who allows himself to be killed by debris in order to be reunited with his mother (though it is not mentioned if her spirit is actually freed by this). He then returns Margarete to the past in which she grew up (though the present is actually her birth-era). B2 sees Hugo attempt to abandon Margarete in the present, only to have Eckart subdue and scold him (neither he nor Margarete are aware of their true relation to each other). Hugo apologizes and returns to the past with Margarete. Both variations conclude with Eike's decision to have a drink at the bar in celebration of living.\n\nEnding C: Eike travels to 1580. Hugo searches for his father's research while an elderly Hugo appears with a time machine and offers to teach him to use it. When Eike reveals his presence in an effort to stop young Hugo from listening, the older version panics and tries to escape up the stairs. Margarete gets in his way, and he threatens and tries to strike her with his cane. Hugo rushes to stop him, and the two make contact, causing both Hugos cease to exist due to a dimensional paradox. Margarete collapses, and Eike returns to the present, where he gives the Digipad back. After Homunculus' departure, Eike lies down in the street to look at the stars praising being alive, only to be run over by two drunk men in a car.\n\nEnding D: Eike enters the ruined lab and burns Wagner's notes about the Stone, just as Hugo and Margarete enter. Unable to read the burned notes, Hugo apparently never learns about what his father was working on and thus never desires revenge or create a time machine, causing the Hugo and Margarete in the present to disappear. Hugo then decides to live his own life. It is revealed in a flashback that Homunculus is actually a djinn or genie imprisoned in the form of what became known as the Philosopher's Stone, and not at all an artificial life created by Wolfgang Wagner. Upon learning of this from a newly awakened Homunculus (who appears once the Stone evaporates into smoke), Wolfgang suddenly realizes that he has ultimately wasted the majority of his adult life for literally nothing as he has neglected his family by spending virtually all of his time over the years seeking to cure his wife's progressively degenerative illness by attempting to create a Philosopher's Stone in his lab, only for her to die anyway before he ever managed to accomplish anything; with Homunculus' revelation that the Philosopher's Stone is merely just the Homunculus' sealed form and not really an alchemical creation at all, it turns out that it was always impossible to begin with, already right from the very start. Instantly becoming extremely depressed, Wolfgang immediately experiences a nervous breakdown and fervently wishes to be young again like Eike (who he had met earlier and who impressed him with his youthful energy), so as to have a \"do-over\". Homunculus callously derides him for his spontaneous emotional outburst and an enraged Wolfgang then tries to reseal them with a pentagram. This enrages Homunculus in turn and just before they transform into the Stone again, they curse Wolfgang \"to suffer the eternal night of youth\" (the blessing of eternal youth but saddled with perpetually recurring amnesia) thus filling the room with smoke and lightning. Once the air clears, Wolfgang Wagner's younger self is revealed to in fact actually be Eike himself (it is subtly hinted earlier in the game in a conversation between Eike and Helena on her deathbed shortly before her death, that Helena finds that Eike's voice sounds shockingly similar to Wolfgang's). Over the course of the next several centuries, Eike then becomes an immortal wanderer who permanently loses all his long-term memories on a regular periodic basis.\n\nEnding E: Eike asks Dana, the actual Margarete Wagner (his biological daughter, based on Ending D, though neither is aware of this), to return with him to the present in which she grew up, and she agrees. She is held hostage by Hugo (again, neither of them nor Eike are aware of their true relation to each other). Eike goes to get Margarete and brings her to the present, where she slaps and scolds Hugo. Tearfully, she tells him she can try and be more like their mother was to them and take care of them both. Hugo apologizes, then returns to the past with Margarete, who had managed to warn Eike about Hugo's plans. Eike and Dana are then about to intimately share a tender embrace but are suddenly interrupted by Homunculus. After a brief conversation in which Eike returns the digipad to Homunculus, Eike walks Dana back to her apartment. It is shown that while Dana says to Eike that she feels that he seems like he would be a \"cool dad\" as he appears to her to be \"with it all\", it remains deliberately ambiguous as to whether they still retain any serious romantic attraction for each other after literally years of separation between them on the part of Dana when she was in the Middle Ages; this has caused many fans to speculate that, given their continued flirtatious rapport with each other due to genetic sexual attraction, could possibly lead to future accidental incest on their part as they are actually secretly long-lost father and daughter (further fueled by the ending screen featuring Dana's picture and containing an admission from Eike that he does not know what his future may hold, which may be for the best). In a flashback, it is shown that Homunculus made Wagner disappear (possibly killing him), after he had wished never to see the creature again. It is possible this is not actually a flashback, but an epilogue, revealing what happens after Eike gives Dr. Wagner the Stone, which contains the Homunculus he sealed away in another timeline. This also explains how Eike is able to encounter Homunculus in the ruins of Wagner's house after the experiment fails and why they did not recognize him.\n\nEX Ending: This has two variations. Awakening from his first death with all his memories, Eike gets the red stone from the diner before Dana comes looking for him. \nBoth result in Eike fading away. Regardless of either choice, the final scene is the same. A young man who resembles Eike is walking through the streets in present-day and struck down like before. The object turns out to be a soccer ball that hit him, and the man returns the ball to a boy similar in appearance to Hugo.\n\nDeveloped by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, a playable demo of \"Shadow of Memories\" debuted at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2000. The game went through several development titles: \"The Day and Night of Walpurgisnacht\", \"Days of Walpurgis\", and \"Time Adventure\". Konami released \"Shadow of Memories\" for the PlayStation 2 in Japan on February 22, 2001, in North America on March 5, 2001 (retitled as \"Shadow of Destiny\"), and in Europe on March 30, 2001. In 2002, the now-defunct Runecraft company ported it to the PC, while an Xbox port appeared simultaneously in Europe and Australasia; a PlayStation Portable port arrived in 2009.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version received \"favorable\" reviews, while the PC and PSP versions received \"mixed or average reviews\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the PS2 version a score of 30 out of 40.\n\nReviewers praised the overall plot of the PS2 version as the game's strength. IGN's David Zdyrko called the story \"one of the deepest and most engaging that has ever been told through a videogame.\" Andrew Vestal of GameSpot enjoyed the idea of the detective in a murder mystery as the intended victim. Writing for Game Revolution, Shawn Sanders liked the time-traveling aspect of the game.\n\nThe graphics of the PS2 version received mixed responses. Sanders found the textures of the game \"clean and detailed\". Zdyrko disliked the low amount of detail on the characters and some of the background, but enjoyed the \"lighting and particle effects\", particularly the snow and night. Vestal praised the different visual depictions of Lebensbaum, and felt that high level of detail in the backgrounds helped to somewhat counterbalance the low-resolution of the game's graphics. Critics agreed that the full motion videos were well-done, and praised the realistic character animation. \nCritics commented on the general absence of action in the gameplay. Sanders considered it the game's greatest flaw and a possible source of frustration for players. The slow beginning to the PS2 version was remarked on by critics, who felt that the game eventually picked up after a while. Additionally, the \"stiff\" motion of the protagonist when running drew criticism. Reviewers noted the relatively short play time, and felt that the multiple endings enhanced the game's replay value.\n\nThe game's soundtrack was well received. Critics wrote that it suited the mood and occasionally helped to build suspense. The voice acting also went over well, with several critics remarking on the quality of it. Zdyrko described it as \"first-class\" and believable, and commented that since much of the PS2 version consists of dialogue, flawed voice acting might have ruined the game. Vestal considered the voice acting of B-movie quality, but not flawed enough to be a major distraction.\n\n\"Shadow of Memories\" was a nominee for \"The Electric Playground\"s 2002 \"Best Adventure Game for PC\" and GameSpot's \"Best Adventure Game on PC\" awards, but lost variously to \"Syberia\" and \"Silent Hill 2\". The latter publication's editors called it \"one of the best PC adventure games to come around in some time\". In 2011, Adventure Gamers named \"Shadow of Memories\" the 68th-best adventure game ever released.\n\nAfter \"Shadow of Memories\", Kawano wrote and directed another game with a time-traveling element: the 2008 Nintendo DS title \"Time Hollow\"; it focuses on seventeen-year-old Ethan Kairos, who awakens in a world where his parents have been missing for twelve years, and his quest to find them. Along the way, he obtains the Hollow Pen, which allows him to create time portals to solve the mystery. \"Time Hollow\" continues the \"themes of time manipulation and paradoxes\", for which Kawano has expressed an interest.\n\n"}

One manner of assessing such attitudes in the modern era has been to conduct opinion polls to measure levels of public opinion on abortion.\n\n\n\nA May 2005 Euro RSCG/TNS Sofres poll examined attitudes toward abortion in 10 European countries, asking polltakers whether they agreed with the statement, \"If a woman doesn't want children, she should be able to have an abortion\".\nResults were as follows:\n\nAn April 2003 CDC/ORC Macro report examined sentiment on abortion among women aged 15 to 44 in six former-Comecon countries, asking, \"Do you think that (in any situation) a woman always has (or should have) the right to decide about her (own) pregnancy, including whether to have an abortion?\"\nThe results were:\n\nAmong those whose response was \"no\" above, it was then asked if abortion would be acceptable under selected circumstances. Positive responses to this subsequent question were:\n\n\n\n\nAn October 2006 Pew Research Center survey of moral opinion among Christians in 10 countries asked \"... [Do] you think abortion can always be justified, sometimes be justified, or never be justified?\" \n\nThe poll also asked respondents whether they agreed with the statement, \"The government should not interfere with a woman’s ability to have an abortion\".\n\nA survey in the United States of more than 10,000 physicians (not only obstetricians) came to the result that 34% of physicians would perform an abortion in certain situations, even if it were against their own beliefs. Approximately 54% would not, and for the remaining 12%, it would depend on circumstances.\n\n\n"}

Historically Tasmania provides a fascinating literary background with visits from early European explorers such as the Dutchman Abel Tasman, the Frenchmen Bruni d'Entrecasteaux and Marion du Fresne and then the English explorers Matthew Flinders and George Bass. The colonisation of Tasmania was characterised by deteriorated relations with the indigenous Aboriginal people and a harsh convict heritage. These early elements of Tasmanian history are found both in the large number of colonial sandstone buildings and in the place names. Environmentally, Tasmania's picturesque landscapes and changeable weather, provide a vivid backdrop to Tasmanian literary culture. Tasmania's geographical isolation, rich creative community, proximity to Antarctica, controversial colonial past, bourgeoning reputation as a dynamic centre for the arts, and status as an island state, are some of the influences found in the island's significant collection of literature.\n\nMany authors of both fiction and non-fiction call Tasmania home, and there are many acclaimed and highly awarded titles set in Tasmania or written by Tasmanians. The long established national journal of letters, \"Island\" magazine is published quarterly in Tasmania. The Tasmanian government provides some arts funding in the form of prizes, events and grants, while local bookshops contribute to the writing community by hosting book launches and other literary events.\n\nTasmania's unique history and environment gave rise to Tasmanian Gothic literature during the 19th century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "113427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113427", "title": "Terms of Endearment", "text": "Terms of Endearment\n\nTerms of Endearment is a 1983 American comedy-drama film adapted from Larry McMurtry's 1975 novel, directed, written, and produced by James L. Brooks, and starring Shirley MacLaine, Debra Winger, Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVito, Jeff Daniels, and John Lithgow. The film covers 30 years of the relationship between Aurora Greenway (MacLaine) and her daughter Emma (Winger).\n\nThe film received eleven Academy Award nominations, and won five. Brooks won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, while MacLaine won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and Nicholson won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In addition, it won four Golden Globes: Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Actress in a Drama (MacLaine), Best Supporting Actor (Nicholson), and Best Screenplay (Brooks).\n\nWidowed Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine) keeps several suitors at arm's length, focusing instead on her close, but controlling, relationship with daughter Emma (Debra Winger). Anxious to escape her mother, Emma marries young college professor Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels) over her mother's objections, moves away, and has three children. Despite their frequent spats and difficulty getting along, Emma and Aurora have a tie between them that cannot be broken, and keep in touch by telephone.\n\nEmma and Flap soon run into financial and marital difficulties. Emma has trouble managing the children and household, and she and Flap both have extramarital affairs. Emma relies increasingly on her mother for emotional support. Meanwhile, the lonely Aurora overcomes her repression, and begins a whirlwind romance with her next-door neighbor, retired astronaut Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson). \n\nThe Horton family moves from Houston to Des Moines and eventually to Nebraska, apparently for Flap's career, but mostly so he can be near his girlfriend. Emma is diagnosed with cancer, which becomes terminal. Aurora stays by Emma's side through her treatment and hospitalization, even while dealing with her own pain after Garrett suddenly ends their relationship. The dying Emma shows her love for her mother by entrusting her own children to Aurora's care. After Emma's death, Garrett re-appears in the family's life, and begins to bond with Emma's young children.\n\n\nBrooks wrote the supporting role of Garrett Breedlove for Burt Reynolds, who turned down the role because of a verbal commitment he had made to appear in \"Stroker Ace\". \"There are no awards in Hollywood for being an idiot\", Reynolds later said of the decision.\n\nThe exterior shots of Aurora's home were filmed at 3060 Locke Lane, Houston, Texas. Larry McMurtry, writer of the novel on which the screenplay was based, had received his M.A. at Rice University, a mere three miles from the home.\n\nThe exterior shots of locations intended to be in Des Moines, Iowa, Kearney, Nebraska, and Lincoln, Nebraska, were all filmed in Lincoln, Nebraska. Many scenes were filmed on, or near, the campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. During filming in Lincoln, Debra Winger met the then-governor of Nebraska, Bob Kerrey, and wound up dating him for two years.\n\nMacLaine and Winger did not get along with each other during production. MacLaine confirmed in an interview that \"it was a very tough shoot...Chaotic...(Jim) likes working with tension on the set.\"\n\nOn working with Nicholson, MacLaine said, \"Working with Jack Nicholson was crazy\", but that his spontaneity may have contributed to her performance. She also said,\n\nWe're like old smoothies working together. You know the old smoothies they used to show whenever you went to the Ice Follies. They would have this elderly man and woman – who at that time were 40 – and they had a little bit too much weight around the waist and were moving a little slower. But they danced so elegantly and so in synch with each other that the audience just laid back and sort of sighed. That's the way it is working with Jack. We both know what the other is going to do. And we don't socialize, or anything. It's an amazing chemistry – a wonderful, wonderful feeling.\n\nMacLaine confirmed in an interview with \"USA Today\" that Nicholson improvised when he put his hand down her dress in the beach scene.\n\n\"Terms of Endearment\" was commercially successful. On its opening weekend, it grossed $3.4 million, ranking number two, until its second weekend, when it grossed $3.1 million, ranking #1 at the box office. Three weekends later, it arrived number one again, with $9,000,000, having wide release. For four weekends, it remained number one at the box office, until slipping to number two on its tenth weekend. On the film's 11th weekend, it arrived number one (for the sixth and final time), grossing $3,000,000. For the last weekends of the film, it later dwindled downward. The film grossed $108,423,489 in the United States.\n\nThe film was generally well regarded by critics, and maintains an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus: \"A classic tearjerker, \"Terms of Endearment\" isn't shy about reaching for the heartstrings – but is so well-acted and smartly scripted that it's almost impossible to resist.\" Roger Ebert gave the film a four-out-of-four star rating, calling it \"a wonderful film\" and stating, \"There isn't a thing that I would change, and I was exhilarated by the freedom it gives itself to move from the high comedy of Nicholson's best moments to the acting of Debra Winger in the closing scenes.\" Gene Siskel, who gave the film a highly enthusiastic review, correctly predicted upon its release that it would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1983. In his movie guide, Leonard Maltin awarded the film a rare four-star rating, calling it a \"Wonderful mix of humor and heartache\", and concluded the film was \"Consistently offbeat and unpredictable, with exceptional performances by all three stars\".\n\nThe film won five Academy Awards and four Golden Globe Awards:\n\n\n\nA sequel to the film, \"The Evening Star\" (1996), in which MacLaine and Nicholson reprised their roles, was a critical and commercial failure.\n\n"}

This also marked a first. It was the first Maori language record to hit the no 1 spot in New Zealand. \"The Bridge\" is an example of an artist in the 1980s contributing to the success of a record. This was done by kick starting the process in the beginning by self-financing the record, having a hand in its own promotion by employing various tactics to get the record heard by the public.\n\nIt was sung in Māori language, and set to Nini Rosso's tune \"Il Silenzio\". The words were written Waretini's cousin, George Tait, a Te Arawa elder. It pushed John Lennon off the charts when it climbed to the top.\n\nThe Bridge was originally independently and self-released. It wasn't picked up CBS until later. After that it became the first no 1 song to be sung in the Maori language. It stayed at the top of the charts for two weeks.\n\nThe song has a meaning to it. It centers around the construction of the Mangere Bridge. The songs lyrics refer to the linking of two cultures in New Zealand, Māori and Pakeha.\n\nIt was recorded in Auckland in the suburb of Henderson. The session took place in a garage studio that belonged to a country singer. The ensemble that backed him on the recording included musicians from the Blind Institute. According to Alan Perrotts article, \"You must remember this\" in the March 30, 2009 edition of \"The New Zealand Herald\", the group that backed Waretini, referred to there as The Rising Suns, was formerly called The Radars. The trumpet player on the song who happened to be married to the niece of George Tait was Kevin Furey formerly of the Quincy Conserve. Waretini didn't have money to pay the musicians so he paid them in Kentucky Fried Chicken.\n\nHis use of a tactic first employed by Gary Havoc & The Hurricanes of self-financing a record, Waretini paid for his own record. He had a pile of the singles produced, which cost him $96. Some singles were sent to Radio 1ZB. Waretini then bombarded them with play requests. He also managed to get it played at intermission time at Auckland's Civic Theatre. Another tactic was recruiting a news paper boy to sell copies to passing people for 50 cents a piece. (His backing band, The Rising Stars, two years later in 1983 would use the same approach to getting the single out there.) The single which was produced by Allan Witana, and originally released on the Innovations label. A short time later, people going into record shops looking for \"The Bridge\". Not long afterwards, CBS wanted to put it out. On the third of April 1981, the song went to no 1, pushing John Lennon's \"Woman\" from the top spot it previously held. It also reached no 7 in Australia.\n\nFor his part, Warentini he received $27,000 from CBS and also gave up his rights to the song.\n\nThere is an Unreleased Alternative Version by Waretini that appears on the \"\", various artists compilation that was released by His Master's Voice and EMI in 2011.\n\nIn 1981, the song became victim to a parody by Kevin Blackatini and the Frigids, and a record was released on the RTC label. Kevin Blackatini was actually Radio Hauraki DJ, Kevin Black.\n"}

The show and its sequel seasons are collectively referred to as the \"Total Drama\" series. It premiered on the Canadian cable television specialty channel Teletoon on July 8, 2007, and on the American cable television channel Cartoon Network on June 5, 2008. All of the contestants have distinct personalities that serve as main plot points with the characters consisting of the eponymous fictional reality series and the contestants therein. The style of this series is similar to that of \"Survivor\". \"Total Drama\" was met with critical acclaim upon release and has developed a cult following.\n\nThe \"Total Drama\" series is the original series of the greater \"Total Drama\" franchise, which consists of five seasons that have aired during a timeframe of seven years: the first season, \"Total Drama Island\", the second season, \"Total Drama Action\", the third season, \"Total Drama World Tour\", the fourth season, \"\", and the fifth season, titled as both \"Total Drama All-Stars\" and \"Total Drama: Pahkitew Island\". The latest installment premiered on July 7, 2014, in the United States and September 4, 2014, in Canada. A spin-off series based on the main series, \"\", was produced shortly after the fifth season was aired. A spin-off series in an alternative universe, titled \"Total DramaRama\" was released on September 1, 2018 on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and on October 7, 2018 on Teletoon in Canada.\n\nA month after the American debut of \"Total DramaRama\", McGillis confirmed there would be no more new seasons of \"Total Drama\", citing the lack of a \"market for this experience in the wider entertainment marketplace\" as the main reason for the cancellation of the series.\n\nThe name of each season consists of the title \"Total Drama\" with a different word or phrase later added. That changing word or phrase defines the theme for that season. This series is a competition to win a cash prize of C$100,000 in the first season and C$1,000,000 in every other season. This series takes elements of other widely known series such as \"Survivor\", \"Fear Factor\", \"The Amazing Race\", and \"Escape from Scorpion Island\". Like these other series, \"Total Drama\" is rated TV-PG because it features mild profanity, censored language, brief censored nudity, and some suggestive dialogue. When more suggestive dialogue is present, the episode is rated TV-PG-D. The first three seasons are rated TV-PG-D while the latter two are rated TV-PG. Unlike many other animated shows, this series has a different logo for every season (while each season might have multiple alternate logos), so there is no official logo for this series.\n\nMost seasons in this series takes place in a different location. The first season, \"Total Drama Island\", is set in Camp Wawanakwa, a fictional island located in an unspecified area in Muskoka, Ontario. The second season, \"Total Drama Action\", is set in an abandoned movie studio lot in Toronto, Ontario. In the third season, \"Total Drama World Tour\", the contestants are taken all around the world in the \"Total Drama Jumbo Jet\", which seems to be structurally unstable. Some of the countries that are visited in the third season include Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The fourth season, \"Total Drama: Revenge of the Island\", is set back at Camp Wawanakwa, but this time the island is radioactive. The first part of the fifth season, \"Total Drama All-Stars\", also takes place on the island, due to the success of the first and fourth seasons. The second part, \"Total Drama: Pahkitew Island\" however, takes place on another island called Pahkitew Island after the destruction of Camp Wawanakwa.\n\n\"Total Drama\" was developed and produced by Fresh TV and was distributed by Cake Entertainment. The series is funded in part by the Canada Media Fund (formerly the Canadian Television Fund), and the Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit. The first season was funded by Xenpohile Media, Bell Broadcast and New Media Fund. The series, primarily targeted at eight to sixteen-year-olds, was animated at Elliott Animation and directed by Todd Kauffman and Mark Thornton of Neptoon Studios. The creators, Tom McGillis and Jennifer Pertsch, studied what teenagers liked and disliked about reality television shows in the writing process.\n\nMcGillis says they used a \"countrywide online research project\" to determine this demographic's likes. Fresh TV Inc. partners McGillis, Pertsch, Elliott and Irving produced the series. The budget for the first season was $8 million. It was animated in Flash, at Elliott Animation's studio in Toronto.\n\nEvery cast and crew member on \"Total Drama\" had to sign a confidentiality agreement not to disclose who the winner was. All the characters were designed by Kauffman. An early name for the series was \"Camp TV\" when the series first started production in 2006. Camp TV Productions is still labeled in the end credits of every episode, along with the season number in Roman numerals.\n\nSeries production stopped in 2014 as no new seasons were produced since. Instead, starting in 2015 the studio has focused the franchise more on producing separate spin-off series, with their respective voice actors being reused in the new spin-offs.\n\nOn May 3, 2017, it was announced that \"Total Drama\" would be making a return. It was later revealed that it would be returning as a new series titled \"Total DramaRama\". The show is a spin-off that has the contestants as kids in daycare.\n\nThis is a list of all the seasons that have aired with the original Canada air dates shown below along with basic elements for each season. The 100th episode of the whole series aired in Canada on February 27, 2014, with the producers very happy of this milestone. That means that it took Teletoon 6 years and 7 months for them to air the first 100 episodes.\n\nThere are currently five seasons in the \"Total Drama\" series that have aired worldwide which all are listed below. The air dates listed in the table are from the original Canadian airings.\n\nSource for season list:\n\nOriginally, co-creator Tom McGillis had stated that his personal goal was for \"Total Drama\" to go up to ten seasons. Alex Ganetakos, the executive story editor and the senior writer for the series, also mentioned that the production team planned to make more seasons in the future. However, in a Reddit Q&A on September 25, 2018, when asked if there would be additional seasons, Tom McGillis responded with \"Nope. Sorry to be a dreamkiller, but there's no market for this experience in the wider entertainment marketplace right now\".\n\n\"Total Drama\" first premiered in Canada on July 8, 2007 on Teletoon, while the United States aired the show one year later on Cartoon Network on June 5, 2008, followed by several other countries thereafter.

Both Christian Potenza and Clé Bennett voice the two main characters in the series, who appear in almost every episode. Christian Potenza plays the role of egotistical and unapathetic host Chris McLean, saying that the best part of the job was that his character could not be voted off the show. Clé Bennett plays the role of the co-host of the series Chef. Other voice actors include Brian Froud, who voices contestants Harold and Sam and is the only other voice actor who has the main role in every season. Emilie-Claire Barlow plays the contestant Courtney on \"Total Drama\" and stated that Courtney was her favorite character that she had ever played.\n\nA list of all the voice actors for the original cast: Rochelle Wilson/Emilie-Claire Barlow as Courtney, Clé Bennett as DJ, Julia Chantrey as Eva, Carla Collins as Blaineley, Katie Crown as Izzy, Novie Edwards as Leshawna, Megan Fahlenbock as Gwen, Kristin Fairlie as Bridgette, Brian Froud as Harold, Sarah Gadon as Beth, Marco Grazzini as Alejandro (for \"Total Drama World Tour\"), Carter Hayden as Noah, Alex House as Alejandro (for \"Total Drama All-Stars\"), Lauren Lipson as Sadie, Scott McCord as both Owen and Trent, Stephanie Anne Mills as both Katie and Lindsay, Drew Nelson as Duncan, Annick Obonsawin as Sierra, Peter Oldring as Ezekiel, Tyler and Cody, Dan Petronijevic as Geoff, Adam Reid as Justin, and Rachel Wilson as Heather.\n\nFor the second-generation cast, the voice actors are: Carleigh Beverly as Dakota, Jon Cor as Brick, Cory Doran as Mike, Kevin Duhaney as Cameron, Laurie Elliot as Jo, Brian Froud as Sam, Athena Karkanis as Anne Maria, Barbara Mamabolo as Zoey, Caitlynne Medrek as Dawn, Ashley Peters as Staci, Tyrone Savage as Lightning, and James Wallis as Scott.\n\nFor the third-generation cast, the voice actors are: Clé Bennett as Beardo and Leonard, Zachary Bennett as Shawn, Katie Bergin as Jasmine, Daniel DeSanto as Dave, Bruce Dow as Max, Kristi Friday as Scarlett, Christopher Jacot as Topher, Bryn McAuley as Amy and Samey, Sunday Muse as Ella, Sarah Podemski as Sky, Ian Ronningen as Rodney, and Rochelle Wilson as Sugar.\n\nMost voice actors have only voiced one character, while some actors have voiced two characters. Peter Oldring and Clé Bennett are the only two voice actors who have voiced more than two characters, Oldring voicing three and Bennett voicing four (five if counting DJ's mother). However, if the spin-offs are to be included, then multiple voice actors have voiced multiple characters throughout the franchise. Brian Froud, Rochelle Wilson, and Bennett are the only voice actors to voice contestants from more than one generation. Claire-Barlow revealed that Courtney was originally voiced by an unnamed voice actress, later revealed to be Rochelle Wilson as the first voice of Courtney in the first two episodes of \"Total Drama Island\" before the role was later given to her.

Cake Entertainment, the main distributor of the series, calls the show \"phenomenally popular\", while the creator of the series said that \"For tweens around the world, \"Total Drama\" is more than just a parody of a reality show. It's THEIR reality show\".\n\nThe first season, \"Total Drama Island\" received general acclaim from critics and fans. Users from \"TV.com\" gave the show an 8.6 \"Great\", while users from \"IMDB\" gave it a 7.5 out of 10. \"Common Sense Media\" gave the show 4 out of 5 stars, calling it a \"[c]lever cartoon reality show spoof\".\n\nThe second season, \"Total Drama Action\", received less acclaim due to being seen as less on par with \"Total Drama Island\"; a primary criticism was the selection of contestants from \"Island\" who had already made it far in that season, thus neglecting most of the contestants who were eliminated earlier. \"Action\" currently holds a 7.9 on Metacritic based on 14 reviews.\n\nThe third season, \"Total Drama World Tour\", has also received critical acclaim from critics and won multiple awards including \"Best Animated Series\", \"Best Voice Actress\" (for Annick Obonsawin), and was also nominated for several other awards; however, the criticisms included the overuse of the love triangle between Courtney, Duncan, and Gwen, as well as the destruction of the character Ezekiel.\n\n\"Total Drama: Revenge of the Island\" received mixed to positive reviews, airing in over 100 countries and holding a 6.7 on Metacritic based on 15 reviews, thus indicating \"Generally favorable reviews.\"\n\n\"Total Drama All-Stars\" has received mixed to negative reviews, with the primary criticisms being the neglecting of original favorites in favor of the \"Revenge of the Island\" cast, and many wasted plotlines such as building up a reconciliation between Courtney and Gwen, only to have it be ruined again. \"All-Stars\" currently holds a 5.4 rating on Metacritic based on 9 reviews. \"Total Drama Pahkitew Island\", however, received significantly more positive reviews.\n\n\nUp until November 1, 2011, only \"Total Drama Island\" had been released on DVD. Cartoon Network released their \"Total Drama Island\" DVD in the U.S. on August 18, 2009 (Region 1), while Madman Entertainment (Region 4) also released \"Total Drama Island\" on DVD in Australia, but this time in two parts (Collection 1 on May 5, 2010, and Collection 2 on September 29, 2010). However, almost two years after \"Total Drama Action\" was first aired, Madman released their Collection 1 DVD of the second season on November 2, 2011 (with Collection 2 being released on July 4, 2012), making Australia the only country that has released the entirety of \"Total Drama Action\" for private home viewing. Australia also released \"Total Drama World Tour\" on DVD with Collection 1 being released on April 3, 2013, and Collection 2 being released on August 7, 2013. On October 8, 2014, \"Total Drama: Revenge of the Island\" was released into one part due to it being a shorter season. The first part of the fifth season, \"Total Drama All-Stars\" was released on March 4, 2015, with the second part, \"Total Drama: Pahkitew Island\" being released on July 7, 2015.\n\n\"Total Drama\" episodes were made available on streaming services, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and iTunes. Currently, Netflix is missing \"Total Drama World Tour\" and \"Total Drama: Revenge of the Island\" while retaining all other seasons, especially \"\". \"Total Drama\" was made available for purchasing on iTunes until December 5, 2015, but still available on Amazon Prime, with the exception of \"The Ridonculous Race\".\n\nTeletoon hosted a \"Total Drama\"-based website called \"Total Drama Online\" from 2009 to 2013 where players could play games and earn badges to win prizes. Even though most features (like user accounts, original avatar designer and badge counter) from this website are exclusive to only Canadian viewers, all of the games and basic elements were available to the rest of the world. Cartoon Network also had their own \"Total Drama\" website from 2009 to 2015 which was very similar to the Canadian one, but was only exclusive to viewers in the United States. Various alternate websites based on the series also exist throughout most of the other countries the show airs in, which are all in their respective languages.\n\nA new spin-off series called \"Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race\" was created by Fresh TV which takes place in the same universe as the current show. The new series is loosely based off after the format of \"The Amazing Race\" where the cast is split into multiple teams of two (referred to as duos) which race around the world throughout the series. There is a new host this series called Don, who replaced the original host Chris. Even though some of the characters from the main series make appearances, the spin-off series is primarily dominated by a new cast. The spin-off series is a \"buddy comedy\" and includes 18 pairs of teams (36 characters). It first premiered on September 7, 2015, on Cartoon Network and later premiered on January 4, 2016, on the Canadian version of Cartoon Network.\n\nAnother spin-off series was announced on December 19, 2017, as \"Total Drama Daycare\". The series was later renamed \"Total DramaRama\". It was released in September 2018 on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and October 2018 on Teletoon in Canada. The new series will have 52 episodes and for the first time in the franchise, the episodes will have a new runtime with a shorter length of eleven minutes. It is set to feature some of the original characters from \"Total Drama Island\" as toddlers such as Beth, Bridgette, Cody, Courtney, Duncan, Gwen, Harold, Izzy, Leshawna, Noah and Owen as well as Jude Lizowski from \"6teen\". Chef Hatchet will also return as a younger adult. The series began production in early 2017, and Christian Potenza is confirmed to still have a role for the prequel.\n\nThese are other Canadian animated TV series that are also produced by Fresh TV:\n\nhttps://www.corusent.com/news/corus-entertainment-reveals-its-outstanding-roster-of-new-and-returning-canadian-original-programming-for-2018-2019/\n\n"}
{"id": "51885057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51885057", "title": "Transparency of media ownership in Romania", "text": "Transparency of media ownership in Romania\n\nTransparency of media ownership refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures to make possible for media authorities and the wider public to ascertain who effectively owns and controls the media. In Romania transparency of media ownership is addressed directly in the Constitution and is regulated by a media-specific law, namely the Audiovisual Law no. 504, and by national company law. As for constitutional provisions, even if Romania is among the few European countries that addresses the issue of media transparency directly in the Constitution, it should be said that the focus is on transparency of financial sources and not on ownership. Nonetheless, despite the constitutional provisions on the right to impose an obligation on the media to make public their sources of finance, the Parliament has never enacted the applicable legislation which is indeed absent. The Romanian media-specific law requiring the disclosure of media ownership information applies only to the broadcast sector and provides the disclosure to both a public authority, namely the National Audiovisual Council (CNA) and directly to the public. Finally, also the national company law contains provisions regulating transparency of media ownership. It applies to all media which are registered companies and foresees the obligation to publish all the most relevant information on companies' ownership in the Trade Register Company. Overall, even though the Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is fully aligned with the European standards, in practice sufficient information to assess who effectively owns and ultimately controls the media is not always available.\n\nRomanian law on media ownership transparency only covers the broadcast sector and has no similar provision for print media, but, in practice, many Romanian newspapers make public their publishers and owners. The situation is more complicated for online media and blogs where anonymity is very common.\n\nThe relevant law, named Audiovisual Law no. 504, requires the disclosure of all the information necessary to identify the owners of media companies, e.g. name and contact details of the media organisation; name and contact detail of owners; country of domicile of company with an interest; citizenship / residence status of individual with an interest beyond a given threshold. However, the disclosure requirement does not apply to beneficial ownership, which refers to shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person. According to the law, the information must be reported to the National Audiovisual Council, a public regulatory authority under the control of the Parliament. The CNA is the guarantor of the public interest in the audiovisual field.\n\nOne of the main problem of the law concerns indirect interest: threshold for disclosing indirect interest, which is 20%, looks too high to provide proper information for assessing media ownership and guaranteeing transparency. Furthermore, getting information on individuals or companies with indirect control or significant interests in a given media company is quite time-consuming and complex as it requires in practice a step-by-step process of checking and cross-referencing of a large number of different records.\n\nWith regard to constraints or costs for public access to the information held by the National Audiovisual Council there are not particularly high costs or time-consuming procedures, even if, in general terms, accessing information held by public institutions often entails several barriers, such as the reluctance of public officials to reveal sensitive information and their resort to broad interpretations of the exceptions to public disclosure of information.\n\nOverall, the legal framework provides the disclosure of nearly all the information needed to identify ownership of the broadcast media in Romania. However, the threshold for reporting indirect interest (20%), the difficulties in obtaining information on entities or persons with indirect control and significant interest, abuses and poor implementation, the lack of co-operation between the CNA and other authorities leave room to abuses and insufficient disclosure.\n\nAccording to Article. 48 of Law 504 of 2002, media companies from the audiovisual field must also disclose the information on media ownership directly to the public through their websites. The requirement applies to all kind of information to be disclosed in accordance with the law. In particular, financial information must be updated and disclosed on an annual basis, while the other information must be always available to the public (requirement of the “permanent access” by the public, according to Article 48).\n\nIn addition to the Audiovisual Law, another source of regulation for transparency of media ownership in Romania is company law which contains non-media specific transparency requirements. The relevant law, which is the Law 31 / 1990 on Trading Companies is applicable to all registered media company owing a licence and forbids owners' anonymity: companies are therefore obliged to publish all the main information on ownership in the Trade Register Office (TRO) and to communicate changes. All the constitutive deeds and the modifications are registered in the Trade Registry and published in the Official Journal. The specific information to be disclosed depends on the legal type of the company and might be different for each type of business organisations. However, the mandatory information for all companies are: names, the date and the place of birth, the address and the citizenship of the partners / shareholders (in case of natural persons); the name, the headquarter address and the nationality of the associates (in case of legal persons); the type, name, headquarters address and the company logo; the company’s field of activity; the registered capital, including the contribution of each partner in cash or in kind; the number and the face value of the shares and the number of shares given to each partners; the managers of the company and their rights; the share given to each associate in case of profit and loss; secondary headquarters.\n\nThe public can directly access this data by requesting information from the Trade Registry. Also, since the constitutive documents are also published in the Official Journal, the public can consult this information through the institutional website of the Journal.\n\nEven if the law requires the disclosure of all necessary information on ownership, in fact this data have to be reported to various agencies. This might imply, for instance, a complicated step-by-step check process involving request for information from different agencies for each company in the cases of chains of ownership, such as companies owning other companies and the like. Moreover, as there are minimal financial sanctions for failure to report in time, in practice few companies comply with the obligation to update ownership information.\n\nAccording to some critics, the Trade Register Office only shows the tip of the iceberg since the real owner of the media and who effectively controls them remain hidden. In addition, although public, the access to information collected in the Register is not free of charge and can even be prohibitive. Despite these limits, the TRO remains the main source of data on media ownership in Romania and even if the learning process might be time-consuming, especially in the most complex cases of unclear ownership, all in all it is feasible given sufficient time and resources to collect all the needed information, including beneficial ownership.\n\nDespite the fact that Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is formally aligned with the European standards (both the European Commission and the Council of Europe standards are incorporated in the national legal framework), in practice, there are some major problems. Among the main shortcomings there is the absence of the requirement to disclose all the necessary data to establish which are the owners in case of indirect control or having significant interests in the media company. Moreover, at the practical level, the implementation of the law leaves room for abuses and inadequate disclosure. In sum, a set of factors, including the difficulty in ascertain indirect control and significant interest, implementation problems as well as the challenges in accessing public information result in a significant difficulty for the general public in accessing all the key information to establish who effectively owns and ultimately controls a media outlet.\n\n"}

Items sold at the ukay-ukay are commonly shipped from different countries.\n\nThe term ukay-ukay is derived from the Filipino verb \"hukay\" or \"halukay\", which means \"to dig\" or \"to sift through\" respectively. It is synonymous with the verb \"wagwag\", an act of dusting off a piece of clothing by taking hold of one end and snapping it in the air, and shake the item chosen to dust it off; and SM, meaning \"segunda mano\" (secondhand), which is also a pun on the foremost Philippine retail chain SM.\n\nThe first ukay-ukay was believed to have been founded in the early 1980s in Baguio. When calamities frequented the Philippines during that year, the Philippine Salvation Army would send secondhand garments and other goods to the refugees and victims as humanitarian assistance to the victims of the calamities. Soon enough, the shipped goods, upon piling up, were bought in bulk by traders and sold to the public at significantly low prices. They used to market it to the low-income bracket, but following ukay-ukay's increase in popularity, relatively richer customers who seek low-priced branded goods patronize ukay-ukay stores.\n\nThe commercial importation of secondhand clothing to the Philippines is prohibited since 1966 under the Republic Act No. 4653 also known as the \"Act to safeguard the health of the Filipino people and maintain the dignity of the nation through the prohibition of the importation of used clothing and rags\". It renders a significant part of the ukay-ukay business illegal. There have been many calls to review and amend the law legalizing the sale of imported used clothing by ukay-ukay stores.\n\n\n\nBibliography\n"}
{"id": "1733839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1733839", "title": "Virtual school", "text": "Virtual school\n\nAn online school (virtual school or e-school or cyber-school) teaches students entirely or primarily online or through the internet. It has been defined as \"education that uses one or more technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor and to support regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor synchronously or asynchronously\". Online education exists all around the world and is used for all levels of education (K-12, college, or graduate school). This type of learning enables the individuals to earn transferable credits, take recognized examinations, or advance to the next level of education over the internet.\n\nVirtual education is most commonly used at the high school or college level. Students who are of the age 30 or older, tend to study on online programs at higher rates. This group represents 41% of the online education population, while 35.5% of students ages 24-29 and 24.5% of students ages 15-23 participate in virtual education.\n\nVirtual education is becoming increasing used worldwide. There are currently more than 4,700 colleges and universities that provide online courses to their students. In 2015, more than 6 million students were taking at least one course online, this number grew by 3.9% from the previous year. 29.7% of all higher education students are taking at least one distance course. The total number of students studying on a campus exclusively dropped by 931,317 people between the years 2012 and 2015. Experts say that because the number of students studying at the college level is growing, there will also be an increase in the number of students enrolled in distance learning. \n\nInstructional models vary, ranging from distance learning types which provide study materials for independent self-paced study, to live, interactive classes where students communicate with a teacher in a class group lesson. Class sizes range widely from a small group of 6 pupils or students to hundreds in a virtual school.\n\nThe courses that are independent and self paced are called asynchronous courses. Typically for this type of learning, the students are given the assignments and information, and are expected to complete the assignments by the due date. This is done on their own time. There is no scheduled time when the class meets. Usually the only interactions that takes place are through discussion boards, blogs, and wikis.\n\nOn the other hand, synchronous online courses happen in real time. The instructor and students all interact online at the same time. This is done either through text, video, or audio chat. Therefore these lessons are socially constructed. In addition to the scheduled class time, there is usually additional assignments to complete. \n\nHybrid, sometimes also called blended, courses are when students learn and interact both in person and online. Theses classes meet in person during the semester in addition to computer based communication. \n\nThe mid-1990s saw the advent of completely virtual schools. Many of today's virtual schools are descendants of correspondence schools. The earlier online schools began in Australia, New Zealand, North America and the UK, generally in areas where low density population made schooling by conventional means difficult and expensive to provide. In 2008 an assessment found high dropout rates. As in other computerized environments, once the glamour of the new methods wore off it became clear that human skills were paramount to success, in this case teaching and welfare expertise. Where this is recognized retention is good, i.e. in the synchronous, socially structured models; in the huge MOOC style courses the same isolation problems as correspondence learning are found.\n\nSometimes referred to as \"distance learning\", correspondence schools offered students an alternative to the traditional brick and mortar meetings within a schoolhouse. These schools utilized the postal service for student-teacher interaction, or used two-way radio transmissions, sometimes with pre-recorded television broadcasts. Students were expected to study their learning material independently and, in some cases, meet with a proctor to be tested.\n\nVirtual schools now exist all around the world. Over the past decade, K-12 online instruction has dramatically increased in both Canada and the United States. Some of these virtual schools have been integrated into public schools (particularly in the United States), where students sit in computer labs and do their work online. Students can also be completely home-schooled, or they can take any combination of public/private/home-schooling and online classes.\n\nThe International Association for K-12 Online Learning (iNACOL) developed a set of standards released in September 2007 and updated on October 12, 2011. These standards will help monitor online programs and ensure that every provider of education is accredited. \n\nWhere online methods are integrated with State provision, costs follow state school standards. Otherwise fees must be met by the student, or parents. Many US school districts are now creating their own online services to avoid paying external providers. Such students can graduate from their home district without ever leaving home. In most of these cases, students are given computers, books, and even internet service to complete coursework from home.\n\nWith the resources of the internet as a library, and the ease of making online study materials, there is usually a comparatively small requirement for textbooks. Most courses will provide electronic materials free of cost, or included in the course fee. Textbooks are most often required for an exam syllabus course.\n\nAdvocates of online schools and online learning point to a number of advantages:\n\n\nSome disadvantages of virtual school includes:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14457458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14457458", "title": "Women in medicine", "text": "Women in medicine\n\nHistorically and presently, in many parts of the world, women's participation in the profession of medicine (as physicians or surgeons for instance) has been significantly restricted. However, women's informal practice of medicine in roles such as caregivers or as allied health professionals has been widespread. Most countries of the world now provide women with equal access to medical education. However, not all countries ensure equal employment opportunities, and gender equality has yet to be achieved within medical specialties and around the world, despite studies suggesting that female doctors may be providing higher-quality care than male doctors.\n\n In 1540, Henry VIII of England granted the charter for the Company of Barber-Surgeons; while this led to the specialization of healthcare professions (i.e. surgeons and barbers), women were barred from professional practice. Women did, however, continue to practice during this time. They continued to practice without formal training or recognition in England and eventually North America for the next several centuries. Women's participation in the medical professions was generally limited by legal and social practices during the decades while medicine was professionalizing. However, women openly practiced medicine in the allied health professions (nursing, midwifery, etc.), and throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, women made significant gains in access to medical education and medical work through much of the world. These gains were sometimes tempered by setbacks; for instance, Mary Roth Walsh documented a \"decline\" in women physicians in the US in the first half of the twentieth century, such that there were fewer women physicians in 1950 than there were in 1900. However, through the latter half of the twentieth century, women made gains generally across the board. In the United States, for instance, women were 9% of total US medical school enrollment in 1969; this had increased to 20% in 1976. By 1985, women constituted 16% of practicing US physicians.\n\nAt the beginning of the twenty-first century in industrialized nations, women have made significant gains, but have yet to achieve parity throughout the medical profession. Women have achieved parity in medical school in some industrialized countries, since 2003 forming the majority of the United States medical student body. In 2007-2008, women accounted for 49% of medical school applicants and 48.3% of those accepted. According to the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) 48.3% (16,838) of medical degrees awarded in the US in 2009-10 were earned by women, an increase from 26.8% in 1982-3. While more women are taking part in the medical field, a 2013-2014 study reported that there are significantly fewer women in leadership positions within the academic realm of medicine. This study found that women accounted for 16% of deans, 21% of the professors, and 38% of faculty, as compared to their male counterparts.\n\nHowever, the practice of medicine remains disproportionately male overall. In industrialized nations, the recent parity in gender of medical students has not yet trickled into parity in practice. In many developing nations, neither medical school nor practice approach gender parity.\n\nMoreover, there are skews within the medical profession: some medical specialties, such as surgery, are significantly male-dominated, while other specialties are significantly female-dominated, or are becoming so. In the United States, female physicians outnumber male physicians in pediatrics and female residents outnumber male residents in family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, and psychiatry.\n\nWomen continue to dominate in nursing. In 2000, 94.6% of registered nurses in the United States were women. In health care professions as a whole in the US, women numbered approximately 14.8 million, as of 2011.\n\nBiomedical research and academic medical professions—i.e., faculty at medical schools—are also disproportionately male. Research on this issue, called the \"leaky pipeline\" by the National Institutes of Health and other researchers, shows that while women have achieved parity with men in entering graduate school, a variety of discrimination causes them to drop out at each stage in the academic pipeline: graduate school, postdoc, faculty positions, achieving tenure; and, ultimately, in receiving recognition for groundbreaking work. (See women in science for a broader discussion.)\n\nThe glass ceiling is used as a metaphor to convey the undefined obstacles that women and minorities face in the workplace.\n\nOne study surveyed physician mothers and their physician daughters in order to analyze the effect that discrimination and harassment have on the individual and their career. This study included 84% of physician mothers that graduated medical school prior to 1970, with the majority of these physicians graduating in the 1950s and 1960s. The authors of this study stated that discrimination in the medical field persisted after the title VII discrimination legislation was passed in 1965.<ref name=\"10.1089/jwh.2006.0127\">Shrier, Diane K.; Zucker, Alyssa N.; Mercurio, Andrea E.; Landry, Laura J.; Rich, Michael; Shrier, Lydia A. (2007). \"Generation to Generation: Discrimination and Harassment Experiences of Physician Mothers and Their Physician Daughters\". \"Journal of Women's Health\". 16 (6): 1–13. </ref>\nAccording to this study, one third of physician daughters reported experiencing a form of gender discrimination in medical school, field training, and the work environment. This study also stated that both generations equally experienced gender discrimination within their work environments.\n\nThis article provided an overview on the history of gender discrimination, claiming that gender initiated the systematic exclusion of women from medical schools. This was the case until 1970, when the National Organization for Women (NOW) filed a class action lawsuit against all medical schools in the United States.  More specifically, this lawsuit was successful in forcing medical schools to comply to the civil rights legislation. This success was seen by 1975 when the number of women in medicine had nearly tripled, and continued to grow as the years progressed. By 2005, over 25% of physicians and around 50% of medical school students were women. The increase of women in medicine also came with an increase of women identifying as a racial/ethnic minority, yet this population is still largely underrepresented in comparison to the general population of the medical field.\nWithin this specific study, 22% of physician mothers and 24% of physician daughters identified themselves as being an ethnic minority. These women reported experiencing instances of exclusion from career opportunities as a result of their race and gender. \n\nIn an article titled \"I'm too used to it”: A longitudinal qualitative study of third year female medical students' experiences of gendered encounters in medical education,\" the author described how confidence in ability varies based upon gender. According to this article, females tend to have lessened confidence in their abilities as a doctor, yet their performance is equivalent to that of their male counterparts. This study also commented on the impact of power dynamics within medical school, which is established as a hierarchy that ultimately shapes the educational experience.\n\nSpecifically, this article described how power dynamics led to the formation of a “hidden curriculum” in medical school, which revolves around understanding the contribution of gender roles in regards to being a female doctor. According to this article, this position holds females more accountable for their actions as a result of unrealistic expectations set forth by these gender roles, which expects female doctors to take on a nurturing and matronly persona when dealing with patients. The hidden curriculum, according to this article, is an integral aspect of a female's medical education that must be learned in order to tolerate instances of gender discrimination.\n\nOn the topic of power dynamics, another study commented on the nature of sexual harassment, stating that it was most commonly perpetrated within career training stages, by people in positions of power. According to this article, instances of sexual harassment attribute to the high attrition rates of females in the STEM fields.\n\nAnother study describes sexual harassment as a growing problem due to the fact that it goes widely underreported, which is said to be caused by the transient nature of career training, alongside weak policies and the perpetrators holding positions of power over the victim.\n\nWomen have successfully provided the world with information not previously known. A few women who provided knowledge were:\nHelen Brooke Taussig: \"The First Female President of the American Heart Association\"\n\nHelen Brooke Taussig was born on May 24, 1898, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She is most commonly known as the first female president of the American Heart Association Taussig was diagnosed with Dyslexia when she was young. Around the same time, her mother, Edith Guild Taussig (1861-1909) died. Her father, Frank William Taussig (1859-1940), was an economist and educator in the United States. He was also known for creating the \"Foundation of Modern Trade Theory\". Taussig earned a A.B from University of California, Berkeley in 1921. In 1922 she applied at Harvard University's Medical School, and was denied. The University was not accepting women at the time. Instead she graduated from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1927. In her 30s, Taussig grew deaf. In 1930, Taussig was appointed the Head of he Children's Hear Clinic at the Harriet Lane home, which was part of Johns Hopkins University. Due to her inability to hear, Taussig found an alternative method to studying the heartbeat in children by feeling the beat with her hands. This method lead her to discover \"Blue Baby Syndrome\", which was termed so due to the cyanotic hue resembling babies who were thought to be ill. In 1947, a surgeon named Alfred Blalock teamed up with Taussig and wrote an article called, which explored their creation and alternative approach for a stunt-\"Blalock-Taussig Shunt\"- that would help circulate blood from the lungs to the heart. In the article it states, \"The operation here reported and the studies leading thereto were undertaken with the conviction that even though the structure of the heart was grossly abnormal, in many instances it might be possible to alter the course of the circulation in such a manner as to lessen the 'cyanosis' and the resultant disability.\" (Read before the Johns Hopkins Medical Society, March 12, 1945.) Taussig received multiple awards after 1950. In 1954, Taussig received the Albert Lasker award, which is awarded for outstanding contributions to medicine. In 1959, Taussig was acknowledged for being one of the first women who received full professorship to Johns Hopkins University. In 1964, Taussig was awarded the medal of freedom from President Lyndon B. Johnson. Finally, in 1965, Taussig was known as the first women of the American Heart Association, for which she is so prominently known for. To further her interest in pediatrics, nearly a decade and a half later in the 1960s, Taussig remained to advocate for children's health. She was \"responsible for investigating the epidemic of serious congenital limb malformations\". This investigation focused on European children and Taussig had a theory that the malformations were caused by the use of Thalidomide. She resolved this ongoing issue by persuading the Food and Drug Administration to discontinue the use and sale of Thalidomide in the U.S\n\nHelen Flanders Dunbar: \"The \"Mother\" of Holistic Medicine\"\n\nHelen Flanders Dunbar was born in Chicago on May 14, 1902, and Dunbar was the oldest child. Dunbar's mother, Edith Vaughn Flanders (1871-1963), was an Episcopalian clergyman's daughter as well as a professional Genealogist. Dunbar's father, Francis William Dunbar (1868-1939), was very much established as well due to his standing as an electrical engineer, as well as a patent attorney. In her early life, Dunbar's education was strictly limited to tutors and attending private schools. She graduated from Brearley School, which was located in New York City, in 1919, which lead to her enrollment in Bryn Mawr College. At this particular point in her life her interest in theology, philosophy, and medicine. Dunbar met James Henry Leuba at Bryn Mawr College, which sparked her interest due to his standing as a psychologist of religion at the college. In the summer of 1929, after successfully receiving a bachelor's degree in mathematics and psychology from Bryn Mawr, Dunbar continued her education by spending five weeks in Worcester, Massachusetts receiving clinical training. In 1927, Dunbar received a bachelor's degree as \"Magna Cum Laude\" from Union Theological Seminar. This achievement was awarded primarily due to her thesis, \"Methods Training in the Devotional Life Emphasized in the American Churches\". Dunbar also won a travelling Fellowship due to this particular piece of writing. From 1931 until 1936, Dunbar held the position as director of Joint Committee of the New York City Religion and Health of the Federal Council and Churches of the Academy of Medicine. From 1943 until the year before she died, Dunbar wrote an assortment of books including: \"Psychosomatic Diagnosis\" in 1943, \"Mind, Body: Psychosomatic Medicine\" in 1947, \"Your Child's Mind and Body; A practical guide for parents\" in 1949, and \"Illness: the realization of an infant's fantasy with special reference to testing methods\" in 1951. During the year of her death, Dunbar wrote \"Accidents of Life Experience\", \"Basic aspects and applications of the psychology of safety\", and \"Psychiatry in medicine specialties\". Helen Flanders Dunbar died in 1959. She was found face down in her swimming pool.\n\nAs per the documentary “A Midwife’s Tale”, historian of 18th century America, Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, follows the diary of Martha Ballard, which proves to be a telling source of women's roles as medical practitioners. Out of the different occupations women took on around this time, midwifery was the best paid of them all. In the 18th century, households tended to have an abundance of children largely in part to have a helping hand in responsibilities and to combat high mortality rates. Despite the high chance of complications in labor, Martha Ballard, specifically, had high success rates in delivering healthy babies to healthy mothers.\n\nA shift from women midwifery to male obstetrics occurs in the growth of medical practices such as the founding of the American Medical Association. Instead of assisting labor in the basis of an emergency, there were doctors such as Dr. Benjamin Page who wanted to take over the delivery of babies completely; putting midwifery second. This is an example of the growing sense of competition between male physicians and female midwives as a rise in obstetrics took hold. The education of women on the basis of midwifery was stunted by both physicians and public-health reformers, driving midwifery to be seen as out of practice. Societal roles also played a fact in the downfall of the practice in midwifery because women were unable to obtain the education needed for licensing and once married, women were to embrace a domestic lifestyle.\n\nThe involvement of women in the field of medicine has been recorded in several early civilizations. An Egyptian of the Early Dynastic Period or Old Kingdom of Egypt, Merit-Ptah, described in an inscription as \"chief physician\", is the earliest woman named in the history of science. Agamede was cited by Homer as a healer in ancient Greece before the Trojan War. Agnodice was the first female physician to practice legally in 4th century BC Athens. Metrodora was a physician and generally regarded as the first medical writer. Her book, \"On the Diseases and Cures of Women\", was the oldest medical book written by a female and was often referenced by many other female physicians. She credited much of her writings to the ideologies of Hippocrates.\n\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, convents were an important place of education for women, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly research. An example is the German abbess Hildegard of Bingen, whose prolific writings include treatments of various scientific subjects, including medicine, botany and natural history (c.1151-58). She is considered Germany's first female physician.\n\nWomen in the Middle Ages participated in many healing techniques and capacities. According to historical documents, small numbers of women occupied almost all ranks of medical personnel during the period. They worked as herbalists, midwives, surgeons, barber-surgeons, nurses, and traditional empirics. Women treated everyone, not only women as historians once thought. The names of 24 women described as surgeons in Naples between 1273 and 1410 are known, and references have been found to 15 women practitioners, most of them Jewish and none described as midwives, in Frankfurt between 1387 and 1497. \nWomen also engaged in midwifery and healing arts without leaving any trace of their activities in written records, and practiced in rural areas or where there was little access to medical care.\nSociety in the Middle Ages limited women's role as physician. Once universities established faculties of medicine during the thirteenth century, women were excluded from advanced medical education. Licensure began to require clerical vows for which women were ineligible, and healing as a profession became male dominated. In many occasions, women had to fight against accusation of illegal practice done by males, putting into question their real motives. If they were not accused of malpractice, then women were considered \"witches\" by both clerical and civil authorities. Because surgeons and barber-surgeons were often organized into guilds, they could hold out longer against the pressures of licensure. Like other guilds, a number of the barber-surgeon guilds allowed the daughters and wives of their members to take up membership in the guild, generally after the man's death. According to documents, Katherine la surgiene of London, daughter of Thomas the surgeon and sister of William the Surgeon belonged to a guild in 1286. Documentation of female members in the guilds of Lincoln, Norwich, Dublin and York continue until late in the period. Midwives, those who assisted pregnant women through childbirth and some aftercare, included only women. Midwives constituted roughly one third of female medical practitioners. Men did not involve themselves in women's medical care, likewise, women did not involve themselves in men's health care. \nThe southern Italian coastal town of Salerno was an important center of medical learning and practice in the 12th century. There, the physician Trota of Salerno gathered a number of her medical practices in several written collections. One work on women's medicine that was associated with her, the \"De curis mulierum\" (\"On Treatments for Women\") formed the core of what came to be known as the \"Trotula\" ensemble, a compendium of three texts that circulated throughout medieval Europe. Trota herself gained a reputation that spread as far as France and England. There are also references in the writings of other Salernitan physicians to the \"mulieres Salernitane\" (\"Salernitan women\"), which give some idea of local empirical practices.\n\nDorotea Bucca was another distinguished Italian physician. She held a chair of philosophy and medicine at the University of Bologna for over forty years from 1390. Other Italian women whose contributions in medicine have been recorded include Abella, Jacqueline Felice de Almania, Alessandra Giliani, Rebecca de Guarna, Margarita, Mercuriade (14th century), Constance Calenda, Clarice di Durisio (15th century), Constanza, Maria Incarnata and Thomasia de Mattio.\n\n\nFor the medieval Islamic world, little specific information is known about female medical practitioners although it is likely that women were regularly involved in medical practice in some capacity. Male medical writers refer to the presence of female practitioners (singular, \"ṭabība\") in describing certain procedures or situations. For example, the late 10th/early 11th century Andalusi physician and surgeon al-Zahrawi, in explaining how to excise bladder stones, notes that the procedure is difficult for male doctors practicing on female patients: because of the need to touch the genitalia, the male practitioner must either find a female doctor who can perform the procedure, or a eunuch physician, or a midwife who takes instruction from the male surgeon. In other words, even though direct evidence for female practitioners is rare, their existence can be inferred. As al-Zahrawi's example also suggests, midwives played an important role in the delivery of women's healthcare. For these practitioners, there is more detailed information, both in terms of the prestige of their craft (ibn Khaldun calls it a noble craft, \"something necessary in civilization\") and in terms of biographical information on historic women. To date, no known medical treatise written by a woman in the medieval Islamic world has been identified.\n\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine based on the use of herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage and other forms of therapy has been practiced in China for thousands of years. However, Western Medicine was introduced to China in the 19th Century, mainly by medical missionaries sent from various Christian mission organizations, such as the London Missionary Society (Britain), the Methodist Church (Britain) and the Presbyterian Church (US). Benjamin Hobson (1816-1873), a medical missionary sent by the London Missionary Society in 1839, set up a highly successful Wai Ai Clinic (惠愛醫館) in Guangzhou, China. The Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese (香港華人西醫書院) was founded in 1887 by the London Missionary Society, with its first graduate (in 1892) being Sun Yat-sen (孫中山). Sun later led the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, which changed China from an empire to a republic. The Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese was the forerunner of the School of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong, which started in 1911.\n\nDue to the social custom that men and women should not be near to one another, women of China were reluctant to be treated by Western male doctors. This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors. One of these was Sigourney Trask of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who set-up a hospital in Fuzhou during the mid-19th century. Trask also arranged for a local girl, Hü King Eng, to study medicine at Ohio Wesleyan Female College, with the intention that Hü would return to practise western medicine in Fuzhou. After graduation, Hü became the resident physician at Fuzhou's Woolston Memorial Hospital in 1899 and trained several female physicians. Another female medical missionary Dr. Mary H. Fulton (1854-1927) was sent by the Foreign Missions Board of the Presbyterian Church (USA) to found the first medical college for women in China. Known as the Hackett Medical College for Women (夏葛女子醫學院), this College was located in Guangzhou, China, and was enabled by a large donation from Mr. Edward A. K. Hackett (1851-1916) of Indiana, US. The College was dedicated in 1902 and offered a four-year curriculum. By 1915, there were more than 60 students, mostly in residence. Most students became Christians, due to the influence of Dr. Fulton. The College was officially recognized, with its diplomas marked with the official stamp of the Guangdong provincial government. The College was aimed at the spreading of Christianity and modern medicine and the elevation of Chinese women's social status. The David Gregg Hospital for Women and Children (also known as Yuji Hospital 柔濟醫院) was affiliated with this College. The graduates of this College included CHAU Lee-sun (周理信, 1890-1979) and WONG Yuen-hing (黃婉卿), both of whom graduated in the late 1910s and then practiced medicine in the hospitals in Guangdong province.\n\nIn the early modern era, following the Middle Ages, accuracy in documentation of women present in the health field increased. This increase in documentation gave a clear representation of women engaged in the healthcare of London residents.\n\nWhen women were routinely forbidden from medical school, they sought to form their own medical schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1970s marked a great increase of women entering and graduating from medical school. From 1930 to 1970, a period of 40 years, about 14,000 women graduated from medical school. From 1970 to 1980, a period of 10 years, over 20,000 women graduated from medical school. This increase of women in the medical field was due to both political and cultural changes.\n\nTwo laws in the United States lifted restrictions for women in the medical field -- Title IX of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1972 and the Public Health Service Act of 1975, banning discrimination on grounds of gender. In November 1970, the Assembly of the Association of American Medical Colleges rallied for equal rights in the medical field.\n\nAt the same time, women's ideas about themselves and their relation to the medical field were shifting due to the women's movement.\n\nA sharp increase of women in the medical field led to developments in doctor patient relationships, changes in terminology and theory. One area of medical practice that was challenged and changed was gynecology. Wendy Kline talks about the blurring of \"clinical\" and \"sexual\" that occurred in the medical field in the late 40s into the 60s, particularly in gynecology. Kline says that \"to ensure that young brides were ready for the wedding night, they [doctors] used the pelvic exam as a form of sex instruction .\" In Ellen Frankfort's book \"Vaginal Politics\", Frankfort talks about the \"shame\" and \"humiliation\" felt during a pap test; \"I was naked, he was dressed; I was lying down, he was standing up; I was quiet, he was giving orders \"\n\nWith higher numbers of women enrolled in medical school, medical practices like gynecology were challenged and changed. One medical student is quoted in Kline's book as saying, \"Since I experienced my own exams as a humiliating procedure, I feared inflicting the same humiliation on another person.\" In 1972 the University of Iowa Medical School instituted a new training program for pelvic and breast examinations. Students would act both as the doctor and the patient, allowing each student to understand the procedure and create a more gentle, respectful examination. This method was quite different from the previous practice in which doctors were taught to assert their power over patients. With changes in ideologies and practices throughout the 70s, by 1980 over 75 schools had adopted this new method.\n\nWith women entering the medical field and women's rights movements came also the women's health movement which sought alternative methods of health care for women. This came through the creation of self-help books, most notably \"Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women\". This book gave women a \"manual\" to help understand their body. It challenged hospital treatment, and doctors' practices. Aside from self-help books, many help centres were opened: birth centres run by midwives, safe abortion centres, and classes for educating women on their bodies, all with the aim of providing non-judgmental, warm, and comfortable care for women. Kline speaks to this claim women were taking on their body in relation to the medical world; women felt that \"not only should women have access to information about their bodies... they should also help to create this knowledge.\" The women's health movement, along with women involved in the medical field, opened the doors for research and awareness for female illness like breast cancer and cervical cancer.\n\nWhile scholars in the history of medicine had developed some study of women in the field—biographies of pioneering women physicians were common prior to the 1960s—the study of women in medicine took particular root with the advent of the women's movement in the 1960s, and in conjunction with the women's health movement. Two publications in 1973 were critical in establishing the women's health movement and scholarship about women in medicine: First, the publication of \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\" in 1973 by the Boston Women's Health Collective, and second, \"Witches, Midwives, and Nurses: A History of Female Healers\", a short paper by Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English also in 1973. The Ehrenreich/English paper examined the history of women in medicine as the professionalization of the field excluded women, particularly midwives, from the practice. Ehrenreich and English later expanded the work into a full-length book, \"For Her Own Good\", which connected the exclusion of women from the practice of medicine to sexist medical practices; this text and \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\" became key texts in the women's health movement. The English/Ehrenreich text laid out some early insights about the professionalization of medicine and the exclusion of women from the profession, and numerous scholars, such as Diana Elizabeth Long, have greatly built upon and expanded this work.\n\n\n\n"}
