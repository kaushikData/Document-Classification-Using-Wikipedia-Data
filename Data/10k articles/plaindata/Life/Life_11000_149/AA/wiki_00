It began with the apprehension of Rabbi David Wax, and culminated in the arrest of a group of rabbis from New York under the direction of Mendel Epstein, including Jay Goldstein, Binyamin Stimler, and Martin Wolmark, who were involved in the planned kidnapping and torture of a fictitious Jewish husband in Middlesex County, New Jersey, with the purpose of obtaining from him a \"get\". Epstein and his men were found guilty of attempted kidnapping in 2015, and were sentenced to prison, while Epstein's son, David Epstein, was acquitted.\n\nA Jewish man is allowed to divorce his wife for virtually any reason by first receiving her permission, and then giving her a get. If she is unwilling, and his complaint against her is substantial, he can pursue a heter meah rabbanim and remarry, although one is rarely awarded.\nA Jewish woman seeking a divorce from her husband must present her complaint to a beth din with the implication of a serious physical blemish or character defect. The husband must be willing to divorce his wife, for if he gives the get unwillingly, the divorce is invalid, and any future offspring of the wife would be considered mamzers. If the circumstances truly warrant a divorce and the husband is unwilling, the dayan has the prerogative of instituting community shunning measures to \"coerce him until he agrees,\" with physical force being reserved only for the rarest of cases.\n\nIt was in this grey area of halakha that in the mid-1980s a rabbi from Brooklyn, New York, Mendel Epstein, began to advocate for women seeking religious divorces from their husbands. Dubbed The Prodfather by the press due to his boast of using a cattle prod against his victims, Epstein started a divorce-gang which coerced these men to give the \"get\"s through the use of violence. Although U.S. laws prohibit kidnapping, assault, and torture, some rabbis have gone on record anonymously to sanction these otherwise \"inhumane\" acts against \"angry husbands.\" If a man got so scared from this treatment as to suffer a heart attack, Epstein would instruct his gang to \"Take a right turn and let him die.\"\n\nIn 1991, Father's Rights activist Monty Weinstein staged a protest with twenty-five people outside Epstein's home, with some carrying signs that read \"Stop Mendel Epstein!\"\n\n\n\nIn October 2010, David Wax and his wife Judy were arrested for their part in the Bryskman kidnapping, and Wax subsequently agreed to testify as a government witness, claiming Epstein was the head of the operation and that his son David was present in the bedroom during the Bryskman beating. Their relationship dated back to the 1980s, when Epstein had forced a divorce for Wax's sister. The Bryskman case was what led federal authorities in New Jersey to begin their investigation of Mendel Epstein for his role in the crime.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, a woman dialed Martin Wolmark, an accomplice of Epstein, and told him a story about a husband who refused to give her a get. Wolmark said:\n\nOn August 14, 2013, she visited Epstein in Lakewood with another man she said was her brother. Epstein said to the two visitors:\n\nThe man then asked about Epstein's effectiveness, to which he replied:\n\nEpstein explained he would need $10,000 to approve the coercion at the beth din, and $60,000 for the \"tough guys\", who would use karate, rope, a screwdriver, and plastic bags over the men's heads to get them to cooperate. And if all else fails, then:\n\nEpstein also told the woman that he would not be present at the attack, planning instead to be out and about, and suggested that she do the same, explaining that being seen in public would provide them with an alibi.\n\nThe man and woman turned out to be undercover FBI agents.\n\nOn October 9, 2013, 8 men wearing Halloween masks, ski masks, and bandanas – one wore a Metallica T-shirt on top of his clothes – came to a warehouse in Middlesex County, New Jersey, where they flexed and shadow-boxed as they waited for their prey, the 'recalcitrant husband' who did not exist. Suddenly, federal agents burst in and arrested the would-be kidnappers. Epstein was arrested separately in Brooklyn.\n\nDuring a federal court hearing the following day in Trenton, New Jersey, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Gribko told a judge, \"They didn't do it out of religious conviction. They did it for money.\"\n\nOn May 6, 2014, Wax pleaded guilty in federal court in New Jersey to conspiracy to commit kidnapping. He named the men arrested the previous October as his accomplices.\n\nThe trial of the main defendants commenced on February 18, 2015 at the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in Trenton. On April 21, they appeared before District Judge Freda L. Wolfson, whereupon Mendel Epstein was convicted of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, while accomplices Jay Goldstein and Binyamin Stimler were additionally convicted of attempted kidnapping. David Epstein was acquitted, in part by defence attorney Henry Mazurek's contention that David was in a business meeting in Cincinnati during Usher Chaimowitz's beating.\n\nOn December 14, Martin Wolmark, who had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit extortion, was sentenced to more than 3 years in prison. The next day, at his own sentencing, Mendel Epstein told the judge: \n\nEpstein and Stimler were sentenced to 10 years and 3 years respectively. Wolfson said during the proceeding that \"No one is permitted to commit acts of violence against another,\" and that the sentence was necessary in order to deter others in the Orthodox Jewish community from engaging in similar paid vigilantism.\n\nOne day later, Goldstein was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. Six other co-defendants also pleaded guilty before trial, and were sentenced to up to 4 years.\n\nOn January 12, 2016, David Wax was sentenced by Wolfson to 7 years imprisonment.\n\nRabbinical judge David Eidensohn of Monsey, New York said, \"I'm shocked that people who call themselves rabbis would get involved in coercion.\" According to Eidensohn, if a woman obtains a get in such a manner and remarries, \"her marriage is not legal and she would be considered living in sin. If she has children, the children are considered born out of wedlock, and that's considered a disgrace in the community.\"\n\nSamuel Heilman, professor of sociology and Jewish studies at Queens College said, \"Using force, that's the way it used to be done centuries ago. Most Jews don't operate like that anymore, but in this community... it's a sort of fundamentalist view.\"\n\nMoshe David Tendler, rabbi and professor of medical ethics at Yeshiva University said, \"The idea that a beth din can issue an order for coercion is baloney, a hoax.\" While conceding that he had \"been with [Epstein] on matters,\" Tendler nevertheless considered him \"unreliable.\"\n\n\n\n \n"}

Prior to her solo debut in the music scene, A-fu was a member of Lazy Bomb, an indie band, and a demo singer. She is known for her cover version of \"Nothin' on You\" by B.o.B and Bruno Mars, which drew wide attention on YouTube in 2010. In May 2011, A-fu released her debut studio album, \"That's How It Is\", for which she received a nomination for Best New Artist at the 23rd Golden Melody Awards.\n\nBorn in Hsinchu City on 20 June 1987, A-fu grew up in the countryside in Xiangshan District and in Changhua County. Both her parents run a rental car business together, and as they were often busy with work when she was young, A-fu and her elder sister, Hsing Ju, spent much of their childhood under the care of their aunt. Despite this, A-fu still maintains a close relationship with her mother and grew up influenced by her mother's love for music, in particular songs by Teresa Teng. At a young age, A-fu entered in singing and recitation competitions. Also, at her mother's request, she learned the standard Mandarin enunciation by watching the Taiwanese educational programme \"The Daily Characters\" (每日一字) hosted by news presenter Lee Yen-chiu, which perhaps, has shaped her distinctive vocals, in a way.\n\nShe attended Kuang-Fu High School, a comprehensive high school in Hsinchu, and graduated from Shih Hsin University with a degree in public relations and advertising in 2010.\n\nDuring her college years, A-fu was the lead singer of an indie band called Lazy Bomb. The band released a self-titled EP in November 2007 and disbanded shortly after. Around this time, A-fu met music producer AL (何官錠), who is also a member and keyboard player of the pop rock band Six Plus (六甲樂團). She started collaborating with AL as a demo singer. The first demo which she recorded, titled \"Sheng Sheng Man\" (聲聲慢), was chosen as the ending theme song for the first season of the Chinese TV series \"Justice Bao\". The \"Zhong guo feng\" music style of the song, coupled with A-fu's crystal-clear voice and diction, generated considerable buzz among the Chinese netizens. Soon after, A-fu's singing caught the attention of veteran host Chang Hsiao-yen, who later signed A-fu to her record label Forward Music. While awaiting the release of her debut album, A-fu garnered media attention after uploading her first video on YouTube in September 2010, her cover version of B.o.B and Bruno Mars's \"Nothin' on You\", which had racked up more than a million views within a week. She followed with more covers of popular hits, which includes \"Bizarre Love Triangle\", \"Qing Hua Ci\" (青花瓷) by Jay Chou, Bruno Mars's \"Just the Way You Are\" and so forth. In December 2010, A-fu was featured as a backup singer during Stella Chang's comeback concert in Taiwan.\n\nA-fu's debut album, \"That's How It Is\", was released on 27 May 2011 and features a studio version of \"Sheng Sheng Man\" and her cover of \"Nothin' on You\". The album sold more than 25,000 copies in Taiwan within a month of its release. To further promote the album, A-fu performed a sold-out show at the Riverside Live House in Taipei on 25 June 2011, with Van Fan appearing as guest performer. On 3 July 2011, A-fu made a guest appearance at Jam Hsiao's mini-concert at Tamsui Fisherman's Wharf, performing \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Wei Tian Ci\" (未填詞). In 2012, A-fu was nominated for Best New Artist at the 23rd Golden Melody Awards but lost to Ilid Kaolo.\n\nHer next release, an extended play titled \"Happiness Is Around Us\", was released on 7 March 2012. The second single off of the album, \"Where Is The Love?\", a self-composed track, was featured as an insert song in the drama series \"Big Red Riding Hood\".\n\nOn 7 June 2013, A-fu released her second studio album, \"Sky Island\", which debuted at number one on the Five Music Mandarin Album sales chart. It includes the track \"Rang Wo Ai Shang Wo\" (讓我愛上我) from the soundtrack album for the film \"Step Back to Glory\" (志氣).

They were first placed between heavy boards to crush their bones, and later beheaded.\n\nThere may have been a political aspect to the persecution, since the king was attempting to establish Mazdeism as the state religion and judged Christians as the natural allies of the Romans. In 339-340 the king began the prosecution with the help of Jews and Magi of bishop of Seleucia and Ctesifonte, Simeone Bar Sabbã, having accused him in the friendly support of Roman Empire. The historian Sozomen wrote about 22 martyrs who were tortured together. In his book he mentioned Abdas and Abdjesus in 15-th and 16-th places in his list of martyrs. This information is worth of trusting because it was written in less than 100 years after their death. ll of the martyrs were first interrogated by the king but later he charged his brother Ardashir to continue.

{"id": "430209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=430209", "title": "Ali al-Hadi", "text": "Ali al-Hadi\n\nAlī ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Alī (; 829-868 C.E. ) commonly called al-Hadi (the one who shows right path) and Alī an-Naqī was the tenth of the Twelve Imams after his father Muhammad al-Jawad and before his son Hasan al-Askari. He remained in Medina teaching until the age of 30 when he was summoned to Samarra by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil. There he was treated roughly by the caliph and his successors until, according to Shiite accounts, he was poisoned through intrigue of Al-Mu'tazz the Abbasid caliph, in 254/868, and was buried in Samarra.\n\nAccording to the most accurate reports he was born in 828 in a village near Medina called Sorayya to the ninth Shiite Imām, Muhammad al-Taqi, (also known as Imam Muhammad al-Jawad), and Lady Samānah or Susan, who was originally a Berber (from Northwest Africa). His father bestowed upon him the surname \"Abul-Hasan\", after the surnames given to his grandfather Ali al-Ridha and his great grandfather Musa al-Kadhim. To differentiate between these three Abul Hasan, narrators usually call Musa al-Kadhim, abul Hasan the first, call Ali al-Ridha, Abul Hasan the second and call al-Hadi Abul Hasan the third.\n\nAfter his father's death in 835, Ali al-Hadi assumed the official role of Imamate at the age of 7 or 8. The followers of his father were in agreement on his Imamate, except for a minor group who gathered around his older brother Musa who when dissociated himself from them, they turned to al-Hadi. Historians have mentioned that after his father's assassination at the will of Al-Mu'tasim, the Abbasid caliph ordered Umar bin al-Faraj to find a teacher in Medina for the young Imam (that must be one of the enemies of the Ahlul Bayt) in order to prevent Shiites from meeting him. He found al-Junaydi for this task, however, al-Junaydi often reported on the Imam's intelligence saying that the boy would provide perspectives on literature and understanding of the Quran and the revelations within. Al-Junaydi, impressed by him, concluded that it could only be by divine causes that the boy could be so knowledgeable, as a result, he dropped the animosity he had held towards the family of the prophet.\n\nThroughout the later years of his Imamate, which coincided with the eight remaining years of the caliphate of Al-Mansur, and five years of the caliphate of next caliph Al-Wathiq, he lived peacefully in Medina engaging himself in teaching a large number of pupils mostly from Iraq, Persia, and Egypt. later on, however, the new Caliph, Al-Mutawakkil, became suspicious of the young Imam and decided to watch him more closely.\n\nAfter Al-Mutawakkil came to throne, the governor of Medina, ʿAbdallāh ibn Moḥammad, wrote the caliph warning him about the activity of al-Hadi saying that he was given money with which he could buy weapons that could be used to revolt against the Caliph. When al-Hadi learned of what Abdullah bin Muhammad had told the caliph, he sent a letter to Mutawakkil defending himself against the accusations and complained about the governor. Apparently convinced of the harmless piousness of al-Hadi, Motawakkel wrote back to al-Hadi stating that he had deposed the governor. He nevertheless asked the Imam to come to Samarra (a military camp, not far from Baghdad which was the capital of Abbasids at the time). At the same time, Mutawakkil ordered Yahya ibn Harthama, the captain of the guard, to go to Medina both to investigate Abdullah's claims and to bring al-Hadi to Samarra. Yahya then searched the Imam's house and found nothing more than copies of the Quran and other religious books. It is said that when the imam approached Baghdad many people gathered to see him. The governor of the city himself rode out of the city to welcome him and stayed a part of night with him. At Sammera, however, the caliph did not immediately receive him, though assigned a house for his staying.\n\nEven though Mutawakkil had no reason to be suspicious of al-Hadi, he insisted that he stay in Samarra under house arrest. According to Madelung, he was still able to move in the city and communicate with his followers, giving them instructions or receiving through them the annual Khums (the financial contributions of the faithful).\n\nYahya ibn Harthama, the captain of the guard, is narrated to have reported his experience as follows: \"The Caliph Mutawakkel sent me to Medina with orders to bring Ali ibn Muhammad to answer certain accusations that had been made against him. When I arrived, his household made such wailing and lamentation as I had never heard. I tried to quiet them and assured them that I had received no orders to do him any harm. And when I searched the house where he lived, I found only a Quran, books of prayer and such things. So while I took him away, I offered him my services and showed him very high respect. But one day on the journey, when the sky was clear and the sun just rising, Ali put on a cloak when he mounted his horse and knotted the animal's tail. I was surprised at this, but it was only a little while afterwards that a cloud came up and there was a regular torrent of rain. Then Ali turned to me and said, \"I know that you did not understand that you saw me do, and that you imagine that I have had some unusual knowledge of this affair. It is not, however, as you supposed, but as I was brought up in a desert, I know the winds that come before rain. This morning the wind blew which does not deceive, and I noticed the odor of rain and so prepared for it.\" On our arrival in Baghdad, our first visit was to Ishak ibn Ibrahim, of the family of Tahir, who was the governor of the city. He said to me, \"O Abu Yahya, this man (Ali) is a descendant of the Apostle of God. You know Mutawakkil, and have influence with him, but if you urge him to kill this man, the Prophet, himself will be your enemy.\" I replied that I saw nothing in the conduct of Ali except what was altogether praiseworthy.\nI went on to Samarra, where I saw Wasif, the Turk, for I was one of his intimate friends. \"I swear before God,\" he said to me, \"if a single hair of the head of this man falls, I will myself demand satisfaction.\" I was somewhat surprised at the attitude taken by these men, and when I informed Mutawakkil of what I had heard in praise of the Imam, he gave him a handsome present and treated him with all sorts of honor.\"\n\nAl-Hadi contributed to the books of \"argumentation\" that were compiled by Shiite scholars among which was a theological treatise on human Free Will and some other short texts and statements ascribed to al-Hadi are quoted by Abū Muḥammad al-Ḥasan ibn ʻAlī ibn al-Ḥusayn ibn Shuʻbah al-Harrānī.\n\nIt is said that once a scholar came in where al-Hadi had a meeting with masters of Hashemite (the clan prophet Muhammad had belonged to). Al-Hadi seated the scholar beside himself and treated him with great respect. The Hashemite protested saying: \"why do you prefer him to the masters of Banu Hashim?’\nAl-Hadi said: \"Beware to be from those whom God has said about, \"Have you not considered those who are given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of God that it might\ndecide between them, then a part of them turn back and they withdraw\".\nDo you accept the Book of God as a judge?\" asked al-Hadi. They all said, \"O son of the messenger of God, we do.\" Then al-Hadi tried to prove his stance by saying, \"Has God not said \"God will exalt those of you who believe, and those who are given knowledge, in high degrees?\"\nGod does not accept for a knowledgeable believer but to be preferred to an unknowledgeable believer, just as He wants a believer to be preferred to an unbeliever. God has said, \"God will exalt those of you who believe and those who are given knowledge, in high degrees\". Has He said, \"God will exalt those, who are given honor of lineage, in high degrees?\" God has said, \"Are those who know and those who do not know alike?\" Then, how do you deny my honoring him for what God has honored him?\"\n\nOn one occasion, al-Mutawakkil organized a conference to be held in his palace with theologians and jurisprudents he had invited. He had asked Ya'qub ibn Isaak known as ibn as-Sikkit to ask al-Hadi the questions that he didn't think the Imam could answer. One of the questions was that why God had sent Moses with the rod and white hand, sent Jesus with the healing of the blind and leprous and giving life to the dead, and sent Muhammad with the Quran and sword?\nAl-Hadi's answer goes as follows:\n\"Allah sent Moses with the rod and white hand in a time where the predominant thing among people was magic. Therefore, Moses came to them with that and defeated their magic, dazed them, and proved authority over them. And Allah sent Jesus Christ with the healing of the blind and leprous and the giving of life to the dead by the will of Allah in a time where the predominant thing among people was medicine. Therefore, Jesus Christ came to them with that and defeated and dazed them. And Allah sent Muhammad with the Quran and sword in a time where the predominant things among people were sword and poetry. Therefore, Muhammad came to them with the Quran and sword and dazed their poetry, defeated their sword, and proved authority over them.\" \n\nYahya bin Aktham was another scholar who was invited to try the imam. It is said that after al-Hadi's answer to Yahya's questions, he turned to al-Mutawakkil and advised him saying, \"We do not like you to ask this man about anything after my questions to him … In showing his knowledge there will be strengthening to Rafida (the Shiite).\" One of the questions is the following:\n\n\"Tell me why Ali (the first Shiite Imam) killed the people of (the battle of) Siffin …whether they were attacking or fleeing and he finished off the wounded, but on the day of al-Jamal (Battle of the Camel) he did not ... Rather, he said, \"Whoever keeps to his house will be safe.\" Why did he do that? If the first decision was right, so the second would be wrong.\"\n\nAl-Hadi replied: \"The Imam of the people of the Battle of the Camel was killed and they had no leader to refer to. They went back to their homes without fighting, deceiving, or spying. They were satisfied (after the defeat) not to fight any further. But the people of Siffin belonged to a prepared company with a leader who supplied them with spears, armor, and swords, caring for them, giving them good gifts, preparing great monies for them, visiting their sick, curing their wounded, giving sumpters to their footers, helping their needy, and returning them to the fight…\"\n\nWhether or not it was possible to see God, was one of the common issues discussed at the time of al-Hadi who believed it was impossible to see Him. He argued that \"seeing is not possible if there is no air (space) between the seer and the seen thing through which sight goes through. If there is no air and no light between the seer and the seen thing, there will be no sight. When the seer equals the seen thing in the cause of sight between them, sight takes place, but those who compare the seer (man) to Allah, they are mistaken because they liken Allah to man…for effects must relate to causes.\"\n\nAnother issue that the Imam dealt with was the belief that God has a body (the embodiment of God). Al-Hadi chastised those who believed it and stated that, \"He, who claims that Allah is a body, is not from us, and we are free from him in this world and the after-world...body (substance) is created, and it is Allah Who has created and embodied it.\" To attribute Allah with embodiment is to characterize Him with need and to limit Him to a body. Essentially, it is wrong to equate God with created things due to His nature as our creator.\nAli al-Hadi also expressed strong feelings about the impossibility of describing God's Essence. The rationale behind his objection was that God is so great that, as humans, we are incapable of conceiving how truly amazing He is, and that the only one that can truly describe God is God Himself. He then uses this as a segue into the belief that true Muslims, the Prophet, and the infallible imams cannot be described either, because their obedience to God draws them closer to the Essence of God, and descriptions cannot wholly encompass their virtuous qualities that result from submitting to God.\n\nIt is said that Mutawakkil showed courtesy toward the imam in Samarra, and even preferred his judgment to other Faqihs; in the same time however, he troubled and even tried to kill the Imam.\nMutawakkel was envious of the Imam because Imam’s position was exalted among the public. He wanted to belittle the Imam. His vizier counseled him, recommending him to give up, because it would make the public blame and criticize him. But he paid no attention to his vizier. To try to humiliate the Imam, Motawakkil ordered that the Imam along with the officials and notables, (so that it wouldn't look like the act was intended for the imam) dismount and travel on foot during a hot summer day while the caliph remained mounted on his horse. Zuraqa the chamberlain of al-Mutawakkil has narrated that he saw the Imam who had almost suffered a heat stroke, was breathing and sweating hard, so he approached him to calm him down by saying \"Your cousin (Mutawakkil) did not intend to hurt you particularly.\" Al-Hadi looked at him and said \"Stop that!\" And then recited this Quranic verse, \"Enjoy yourselves in your abode for three days, that is a promise not to be belied\". The \"promise\" here refers to the punishment which is mentioned in the previous verse for unjust people . Zuraqa related that he had a Shiite teacher who had been among his intimate friends. Zuraqa says \"when I went home, I sent for him. When he came to me, I told him about what I heard from the Imam. He changed color and said to me, \"Be careful and store all what you have! Al-Mutawakkil shall die or be killed after three days.\" I was affected by his speech and asked him to leave. Then I thought with myself and said that it would not harm me to take precautions. If something like that happened, I would have taken my precaution, and if not, I would lose nothing. I went to the house of al-Mutawakkil and took all my money. I deposited them with one of my acquaintances.\" Within three days of that event, plotters assassinated the caliph; one of the assassins was actually his son, al-Muntasir.\n\nAnother account of this prediction stated that the Imam was imprisoned by the caliph, and it was that act which provoked the Imam to foretell of his death.\n\nAli al-Hadi was given a vast number of descriptive names throughout his life, among which al-Naqi (the pure one), al-Hadi (the Guide) were the most famous. However al-Askari (military; due to the town he had to live in was a military camp), Faqīh (jurisprudent), al-Aalim (knowledgeable) and At-Tayyib (generous, kind-hearted, good-natured…) were also among his epithets. \nIt is said that al-Hadi exhibited extreme generosity, though himself at times had no money to pay with either. An example of which is an account that describes how a nomadic man came to the Imam to tell him of how he was heavily in debt and in need of assistance. Al-Hadi, being short of money himself, gave the man a note saying that he was in debt to the nomad, and instructed him to meet the Imam in a place where he had a meeting, and to insist that the Imam pay back the recorded debt. The nomad did as he was told, and the Imam apologized to the nomad in front of those at the meeting for being incapable of paying him back. The officials at the meeting reported the Imam's debt to the caliph, al-Mutawakkil, who then sent the Imam 30,000 dirhams, with which he then presented to the nomad.\n\nIn Twelver Shiism, he is described as being endowed with the knowledge of the languages of the Persians, Slavs, Indians and Nabataeans in addition to foreknowing unexpected storms and as accurately prophesying other events. In the presence of al-Mutawakkil, he unmasked a woman falsely claiming to be Zaynab, daughter of Ali, by descending into a lion's cage in order to prove that lions do not harm true descendants of Ali (a similar miracle is attributed to his great-grandfather, Musa al-Kadhim). Al-Hadi's miracles made some people to believe the claim of some Heretics like Ibn Hasakah who preached to people that al-Hadi was in fact God, and that they themselves were prophets sent by the imam to guide the Muslims. It is quoted from al-Hadi as denying them and instructing people about the extremists saying \"Desert them! May Allah curse them. Block them up into narrow passages and if you find any of them, split his head with stone!\"\n\nAl-Hadi was poisoned by an agent of Al-Mu'tazz, who was the Abbasid leader of the time, and passed away in the year 254 of the Islamic calendar (868 CE). His son Hasan al-Askari became the Imam after him.\n\nThe tomb of al-Hadi, which became also the tomb of his son Hasan al-Askari afterwards, is an important place of Shiite pilgrimage. It was bombed in February 2006 and badly damaged. Another attack was executed on 13 June 2007, which led to the destruction of the two minarets of the shrine. Authorities in Iraq said Al Qaeda was responsible for the attack.\n\nAl-Hadi's son Abū Jafar Muhammad, is said to had died before his father in Samarra. His other sons were Hasan and Ja'far, from whom Hasan became the next Imam. According to some sources and pedigrees belonged to Naqvis, however, four more sons namely Hussain, Abdullah, Zaid, and Mussa are attributed to the tenth Imam.\n\nBesides Hasan al-Askari, three sons, Hussain, Muhammad, and Jafar, as well as one daughter, Ailia, from different wives have been mentioned by various biographic scholars, including Shaikh Mufeed. Issues of these sons are traceable in different pedigree books published by researchers from time to time.\n\n\n"}

The family had evidently embraced the Fatimid regime after the overthrow of the Aghlabids in 909, and his father Ali had served the Fatimids with distinction, being killed by the rebellious populace in Agrigento in 938. Along with his brother Hasan, Ammar belonged to the close circle around Jawdhar, the powerful chamberlain and chief minister of Caliph al-Mansur Billah.\n\nIn spring or early summer 956, Caliph al-Mu'izz dispatched him to Sicily at the head of a fleet, to confront the Byzantines. Ammar inflicted a heavy defeat on the Byzantine fleet, and the Fatimids under Ammar's brother Hasan and Jawhar al-Siqilli scored further victories and raided Calabria. The local Byzantine commander, Marianos Argyros, visited the caliphal court and arranged for truce, but it was soon broken and warfare resumed. In spring 957, Ammar crossed from Sicily to Calabria, but the Fatimids themselves suffered heavy losses in a storm. Another effort by Argyros to renew the truce in autumn failed, and in the next year, Ammar and Hasan defeated his forces in Sicily; but soon after, as the Fatimid fleet was returning from Calabria to Sicily, it was again wrecked in a storm off Palermo, in which Ammar perished (on 24 September 958, according to the \"Cambridge Chronicle\"; al-Maqrizi places these events two years earlier). As a result, al-Mu'izz accepted new Byzantine proposals for a renewed five-year truce. Ammar's body was recovered among the wreckage, and buried by his brother Hasan in Sicily.\n\nAmmar's son Hasan also served against the Byzantines in Sicily and Italy before going to newly conquered Egypt, where he rose to become chief minister under Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 996–997, before being overthrown and executed by Bajarwan.\n\n"}
{"id": "191353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191353", "title": "Azathoth", "text": "Azathoth\n\nAzathoth is a deity in the Cthulhu Mythos and Dream Cycle stories of writer H. P. Lovecraft and other authors. He is the ruler of the Outer Gods.\n\nThe first recorded mention of Azathoth was in a note Lovecraft wrote to himself in 1919 that read simply, \"AZATHOTH—hideous name\". Mythos editor Robert M. Price argues that Lovecraft could have combined the biblical names Anathoth (Jeremiah's home town) and Azazel—mentioned by Lovecraft in \"The Dunwich Horror\". Price also points to the alchemical term \"Azoth\", which was used in the title of a book by Arthur Edward Waite, the model for the wizard Ephraim Waite in Lovecraft's \"The Thing on the Doorstep\".\n\nAnother note Lovecraft made to himself later in 1919 refers to an idea for a story: \"A terrible pilgrimage to seek the nighted throne of the far daemon-sultan Azathoth.\" In a letter to Frank Belknap Long, Lovecraft ties this plot germ to \"Vathek\", a novel by William Beckford about a supernatural caliph. Lovecraft's attempts to work this idea into a novel floundered (a 500-word fragment survives, first published under the title \"Azathoth\" in the journal \"Leaves\" in 1938), although Lovecraftian scholar Will Murray suggests that Lovecraft recycled the idea into his Dream Cycle novella \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\", written in 1926.\n\nPrice sees another inspiration for Azathoth in Lord Dunsany's Mana-Yood-Sushai, from \"The Gods of Pegana\", a creator deity \"who made the gods and thereafter rested.\" In Dunsany's conception, MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI sleeps eternally, lulled by the music of a lesser deity who must drum forever, \"for if he cease for an instant then MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI will start awake, and there will be worlds nor gods no more.\" This oblivious creator god accompanied by supernatural musicians is a clear prototype for Azathoth, Price argues.\n\nAside from the title of the novel fragment, \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\" was the first fiction by Lovecraft to mention Azathoth:\n\nLovecraft referred to Azathoth again in \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" (1931), where the narrator relates that he \"started with loathing when told of the monstrous nuclear chaos beyond angled space which the \"Necronomicon\" had mercifully cloaked under the name of Azathoth\". Here \"nuclear\" most likely refers to Azathoth's central location at the nucleus of the cosmos and not to nuclear energy, which did not truly come of age until after Lovecraft's death.\n\nIn \"The Dreams in the Witch House\" (1932), the protagonist Walter Gilman dreams that he is told by the witch Keziah Mason that \"He must meet the Black Man, and go with them all to the throne of Azathoth at the centre of ultimate Chaos... He must sign in his own blood the book of Azathoth and take a new secret name... What kept him from going with her...to the throne of Chaos where the thin flutes pipe mindlessly was the fact that he had seen the name 'Azathoth' in the \"Necronomicon\", and knew it stood for a primal horror too horrible for description.\" Gilman wakes from another dream remembering \"the thin, monotonous piping of an unseen flute\", and decides that \"he had picked up that last conception from what he had read in the \"Necronomicon\" about the mindless entity Azathoth, which rules all time and space from a curiously environed black throne at the centre of Chaos\". He later fears finding himself \"in the spiral black vortices of that ultimate void of Chaos wherein reigns the mindless daemon-sultan Azathoth\".\n\nThe poet Edward Pickman Derby, the protagonist of Lovecraft's \"The Thing on the Doorstep\", is a poet whose collection of \"nightmare lyrics\" is called \"Azathoth and Other Horrors\".\n\nThe last major reference in Lovecraft's fiction to Azathoth was in 1935's \"The Haunter of the Dark\", which tells of \"the ancient legends of Ultimate Chaos, at whose center sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things, encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers, and lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a demonic flute held in nameless paws\".\n\nIn a letter to a friend who jokingly claimed descent from Jupiter, Lovecraft drew up a detailed genealogy charting his and fellow novelist Clark Ashton Smith's shared descent from Azathoth, through Lovecraft's creation Nyarlathotep and Clark-Smith's Tsathoggua, respectively. As nowhere stated in Lovecraft's published work, primordial Azathoth here is made ancestor, through his children Nyarlathotep, \"The Nameless Mist,\" and \"Darkness,\" of Yog-Sothoth, Shub-Niggurath, Nug and Yeb, Cthulhu, Tsathoggua, several deities and monsters unmentioned outside the letter, and a few of Lovecraft's and Ashton-Smith's fancifully-posited human forbears.\n\nMany other Mythos writers have referred to Azathoth in their stories. August Derleth, in his novel \"The Lurker at the Threshold\", depicts the entity as a leader in a cosmic upheaval akin to Lucifer's rebellion in Christian mythology. In a passage attributed to the \"Necronomicon\" of Abdul Alhazred, Derleth writes:\n\nIn another passage, Derleth quotes a prophecy:\n\nThe Elder Gods punished Azathoth by rendering him mindless and blind, according to Derleth.\n\nIn \"The Insects from Shaggai\", Ramsey Campbell describes the extraterrestrial creatures of the title as worshippers of \"the hideous god Azathoth\", practicing \"obscene rites\" that involved \"atrocities practiced on still-living victims\" in Azathoth's conical temple. After fleeing from the destruction of their home planet of Shaggai, the insects teleported the temple across the universe, eventually ending up in a forest near Campbell's fictional town of Goatswood.\n\nRonald Shea, the narrator of Campbell's story, enters the temple after visiting the forest and discovers a twenty-foot idol that \"represented the god Azathoth—Azathoth as he had been before his exile Outside\":\n\nAt the story's climax, Shea catches a glimpse of \"what the idiot god might \"now\" resemble\":\n\nIn \"The Mine on Yuggoth\", Edward Taylor had found Azathoth's other name, N______ (not given in full) in the Revelations of Glaaki. If one is confronted by a mythos being, the name, if spoken, will scare it away. Edward Taylor fails to use it.\n\nGary Myers makes frequent mention of Azathoth in his stories, both those set in the Lovecraftian Dreamlands and those set in the waking world. In \"The Snout in the Alcove\" (1977), the dreamer protagonist is distressed to find himself in the Dreamlands to which he had vowed never to return. He had made his vow because of a prophecy which said that:\n\nIn \"The Last Night of Earth\" (1995), the Dreamlands sorcerer Han briefly ponders:\n\nIn \"The Web\" (2003), the two teen protagonists read this passage from an internet version of the \"Necronomicon\":\n\nThomas Ligotti's short story \"The Sect of the Idiot\" (1988) mentions a circle of non-human worshippers composed of wizened, hideous creatures. The story's epigram—a \"quotation\" from the \"Necronomicon\"—reads \"The primal chaos, Lord of all... the blind idiot god—Azathoth,\" suggesting that it is that entity whom the creatures worship.\n\nLigotti has stated that many of his short stories make allusions to Lovecraft's Azathoth, although rarely by that name. An example of this is the story \"Nethescurial\", which portrays an omnipresent, malevolent, creator deity once worshipped by the inhabitants of a small island. This being slowly infiltrates the life of the story's narrator, first via a manuscript describing its cult.\n\nNick Mamatas's 2004 novel \"Move Under Ground\", set in a world where Cthulhu has taken power and only the Beats oppose him, the power of the Great Old Ones twists the constellations into new shapes, using them as vessels for his surrogates; among them, Jack Kerouac observes the \"red stars of Azathoth\". Neal Cassady later becomes a chosen one of Azathoth, gaining immense powers to be used against Cthulhu in the process.\n\nIn the \"Call of Cthulhu\" RPG, Azathoth is categorized as an Outer God together with Nyarlathotep, Yog-Sothoth, and others.\n\nIn 1995, Chaosium published \"The Azathoth Cycle\", a Cthulhu Mythos anthology focusing on works referring to or inspired by the entity Azathoth. Edited by Lovecraft scholar Robert M. Price, the book includes an introduction by Price tracing the roots and development of the Blind Idiot God. The contents include:\n\n\n\n"}

Standardised guidelines may be required to better match clinical practice with current literature.\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF), also known as mucoviscidosis, is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs, but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestines. Major advances over the past few years in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) have resulted in dramatic improvements in longevity and quality of life for many patients. However, respiratory dysfunction remains responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality associated with the disorder. Physiotherapy has long played an important role in the respiratory management of the disease, and has had to adapt to the changes in disease pattern from infancy to adulthood. The role of the physiotherapist is not limited to airway clearance, but also includes encouragement and advice regarding exercise, posture and mobility, inhalation therapy and, in the later stages of the disease process, non-invasive respiratory support. It is generally felt that the use of chest physiotherapy in CF has lacked good scientific basis, and the current call for evidence-based medicine requires physiotherapists to scrutinize their practice closely.\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also known as chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD), and chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), among others, is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by chronically poor airflow. It typically worsens over time. The main symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and excess sputum production. As COPD gets worse, subject may be short of breath even when one does simple things like get dressed or fix a meal. It gets harder to eat or exercise, and breathing takes much more energy. People often lose weight and get weaker.\n\nDeep vein thrombosis, or deep venous thrombosis (DVT), is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism.\n\nThe \"active cycle of breathing techniques\" (ACBT) is a flexible regimen comprising breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises and the FET, frequently combined with gravity-assisted positioning. Increasing lung volumes during thoracic expansion allows air to get behind distal secretions via collateral ventilatory channels. During a forced expiratory manoeuvre, compression and narrowing occurs within the airways at a point dependent on lung volume (the equal pressure point). This is shifted distally as a forced expiration is continued to low lung volume, thereby mobilizing peripheral secretions.\n\nThis technique has been reported to be an effective and efficient means of airway clearance with documented improvements in lung function and no detrimental effect on oxygen saturation. In comparative studies the ACBT has been found to be advantageous when compared with CCPT, Flutter, and PEP. When compared with the technique of autogenic drainage (AD) Miller et al., reported no differences in efficacy, although ACBT was associated with oxygen desaturation in some cases. There was, however, no significant overall difference in saturation between the two techniques. A more recent comparison of the Flutter and forced expiration with the ACBT reported no significant differences between the treatments for sputum weight, lung function tests or oxygen saturation.\n\nPulmonary rehabilitation is an evidence-based intervention for the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In clinical practice, the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is commonly used to assess changes in functional exercise capacity in COPD patients following pulmonary rehabilitation with the primary outcome reported being the distance walked during the test (i.e. 6MWD). The 6MWD has demonstrated validity and reliability after one familiarisation test and the capacity to detect changes following pulmonary rehabilitation. In addition to assessing the outcomes of pulmonary rehabilitation, 6MWD may be used to quantify the magnitude of a patient's disability, prescribe a walking programme, identify patients likely to benefit from a rollator and to identify the presence of exercise-induced hypoxemia.\n\nRandomized trials have demonstrated that pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) can improve dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and health-related quality of life. Rehabilitation has traditionally been provided in secondary care to patients with moderate to severe disease. However, current concepts are recommending that it should be delivered in a primary and community care setting for patients with milder disease.\n\nThere are several opportunities for spreading the word for PR in primary care. One of these is to improve access to PR for all those disabled by their disease by the increase of community schemes. One such scheme being utilised in Canada is reviewed. The essential components of PR include behavior change, patient self-management and prescriptive exercise. In the last decade new strategies have been developed to enhance the effects of exercise training. An overview of these new approaches being an adjunct to exercise training is reviewed. Although the role of exercise training is well established, we are only just beginning to appreciate the importance of behavior change and patient self-management in contributing to improved health and diminished healthcare resource utilisation.\n"}

They were killed and eaten, along with many other animals from the zoo, in late 1870 during the Siege of Paris. The two elephants may have been siblings, and were named after the twin brothers of Greek and Roman mythology. They had been popular before the siege for giving rides on their backs around the park, but the food shortages caused by the German blockade of the city eventually drove the citizens of Paris to kill them for their meat.\n\nOn 19 September 1870, Prussian forces encircled Paris. Rather than bombarding the city into surrender the German high command decided to blockade the city to force a quick surrender. The Parisians managed to hold out until 28 January 1871 (when they surrendered after three days of shelling ordered by Otto von Bismarck who had tired of the ineffective tactics of the high command). During the siege food became scarce and the populace were forced to turn to unusual sources for their meat.\nWhen vegetables, butter, milk, cheese and the regularly consumed meats began to run out, the Parisians turned first on the horses, donkeys and mules. Horse meat had been introduced by the butchers of Paris four years earlier as a cheap alternative source of meat for the poor, but under siege conditions it quickly became a luxury item. Though there were large numbers of horses in Paris (estimates suggested between 65,000 and 70,000 were butchered and eaten during the siege) the supplies were ultimately limited. Champion racehorses were not spared (even two horses presented to Napoleon III by Alexander II of Russia were slaughtered) but the meat soon became scarce. Cats, dogs, mice and rats were the next selection for the menu. There was no control over rationing until late in the siege, so while the poor struggled, the wealthy Parisians ate comparatively well; the Jockey Club offered a fine selection of gourmet dishes of the unusual meats including \"Salmis de rats à la Robert\". There were considerably fewer cats and dogs in the city than there had been horses, and the unpalatable mice and rats were difficult to prepare, so, by the end of 1870, the butchers turned their attention to the animals of the zoos. The medium and large sized herbivores, such as the antelope, camels, deer, kangaroo, yaks and zebra were first to be killed. Some animals survived: the monkeys were thought to be too akin to humans to be killed, the lions and tigers were too dangerous, and the hippopotamus of the Jardin des Plantes also escaped because the price of 80,000 francs demanded for it was beyond the reach of any of the butchers. Menus began to offer exotic dishes such as \"Tête d'Ane Farcie\" (Stuffed Donkey's Head), \"Côtes d'Ours\" (Bear Ribs), \"Chat flanqué des Rats\" (Cat with Rats), \"Cuissot de Loup, Sauce Chevreuil\" (Haunch of Wolf with a Deer Sauce), \"Terrine d'Antilope aux truffes\" (Terrine of Antelope with truffles), \"Civet de Kangourou\" (Kangaroo Stew) and \"Chameau rôti à l'anglaise\" (Camel roasted \"à l'anglaise\")\n\nThe demise of the elephants was recorded in the \"Lettre-Journal de Paris\" (commonly known as the \"Gazette des Absents\"), a twice-weekly periodical published during the siege by Damase Jouaust and delivered, along with the mail, by balloon to avoid the encircling Prussian forces. The \"Gazette des Absents\" reported that Castor had been killed on 29 December 1870 and Pollux the following day, both by explosive steel-tipped bullets fired from a range of 10 m by M. Devisme. However, a menu from 25 December was already offering \"Consommé d'Eléphant\" so it is likely that the dates are wrong. The elephants were bought by M. Deboos of the Boucherie Anglaise in Boulevard Hausmann for 27,000 francs for the pair. M.Deboos did well out of the purchase: the trunks sold as a delicacy for 40 or 45 francs a pound, the other parts for about 10 to 14 francs a pound. By all accounts, elephant was not tasty. Thomas Gibson Bowles, who was in Paris during the siege, wrote that he had eaten camel, antelope, dog, donkey, mule and elephant and of those he liked elephant the least.

She was the center of a great social scandal when she married a non-noble against her family’s consent. Her case caused a debate about the law for marriage between nobles and non-nobles.\n\nShe was the daughter of statesman and marshal Count Gabriel Gabrielsson Oxenstierna (d. 1673) and Countess Maria Christiana von Löwenstein und Scharfeneck (d. 1672; in turn she was the only surviving daughter of Countess Elisabeth Juliana of Erbach –later wife of the Swedish Field Marshal Johan Banér– in her first marriage) and sister of Count Gustaf Adolf Oxenstierna. As an orphan, she was taken care of by her paternal aunt, Countess Anna af Dohna.\n\nThe vicar (since 1687) of the French Lutheran church in Stockholm, Nikolaus Bergius, was lodged in the palace of Dohna. Bergius suffered from severe depression and Dohna asked her niece to comfort him. Oxenstierna and Bergius fell in love and Bergius proposed, but Oxenstierna declined, as she knew she would be an outcast from her family and the nobility if she consented. Her family found out and banned every plans of a marriage. Bergius was separated from her in 1688–89. Their relationship was eventually taken up again. After a priest had agreed to conduct the ceremony, Oxenstierna and Bergius were married in 1691. The marriage was kept a secret, and she remained with her unknowing family. In 1692, she became pregnant; she moved to her spouse, and everything was made public.\n\nIt became a great scandal. Her family contested the legality of the marriage, and her brother, the count, reported them to Hovrätten, to the Swedish House of Lords and presented the monarch with an appeal to bring the couple to court for committing a criminal act by breaking: \n\"common law, guardian law, noble privileges, the law of the church as well as Your Majesty’s law of illegal marriages\", by: \"having dared to harm the rank of nobility by such a illegal act, in the Kingdom as well as abroad, and damaging its privileges, of such a degree that, if it is not made an example of, would unavoidably have the scandalous effect to break the public order, that a noblewoman, regardless of what kind, should be liberated.\"\n\nChristiana Oxenstierna replied to her brother: \n\"If You wish Your hatred and persecution to last as long as our lives, so it will; You will with no doubt be spared the burden soon enough and harm Yourself as much as others; I will not loose a thing thereby. If You will be as a Christian, it will be as dear to me as the wish that you will give your children treasures which rust and moths can not alter, and that we will one day meet were a Count and a master Bergius will weigh as much.\"\nThe court of the Swedish House of Lords made the verdict that a serious crime had been committed, but as the King had commented that the matter was but a private affair, the case was not pursued further.\n\nShe broke off her contact with her family and the nobility and spent the rest of her life with her spouse, spending her time as a teacher for poor children. In 1701, she died in childbirth, giving her spouse all her assets in her will, because their four children (three sons and a daughter) all died in infancy. Her family demanded she be buried discreetly, and denied her a place in her father's crypt, but as she was the only person to have repaired and taken care of the crypt, her right to be buried there could not be denied. At her funeral, \"Two Countesses Oxenstierna and one Miss Banér as well as other noblewomen prepared her corpse and lifter her with their own hands in to the coffin\".\n\nIn 1704, as a reply to the debate and slander which were still very much alive about her controversial person, her former spouse published her biography: \"Kort Beskrifning af then Högwälborna Frus, Fru Christina Juliana Oxenstiernas Lefwernes Lopp\" (A description of the life of the honorable lady, lady Christina Juliana Oxenstierna) (1704).

Tina had been on her honeymoon with her new husband, fellow American Gabe Watson, who was initially charged by Queensland authorities with his wife's murder. Watson pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.\n\nEvidence presented at the trial included Watson's differing accounts of what had happened on that day, of the couple's diving experience (or lack thereof), and of Tina's life insurance. While Watson was serving his term in Australia, authorities in Alabama flagged an intention to charge him with murder at a later date. After his release, he was deported to Alabama on the condition that he would not be sentenced to death if found guilty of murder. Watson was then put on trial, but on 23 February 2012, Judge Tommy Nail dismissed the murder case due to lack of evidence.\n\nChristina Mae \"Tina\" Watson (nee Thomas) was born in West Germany on 13 February 1977, before relocating to the U.S. while still a baby. On 24 January 1980, she was legally adopted by Tommy and Cindy Thomas. They lived in Walker County, Alabama, with her younger sister before moving to Louisiana then Birmingham. David Gabriel \"Gabe\" Watson met Tina while they were students at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and they began dating in January 2001.\n\nDespite an earlier diagnosis of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), Tina took beginning diving lessons in January 2003, and earned her certification just before her wedding to Gabe on 11 October 2003. Watson was a purportedly qualified certified rescue diver, with experience in the lake at Oak Mountain State Park. Watson had completed 55 dives by the time of their marriage, and Tina 5. The couple had planned a scuba trip in the Great Barrier Reef for their honeymoon, and flew to Sydney for a week before heading to Townsville. They chose to dive the popular yet difficult wreck of SS \"Yongala\", a passenger ship that sank in 1911, even though Watson had limited open ocean experience and Tina had never dived in the ocean or below 9 metres. The dive company had also offered an orientation and guided dive with a dive master, which the couple had refused.\n\nAt around 10:30 am on 22 October, during an excursion from the dive boat \"Spoilsport\" to the site of \"Yongala\", Tina lost consciousness and sank to the bottom, below the water's surface within two minutes of beginning the dive. Watson claimed the currents were stronger than they expected and that he responded to a signal from Tina to return to the dive rope, where he noted a look of worry on her face before she accidentally knocked his mask and air regulator loose. When Watson recovered his sight, Tina was sinking too quickly for him to retrieve her and he quickly surfaced to get help. He also stated that an ear problem prevented him from diving deeper to help her and that there was nothing in his training as a rescue diver \"about how to get somebody\" in trouble to the surface.\n\nOther divers nearby at the time, including Dr. Stanley Stutz, saw Watson engaged in an underwater \"bear hug\" with his \"flailing\" wife, after which he headed for the surface while Tina fell to the ocean floor. One diver, Gary Stempler, photographed Tina by chance while taking a picture of his own wife that showed Tina in the background. The photo showed her lying face-up on the ocean floor, something that did not come to light until a couple of weeks later when the pictures were developed. Watson climbed aboard the \"Spoilsport\" and alerted dive instructor Wade Singleton, who brought Tina to the surface after ten minutes underwater. She was taken aboard the adjacent dive boat \"Jazz II\", where a doctor tried to resuscitate her for 40 minutes while Watson remained on the \"Spoilsport\".\n\nThe day following the death, Tina's autopsy was performed by Professor David Williams, consultant forensic pathologist to the Queensland Coroner. Williams found florid evidence of air embolism, but no degenerative disease. He gave the cause of death as drowning. Due to the unexpected nature of Tina's death and the implausible and conflicting statements given by Watson, the death was investigated by the State Coroner's office. A coronial inquiry was held, as is the usual practice in Australia. Watson declined to return to Australia, so did not testify during the inquest but gave evidence through his lawyers to the inquest and to the Queensland Police. During the inquest, prosecutors submitted evidence that Watson's story contradicted the record of his actions stored by his dive computer. They suggested the possibility that he turned off Tina's regulator and held her until she was unconscious, then turned the air back on and let her sink before surfacing himself. As evidence, they described the many painstaking re-enactments of various scenarios conducted by police divers. Tina's father claimed that Watson had asked Tina, shortly before their wedding, to increase her life insurance and make him the sole beneficiary.\n\nIn March 2005, Watson launched legal action in Alabama's Jefferson County Circuit Court to recoup the cost of the couple's trip after the travel insurance company refused a payout. He was seeking $45,000 for the accidental death plus compensation for trip interruption, medical expenses, phone calls, taxi fares, fees for extra credit card statements and unspecified punitive damages for mental and emotional anguish. The action was dismissed in May 2008 at Watson's request on the grounds the Australian investigation into his wife's death caused him \"to reasonably apprehend that he risks self-incrimination in this case\". His Australian legal team believed \"it was not in his best interest\" to pursue the damages claim and his U.S.-based lawyer, Bob Austin, added that his client would not be voluntarily \"going back to Australia.\"\n\nOn 19 June 2008, the Coroner laid the following charge:That on the 22nd day of October 2003 at the site of the historical shipwreck \"Yongala\" forty-eight nautical miles south east from the port of Townsville in the state of Queensland, David Gabriel Watson murdered Christina Mae Watson.\n\nIt was reported that the Coroner found \"[it was likely ] that Watson [had] killed his 26-year-old wife by turning off her air supply and holding her in an 'underwater bear hug' until she was dead\"; however, the coroner had made no such finding.\n\nAfter resisting extradition for six months, Watson travelled voluntarily from the U.S. to Australia in May 2009 to face trial. At the trial on 5 June 2009, he pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to, and was convicted of, manslaughter. Crown prosecutor Brendan Campbell pointed out that over time Watson had given police sixteen different versions of what had happened to Tina and that none of those versions matched what the only eyewitness had seen. When Tina was brought to the surface, her regulator was still in her mouth, her tank still had air, and tests indicated no faults with her equipment. Campbell described Watson as an experienced diver trained in rescuing panicked divers, who had allowed his wife to sink to the ocean floor without making any serious attempt to retrieve her. Watson did not inflate Tina's buoyancy control device (BCD) or remove her weight belt, and had failed to fulfill his obligations as her \"dive buddy\" by not sharing his alternative air source. Watson was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, to be suspended after serving only twelve months.\n\nTina's family stated that Watson's twelve-month term was an embarrassment to Australia. The day following the trial, Alabama Attorney General Troy King lodged an appeal with the Queensland Supreme Court and also wrote to Queensland Attorney-General Cameron Dick. Fairfax Media reported that the letter was leaked to them and published part of it in their newspapers.\n\nThe Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions, Tony Moynihan SC, issued a statement, which said:\n\"The decision to accept Mr Watson's plea of guilty to manslaughter was made after a careful and thorough examination of the admissible evidence, and was not taken lightly. Given the complex circumstantial nature of the case, Mr Watson's admission that he breached his duty to render assistance to his wife ultimately meant there was no reasonable prospect of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he was guilty of murder.\" On 18 June 2009, Dick announced the state would appeal against the inadequacy of Watson's sentence.\n\nThe appeal was heard by the Queensland Court of Appeals on 17 July 2009. The Crown asked the court to increase Watson's prison term to two and a half years. The defence argued that Watson had had a momentary lapse in judgment, had been accused of a crime he did not commit, and had voluntarily returned to Australia to co-operate with the court, and that the penalty imposed by the trial judge was fair and just. The findings on appeal were handed down on 18 September 2009. Two members allowed the prosecution's appeal, increasing Watson's period of incarceration by six months to a total of eighteen. One justice by minority opinion was in favour of dismissing the appeal.\n\nTina was buried in her native Pelham, Alabama. Her remains were exhumed in 2007 and moved to a different lot bought by Watson. After being informed by her family that flowers and gifts were repeatedly being vandalized or disappearing from the grave site, even when chained down, police surveillance videos showed Watson removing them with bolt cutters and throwing them in trash cans. Watson later said he removed them because they were \"big, gaudy, plastic arrangements\". Her grave was unmarked until 2009, when Watson provided a foot marker, prompting her father to request her body be returned for reburial. In 2011, the Probate Court removed Watson as administrator of Tina's estate and appointed her father, who also wants her school and college pictures and yearbooks returned. Watson has appealed against the ruling and refused to provide the court with an inventory of Tina's possessions. Pending Watson's trial, the Alabama Circuit Court ordered him to stay away from the grave.\n\nIn May 2010, King announced he had information not yet made public and wanted to try Watson for capital murder, asserting jurisdiction based on the theory that the alleged crime was planned in Alabama. King petitioned Australia for the evidence held by police, but was refused access until he gave an undertaking that the death penalty would not be imposed, as required under Australian law. This condition has been strongly criticised by King and Don Valeska, chief of the Attorney General's violent crime division, who stated: \"If an Australian woman was killed here, we would immediately send the evidence there. We would not presume to tell the Australian authorities how to run their criminal justice system\". In response to the announcement, Watson's parents came to the defence of their son, breaking their public silence on the case. Friends and family of Watson questioned whether he had any motive for the murder, noting that his affection for Tina had seemed genuine, there was no life insurance policy naming him as beneficiary, and he appeared to be emotionally devastated for an extended time following her death.\n\nIn June 2010, King assured the Queensland Attorney-General he would not seek the death penalty if Watson was tried in the U.S. for his wife's death. In August 2010 it was announced Watson would be released in November and was likely to be deported to the US, where he faced being charged with murder. Valeska stated he would pursue an additional charge of kidnapping by deception. The case was placed before a grand jury in Birmingham, Alabama, in October 2010.\n\nWatson was released from prison on 10 November 2010. He was transferred to an immigration detention centre while his deportation was delayed. During this time, Australian authorities sought further written assurances from the US Attorney General that he would not face the death penalty in Alabama if convicted of murder. Under international human rights law, Australia could not deport Watson if he faced execution in his home country. On 25 November 2010 he was deported to the United States and immediately arrested.\n\nAlabama prosecutors charged Gabe with murder at the conclusion of his prison sentence in Australia after finding what they claimed was evidence he had plotted to kill his wife while still in the United States. A Birmingham grand jury indicted Watson on murder charges in October 2010. In July 2011, the Circuit Court set the trial date for 13 February 2012; Watson was released on bond.\n\nColin McKenzie, a key diving expert in the original investigation who had maintained that \"a diver with Watson's training should have been able to bring Tina up\", subsequently retracted much of his testimony after being provided with Tina and Gabe's diver logs, certificates and medical histories, to which he had not previously had access. McKenzie claimed Gabe should not have been allowed in the water and never as a dive buddy for his wife, who had no open water scuba experience. Tina had heart surgery to correct an irregular heartbeat two years earlier but on her dive application had stated that she had never had heart problems or surgery. Professor Michael \"Mike\" Bennett, a leading expert in dive medicine, stated that Tina was unfit to dive without clearance from a cardiologist. Gabe had received his rescue certification, normally a four-day course, after completing a two-day course in an Alabama quarry. He had no rescue experience and little open water experience.\n\nAccording to McKenzie, \"He had no hope of being competent, he could barely save himself [that day] let alone his wife; I don't believe he intended to kill her.\" Revelations that Watson needed help to don his diving equipment that day underscored that he was a \"dangerous amateur\" who showed \"a complete lack of courage\" when he abandoned his wife. The dive company had offered an orientation and guided dive with a dive master, which both Tina and Gabe had refused. Company head Mike Ball said his people took Watson at his word, believing he was an experienced and certified rescue diver. The company later pleaded guilty to contravening safety standards (their code of conduct said both Gabe and Tina must be supervised by at least a divemaster on the dive in question) and was fined $6,500, plus costs of $1,500.\n\nAlabama judge Tommy Nail ruled that evidence of Watson's behaviour following Tina's death was inadmissible. Nail also blocked Tina's father from giving evidence regarding Watson's alleged attempts to increase Tina's life insurance. On 23 February 2012, Nail acquitted Gabe for lack of evidence without the defence needing to present its case. Nail said that the state's evidence was \"sorely lacking\" and that the prosecution could not prove that Watson had any financial motive. Prosecutor Don Valeska said that this was the first time he had had a trial end in a judge's acquittal in the 41 years he had been trying cases. Regarding the judge's decision, Thomas said, \"It should have gone to the jury for them to decide.\"\n\nA feature on the death of Tina Watson was broadcast in a 90-minute account that aired on \"Dateline NBC\" on 19 May 2008. An examination of Tina's death and Gabe's subsequent trial and appeal was published by \"The Age\" on 17 July 2010. The author was Walkley Award winning investigative journalist, Peter Patrick. A feature on the death of Watson and her husband's Alabama acquittal was broadcast on an episode of the Australian \"60 Minutes\" on 25 March 2012. Lifetime produced a made-for-TV movie, \"Fatal Honeymoon\", based on the death of Tina Watson, starring Harvey Keitel, Billy Miller and Amber Clayton. It premiered on 25 August 2012. Tina Watson's death was explored on \"Casefile True Crime Podcast\" (Case 51) which was published on 22 April 2017.\n\n\n"}

The only provision in the second will was that the son was appointed the sole heir of the insurance policies, so he did not deal with any of the rest of his estate.

It is more akin to a plant than an animal. It is a horrible, fetid growth, resembling a bright green, sticky, wet moss which grows on the walls and ceilings of caves, sewers, dungeons, mines, and the like.\n\nThe description of various \"genera\" and \"species\" of corrosive mineral oozes encountered by unwary miners underground, that can eat unnoticed through skin and flesh to the bone, date back at least to the works of Georg Agricola. Some of these might have been inspired by cavers' contacts with peculiar lifeforms in caves with a high hydrogen sulfide and sulfuric acid content which are even more corrosive than the environments they inhabit, such as the \"snottites\", \"red goo\", and \"green slime\" encountered in the real-world Cueva de Villa Luz.\n\nThe conception of green slime as an invasive life form that overgrows its victims, as depicted in \"Dungeons & Dragons\", also has roots in science fiction, such as the 1968 film \"The Green Slime\", and horror such as William Hope Hodgson's short story \"The Voice In The Night\".\n\nThe green slime first appeared in the original \"Dungeons & Dragons\" set (1974).\n\nThe green slime appeared in the \"D&D Basic Set\" (1977, 1981, 1983) and \"Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia\" (1991).\n\nThe green slime appeared in first edition \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" in the original \"Monster Manual\" (1977).\n\nThe green slime appeared in second edition \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" in \"Monstrous Compendium Volume One\" (1989), reprinted in the \"Monstrous Manual\" (1993) under the \"ooze\" entry.\n\nThe green slime appeared in the third edition \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" (2000) as a dungeon hazard, and again in the 3.5 revised \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" (2003).\n\nGreen slime appeared in the fifth edition \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" as a dungeon hazard.\n\nThe green slime is notably different from other oozes. Being a growth, it is fixed to one place and cannot move or attack. For the most part, it is forced to feed off of vegetable, organic or metallic substances in an underground wall. If it grows on a ceiling, however, it can sense if someone passes below, and drops onto them. Living creatures touched by a green slime eventually turn into green slime themselves. Green slime is vulnerable to light, heat, frost, and \"cure disease\" spells.\n\nGreen slimes are mindless and cannot speak. As such, they are regarded as neutral in alignment.\n\nA green slime will regrow if even the tiniest residue remains, and can germinate to form a full sized ooze again years later. In the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" universe, huge colonies of green slime exist deep beneath the earth.\n"}
{"id": "173072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173072", "title": "Growth hormone", "text": "Growth hormone\n\nGrowth hormone (GH), also known as somatotropin (or as human growth hormone [hGH or HGH] in its human form), is a peptide hormone that stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and cell regeneration in humans and other animals. It is thus important in human development. It is a type of mitogen which is specific only to certain kinds of cells. Growth hormone is a 191-amino acid, single-chain polypeptide that is synthesized, stored and secreted by somatotropic cells within the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland.\n\nGH is a stress hormone that stimulates production of IGF-1 and raises the concentration of glucose and free fatty acids. \n\nA recombinant form of hGH called somatropin (INN) is used as a prescription drug to treat children's growth disorders and adult growth hormone deficiency. In the United States, it is only available legally from pharmacies, by prescription from a doctor. In recent years in the United States, some doctors have started to prescribe growth hormone in GH-deficient older patients (but not on healthy people) to increase vitality. While legal, the efficacy and safety of this use for HGH has not been tested in a clinical trial. At this time, HGH is still considered a very complex hormone, and many of its functions are still unknown.\n\nIn its role as an anabolic agent, HGH has been used by competitors in sports since at least 1982, and has been banned by the IOC and NCAA. Traditional urine analysis does not detect doping with HGH, so the ban was unenforceable until the early 2000s, when blood tests that could distinguish between natural and artificial HGH were starting to be developed. Blood tests conducted by WADA at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece targeted primarily HGH. Use of the drug for performance enhancement is not currently approved by the FDA.\n\nGH has been studied for use in raising livestock more efficiently in industrial agriculture and several efforts have been made to obtain governmental approval to use GH in livestock production. These uses have been controversial. In the United States, the only FDA-approved use of GH for livestock is the use of a cow-specific form of GH called bovine somatotropin for increasing milk production in dairy cows. Retailers are permitted to label containers of milk as produced with or without bovine somatotropin.\n\nThe names \"somatotropin\" (\"STH\") or \"somatotropic hormone\" refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses. Hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated \"hGH\". The main growth hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology has the approved generic name (INN) \"somatropin\" and the brand name \"Humatrope\", and is properly abbreviated rhGH in the scientific literature. Since its introduction in 1992 Humatrope has been a banned sports doping agent, and in this context is referred to as HGH.\n\nGenes for human growth hormone, known as growth hormone 1 (somatotropin; pituitary growth hormone) and growth hormone 2 (placental growth hormone; growth hormone variant), are localized in the q22-24 region of chromosome 17 and are closely related to human chorionic somatomammotropin (also known as placental lactogen) genes. GH, human chorionic somatomammotropin, and prolactin belong to a group of homologous hormones with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity.\n\nThe major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons. The structure includes four helices necessary for functional interaction with the GH receptor. It appears that, in structure, GH is evolutionarily homologous to prolactin and chorionic somatomammotropin. Despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species, only human and Old World monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor.\n\nSeveral molecular isoforms of GH exist in the pituitary gland and are released to blood. In particular, a variant of approximately 20 kDa originated by an alternative splicing is present in a rather constant 1:9 ratio, while recently an additional variant of ~ 23-24 kDa has also been reported in post-exercise states at higher proportions. This variant has not been identified, but it has been suggested to coincide with a 22 kDa glycosylated variant of 23 kDa identified in the pituitary gland. Furthermore, these variants circulate partially bound to a protein (growth hormone-binding protein, GHBP), which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor, and an acid-labile subunit (ALS).\n\nSecretion of growth hormone (GH) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretory nuclei of the hypothalamus. \nThese cells release the peptides Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH or \"somatocrinin\") and Growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH or \"somatostatin\") into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary.\nGH release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides, which in turn is affected by many physiological stimulators (e.g., exercise, nutrition, sleep) and inhibitors (e.g., free fatty acids) of GH secretion.\n\nSomatotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland then synthesize and secrete GH in a pulsatile manner, in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus. \nThe largest and most predictable of these GH peaks occurs about an hour after onset of sleep with plasma levels of 13 to 72 ng/mL. \nOtherwise there is wide variation between days and individuals. Nearly fifty percent of GH secretion occurs during the third and fourth NREM sleep stages.\nSurges of secretion during the day occur at 3- to 5-hour intervals. The plasma concentration of GH during these peaks may range from 5 to even 45 ng/mL.\nBetween the peaks, basal GH levels are low, usually less than 5 ng/mL for most of the day and night. Additional analysis of the pulsatile profile of GH described in all cases less than 1 ng/ml for basal levels while maximum peaks were situated around 10-20 ng/mL.\n\nA number of factors are known to affect GH secretion, such as age, sex, diet, exercise, stress, and other hormones. Young adolescents secrete GH at the rate of about 700 μg/day, while healthy adults secrete GH at the rate of about 400 μg/day. Sleep deprivation generally suppresses GH release, particularly after early adulthood.\n\nStimulators of growth hormone (GH) secretion include:\n\n\"Inhibitors\" of GH secretion include:\n\nIn addition to control by endogenous and stimulus processes, a number of foreign compounds (xenobiotics such as drugs and endocrine disruptors) are known to influence GH secretion and function.\n\nEffects of growth hormone on the tissues of the body can generally be described as anabolic (building up). Like most other protein hormones, GH acts by interacting with a specific receptor on the surface of cells.\n\nIncreased height during childhood is the most widely known effect of GH. Height appears to be stimulated by at least two mechanisms:\n\n\nIn addition to increasing height in children and adolescents, growth hormone has many other effects on the body:\n\nThe most common disease of GH excess is a pituitary tumor composed of somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary. These somatotroph adenomas are benign and grow slowly, gradually producing more and more GH. For years, the principal clinical problems are those of GH excess. Eventually, the adenoma may become large enough to cause headaches, impair vision by pressure on the optic nerves, or cause deficiency of other pituitary hormones by displacement.\n\nProlonged GH excess thickens the bones of the jaw, fingers and toes, resulting heaviness of the jaw and increased size of digits, referred to as acromegaly. Accompanying problems can include sweating, pressure on nerves (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome), muscle weakness, excess sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), insulin resistance or even a rare form of type 2 diabetes, and reduced sexual function.\n\nGH-secreting tumors are typically recognized in the fifth decade of life. It is extremely rare for such a tumor to occur in childhood, but, when it does, the excessive GH can cause excessive growth, traditionally referred to as pituitary gigantism.\n\nSurgical removal is the usual treatment for GH-producing tumors. In some circumstances, focused radiation or a GH antagonist such as pegvisomant may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function. Other drugs like octreotide (somatostatin agonist) and bromocriptine (dopamine agonist) can be used to block GH secretion because both somatostatin and dopamine negatively inhibit GHRH-mediated GH release from the anterior pituitary.\n\nThe effects of growth hormone (GH) deficiency vary depending on the age at which they occur. Alterations in somatomedin can result in growth hormone deficiency with two known mechanisms; failure of tissues to respond to somatomedin, or failure of the liver to produce somatomedin. Major manifestations of GH deficiency in children are growth failure, the development of a short stature, and delayed sexual maturity. In adults, somatomedin alteration contributes to increased osteoclast activity, resulting in weaker bones that are more prone to pathologic fracture and osteoporosis. However, deficiency is rare in adults, with the most common cause being a pituitary adenoma. Other adult causes include a continuation of a childhood problem, other structural lesions or trauma, and very rarely idiopathic GHD.\n\nAdults with GHD \"tend to have a relative increase in fat mass and a relative decrease in muscle mass and, in many instances, decreased energy and quality of life\".\n\nDiagnosis of GH deficiency involves a multiple-step diagnostic process, usually culminating in GH stimulation tests to see if the patient's pituitary gland will release a pulse of GH when provoked by various stimuli.\n\nSeveral studies, primarily involving patients with GH deficiency, have suggested a crucial role of GH in both mental and emotional well-being and maintaining a high energy level. Adults with GH deficiency often have higher rates of depression than those without. While GH replacement therapy has been proposed to treat depression as a result of GH deficiency, the long-term effects of such therapy are unknown.\n\nGH has also been studied in the context of cognitive function, including learning and memory. GH in humans appears to improve cognitive function and may be useful in the treatment of patients with cognitive impairment that is a result of GH deficiency.\n\nTreatment with exogenous GH is indicated only in limited circumstances, and needs regular monitoring due to the frequency and severity of side-effects. GH is used as replacement therapy in adults with GH deficiency of either childhood-onset or adult-onset (usually as a result of an acquired pituitary tumor). In these patients, benefits have variably included reduced fat mass, increased lean mass, increased bone density, improved lipid profile, reduced cardiovascular risk factors, and improved psychosocial well-being.\n\nGH can be used to treat conditions that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in GH. However, results are not as dramatic when compared to short stature that is solely attributable to deficiency of GH. Examples of other causes of shortness often treated with GH are Turner syndrome, chronic renal failure, Prader–Willi syndrome, intrauterine growth restriction, and severe idiopathic short stature. Higher (\"pharmacologic\") doses are required to produce significant acceleration of growth in these conditions, producing blood levels well above normal (\"physiologic\"). Despite the higher doses, side-effects during treatment are rare, and vary little according to the condition being treated.\n\nOne version of rHGH has also been FDA approved for maintaining muscle mass in wasting due to AIDS.\n\nOff-label prescription of HGH is controversial and may be illegal.\n\nClaims for GH as an anti-aging treatment date back to 1990 when the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" published a study wherein GH was used to treat 12 men over 60. At the conclusion of the study, all the men showed statistically significant increases in lean body mass and bone mineral density, while the control group did not. The authors of the study noted that these improvements were the opposite of the changes that would normally occur over a 10- to 20-year aging period. Despite the fact the authors at no time claimed that GH had reversed the aging process itself, their results were misinterpreted as indicating that GH is an effective anti-aging agent. This has led to organizations such as the controversial American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine promoting the use of this hormone as an \"anti-aging agent\".\n\nA Stanford University School of Medicine meta-analysis of clinical studies on the subject published in early 2007 showed that the application of GH on healthy elderly patients increased muscle by about 2 kg and decreased body fat by the same amount. However, these were the only positive effects from taking GH. No other critical factors were affected, such as bone density, cholesterol levels, lipid measurements, maximal oxygen consumption, or any other factor that would indicate increased fitness. Researchers also did not discover any gain in muscle strength, which led them to believe that GH merely let the body store more water in the muscles rather than increase muscle growth. This would explain the increase in lean body mass.\n\nGH has also been used experimentally to treat multiple sclerosis, to enhance weight loss in obesity, as well as in fibromyalgia, heart failure, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and burns. GH has also been used experimentally in patients with short bowel syndrome to lessen the requirement for intravenous total parenteral nutrition.\n\nIn 1990, the US Congress passed an omnibus crime bill, the Crime Control Act of 1990, that amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that classified anabolic steroids as controlled substances and added a new section that stated that a person who \"knowingly distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute, human growth hormone for any use in humans other than the treatment of a disease or other recognized medical condition, where such use has been authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services\" has committed a felony.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration of the US Department of Justice considers off-label prescribing of HGH to be illegal, and to be a key path for illicit distribution of HGH. This section has also been interpreted by some doctors, most notably the authors of a commentary article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2005, as meaning that \"prescribing\" HGH off-label may be considered illegal. And some articles in the popular press, such as those criticizing the pharmaceutical industry for marketing drugs for off-label use (which is clearly illegal) have made strong statements about whether doctors can prescribe HGH off-label: \"Unlike other prescription drugs, HGH may be prescribed only for specific uses. U.S. sales are limited by law to treat a rare growth defect in children and a handful of uncommon conditions like short bowel syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome, a congenital disease that causes reduced muscle tone and a lack of hormones in sex glands.\" At the same time, anti-aging clinics where doctors prescribe, administer, and sell HGH to people are big business. In a 2012 article in \"Vanity Fair\", when asked how HGH prescriptions far exceed the number of adult patients estimated to have HGH-deficiency, Dragos Roman, who leads a team at the FDA that reviews drugs in endocrinology, said \"The F.D.A. doesn't regulate off-label uses of H.G.H. Sometimes it's used appropriately. Sometimes it's not.\"\n\nInjection-site reaction is common. More rarely, patients can experience joint swelling, joint pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and an increased risk of diabetes. In some cases, the patient can produce an immune response against GH. GH may also be a risk factor for Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\nOne survey of adults that had been treated with replacement cadaver GH (which has not been used anywhere in the world since 1985) during childhood showed a mildly increased incidence of colon cancer and prostate cancer, but linkage with the GH treatment was not established.\n\nThe first description of the use of GH as a doping agent was Dan Duchaine's \"Underground Steroid handbook\" which emerged from California in 1982; it is not known where and when GH was first used this way.\n\nAthletes in many sports have used human growth hormone in order to attempt to enhance their athletic performance. Some recent studies have not been able to support claims that human growth hormone can improve the athletic performance of professional male athletes. Many athletic societies ban the use of GH and will issue sanctions against athletes who are caught using it. However, because GH is a potent endogenous protein, it is very difficult to detect GH doping. In the United States, GH is legally available only by prescription from a medical doctor.\n\nTo capitalize on the idea that GH might be useful to combat aging, companies selling dietary supplements have websites selling products linked to GH in the advertising text, with medical-sounding names described as \"HGH Releasers\". Typical ingredients include amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and/or herbal extracts, the combination of which are described as causing the body to make more GH with corresponding beneficial effects. In the United States, because these products are marketed as dietary supplements it is illegal for them to contain GH, which is a drug. Also, under United States law, products sold as dietary supplements cannot have claims that the supplement treats or prevents any disease or condition, and the advertising material must contain a statement that the health claims are not approved by the FDA. The FTC and the FDA do enforce the law when they become aware of violations.\n\nIn the United States, it is legal to give a bovine GH to dairy cows to increase milk production, and is legal to use GH in raising cows for beef; see article on Bovine somatotropin, cattle feeding, dairy farming and the beef hormone controversy.\n\nThe use of GH in poultry farming is illegal in the United States. Similarly, no chicken meat for sale in Australia is administered hormones.\n\nSeveral companies have attempted to have a version of GH for use in pigs (porcine somatotropin) approved by the FDA but all applications have been withdrawn.\n\nThe identification, purification and later synthesis of growth hormone is associated with Choh Hao Li. Genentech pioneered the first use of recombinant human growth hormone for human therapy in 1981.\n\nPrior to its production by recombinant DNA technology, growth hormone used to treat deficiencies was extracted from the pituitary glands of cadavers. Attempts to create a wholly synthetic HGH failed. Limited supplies of HGH resulted in the restriction of HGH therapy to the treatment of idiopathic short stature. Very limited clinical studies of growth hormone derived from an Old World monkey, the rhesus macaque, were conducted by John C. Beck and colleagues in Montreal, in the late 1950s. The study published in 1957, which was conducted on \"a 13-year-old male with well-documented hypopituitarism secondary to a crainiophyaryngioma,\" found that: \"Human and monkey growth hormone resulted in a significant enhancement of nitrogen storage ... (and) there was a retention of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and sodium. ... There was a gain in body weight during both periods. ... There was a significant increase in urinary excretion of aldosterone during both periods of administration of growth hormone. This was most marked with the human growth hormone. ... Impairment of the glucose tolerance curve was evident after 10 days of administration of the human growth hormone. No change in glucose tolerance was demonstrable on the fifth day of administration of monkey growth hormone.\" The other study, published in 1958, was conducted on six people: the same subject as the Science paper; an 18-year-old male with statural and sexual retardation and a skeletal age of between 13 and 14 years; a 15-year-old female with well-documented hypopituitarism secondary to a craniopharyngioma; a 53-year-old female with carcinoma of the breast and widespread skeletal metastases; a 68-year-old female with advanced postmenopausal osteoporosis; and a healthy 24-year-old medical student without any clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic disease.\n\nIn 1985, unusual cases of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease were found in individuals that had received cadaver-derived HGH ten to fifteen years previously. Based on the assumption that infectious prions causing the disease were transferred along with the cadaver-derived HGH, cadaver-derived HGH was removed from the market.\n\nIn 1985, biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nAs of 2005, recombinant growth hormones available in the United States (and their manufacturers) included Nutropin (Genentech), Humatrope (Lilly), Genotropin (Pfizer), Norditropin (Novo), and Saizen (Merck Serono). In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a version of rHGH called Omnitrope (Sandoz). A sustained-release form of growth hormone, Nutropin Depot (Genentech and Alkermes) was approved by the FDA in 1999, allowing for fewer injections (every 2 or 4 weeks instead of daily); however, the product was discontinued by Genentech/Alkermes in 2004 for financial reasons (Nutropin Depot required significantly more resources to produce than the rest of the Nutropin line).\n\n"}
{"id": "788698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=788698", "title": "Hachikō", "text": "Hachikō\n\nHachikō was born on November 10, 1923 at a farm near the city of Ōdate, Akita Prefecture. In 1924, Hidesaburō Ueno, a professor at the Tokyo Imperial University, brought him to live in Shibuya, Tokyo as his pet. Hachikō would meet Ueno at Shibuya Station every day after his commute home. This continued until May 21, 1925, when Ueno died of a cerebral hemorrhage while at work. From then until his death in March 8, 1935, Hachikō would return to Shibuya Station every day to await Ueno's return. \n\nDuring his lifetime, the dog was held up in Japanese culture as an example of loyalty and fidelity. Well after his death, he continues to be remembered in worldwide popular culture, with statues, movies, books, and appearances in various media. Hachikō is known in Japanese as chūken Hachikō (忠犬ハチ公) \"faithful dog Hachikō\", \"hachi\" meaning \"eight\" and the suffix \"-kō\" indicating affection.\n\nHachiko, a golden brown Akita, was born on November 10, 1923 at a farm located in Ōdate, Akita Prefecture, Japan. In 1924, Hidesaburō Ueno, a professor in the agriculture department at the Tokyo Imperial University, took Hachikō as a pet and brought him to live in Shibuya, Tokyo. Ueno would commute daily to work, and Hachikō would leave the house to greet him at the end of each day at the nearby Shibuya Station. The pair continued the daily routine until May 21, 1925, when Ueno did not return. The professor had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, while he was giving a lecture, and died without ever returning to the train station in which Hachikō waited.\n\nEach day, for the next nine years, nine months and fifteen days, Hachikō awaited Ueno's return, appearing precisely when the train was due at the station.\n\nHachikō attracted the attention of other commuters. Many of the people who frequented the Shibuya train station had seen Hachikō and Professor Ueno together each day. Initial reactions from the people, especially from those working at the station, were not necessarily friendly. However, after the first appearance of the article about him in \"Asahi Shimbun\" on October 4, 1932, people started to bring Hachikō treats and food to nourish him during his wait.\n\nOne of Ueno's students, Hirokichi Saito, who developed expertise on the Akita breed, saw the dog at the station and followed him to the Kobayashi home, the home of Ueno's former gardener, Kuzaboro Kobayashi, where he learned the history of Hachikō's life. Shortly after the meeting, the former student published a documented census of Akitas in Japan. His research found only 30 purebred Akitas remaining, including Hachikō from Shibuya Station.\n\nHe returned frequently to visit Hachikō, and over the years he published several articles about the dog's remarkable loyalty. In 1932, one of his articles, published in \"Asahi Shimbun\", placed the dog in the national spotlight.\n\nHachikō became a national sensation. His faithfulness to his master's memory impressed the people of Japan as a spirit of family loyalty to which all should strive to achieve. Teachers and parents used Hachikō's vigil as an example for children to follow. A well-known Japanese artist rendered a sculpture of the dog, and throughout the country, a new awareness of the Akita breed grew.\n\nEventually, Hachikō's legendary faithfulness became a national symbol of loyalty, particularly to the person and institution of Emperors.\n\nHachikō died on March 8, 1935 at the age of 11. He was found on a street in Shibuya. In March 2011, scientists finally settled the cause of death of Hachikō: the dog had both terminal cancer and a filaria infection. There were also four yakitori skewers in Hachikō's stomach, but the skewers did not damage his stomach or cause his death.\n\nAfter his death, Hachikō's remains were cremated and his ashes were buried in Aoyama Cemetery, Minato, Tokyo where they rest beside those of Hachikō's beloved master, Professor Ueno. Hachikō's fur, which was preserved after his death, was stuffed and mounted and is currently on permanent display at the National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno, Tokyo. \n\nIn April 1934, a bronze statue based in his likeness sculpted by Teru Ando was erected at Shibuya Station (), and Hachikō himself was present at its unveiling. The statue was recycled for the war effort during World War II. In 1948, the Society for Recreating the Hachikō Statue commissioned Takeshi Ando, son of the original artist, to make a second statue. When the new statue appeared, a dedication ceremony occurred. The new statue, which was erected in August 1948, still stands and is a popular meeting spot. The station entrance near this statue is named \"Hachikō-guchi\", meaning \"The Hachikō Entrance/Exit\", and is one of Shibuya Station's five exits.\n\n\"The Japan Times\" played an April Fools' joke on readers by reporting that the bronze statue was stolen a little before 2:00 AM on April 1, 2007, by \"suspected metal thieves\". The false story told a very detailed account of an elaborate theft by men wearing khaki workers' uniforms who secured the area with orange safety cones and obscured the theft with blue vinyl tarps. The \"crime\" was allegedly recorded on security cameras.\n\nA similar statue stands in Hachikō's hometown, in front of Ōdate Station. In 2004, a new statue of Hachikō was erected in front of the Akita Dog Museum in Odate, Japan.\n\nAfter the release of the American movie \"\" (2009) filmed in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, the Japanese Consulate in the United States helped the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council and the city of Woonsocket to unveil an identical statue of Hachikō at the Woonsocket Depot Square, which was the location of the \"Bedridge\" train station featured in the movie.\n\nOn March 9, 2015, the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Tokyo unveiled a bronze statue depicting Ueno returning to meet Hachikō at the University of Tokyo, Japan to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Hachikō's death. The statue was sculpted by Tsutomo Ueda from Nagoya and depicts a very excited Hachikō jumping up to greet his master at the end of a workday. Ueno is dressed in a hat, suit, and trench coat, with his briefcase placed on the ground. Hachikō wears a studded harness as seen in his last photos.\n\nEach year on March 8, Hachikō's devotion is honored with a solemn ceremony of remembrance at Tokyo's Shibuya railroad station. Hundreds of dog lovers often turn out to honor his memory and loyalty.\n\nIn 1994, the Nippon Cultural Broadcasting in Japan was able to lift a recording of Hachikō barking from an old record that had been broken into several pieces. A huge advertising campaign ensued and on Saturday, May 28, 1994, 59 years after his death, millions of radio listeners tuned in to hear Hachikō bark.\n\nIn 2003, Shibuya ward started new minibus (officially called \"community bus\") routes in the ward, and nicknamed them \"\". Now there are four different routes.\n\nIn July 2012, rare photos from Hachikō's life were shown at the Shibuya Folk and Literary Shirane Memorial Museum in Shibuya ward as part of the \"Shin Shuzo Shiryoten\" (Exhibition of newly stored materials).\n\nIn November 2015, a previously undiscovered photograph of Hachikō was published for the first time. The image, which was captured in 1934 by a Tokyo bank employee, shows the dog relaxing in front of Shibuya Station.\n\n, more often referred as Yaeko Ueno, was an unmarried partner to Hidesaburō Ueno for about 10 years until his death in 1925. Hachikō was reported to have shown great happiness and affection towards her whenever she came to visit him. Yaeko died on 30 April 1961 at the age of 76 and was buried at a temple in Taitō, further away from Ueno's grave, despite her requests to her family members to be buried with her late partner.\n\nIn 2013, Yaeko's record which indicated that she had wanted to be buried with Ueno was found by Sho Shiozawa, the professor of the University of Tokyo. Shiozawa was also the president of the Japanese Society of Irrigation, Drainage and Rural Engineering, which manages Ueno’s grave at Aoyama Cemetery.\n\nLater on November 10, 2013, which also marked the 90th anniversary of the Birth of Hachikō, Sho Shiozawa and Keita Matsui, a curator of the Shibuya Folk and Literary Shirane Memorial Museum, felt the need that Yaeko to be buried together with Ueno and Hachikō.\n\nThe process began with willing consent from the Ueno and Sakano families and the successful negotiations with management of the Aoyama Cemetery. However, due to regulations and bureaucracy, the process took about 2 years. Shiozawa also went on as one of the organizers involved with the erection of bronze statue of Hachikō and Ueno which was unveiled on the grounds of the University of Tokyo on March 9, 2015 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Hachikō's death.\n\nOn 19 May 2016 during the ceremony at the Aoyama Cemetery with both Ueno and Sakano families in present, some of the ashes of Yaeko Sakano were buried with Ueno and Hachikō, her name and the date of her death was inscribed on the side of his tombstone, thus fulfilling the reunion of Hachikō's family.\n\n\"By putting the names of both on their grave, we can show future generations the fact that Hachikō had two keepers,\" Shiozawa said. \"To Hachikō the professor was his father, and Yaeko was his mother,\" Matsui added.\n\nHachikō was the subject of the 1987 movie (literally \"The Tale of Hachiko\"), directed by Seijirō Kōyama, which told the story of his life from his birth up until his death and imagined spiritual reunion with his master. Considered a blockbuster success, the film was the last big hit for Japanese film studio Shochiku Kinema Kenkyû-jo.\n\n\"\", released in August 2009, is an American movie starring actor Richard Gere, directed by Lasse Hallström, about Hachikō and his relationship with an American professor & his family following the same basic story, but a little different, for example Hachiko was a gift to professor Ueno, this part is entirely different in the American version. The movie was filmed in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, primarily in and around the Woonsocket Depot Square area and also featured Joan Allen and Jason Alexander. The role of Hachi was played by three Akitas - Leyla, Chico and Forrest. Mark Harden describes how he and his team trained the three dogs in the book, \"Animal Stars: Behind the Scenes with Your Favorite Animal Actors.\" After the movie was completed, Harden adopted Chico.\n\nHachikō is also the subject of a 2004 children's book entitled \"Hachikō: The True Story of a Loyal Dog\", written by Pamela S. Turner and illustrated by Yan Nascimbene. Another children's book, a short novel for readers of all ages called \"Hachiko Waits\", written by Lesléa Newman and illustrated by Machiyo Kodaira, was published by Henry Holt & Co. in 2004. \"Hachiko Waits\" was released in paperback by Square Fish (an imprint of MacMillan) in 2008. Hachikō is featured prominently in the 2008 novel \"The Story of Edgar Sawtelle\" by David Wroblewski. Hachikō plays an important part in the 1967 children's book \"Taka-chan and I: A Dog's Journey to Japan\".\n\nBased on Hachikō story, a movie in Telugu language was produced with the name 'Tommy'.\n\n\"Jurassic Bark\", episode 7 of season 4 of the animated series \"Futurama\" has an extended homage to Hachikō, with Fry discovering the fossilized remains of his dog, Seymour. After Fry was frozen, Seymour is shown to have waited for Fry to return for 12 years outside Panucci's Pizza, where Fry worked, never disobeying his master's last command to wait for him.\n\nA play was made by Spare Parts Puppet Theatre in Fremantle, Western Australia, and was dedicated to the story of Hachikō.\n\nThe 1987 film (literally \"The Tale of Hachiko\") and the 2009 film \"\" are based on the story of Hachikō.\n\nEpisode 6 of the anime \"Time Bokan 24\" referenced Hachiko's legacy.\n\nIn the Japanese manga \"One Piece\", there is a similar story with a dog named Chouchou.\n\nIn the anime \"\", there is a similar story about a Ninetales who waited 200 years for her master to return.\n\n\"Persona 5\" allows the player to explore Shibuya Station, where they can examine a spoof statue of Hachikō named 'Buchiko'.\n\nIn the anime, Oreimo 2: episode 5 Kirino Kōsaka relates Kyōsuke Kōsaka, waiting for her to come home to Hatchikō.\n\nIn the commentary in the Disney/Pixar movie Wall-E, one of the animators mentions that the cockroach waiting in place for the robot to return to earth was a homage to Hachiko.\n\nIn \"The World Ends with You\", a video game developed by Square Enix and Jupiter Corporation, the Hachikō statue is featured, its legend referenced on several occasions. The location of the statue plays an important role in the narrative.\n\nHachikō was among many dogs famous for their loyalty. Such stories are at least as old as the ancient Greek Homer's story of Argos. Similar to Hachiko's story is that of the Italian dog Fido, the Scottish dog Greyfriars Bobby, Shep from Fort Benton, Montana USA, Red Dog from Pilbara, Western Australia and numerous other dogs famous for remaining faithful after the death of their master. In Japan itself, it was not an unprecedented story.\n\nAccording to Nihongi, during the reign of Emperor Sushun-Tennō, a warrior named Yorozu of the Tottori-be (), vassal of Mononobe no Moriya no Ōmuraji and commander of hundred soldiers, was suspected of plotting a rebellion against the Soga clan, who happened to just kill the man. Yorozu fled alone to hide in the countryside, but he was pursued by Imperial Court soldiers. He escaped them with great ingenuity until he got shot in the knee by an arrow. Though he claimed being innocent, loyal to the Emperor and ready to surrender, the soldiers still came for the kill. Despite his injury, Yorozu deflected their arrows (Yadomejutsu), and proceeded on cutting down more than 30 of them with his sword. Probably exhausted by this martial prowess, Yorozu destroyed his bow, threw his sword into a river (in a similar fashion as the knight Roland le Preux) and finally stabbed himself in the throat with a dagger (this way of committing suicide was quite common in China at the time of Spring and Autumn period). The local governor of Kawachi received the order to cut Yorozu's corpse to pieces and expose it in order to make an example, but the white dog of Yorozu fled with his head in his mouth and brought it upon an ancient burial mound. Yorozu's dog then laid down close by and starved to death while mourning his master. The Imperial Court was moved by the dog's loyalty :\n\n\"\"The case of this dog is one that is rarely heard of in the world, and should be shown to after ages. Let Yorozu's kindred be made to construct a tomb and bury their remains\".\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23997153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23997153", "title": "Informatics", "text": "Informatics\n\nInformatics is a branch of information engineering. It involves the practice of information processing and the engineering of information systems, and as an academic field it is an applied form of information science. The field considers the interaction between humans and information alongside the construction of interfaces, organisations, technologies and systems. As such, the field of informatics has great breadth and encompasses many subspecialties, including disciplines of computer science, information systems, information technology and statistics. Since the advent of computers, individuals and organizations increasingly process information digitally. This has led to the study of informatics with computational, mathematical, biological, cognitive and social aspects, including study of the social impact of information technologies.\n\nIn 1956 the German computer scientist Karl Steinbuch coined the word \"Informatik\" by publishing a paper called \"Informatik: Automatische Informationsverarbeitung\" (\"Informatics: Automatic Information Processing\"). The English term \"Informatics\" is sometimes understood as meaning the same as computer science. The German word \"Informatik\" is usually translated to English as \"computer science\".\n\nThe French term \"informatique\" was coined in 1962 by Philippe Dreyfus together with various translations—informatics (English), also proposed independently and simultaneously by Walter F. Bauer and associates who co-founded \"Informatics Inc.\", and \"informatica\" (Italian, Spanish, Romanian, Portuguese, Dutch), referring to the application of computers to store and process information.\n\nThe term was coined as a combination of \"information\" and \"automatic\" to describe the science of automating information interactions.\nThe morphology—\"informat\"-ion + -\"ics\"—uses \"the accepted form for names of sciences, as conics, linguistics, optics, or matters of practice, as economics, politics, tactics\", and so, linguistically, the meaning extends easily to encompass both the science of information and the practice of information processing.\n\nThe culture of library science promotes policies and procedures for managing information that fosters the relationship between library science and the development of information science to provide benefits for health informatics development; which is traced to the 1950s with the beginning of computer uses in healthcare (Nelson & Staggers p.4). Early practitioners interested in the field soon learned that there were no formal education programs set up to educate them on the informatics science until the late 1960s and early 1970s. Professional development began to emerge, playing a significant role in the development of health informatics (Nelson &Staggers p.7)\nAccording to Imhoff et al., 2001, healthcare informatics is not only the application of computer technology to problems in healthcare but covers all aspects of generation, handling, communication, storage, retrieval, management, analysis, discovery, and synthesis of data information and knowledge in the entire scope of healthcare. Furthermore, they stated that the primary goal of health informatics can be distinguished as follows: To provide solutions for problems related to data, information, and knowledge processing. To study general principles of processing data information and knowledge in medicine and healthcare.\n\nReference\nImhoff, M., Webb. A.&Goldschmidt, A., (2001). Health Informatics. Intensive Care Med, 27: 179-186. doi:10.1007//s001340000747.\n\nNelson, R. & Staggers, N. Health Informatics: An Interprofessional Approach. St. Louis: Mosby, 2013. Print. (p.4,7)\n\nThis new term was adopted across Western Europe, and, except in English, developed a meaning roughly translated by the English ‘computer science’, or ‘computing science’. Mikhailov advocated the Russian term \"informatika\" (1966), and the English \"informatics\" (1967), as names for the \"theory of scientific information\", and argued for a broader meaning, including study of the use of information technology in various communities (for example, scientific) and of the interaction of technology and human organizational structures.\n\nUsage has since modified this definition in three ways. First, the restriction to scientific information is removed, as in business informatics or legal informatics. Second, since most information is now digitally stored, computation is now central to informatics. Third, the representation, processing and communication of information are added as objects of investigation, since they have been recognized as fundamental to any scientific account of information. Taking \"information\" as the central focus of study distinguishes \"informatics\" from \"computer science.\" Informatics includes the study of biological and social mechanisms of information processing whereas computer science focuses on the digital computation. Similarly, in the study of representation and communication, informatics is indifferent to the substrate that carries information. For example, it encompasses the study of communication using gesture, speech and language, as well as digital communications and networking.\n\nIn the English-speaking world the term \"informatics\" was first widely used in the compound medical informatics, taken to include \"the cognitive, information processing, and communication tasks of medical practice, education, and research, including information science and the technology to support these tasks\". Many such compounds are now in use; they can be viewed as different areas of \"applied informatics\".\nIndeed, \"In the U.S., however, informatics is linked with applied computing, or computing in the context of another domain.\"\n\nInformatics encompasses the study of systems that represent, process, and communicate information.\nHowever, the theory of computation in the specific discipline of theoretical computer science, which evolved from Alan Turing, studies the notion of a complex system regardless of whether or not information actually exists. Since both fields process information, there is some disagreement among scientists as to field hierarchy; for example Arizona State University attempted to adopt a broader definition of informatics to even encompass cognitive science at the launch of its School of Computing and Informatics in September 2006.\n\nA broad interpretation of \"informatics\", as \"the study of the structure, algorithms, behaviour, and interactions of natural and artificial computational systems,\" was introduced by the University of Edinburgh in 1994 when it formed the grouping that is now its School of Informatics. This meaning is now (2006) increasingly used in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, of the UK Funding Councils, includes a new, \"Computer Science and Informatics,\" unit of assessment (UoA), whose scope is described as follows:\n\nAcademic research in the informatics area can be found in a number of disciplines such as computer science, information technology, Information and Computer Science, information systems, business information management and health informatics.\n\nIn France, the first degree level qualifications in Informatics (computer science) appeared in the mid-1960s.\n\nIn English-speaking countries, the first example of a degree level qualification in Informatics occurred in 1982 when Plymouth Polytechnic (now the University of Plymouth) offered a four-year BSc(Honours) degree in Computing and Informatics – with an initial intake of only 35 students. The course still runs today making it the longest available qualification in the subject.\n\nAt the Indiana University School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering (Bloomington, Indianapolis and Southeast), informatics is defined as \"the art, science and human dimensions of information technology\" and \"the study, application, and social consequences of technology.\" It is also defined in Informatics 101, Introduction to Informatics as \"the application of information technology to the arts, sciences, and professions.\" These definitions are widely accepted in the United States, and differ from British usage in omitting the study of natural computation.\n\nTexas Woman's University places its informatics degrees in its department of Mathematics and Computer Science within the College of Arts & Sciences, though it offers interdisciplinary Health Informatics degrees. Informatics is presented in a generalist framework, as evidenced by their definition of informatics (\"Using technology and data analytics to derive meaningful information from data for data and decision driven practice in user centered systems\"), though TWU is also known for its nursing and health informatics programs.\n\nAt the University of California, Irvine Department of Informatics, informatics is defined as \"the interdisciplinary study of the design, application, use and impact of information technology. The discipline of informatics is based on the recognition that the design of this technology is not solely a technical matter, but must focus on the relationship between the technology and its use in real-world settings. That is, informatics designs solutions in context, and takes into account the social, cultural and organizational settings in which computing and information technology will be used.\"\n\nAt the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor Informatics interdisciplinary major, informatics is defined as \"the study of information and the ways information is used by and affects human beings and social systems. The major involves coursework from the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, where the Informatics major is housed, as well as the School of Information and the College of Engineering. Key to this growing field is that it applies both technological and social perspectives to the study of information. Michigan's interdisciplinary approach to teaching Informatics gives a solid grounding in contemporary computer programming, mathematics, and statistics, combined with study of the ethical and social science aspects of complex information systems. Experts in the field help design new information technology tools for specific scientific, business, and cultural needs.\" Michigan offers four curricular tracks within the informatics degree to provide students with increased expertise. These four track topics include:\n\nAt the University of Washington, Seattle Informatics Undergraduate Program, Informatics is an undergraduate program offered by the Information School. Bachelor of Science in Informatics is described as \"[a] program that focuses on computer systems from a user-centered perspective and studies the structure, behavior and interactions of natural and artificial systems that store, process and communicate information. Includes instruction in information sciences, human computer interaction, information system analysis and design, telecommunications structure and information architecture and management.\" Washington offers three degree options as well as a custom track.\n\nOne of the most significant areas of application of informatics is that of organizational informatics. Organizational informatics is fundamentally interested in the application of information, information systems and ICT within organisations of various forms including private sector, public sector and voluntary sector organisations. As such, organisational informatics can be seen to be a sub-category of social informatics and a super-category of business informatics. Organizational informatics are also present in the computer science and information technology industry. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "46245834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46245834", "title": "John Beveridge (mayor)", "text": "John Beveridge (mayor)\n\nJohn Beveridge, JP (8 August 184815 March 1916) was a New South Wales businessman, sportsman and local government politician, who served as an Alderman (1886–1891) and Mayor of Redfern (1891).\n\nBeveridge was born 8 August 1848 in the town of Windsor, Colony of New South Wales. He was the son of John Beveridge, a baker and confectioner, and Jane Greig, who as assisted migrants had emigrated from Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland, to Sydney on 16 January 1839. At the age of 19, Beveridge entered the mercantile firm of \"George Griffiths and Co.\" in 1867. On 8 August 1871 he was married to Priscilla Wright, the Anglo-Irish daughter of teacher and later principal of the Fort Street Training School John Wright (1822–1887), at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Sydney, by the Rev. Robert Lewers. Beveridge and his wife Priscilla had seven children: John Stuart (1872–1874), Percy (1875–1947), Mabel (1878–1955), Harry (1882–1943), Violet (1886–1975), Cecil (1888–1946) and Roy Stuart (1893–1916). In 1880 he was made a partner in the firm, and on the retirement of Griffiths became the owner, which specialised in \"wholesale grocery and general merchandise\" from its premises on the corner of Bridge and Young streets, Sydney.\n\nA prominent member of the flourishing business community in Sydney and Redfern, Beveridge became involved as a member of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce and as a director of the Mortgage, Guarantee and Mercantile Finance Corporation of New South Wales, the Sydney Real Estate Bank and the Australian Traders' Fire Insurance Company. Beveridge also became a member of the Redfern Branch of the Free Trade Association. A keen sportsman, Beveridge was a member of the Cricket Union (vice-president in 1889) and was instrumental in the development of the Surry United Cricket Club, being captain from 1879 (now the Surry Hills Cricket Club).\n\nBeveridge eventually stood for office as a free trader and became an alderman unopposed on Redfern Municipal Council for Belmore Ward on 20 September 1886, filling a vacancy created by the departure of Alderman Francis Augustus Wright, and was re-elected in February 1888. In September 1888 he presided over a meeting at Redfern Town Hall to support the ultimately-unsuccessful candidacy of free trader John Martin for a by-election to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Redfern; the meeting was attended by Sir Henry Parkes who also spoke in support.\n\nBeveridge strongly aligned himself with the politics of Parkes and later stood for the seat of Redfern himself as a Free Trade candidate at the 1889 colonial election, but was unsuccessful, missing out by a margin of over 100 votes, despite the overall success of the Free Trade movement at that election, with Parkes forming government. Even so, on 12 June 1890 he was appointed to the Redfern Sub-District Public School Board by the Governor Lord Carrington, on the advice of Free Trader Minister for Public Instruction, Joseph Carruthers.\n\nOn 12 February 1891 Beveridge was elected to be mayor of the council and was instrumental in making Redfern the first suburb in Sydney to have electricity and electric street lighting, which occurred when the Council voted unanimously in 1891, following the recommendations of the improvements committee, to build its own power station in Turner Street to power the suburb. Beveridge then proposed and passed through council a loan of £50,000 for the purpose. This movement by the council was later affirmed and protected by the Parliament of New South Wales when it passed the \"Borough of Redfern Electric Lighting Act 1895\".\n\nHowever, by May 1891 Beveridge had resigned as mayor and an alderman for Redfern prior to his candidacy for the 1891 election. His vacancy in Belmore Ward was subsequently filled by William Poole. Beveridge stood again as a Free Trade candidate for Redfern, reaffirming his support for the Free Trade vision for Australian Federation and noting that overall wages in New South Wales were higher compared to Victoria and taxation was lower owing to the Free Trade system in NSW, a system \"that is best for the commercial interests of the colony.\" Beveridge was however again unsuccessful at the June election which saw the Free Traders lose out to the Labor Party and the Protectionists.\n\nFollowing this defeat, Beveridge returned to business, taking up a high-ranking position in the Sydney office of the New York Life Insurance Company. On 25 November 1891, Beveridge sold his merchandise business, \"George Griffiths and Co.\" to David Cohen and Company. Beveridge nevertheless retained his keen interest in the Free Trade movement and in politics generally, including presiding over the election committee for John Neild's unsuccessful bid for the seat of Woollahra at the 1894 election (he lost to Adrian Knox, standing as an 'Independent Free Trade' candidate). George Reid's Free traders were successful at that election and Beveridge, in a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald, noted: \"the vote of last Tuesday must inspire every thinking man in the community with the idea that the people are ripe for the establishment of a progressive policy, and I believe Mr Reid is the man for the hour.\"\n\nBy 1896, Beveridge had opened his own retail business in the rural and mining town of Lithgow and involved himself in various community activities, including in cricket. Reporting on his attendance at a Lithgow reception for Premier Reid in May 1896, the \"Windsor and Richmond Gazette\" noted: \"no doubt, ere long Mr. [Beveridge] will take a leading part in matters connected with the welfare of the town, for he is too good a man to be allowed to stay long in clover. His ability is already recognised in his new home, and a matter of a few months will decide whether he enters the Municipal arena or not. If he does, Lithgow will be the gainer.\" In early 1896 Beveridge nominated to take up a vacancy on Lithgow Ward on Lithgow Municipal Council, but received only 6 votes. The next year he stood again for Lithgow Ward but lost by one vote. Beveridge became heavily involved in local cricket circles, donating the \"Beveridge Cup\" for district matches, and becoming President of the Lithgow District Cricket Association in 1899; the patron of the association that year was prominent local politician Joseph Cook.\n\nA supporter of Australian Federation, Beveridge was nominated to attend the People's Federal Convention at Bathurst in November 1896, which had convened to discuss the 1891 draft Constitution being proposed for the Commonwealth of Australia. The most important recommendation made by the convention was that the Senate should be directly-elected. In December 1897, Beveridge established the Lithgow Land, Building, and Investment Company and became a company director. As a longstanding Justice of the Peace, on 23 January 1899 Beveridge was appointed by Governor Lord Hampden, on the recommendation of Minister for Justice Charles Lee, as Coroner for Lithgow and for the colony at large.\n\nBy 1901, Beveridge had moved again to the Riverina town of Hay, and opened his own general merchandise store, \"Beveridge & Co.\", in the town. It was not long before Beveridge again returned to Cricketing circles, gaining much respect in the Hay Cricket Association, later serving as vice-president, and rising to be President of the Hay Chamber of Commerce in 1901. In February 1901, Beveridge was elected as Honorary Secretary at the inaugural meeting of the Hay Free Trade Association and later assisting in the campaign of Free Trade candidate James Ashton for the seat of Riverina at the first federal election a month later.\nIn May 1902 Beveridge departed Hay for a visit to London for the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.\n\nAfter moving back to Sydney with his family, in later years he served as the general manager of the Merchants' and Traders' Employment Bureau, which his brother Peter had purchased in July 1908. The Bureau's offices were sited within the New York Mutual Life Building at 14 Martin Place, Sydney. Beveridge moved with his family to a new residence, \"Violet\" in Balfour Road, Kensington, but in later years his health suffered greatly owing to \"acute heart trouble\", which led to his death aged 67 on 15 March 1916. His youngest son Lance sergeant Roy Stuart Beveridge (20th Battalion) was later killed in action following the Battle of Flers in France on 12 November 1916. His eldest son Percy Beveridge became a notable cricketer in New Zealand, while his son Cecil became an actor and theatre director and, also of the 20th Battalion, was injured during the Battle of Pozières in 1916. He is interred with his wife (d. 1929) and his third son, Harry (d. 1943, who was a branch manager for the Commonwealth Bank) at Waverley Cemetery.\n"}

Chan and her sisters were confronted by a man in a balaclava with a knife. He forced Chan's sisters into a wardrobe before fleeing with Chan. Before leaving, he spray painted \"Asian drug deal\", \"payback\" and \"more to come\" on a vehicle in their front yard. Police suspect this was a ruse to distract them from the killer's real motive. Chan's mother made an emotional plea on television for Chan's return.\n\nThere had been several abductions of girls in Melbourne prior to the abduction of Chan by an offender known in the media as Mr Cruel. Victoria Police had started scaling down Operation Challenge the day before Chan's abduction that had been established to investigate two abductions in which the victim was raped and an earlier home invasion also involving rape. Detectives believed that Chan would be released the same as previous girls abducted. \n\nOn 6 May 1991, 23 days after Chan's abduction, Victoria Police formed the Spectrum Taskforce to investigate Chan's abduction and to continue Operation Challenge investigations. A reward of $100,000 was offered for information on her abduction.\n\nOn 9 April 1992, Chan's remains were found nearly a year later in a landfill area at Edgars Creek in the suburb of Thomastown. The skull had three bullet holes in the back of the head. The body had probably been there for 12 months. On 31 January 1994, the Spectrum Taskforce was disbanded. The offender was never brought to justice.\n\nAn inquest was held in 1997 with the coroner finding that she met her death through foul play, but it was not possible to identify the person or people responsible.\n\nThe case has remained open with cold case detectives regularly reviewing the investigation. \n\nOn the 25th anniversary of her abduction the reward was increased from $100,000 to $1,000,000.\n\n"}
{"id": "35049383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35049383", "title": "Keeping All Students Safe Act", "text": "Keeping All Students Safe Act\n\nThe Keeping All Students Safe Act refers to a pair of American legislative proposals introduced in the United States House of Representatives on April 6, 2011 as H.R. 1381 and in the Senate on December 16, 2011 as S.2020. The bills are designed to protect children from the abuse of restraint and seclusion in school. The first Congressional bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on December 9, 2007 and named the Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act. The primary sponsors of the two bills are Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Congressman George Miller (D-CA), Ranking Member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, and Congressman Gregg Harper (R-MS).\n\nRestraint involves immobilizing an individual and preventing him or her from moving his or her arms, legs, body, or head freely. Seclusion involves the involuntary confinement of an individual in a room or area from which the individual is physically prevented from leaving, whether the room is locked or the door is blocked by furniture.\n\nIn 2009, the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) undertook a nationwide study of the use of restraint and seclusion in schools and its effects. The GAO found \"hundreds of cases of alleged abuse and death related to the use of these methods on schoolchildren during the past two decades.\" Most of the incidents involved children with disabilities who are enrolled in special education, the GAO reported.\n\nThe GAO documented 20 deaths of children from restraint. The GAO also reported about restraints that resulted in broken arms, and kindergartners who were tied to chairs with duct tape and who suffered bloody noses. One teenager hanged himself in a seclusion room, while a teacher sat outside the room. Before the final episode, he was confined 19 times in a concrete 8 foot by 8 foot room for an average of 94 minutes each time. His parents were never informed. The GAO found that a New York child was placed alone in a seclusion room 75 times in 6 months for whistling and slouching. The National Disability Rights Network and the Council of Parents Attorneys and Advocates also documented the nationwide use of restraint and seclusion in 2009. NDRN documented the use of restraint and seclusion in 2/3 of states in 2009.\n\nOn May 19, 2009, the House Education and Labor Committee held hearings about the use of restraint and seclusion, chaired by Congressman George Miller.\n\nOne witness testified that her 14-year-old son was killed when restrained by his 230-pound teacher, who smothered him by lying on top of him in a restraint during a disagreement about lunch. Another witness testified that her 7-year-old daughter was bruised when she was restrained face down for playing with her tooth, but the parent was never informed by the school. She also testified that her child was later restrained again, and received a severe abrasion, but she was not informed of the restraint. She testified that other children were denied access to food, water, and the bathroom while isolated in seclusion confinement rooms.\n\nThe GAO presented testimony about its report and findings about restraint and seclusion, and the risk of death and injury. The GAO also reported that restraint and seclusion have been used to control minor student misbehaviors such as speaking out of turn or refusing to remain in one’s chair. Another hearing witness testified that restraint may be needed in emergencies. He noted that sometimes educators need to use restraint in emergency situations, where there is a risk that a child will injure himself or others and nothing else will work to prevent the immediate danger. Teachers may use restraint and seclusion appropriately in those circumstances, the witness testified. An Illinois State Board of Education representative presented data from Illinois showing that implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports reduced the use of restraint and seclusion significantly.\n\nThe United States House of Representatives reported that children, most often children with disabilities, are subjected to seclusion and restraint at much higher rates than adults, and are at greater risk of injury as a result of these practices. The House further reported that children under the age of 12 are restrained or secluded at higher rates than any other age group. The House of Representatives also reported that, “the use of restraint and seclusion often exacerbates the behaviors that staff are trying to eliminate.”\n\nBecause there is no federal law, state restraint and seclusion laws control. A 2012 report by Jessica Butler for the Autism National Committee summarized state seclusion and restraint laws and policies. It reported that only 14 states limited the use of restraint to emergencies involving threats of physical injury. Only 11 either banned all forms of seclusion or restricted it to emergency threats of physical harm. There are 27 states that have no requirement to notify parents when a child is restrained or secluded and only 12 states that require same day or next day notification.\n\nAs there is no national clearinghouse that gathers data on the use of the techniques, the exact number of children subjected to restraint and seclusion in school is unknown. The GAO found that only five states kept records. In two of them, Texas and California, there were over 33,000 cases in 2007-08. Many of the children had cognitive disabilities, autism, mental health disabilities, attention deficit disorder and other disabilities. Professor Reece Peterson testified at the House Education and Labor hearing about the need for federal law requiring data collection nationwide.\n\nOn December 9, 2009, six months after the House hearing, the first national restraint and seclusion bill was introduced by Congressman George Miller. It was cosponsored by Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. A companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Chris Dodd.\n\nThe 2009 House bill was numbered H.R. 4247 and entitled “Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act.” The Senate bill was numbered S. 2860 and had the same title.\n\nOn March 3, 2010, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 4247 (now renamed the Keeping All Students Safe Act). The vote was 262-153, with 238 Democrats and 24 Republicans voting in favor. The bill did not pass the Senate. A revised Senate bill, S.3895, was introduced on September 29, 2010, and cosponsored by Senator Dodd and Senator Burr. It did not pass the Senate. Because passage by both houses of Congress is required for the President to consider a bill in America, both bills died at the end of the 111th Congress in December 2010.\n\nRestraint and seclusion bills were introduced again in the 112th Congress in 2011. On April 6, 2011, Congressman George Miller (D-CA), Ranking Member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, reintroduced the Keeping All Students Safe Act, cosponsored by Congressman Greg Harper (R-MS). On December 16, 2011, the second anniversary of Congressman Miller’s first bill, Senator Tom Harkin, Chairman of the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee, introduced a slightly different version of the Keeping All Students Safe Act, S. 2020.\n\nThis section of the article focuses on the two newest bills introduced in the 112th Congress in 2011. The House and Senate versions of the Keeping All Students Safe Act differ.\n\nThe House bill prohibits physical restraint except in emergencies when there is an imminent threat of physical injury and less restrictive measures will not resolve the situation. The Senate bill bars physical restraint unless there is an immediate threat of serious bodily injury and less restrictive measures will not solve the situation. Both bills would forbid the use of restraint or seclusion for destruction of property, educational disruption, failing to follow instructions, and for coercion, discipline, or in place of proper educational planning. \nThe House bill also forbids seclusion unless there is an immediate threat of physical injury and less restrictive methods will not resolve the situation. The House bill will require staff to continuously visually monitor (watch) children who are confined to seclusion rooms to ensure that they are safe. The Senate bill bans all seclusion of children, which is defined as locking children in rooms or other spaces or blocking the door so they cannot leave (e.g., with furniture).\n\nBoth bills require restraint to end when the emergency ends, and the House bill requires seclusion to end when the emergency ends. Both bills ban the use of mechanical restraints, meaning devices that lock and restrain children, or taping or tying them to chairs or furniture. Both bills ban chemical restraints and restraints that impair breathing or otherwise threaten life.\n\nBoth bills require schools to notify parents in writing within 24 hours of restraint and verbally the same day. There are 27 states that do not have legal requirements for schools to tell parents a child was restrained/secluded.\n\nBoth bills impose training requirements to ensure that staff who use restraint and seclusion are trained in evidence-based techniques and that the techniques are not misused in even more dangerous manners. Both bills prohibit putting physical restraint as a planned intervention in Individual Education Programs, 504 plans, behavioral intervention plans, student safety plans, or other educational planning documents for individual students. The bills also require the collection of data nationwide and disaggregating the data by such categories as race, sex, income, and disability status.\n\nThe Senate bill also bans restraints that interfere with the ability to communicate. The GAO reported on at least four cases in which verbal children who died or were injured in restraint told staff that they could not breathe. Numerous children cannot speak or have difficulty doing so, and rely on sign language or augmentative communications devices. Additionally, the Senate bill requires that a debriefing be held, where school staff, the parents, and the student may attend. Debriefings are intended to reduce and eliminate restraint and seclusion, by determining what caused the event and how to avoid it in the future, and by analyzing, planning for, and implementing positive interventions.\n\nWhen Congressman Miller re-introduced the House bill in 2011, he described his reasons for doing so, “In 2009, the Government Accountability Office told our committee of the shocking wave of abuse by untrained school staff who were misusing emergency interventions. Most of these victims were children with disabilities. Some were 3 and 4 years old. In some cases, children died. Restraint and seclusion should be used only as a last resort and by trained professionals, but the GAO found that was not the case. . . . A media report out yesterday highlights that these horrific abuses continued through this past year. In Chicago, a 4-year-old boy’s wrists were taped together with painter’s tape and then duct tape because he refused to take a nap and he didn’t wash his hands.”\n\nSenator Harkin introduced his bill and explained the reasons for doing so. He said, “I am pleased to introduce today the Keeping All Students Safe Act. This important legislation will protect school children against ineffective harmful and life threatening seclusion and restraint practices. . . . Restraint and seclusion-related fatalities and injuries most often involve children with disabilities. This vulnerable population must especially be protected from this type of abuse, and this legislation seeks to do just that. . . .The act does allow for the use of restraint in emergency situations to prevent serious bodily injury to the student, other students in the classroom, or staff, it also requires State-approved crisis intervention training program as to how to approach these types of emergency situations.”\n\nSenator Harkin also addressed data issues, “Another issue uncovered by the GAO study was that no web site, Federal agency, or other entity currently collects comprehensive data related to the use of restraint and seclusion in our Nation's schools. This Act will remedy this situation, as it requires each State educational agency to prepare and submit a report documenting” the use of restraint and seclusion.”\n\nIn March 2012, the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education presented a report about its Civil Rights Data Collection. It reported that students with disabilities made up represent 12% of students in its data collection sample, but nearly 70% of the students who are physically restrained by adults in school. For those schools which reported data, there was a total of 38, 792 incidents of physical restraint. CRDC also found racial and ethnic disproportionality in restraint and seclusion use. African-American students were 21% of students with disabilities under served under the IDEA, but 44% of students with disabilities subjected to mechanical restraint. Hispanic children were disproportionately subjected to seclusion.\n\n"}
{"id": "366589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=366589", "title": "Lithotomy position", "text": "Lithotomy position\n\nThe lithotomy position is a medical term referring to a common position for surgical procedures and medical examinations involving the pelvis and lower abdomen, as well as a common position for childbirth in Western nations. The lithotomy position involves the positioning of an individual's feet above or at the same level as the hips (often in stirrups), with the perineum positioned at the edge of an examination table. References to the position have been found in some of the oldest known medical documents including versions of the Hippocratic oath (see lithotomy); the position is named after the ancient surgical procedure for removing kidney stones and bladder stones via the perineum. The position is perhaps most recognizable as the 'often used' position for childbirth: the patient is laid on the back with knees bent, positioned above the hips, and spread apart through the use of stirrups.\n\nThe position is frequently used and has many obvious benefits from the doctor's perspective. Most notably the position provides good visual and physical access to the perineal region. The position is used for procedures ranging from simple pelvic exams to surgeries and procedures including those involving reproductive organs, urology, and gastrointestinal systems. New observations and scientific findings, combined with a greater sensitivity to patient needs have raised awareness of the physical and psychological risks the position may pose for prolonged surgical procedures, pelvic examinations, and, most notably, childbirth.\n\nSome studies have found a significant relationship between prolonged surgical procedures with the patient in the lithotomy position and a circulatory complication known as compartment syndrome, Nerve injury by pressure is also possible, the femoral or peroneal nerve are at risk.\n\nA Cochrane Review found that the lithotomy position may not be the ideal position for child birth, noting that while it makes care easier for physicians by placing the patient in an easily accessible position, it is often harder on birthing mothers as use of the lithotomy position can narrow the birth canal by up to a third. In lieu of the lithotomy position, the Cochrane Review recommended birthing mothers make informed choices about birthing positions and find the position that is most comfortable for them.\n\nPatients have reported feeling a loss of control and increased sense of vulnerability when examined in the lithotomy position because they cannot see the area being examined. Other, equally effective positions have been suggested for examinations of conscious patients.\n\n\n"}

True's inclusion in the book garnered him some attention in ultrarunning circles, and some readers credited him as their inspiration for taking up the sport.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 90s True spent several months per year trail running in Central America. In 2003 True decided to organize a race for the Tarahumara people in Mexico that would help them preserve their culture and running heritage. True died on March 27, 2012, during a run in the Gila Wilderness, part of the Gila National Forest in southwestern New Mexico.\n\nMicah True was born \"Michael Randall Hickman\" in Oakland, California, the son of a World War II Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant and the second of four children. He grew up traveling the country as his family relocated to various nationally located Marine Corps bases. His family was conservative Roman Catholic, but True aligned himself with the counter-culture movement of the 1960s and 70s.\n\nTrue attended Humboldt State University, where he studied Eastern religions and Native American history. To earn money he began prizefighting in informal boxing bouts, using the name \"Gypsy Cowboy,\" and perhaps taking the occasional dive for an easy payday. Between 1974 and 1982, Hickman was a professional middleweight boxer, fighting under the name Mike \"True\" Hickman. His career record was 9 wins (KO 2), 11 losses (KO 9), and 0 draws.\n\nAt some point True spent 10 months living in a cave in Hawaii where he fell in love with a rich girl. It was when she left him, he said, that he took up long-distance running. He also changed his name from Michael Hickman to Micah True. (The name Micah comes from the Bible, while True came from the name of a beloved pet: True Dog.)\n\nBy 1982 True had moved to Boulder, Colorado, where he began working as a self-employed furniture mover. By then he had become a \"trailrunning bum\" (like a \"surfing bum or a climbing bum\"). For almost 20 years, he spent winters running in Mexico, Guatemala, and Central America, averaging per week. He would return to Boulder during the summers to earn enough money to live on the rest of the year. Among villagers he became known as \"El Caballo Blanco\" or \"The White Horse\" for his long blond hair and pale skin.\n\nIn 1993 True came in contact with the Tarahumara or Rarámuri runners from Chihuahua, Mexico. In 1994 he began spending his winters running in the Copper Canyons, where he built a hut and began establishing a relationship with the Tarahumara natives.\n\nIn 2003 True decided to organize a race for the Tarahumara natives that would help them preserve their culture and running heritage. The first Copper Canyon Ultra Marathon was held on March 23, 2003; though turnout was small, it became an annual tradition.\n\nIn 2006 True got the idea of having American ultrarunners to compete with the Tarahumara. After initially reaching out on the internet, he wrote an article in \"Men's Health\", elucidating many of the lessons he internalized from the Tarahumara people. He also contacted Christopher McDougall, a writer for \"Men's Health\", who would later write the book \"\".\n\nThe 2012 event took place on March 12 and was the largest ever with hundreds of participants. Most were local Tarahumara, known for their running endurance, both as a general means of travel and while participating in ceremonial, team-based, long distance running events, most famously the Rarajipari, or ball game. In addition to prize money for the top ten finishers, the event awards seed corn vouchers to all runners who complete the distance. The race has its start and finish in the town square of Urique, Chihuahua, Mexico, covering an estimated of single track trail and dirt road.\n\nIn 2009 True was featured prominently in Christopher McDougall's best selling book \"\". The book told the story of the Copper Canyons ultra marathon and the Tarahumara, while promoting the endurance running hypothesis, arguing that humans left the forests and moved to the savannas by developing the ability to run long distances in order to hunt prey by simply outlasting them in a long chase.\n\nBecoming a central character in a best selling book changed True's life significantly. Previously he had lived a quiet simple life, not seeing himself as the eccentric and amazing person in the book. He said he sometimes felt like he had to \"live up to the expectations of the book\" and told people that the book contained exaggerations and inaccuracies. Nevertheless, he became active on Facebook where he encouraged people to follow him. It was through Facebook that he met Maria Walton, who became his girlfriend for the last two years of his life.\n\nTrue also began using his celebrity status to help raise funds for the annual Copper Canyon race. He spoke at various events, beginning with a Saucony sponsored event in Utah, and then eventually traveling to Sweden, Denmark, and England. According to Walton, True was never comfortable with his fame, only wanting to be known as someone who was genuine and real.\n\nOn March 27, 2012, True failed to return after heading out for a run in the Gila Wilderness, part of the Gila National Forest in southwestern New Mexico. He departed from the Wilderness Lodge in Gila, saying he was going for a 12-mile (19 km) run. A subsequent mountain rescue effort involved three aircraft and at least nine search and rescue teams in off-road vehicles and on horseback, looking across of high desert.\nSearchers included ultra-runners such as Scott Jurek, Kyle Skaggs, Timothy Olson, and many athletes and friends who had participated in the 51 mile Copper Canyon Ultra Marathon.\n\nOn March 31 True was found dead with his legs dangling in a stream. The local sheriff said there were \"no obvious signs of trauma\", although True had scrapes and abrasions on his hands, arms, and knees, suggesting a fall. His remains were removed by horseback. Because of difficult terrain and remote location, the recovery was not completed until April 1. An autopsy was inconclusive with respect to the actual cause of death, revealing, however, that True was suffering from idiopathic cardiomyopathy, which had caused the left ventricle of his heart to become enlarged. The autopsy report of the Office of the Medical Investigator of New Mexico noted that \"the decedent did not have a regular physician and no medical records, particularly electrocardiograms or blood pressure readings were available for review\" and \"the best determination is that of unclassified cardiomyopathy which resulted in a cardiac dysrhythmia during exertion.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. James O'Keefe Jr., the director of Preventative Cardiology Fellowship Program and the Director of Preventative Cardiology at Cardiovascular Consultants at the Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute, a large cardiology practice in Kansas City, looked at the pathology report and believes that Micah True's enlarged thickened heart with scar tissue is a pathology some extreme endurance athletes develop termed Phidippides cardiomyopathy by Peter A. McCullough in research conducted with Justin E. Trivax. According to McCullough and Trivax's hypothesis, \"this pathology occurs because endurance sports call for a sustained increase in cardiac output for several hours\" which puts the heart \"into a state of volume overload. It has been shown that approximately one-third of marathon runners experience dilation of the right atrium and ventricle, have elevations of cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptides, and in a smaller fraction later develop small patches of cardiac fibrosis that are the likely substrate for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.\"\n\nA simple memorial gathering was held at Colorado Chautauqua in Boulder on April 6, in which friends ran up Flagstaff Mountain in Colorado and assembled on the Chautauqua park lawn to swap stories and remembrances of him.\n\nDue to True's role in the organization and production of the Copper Canyon Ultramarathon, after his death the continuation of the event was placed in doubt. Soon after True's death, the charitable foundation Norawas de Raramuri was formed again as part of an effort to keep the Copper Canyon race going. It was decided the event would continue under the direction of Micah True's girlfriend Maria Walton and Fuego y Agua Events LLC. Director Josue Stephens. In honor of Micah, the race has since taken the name by which it has always been known in Mexico, Ultramaraton Caballo Blanco.\n\n\n\n"}

In modern times corpses have customarily been refrigerated to delay decomposition.\n\n\"Mortuary\" early 14c., from Anglo-French mortuarie \"gift to a parish priest from a deceased parishioner,\" from Medieval Latin mortuarium, noun use of neuter of Late Latin adjective mortuarius \"pertaining to the dead,\" from Latin \"mortuus\", pp. of \"mori\" \"to die\" (see mortal (adj.)). Meaning \"place where bodies are kept temporarily\" first recorded 1865, a euphemism for earlier English term \"deadhouse.\"\n\n\"Morgue\" from the French \"morgue\", which means 'to look at solemnly, to defy'. First used to describe the inner wicket of a prison, where new prisoners were kept so that jailers and turnkeys could recognize them in the future, it took on its modern meaning in fifteenth-century Paris, being used to describe part of the Châtelet used for the storage and identification of unknown corpses.\n\n\"Morgue\" is predominantly used in North American English, while \"mortuary\" is more common in British English, although both terms are used interchangeably. The euphemisms “Rose Cottage” and “Rainbow’s End” are sometimes used in British hospitals to enable discussion in front of patients, the latter mainly for children.\n\nA person responsible for handling and washing bodies is now known as a diener, morgue attendant, or autopsy technician.\n\nThere are two types of mortuary cold chambers:\nBodies are kept between 2 °C (36 °F) and 4 °C (39 °F). While this is usually used for keeping bodies for up to several weeks, it does not prevent decomposition, which continues at a slower rate than at room temperature.\n\nBodies are kept at between −10 °C (14 °F) and −50 °C (−58 °F). Usually used at forensic institutes, particularly when a body has not been identified. At these temperatures the body is completely frozen and decomposition is very much reduced.\n\nIn some countries, the body of the deceased is embalmed before disposal, which makes refrigeration unnecessary.\n\nIn many countries, the family of the deceased must make the burial within 72 hours (three days) of death, but in some other countries it is usual that burial takes place some weeks or months after the death. This is why some corpses are kept as long as one or two years at a hospital or in a funeral home. When the family has enough money to organize the ceremony, the corpse is taken from the cold chamber for burial.\n\nIn some funeral homes, the morgue is in the same room, or directly adjacent to, the specially designed ovens, known as retorts, that are used in funerary cremation. Some religions dictate that, should a body be cremated, the family must witness its incineration. To honor these religious rites, many funeral homes install a viewing window, which allows the family to watch as the body is inserted into the retort. In this way, the family can honor their customs without entering the morgue.\n\nOversized mortuary fridge spaces have been installed in British hospitals to cope with the increase in obesity.\n\nA waiting mortuary is a mortuary building designed specifically for the purpose of confirming that deceased persons are truly deceased. Prior to the advent of modern methods of verifying death, people feared that they would be buried alive. To alleviate such fears, the recently deceased were housed for a time in waiting mortuaries, where attendants would watch for signs of life. The corpses would be allowed to decompose partially prior to burial. Waiting mortuaries were most popular in 19th-century Germany, and were often large, ornate halls.\n\nA bell was strung to the corpses to alert attendants of any motion. Although there is no documented case of a person being saved from accidental burial in this way,\nit is sometimes erroneously believed that this was the origin of the phrase “saved by the bell”, whilst in fact, the phrase originates from the sport of boxing.\n\nIn American English:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6501264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6501264", "title": "New Haven Black Panther trials", "text": "New Haven Black Panther trials\n\nIn 1970 there was a series of criminal prosecutions in New Haven, Connecticut against various members of the Black Panther Party. The charges ranged from criminal conspiracy to felony murder. All indictments stemmed from the murder of 19-year-old Alex Rackley in the early hours of May 21, 1969. The trials became a rallying-point for the American Left, and marked a decline in public support, even among the black community, for the Black Panther Party.\n\nOn May 19, 1969, members of the Black Panther Party kidnapped fellow Panther Alex Rackley, who had fallen under suspicion of informing for the FBI. He was held captive at the New Haven Panther headquarters on Orchard Street, where he was tortured and interrogated for two days until he confessed. His interrogation was tape recorded by the Panthers. During that time, national party chairman Bobby Seale visited New Haven and spoke on the campus of Yale University for the Yale Black Ensemble Theater Company. After his speech, Seale briefly stopped by the headquarters where Rackley was being held captive, though it was never proven that he went inside or knew about Rackley's treatment.\n\nEarly the next day, three Panthers - Warren Kimbro, Lonnie McLucas, and national Panther \"Field Marshal\" George Sams, Jr. - drove Rackley to the nearby town of Middlefield, Connecticut. Kimbro shot Rackley once in the head and McLucas shot him once in the chest. They dumped his corpse in the Coginchaug River, where it was discovered the next day.\n\nPolice raided the Panther headquarters, eventually arresting nine New Haven area Black Panthers (in addition to two juveniles). McLucas and Sams were captured later.\n\nSams and Kimbro confessed to the murder, and agreed to testify against McLucas in exchange for a reduction in sentence. Sams also implicated Seale in the killing, telling his interrogators that while visiting the Panther headquarters on the night of his speech, Seale had directly ordered him to murder Rackley. In all, nine defendants were indicted on charges related to the case. In the heated political rhetoric of the day, these defendants were referred to as the \"New Haven Nine\", a deliberate allusion to other \"cause-celebre\" defendants like the \"Chicago Seven\".\n\nThe first trial was that of Lonnie McLucas, the only person who physically took part in the killing who refused to plead guilty. In fact, McLucas had confessed to shooting Rackley, but since some of the charges brought against him made him eligible for the death penalty, a not-guilty plea was the only logical trial strategy.\n\nJury selection began in May 1970. The case and trial were already a national \"cause célèbre\" among critics of the Nixon administration, and especially among those hostile to the actions of the FBI. Under the Bureau's then-secret \"Counter-Intelligence Program\" (COINTELPRO), FBI director J. Edgar Hoover had ordered his agents to disrupt, discredit, or otherwise neutralize radical groups like the Panthers. Hostility between groups organizing political dissent and the Bureau was, by the time of the trials, at a fever pitch. Hostility from the left was also directed at the two Panthers cooperating with the prosecutors. Sams in particular, never widely popular in the movement, was accused of being an informant, and lying to implicate Seale to hide his own complicity with the FBI.\n\nBeginning with the pretrial proceedings, tens of thousands of supporters of the Panthers arrived in New Haven individually and in organized groups. They were housed and fed by community organizations and by sympathetic Yale students in their dormitory rooms. The Yale college dining halls provided basic meals for everyone. Protesters met daily \"en masse\" on the New Haven Green across the street from the Courthouse (and one hundred yards from Yale's main gate) to hear protest speakers. Among the speakers were Jean Genet, Benjamin Spock, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and John Froines (an assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Oregon). Teach-ins and other events were also held in the colleges themselves.\n\nTowards midnight on May 1, two bombs exploded in Yale's Ingalls Rink, where a concert was being held in conjunction with the protests. Although the rink was damaged, no one was injured, and no culprit was identified.\n\nYale chaplain William Sloane Coffin stated, \"All of us conspired to bring on this tragedy by law enforcement agencies by their illegal acts against the Panthers, and the rest of us by our immoral silence in front of these acts,\" while Yale President Kingman Brewster Jr. issued the statement, \"I personally want to say that I'm appalled and ashamed that things should have come to such a pass that I am skeptical of the ability of Black revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the U.S.\" Brewster's generally sympathetic tone enraged many of the university's older, more conservative alumni, heightening tensions within the school community.\n\nAs tensions mounted, Yale officials sought to avoid deeper unrest and to deflect the real possibility of riots or violent student demonstrations. Sam Chauncey has been credited with winning tactical management on behalf of the administration to quell anxiety among law enforcement and New Haven's citizens, while Kurt Schmoke, a future Rhodes Scholar, mayor of Baltimore, MD and Dean of Howard University School of Law, has received kudos as undergraduate spokesman to the faculty during some of the protest's tensest moments. Ralph Dawson, a classmate of Schmoke's, figured prominently as moderator of the Black Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY).\n\nIn the end, compromises between the administration and the students quashed the possibility of violence. While Yale (and many other colleges) went \"on strike\" from May Day until the end of the term, like most schools it was not actually \"shut down\". Classes were made \"voluntarily optional\" for the time and students were graded \"Pass/Fail\" for the work done up to then.\n\nMcLucas's trial set new records for the scale of judicial proceedings in Connecticut. It was the first in Connecticut to have metal detectors installed at the courtroom doors; jury selection took six weeks, a Connecticut record, and the jury deliberated for six days, another Connecticut record. Despite impassioned accusations from protesters that McLucas was being railroaded into the electric chair by a \"racist jury,\" the jurors (ten white, two black) acquitted him on the most severe charges, convicting him instead on the sole charge of conspiracy to commit murder. His defense attorney declared, \"The judge was fair, the jury was fair, and, in this case, a black revolutionary was given a fair trial.\" McLucas was sentenced to twelve to fifteen years in prison. His two collaborators in the murder, who had pleaded to second degree murder, were released after four years.\n\nIn October, 1970, Bobby Seale went on trial alongside Ericka Huggins, founder of the New Haven chapter. This trial was an even larger undertaking, involving a full four months of jury selection. Seale's attorney emphasized that it was only Sams' testimony that tied Seale to Rackley's murder. Huggins's voice was heard on a tape recording of the victim's interrogation, played for the jury. Her lawyer argued that Huggins had been acting under duress. The jury was unable to reach a verdict, deadlocked 11 to 1 for Seale's acquittal and 10 to 2 for Huggins' acquittal. On May 25, 1971 Judge Harold Mulvey stunned courtroom spectators by dismissing the charges against Huggins and Seale saying, \"I find it impossible to believe that an unbiased jury could be selected without superhuman efforts -- efforts which this court, the state and these defendants should not be called upon either to make or to endure\".\n\nBoth the Panthers and the FBI suffered damage to their reputations, after the public exposure of their most unsavory activities.\n\nIn 1971, a group of left-wing radicals calling themselves the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI burglarized an FBI field office in Media, Pennsylvania, which was found to be spying on Swarthmore College students and faculty. Among the materials stolen in this break-in were documents revealing the nature of the COINTELPRO program. Within the year, Director Hoover declared that the centralized COINTELPRO was over.\n\nFor the Panthers, the Seale trial may have been the height of their national exposure and their popularity among the broader left-wing movement. A string of violent confrontations with law-enforcement, along with the trials and convictions of national party leaders that followed, left the movement spent and adrift, and by the mid-1970s it was largely inactive.\n\nThe trial surfaced again in the news in 2000, when former first lady Hillary Clinton ran for U.S. Senate in the state of New York. Anti-Clinton activists discovered that during the trials, Clinton (then a Yale law student named Hillary Rodham) volunteered to monitor the trial for violations of civil rights, for the American Civil Liberties Union. Widely circulated mass e-mails erroneously ascribed to Clinton responsibility for \"getting the defendants off,\" and also blamed the future head of the Clinton U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, Bill Lann Lee, who was a Yale undergraduate at the time. Although both were much too junior to have had any role in the actual legal defense, according to John Elvin of the conservative newsmagazine \"Insight on the News\", \"Insight reviewed biographies of Hillary Clinton by Milton, [David] Brock and Roger Morris for this story and lengthy selections from such other biographies as Barbara Olson's Hell to Pay. Together, relying on primary and other firsthand sources, they unquestionably back David Horowitz's contention that Hillary was a campus leader during the Panther protests\"; Lee apparently played no prominent role in any protests.\n\nIn 2006, Kelly Moye revealed that he was a police informant recruited to infiltrate the Panthers by Nick Pastore, head of New Haven Police's Intelligence Division. George Sams held a gun to Moye's head and demanded he turn over his car. Rackley was driven to his death in Moye's car. The police followed Moye's car as it left toward the murder destination but lost sight of the car prior to the murder. The State Police discovered Rackley's body the next day. This epilogue was detailed in an article \"After 37 Years, Spy Comes In From Cold\" by Paul Bass, author of Murder In The Model City: The Black Panthers, Yale and the Redemption of a Killer.\n\nDetective Nick Pastore, who arrested Seale and brought him to New Haven to stand trial, went on to become New Haven's Chief of Police, widely renowned for his successful policy of community policing, and now heads a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington, DC named Criminal Justice Policy. Thirty one years later, when Seale returned to New Haven to speak at the Yale Repertory Theatre, Pastore decided to attend and even presented Seale with a pink porcelain pig and a hug, congratulating him for continuing \"the struggle\".\n\n\n"}

Obo (1882–1895), was an American Cocker Spaniel who is considered to be the father of the modern breed, though physically, he was different from today's American Cocker. During his day, he was a successful show dog, winner of many Best-in-Show titles.\n\nThe Obo kennel of Spaniels were owned by James Farrow, who was breeding dogs from the 1870s onwards. Obo's sire and namesake, Obo, was whelped on June 14, 1879. F. E. Schofield, an authority on Spaniels, wrote, \"Obo, it goes without saying, was the greatest force in the revival of the Cocker.\" Obo was so well known for his victories in conformation shows that his owner, Farrow, spoke of an offer made from America, \"The dog's stock did so well in America that one hundred guineas was offered by an American breeder for the use of this Spaniel for one season's stud service. The offer was refused.\"\n\nJ. P. Willey of Salmon Falls, New Hampshire, was already a cocker spaniel breeder in America when he attempted to purchase Obo from Farrow in England. He was turned down, but managed to purchase Chloe II, a successful female Cocker Spaniel show dog and had her mated to Obo prior to her being shipped to the United States.\n\nFrom Chloe II's litter came two males, Obo and Black Silk, and a female named Black Gem. Black Gem would die from distemper after returning from winning the Produce Stake at a New York show.\nObo was shown for the first time at Manchester, New Hampshire in September 1883, where he placed first. He would go on to have further wins at Lowell, New Haven, Connecticut and New York City. Obo II's trophy for Best Cocker Spaniel from the New Haven Kennel Club show in 1884 was gifted to the American Spaniel Club in 2004. Obo's American Kennel Club number was 4911.\n\nHis puppies were also highly successful, winning puppy prizes at Lowell, first and second at New York and the top three puppy places at New Haven. Four of his best known offspring are Red Brucie, Sandspring Surmise, Midcliff Miracle Man and Limestone Laddie. In addition, Obo II was the sire of the first dark red Cocker Spaniel in America, Little Miss Rover.\n\nModern writers consider Obo to be the father of the modern American Cocker Spaniel. He was different from the modern breed, being tall with a long body.\n\nObo died on January 2, 1895, and was buried on the property of his owner in Salmon Falls village in Rollinsford. Today, the grave is located behind the Rollinsford Grade School in the town of Rollinsford. At the request of the American Spaniel Club, the grave site was registered with the Rollinsford Historical Society as a historical monument.\n. The gravestone is listed to the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing resource to Rollinsford Grade School. \nObo was the first American example of the Obo type which was recognisable on both sides of the Atlantic in many dogs with the prefix \"Obo\" or \"Omo\". H. S. Lloyd in the 1939 edition of \"The Popular Cocker Spaniel\" pointed out that compared to the Cocker Spaniel breed of the 1930s that the Obo type was low to the ground and a \"trifle full in eye\".\n\n"}

He was a member of the Ottonian dynasty, the only son of Duke Liudolf of Swabia and his wife Ida, and thus a grandson of the Emperor Otto I and his Anglo-Saxon wife Eadgyth. His sister Mathilde was the abbess of Essen Abbey.\n\nOtto was only three years old when his father died in 957. He was raised at the court of his grandfather, Otto I, who seems to have adopted him and raised him alongside his own son, the future Emperor Otto II, born late in 955. The latter regarded him as both \"nephew and brother\" (\"nepos ac frater\"). When the childless Duke Burchard III of Swabia died in 973, Otto II transferred the Swabian duchy to his nineteen-year-old nephew and brother, whose father had been Burchard's predecessor. The elder Otto became a close confidante of his younger sovereign.\n\nIn 976 the imprisoned Duke Henry the Wrangler of Bavaria was formally dismissed from office for rebellion. In his place the emperor appointed Otto of Swabia, who became the first ruler of two duchies in medieval Germany. The Duchy of Carinthia and the March of the Nordgau were also taken from Henry, but were not bestowed on Otto, thus their history is separate from that of Bavaria from this point on. In 977, while the emperor was campaigning elsewhere, Otto helped crush the revolt of the Three Henries—the deposed duke of Bavaria, Bishop Henry I of Augsburg and Duke Henry I of Carinthia—by successfully besieging the leaders in Passau. The army of Bavarians that was ambushed by Boleslaus I of Bohemia near Plzeň while on its way to join the emperor at this time may have been sent by Duke Otto.\n\nIn 980 Otto accompanied the emperor on his south Italian campaign, fighting both the Byzantines and the Sicilian Arabs. He survived the defeat near Crotone on 13/14 July 982 and a subsequent ambush by an Arab force. Assigned to take the news of the campaign back to Germany, he died \"en route\", of wounds received in battle, either 31 October or 1 November, at Lucca. His father had also died south of the Alps. His family brought his body back and had it buried in the at Aschaffenburg, which Otto had generously endowed. His death is noted in the contemporary Abingdon version of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\": \"And then, as he went home, his [the emperor's] brother's son, who was called Otto, passed away; and he was the son of the aetheling Liudolf, and this Liudolf was son of Otto the Elder and King Edward's daughter\".\n\nOtto's sister Mathilde endowed a precious \"crux gemmata\" (jewelled cross), the Cross of Otto and Mathilde, which is kept in the Essen Cathedral Treasury; the siblings are pictured on it. Otto never married and left no children.\n\n"}
{"id": "38977046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38977046", "title": "Oxytocin treatment for postpartum depression", "text": "Oxytocin treatment for postpartum depression\n\nOxytocin Treatment for Postpartum Depression\n\nOxytocin (OT) has potential to be a treatment for Postpartum Depression (PPD). Oxytocin is released when a mother cares for her child, making the interaction pleasurable. Mothers that report high levels of infant-mother bonding and demonstrate responsive and sensitive parenting generally show increased levels of OT and brain reward center activation during play sessions. According to Slattery and Neumann, the oxytocin system of mothers experiencing PPD may have altered activity. These mothers have trouble bonding with their infants when they are born. An experiment found that mothers, who have low attachment ratings to adults and their infants, also have lower levels of OT when caring for their children. It is thought that women experiencing PPD may benefit from intranasal OT because this treatment would help the mother feel happier and assist her in bonding with the child . Another experiment shows that administering OT to a mother sheep increases the amount of care that she gives to offspring . Further experimentation needs to be done in order to determine the effectiveness of OT as a treatment for Postpartum Depression.\n\nIntranasal (IN) administration, as opposed to more conventional routes, such as oral or intravenous infusion, offers an alternative method for drug delivery. This method is often the preferred method. Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide that can be administered in this manner. IN delivery methods are gaining popularity due to the non-invasive nature of the method. IN generally does not require complicated sterile preparations, is relatively painless, and often can be administered quickly by a medical doctor, or in some cases the patient. IN maximizes the convenience and comfort of the patient, making a treatment regimen more likely to be followed. During Postpartum Depression (PPD), some women may be less likely to seek treatment if treatment is inconvenient. In addition, new mothers (especially if suffering with depression) may feel socially isolated or overwhelmed by responsibilities of caring for a new infant. IN not only provides a convenient delivery method, but is also a logical choice based on efficacy. Tissue in nasal cavities is highly vascular, providing a large surface area for absorption. Large surface areas allow for quick drug onset, meaning greater potential for the drug to reach the central nervous system without undergoing first-pass metabolism. Avoiding first-pass metabolism allows more of the drug to be available for treatment. Gastrointestinal discomfort and digestive side-effects can also be avoided by IN dosage. IN delivery allows OT to cross the blood brain barrier, expediting the drug to the central nervous system and cerebrospinal fluid. The blood-brain-barrier normally protects the brain by blocking certain chemicals and toxins from reaching the brain. Increased levels of OT can be found in salivary samples after intranasal administration of the neuropeptide. Salivary OT levels can remain higher than baseline levels four hours after dosage, suggesting that OT is still producing an active response. This may be an effective way of monitoring levels of OT levels during short-term treatment or help identify women at risk of or have a history of PPD. Though OT can be administrered intravenously (and is sometimes the appropriate method depending on the medical situation), IN administration offers many advantages that make it an ideal choice for short-term treatment.\n\nA review of 38 randomized and controlled trials suggests that short-term use of intranasal oxytocin appears to have few side-effects, with no difference when compared to a placebo group. Short-term use of intranasal oxytocin (OT) appears to be equally safe in vulnerable individuals as well as those deemed healthy. Three adverse incidents have been reported; two were thought to be caused by actual misuse of the nasal spray and one was linked with a more lengthy treatment regimen. The most frequently reported subjective sensation was calmness; however, there were no detectable differences between groups of OT use and placebo. Given that Postpartum Depression (PPD) is not a chronic illness in nature, short-term intranasal OT treatment may be a logical application to alleviate some of the negative consequences associated with PPD. Effects of OT that may be beneficial are reduced levels of anxiety, increased trust levels and increased eye gaze, all which could be beneficial side-effects for women suffering from PPD. Duration of treatment seems to be a key factor in safety. Allergic reactions, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular conditions should always be considered, but especially so if treatment is long-term. OT can modify heart rates and cause excessive fluid intake (antidiuretic effect). Intravenous infusion (IV) of oxytocin is often used to induce labor and enhance milk lactation during postpartum care. IV use can cause side-effects such as cardiovascular manifestations in the form of tachycardia and bradycardia. In addition, nausea, vomiting, and headaches can occur with IV application. Less frequently, water intoxication, skin rash, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported.\n\nIntranasal oxytocin (OT) has been used to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with Postpartum Depression (PPD). Research by McErlean and Dadds suggests that intranasal OT, when combined with behavioral interventions, can remediate some of the mother-infant disturbances associated with PPD. This was the first study to evaluate both the individual effects of OT and the combined effects of OT in conjunction with maternal coaching. The study consisted of seventy-seven mothers (with sub-clinical levels of PPD) with infants ranging from eight to thirty weeks. In addition to the mother-baby interaction coaching, randomly selected mothers were treated with either 24IU OT or a placebo nasal spray over a period of two sessions; measurements were taken over a course of three time periods. Both questionnaire data and observational data, such as eye contact, positive vocalizations, and interaction quality, were used for evaluation purposes. There were significant interactions between the therapy and the OT in regard to maternal behavior. OT also seemed to benefit those mothers who were not involved with the therapy when compared to those that received the placebo nasal spray. OT has also been linked with lowering the human stress response. Lowering a stress response in women that are suffering from PPD may be beneficial to the infant-mother bond. Studies have shown that breast-feeding causes levels of plasma OT to increase in women. Experiments designed and performed in the 1980s helped researchers understand the correlation between breastfeeding prior to a stressful event and the decreased stress response observed during the peripartum period. As part of this experiment, lactating women were asked to either breastfeed their infant or hold their infant for a fifteen-minute period approximately thirty minutes before being subjected to a Trier Stress Test (TSST). During the TSST, women were asked to give an unprepared speech and calculate mental arithmetic in front of an audience. Results indicate that the women that breastfed their infant exhibited less stress during the TSST in comparison to the women that just held their infant. Rising OT levels during breastfeeding may contribute to the lower stress situation.\n\n"}

Professor Cyril Toumanoff suggests AD 116–132 as the years of Pharasmanes’ reign. He features in several Classical accounts.\n\nThe medieval Georgian annals report Pharasmanes' joint rule with Pharasmanes Avaz, diarchs (one source has the extra pair: Rok and Mihrdat), but several modern scholars consider the Iberian diarchy unlikely as it is not corroborated by the contemporary evidence. Pharasmanes is reported to have been the son of his predecessor, King Amazasp I. He is said to have married Ghadana, daughter of King Vologases III of Parthia who ruled in Armenia. According to the medieval \"Life of Kings\", the traditional friendship of the two dyarchs soured at the instigation of the Iranian wife of Mihrdat. Toumanoff regards this information a back-projection of the historically recorded enmity of Pharasmanes I of Iberia and his brother Mithridates of Armenia. The chronicle then continues a story of an Armenian-Roman alliance and their invasion of the Iranian-backed Iberia in which Pharasmanes finds his death.\n\nThe \"Georgian royal annals\" describe Pharasmanes in the following way:\nThe contemporary Classical authors, with more solid historical background, focus on Pharasmanes’ uneasy relations with Rome. He refused in 129 to come and pay homage to the emperor Hadrian.\n\nAccording to the Aelius Spartianus, one of the authors of Augustan History:\nPharasmanes then went touring the East, and prompted the Alans to attack the neighboring Roman provinces by giving them a passage through his realm, even though the emperor had sent him greater gifts including a war elephant, than to any other king of the East. In his pique, Hadrian dressed some 300 criminals in the gold-embroidered cloaks which were part of the return gift of Pharasmanes, and sent them into the arena.\n\nAccording to Spartianus:\nEventually, the ancient sources report a highly honored visit paid by Pharasmanes to Hadrian’s successor Antoninus Pius. According to Cassius Dio, he came to Rome as guest of Antoninus Pius, together with his wife, son, and noble retinue where he was especially honored, being allowed to sacrifice in the Capitol and to have his equestrian statue in the temple of Bellona, and also the emperor increased the territory of his kingdom. This Pharasmanes, however, might have been Pharasmanes III, Pharasmanes II’s possible grandson. This visit was recorded on a fragment of the Fasti Ostienses.\n\nAccording to the \"Georgian royal annals\" King Pharasmanes was poisoned by the chef sent by the Parthians.\n"}

It had been on public display in a glass cabinet during the \"Sport with Stamps\" Stanley Gibbons Stampex rare stamp exhibition at Methodist Central Hall in Westminster. The thief evaded the round-the-clock security, and ignored rare stamps with a value of £3 million to steal the silver-gilt trophy, which was generally thought to be worth far less.\n\nA telephone call from a man who called himself \"Jackson\" to Joe Mears, chairman of Chelsea F.C. and The Football Association, alerted him that a package would be left at Stamford Bridge the following day: it contained a £15,000 ransom demand, accompanied by the removable lining from the top of the trophy. The package was turned over to the police, who arranged to meet \"Jackson\". However, when they arrested the man who had mailed the package, whose real name was Edward Betchley, he claimed that he was a middleman, and the real culprit, a man he called \"The Pole\", was never identified. Betchley was eventually convicted for demanding money with menace, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. If indeed there were other persons involved in the theft, no one else has ever been found. \n\nThe rest of the trophy was found on Sunday 27 March, just seven days after it was stolen, wrapped in newspaper lying by the front wheel of a neighbor's car in Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood, South London, by the four-year-old Pickles, while taking a walk with his owner, David Corbett, who worked as a Thames lighterman. Suspicion of involvement in the theft was attached briefly to David Corbett. When England won the trophy, as a reward, Pickles was invited to the celebration banquet.\n\nCorbett collected nearly £5,000 as a reward. He used the money to buy a house in Lingfield, Surrey, in 1967. Pickles was awarded the silver medal of the National Canine Defence League.\n\nThe Football Association had a replica of the cup made in base metal, for publicity use, so the gold original could be kept safe. The original cup was awarded permanently to Brazil after the 1970 FIFA World Cup, but it was stolen from the headquarters of Brazilian Football Confederation in Rio de Janeiro in December 1983 and never recovered. The replica was bought by FIFA at auction in 1987 for £254,000, and it is held by the National Football Museum in Manchester.\n\nPickles starred with Eric Sykes and June Whitfield in the 1966 film \"The Spy with a Cold Nose\". He also appeared on several television programmes, including \"Blue Peter\" and \"Magpie\". He was also named \"Dog of the Year\", and awarded a year of free food by pet food manufacturer Spillers.\n\nPickles died in 1967 when he was strangled by his choke chain lead that caught on a tree branch while he was eating cheddar cheese near his new home in Surrey.\nHe was buried in his owner's back garden, and his collar is on display in the National Football Museum in Manchester.\n\nAn entirely fictional version of the story was told in a 2006 ITV drama written by Michael Chaplin, called \"Pickles: The Dog Who Won The World Cup\". He was voiced by Harry Enfield.\n\nA plaque was put up in September 2018, near the spot where Pickles found the World Cup Trophy on Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood.\n\n"}
{"id": "33648959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33648959", "title": "SS Bannockburn", "text": "SS Bannockburn\n\nThe steamship Bannockburn was a Canadian registered steel-hulled freighter which disappeared on Lake Superior in snowy weather on November 21, 1902. She was sighted by the captain of a passing vessel, the SS \"Algonquin\", around noon of that day but minutes later disappeared. The wreck of the ship has never been found, with the exception of an oar and a life preserver, and no bodies were ever recovered. Within a year of her disappearance she acquired a reputation as a ghost ship and became known as The Flying Dutchman of the Great Lakes.\n\nThe \"Bannockburn\" had technically sunk once before, on the morning of October 15, 1897: under Captain John Irving, laden with grain and destined for Kingston, Ontario from Chicago, Illinois, she had struck the wing wall of Lock No. 17 of Welland Canal and sprung a leak sending her to the bottom of the shallow canal where she took on nine feet of water before coming to rest. However, no lives were lost and she was raised afterward. She had also been badly damaged several months prior when she ran on the rocks near Snake Island Light on the morning of April 27 while at full speed—however, after dumping 30,000 bushels of grain cargo she was able to float and again no lives were lost though her forefoot and frame were badly stove in.\n\nThe final voyage of the \"Bannockburn\" began at the Canadian lakehead near what is now known as Thunder Bay, under Captain George R. Wood. She was downbound carrying 85,000 bushels of wheat, leaving the city of Fort William on November 20 and headed for Georgian Bay. She suffered a slight grounding but no apparent damage on her way out to the open lake, and her departure was delayed one day. She recommenced her journey on the 21st. Sometime that day, Captain James McMaugh of the upbound \"Algonquin\", another lake freighter, reported viewing her through binoculars about to the southeast of him, about off Keweenaw Point and off Isle Royale. He was well-acquainted with her profile and he stated that he viewed her \"several times\" over the course of a few minutes to note her progress, which was very nearly on course. At a certain moment, however, he attempted to spot her and was surprised that he was unable to do so. He blamed this sudden disappearance on the somewhat foggy weather, and dismissed it.\n\nA powerful winter storm raked Lake Superior that night. At 11:00 pm the nightwatch pilothouse crew of the passenger steamer \"Huronic\", also upbound on the lake, reported seeing lights on a ship they passed in the storm which they believed were in the pattern of those of the \"Bannockburn\". However, no signals of distress were observed, and the two ships passed each other without incident.\n\nThe \"Bannockburn\" was reported overdue the following morning at the Soo Locks, but given the weather the previous night, this was not considered unusual. When she still did not report several days later, however, the fear that she had been lost began to grow.\n\nOn November 25 the steamer \"John D. Rockefeller\" passed through a field of floating debris near Stannard Rock Light which might have been that of the \"Bannockburn\", though at this time the \"Bannockburn\" had not yet been reported lost and the crew of the \"Rockefeller\" did not know what might have caused the debris field. By November 30, the ship and crew were officially given up as \"lost\".\n\nBy November 26, under pressure from the increasingly distressed families of the crew, a Mr. L.L. Henderson, a manager of the Montreal Transportation Company, claimed he had received a wire from the Chicago office of the underwriter's association which was providing insurance coverage for the ship. He told a local newspaper, \"The Fort Williams Times Journal\", that the message read: \"The steamer Bannockburn Has been located on the north shore of Lake Superior opposite Michipicoten Island. Crew safe.\" He later admitted he had no positive information as to her whereabouts but had based his hopeful assertion on news he had heard from the \"Germanic\", another freighter, that she had been seen safely anchored there.\n\nEventually the underwriters came to the conclusion that the \"Bannockburn\" had stranded on Caribou Island. This island is surrounded by a dangerous reef, and its lighthouse had been intentionally turned off on November 15. If the captain of the \"Bannockburn\" had been hoping to spot its warning light in the darkness of the storm on the 21st, the only evidence he would have had of his closing proximity would have been the shock of the hull striking the reef itself.\n\nOn Friday, December 12, the Captain of the Grand Marais Lifesaving Station found a cork life preserver from the \"Bannockburn\" washed up on the beach. This item is the only known wreckage from the ship ever to have been recovered.\n\nCaptain Wood, from Port Dalhousie, Ontario, was the oldest person aboard the vessel, at age 37. Most of the crew were between the ages of 17 and 20. His first mate, Alex Graham, was also from Port Dalhousie, Ontario. One of the ship's two wheelsmen, Arthur Callaghan, was only 16. Although the ship was considered to be of recent manufacture (at nine years old it was still thought of as almost new) the overall inexperience of her crew might have been a factor in her being lost. Such young crews, however, were common on the Great Lakes at the turn of the 20th century because they were inexpensive to hire and shipping firms had strong financial incentives and no legislative reason not to take advantage of this whenever they might, even in Canada.\n\nThere are many theories as to what went wrong. Captain McMaugh proposed that the ship might have experienced a boiler explosion though he did not hear one and no charred wreckage typical of such an explosion was later found anywhere along the route that the \"Bannockburn\" was known to have taken. Alternatively, the at-that-time uncharted danger of the Superior Shoal might also have been the cause.\nWhen the Soo locks were drained at the end of that season, a hull plate from a ship was found in the lock. It was supposed to have belonged to the \"Bannockburn\", and without it her hull would have had an unknown weak point.\n\nThe only known memorial to the \"Bannockburn\" is a stone tablet in a church in Port Dalhousie, Ontario. It is in memory of her captain, and was purchased by his brother.\n"}
{"id": "56140567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56140567", "title": "SS Jane Miller", "text": "SS Jane Miller\n\nSS \"Jane Miller\" was a Cargo Ship that sank with the loss of 28 lives near Wiarton, Ontario on Georgian Bay on November 25, 1881. Her wreck was discovered in 2017 resting upright in over of water.\n\nThe \"Jane Miller\" was built in 1879 for James Miller & Sons, and was used as a small freighter along the Bruce Peninsula and North Channel of Georgian Bay. In September 1879 she collided with the schooner \"Mountaineer\" at night on Owen Sound, badly damaging the schooner. It was sold to Andrew Port in June 1880 to be used in general freight service along the south shore of Georgian Bay, the east side of the Bruce Peninsula, and Manitoulin Island.\n\nOn the afternoon of November 25, 1881, the \"Jane Miller\" departed Owen Sound with a load of cargo. She arrived in Meaford, where thirty additional tons of cargo was loaded, much of which was stored on deck. The \"Jane Miller\" departed Meaford in the late afternoon headed for Spencer's Wharf near Wiarton as a blizzard began to blow with winds from the southwest. The strong winds and rough seas required a stop en route at Big Bay for additional cordwood for fuel. Departing Big Bay between 8 and 9 PM, eyewitnesses saw the \"Jane Miller\" pass White Cloud Island and enter Colpoys Bay. As she approached Spencer's Wharf, the blizzard intensified for a few minutes, and when the snow abated the \"Jane Miller\" had vanished without a trace.\n\nThe \"Jane Miller\" had little to no permanent ballast on board, instead relying on the weight of her fuel and cargo in her hold to keep her properly trimmed. It was speculated that the blizzard had resulted in the \"Jane Miller\" consuming more of her fuel than expected, and that combined with the extra cargo loaded at Meaford, had become top heavy. When the snowstorm increased in intensity in Colpoys Bay, a strong gust of wind flipped her on her side, and she sank in minutes.\n\nOn December 4th three men started rowing from near Spencer's wharf towards White Cloud Island to see if they could find any indication of the missing ship. Half a mile northeast of Spencer's wharf they discovered a patch of discoloured water with air bubbles rising to the surface. Bearings from certain objects on the shore were made, and the position was later determined to be very close to the last observed location of the \"Jane Miller\". Continuing on to White Cloud Island they found in a bay several items, including \"oars, some pins of the lifeboat, a piece of a mast, and a steamers gang plank\".. The tugboat \"Tommy Wright\" dragged the area hoping to find the wreck, but was unsuccessful as soundings revealed depths greater than 33 fathoms (198 feet or 60.35 metres) in the area. \n\nA historical plaque was erected near Spencer's Wharf to commemorate the sinking.\n\nThere were an additional ten passengers whose names were not recorded, bound for Lion Head or Tobermory to work as labourers over the winter.\n\nThe wreck of the \"Jane Miller\" was discovered on July 27, 2017 by a shipwreck hunting team made up of Jared Daniel, Jerry Eliason and Ken Merryman operating with a permit issued by the Ontario Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport. The discovery was announced on November 25, 2017, the 136th anniversary of the sinking. The wreck is upright, in over 100 ft of water. The pilothouse, smokestack, and upper deck cabins have collapsed, but the hull is mostly intact, and the mast and three lifeboat davits are still in place. The permit did not allow for the divers to enter, but Daniel reported seeing sixteen corpses inside the hull. Merryman admitted that he was unsure if they had seen any human remains, since the wreck is heavily encrusted with zebra mussels, making identification of any such remains very difficult. A subsequent investigation of the wreck by divers from the Ontario Provincial Police and Canadian Forces did not find any human remains. Despite this, the wreck of the \"Jane Miller\" has been designated a protected archaeological site under the Ontario Heritage Act, and Merryman has not released the exact position and depth of the wreck, in order to further protect the site. \n\n"}
{"id": "7023870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7023870", "title": "Sex strike", "text": "Sex strike\n\nA sex strike, sometimes called a sex boycott, is a strike, a method of non-violent resistance in which one or multiple persons (usually women) refrain from sex with their partners to achieve certain goals. It is a form of temporary sexual abstinence.\n\nSex strikes have been used to protest many issues, from war to gang violence.\n\nThe most famous example of a sex strike in the arts is the Greek playwright Aristophanes' work \"Lysistrata\", an anti-war comedy. The female characters in the play, led by the eponymous Lysistrata, withhold sex from their husbands as part of their strategy to secure peace and end the Peloponnesian War.\n\nAmong the Igbo people of Nigeria, in pre-colonial times, the community of women periodically formed themselves into a Council, a kind of women's trade union. This was headed by the Agba Ekwe, 'the favoured one of the goddess Idemili and her earthly manifestation'. She carried her staff of authority and had the final word in public gatherings and assemblies. Central among her tasks was to ensure men's good behaviour, punishing male attempts at harassment or abuse. What men most feared was the Council's power of strike action. According to Ifi Amadiume, an Igbo anthropologist: \"The strongest weapon the Council had and used against the men was the right to order mass strikes and demonstrations by all women. When ordered to strike, women refused to perform their expected duties and roles, including all domestic, sexual and maternal services. They would leave the town \"en masse\", carrying only suckling babies. If angry enough, they were known to attack any men they met.\"\n\nCiting similar examples of women's strike action in hunter-gatherer and other precolonial traditions around the world, some anthropologists argue that it was thanks to solidarity of this kind—especially collective resistance to the possibility of rape—that language, culture, and religion became established in our species in the first instance. This controversial hypothesis is known as the \"Female Cosmetic Coalitions\", \"Lysistrata\", or \"sex strike\" theory of human origins.\n\nIn October 1997, the chief of the Military of Colombia, General Manuel Bonnet publicly called for a sex strike among the wives and girlfriends of the Colombian left-wing guerrillas, drug traffickers, and paramilitaries as part of a strategy—along with diplomacy—to achieve a ceasefire. Also the mayor of Bogota, Antanas Mockus, declared the capital a women-only zone for one night, suggesting men to stay at home to reflect on violence. The guerrillas ridiculed the initiatives, pointing at the fact that there were more than 2,000 women in their army. In the end the ceasefire was achieved, but lasted only a short time.\n\nIn September 2006 dozens of wives and girlfriends of gang members from Pereira, Colombia, started a sex strike called \"La huelga de las piernas cruzadas\" (\"the strike of crossed legs\") to curb gang violence, in response to 480 deaths due to gang violence in the coffee region. According to spokeswoman Jennifer Bayer, the specific target of the strike was to force gang members to turn in their weapons in compliance with the law. According to them, many gang members were involved in violent crime for status and sexual attractiveness, and the strike sent the message that refusing to turn in the guns was not sexy. In 2010 the city's murder rate saw the steepest decline in Colombia, down by 26.5%.\n\nIn June 2011, women organized in the so-called Crossed Legs Movement in the secluded town of Barbacoas in southwestern Colombia, started a sex strike to pressure the government to repair the road connecting Barbacoas and its neighboring towns and cities. They declared that if the men of the town were not going to demand action, they would refuse to have sex with them. The men of Barbacoas showed no support at the beginning of the campaign, but they soon joined in the protest campaign. After 112 days strike in October 2011, the Colombian government promised action on road repairs, and construction ensued.\n\nIn April 2009 a group of Kenyan women organised a week-long sex strike aimed at politicians, encouraging the wives of the president and prime minister to join in too, and offering to pay prostitutes for lost earnings if they joined in.\n\nIn 2003 Leymah Gbowee and the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace organized nonviolence protests that included a sex strike. Their actions led to peace in Liberia after a 14‑year civil war and the election of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, country's first female head of state. Leymah Gbowee was awarded the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize \"for her non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights to full participation in peace-building work.\"\n\nIn the build-up to New Year's Eve in 2008, hundreds of Neapolitan women pledged to make their husbands and lovers \"sleep on the sofa\" unless they took action to prevent fireworks from causing serious injuries.\n\nDuring the summer of 2011, women in rural Mindanao imposed a several-week-long sex strike in an attempt to end fighting between their two villages.\n\nIn October 2014, Pricilla Nanyang, a politician in South Sudan, coordinated a meeting of women peace activists in Juba \"to advance the cause of peace, healing and reconciliation.\" Attendees issued a statement which called on women of South Sudan \"to deny their husbands conjugal rights until they ensure that peace returns.\"\n\nIn 2012, inspired by the 2003 Liberian sex strike, the Togolese opposition coalition \"Let's Save Togo\" asked women to abstain from sex for a week as a protest against President Faure Gnassingbé, whose family has been in power for more than 45 years. The strike aimed to \"motivate men who are not involved in the political movement to pursue its goals\". Opposition leader Isabelle Ameganvi views it as a possible \"weapon of the battle\" to achieve political change.\n\n\n\n• The Lysistrata project\n"}

The medieval torture chamber was windowless and often built underground, was lit by a few candles and was specifically designed to induce \"horror, dread and despair\" to anyone but those possessing a strong mind and \"nerves of steel\".\n\nHistorically, torture chambers were located in royal palaces, in castles of the nobility and even buildings belonging to the church. They featured secret trap-doors which could be activated to throw victims into dark dungeons where they remained and eventually died. The skeletal remains of people who disappeared were strewn on the floor of the hidden dungeons. Other times the dungeons under the trap-doors included pits of water where the victim was thrown to drown after a lengthy torture session in the chamber above.\n\nIn Peru, the torture chambers of the Inquisition were specifically constructed with thick walls so that the screams of the victims could not penetrate them and no sound could be heard from the outside. Other more sophisticated designs used principles of acoustics to muffle the screams of the tortured and included walls which recessed and protruded in such a fashion as to reflect the screams of the victims so that the sounds would not be carried to the exterior.\n\nThe mere presence of the torture chamber was used as a form of intimidation and coercion. The victims were first shown the chamber and if they confessed they would not be tortured inside it. Other times the torture chamber was used as the final destination in a series of prison cells where the victims would gradually be moved from one type of cell to another, under progressively worsening conditions of incarceration, and if they did not recant in the earlier stages they would finally reach the torture chamber. The final stage of actually going to the torture chamber itself, just prior to the initiation of torture, was euphemistically called the \"Question\".\n\nThroughout history torture chambers have been used in a multiplicity of ways starting from Roman times. Torture chamber use during the Middle Ages was frequent. Religious, social and political persecution led to the widespread use of torture during that time. Torture chambers were also used during the Spanish Inquisition and at the Tower of London.\n\nAnother example of a torture chamber, not known by many, is \"The Thieves Tower\" in the Alsace region of France. Once a tower used for torture, it is now a small museum displaying instruments used upon the prisoners to get them to confess crimes.\n\nIn Venice, the Palazzo Ducale had its own torture chamber, which was deemed to be of such importance that renovations started in 1507 so that the chamber walls could be kept strong and secure: \"considerata la grandissima importantia de j cameroti di la Camera del tormento che siano forti e securi\".\n\nAccording to the narrations of Ashokavadana, King Ashoka, prior to his conversion to Buddhism, was a fierce and sadistic ruler, known as \"Ashoka the Fierce\", who built a palatial torture chamber known as \"Ashoka's Hell\". The legend of the torture palace is detailed in the writings of the Ashokavadana.\n\nAccording to Ashokavadana, Ashoka asked Girika, who was the official executioner of his kingdom, to design an elaborate torture chamber disguised as a beautiful and \"enticing\" palace adorned with all kinds of decorations and full of amenities such as exclusive baths decorated with flowers, fruit trees and many ornaments. It was artfully designed to make people long to just look at it.\n\nAccording to legend, beneath the veneer of beauty deep inside the exclusive mansion, torture chambers were constructed which were full of the most sadistic and cruel instruments of torture including furnaces producing molten metal.\n\nAccording to the accounts contained in the Ashokavadana, Girika, the architect of the chamber, was inspired by descriptions of the five tortures of the Buddhist hell for the design of the torture chamber and of the torture methods he inflicted upon his victims. The torture chamber was so terrifying, that King Ashoka himself was thought to have visited hell so that he could perfect its evil design.\n\nAshoka made Girika promise that he would never allow anyone who entered the palace to exit alive, including Ashoka himself. In the \"Biographical Sutra of King Ashoka\" the palace is described by the sentence: 'King Ashoka constructed a hell'.\n\nSometime later a Buddhist monk by the name of Samudra happened to visit the palace and upon entering he was informed by Girika that he would be tortured to death, and was subsequently led into the torture chamber. His torturers however failed to injure him and he appeared able to neutralise their torture methods by performing miracles.\n\nAshoka converted to Buddhism when he witnessed Samudra's miracles inside the torture chamber. He also ordered Girika burnt alive and ordered the demolition of the torture palace. According to the Ashokavadana, \"the beautiful jail was then torn down and a guarantee of security was extended to all beings\".\n\nXuanzang in his writings mentions that in the 7th century AD he had visited the place where Ashoka's Hell once was. In India the palace is known as \"Ashoka's Hell\" and its location near Pataliputra became a popular destination for pilgrims. Faxian also reports visiting it and his account of the story of the palace differs slightly from that of Xuanzang's.\n\nAccording to Frederick Howard Wines in his book \"Punishment and Reformation: A Study Of The Penitentiary System\" there were three main types of coercion employed in the torture chamber: Coercion by the cord, by water and by fire. There were five stages of torture that could have been applied to the accused: he could have been threatened with torture, he could have been taken to the torture chamber and been shown the instruments, he could have been undressed as if in preparation to be tied to the instrument, without actually being tied, he could have been tied to the instrument of torture but not actually getting tortured and finally he could have been tied to the instrument and tortured.\n\nThe process of being tied and led to the torture rack inside the torture chamber was a form of intimidation and was called \"territio realis\" as opposed to \"territio verbalis oder lexis\" which was the verbal threat of torture being made at the judgment hall. \"Territio realis\" as well as the actual torture session were called \"examen rigorosum\".\n\nIn the book \"Crime and criminal justice in Europe and Canada\" it is mentioned that fear was a factor in the process of torture and that there was a form of torture known as \"La présentation de la question\" or simply the \"Question\", where the prisoner was led to the torture chamber and was shown the implements of torture. While at the chamber, sentence to full torture was pronounced but, immediately after, the prisoner was taken back to the prison cell, without actually having been tortured.\n\nThe torture chamber was specifically designed to evoke fear in the victims. It was usually built underground and only dimly lit. Inside the chamber waited the executioner, his face completely covered apart from two holes in the garment to enable him to peer through and wearing a black hood; his menacing appearance being described as \"most diabolical\" and \"satanic\".\n\nWhen during the Question, the view of the chamber, the torture implements and the executioner did not cause the victim to confess, a full-scale torture session was planned. To prepare for torture, the victim was stripped naked with hands tied. The penultimate step to torture included a repetition of the questions asked earlier of the victims. If the victims still proclaimed their innocence, full torture was initiated.\n\nThe most common instrument of torture was the \"strappado\", which was a simple rope and pulley system. With the pulley attached to ceiling of the chamber, the lifting rope was tied to the wrist of the victim, whose hands were tied behind their back. Subsequently, the victim was raised to the ceiling and then lowered using a jerking motion causing dislocation of the shoulder joints. To increase the suffering caused by the strappado, weights were attached to the feet of the victim.\n\nChurch doctrine protected human life so it was problematic if a victim were to die, especially before they confessed. In difficult cases, when a victim would not readily confess or was too weak to continue in an uninterrupted torture session, breaks were allowed between torture sessions because Inquisition regulations only allowed one torture session per victim. That way, a torture session could resume after a break to allow time for the victim to recover or reconsider their opposition to confessing, and it was considered to have been the continuation of the previous torture session and not a new one.\n\nBecause confession under torture was not acceptable, the victim had to sign a written confession after they had made their oral confession under torture. Typically, during confession, the inquisitors demanded that the prisoner implicate as many people as possible and not only themselves. If the prisoner resisted signing, the inquisitors could always resume the torture by claiming that they had just halted the session, just for the signing, but did not really put an end to it.\n\nThe method of construction of the torture chamber of the papal palace at Avignon, used during the Inquisition, has been described as ingenious. The construction of some of the torture chambers at Avignon was based on principles of Acoustics, specifically designed to muffle the screams and cries of the tortured. The walls of the torture chamber recessed and protruded in a complementary fashion to the walls on the opposite side so as to reflect the screams of the victims locally, ensuring that their shrieks would not be carried to the exterior. A chamber located above the main torture chamber had a dungeon with a hole near the middle of the floor through which, according to accounts, the tortured bodies of the prisoners were thrown into a cavity. The chamber where the victims were being burnt was of circular construction and resembled the furnace of a glass-house with a funnel-like chimney at the top.\n\nThere were secret staircases and hidden spaces which were used to overhear the discussions in the prison cells. The ceiling of the torture chamber was especially designed to muffle the cries of the victims. Inside the torture chamber, furnaces and grates were also present. Up to 1850 the chambers were shown to visitors after which time the ecclesiastical authorities of Avignon decided to shut them down. In a similar vein the torture chamber of the Spanish Inquisition in Lima, Peru had one metre thick walls so that the screams of the victims could not penetrate them.\n\nIn Nuremberg and Salzburg the torture chambers featured trapdoors on their floors. In Nuremberg the room underneath the main torture chamber featured torture machinery while in Salzburg, the room under the trapdoor, functioned like a waiting room for prisoners. When the time came the prisoner was pulled up and into the upper torture chamber. Other times, deep water pits could be found under the trapdoor, where the victims of the torture chamber could be thrown, after a torture session, to drown.\n\nThe torture chamber was the final destination in a progression of four cell types during incarceration at the Palace of the Inquisition. The palace contained the Judgement Hall, the offices of the employees, the private apartments of the Grand Inquisitor and the detention cells adjacent to the apartments. The detention cell gradations started with the \"cells of mercy\" reserved mainly for rich transgressors who upon bequeathing all their property to the Inquisition were normally let go after a time of detention in the cells.\n\nFor more difficult prisoners the next cell stage was the \"cell of penitence\". These were situated in small round towers of about 3 metres (ten feet) in diameter. They were painted white and included rudimentary furniture such as a stool and a bed. Very little light was allowed in. If the prisoner did not cooperate, the next step in the detention process was the dungeon. The dungeon had walls 1.5 metres (five feet) thick, double doors and was in complete darkness. No conversation of any type was allowed in the dungeon. The food allowance for prisoners was less than a penny a day including the profit of the warden while any human refuse was removed every four days. After a stay in the dungeon, uncooperative prisoners were moved to their final destination: the torture chamber.\n\nThe Palace of Inquisition was a torture chamber in Cartagena, Colombia, built under orders of Philip III, which served as headquarters for the Spanish Inquisition. It was used to torture Jews, and other non-Catholics. Approximately 800 individuals were put to death there.\n\nThe traditional torture users of modern times have been dictatorship governments e.g. the Nazis, Argentine military junta (at the Navy School of Mechanics), and the Chilean dictatorship led by Augusto Pinochet as well as other South American regimes. The isolation felt inside the Nazi torture chambers was so strong that author, and victim, K. Zetnik, during his testimony at the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem in 1961, has described them as \"another galaxy.\"\n\nIn Chile, during the Pinochet dictatorship, the use of converted locker-rooms and skyboxes as torture chambers has been reported. The \"Esmeralda\", a training ship of the Chilean Navy had also been used as a \"floating torture chamber\" during Pinochet's dictatorship. In 2011, protests erupted in Vancouver, Canada, upon a visit by the \"Esmeralda\". In Santiago, Chile, \"Villa Grimaldi\", once a cultural center, was used as a torture centre which included torture chambers. A tour of \"Villa Grimaldi\" has been described as a \"tour of barbarity\" featuring exhibits with descriptive signs such as \"Place of hangings\", \"Torture chamber\", \"Annex torture chamber\", \"Women's cells 1x1 meter\", \"The Grill: Electric Beds\" and others.\n\nMichelle Bachelet, who later became President of Chile, was tortured in a torture chamber during the Pinochet years. After the fall of Pinochet, the torture chamber victims and the relatives of the \"desaparecidos\" refused to strike a deal with Pinochet or with the politicians that followed him.\n\nUse of torture chambers was also reported in Europe during the Greek military junta years (1967–1974). Alexandros Panagoulis and Army Major Spyros Moustaklis are examples of persons tortured at the EAT/ESA (Greek Military Police) interrogation cell units.\n\nUnder his reign (16 July 1979 until 9 April 2003), Saddam Hussein reportedly tortured those whom he deemed as a threat. After the invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces, pictures of dead Iraqis, with their necks slashed, their eyes gouged out and their genitals blackened, were located in many torture chambers. Jail cells, with dried blood on the floor and rusted shackles bolted to the walls, lined the corridors.\n\nIn November 2004, U.S. Marines found a number of torture rooms in Fallujah by following trails of dried blood, or the smell of dead bodies. Some rooms were hidden behind fake walls, or concealed in basements. \nLibyans have entered abandoned torture chambers and found devices that have been used against opposition members in the past.\n\nSince the 1970s, the Chicago Police Department has tortured prisoners at Homan Square to extract forced confessions. In addition, the CIA tortures prisoners at Black Sites around the world \n\nAside from its dictionary definition the term has great cultural resonance, because it transforms an abstract concept (torture) into a real place (torture chamber), and is an integral part of pop culture. Related exhibits can also be found in torture museums and in exhibits in places such as Las Vegas and Niagara Falls, which attract millions of tourists each year.\n\nIn film the torture chamber is also known as the chamber of horrors, with the word \"horror\" implying \"torture\" as well as \"murder\", or a combination of both. Classic films focusing on the torture chamber include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Until recently, the body was also called the \"Windeby Girl\", since an archeologist believed it to be the body of a 14-year-old girl, because of its slight build. Prof. Heather Gill-Robinson, a Canadian anthropologist and pathologist, used DNA testing to show the body was actually that of a sixteen-year-old boy. The body has been radiocarbon-dated to between 41 BCE and 118 CE. \n\nThe body was discovered by commercial peat cutters in 1952, and is now on display at The Landesmuseum at the Schloß Gottorf in Schleswig, Germany. Unfortunately, by the time the body was noticed by the peat cutters, and before the peat-cutting machinery could be shut down, a hand, a foot, and a leg had been severed from the body. The body had been very well preserved by the peat, and despite this damage it is still an important archaeological discovery. Shortly after the discovery of Windeby I, another bog body (an adult male) was found nearby and dubbed Windeby II.\n\nThe body appears to have a half-shaven head and a woollen blindfold tied across the eyes. Recent examinations have however established that the hair over the half of the scalp was not shaven, but had rather decomposed due to being exposed to oxygen a little longer than the rest of the body. The \"blindfold\" is in fact a woollen band, made using the sprang technique, that was probably used to tie back the boy’s shoulder-length hair and which had slipped down over his face after death. Evidence from the body suggests that the boy had been killed, possibly as a sacrifice or a punishment. This idea is supported by the observation that the body was discovered beneath rocks and branches, which were presumably used to hold the body down.\n\n\n\n\n"}
