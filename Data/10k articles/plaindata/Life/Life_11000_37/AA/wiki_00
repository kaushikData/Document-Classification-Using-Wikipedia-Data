{"id": "192481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192481", "title": "50 Cent", "text": "50 Cent\n\nCurtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975), known professionally as 50 Cent, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, actor, television producer, entrepreneur, and investor. Born in the South Jamaica neighborhood of the borough of Queens, Jackson began selling drugs at age twelve during the 1980s crack epidemic. He later began pursuing a musical career and in 2000 he produced \"Power of the Dollar\" for Columbia Records, but days before the planned release he was shot and the album was never released. In 2002, after Jackson released the compilation album \"Guess Who's Back?\", he was discovered by Eminem and signed to Shady Records, under the aegis of Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records.\n\nWith the aid of Eminem and Dr. Dre (who produced his first major-label album, \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\"), Jackson became one of the world's best selling rappers and rose to prominence with East Coast hip hop group G-Unit (which he leads \"de facto\"). In 2003, he founded G-Unit Records, signing his G-Unit associates Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. Jackson had similar commercial and critical success with his second album, \"The Massacre\", which was released in 2005. He released his fifth studio album, \"Animal Ambition\", in 2014 and is working on his sixth studio album, \"Street King Immortal\". He executive produces and stars in the show \"Power\", which airs on Starz.\n\nDuring his career Jackson has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and won several awards, including a Grammy Award, thirteen Billboard Music Awards, six World Music Awards, three American Music Awards and four BET Awards. He has pursued an acting career, appearing in the semi-autobiographical film \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" (2005), the Iraq War film \"Home of the Brave\" (2006) and \"Righteous Kill\" (2008). 50 Cent was ranked the sixth-best artist of the 2000s and the third-best rapper (behind Eminem and Nelly) by Billboard. \"Rolling Stone\" consider \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" and \"In da Club\" to be in their lists of \"100 Best albums of the 2000s\" and \"100 Best songs of the 2000s\" at numbers 37 and 13 respectively.\n\nJackson was born in the borough of Queens, New York City, and raised in its South Jamaica neighborhood by his mother, Sabrina. A drug dealer, Sabrina raised Jackson until she died in a mysterious fire when Jackson was 8. After his mother's death and his father's departure Jackson was raised by his grandmother.\n\nHe began boxing at about age 11, and when he was 14 a neighbor opened a boxing gym for local youth. \"When I wasn't killing time in school, I was sparring in the gym or selling crack on the strip,\" Jackson remembered. \"I was competitive in the ring and hip-hop is competitive too ... I think rappers condition themselves like boxers, so they all kind of feel like they're the champ.\" At age 12, Jackson began dealing narcotics when his grandparents thought he was in after-school programs and brought guns and drug money to school. In the tenth grade, he was caught by metal detectors at Andrew Jackson High School: \"I was embarrassed that I got arrested like that ... After I got arrested I stopped hiding it. I was telling my grandmother [openly], 'I sell drugs.'\"\n\nOn June 29, 1994, Jackson was arrested for selling four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was arrested again three weeks later, when police searched his home and found heroin, ten ounces of crack cocaine and a starting pistol. Although Jackson was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, he served six months in a boot camp and earned his GED. He has said that he did not use cocaine himself. Jackson adopted the nickname \"50 Cent\" as a metaphor for change. The name was inspired by Kelvin Martin, a 1980s Brooklyn robber known as \"50 Cent\"; Jackson chose it \"because it says everything I want it to say. I'm the same kind of person 50 Cent was. I provide for myself by any means.\"\n\nJackson began rapping in a friend's basement, where he used turntables to record over instrumentals. In 1996 a friend introduced him to Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC, who was establishing Jam Master Jay Records. Jay taught him how to count bars, write choruses, structure songs and make records. Jackson's first appearance was on \"React\" with Onyx, for their 1998 album \"Shut 'Em Down\". He credited Jam Master Jay for improving his ability to write hooks, and Jay produced Jackson's first (unreleased) album. In 1999, after Jackson left Jam Master Jay, the platinum-selling producers Trackmasters signed him to Columbia Records. They sent him to an upstate New York studio, where he produced thirty-six songs in two weeks; eighteen were included on his 2000 album, \"Power of the Dollar\". Jackson founded Hollow Point Entertainment with former G-Unit member Bang 'Em Smurf.\n\nJackson's popularity began to grow after the successful, controversial underground single \"How to Rob\", which he wrote in a half-hour car ride to a studio. The track comically describes how he would rob famous artists. Jackson explained the song's rationale: \"There's a hundred artists on that label, you gotta separate yourself from that group and make yourself relevant\". Rappers Jay-Z, Kurupt, Sticky Fingaz, Big Pun, DMX, Wyclef Jean and the Wu-Tang Clan responded to the track, and Nas invited Jackson to join him on his \"Nastradamus\" tour. Although \"How to Rob\" was intended to be released with \"Thug Love\" (with Destiny's Child), two days before he was scheduled to film the \"Thug Love\" music video Jackson was shot and hospitalized.\n\nOn May 24, 2000, Jackson was attacked by a gunman outside his grandmother's former home in South Jamaica. After getting into a friend's car, he was asked to return to the house to get some jewelry; his son was in the house, and his grandmother was in the front yard. After Jackson returned to the back seat of the car, another car pulled up nearby; an assailant walked up and fired nine shots at close range with a 9mm handgun. Jackson was shot in the hand, arm, hip, both legs, chest and left cheek. His facial wound resulted in a swollen tongue, the loss of a wisdom tooth and a slightly slurred voice; his friend was wounded in the hand. They were driven to a hospital, where Jackson spent thirteen days. The alleged attacker, Darryl Baum, Mike Tyson's close friend and bodyguard, was killed three weeks later.\n\nJackson recalled the shooting: \"It happens so fast that you don't even get a chance to shoot back ... I was scared the whole time ... I was looking in the rear-view mirror like, 'Oh shit, somebody shot me in the face! It burns, burns, burns.'\" In his autobiography, \"From Pieces to Weight: Once upon a Time in Southside Queens\", he wrote: \"After I got shot nine times at close range and didn't die, I started to think that I must have a purpose in life ... How much more damage could that shell have done? Give me an inch in this direction or that one, and I'm gone\". After using a walker for six weeks, Jackson was fully recovered after five months. When he left the hospital he stayed in the Poconos with his girlfriend and son, and his workout regime helped him develop a muscular physique.\n\nIn the hospital Jackson signed a publishing deal with Columbia Records before he was dropped from the label and blacklisted by the recording industry because of his song, \"Ghetto Qu'ran\". Unable to work in a U.S. studio, he went to Canada. With business partner Sha Money XL, Jackson recorded over thirty songs for mixtapes to build a reputation. In a HitQuarters interview, Marc Labelle of Shady Records A&R said that Jackson used the mixtape circuit to his advantage: \"He took all the hottest beats from every artist and flipped them with better hooks. They then got into all the markets on the mixtapes and all the mixtape DJs were messing with them.\" Jackson's popularity increased, and in 2002 he released the mixtape \"Guess Who's Back?\". He then released \"50 Cent Is the Future\" backed by G-Unit, a mixtape revisiting material by Jay-Z and Raphael Saadiq.\n\nIn 2002, Eminem heard Jackson's \"Guess Who's Back?\" CD, received from Jackson's attorney (who was working with Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg). Impressed, Eminem invited Jackson to fly to Los Angeles and introduced him to Dr. Dre. After signing a $1 million record deal, Jackson released \"No Mercy, No Fear\". The mixtape featured one new track, \"Wanksta\", which appeared on Eminem's \"8 Mile\" soundtrack. Jackson was also signed by Chris Lighty's Violator Management and Sha Money XL's Money Management Group.\n\nJackson released his debut album, \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" (described by AllMusic as \"probably the most hyped debut album by a rap artist in about a decade\"), in February 2003. \"Rolling Stone\" noted its \"dark synth grooves, buzzy keyboards and a persistently funky bounce\", with Jackson complementing the production in \"an unflappable, laid-back flow\". It debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 872,000 copies in its first four days. The lead single, \"In da Club\" (noted by \"The Source\" for its \"blaring horns, funky organs, guitar riffs and sparse hand claps\"), set a \"Billboard\" record as the most listened-to song in radio history within a week.\nInterscope gave Jackson his own label, G-Unit Records, in 2003. He signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck as members of G-Unit, and The Game was later signed in a joint venture with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment. In March 2005 Jackson's second commercial album, \"The Massacre\", sold 1.14 million copies in its first four days (the highest in an abbreviated sales cycle) and was number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 for six weeks. He was the first solo artist with three singles in the \"Billboard\" top five in the same week with \"Candy Shop\", \"Disco Inferno\" and \"How We Do\". According to \"Rolling Stone\", \"50's secret weapon is his singing voice - the deceptively amateur-sounding tenor croon that he deploys on almost every chorus\".\n\nAfter The Game's departure Jackson signed Olivia and rap veterans Mobb Deep to G-Unit Records, with Spider Loc, M.O.P., 40 Glocc and Young Hot Rod later joining the label, who all eventually departed the label. Jackson expressed an interest in working with rappers other than G-Unit, such as Lil' Scrappy of BME, LL Cool J of Def Jam, Mase of Bad Boy and Freeway of Roc-A-Fella, and recorded with several.\n\nIn September 2007 Jackson released his third album, \"Curtis\", which was inspired by his life before \"Get Rich or Die Tryin\". It debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 691,000 copies during its first week (behind Kanye West's \"Graduation\", released the same day). On the September 10, 2008 episode of \"Total Request Live\" Jackson said his fourth studio album, \"Before I Self Destruct\", would be \"done and released in November\". He released \"Ok, You're Right\", produced by Dr. Dre for \"Before I Self Destruct\", on May 18, 2009 and was scheduled to appear in a fall 2009 episode of VH1's \"Behind the Music\". On September 3, 2009 Jackson posted a video for the Soundkillers' Phoenix- produced track, \"Flight 187\", introducing his mixtape and book (\"The 50th Law\"). The song, with lyrics inspiring speculation about tension between Jackson and Jay-Z, was a bonus track on the iTunes version of \"Before I Self Destruct\". \"Before I Self Destruct\" was released on November 9, 2009.\n\nIn a Contactmusic.com interview Jackson said he was working on a Eurodance album, \"Black Magic\", inspired by European nightclubs: \"First they played hip-hop which suddenly changed to uptempo songs, known as Eurodance\". He later said he had changed his next album to \"The Return of the Heartless Monster\" after writing different material when he returned home from the Invitation Tour in 2010, shelving \"Black Magic\". On September 3, Jackson supported Eminem on his and Jay-Z's The Home & Home Tour, performing \"Crack A Bottle\" with Eminem and Dr. Dre amid rumors of tension between Jackson and Dre.\n\nHe \"recorded 20 songs to a whole different album concept\" before putting them aside, wanting his new album to have the \"aggression\" of \"Get Rich or Die Tryin\". Jackson tweeted that the album was \"80 percent done\" and fans could expect it in the summer of 2011. It was ultimately delayed a year due to disagreements with Interscope Records, with Jackson saying that he would release it in November 2011 with a different title than \"Black Magic\". Eminem would appear on the album, and Jackson said he was working with new producers such as Boi-1da and Alex da Kid. Cardiak, who produced Lloyd Banks' \"Start It Up\", confirmed that he produced a song for the upcoming album.\n\nJackson released a song, \"Outlaw\", from his fifth album on the Internet on June 1,6 2011. The single, produced by Cardiak, was released on iTunes on July 19 (although Jackson tweeted that it was not the album's first single). The rapper planned to write a semi-autobiographical young-adult novel about bullying, different from his previous books which focused on his life and the rules of power. According to the book's publisher, the first-person novel (about a 13-year-old schoolyard bully \"who finds redemption as he faces what he's done\") was scheduled for publication in January 2012.\n\nIn a series of tweets Jackson told that the delay of his fifth album was due to disagreements with Interscope Records, later suggesting that it would be released in November 2011 with his headphone line (SMS by 50). He speculated to MTV News about not renewing his five-album contract with Interscope: \"I don't know ... It will all be clear in the negotiations following me turning this actual album in. And, of course, the performance and how they actually treat the work will determine whether you still want to stay in that position or not.\"\n\nOn June 20, 2011, Jackson announced the release of \"Before I Self Destruct II\" after his fifth album. Although he planned to shoot a music video for the fifth album's lead single, \"I'm On It\", on June 26 the video was never filmed. Jackson told Shade45, \"I did four songs in Detroit with Eminem. I did two with Just Blaze, a Boi-1da joint, and I did something with Alex da Kid. We made two that are definite singles and the other two are the kinds of records that we been making, more aimed at my core audience, more aggressive, more of a different kind of energy to it.\" He released \"Street King Energy Track #7\" in September 2011 to promote Street King, his charity-based energy drink. An announcement that Jackson was shooting a music video for \"Girls Go Wild\", the fifth-album lead single featuring Jeremih, was made on September 28, 2011.\n\nJackson's fifth album, \"Street King Immortal\", was initially scheduled for a summer 2012 release and postponed until November 13. Disagreements with Interscope Records about its release and promotion led to its temporary cancellation. Its first promo single, \"New Day\" with Dr. Dre and Alicia Keys, was released on July 27. The song was produced by Dr. Dre, mixed by Eminem and written by 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Royce da 5'9\" and Dr. Dre. A solo version by Keys was leaked by her husband, Swizz Beatz. \"My Life\", the album's second promo single (with Eminem and Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine), was released on November 26, 2012.\n\nIn January 2014, Jackson said he planned to release \"Animal Ambition\" in the first quarter of the year, followed by \"Street King Immortal\". On February 20 he left Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope, signing with Caroline and Capitol Music Group. According to Jackson, although he owed Interscope another album he was released from his contract because of his friendship with Eminem and Dr. Dre: \"I'm a special case and situation. It's also because of the leverage of having the strong relationships with Eminem and Dr. Dre. They don't want me to be uncomfortable. They value our friendship to the point that they would never want [to jeopardize] it over that little bit of money.\"\n\nThat day, he announced that \"Animal Ambition\" would be released on June 3 and released its first track. The song, \"Funeral\", was released with a video on Forbes.com. Produced by Jake One, it is a continuation of \"50 Bars\" from a previous album; two more tracks were scheduled for release on March 18. At South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, Jackson performed \"Hold On\" from the new album. That song and \"Don't Worry 'Bout It\" were released with accompanying videos on March 18. According to Jackson, prosperity would be a theme of the album: \"This project, I had to search for a concept, a really good concept, in my perspective, and that was prosperity. I outlined all the things that would be a part of prosperity, positive and negative [for \"Animal Ambition\"].\"\n\nOn May 14, 2015, Jackson revealed in an interview that the first single from \"Street King Immortal\", would be previewed Memorial Day weekend and would likely be released in June. Jackson released \"Get Low\" on May 20, 2015, as the intended first single from his sixth studio album, \"Street King Immortal\" (2015). The song, produced by Remo the Hitmaker, features vocals from fellow American rappers 2 Chainz and T.I., as well as American singer Jeremih. He announced bankruptcy on July 13, 2015.\n\nOn March 31, 2017, Interscope Records released 50 Cent's final album for the label, a greatest hits album titled \"Best Of\".\n\nJackson cites Boogie Down Productions, Big Daddy Kane, The Juice Crew, EPMD and KRS-One as his rapping influences, while citing LL Cool J as an inspiration behind his writing of \"21 Questions\". Jackson also states that he drew influences from Nas, Rakim and The Notorious B.I.G. while working on \"Animal Ambition\".\n\nJackson has had a highly successful business career. He is financially invested in a highly diversified variety of industries. Jackson is now involved in artist and talent management, record, television, and film production, footwear, apparel, fragrances, liquor, video games, mobile apps, book publishing, headphones and health drinks and dietary supplements. His broad business and investment portfolio contains investments in a variety of sectors including real estate, financial market investments, mining, boxing promotion, vodka, fragrances, consumer electronics and fashion. He established his own record label G-Unit Records in 2003 following his mainstream success. In November 2003, he signed a five-year deal with Reebok to distribute a G-Unit Sneakers line for his G-Unit Clothing Company. Stating in an interview regarding his vast business empire, Jackson says his businesses have a habit of doing well as he sees all of his ventures both past and present as revolving around his alter ego. Jackson has also started a book publishing imprint, G-Unit Books on January 4, 2007 at the Time Warner Building in New York. He has written a number of books including a memoir, \"From Pieces To Weight\" in 2005 where it sold 73,000 copies in hardcover and 14,000 copies in paperback; a crime novel and a book with Robert Greene titled \"The 50th Law\", an urban take on \"The 48 Laws of Power\". In November 2011, Jackson released 50 Cent's Playground, a young adult fiction novel about a bullied, violent kid and his gay mom.\n\nOne of Jackson's first business ventures was a partnership with Glacéau to create an enhanced water drink called Formula 50. In October 2004, Jackson became a beverage investor when he was given a minority share in the company in exchange for becoming a spokesperson after learning that he was a fan of the beverage. The health conscious Jackson noted that he first learned of the product while at a gym in Los Angeles, and stated that \"they do such a good job making water taste good.\" After becoming a minority shareholder and celebrity spokesperson, Jackson worked with the company to create a new grape flavored \"Formula 50\" variant of VitaminWater and mentioned the drinks in various songs and interviews. In 2007, Coca-Cola purchased Glacéau for $4.1 billion and, according to \"Forbes\", Jackson, who was a minority shareholder, earned $100 million from the deal after taxes. Though he no longer has an equity stake in the company, Jackson continues to act as a spokesperson for Vitaminwater, enthusiastically supporting the product including singing about it at the BET Awards and expressing his excitement over the company's continuing to allow his input on products.\nHe joined Right Guard to introduce a body spray (Pure 50 RGX) and endorsed Magic Stick condoms, planning to donate part of their proceeds to increasing HIV awareness. Jackson signed a multi-year deal with Steiner Sports to sell his memorabilia, and announced plans for a dietary-supplement company in conjunction with his film \"Spectacular Regret\" in August 2007.\nJackson has founded two film production companies: G-Unit Films in 2003 and Cheetah Vision in 2008. Cheetah Vision produces low budget action thrillers for foreign film markets across the world. When G-Unit Films folded, he focused on Cheetah Vision and the company obtained $200 million in funding in 2010. In 2010, Jackson revived G-Unit Films, renaming the company to G-Unit Films and Television Inc. The company has joint ventures with Will Packer's production company Will Packer Productions and Universal Television. In over 18 months, Jackson has sold projects to six different networks. Among them was \"Power\", a STARZ drama in which he not only co-stars but also serves as co-creator and executive producer. \"Power\" debuted in June 2014 and was renewed for a second season after one episode. \"Power\"s August 2 season finale garnered the high ratings through the season, more than doubling the premiere and it generated 71% of the African-American viewership of any scripted premium series since 2006. Jackson serves as a co‐star, co-creator and executive television producer of the STARZ network drama where he signed a 2-year contract with representation coming from the Agency for the Performing Arts. Ratings have been a success for Starz. with the second-season premiere being the highest-ever season with 1.43 million people tuning in live. Jackson also serves as an executive television producer for \"Dream School\" for SundanceTV, a series that follows fifteen high school dropouts as they are taught by a series of celebrity \"teachers\".\n\nIn July 2011, Jackson launched a philanthropic initiative to provide food for one billion starving people in Africa by 2016, joining Pure Growth Partners to introduce Street King. A portion of the proceeds from each Street King purchase would be used to provide a daily meal to an underprivileged child. The partnership coincides with Jackson's goal to feed a billion people in Africa during the next five years. \"50 Cent and I share a common vision: to address the world's problems through smart and sustainable business models,\" said Chris Clarke, founder and CEO of Pure Growth Partners. \"With the rampant starvation in Africa and hunger afflicting children worldwide, we need socially responsible businesses that affect real change now more than ever.\" Jackson said, \"I'm inspired by Clarke's vision and innovative approaches to tackling serious issues. It's our mission with Street King to really change children's lives around the world.\" In 2011, he founded SMS Audio, a consumer-electronics company selling Street by 50 headphones, pledging to donate a portion of their sales to charity. In April 2015, SMS announced new co-branding deals with Reebok and Marvel. It added those to existing partnerships with Walt Disney Parks, Lucasfilm's Star Wars, and Intel.\n\nIn 2014, Jackson became a minority shareholder in Effen Vodka, a brand of vodka produced in the Netherlands when he invested undisclosed amount in the company Sire Spirits LLC. He currently endorses the product via his live concert performances and social media. The rapper was asked to take part in two promotional bottle signings, one in Oak Creek and another in Sun Prairie. Jackson made an appearance at Liquor Warehouse in Syracuse, New York on April 25, 2015 where he reportedly sold 1,400 bottles (277 gallons) of Jackson's signature liquor brand. Liquor Warehouse's owner George Angeloro reportedly stocked 300 cases (1,800 bottles or 357 gallons) of Effen Vodka, which sells for $30 a bottle, prior to the event.\n\nIn December 2014, Jackson signed a $78 million deal with FRIGO Revolution Wear, a luxury underwear brand. The joint venture is partnered between Jackson, basketball player Carmelo Anthony, baseball legend Derek Jeter and Mathias Ingvarsson, the former president of mattress powerhouse Tempur-Pedic. Jackson became the chief fashion designer for the brands single pair of Frigo boxers. In April 2015, Jackson mulled investing in Jamaica, exploring foreign investment opportunities on the island when he met with some local officials and had ongoing discussions on investment opportunities in the Montego Bay resort area.\n\nOver the years, Jackson invested the millions of dollars in earnings he made from music and celebrity endorsements in an array of privately controlled companies, real estate, and stocks and bonds. A portion of his investments lost value during the 2008 recession. In December 2008 he told the Canadian press that he had been affected by the recession, losing several million dollars in the stock market. Unable to sell his Connecticut mansion, Jackson postponed \"Before I Self-Destruct\" due to the severity of the economic downturn. His Farmington mansion located on 50 Poplar Hill Drive that he tried to sell for years filed for bankruptcy in Connecticut in 2015 listed an asking price for that property in 2012 at $10 million but was valued at $8.3 million in 2015. He first tried to sell the house in 2007 for $18.5 million, and dropped the price several times in the next five years, when it was on and off the market. In January 2011, Jackson reportedly made $10 million after using Twitter to promote a marketing company which he was part shareholder of. His endorsements company G Unit Brands Inc. revealed through a public SEC filing controls 12.9 per cent of H&H Imports, which is a parent company of TV Goods – the firm responsible for marketing his range of headphones, Sleek by 50 Cent. Jackson bought the stock in the company on November 30, 2010, a week after it offered buyers 180 million shares at 17 cents each. Jackson later made a stock recommendation on Twitter, causing its share value to rise from four cents to nearly 50 cents (32p) each, closing on Monday at 39 cents (25p). Jackson was later investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for breaching securities laws following his tweet which may have constituted allegations of Insider trading via his Pump and dump stock investment strategy. In 2013, Jackson became a minority investor in Hang w/, a live video broadcasting mobile app used by dozens of celebrities to broadcast their daily activities and chat with fans. The app downloaded more than 1 million times since its launch in March 2013 and has more than 1 million users . Other minority celebrity investors include former NFL player Terrell Owens and record producer Timbaland.\n\nJackson has been involved in the mining and precious metals industries. In 2008, he visited a platinum, palladium and iridium mine shaft in South Africa, and met with South African billionaire Patrice Motsepe in talks of purchasing an equity stake in the mine. After his meeting with Motsepe, Jackson considered purchasing equity in the mine and launching his own line of 50 Cent branded platinum.\n\nOn July 21, 2012, Jackson became a licensed boxing promoter when he formed his new company, TMT (The Money Team). Licensed to promote in New York, he was in the process of being licensed in Nevada (where most major fights are held in the U.S.). A former amateur boxer, Jackson signed gold medalist and former featherweight champion Yuriorkis Gamboa and middleweight Olympic medalist Andre Dirrell. On July 29, 2012, he and the famed boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr., signed IBF featherweight champion Billy Dib. They unveiled plans to challenge the box-office dominance of mixed martial arts and change the landscape of boxing with TMT Promotions. Boxer Zab Judah also expressed interest in making a deal with Jackson. In December 2012, Mayweather and Jackson parted company, with Jackson taking over the promotion company and founding SMS Promotions with Gamboa, Dirrell, Dib, James Kirkland, Luis Olivares and Donte Strayhorn in his stable.\n\nJackson was the second wealthiest rapper in the hip hop industry, behind Jay-Z in 2007. Jackson, who lives in a Farmington, Connecticut mansion formerly owned by ex-boxer Mike Tyson, has been consistently ranked highly among the wealthiest figures of the American hip hop scene. He was the fifth-richest figure in American hip hop in 2015, with an estimated net worth of $155 million.\n\nJackson received $100,000 for his work in the movie \"Southpaw\" and $50,000 for acting in \"Spy\". He also appears on the Starz television show \"Power\" where receives $20,000 per episode for his appearance and $15,000 bonus for serving as the show's executive producer.\n\nOn July 13, 2015, Jackson filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut with a debt of $32,509,549.91. On July 17, 2015, the Court issued an order allowing a creditor to proceed with the punitive damages phase of a trial against Jackson in a New York state court, in connection with the alleged release of a private video. His assets were listed as between $10 million and $50 million in his bankruptcy petition, though he testified under oath that he is worth $4.4 million. Citing between $10 million and $50 million in debt, and the same amount in assets. Later in the week, Jackson's bankruptcy lawyers elucidated the court documents that legal fees and judgments exceeding $20 million over the past year were the primary cause of the filing. His filings listed 32 entities that he has a stake in. The bankruptcy came days after a jury ordered him to pay $5 million to rapper Rick Ross's ex-girlfriend Lastonia Leviston for invading her privacy by posting online a sex tape of her and another man. In addition, Jackson lost a dispute over a failed business deal to come to fruition to his Sleek headphones, where Jackson invested more than $2 million. An ex-partner accused Jackson of later stealing the design of the \"Sleek by 50\" headphones, prompting a judge to award the partner more than $17.2 million. His Connecticut bankruptcy filing states that he owns seven cars valued at more than $500,000, including a 2010 Rolls Royce and a 1966 Chevrolet Coupe. His expenses of $108,000 a month include $5,000 for gardening along with a monthly income of $185,000, mainly from royalties and income from his external businesses and investments. The court filing says he also owes money to his stylist, his barber and his fitness coach. Other details in the bankruptcy documents included information about two deals that sold the right to collect royalties of on-air play of his music. Half the rights to his portfolio were sold to the British independent music publishing company Kobalt Music Group for $3 million and the other half for another $3 million with the sales of his albums allowing Jackson to own 100 percent of the rights to the master recordings while paying only for distribution. Zeisler & Zeisler, a Bridgeport law firm, represented 50 Cent in the bankruptcy, which later resulted in Jackson filing a $75 million lawsuit against his own lawyers. He stated that his lawyers did a terrible job of representing him, specifically citing the fallout of his failed venture with Sleek Audio headphones and accused Garvey Schubert Barer, a Wall Street law firm of failing to \"employ the requisite knowledge and skill necessary to confront the circumstances of the case.\"\n\n\nOn October 13, 1996, Jackson's girlfriend, Shaniqua Tompkins, gave birth to son Marquise Jackson. Tompkins later sued him for $50 million, saying that he said that he would take care of her for life. The suit, with 15 causes of action, was dismissed by a judge who called it \"an unfortunate tale of a love relationship gone sour.\". The two have bickered for years, and have even taken their feud to social media many times.\n\nMarquise's birth changed Jackson's outlook on life: \"When my son came into my life, my priorities changed, because I wanted to have the relationship with him that I didn't have with my father\". He credited his son for inspiring his career and being the \"motivation to go in a different direction\". Jackson has a tattooed \"Marquise\" with an axe on his right bicep (\"The axe is 'cause I'm a warrior. I don't want him to be one, though\"), and has \"50\", \"Southside\" and \"Cold World\" on his back: \"I'm a product of that environment. It's on my back, though, so it's all behind me\".\n\nJackson dated model Daphne Joy and had his second son, Sire Jackson, with her, on September 1, 2012. At the age of two years, Sire modeled for Kidz Safe, a headphone brand for kids, earning $700,000 through his contract.\n\nIn 2005, Jackson supported President George W. Bush after rapper Kanye West criticized Bush for a slow response to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. If his felony convictions did not prevent him from voting, he said, he would have voted for the president. Jackson later said that Bush \"has less compassion than the average human. By all means, I don't aspire to be like George Bush.\" In September 2007 he told \"Time\" that although he would not endorse a candidate in 2008, he \"liked Hillary [Clinton]\". Six months later the rapper told MTV News that he had switched his support to Barack Obama after hearing him speak, but had lost interest in politics. Asked his opinion of President Obama's May 9, 2012 endorsement of gay marriage, Jackson said, \"I'm for it ... I've encouraged same-sex activities. I've engaged in fetish areas a couple times.\" He had been criticized for anti-gay comments in the past.\n\nDespite having numerous songs that reference drug and alcohol usage, Jackson does not drink alcohol or do drugs, citing a bad experience with alcohol as his main reason.\n\n\"Forbes\" noted Jackson's wealth in 2007, ranking him second behind Jay-Z in the rap industry. He lives in a Farmington, Connecticut mansion formerly owned by ex-boxer Mike Tyson, listing it for sale at $18.5 million to move closer to his son (who lives on Long Island with his ex-girlfriend). The mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut declared October 12, 2007 \"50 Cent Curtis Jackson Day\", honoring the rapper with a proclamation and a key to the city. One of Jackson's New York homes, purchased in January 2007 for $2.4 million and the center of a lawsuit between Jackson and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 31, 2008 while he was filming in Louisiana.\n\nIn December 2008, he told the Canadian press that he had lost several million dollars in the stock market and, unable to sell his Connecticut mansion, had postponed \"Before I Self-Destruct\" because of the economic downturn. Jackson won a lawsuit in November 2009 against Taco Bell over the fast-food chain's use of his name without permission.\n\nIn 2016, regarding his beef with Meek Mill, he commented \"You know, he's really not that bright. That kid is not that bright\" he said. \"The easiest thing you can do is bring other people into the statements you're saying, right, while you're writing music. On May 4, 2016, after making fun of a teenager who, unbeknownst to 50, had a disability, he donated $100,000 to Autism Speaks.\n\nOn June 29, 1994, Jackson was arrested for selling four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was arrested again three weeks later, when police searched his home and found heroin, ten ounces of crack cocaine and a starter's pistol. Although Jackson was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, he served six months in a boot camp (where he earned his high-school equivalency diploma). According to him, he did not use cocaine.\n\nJackson and four members of his entourage were arrested shortly before 2 a.m. on December 31, 2002, when police found a .25-caliber handgun and a .45-caliber pistol in a parked car (which they searched due to its tinted windows) outside a Manhattan nightclub. The rapper was charged with two counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\nJackson was sentenced to two years' probation on July 22, 2005 for a May 2004 incident, when he was charged with three counts of assault and battery after jumping into an audience when he was hit by a water bottle.\n\nJackson filed a lawsuit against an advertising company, Traffix of Pearl River, New York, on July 21, 2007 for using his image in a promotion he said threatened his safety. He was alerted by a staff member to an Internet advertisement on a MySpace page. According to court documents, the advertisement had a cartoon image of the rapper with \"Shoot the rapper and you will win $5000 or five ring tones guaranteed\". Although the ad did not use his name, the image allegedly resembled him and suggested that he endorsed the product. The lawsuit, calling the ad a \"vile, tasteless and despicable\" use of Jackson's image which \"quite literally call[ed] for violence against him\", sought unspecified punitive damages and a permanent injunction against the use of his image without permission.\n\nWhile walking through Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in May 2016, Jackson harassed and insulted a janitor at the airport, accusing him of being under the influence. The janitor was a hearing-impaired, autistic teenager named Andrew Farrell. The parents of the janitor had seen the viral video as disrespect and wanted to sue Jackson for his action against their child. The lawsuit was originally over one million dollars, but the parents settled for a $100,000 donation to Autism Speaks and his apology.\n\nIn 2016, a judge declared that Brandon Parrott gave Dr. Dre and 50 Cent the rights to \"Bamba\" for the song \"P.I.M.P.\"\n\nOne of his New York homes, purchased for $2.4 million in January 2007 and the center of a lawsuit between Jackson and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 30, 2008 while he was filming in Louisiana. On August 5, 2013, Jackson pleaded not guilty to one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism in a Los Angeles County court. If convicted of all charges, he faced up to five years in prison and a $46,000 fine. Model-actress Daphne Joy accused Jackson of kicking her and ransacking her bedroom during an argument at her condominium in the Toluca Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles on June 23. He allegedly caused $7,100 in property damage, leaving the scene before police arrived.\n\nJudge Ann Nevins has ordered Jackson back to court because of Instagram messages he made over several months. She said Jackson was not fully clear about his funds and indicated posts of the rapper showing stacks of his money. In March 2016, Jackson claimed that he would no longer use Instagram, electing instead to have his profile page operated by someone else.\n\nBefore he signed with Interscope Records, Jackson engaged in a public dispute with rapper Ja Rule and his label, Murder Inc. Records, saying that a friend robbed jewelry from Ja Rule and the latter accused him of orchestrating the robbery. Ja Rule said that the conflict stemmed from a Queens video shoot, when Jackson did not like seeing him \"getting so much love\" from the neighborhood. At The Hit Factory in New York in March 2000, Jackson had an altercation with Murder Inc. associates and received three stitches for a stab wound. Rapper Black Child claimed responsibility for the stabbing, saying that he acted in self-defense when he thought someone reached for a gun.\n\nAn affidavit by an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent suggested ties between Murder Inc. and Kenneth \"Supreme\" McGriff, a New York drug lord suspected of involvement in the murder of Jam Master Jay and Jackson's shooting. An excerpt read:\n\nThe end of the Jackson-Ja Rule feud was confirmed in May 2011. According to Ja Rule, \"I'm cool. We ain't beefing no more. We'll never collaborate. That's just what it is. You don't have to be at war with somebody, but it's also kind of like U.S. and another country that they may not get along with. We don't gotta go to war, but we're not friends either. But we can coincide inside of a world. He's doing him, and he's not thinking about me, and I'm doing me and I'm not thinking about him.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2015, the feud between the two rappers later reignited when Ja gave a feedback to a social follower via Twitter over a similar feud between Meek Mill and Drake. Enraged, Jackson later responded back with photos and comments via Instagram, only siding with Drake. The feud resurfaced three years later on January 19, 2018 when Ja Rule took to Twitter, calling out 50 Cent on social media.\n\nAlthough Jackson was close to The Game before the latter released his debut album, \"The Documentary\", they grew apart. After \"The Documentary\"s release, Jackson felt that The Game was disloyal for saying that he did not want to participate in G-Unit's feuds with other rappers (such as Nas, Jadakiss and Fat Joe) and his desire to work with artists with which G-Unit was feuding. He said that he wrote six songs for the album and did not receive proper credit, which The Game denied.\nJackson later dismissed The Game from G-Unit on Hot 97. After the announcement, The Game (a guest earlier in the evening) tried to enter the building with his entourage. After they were denied entry, one of his associates was shot in the leg in a confrontation with a group of men leaving the building. When the situation escalated the rappers held a joint press conference announcing their reconciliation, and fans were uncertain if the rappers had staged a publicity stunt to boost sales of their recently released albums. After the situation cooled, G-Unit criticized The Game's street credibility and announced that they would not appear on his albums. During a Summer Jam performance The Game announced a boycott of G-Unit, which he called \"G-Unot\".\n\nAfter the Summer Jam performance The Game recorded \"300 Bars and Runnin'\", an extended \"diss\" of G-Unit and Roc-A-Fella Records, for the mixtape \"You Know What It Is Vol. 3\". Jackson responded with his \"Piggy Bank\" music video, with The Game as Mr. Potato Head and parodies of other rivals. They have continued attacking each other, with The Game releasing two more mixtapes: \"Ghost Unit\" and a mixtape-DVD, \"Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin\". Jackson superimposed The Game's head on the body of a male stripper for the cover of the \"Hate It or Love It (G-Unit Radio Part 21)\" mixtape in response to The Game's pictures of G-Unit dressed as the Village People. The Game, under contract to Aftermath Entertainment, signed with Geffen Records to terminate his contractual obligations with G-Unit (although it is claimed that Jackson pressured Dr. Dre to fire him). G-Unit member Spider Loc has insulted The Game in songs, and the latter released \"240 Bars (Spider Joke)\" and \"100 Bars (The Funeral)\" attacking G-Unit and Loc. Jackson's response was \"Not Rich, Still Lyin'\", mocking The Game. Lloyd Banks replied to the Game on a \"Rap City\" freestyle-booth segment, followed by a Game \"diss\" song (\"SoundScan\") ridiculing the 13-position drop of Banks' album \"Rotten Apple\" on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart and its disappointing second-week sales. Banks replied on his mixtape \"Mo' Money In The Bank Pt. 5: Gang Green Season Continues\" with \"Showtime (The Game's Over)\", said that Jackson wrote half of \"The Documentary\" and ridiculed The Game's suicidal thoughts.\n\nIn October 2006, The Game made a peace overture (which was not immediately answered) to Jackson, but two days later he said on Power 106 that the peace offer was valid for only one day. In several songs on \"Doctor's Advocate\", he implied that the feud was over. He said in July 2009 that the feud had ended with help from Michael Jackson and Diddy, and apologized for his actions. According to Tony Yayo, neither Jackson nor G-Unit accepted his apology and The Game has resumed his calls for a \"G-Unot\" boycott at concerts. Jackson released \"So Disrespectful\" on \"Before I Self Destruct\", targeting Jay-Z, The Game and Young Buck. The Game responded with \"Shake\", poking fun at the music video for Jackson's \"Candy Shop\".\n\nOn August 1, 2016, 50 Cent ended his twelve-year feud with The Game when the two were in the Ace of Diamonds Strip Club and The Game said \"What happened, that shit was 12 years ago.\"\n\nAlthough Rick Ross began a feud with Jackson over an alleged incident at the January 2009 BET Awards, Jackson told news sources he did not remember seeing Ross there. Late that month Ross' \"Mafia Music\" was leaked on the Internet, with lyrics apparently disparaging Jackson. Several days later, Jackson released \"Officer Ricky (Go Head, Try Me)\" in response to \"Mafia Music\". The following day, Ross appeared on Shade 45 (Eminem's Sirius channel) and told Jackson to come up with something better in 24 hours.\n\nBefore leaving for Venezuela, Jackson uploaded a video (\"Warning Shot\", telling Ross \"I'ma fuck your life up for fun\") and the first of a series of \"Officer Ricky\" cartoons. In early February he uploaded a YouTube video in which he interviewed \"Tia\", the mother of one of Ross' children; according to her, Ross is in reality a correctional officer. On February 5, 2009, The Game phoned Seattle radio station KUBE. Asked about the dispute between Jackson and Ross, he sided with Jackson and offered to mediate: \"Rick Ross, holla at your boy, man\" and \"50 eating you, boy.\"\n\nOn his album \"Deeper Than Rap\", Ross refers to Jackson in \"In Cold Blood\" and Jackson's mock funeral is part of the song's video. When the song was released, Ross said that he ended Jackson's career. \"Rick Ross is Albert From CB4. You ever seen the movie? He's Albert,\" Jackson replied in an interview. \"It never gets worse than this. You get a guy that was a correctional officer come out and base his entire career on writing material from a drug dealer's perspective such as \"Freeway\" Ricky Ross.\" Their feud rekindled at the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards, where Jackson and G-Unit members Kidd Kidd, Mike Knox, Tony Yayo were seen on video attacking Gunplay (a member of Ross' Maybach Music Group). Gunplay's Maybach Music diamond necklace was stolen during the brawl, and several days later Jackson appeared at a Washington, D.C. bowling alley wearing Gunplay's chain. On January 30, 2013, Jackson tweeted that Ross' attempted drive-by shooting on his birthday three days earlier was \"staged\".\n\nRecently his feud with Rick Ross has been resurfacing.\n\nStudio albums\n\nCollaborative albums\n\n\n"}

It was Kool Herc who coined the term B-boy and B-girls for the African American teenage Funk dancers that attended his earliest parties. Sasa along with the first generation B-boys, Trixie, Wallace, Dancing Doug, The Legendary Twins, DJ Clark Kent, Chip The Mad Hatter and a few others from Kool Herc's parties, set the foundation for the B-boy dance style in Hip-Hop taking it to the floor, performing acrobatic moves. Originating from the music of James Brown records and breakbeats, along with many other funk hits. The 3rd generation of dancers later introduced the B-boy dance as (Breakdancing) into the mass media, because of the popularity of Hip-Hop becoming a mainstream genre in the early 1980's.\n\nSasa was born in Manhattan New York City and raised in the West Bronx. From childhood he grew up dancing to R&B, Soul and Funk music, early on he began getting recognition from his school peers for his fine dancing skills at school parties and later in his teenage years. Many of his friends began inviting him to house parties where he made a name for himself on the dance floor with his unique style, especially at Kool Herc parties where the best dancers from all over the Bronx and Harlem went to get down, and even dancers from Brooklyn. The best B-boy dancer was given the title \"(A1).\" Sasa, like most of the \"first generation originals,\" stopped B-boy dancing by 1977. He retired undefeated never losing a B-boy battle. The original (1975-77) Zulu king's B-boys popularity and influence brought in the era of forming break crews also known as rockers, with the Zulu's adding \"new footwork and acrobatic tricks\" to the foundation of the dance, causing it to become a city-wide competitive trend amongst the youth, \"which established this performing art form between the years of 1973 to 1977. After that, new generation B-boy crews began to pop up in communities all across the city.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "14200011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14200011", "title": "BCM theory", "text": "BCM theory\n\nBCM theory, BCM synaptic modification, or the BCM rule, named for Elie Bienenstock, Leon Cooper, and Paul Munro, is a physical theory of learning in the visual cortex developed in 1981. Due to its successful experimental predictions, the theory is arguably the most accurate model of synaptic plasticity to date.\n\nThe BCM model proposes a sliding threshold for Long-term potentiation (LTP) or Long-term depression (LTD) induction, and states that synaptic plasticity is stabilized by a dynamic adaptation of the time-averaged postsynaptic activity. According to the BCM model, when a pre-synaptic neuron fires, the post-synaptic neurons will tend to undergo LTP if it is in a high-activity state (e.g., is firing at high frequency, and/or has high internal calcium concentrations), or LTD if it is in a lower-activity state (e.g., firing in low frequency, low internal calcium concentrations). This theory is often used to explain how cortical neurons can undergo both LTP or LTD depending on different conditioning stimulus protocols applied to pre-synaptic neurons (usually high-frequency stimulation, or HFS, for LTP, or low-frequency stimulation, LFS, for LTD).\n\nIn 1949, Donald Hebb proposed a working mechanism for memory and computational adaption in the brain now called Hebbian learning, or the maxim that \"cells that fire together, wire together\". This law formed the basis of the brain as the modern neural network, theoretically capable of Turing complete computational complexity, and thus became a standard materialist model for the mind.\n\nHowever, Hebb's rule has problems, namely that it has no mechanism for connections to get weaker and no upper bound for how strong they can get. In other words, the model is unstable, both theoretically and computationally. Later modifications gradually improved Hebb's rule, normalizing it and allowing for decay of synapses, where no activity or unsynchronized activity between neurons results in a loss of connection strength. New biological evidence brought this activity to a peak in the 1970s, where theorists formalized various approximations in the theory, such as the use of firing frequency instead of potential in determining neuron excitation, and the assumption of ideal and, more importantly, linear synaptic integration of signals. That is, there is no unexpected behavior in the adding of input currents to determine whether or not a cell will fire.\n\nThese approximations resulted in the basic form of BCM below in 1979, but the final step came in the form of mathematical analysis to prove stability and computational analysis to prove applicability, culminating in Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro's 1982 paper.\n\nSince then, experiments have shown evidence for BCM behavior in both the visual cortex and the hippocampus, the latter of which plays an important role in the formation and storage of memories. Both of these areas are well-studied experimentally, but both theory and experiment have yet to establish conclusive synaptic behavior in other areas of the brain. It has been proposed that in the cerebellum, the parallel-fiber to Purkinje cell synapse follows an \"inverse BCM rule\", meaning that at the time of parallel fiber activation, a high calcium concentration in the Purkinje cell results in LTD, while a lower concentration results in LTP. Furthermore, a biological mechanism for synaptic plasticity in BCM has yet to be established.\n\nThe basic BCM rule takes the form\n\nwhere formula_2 is the synaptic weight of the formula_3th synapse, formula_4 is that synapse's input current, formula_5 is the weighted presynaptic output vector, formula_6 is the postsynaptic activation function that changes sign at some output threshold formula_7, and formula_8 is the (often negligible) time constant of uniform decay of all synapses.\n\nThis model is merely a modified form of the Hebbian learning rule, formula_9, and requires a suitable choice of activation function, or rather, the output threshold, to avoid the Hebbian problems of instability. This threshold was derived rigorously in BCM noting that with formula_10 and the approximation of the average output formula_11, for one to have stable learning it is sufficient that\n\nor equivalently, that the threshold formula_14, where formula_15 and formula_16 are fixed positive constants.\n\nWhen implemented, the theory is often taken such that\n\nwhere angle brackets are a time average and formula_18 is the time constant of selectivity.\n\nThe model has drawbacks, as it requires both long-term potentiation and long-term depression, or increases and decreases in synaptic strength, something which has not been observed in all cortical systems. Further, it requires a variable activation threshold and depends strongly on stability of the selected fixed points formula_16 and formula_15. However, the model's strength is that it incorporates all these requirements from independently derived rules of stability, such as normalizability and a decay function with time proportional to the square of the output.\n\nThe first major experimental confirmation of BCM came in 1992 in investigating LTP and LTD in the hippocampus. The data showed qualitative agreement with the final form of the BCM activation function. This experiment was later replicated in the visual cortex, which BCM was originally designed to model. This work provided further evidence of the necessity for a variable threshold function for stability in Hebbian-type learning (BCM or others).\n\nExperimental evidence has been non-specific to BCM until Rittenhouse \"et al.\" confirmed BCM's prediction of synapse modification in the visual cortex when one eye is selectively closed. Specifically,\n\nwhere formula_22 describes the variance in spontaneous activity or noise in the closed eye and formula_23 is time since closure. Experiment agreed with the general shape of this prediction and provided an explanation for the dynamics of monocular eye closure (monocular deprivation) versus binocular eye closure. The experimental results are far from conclusive, but so far have favored BCM over competing theories of plasticity.\n\nWhile the algorithm of BCM is too complicated for large-scale parallel distributed processing, it has been put to use in lateral networks with some success. Furthermore, some existing computational network learning algorithms have been made to correspond to BCM learning.\n\n"}
{"id": "4584230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4584230", "title": "Biomarker (medicine)", "text": "Biomarker (medicine)\n\nIn medicine, a biomarker is a measurable indicator of the severity or presence of some disease state. More generally a biomarker is anything that can be used as an indicator of a particular disease state or some other physiological state of an organism.\n\nA biomarker can be a substance that is introduced into an organism as a means to examine organ function or other aspects of health. For example, rubidium chloride is used in isotopic labeling to evaluate perfusion of heart muscle. It can also be a substance whose detection indicates a particular disease state, for example, the presence of an antibody may indicate an infection. More specifically, a biomarker indicates a change in expression or state of a protein that correlates with the risk or progression of a disease, or with the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment. Biomarkers can be characteristic biological properties or molecules that can be detected and measured in parts of the body like the blood or tissue. They may indicate either normal or diseased processes in the body. Biomarkers can be specific cells, molecules, or genes, gene products, enzymes, or hormones. Complex organ functions or general characteristic changes in biological structures can also serve as biomarkers. Although the term biomarker is relatively new, biomarkers have been used in pre-clinical research and clinical diagnosis for a considerable time. For example, body temperature is a well-known biomarker for fever. Blood pressure is used to determine the risk of stroke. It is also widely known that cholesterol values are a biomarker and risk indicator for coronary and vascular disease, and that C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker for inflammation.\n\nBiomarkers are useful in a number of ways, including measuring the progress of disease, evaluating the most effective therapeutic regimes for a particular cancer type, and establishing long-term susceptibility to cancer or its recurrence. The parameter can be chemical, physical or biological. In molecular terms biomarker is \"the subset of markers that might be discovered using genomics, proteomics technologies or imaging technologies. Biomarkers play major roles in medicinal biology. Biomarkers help in early diagnosis, disease prevention, drug target identification, drug response etc. Several biomarkers have been identified for many diseases such as serum LDL for cholesterol, blood pressure, and P53 gene and MMPs as tumor markers for cancer.\n\nIt is necessary to distinguish between \"disease-related\" and \"drug-related biomarkers\". Disease-related biomarkers give an indication of the probable effect of treatment on patient (risk indicator or predictive biomarkers), if a disease already exists (diagnostic biomarker), or how such a disease may develop in an individual case regardless of the type of treatment (prognostic biomarker). Predictive biomarkers help to assess the most likely response to a particular treatment type, while prognostic markers shows the progression of disease with or without treatment. In contrast, drug-related biomarkers indicate whether a drug will be effective in a specific patient and how the patient’s body will process it.\n\nIn addition to long-known parameters, such as those included and objectively measured in a blood count, there are numerous novel biomarkers used in the various medical specialties. Currently, intensive work is taking place on the discovery and development of innovative and more effective biomarkers. These \"new\" biomarkers have become the basis for preventive medicine, meaning medicine that recognises diseases or the risk of disease early, and takes specific countermeasures to prevent the development of disease. Biomarkers are also seen as the key to personalised medicine, treatments individually tailored to specific patients for highly efficient intervention in disease processes. Often, such biomarkers indicate changes in metabolic processes.\n\nThe \"classic\" biomarker in medicine is a laboratory parameter that the doctor can use to help make decisions in making a diagnosis and selecting a course of treatment. For example, the detection of certain autoantibodies in patient blood is a reliable biomarker for autoimmune disease, and the detection of rheumatoid factors has been an important diagnostic marker for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for over 50 years.\nFor the diagnosis of this autoimmune disease the antibodies against the bodies own citrullinated proteins are of particular value. These ACPAs, (ACPA stands for \"A\"nti-\"c\"itrullinated \"p\"rotein/peptide \"a\"ntibody) can be detected in the blood before the first symptoms of RA appear. They are thus highly valuable biomarkers for the early diagnosis of this autoimmune disease. In addition, they indicate if the disease threatens to be severe with serious damage to the bones and joints, which is an important tool for the doctor when providing a diagnosis and developing a treatment plan.\n\nThere are also more and more indications that ACPAs can be very useful in monitoring the success of treatment for RA. This would make possible the accurate use of modern treatments with biologicals. Physicians hope to soon be able to individually tailor rheumatoid arthritis treatments for each patient.\n\nAccording to Häupl T. et al. prediction of response to treament will become the most important aim of biomarker research in medicine. With the growing number of new biological agents, there is increasing pressure to identify molecular parameters such as ACPAs that will not only guide the therapeutic decision but also help to define the most important targets for which new biological agents should be tested in clinical studies.\n\nAn NIH study group committed to the following definition in 1998: \"a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.\" \nIn the past, biomarkers were primarily physiological indicators such as blood pressure or heart rate. More recently, biomarker is becoming a synonym for molecular biomarker, such as elevated prostate specific antigen as a molecular biomarker for prostate cancer, or using enzyme assays as liver function tests. There has recently been heightened interest in the relevance of biomarkers in oncology, including the role of KRAS in colorectal cancer and other EGFR-associated cancers. In patients whose tumors express the mutated KRAS gene, the KRAS protein, which forms part of the EGFR signaling pathway, is always ‘turned on’. This overactive EGFR signaling means that signaling continues downstream – even when the upstream signaling is blocked by an EGFR inhibitor, such as cetuximab (Erbitux) – and results in continued cancer cell growth and proliferation. Testing a tumor for its KRAS status (wild-type vs. mutant) helps to identify those patients who will benefit most from treatment with cetuximab.\n\nCurrently, effective treatment is available for only a small percentage of cancer patients. In addition, many cancer patients are diagnosed at a stage where the cancer has advanced too far to be treated. Biomarkers have the ability to greatly enhance cancer detection and the drug development process. In addition, biomarkers will enable physicians to develop individualized treatment plans for their cancer patients; thus allowing doctors to tailor drugs specific to their patient's tumor type. By doing so, drug response rate will improve, drug toxicity will be limited and costs associated with testing various therapies and the ensuing treatment for side effects will decrease.\n\nBiomarkers also cover the use of molecular indicators of environmental exposure in epidemiologic studies such as human papilloma virus or certain markers of tobacco exposure such as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). To date no biomarkers have been established for head and neck cancer.\n\nOnce a proposed biomarker has been validated, it can be used to diagnose disease risk, presence of disease in an individual, or to tailor treatments for the disease in an individual (choices of drug treatment or administration regimes). In evaluating potential drug therapies, a biomarker may be used as a surrogate for a natural endpoint such as survival or irreversible morbidity. If a treatment alters the biomarker, which has a direct connection to improved health, the biomarker serves as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating clinical benefit.\nSome of the main areas in which molecular biomarkers are used in the drug development process are: early drug development studies, safety studies, proof of concept studies, and molecular profiling.\n\nMolecular biomarkers are often used in early drug development studies. For instance, they are used in phase I study for establishing doses and dosing regimen for future phase II studies. PD biomarkers are commonly observed to respond (either decrease or increase) proportionally with dose. This data, in conjunction with safety data, help determine doses for phase II studies. \nIn addition, Safety molecular biomarkers have been used for decades both in preclinical and clinical research. Since these tests have become mainstream tests, they have been fully automated for both animal and human testing. Among the most common safety tests are those of liver function (e.g., transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) and kidney function (e.g., serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, cystatin C). Others include markers of skeletal muscle(e.g., myoglobin) or cardiac muscle injury (e.g., CK-MB, troponin I or T), as well as bone biomarkers (e.g., bone-specific alkaline phosphatase).\n\nFor chronic diseases, whose treatment may require patients to take medications for years, accurate diagnosis is particularly important, especially when strong side effects are expected from the treatment. In these cases, biomarkers are becoming more and more important, because they can confirm a difficult diagnosis or even make it possible in the first place.\nA number of diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or rheumatoid arthritis, often begin with an early, symptom-free phase. In such symptom-free patients there may be more or less probability of actually developing symptoms. In these cases, biomarkers help to identify high-risk individuals reliably and in a timely manner so that they can either be treated before onset of the disease or as soon as possible thereafter.\n\nIn order to use a biomarker for diagnostics, the sample material must be as easy to obtain as possible. This may be a blood sample taken by a doctor, a urine or saliva sample, or a drop of blood like those diabetes patients extract from their own fingertips for regular blood-sugar monitoring.\n\nFor rapid initiation of treatment, the speed with which a result is obtained from the biomarker test is critical. A rapid test, which delivers a result after only a few minutes, is optimal. This makes it possible for the physician to discuss with the patient how to proceed and if necessary to start treatment immediately after the test.\n\nNaturally, the detection method for a biomarker must be accurate and as easy to carry out as possible. The results from different laboratories may not differ significantly from each other, and the biomarker must naturally have proven its effectiveness for the diagnosis, prognosis, and risk assessment of the affected diseases in independent studies.\n\nA biomarker for clinical use needs good sensitivity and specificity e.g. ≥0.9, and good specificity e.g. ≥0.9 although they should be chosen with the population in mind so positive predictive value and negative predictive value are more relevant.\n\nBiomarkers can be classified based on different criteria. \n\nBased on their characteristics they can be classified as imaging biomarkers (CT, PET, MRI) or molecular biomarkers with three subtypes: volatile, like breath, body fluid or biopsy biomarkers. \n\nMolecular biomarkers refer to nonimaging biomarkers that have biophysical properties, which allow their measurements in biological samples (e.g., plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage, biopsy) and include nucleic acids-based biomarkers such as gene mutations or polymorphisms and quantitative gene expression analysis, peptides, proteins, lipids metabolites, and other small molecules. \n\nBiomarkers can also be classified based on their application such as diagnostic biomarkers (i.e., cardiac troponin for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction), staging of disease biomarkers (i.e., brain natriuretic peptide for congestive heart failure), disease prognosis biomarkers (cancer biomarkers), and biomarkers for monitoring the clinical response to an intervention (HbAlc for antidiabetic treatment). \nAnother category of biomarkers includes those used in decision making in early drug development. For instance, pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers are markers of a certain pharmacological response, which are of special interest in dose optimization studies.\n\nBiomarkers validated by genetic and molecular biology methods can be classified into three types.\n\n\nMolecular biomarkers have been defined as biomarkers that can be discovered using basic and acceptable platforms such as genomics and proteomics. Many genomic and proteomics techniques are available for biomarker discovery and a few techniques that are recently being used can be found on that page. Apart from genomics and proteomics platforms biomarker assay techniques, metabolomics, lipidomics, glycomics, and secretomics are the most commonly used as techniques in identification of biomarkers.\n\nMany new biomarkers are being developed that involve imaging technology. Imaging biomarkers have many advantages. They are usually noninvasive, and they produce intuitive, multidimensional results. Yielding both qualitative and quantitative data, they are usually relatively comfortable for patients. When combined with other sources of information, they can be very useful to clinicians seeking to make a diagnosis.\n\nCardiac imaging is an active area of biomarker research. Coronary angiography, an invasive procedure requiring catheterization, has long been the gold standard for diagnosing arterial stenosis, but scientists and doctors hope to develop noninvasive techniques. Many believe that cardiac computed tomography (CT) has great potential in this area, but researchers are still attempting to overcome problems related to “calcium blooming,” a phenomenon in which calcium deposits interfere with image resolution. Other intravascular imaging techniques involving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and near infrared spectroscopy are also being investigated.\n\nAnother new imaging biomarker involves radiolabeled fludeoxyglucose. Positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to measure where in the body cells take up glucose. By tracking glucose, doctors can find sites of inflammation because macrophages there take up glucose at high levels. Tumors also take up a lot of glucose, so the imaging strategy can be used to monitor them as well. Tracking radiolabeled glucose is a promising technique because it directly measures a step known to be crucial to inflammation and tumor growth.\n\nMRI has the advantages of having very high spatial resolution and is very adept at morphological imaging and functional imaging. MRI does have several disadvantages though. First, MRI has a sensitivity of around 10 mol/L to 10 mol/L which, compared to other types of imaging, can be very limiting. This problem stems from the fact that the difference between atoms in the high energy state and the low energy state is very small. For example, at 1.5 tesla, a typical field strength for clinical MRI, the difference between high and low energy states is approximately 9 molecules per 2 million. Improvements to increase MR sensitivity include increasing magnetic field strength, and hyperpolarization via optical pumping or dynamic nuclear polarization. There are also a variety of signal amplification schemes based on chemical exchange that increase sensitivity.\n\nTo achieve molecular imaging of disease biomarkers using MRI, targeted MRI contrast agents with high specificity and high relaxivity (sensitivity) are required. To date, many studies have been devoted to developing targeted-MRI contrast agents to achieve molecular imaging by MRI. Commonly, peptides, antibodies, or small ligands, and small protein domains, such as HER-2 affibodies, have been applied to achieve targeting. To enhance the sensitivity of the contrast agents, these targeting moieties are usually linked to high payload MRI contrast agents or MRI contrast agents with high relaxivities.\n\nNot all biomarkers should be used as surrogate endpoints to assess clinical outcomes. Biomarkers can be difficult to validate and require different levels of validation depending on their intended use. If a biomarker is to be used to measure the success of a therapeutic intervention, the biomarker should reflect a direct effect of that medicine.\n\n"}

{"id": "55986595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55986595", "title": "Capsule neural network", "text": "Capsule neural network\n\nA Capsule Neural Network (CapsNet) is a machine learning system that is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that can be used to better model hierarchical relationships. The approach is an attempt to more closely mimic biological neural organization. \n\nThe idea is to add structures called capsules to a convolutional neural network (CNN), and to reuse output from several of those capsules to form more stable (with respect to various perturbations) representations for higher order capsules. The output is a vector consisting of the probability of an observation, and a pose for that observation. This vector is similar to what is done for example when doing \"classification with localization\" in CNNs.\n\nAmong other benefits, capsnets address the \"Picasso problem\" in image recognition: images that have all the right parts but that are not in the correct spatial relationship (e.g., in a \"face\", the positions of the mouth and one eye are switched). For image recognition, capsnets exploit the fact that while viewpoint changes have nonlinear effects at the pixel level, they have linear effects at the part/object level. This can be compared to inverting the rendering of an object of multiple parts.\n\nIn 2000 Geoffrey Hinton et. al. described an imaging system that combined segmentation and recognition into a single inference process using parse trees. So-called credibility networks described the joint distribution over the latent variables and over the possible parse trees. That system proved useful on the MNIST handwritten digit database.\n\nA dynamic routing mechanism for capsule networks was introduced by Hinton and his team in 2017. The approach was claimed to reduce error rates on MNIST and to reduce training set sizes. Results were claimed to be considerably better than a CNN on highly overlapped digits. \n\nIn Hinton's original idea one minicolumn would represent and detect one multidimensional entity.\n\nEquivariance is the detection of objects that can transform to each other. A spatial relationship can be characterized represented by its \"pose\", data that describes the object's translation and rotation. Translation is a change in location in one or more dimensions, while rotation is a change in orientation.\n\nUnsupervised capsnets learn a global linear manifold between a whole object and its pose (as a matrix of weights). As such, the \"translation invariance\" is encapsulated in the weights, rather than in neural activity (recognition), making the network \"translation equivariant\". Multiplying the object by the manifold thereby poses the object (for an object, in space).\n\nCapsnets reject the pooling layer strategy of conventional CNNs that reduces the amount of detail to be processed at the next higher layer. Pooling allows a degree of translational invariance (it can recognize the same object in a somewhat different location) and allows a larger number of feature types to be represented. Capsnet proponents argue that pooling:\n\nA capsule is a set of neurons that individually activate for various properties of a type of object, such as position, size and hue. Formally, a capsule is a set of neurons that collectively produce an \"activity vector\" with one element for each neuron to hold that neuron's instantiation value (e.g., hue). Graphics programs use instantiation value to draw an object. Capsnets attempt to derive these from their input. The probability of the entity's presence in a specific input is the vector's length, while the vector's orientation quantifies the capsule's properties.\n\nArtificial neurons traditionally output a scalar, real-valued activation that loosely represents the probability of an observation. Capsnets replace scalar-output feature detectors with vector-output capsules and max-pooling with routing-by-agreement. \n\nBecause capsules are independent, when multiple capsules agree, the probability of correct detection is much higher. A minimal cluster of two capsules considering a six-dimensional entity would agree within 10% by chance only once in a million trials. As the number of dimensions increase, the likelihood of a chance agreement across a larger cluster with higher dimensions decreases exponentially.\n\nCapsules in higher layers take outputs from capsules at lower layers, and accept those whose outputs cluster. A cluster causes the higher capsule to output a high probability of observation that an entity is present and also output a high-dimensional (20-50+) pose.\n\nHigher-level capsules ignore outliers, concentrating on clusters. This is similar to the Hough transform, the RHT and RANSAC from classic digital image processing.\n\nThe outputs from one capsule (child) are routed to capsules in the next layer (parent) according to the child's ability to predict the parents' outputs. Over the course of a few iterations, each parents' outputs may converge with the predictions of some children and diverge from those of others, meaning that that parent is present or absent from the scene.\n\nFor each possible parent, each child computes a prediction vector by multiplying its output by a weight matrix (trained by backpropagation). Next the output of the parent is computed as the scalar product of a prediction with a coefficient representing the probability that this child belongs to that parent. A child whose predictions are relatively close to the resulting output successively increases the coefficient between that parent and child and decreases it for parents that it matches less well. This increases the contribution that that child makes to that parent, thus increasing the scalar product of the capsule’s prediction with the parent’s output. After a few iterations, the coefficients strongly connect a parent to its most likely children, indicating that the presence of the children imply the presence of the parent in the scene. The more children whose predictions are close to a parent's output, the more quickly the coefficients grow, driving convergence. The pose of the parent (reflected in its output) progressively becomes compatible with that of its children.\n\nThe coefficients' initial logits are the log prior probabilities that a child belongs to a parent. The priors can be trained discriminatively along with the weights. The priors depend on the location and type of the child and parent capsules, but not on the current input. At each iteration, the coefficients are adjusted via a \"routing\" softmax so that they continue to sum to 1 (to express the probability that a given capsule is the parent of a given child.) Softmax amplifies larger values and diminishes smaller values beyond their proportion of the total. Similarly, the probability that a feature is present in the input is exaggerated by a nonlinear \"squashing\" function that reduces values (smaller ones drastically and larger ones such that they are less than 1).\n\nThis dynamic routing mechanism provides the necessary deprecation of alternatives (\"explaining away\") that is needed for segmenting overlapped objects.\n\nThis learned routing of signals has no clear biological equivalent. Some operations can be found in cortical layers, but they do not seem to relate this technique.\n\nThe pose vector formula_1 is rotated and translated by a matrix formula_2 into a vector formula_3 that predicts the output of the parent capsule.\n\nCapsules formula_5 in the next higher level are fed the sum of the predictions from all capsules in the lower layer, each with a coupling coefficient formula_6 \n\nThe coupling coefficients from a capsule formula_8 in layer formula_9 to all capsules in layer formula_10 sum to one, and are defined by a \"routing softmax\". The initial logits formula_11 are prior log probabilities for the routing. That is the prior probability that capsule formula_8 in layer formula_9 should connect to capsule formula_14 in layer formula_10. Normalization of the coupling coefficients:\n\nFor this procedure to be optimum it would have to memorize several values, and reset those values on each iteration. That is if the vector formula_17 changes, then the memorized values must be updated. It is not shown how this should be done. Neither memorizing the divisor is shown.\n\nBecause the length of the vectors represents probabilities they should be between zero (0) and one (1), and to do that a squashing function is applied:\n\nA vector squashed to zero has a vanishing gradient.\n\nOne approach to routing is the following\n\nAt line 8, the softmax function can be replaced by any type of winner-take-all network. Biologically this somewhat resembles chandelier cells, but they can also be involved in calculation of coupling coefficients (line 9) or calculation of agreements (line 11).\n\nAt line 9, the weight matrix for the coupling coefficients and the hidden prediction matrix are shown. The structure in layer I and II is somewhat similar to the cerebral cortex if stellate cells are assumed to be involved in transposing input vectors. Whether both types of stellate cells have the same function is not clear, as layer I has excitatory spiny cells and layer II has inhibitory aspiny cells. The latter indicates a much different network.\n\nAt line 10, the squash function can be replaced by other functions and network topologies that retain the vector direction.\n\nThe procedure conducts formula_20 iterations, usually 4–5, with formula_9 the index for the source capsule layer or primary layer, where the routing goes \"from\", and the capsule layer formula_10 the next higher layer.\n\nLearning is supervised. The network is trained by minimizing the euclidean distance between the image and the output of a CNN that reconstructs the input from the output of the terminal capsules.\n\nThe network is discriminatively trained, using iterative routing-by-agreement.\n\nThe activity vectors of all but the correct parent are masked.\n\nThe length of the instantiation vector represents the probability that a capsule’s entity is present in the scene. A top-level capsule has a long vector if and only if its associated entity is present. To allow for multiple entities, a separate margin loss is computed for each capsule. Downweighting the loss for absent entities stops the learning from shrinking activity vector lengths for all entities. The total loss is the sum of the losses of all entities. In Hinton's example the loss function is:\n\nThis type of loss function is common in ANNs. The parameters formula_24 and formula_25 are set so the length does not max out or collapse, formula_26 and formula_27. Down-weighting of initial weights for absent classes are controlled by formula_28, with formula_29 as a reasonable choice.\n\nAn additional reconstruction loss encourages entities to encode their inputs' instantiation parameters. The final activity vector is then used to reconstruct the input image via a CNN decoder consisting of 3 fully connected layers. The reconstruction minimizes the sum of squared differences between the outputs of the logistic units and the pixel intensities. This reconstruction loss is scaled down by 0.0005 so that it does not dominate the margin loss during training.\n\nThe first convolutional layers perform feature extraction. For the 28x28 pixel MNIST image test an initial 256 9x9 pixel convolutional kernels (using stride 1 and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, defining 20x20 receptive fields) convert the pixel input into 1D feature activations and induce nonlinearity.\n\nThe primary (lowest) capsule layer divides the 256 kernels into 32 capsules of 8 9x9 kernels each (using stride 2, defining 6x6 receptive fields). Capsule activations effectively invert the graphics rendering process, going from pixels to features. A single weight matrix is used by each capsule across all receptive fields. Each primary capsule sees all of the lower-layer outputs whose fields overlap with the center of the field in the primary layer. Each primary capsule output (for a particular field) is an 8-dimensional vector.\n\nA second, digit capsule layer has one 16-dimensional capsule for each digit (0-9). Dynamic routing connects (only) primary and digit capsule layers. A [32x6x6] x 10 weight matrix controls the mapping between layers.\n\nCapsnets are hierarchical, in that each lower-level capsule contributes significantly to only one higher-level capsule.\n\nHowever, replicating learned knowledge remains valuable. To achieve this, a capsnet's lower layers are convolutional, including hidden capsule layers. Higher layers thus cover larger regions, while retaining information about the precise position of each object within the region. For low level capsules, location information is “place-coded” according to which capsule is active. Higher up, more and more of the positional information is rate-coded in the capsule's output vector. This shift from place-coding to rate-coding, combined with the fact that higher-level capsules represent more complex objects with more degrees of freedom, suggests that capsule dimensionality increases with level.\n\nHuman vision examines a sequence of focal points (directed by saccades), processing only a fraction of the scene at its highest resolution. Capsnets build on inspirations from cortical minicolumns (also called cortical microcolumns) in the cerebral cortex. A minicolumn is a structure containing 80-120 neurons, with a diameter of about 28-40 µm, spanning all layers in the cerebral cortex. All neurons in the larger minicolumns have the same receptive field, and they output their activations as action potentials or spikes. Neurons within the microcolumn receive common inputs, have common outputs, are interconnected and may constitute a fundamental computational unit of the cerebral cortex.\n\nCapsnets explore the intuition that the human visual system creates a tree-like structure for each focal point and coordinates these trees to recognize objects. However, with capsnets each tree is \"carved\" from a fixed network (by adjusting coefficients) rather than assembled on the fly.\n\nCapsNets are claimed to have four major conceptual advantages over convolutional neural networks (CNN):\n\nPurely convolutional nets cannot generalize to unlearned viewpoints (other than translation). For other affine transformations, either feature detectors must be repeated on a grid that grows exponentially with the number of transformation dimensions, or the size of the labelled training set must (exponentially) expand to encompass those viewpoints. These exponential explosions make them unsuitable for larger problems.\n\nCapsnet's transformation matrices learn the (viewpoint independent) spatial relationship between a part and a whole, allowing the latter to be recognized based on such relationships. However, capsnets assume that each location displays at most one instance of a capsule's object. This assumption allows a capsule to use a distributed representation (its activity vector) of an object to represent that object at that location.\n\nCapsnets use neural activities that vary with viewpoint. They do not have to normalize objects (as in spatial transformer networks) and can even recognize multiply transformed objects. Capsnets can also process segmented objects.\n\n\n"}

There are numerous ways to create an inbred strain and each of these strains are unique. Genetically engineered mice can be considered a coisogenic strain if the only difference between the engineered mouse and a wild-type mouse is a specific locus. Coisogenic strains can be used to investigate the gene function of a certain locus.\n\nCoisogenic strains can be induced chemically or through radiation however, other types of alterations within the genome may also occur. Coisogenic strains may also occur through a spontaneous mutation that occurs in an inbred strain. To create a coisogenic strain through breeding, a mouse with the specific mutation on a locus is mated to an inbred strain (e.g., C57BL/6J) mouse.\n\nThe offspring of the mutated mouse with the inbred strain has a 50% chance of carrying the mutation. From this, the offspring with the mutation can be mated to a heterozygous carrier which then creates offspring with 75% of the genetic background. This backcrossing is then continued until more than 99% is genetic background and the mutated locus is inherited. However, if the specific mutation cannot be passed on, heterozygous animals should be used to breed with the original inbred strain. Full-sib mating are used to maintain coisogenic strains if the specific gene locus is homozygous. However, a regular backcrossing of these coisogenic strains with their standard parental strain is preferred in order to avoid subline divergence.\n"}
{"id": "35006102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35006102", "title": "Death of Luis Andres Colmenares", "text": "Death of Luis Andres Colmenares\n\nLuis Andrés Colmenares Escobar (May 23, 1990 in Villanueva (La Guajira), Colombia - October 31, 2010 in Bogotá D.C., Colombia) was an economics and industrial engineering major student at Los Andes University in Bogotá D.C., Colombia, who was found dead under suspicious circumstances on October 31, 2010, after going to a Halloween party at a club in the popular \"Zona Rosa\". Initial investigations explained Luis Andres' death as a result of a suicide, but almost a year later prosecutors found enough evidence to consider that Colmenares did not commit suicide, but rather was murdered. Ten months after Luis' death, the investigation was re-opened and suspects were named in the case. The prosecutor in this case was removed in a controversial decision by Colombia's Attorney General in May 2012 after constant complaints by counselor for the defense. In June 2012, Carlos Cárdenas was charged with Luis Colmenares' murder and detained.\n\nOn October 30, 2010, Luis Andrés went to a Halloween costume party at a night club in the popular Zona Rosa in Bogotá with his date, Laura Moreno, as well as Jessi Quintero, and several other friends and classmates.\n\nAccording to Moreno and Quintero, they left the party around 3:15 a.m. local time on October 31, 2010. Luis was allegedly very anxious and he went out walked away. Jessi and Laura said they followed him and that Luis claimed he was feeling hungry, so the three of them went to eat while the rest of the group got Laura's SUV from the parking lot. Moreno and Quintero later told law enforcement that, after buying a hot dog, all of a sudden and without any explanation, Colmenares started to run \"like crazy\" towards El Virrey park, which was about 10 minutes walking distance from the hot dog stand. Jessi allegedly stayed at the hot dog stand waiting for her friends while Laura followed Luis. According to Laura, after she tried to stop him several times, Luis jumped into a drain located at El Virrey park. Jessi said that she was picked up by a group of friends, called Luis Andres' cell phone and Laura answered the call. She explained that Laura was frantic and told her that Luis jumped in the water channel (which was less than 50 cm deep) and that she was unable to see him anymore. \n\nSupposedly, the group of friends met Laura at the park and started looking for Luis. After a couple of hours of not finding him, they sought police help at a station nearby. They also alerted Luis' family and a formal search began.\n\nOneida Escobar, mother of Luis Andrés, went to the park to look for her son at 6 a.m. after Laura and Jessi called Luis' brother. She initially started looking in hospitals and police stations. In the meantime, the police and firemen were conducting an exhaustive search around the area without any results. Around 6 p.m. on October 31, 2010, Oneida Escobar begged the firemen and police officer to look again under the drift where, according to Moreno, Colmenares jumped. After finding nothing, the firemen retired. Another call was received around 9 p.m. and when the firemen returned to search again, they found the dead body of Colmenares about 400 feet away from where Moreno said Luis had jumped. The body was taken to the Colombian National Legal Medicine Institute for further evaluation. The result of the first autopsy, showed Colmenares had a grade 3 of alcohol intoxication, which should have impaired him heavily, and confirmed the hypothesis of a suicide. Under this concept, the case was closed.\n\nThe authorities originally ruled Luis Andres' death as a suicide. However, the Colmenares family never accepted that theory. According to the autopsy performed at Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal y Ciencias Forenses, by Leslie del Pilar Rodríguez, Luis Colmenares suffered a violent death. A second autopsy by Máximo Duque, former director of the same Institute, hired by the Colmenares family and research done by Prosecutor Antonio González concluded that the body had eight wounds, none compatible with a fall.\n\nIn September 2011, the case prosecutor and authorities have dismissed the suicide thesis, presented by Laura Moreno and her lawyers, that claimed that Colmenares ran into the water channel and thrown himself into it.\n\nIn October 2011, Laura Moreno and Jessi Quintero were arrested, accused of perjury and covering a crime. According to the prosecutors' office there is \"strong evidence\" that allow them to infer that these two young women participated in the murder of Luis Andrés Colmenares.\n\nOn May 31, 2012, Antonio González, main prosecutor, was removed from the case by Eduardo Montealegre, General Attorney, after frequent clashes with Jaime Granados, defense attorney of Laura Moreno, and substituted by Martha Lucía Zamora. González stated he had full confidence in Zamora's abilities to win the case, that he was proud of delivering a case already in trial while it was almost closed when he received and said he will keep silence about some aspects of the trial because of ethics.\n\nIn June 6, 2012, the prosecution stated that a witness of the events, Wilmer Ayola, came forward, claiming that the night of the events he saw a truck stopping in front of the park where the water channel is located. According to the witness, Luis Colmenares walked away from the truck and Laura Moreno ran after him and slapped Colmenares in the face. Carlos Cárdenas exited the truck and hit Colmenares in the head with a bottle and then Cárdenas and a group of friends kicked the victim while on the ground. After failed efforts by the group to reanimate Colmenares, they carried away the body in the truck. Ayola claimed he came forward because he had been threatened. He also explained that he was afraid because a partner that was with him that night, whom he identified only by the name of Cristian, had disappeared. Ayola added that Cárdenas offered one million pesos (approximately $500) to Cristian in exchange for their silence and that he received part of the money.\n\nThe same day Carlos Cárdenas was detained on charges of aggravated homicide. He claimed it was a false accusation and that there were people interested in damaging his reputation and the well being of his family. The prosecutors stated in the trial files that they had intercepted conversations between Cárdenas and Laura Moreno about his family having an \"important contact\" in the General Attorney's Office so she should keep her calm. The mother of Carlos Cárdenas, María del Pilar Gómez, hired a lawyer, Aidé Acevedo, to press Armando Novoa, Director of the National Prosecution Office, into changing the prosecutor in charge of the case. Both are indicted with obstruction of justice. The prosecution intercepted cell phone calls between both women talking about the best way to change the course of the case.\n\nOn June 14, 2012, Daniel Teleki, attorney for Jessi Quintero, renounced after claiming he and his family had been threatened on social networks. On June 19, 2012, the prosecutor explained that Cristian, the other witness identified by Wilmer Ayola, had been located and that he was looking for protection from the police. Cristian said he had taken pictures of Moreno's truck taken with his cellphone the night of the events.\n\nThe following day, Cárdenas and Morenos' lawyer, Jaime Granados, came forward explaining that Ayola worked as security guard in a building complex far from the site of the events and that records proved he was working there that night.

{"id": "3655000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3655000", "title": "Doneness", "text": "Doneness\n\nDoneness is a gauge of how thoroughly cooked a cut of meat is based on the colour, juiciness and internal temperature when cooked. The gradations of cooking are most often used in reference to beef (especially steak and roasts) but are also applicable to lamb, pork, poultry, veal and seafood (especially fish).\n\nGradations, their description, and the associated temperature ranges vary regionally from cuisine to cuisine and in local practice and terminology. For steaks, common gradations include \"rare\", \"medium rare\", \"medium\", \"medium well\" and \"well done\".\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture recommends an internal temperature of at least for cuts of beef, veal, and lamb in order to prevent foodborne illness, and warns that color and texture indicators are not reliable. The same meats should be thoroughly cooked to when ground or tenderized by cutting, since these processes distribute bacteria throughout the meat.\n\nThe table below is from an American reference book and pertains to beef and lamb.\nThe interior of a cut of meat will still increase in temperature 3–5 °C (5–10 °F) after it is removed from an oven or other heat source. The meat should be allowed to \"rest\" for a suitable amount of time (depending on the size of the cut or steak) before being served, which makes the meat easier to carve and its structure firmer and more resistant to deformation; its water-holding capacity also increases and less liquid is lost from the meat during carving. The whole meat and the center will also continue to cook slightly as the hot exterior continues to warm the comparatively cooler interior. The exception is if the meat has been prepared in a sous-vide process, as it will already be at temperature equilibrium.\nThe temperatures indicated above are the peak temperature in the cooking process, so the meat should be removed from the heat source a few degrees cooler.\n\nAs meat is cooked, it turns from red to pink to gray to brown to black (if burnt), and the amount of red liquid, myoglobin (not blood), and other juices decreases. The color change is due to changes in the oxidation of the iron atom of the heme group in the myoglobin protein: raw meat is red due to myoglobin protein in the muscles, not hemoglobin from blood (which also contains a heme group, hence the color).\nPrior to cooking, the iron atom is in a +2 oxidation state, and bound to a dioxygen molecule (O), with a red color. As cooking proceeds, it loses an electron, moving to a +3 oxidation state, and coordinating with a water molecule (HO), turning brown in the process.\n\nSearing raises the meat’s surface temperature to , yielding browning via different reactions: caramelization of sugars, and the Maillard reaction of amino acids. Raised to a high enough temperature, meat blackens from burning.\n\nWell done cuts, in addition to being brown, are drier and contain few or no juices. Note that searing (cooking the exterior at a high temperature) in no way \"seals in the juices\" – water evaporates at the same or higher rates as unseared meat. Searing does play an important role, however, in browning, a crucial contributor to flavor and texture.\n\n"}

It was written to commemorate the death of composer's daughter, Olga Janáčková. Janáček composed the piece to the text of the Russian teacher Marfa Nikolayevna Veveritsa.\n\nOlga was the first-born child of Leoš and Zdenka Janáček. She was born on 15 August 1882 in Brno. From her childhood, she showed remarkable talent in various arts, though\nnot in music (to the mild disappointment of her father). Her mother later recalled that \"[Olga] \"grew up into a lovely girl. Her skin was delicate and smooth with a peach-bloom to it; like her father, she had a dimple in her chin.\"\" Sadly, her health was poor from an early age, and her physical state brought a lot of anxiety to her parents. At the age of six, she fell ill with inflammation of joints. She recovered, however, the illness negatively affected the functioning of the heart. The situation worsened after her younger brother Vladimír died in November, 1890. Olga remained the only child of her parents, and also the only bond connecting the members of the family.\n\nLeoš Janáček and his daughter, both keen admirers and supporters of Russian culture, were members of the Russian Circle in Brno. In March, 1902, the composer accompanied Olga to Saint Petersburg, in order to deepen her knowledge of Russian language and to let her become familiar with Russian life and society. His brother František worked there as a teacher. A month later, Olga fell ill with typhoid fever. Her health deteriorated rapidly, and she was forced to return to Brno in July of the same year. After her return, she spent some time in Hukvaldy in order to recuperate; however, her illness reappeared with new and worse complications. After months of suffering, Olga Janáčková died on 26 February 1903. \n\nHer parents were completely devastated. Janáček, raving with pain and despair, tore at his hair and cried: \"My soul, my soul!\". Zdenka later remembered their loneliness and despair in her memories: \"We stayed in our dining room alone. Abandoned, silent. I looked at Leoš. He sat in front of me, destroyed, thin, grey-haired.\"\n\nJanáček dedicated two of his works to his daughter. He inscribed the first published piano reduction of the opera \"Jenůfa\", his first masterwork and the composition which later opened him the way to the world opera stages, \"To the memory of Olga Janáčková\".\n\nThe second work, the \"Elegy\", was inspired by their common love of Russian culture. It was composed to original Russian verses written by Marfa Veveritsa, a member of the Russian Circle and a friend of Olga. The composition was completed on 28 April 1903, however, Janáček later (in March, 1904) altered some parts of it. The \"Elegy\" was apparently composed directly to the Russian original, and it was translated later by B. Zavadil. It was premiered after Janáček's death, on 20 December 1930, in the Brno Radio. The manuscript of the composition was not preserved. The duration of the work is approximately 6 minutes.\n\n\n\n"}

Jameson, starring Charles Haid, Angie Dickinson, and Tom Bosley, as well as an all-star ensemble television cast in supporting roles. It is based on the Delta Air Lines Flight 191 plane crash at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on August 2, 1985, as depicted in \"Fire and Rain: A Tragedy in American Aviation\" (1986) by Jerome Greer Chandler.\n\nJerry J. Jameson had become known for his work on \"movie-of-the-week phenomenon and group-jeopardy suspense and terror\", although he also became a specialist in \"one-off\" television and film features.The film was an example of the aviation \"disaster\" film, as well, it also very much fits the additional genre of the complex, heavily character-driven ensemble cast film, exploring the personal dramas and interactions that develop among the passengers and crew as they deal with a deadly onboard emergency. It, however, veers from the traditional format as it is based on a real-life accident.\n\nOn August 2, 1985, Delta Airlines Flight 191, flown by Captain Connors (John Beck) and First Officer Rudy Price (Dick Christie) is preparing to land at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on its single stop, flying from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Los Angeles. Air Traffic controllers advise that a thunderstorm is present. The flight crew surmise that the plane might get washed, but have no other worries about the storm being so near. Passengers such as Lucille Jacobson (Patti Labelle), who is terrified of flying, however, are fearful about landing in a storm. Others, like Marilyn (Gloria Hocking) and Mike Steinberg (Joe Berryman) are thinking more about their California vacation. As the rain pelts down on the plane, there is no warning of an impending crisis.\n\nWithout warning, the plane is slammed into the ground, a mile short of the runway, slicing into a small car on the road, killing William Mayberry (Rudy Young), before skidding onto the field and exploding. Within a minute, all airport fire and emergency units are alerted. Five minutes into the rescue, first responders Jack Ayers (Dean Jones), Beth Mancini (Angie Dickinson), led by Bob Sonnamaker (Charles Haid) are rapidly deployed to the scene. The severed rear section of the plane is where most survivors are found although flight attendants at the front also survive.\n\n\nFilmed at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the film was a docudrama that recreated the events of August 2, 1985, when Delta Airlines Flight 191, a Lockheed L-1011-385-1 TriStar airliner flying from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Los Angeles was coming into Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on its single stop on the route. It unexpectedly flew into an isolated thunderstorm hovering very close to the field. The storm created a dangerous \"wind shear\", or \"microburst\", dashing it into the ground just slightly more than a mile north of the outer perimeter.\n\nThe film incorporated the true-life stories of many of the 152 passengers and 11 crew members on board. In the end, 137 died and 28 survived; one other person on the ground was also killed. The prologue to the film indicated that the crash was one of the worst aircraft mishaps in U.S. history. Up to that time, the circumstances behind it regarding microbursts and wind shears of the kind that brought it down, as well as the kind of thunderstorm that caused them, were unknown. Subsequently, the investigation and review of procedures led to modifications in all big-body civil aircraft whereby their radar could detect the anomalies of major storm systems. At the time, it could only detect the actual presence of the storm itself. A groundbreaking legal action also resulted.\n\nMany firefighters and emergency personnel were portrayed by real first responders from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Some of them had been on duty during the actual rescue following the crash, and were, in effect, portraying themselves.\n\nThe crash of Delta Flight 191 was not only the subject of the film. It was also featured on an episode of \"When Weather Changed History\" on The Weather Channel, and the episode \"Deadly Weather\" of \"Survival in the Sky\". The television series \"Mayday\" (aka \"Air Crash Investigation\" or \"Air Emergency\") on Discovery Channel Canada and National Geographic dramatized it in the episode \"Invisible Killer\" (aka \"Slammed to the Ground\"). It was also shown and discussed in a later \"Mayday\" episode about the American Airlines Flight 1420 accident, which also occurred during landing in bad weather conditions.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

It uses a recursive self-improvement protocol in which it rewrites its own code when it can prove the new code provides a better strategy. The machine was invented by Jürgen Schmidhuber (first proposed in 2003), but is named after Kurt Gödel who inspired the mathematical theories.\n\nThe Gödel machine is often discussed when dealing with issues of meta-learning, also known as \"learning to learn.\" Applications include automating human design decisions and transfer of knowledge between multiple related tasks, and may lead to design of more robust and general learning architectures. Though theoretically possible, no full implementation has been created.\n\nThe Gödel machine is often compared with Marcus Hutter's AIXItl, another formal specification for an artificial general intelligence. Schmidhuber points out that the Gödel machine could start out by implementing AIXItl as its initial sub-program, and self-modify after it finds proof that another algorithm for its search code will be better.\n\nTraditional problems solved by a computer only require one input and provide some output. Computers of this sort had their initial algorithm hardwired. This doesn't take into account the dynamic natural environment, and thus was a goal for the Gödel machine to overcome.\n\nThe Gödel machine has limitations of its own, however. Any formal system that encompasses arithmetic is either flawed or allows for unprovable but true statements. Hence even a Gödel machine with unlimited computational resources must ignore those self-improvements whose effectiveness it cannot prove.\n\nThere are three variables that are particularly useful in the run time of the Gödel machine.\n\n\n\n\nAt any given time formula_1, where formula_11, the goal is to maximize future success or utility. A typical \"utility function\" follows the pattern formula_12:\n\nwhere formula_14 is a real-valued reward input (encoded within formula_15) at time formula_1, formula_17 denotes the\nconditional expectation operator with respect to some possibly unknown distribution formula_18 from a\nset formula_19 of possible distributions (formula_19 reflects whatever is known about the possibly probabilistic\nreactions of the environment), and the above-mentioned formula_21 is a function of state formula_22 which uniquely identifies the current cycle . Note that we take into account the possibility of extending the expected lifespan through appropriate actions .\n\nThe nature of the six proof-modifying instructions below makes it impossible\nto insert an incorrect theorem into proof, thus trivializing proof verification.\n\nAppends the n-th axiom as a theorem to the current theorem sequence. Below is the initial axiom scheme:\n\n\nTakes in the index \"k\" of an inference rule (such as Modus tollens, Modus ponens), and attempts to apply it to the two previously proved theorems \"m\" and \"n\". The resulting theorem is then added to the proof.\n\nDeletes the theorem stored at index \"m\" in the current proof. This helps to mitigate storage constraints caused by redundant and unnecessary theorems. Deleted theorems can no longer be referenced by the above apply-rule function.\n\nReplaces \"switchprog\" \"S\", provided it is a non-empty substring of \"S\".\n\nVerifies whether the goal of the proof search has been reached. A target theorem states\nthat given the current axiomatized utility function \"u\" (Item 1f), the utility of a switch from\n\"p\" to the current switchprog would be higher than the utility of continuing the execution of\n\"p\" (which would keep searching for alternative switchprogs). This is demonstrated in the below image:\n\nTakes in two arguments, \"m\" and \"n\", and attempts to convert the contents of \"S\" into a theorem.\n\nThe initial input to the Gödel machine is the representation of a\nconnected graph with a large number of nodes linked by\nedges of various lengths. Within given time \"T\" it should find\na cyclic path connecting all nodes. The only real-valued\nreward will occur at time \"T\". It equals 1 divided by the\nlength of the best path found so far (0 if none was found).\nThere are no other inputs. The by-product of maximizing\nexpected reward is to find the shortest path findable within\nthe limited time, given the initial bias.\n\nProve or disprove as quickly as possible that all even integer > 2 are the sum of\ntwo primes (Goldbach’s conjecture). The reward is 1/\"t\", where \"t\" is the time required to produce and verify the first\nsuch proof.\n\nA cognitive robot that needs at least 1 liter of gasoline per hour interacts with a partially unknown\nenvironment, trying to find hidden, limited gasoline depots to occasionally refuel its tank. It is rewarded in proportion\nto its lifetime, and dies after at most 100 years or as soon as its tank is empty or it falls off a cliff, and so on.\nThe probabilistic environmental reactions are initially unknown but assumed to be sampled from the axiomatized Speed Prior, according to which hard-to-compute environmental reactions are unlikely. This permits a computable strategy for making near-optimal predictions. One by-product of maximizing expected reward is to maximize expected lifetime.\n\n\n"}

She served with the British, capturing several privateers and other vessels, and was at the Battle of Groix. She disappeared in the Caribbean in 1801, presumably having foundered.\n\n\"Babet\" was built at Le Havre, one of a two-ship \"Prompte\" class of 20-gun corvettes built to a design by Joseph-Marie-Blaise Coulomb.\n\nIn the Bay of Biscay, on 18 May 1793, Captain Andrew Snape Douglas's captured her sister, \"Prompte\", which the Royal Navy took into service as HMS \"Prompte\". \"Babet\" was laid down in September 1792, fitted out in May 1793 and launched on 12 December 1793.\n\nHer commander from 9 January 1793 to October was \"lieutenant de vaisseau\" Rolland. Rolland's replacement on 23 October was \"enseigne de vaisseau non entretenu\" Pierre-Joseph-Paul Belhomme.\n\n\"Babet\"s French career was brief. Under Belhomme's command she sailed from Havre to Cherbourg via La Hogue. She then cruised the Channel before sailing from Honfleur to Cherbourg, on to Brest, and returning to Cancale. She was part of a squadron consisting of two frigates and another corvette that a British squadron under John Borlase Warren engaged off the Île de Batz in the action of 23 April 1794. and captured \"Babet\" and brought her into Portsmouth, arriving on 30 April. The action had cost \"Babet\" some 30 to 40 of her crew killed and wounded. \"Flora\" one man killed and three wounded; \"Arethusa\" had three men killed and five wounded.\n\n\"Babet\" was registered for service on 19 June 1794, and was commissioned in December that year under Captain the Honourable John Murray, for service with Lord Howe's fleet. Captain Joshua Mulock replaced Murray in April 1795 while \"Babet\" was being fitted for service at Portsmouth, a process completed on 10 May that year, having cost £2,544. Captain Edward Codrington replaced Mulock; \"Babet\" was Codrington's first command after he had made post captain.\n\nCodrington then sailed \"Babet\" to join Lord Bridport's fleet. On 23 June 1795 she was with the fleet at the battle of Groix. In 1847, the Admiralty awarded any remaining survivors who claimed it, the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"23rd June 1795\".\n\nCaptain William Lobb replaced Codrington in December 1795 and sailed \"Babet\" to the Leeward Islands in February the following year. There \"Babet\" was present at the capture of Demerara on 23 April, and the capture of Berbice on 2 May 1796.\n\nIn July 1796, \"Babet\", \"Prompte\", and captured the \"Catherina Christina\" in July 1796. At some point \"Babet\" sailed in company with \"Prompte\" and the two vessels captured the Danish brig \"Eland Fanoe\". On 23 July, \"Scipio\", \"Babet\", \"Pique\" and \"Prompte\" shared in the capture of the \"Ariel\" and the \"Zee Nymphe\".\n\nOn 16 September , \"Scipio\" and \"Babet\" captured the \"John and Mary\". The first, fourth and fifth-class shares of the prize money were shared, by agreement, with and \"Prompte\". \"Thorn\" captured the schooner \"Abigail\" on 24 September.

Between 25 July and 5 October \" Babet\" captured three merchant vessels:\n\nThen on 16 January 1798 \"Babet\"s boats captured the French schooner \"Désirée\". The schooner was sailing towards \"Babet\" as \"Babet\" was sailing between Martinique and Dominique. As soon as the schooner realized that \"Babet\" was a British warship she attempted to escape. The wind failed and the schooner then took to her sweeps. Lieutenant Pym of \"Babet\" took 24 men in her pinnace and launch and went after the schooner. After rowing several leagues the boats closed to within range of their cannon, which they then commenced to fire. The British closed on their quarry despite a strong counter-fire. The British then boarded \"Désirée\" and took her. She was armed with six guns and had a crew of 46 men. The British lost one man killed and five wounded; the French had three men killed and 15 wounded. \"Désirée\" was six days out of Guadeloupe and had taken one American brig that had been sailing from St. Vincent to Boston.\n\n\"Babet\" was refitted at Portsmouth between July and December 1798 at a cost of £5,194. Then, in December she recaptured the American ship \"Helena\".\n\nOn 18 and 19 January 1799, \"Babet\" captured two French fishing vessels, \"Deux Freres Unis\", with a cargo of herring, and the \"Jacques Charles\". On 3 June \"Babet\" was in company with when they captured the John. Then on 24 June they captured the ship \"Weloverdagt\".\n\nThen \"Babet\" took part in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799. There she briefly served as Vice-Admiral Andrew Mitchell's flagship in the Zuider Zee. On 28 August 1799, the fleet captured several Dutch hulks and ships in the New Diep, in Holland. \"Babet\" was listed among the vessels qualifying to share in the prize money.

{"id": "404084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=404084", "title": "Hebbian theory", "text": "Hebbian theory\n\nHebbian theory is a neuroscientific theory claiming that an increase in synaptic efficacy arises from a presynaptic cell's repeated and persistent stimulation of a postsynaptic cell. It is an attempt to explain synaptic plasticity, the adaptation of brain neurons during the learning process. It was introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book \"The Organization of Behavior.\" The theory is also called Hebb's rule, Hebb's postulate, and cell assembly theory. Hebb states it as follows:\n\nLet us assume that the persistence or repetition of a reverberatory activity (or \"trace\") tends to induce lasting cellular changes that add to its stability. ... When an axon of cell \"A\" is near enough to excite a cell \"B\" and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that \"A\"s efficiency, as one of the cells firing \"B\", is increased.\n\nThe theory is often summarized as \"Cells that fire together wire together.\" This summary, however, should not be taken too literally. Hebb emphasized that cell \"A\" needs to \"take part in firing\" cell \"B\", and such causality can occur only if cell \"A\" fires just before, not at the same time as, cell \"B\". This important aspect of causation in Hebb's work foreshadowed what is now known about spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which requires temporal precedence.\n\nThe theory attempts to explain associative or Hebbian learning, in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells. It also provides a biological basis for errorless learning methods for education and memory rehabilitation. In the study of neural networks in cognitive function, it is often regarded as the neuronal basis of unsupervised learning.\n\nHebbian theory concerns how neurons might connect themselves to become engrams. Hebb's theories on the form and function of cell assemblies can be understood from the following:\n\nThe general idea is an old one, that any two cells or systems of cells that are repeatedly active at the same time will tend to become 'associated', so that activity in one facilitates activity in the other.\n\nHebb also wrote:\nWhen one cell repeatedly assists in firing another, the axon of the first cell develops synaptic knobs (or enlarges them if they already exist) in contact with the soma of the second cell.\n\nGordon Allport posits additional ideas regarding cell assembly theory and its role in forming engrams, along the lines of the concept of auto-association, described as follows:\n\nIf the inputs to a system cause the same pattern of activity to occur repeatedly, the set of active elements constituting that pattern will become increasingly strongly interassociated. That is, each element will tend to turn on every other element and (with negative weights) to turn off the elements that do not form part of the pattern. To put it another way, the pattern as a whole will become 'auto-associated'. We may call a learned (auto-associated) pattern an engram.\n\nHebbian theory has been the primary basis for the conventional view that, when analyzed from a holistic level, engrams are neuronal nets or neural networks.\n\nWork in the laboratory of Eric Kandel has provided evidence for the involvement of Hebbian learning mechanisms at synapses in the marine gastropod \"Aplysia californica\".\n\nExperiments on Hebbian synapse modification mechanisms at the central nervous system synapses of vertebrates are much more difficult to control than are experiments with the relatively simple peripheral nervous system synapses studied in marine invertebrates. Much of the work on long-lasting synaptic changes between vertebrate neurons (such as long-term potentiation) involves the use of non-physiological experimental stimulation of brain cells. However, some of the physiologically relevant synapse modification mechanisms that have been studied in vertebrate brains do seem to be examples of Hebbian processes. One such study reviews results from experiments that indicate that long-lasting changes in synaptic strengths can be induced by physiologically relevant synaptic activity working through both Hebbian and non-Hebbian mechanisms.\n\nFrom the point of view of artificial neurons and artificial neural networks, Hebb's principle can be described as a method of determining how to alter the weights between model neurons. The weight between two neurons increases if the two neurons activate simultaneously, and reduces if they activate separately. Nodes that tend to be either both positive or both negative at the same time have strong positive weights, while those that tend to be opposite have strong negative weights.\n\nThe following is a formulaic description of Hebbian learning: (note that many other descriptions are possible)\n\nwhere formula_2 is the weight of the connection from neuron formula_3 to neuron formula_4 and formula_5 the input for neuron formula_4. Note that this is pattern learning (weights updated after every training example). In a Hopfield network, connections formula_2 are set to zero if formula_8 (no reflexive connections allowed). With binary neurons (activations either 0 or 1), connections would be set to 1 if the connected neurons have the same activation for a pattern.\n\nAnother formulaic description is:\n\nwhere formula_2 is the weight of the connection from neuron formula_3 to neuron formula_4, formula_13 is the number of training patterns, and formula_14 the formula_15th input for neuron formula_4. This is learning by epoch (weights updated after all the training examples are presented). Again, in a Hopfield network, connections formula_2 are set to zero if formula_8 (no reflexive connections).\n\nA variation of Hebbian learning that takes into account phenomena such as blocking and many other neural learning phenomena is the mathematical model of Harry Klopf. Klopf's model reproduces a great many biological phenomena, and is also simple to implement.\n\nHebb's Rule is often generalized as\n\nor the change in the formula_20th synaptic weight formula_21 is equal to a learning rate formula_22 times the formula_20th input formula_24 times the postsynaptic response formula_25. Often cited is the case of a linear neuron,\n\nand the previous section's simplification takes both the learning rate and the input weights to be 1. This version of the rule is clearly unstable, as in any network with a dominant signal the synaptic weights will increase or decrease exponentially. However, it can be shown that for \"any\" neuron model, Hebb's rule is unstable. Therefore, network models of neurons usually employ other learning theories such as BCM theory, Oja's rule, or the Generalized Hebbian Algorithm.\n\nNeurons also exhibit plasticity in their intrinsic excitability (intrinsic plasticity).\n\nDespite the common use of Hebbian models for long-term potentiation, there exist several exceptions to Hebb's principles and examples that demonstrate that some aspects of the theory are oversimplified. One of the most well-documented of these exceptions pertains to how synaptic modification may not simply occur only between activated neurons A and B, but to neighboring neurons as well. This is due to how Hebbian modification depends on retrograde signaling in order to modify the presynaptic neuron. The compound most commonly identified as fulfilling this retrograde transmitter role is nitric oxide, which, due to its high solubility and diffusibility, often exerts effects on nearby neurons. This type of diffuse synaptic modification, known as volume learning, counters, or at least supplements, the traditional Hebbian model.\n\nHebbian learning and spike-timing-dependent plasticity have been used in an influential theory of how mirror neurons emerge. Mirror neurons are neurons that fire both when an individual performs an action and when the individual sees or hears another perform a similar action. The discovery of these neurons has been very influential in explaining how individuals make sense of the actions of others, by showing that, when a person perceives the actions of others, the person activates the motor programs which they would use to perform similar actions. The activation of these motor programs then adds information to the perception and helps predict what the person will do next based on the perceiver's own motor program. A challenge has been to explain how individuals come to have neurons that respond both while performing an action and while hearing or seeing another perform similar actions.\n\nChristian Keysers and David Perrett suggested that as an individual performs a particular action, the individual will see, hear, and feel himself perform the action. These re-afferent sensory signals will trigger activity in neurons responding to the sight, sound, and feel of the action. Because the activity of these sensory neurons will consistently overlap in time with those of the motor neurons that caused the action, Hebbian learning would predict that the synapses connecting neurons responding to the sight, sound, and feel of an action and those of the neurons triggering the action should be potentiated. The same is true while people look at themselves in the mirror, hear themselves babble, or are imitated by others. After repeated experience of this re-afference, the synapses connecting the sensory and motor representations of an action would be so strong that the motor neurons would start firing to the sound or the vision of the action, and a mirror neuron would have been created.\n\nEvidence for that perspective comes from many experiments that show that motor programs can be triggered by novel auditory or visual stimuli after repeated pairing of the stimulus with the execution of the motor program (for a review of the evidence, see Giudice et al., 2009). For instance, people who have never played the piano do not activate brain regions involved in playing the piano when listening to piano music. Five hours of piano lessons, in which the participant is exposed to the sound of the piano each time he presses a key is proven sufficient to trigger activity in motor regions of the brain upon listening to piano music when heard at a later time. Consistent with the fact that spike-timing-dependent plasticity occurs only if the presynaptic neuron's firing predicts the post-synaptic neuron's firing, the link between sensory stimuli and motor programs also only seem to be potentiated if the stimulus is contingent on the motor program.\n\n\n\n"}

During his time in office, he was an opponent of the Israeli occupation of Palestine, and aligned himself with the Palestinian cause.\n\nOn 20 July 1947, he was ordained a priest of the Basilian Alepian Order. On 30 July 1965, he was appointed archbishop and consecrated.\n\nOn 18 August 1974 he was arrested by security forces of Israel for smuggling weapons into the West Bank in a Mercedes sedan. He was subsequently convicted by Israeli Martial court of using his diplomatic status to smuggle arms to the Palestine Liberation Army and sentenced to 12 years in prison.\n\nMaximos V, the patriarch of the Melkite Church, was a vocal critic of Capucci's imprisonment. He was quoted as saying, \"Is this Bishop reprehensible if he thought it was his duty to bear arms? If we go back in history we find other bishops who smuggled weapons, gave their lives and committed other illegal actions to save Jews from Nazi occupation. I do not see why a man who is ready to save Arabs should be condemned.\" Maximos also asserted that Israel had entered East Jerusalem illegally and against United Nations resolutions.\n\nCapucci was among the prisoners whose release was demanded by Palestinian hijackers of the Kfar Yuval hostage crisis in 1975, and of German and Palestinian hijackers of Air France Flight 139 (the Entebbe hostage crisis), in 1976.\n\nHe was released two years later, in 1978, due to intervention by the Vatican, after having served four years of the 12-years sentence.\n\nCapucci played a key role during the Iran hostage crisis. He made several visits to the hostages, and in early May 1980 he obtained the release of the bodies of the American soldiers who had died in the refueling accident during the rescue mission. Capucci also negotiated an agreement for the release of the hostages, but the plan collapsed because the French press published the story before the agreement had been approved by Iran's Parliament.\n\nAn opponent of the Iraq War, Capucci wrote the foreword for the book \"Neo-Conned!: Just War Principles a Condemnation of War in Iraq\", by John Sharpe.\n\nIn 2009, Capucci was on a Lebanese ship bound for Gaza which was seized by Israeli forces when the ship attempted to violate the Israeli naval blockade.\n\nIn May 2010, Capucci participated in the Free Gaza Movement's aid flotilla to the Gaza Strip (see also Gaza flotilla raid). He was a passenger on , which was seized in the early hours of Monday, 31 May, by the Israeli Navy, with nine people killed and many injured. He was held in Beersheba prison and deported. During a reception for the return of the \"Mavi Marmara\" to Istanbul, he gave a speech to the assembly.\n\nThe governments of Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Syria have honored Capucci with postage stamps.\n\nOn 14 June 2009 he spoke at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) convention's annual Palestine Luncheon.\n\nOn 1 January 2017, the Vatican announced that Capucci had died in Rome, aged 94.\n\n"}

He achieved the rank of Field Marshal and died at the Battle of Stockach.\n\nThe third son of a cadet branch of the House of Fürstenberg, at his birth his chances of inheriting the family title of \"Fürst zu Fürstenberg\" were slight; he was prepared instead for a military career, and a tutor was hired to teach him the military sciences. He entered the Habsburg military in 1777, at the age of seventeen years, and was a member of the field army in the short War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–79). His career progressed steadily during the Habsburg War with the Ottoman Empire. In particular he distinguished himself at Šabac in 1790, when he led his troops in storming the fortress on the Sava river.\n\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, he fought with distinction again for the First Coalition, particularly at Ketsch and Frœschwiller, and in 1796 at Emmendingen, Schliengen and Kehl. He was stationed at key points to protect the movements of the Austrian army. With a force of 10,000, he defended the German Rhineland at Kehl, and reversed a bayonet assault by French troops at Bellheim; his troops also overran Speyer without any losses. By the end of the War of the First Coalition, at the age of 35, he had achieved the rank of Field Marshal. During the War of the Second Coalition, he fought in the first two battles of the German campaign, at Ostrach on 21 March 1799, and at Stockach on 25 March 1799. At the latter action while leading a regiment of grenadiers, he was hit by French case shot and knocked off his horse. He died shortly afterward.\n\nAs the third son of a cadet (junior) branch of the Fürstenberg princely family, Karl Aloys was prepared for a military career. His tutor, Lieutenant Ernst, was in active service in the Habsburg military, and took six-year-old Karl Aloys on maneuvers with him. In this way, he learned as a child the Habsburg military manual, and came into contact with important military men who later furthered his education and career; he also acquired an honorary rank as \"Kreis-Obristen\", or Colonel of the Imperial Circle, by the time he was ten years old. As a youth, in 1776, he met the Habsburg war minister Count Franz Moritz von Lacy and Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon; he was also invited to dine with Emperor Joseph II. He started his service in 1777 as a \"Fähnrich\" (ensign) in the Habsburg military organization. He saw his first field service during the War of the Bavarian Succession (1777–78), although he was not involved in any battles.\n\nIn 1780, at the age of twenty years, he was promoted to captain, and assigned to the 34th Infantry Regiment, also known as the \"Anton Esterházy\", named for Paul II Anton Esterházy, the general of cavalry, field marshal of the Seven Years' War, and ambassador to Britain. While he was assigned to this unit, he participated in the border conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburgs, 1787–92, and stormed the fortress at Šabac (German: \"Schabatz\") on the Sava River in Serbia on 27 April 1788. For his action at Šabac, he was personally commended by the Emperor; on the following day, he was promoted to major and given command of a grenadier battalion.\n\nOn 1 January 1790, at Laudon's explicit request, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was promoted to major general; at the end of June of that year, he received the coveted position of second colonel of the 34th Infantry Regiment \"Anton Esterhazy\", where he served as the executive officer for Antal, Prince Esterházy de Galántha, the 34th Hungarian Regiment's Colonel and Proprietor. This was a customary appointment in which a less prominent officer completed the day-to-day administrative duties of the Colonel and Proprietor, who was usually a noble and was often posted in a different assignment, sometimes a different staff location. Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg also received the confraternal Order of Saint Hubert from the Duke of Bavaria and married the \"elegant\" Princess Elisabeth of Thurn und Taxis (1767–1822), that year.\n\nWhile Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg fought for the Habsburg cause in Serbia, in France, a coalition of the clergy and the professional and bourgeois class—the First and Third estates—led a call for reform of the French government and the creation of a written constitution. Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the French Revolution as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he considered the situation surrounding his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her children, with greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French \"émigré\" nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In the War of the First Coalition (1792–1797), France opposed most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn the early days of the French Revolutionary Wars, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg remained as brigade commander of a small Austrian corps, approximately 10,000 men, under the overall command of Anton, Prince Esterházy. He was stationed in the Breisgau, a Habsburg territory between the Black Forest and the Rhine. This location between the forested mountains and the river included two important bridgeheads across the river which offered access to southwestern Germany, the Swiss Cantons, or north-central Germany. His brigade defended Kehl, a small village immediately across the Rhine from Strasbourg, but most of the action in 1792 occurred further north, in present-day Belgium, near the cities of Speyer and Trier, and at Frankfurt on the Main River.\n\nIn the second year of the war, Fürstenberg was transferred to the cavalry of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser, in the Army of the Upper Rhine, and placed in charge of the advance guard near Speyer, which was still held by the French. On 30 March, he crossed the Rhine by Ketsch at the head of the advance guard, which included 9,000 men. He took the city of Speyer on 1 April, in the absence of the commander of the city, Adam-Philippe de Custine, who was away with most of his troops; those that remained behind simply abandoned the city. On the following day, Fürstenberg occupied the town of Germersheim. His first combat action of the war occurred on 3 April, when Custine's infantry attacked him in a bayonet charge near the villages of Bellheim, Hördt and Leimersheim, and afterward at Landau and Lauterburg. During these attacks, he lost all the ground he had gained in the days before. After these events, he was again transferred, this time to the command of the Regiment \"Count von Kavanagh\", where he continued to distinguish himself during the French counter-offensive of October–November 1793. In the action around Geidertheim, on the Zorn River, he assisted Lieutenant Field Marshal Gabriel Anton, Baron Splény de Miháldy, in repelling a French counter-attack. Shortly afterward, he became very ill and, in December 1793, was sent to the Hagenau to recover. On 22 December, he rejoined Wurmser's Corps for the Battle of Froeschwiller against Lazare Hoche and Charles Pichegru. After the French retreated over the Rhine at Hüningen, near Basel, he directed the construction of its new fortifications.\n\nIn June 1796, Fürstenberg commanded a division of four infantry battalions, 13 artillery pieces, and the \"Freikorps\" (Volunteers) \"Gyulay\" and secured the Rhine corridor between Kehl and Rastatt. On 26 June 1796, the French troops of the Army of the Rhine-and-Moselle crossed the Rhine and chased the Swabian Circle's military contingent out of Kehl. In June 1796, Archduke Charles added the contingent to Fürstenberg's command, making him the Swabian's \"Feldzeugmeister\", or General of Infantry. Fürstenberg's troops defended the imperial line at the town of Rastatt until support troops arrived, and they could make an orderly withdrawal into the Upper Danube Valley. The Swabian contingent was demobilized in July, and Fürstenberg returned to the command of Austrian regulars during the Austrian counter-offensive. At the Battle of Emmendingen on 19 October 1796, his leadership was again instrumental in an Austrian victory. General Jean Victor Marie Moreau's Army of the Rhine-and-Moselle sought to retain a foothold on the eastern side of the Rhine, following his retreat from southwestern Germany west of the Black Forest. Fürstenberg held Kenzingen, north of Riegel on the Elz River. Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was ordered to feint against Riegel, to protect the primary Austrian positions at Rust and Kappel.\n\nIn the Battle of Schliengen (24 October 1796), Fürstenberg commanded the second column of the Austrian force, which included nine battalions of infantry and 30 squadrons of cavalry; with these, he overwhelmed the force of General of Division Gouvion Saint-Cyr, holding his position to prevent the French force from retreating north on the Rhine. While Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, engaged the main Austrian force at Kehl, Archduke Charles entrusted to Lieutenant Field Marshal Fürstenberg the command of the forces besieging Hüningen, which included two divisions with 20 battalions of infantry and 40 squadrons of cavalry. Charles' confidence in his young field marshal was well-placed. On 27 November, Fürstenberg's chief engineer opened and drained the water-filled moat protecting the French fortifications. Fürstenberg offered the commander of the bridgehead, General of Brigade Jean Charles Abbatucci, the opportunity to surrender, which he declined. In the night of 30 November to 1 December, Fürstenberg's force stormed the bridgehead twice, but was twice repulsed. In one of these attacks, the French commander was mortally wounded and died on 3 December. Fürstenberg maintained the Siege of Kehl while Archduke Charles engaged the stronger French force to the north of Kehl.\n\nAfter the French capitulation at Kehl (10 January 1797), Fürstenberg received additional forces with which he could end the siege at Hüningen. He ordered the reinforcement of the ring of soldiers surrounding Hüningen and, on 2 February 1797, the Austrians prepared to storm the bridgehead. General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour, the new French commander, pre-empted what would have been a costly attack, by offering to surrender the bridge. On 5 February, Fürstenberg finally took possession of the bridgehead. Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, appointed him as Colonel and Proprietor of the 36th Infantry Regiment, which bore his name until his death in battle in 1799.\n\nThe Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, but in northern Italy, they could neither lift nor escape the siege at Mantua. The efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces to the border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, leading to the formal Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797. Austria withdrew from the territories the army had fought so hard to acquire, including the strategic river crossings at Hüningen and Kehl, as well as key cities further north.\n\nWhen the war ended, Fürstenberg stayed at the Donaueschingen estate of his cousin, Karl Joachim Aloys, who had recently inherited the family title as \"Fürst zu Fürstenberg\". Later in 1797, he traveled to Prague and remained with his family until May 1798, when he received a posting to a new division in Linz. His daughter, Maria Anna, was born after he left, on 17 September 1798.\n\nDespite the longed-for peace, tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies, either separately or jointly. Ferdinand IV of Naples refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the Parthenopaean Republic. A republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by the French Republic which offered military support, led to the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation and the establishment of the Helvetic Republic. On his way to Egypt in Spring 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and removed the Hospitallers from their possessions. This angered Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. The ongoing French occupation of Malta angered the British, who dedicated themselves to ejecting the French garrison at Valletta. The French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the British actually discussed this possibility.\nAs winter broke on 1 March 1799, General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his 25,000-man Army of the Danube crossed the Rhine at Kehl. The Army of the Danube met little resistance as it advanced through the Black Forest and eventually took a flanking position on the north shore of Lake Constance. Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. His was a preemptive strike. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Archduke Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could not only prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, but could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.\n\nAt the outbreak of hostilities in March 1799, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was with his troops in Bavarian territory, just north of the free and Imperial city of Augsburg. When news reached the Austrian camp that the French had crossed the Rhine, Charles ordered the imperial army to advance west. Fürstenberg moved his troops toward Augsburg, crossing the Lech River.\n\nThe French advanced guard arrived in Ostrach on 8–9 March, and over the next week skirmished with the Austrian forward posts, while the rest of the French army arrived. Jourdan disposed his 25,000 troops along a line from Salem Abbey and Lake Constance to the Danube river, centered in Ostrach. He established his command headquarters at the imperial city of Pfullendorf, overlooking the entire Ostrach valley. Jourdan was expecting Dominique Vandamme's troops to arrive in time to support his far north flank near the river, but Vandamme had gone to Stuttgart to investigate a rumored presence of Austrian troops there and had not rejoined the main army. Consequently, the French left flank, under command of Gouvion Saint-Cyr, was thinly manned. Jourdan thought he had more time, expecting Charles would need still three or four days to move his troops across the Lech, and march to Ostrach, but by the middle of Holy Week in 1799, more than a third of Charles' army, 48,000 mixed troops, was positioned in a formation parallel to Jourdan's, and his 72,000 remaining troops were arrayed with the left wing at Kempten, the center near Memmingen, and the right flank extended to Ulm.\n\nBy 21 March, the French and Austrian outposts overlapped, and skirmishing intensified. Charles had divided his force into four columns. Fürstenberg covered the northern flank of the Archduke's main force. Fürstenberg's force pushed the French out of Davidsweiler, and then advanced on Ruppersweiler and Einhard, 5 kilometers (3 mi) to the northwest of Ostrach. Saint-Cyr did not have the manpower to defend the position, and the entire line fell back to Ostrach, with Fürstenberg's troops pressuring their withdrawal. Fürstenberg's persistent pressure on the French left flank was instrumental in the collapse of the northern part of the French line. After their success in driving the French back from Ostrach, and then from the heights of Pfullendorf, the Austrian forces continued to press the French back to Stockach, and then another five miles or so to Engen.\n\nOn the morning of what they suspected would be the general engagement, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg sought out the field chaplain, and requested the sacraments because, as he told his aide, anything can happen during a battle. Although Ostrach had been a hard-fought battle, at Engen and Stockach, the Austrian and French forces were far more concentrated—more men in a smaller space—than they had been at Ostrach, where the French forces in particular had been stretched thinly on a long line from Lake Constance to north of the Danube. At Stockach, furthermore, Jourdan had all his troops under his direct control, with the possible exception of Dominique Vandamme, who was maneuvering his small force of cavalry and light infantry into position to attempt a flanking action on the far right Austrian flank.\n\nIn the course of the battle, Jourdan's forces were supposed to engage in simultaneous attacks on the left, center and right of the Austrian line. On the French right, Soulham's and Ferino's Corps met with strong resistance and were stopped; on the French left, Lefebvre's troops charged with such force that the Austrians were pushed back. Having stopped Soulham's and Ferino's assault, Charles had troops available to counter Lefebvre's force. At that point, Vandamme's men moved into action. Because Soulham's assault at the center had been stalled, Charles still had enough men to turn part of his force to fight this new threat, but the Austrians were hard pressed and the action furious. At one point, Charles attempted to lead his eight battalions of Hungarian grenadiers into action, to the dismay of the old soldiers. Fürstenberg reportedly said that while he lived, he would not leave this post (at the head of the grenadiers) and the Archduke should not dismount and fight. As Fürstenberg led the Hungarian grenadiers into the battle, he was cut down by a canister and case shot employed by the French. Although he was carried alive off the field, he died almost immediately. Charles ultimately did lead his grenadiers into battle, and reportedly his personal bravery rallied his troops to push back the French. After the battle, someone removed Fürstenberg's wedding ring and returned it to his wife in Prague, with news of his death; Fürstenberg was buried at the battlefield cemetery in Stockach, and his cousin erected a small monument there, but in 1857, his body was moved to the family cemetery, \"Maria Hof\" at Neudingen, near Donaueschingen.\n\nUpon the death of Prosper Ferdinand, Count Fürstenberg, in the War of the Spanish Succession, in 1704 the Fürstenberg inheritance was divided between the count's two youngest sons, Joseph Wilhelm Ernst and Wilhelm Egon; the eldest son was an ecclesiastic. The family of Fürstenberg was raised to princely status 2 February 1716, with the elevation of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst, as the first Prince (\"Fürst\") of Fürstenberg (German: \"Fürst zu Fürstenberg\"). The first prince had three sons, Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk (1728–1783), Karl Borromäus Egon (1729–1787), and Prosper Maria, who died in infancy. The title passed through the line of the first son, Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk (as second prince), to his son Joseph Maria Benedikt Karl (third prince, who died in 1796) and then to another son of the second prince, Karl Joachim Aloys (fourth prince). The last son of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst died in 1803 without male issue. Consequently, the title passed to the male line of first prince's second son. This son, Karl Borromäus Egon, had died in 1787. \nKarl Borromäus Egon's oldest son, Joseph Maria Wenzel (16 August 1754 – 14 July 1759), died as a small child. The second son, Philipp Nerius Maria (Prague, 21 October 1755 – 5 June 1790), married in 1779 to his first cousin, Josepha Johanna Benedikta von Fürstenberg (sister of the third and fourth princes), at Donaueschingen. Only one of their sons survived childhood, but died at the age of 15 years. The other children of this second son were all daughters, and thus not eligible to inherit the title Prince of Fürstenberg. Consequently, the title devolved to the agnatic male descendants of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg.\n\nIn 1803, two of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg's children were still living. Karl Egon, as the surviving son, inherited the title Prince of Fürstenberg; he and his eldest sister lived into adulthood and produced families.\n\nChildren of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg and Elizabeth, Princess of Thurn und Taxis, were:\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

He notably had authority over section IV J, charged with the deportation of the Jews, for which Alois Brunner (sent in 1943 by Heinrich Müller) was responsible. His aliases included Charles Bois, Mollemburg, and Bennelburger.\n\nDuring his youth, he spent five years in Paris, in which he learned to speak nearly perfect French. He returned to Germany, was married and began working in his parents' bakery in Berlin. In 1931, Bömelburg became a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party), joining the SA then the SS. In 1933 he joined the Gestapo, in which he became a commissary directing the Kripo in Berlin.\n\nIn 1938 he joined the staff of Joachim von Ribbentrop in Paris. At the start of November, he was put in charge of enquiries into the murder of Ernst vom Rath. When this affair was quickly resolved, he became attached to the German ambassador in Paris, setting up an unofficial Gestapo centre in Paris. He worked in Lyon and Saint-Étienne, making use of his French language ability.\n\nIn January 1939, he was expelled by Antoine Mondanel, the inspector general of the judicial police, for helping extreme-right French organisations and fifth-columnists. He moved to Prague, becoming police counsellor to the Gestapo and the head of its anti-Maquis section. While in Prague, he played a crucial role in Nicholas Winton's rescue of 669 Jewish children who escaped Czechoslovakia at the last moment, in exchange for bribes.\n\nOn 14 June 1940, during the German invasion of France, Bömelburg returned to France in colonel Helmut Knochen's Kommando SD and acted as \"Kommandeur der Sicherheitspolizei\" (\"KdS\", Commander of Security Police). In August he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the SS and had Heinrich Müller name him his personal representative and the head of the Gestapo (section IV of the BdS covering France), with the title of criminal director. His activities during the time he spent in Paris passed from repression and interrogations to the frequent use of torture in the courts by his subordinates, but also fashionable soirées and little gifts offered by Henri Lafont, derived from the black market or from war loot. One of Bömelburg's wishes was to have a poultry farm, and Henri Lafont obliged by giving him a farm near Giverny staffed by his own men. His offices were situated at 11 rue des Saussaies (1940-1942), then 84 Avenue Foch, and his adjutants were \"Sturmbannführer\" Josef Kieffer (criminal counsellor), Heimboldt and Wolf.\n\nIn 1941 he succeeded Rudy de Mérode at 43, avenue Victor-Hugo in Neuilly, in a \"Gasthaus\" (a house reserved for \"forced\" guests), which came to be called villa Boemelburg. He personally recruited agents, with the initial B or Boe. In summer 1941 he made a trip to the unoccupied zone to reactivate pre-war agents, and in the autumn he supervised the inquiry into Paul Collette, who had betrayed Pierre Laval and Marcel Déat. During that year, he also headed up the Red Orchestra Kommando and enacted Operation Funkspiel against the workers' Soviets.\n\nIn autumn 1942 he put \"Aktion Donar\" into effect, and in June 1943 he was the last German senior officer to see Jean Moulin alive. Moulin had been arrested on 21 June at Caluire, and then spent two weeks (25 June to 8 July) at villa Boemelburg, before dying on his train journey to Berlin. In November 1943 Bömelburg reached the age limit and was replaced by Stindt.\n\nBömelburg was transferred to Vichy, where he represented Carl Oberg, and then in June 1944 replaced SS captain Hugo Geissler (killed in an ambush near Murat) as head of the Gestapo in the southern zone of France. On 28 August that year he ensured Marshal Philippe Pétain's safe journey to Sigmaringen, as security-chief, and then on 29 April 1945 authorised Pétain's departure for Switzerland.\n\nIn May 1945, after the German surrender, Bömelburg and his Gestapo chief in Berlin, Heinrich Müller, disappeared and were never recaptured. Bömelburg doctored the papers of a sergeant Bergman, killed in the bombardment, and adopted his identity. He was hired as a gardener near Munich, then promoted to librarian, and also directed a group of active Nazis fleeing to Francoist Spain. At Saint-Sylvestre, in 1946, he slipped on ice, broke his skull and died. Later his son Ralf engraved his name on the family tombstone. He was condemned to death \"in absentia\" on 2 March 1950 by a military tribunal meeting in Lyon, and the Czechoslovak authorities were also seeking him for trial for war crimes.\n\n\n"}

He was the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize for his photograph depicting the 1993 famine in Sudan. He died by suicide at the age of 33. His story is depicted in the 2010 feature film \"The Bang-Bang Club\", in which he was played by Taylor Kitsch.\n\nKevin Carter was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and grew up in a middle-class, whites-only neighborhood. As a child, he occasionally saw police raids to arrest blacks who were illegally living in the area. He said later that he questioned how his parents, a Catholic, \"liberal\" family, could be what he described as 'lackadaisical' about fighting against apartheid.\n\nAfter high school, Carter dropped out of his studies to become a pharmacist and was drafted into the army. To escape from the infantry, he enlisted in the Air Force in which he served four years. In 1980, he witnessed a black mess-hall waiter being insulted. Carter defended the man, resulting in him being badly beaten by the other servicemen. He then went absent without leave, attempting to start a new life as a radio disc-jockey named \"David\". This, however, proved more difficult than he had anticipated. Soon after, he decided to serve out the rest of his required military service. After witnessing the Church Street bombing in Pretoria in 1983, he decided to become a news photographer and journalist.\n\nCarter had started to work as a weekend sports photographer in 1983. In 1984, he moved on to work for the \"Johannesburg Star\", went on exposing the brutality of apartheid.\n\nCarter was the first to photograph a public execution \"necklacing\" by black Africans in South Africa in the mid-1980s. Carter later spoke of the images: \"I was appalled at what they were doing. But then people started talking about those pictures... then I felt that maybe my actions hadn't been at all bad. Being a witness to something this horrible wasn't necessarily such a bad thing to do.\"\n\nIn March 1993, Robert Hadley of the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan offered João Silva the opportunity to travel to Sudan and report about the famine in South Sudan embedding with the rebels in that area's civil war. Silva told Carter, who felt it was an opportunity to expand his freelance career and use work as a way to address personal problems. Operation Lifeline Sudan had been having funding difficulties, and the UN believed that publicizing the area's famine and needs would help aid organizations sustain funding. Silva and Carter were apolitical and desiring only to photograph.\n\nAfter flying to Nairobi, the two found out that new fighting in Sudan would force them to wait in that city indefinitely. During this time, Carter made a day trip with the UN to Juba in the south Sudan to photograph a barge with food aid for the region. Soon afterward, the UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Hadley invited Silva and Carter to fly there with him. Once in Ayod, Silva and Carter separated to shoot photos of famine victims, discussing between themselves the shocking situations they were witnessing. Silva found rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority. Carter joined him. One of the soldiers, who did not speak English, was interested in Carter's wristwatch. Carter gave him the cheap watch as a gift. The soldiers served as their bodyguards.\n\nCarter shot an image of what appeared to be a little girl, fallen to the ground from hunger, while a vulture lurked on the ground nearby. He told Silva he was shocked by the situation he had just photographed, and had chased the vulture away. A few minutes later, Carter and Silva boarded a small UN plane and left Ayod for Kongor.\n\nSold to \"The New York Times\", the photograph first appeared on 26 March 1993, and syndicated worldwide. Hundreds of people contacted the newspaper to ask the fate of the girl. The paper said that according to Carter, \"she recovered enough to resume her trek after the vulture was chased away\" but that it was unknown whether she reached the UN food center.\" In April 1994, the photograph won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography.\n\nIn 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of \"fevers\", according to his family.\n\nIn March 1994 Carter took a photograph of the three Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging members being shot during their abortive invasion of Bophuthatswana just before the South African election. Halfway through the incident, Carter ran out of film, but still got enough pictures to supply newspapers around the world. Eamonn McCabe of \"The Guardian\" said: \"It was a picture that made nearly every front page in the world, the one real photograph of the whole campaign.\"\n\nIn April 1994, Carter's photograph of a starving Sudanese child being eyed by a vulture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography.\n\nOn 24 July 1994, Carter drove to Parkmore near the Field and Study Centre, an area where he used to play as a child, and committed suicide by taping one end of a hose to his pickup truck’s exhaust pipe and running the other end to the driver's side window. He died of carbon monoxide poisoning at the age of 33. Portions of Carter's suicide note read:\n\nThe final line is a reference to his recently deceased colleague Ken Oosterbroek.\n\nThe 1996 song \"Kevin Carter\" by rock band Manic Street Preachers, from their fourth album \"Everything Must Go\", was inspired by Carter's life and suicide. The lyrics were written by Richey Edwards shortly before his own disappearance.\n\n\n"}

Cree bands sympathetic to the Métis cause and with grievances of their own began raiding stores and farms in the western part of the District of Saskatchewan for arms, ammunition and food supplies while civilians fled to the larger settlements and forts of the North-West Territories.\n\nProminent leaders of this uprising were Chief Poundmaker and Chief Big Bear. Poundmaker and his band had a reserve near present-day Cut Knife about 50 km (31 miles) west of Fort Battleford. Big Bear and his band had settled near Frog Lake about 55 km (34 miles) northwest of Fort Pitt but had not yet selected a reserve site. Both bands were signatories of Treaty 6 and were unhappy in the way it was implemented by the Canadian government. The loss of the buffalo and the inadequate rations provided by the Indian agents kept the bands in a continual state of near-starvation.\n\nThe District of Saskatchewan in 1885 was divided into three sub-districts and had a population of 10,595. To the east the Carrot River sub-district with 1,770 people remained quiet. The Prince Albert sub-district located in the centre of the district had a population of 5,373 which included the Southbranch settlements with about 1,300. The Southbranch settlements was the centre of Louis Riel's Provisional Government during the Rebellion. To the west where the Cree uprising led by Poundmaker and Big Bear occurred was the Battleford sub-district with 3,603 people.\n\nThe largest settlement and the capital of the district was Prince Albert with about 800 people followed by Battleford with about 500 people \"divided about equally between French, Métis and English\".\n\nBattleford is located on the Battle River near the North Saskatchewan River. On the south side of the Battle River was the Old Town and on the north side nearest the North Saskatchewan River was the New Town and Fort Battleford.\n\nThe city of North Battleford was founded later in 1905 when the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway main line to Edmonton placed the line on the north side of the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nOn March 28 as news that several Indian bands including Poundmaker's were on their way to Battleford settlers began moving into the nearby North-West Mounted Police post, Fort Battleford which was under the command of Colonel Morris and 25 police. Over the next several days 500 civilians would take refuge within the palisades. Many crossed over an unstable ice bridge on the Battle River leaving most of their possessions behind in the Old Town. During the night of March 29 nearby homesteads were raided their horses and cattle rounded up by the bands.\n\nAlso on the trail to join Poundmaker in Battleford were the Assiniboine from the Eagle Hills approximately 30 km south of Battleford. On March 29 they killed their farm instructor John Payne and raided homesteads on the way killing a farmer by the name of Fremont.\n\nOn March 30 Poundmaker asked for a meeting with the Indian agent J. M. Rae. \nAfter Rae refused to meet with him the combined Battleford bands took food and supplies from the abandoned stores and houses. The next day the bands camped a few miles away bringing with them their looted provisions including cattle and horses then eventually returned to Poundmaker's reserve.\nWhile the New Town was protected by its proximity to the Fort and its cannon the Old Town was not. Every day until the arrival of Colonel Otter's column on April 24 the occupants of the Fort watched as the Old Town about a mile away was plundered. Stolen vehicles and horses carried away the supplies of the Hudson's Bay Company and the other merchants. All the public buildings were sacked including the Battleford Industrial School (located in the Old Government House). Most homes were burned including the imposing home of Judge Charles Rouleau. Just half a dozen were left standing.\n\nOn May 2 Colonel Otter's column attacked Poundmaker's camp at Cut Knife Creek but was forced to retreat to Battleford. Poundmaker prevented his warriors from attacking the retreating troops.\n\nOn May 14 at Eagle Hills a Battleford band captured a wagon train carrying supplies for Colonel Otter's column.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Métis force at the Battle of Batoche and the surrender of Louis Riel to Middleton on May 15 Pitikwahanapiwiyin (Poundmaker) surrendered to General Middleton at Fort Battleford on May 26.\n\nThe nature of the Cree advance on Battleford, like the entire 1885 Rebellion, is a source of historiographical controversy. Historian Douglas Hill characterized the Cree group as a \"war party ... ready to take revenge for a winter of incalculable suffering\" who \"swooped on Battleford, killing six whites\". George F. G. Stanley's writing on the subject indicated that the Cree were not murderous but more haphazard and bumbling: they \"[did] not appear to have in mind an attack upon the town\" but were content with \"prowling around the neighbourhood\". While John L. Tobias says that the Crees tried to demonstrate their \"peaceful intent\" by including women and children in their group, simply took food to sustain themselves after finding the town abandoned, and then withdrew to avoid conflict with the police.\n\n"}
{"id": "54233386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54233386", "title": "Louise Vermilya", "text": "Louise Vermilya\n\nLouise Vermilya (Born July 1868) was a \"black widow\" whose activities spanned the turn of the 20th century. Light was shed on her murders only after she resorted to murdering outside of her immediate family, beginning with the death of policeman Arthur Bissonette. Authorities were alerted and suspicion arose over the peculiar and similar fates experienced by her two husbands, several immediate family members and two associates known to her.\nLouise Vermilya was born Louesa Woolf in Cook County, Illinois, to parents Wilhemina (née Munaroe) and John Woolf, Prussian immigrants. She was the oldest daughter of five girls and third oldest child out of 11 siblings. She married 24 year old Fred Brinkamp on 2 April 1885 at the age of 16 and moved to the village of Barrington within the Cuba township of Lake county in northern Illinois.\n\nThe string of homicides began in 1893, when Vermilya claimed the life of her first husband, Fred Brinkamp, while living on their farm near Barrington, Illinois. The coroner ruled Brinkamp's death to be attributed to a heart attack. Following his death, she inherited $5,000 from a life insurance policy Brinkamp had which named her as the beneficiary. Due to Brinkamp's age at death, no suspicions arose as it was thought to be due to natural causes. Brinkamp left behind six children, two of whom met similar fates to their father shortly after his death. Cora Brinkamp was the first to die at age eight, with her sister Florence following at three and a half years old.\n\nUndertaker E.N. Blocks, who owned a mortuary in Barrington, recalled that Louise enjoyed working around bodies. Despite not being a salaried employee, Vermilya seemed too eager to work in the mortuary with Blocks \"while I never employed her for a couple of years I couldn't keep her out of the office\". Blocks also stated that \"at every death she would seem to hear of it just as soon as I and she would reach the house only a little behind me.\"\n\nVermilya moved to Chicago in 1906 with her minor charges in tow. It was while living in Chicago that Vermilya claimed the life of her stepdaughter, 26 year old Lillian Brinkamp. The coroner, however, ruled her cause of death as \"acute nephritis\". Due to the unusually high number of deaths within the Brinkamp family, they were thought to be cursed.\n\nAround this time, Vermilya remarried to a man named Charles Vermilya, aged 59. Three years later, he died, apparently victim to sudden illness. He left his widow with $1,000 in cash and a home in Crystal Lake, Illinois, ten miles north of Chicago. Her stepson, Harry Vermilya, followed his father in death shortly after quarreling with Louise over the sale of the Crystal Lake estate. No suspicions arose after the deaths, and coincidence was blamed.\n\nThe following year, in 1910, Vermilya inherited $1,200 after the death of her 23-year-old son from her first marriage, Frank Brinkamp. Frank has been married to a widow and divorced her, receiving $1,200 from the divorce proceedings. On his death bed, he voiced suspicion involving his stepmother to his fiancée, Elizabeth Nolan, stating he was \"going the way his father did.\" \n\nUncharacteristically, Vermilya began poisoning acquaintances. Jason Rupert, a railroad fireman, fell ill after dining with Vermilya on January 15, 1910. He died two days later, but was only the first in series of deaths of boarders in Vermilya's home. In February 1910, Vermilya married Richard Smith, a train conductor and boarder at her home. On March 11, 1910, two days after eating a meal prepared by Vermilya, he met a similar fate to Vermilya's prior boarder. His death was determined to be caused by gastritis. Smith was still married at the time of his supposed nuptials to Vermilya. His estranged wife believed that the circumstances surrounding her husband's death were suspicious. She believed that Smith was murdered for one of three reasons, \"either Mrs. Vermilya loved Smith and was afraid that he would desert her, or he was murdered for his money, or C. C. Boysen, the undertaker, thought to be in love with Mrs. Vermilya, was jealous\". While her motive in the earlier deaths of her family members was pursuit of financial gain, they became unclear after the deaths of her boarders, for whom she gained no monetary rewards.\n\nIt wasn't until Arthur Bissonette came to dine with Vermilya did she experience her undoing. While dining with his father at the Vermilya home in October 1911, both of the Bissonettes started experiencing abdominal pain. Homicide detectives became suspicious after questioning Bissonette's father who states he saw Vermilya sprinkling \"white pepper\" over their meals prior to serving them. This led the Chicago Police Department to do an autopsy on Bissonette's body revealing arsenic poisoning. Vermilya was taken into custody soon after its discovery.\n\nThere is some speculation as to whether Bissonette's death was precipitated by financial motives. With Vermilya's assistance, Bissonette was accepted into the Home Guard, a militia-like entity for those men who were unable to qualify for the military. In return, Bissonette was to make a will naming Vermilya as the sole beneficiary of the insurance policy he would carry as a result of this employment. Vermilya was to name him as her beneficiary for the life insurance that she carried after their nuptials. Bissonette did author a will shortly before his death, but named his fiancé who lived in nearby Kankakee, Lydia Rivard, as the beneficiary of his estate. Though Vermilya was listed as the witness, she claimed to have no knowledge of ever signing the document.\n\nOn November 4, Vermilya was rushed to the hospital after playing victim to her own modus operandi. Authorities reported Vermilya had been ingesting the \"white pepper\" since her house arrest on October 28. By November 9, she was reported as being near her death with comorbidities such as valvular heart problems adding to her demise. Vermilya was discharged from the county hospital on November 24, 1911. By December 9, she was stricken with paralysis, which physicians stated was a permanent condition.\n\nNevertheless, Vermilya was required to attend all her court proceedings, and usually did so in a wheelchair. Vermilya was arraigned before Municipal Judge Walker on 6 November 1911 for the death of Arthur Bissonette. On 7 March 1912, nolle prosequi was filed after it had been found that Bissonette had been taking medication containing arsenic. In an effort to expedite court proceedings, a conference was held between the presiding judge, Judge Kersten, attorney Joseph R. Barres, and the prosecutor on the case. The prosecutor was reticent as to the strongest points and the motive in Smith's death stating \"There are several cases as to which Mrs. Vermilya may be tried and I don't want to try her more than once...For that reason, I want to pick out the strongest one and I have concluded the Smith one is the strongest one.\" Vermilya was rearrested and charged for the murder of Richard Smith. Evidence of arsenic poisoning was found in Smith's liver via autopsy conducted by Prof. Walter S. Haines, the Rush Medical College expert chemist. His findings showed \"arsenic in sufficient quantities in the viscera of the two men to cause death.\" Vermilya was taken into custody and detained in the county jail where she attempted suicide again. The trial began on 21 March 1912 and lasted 16 days. The case was resubmitted for trial ten days later, ending in another hung jury as evidence against her was deemed circumstantial.\n\nThere were subsequent difficulties that further complicated the progression of the trial. Juror selection had become an arduous process as men were unsure of if they could inflict the death penalty on a woman as freely as they would on a man. Nearly every man called forward had established a bias based on current newspaper accounts of the crime. A good percentage of these were sure that because of the impression made by the newspaper stories, they could not give a fair verdict. About 50% of those who passed this barrier had a prejudice against circumstantial evidence which necessitated their being excused. Up to this point, the jury had been composed of an all-male panel, who were unable to not only impose a death sentence on a woman, but whose attitudes toward woman defendants in murder cases also came into question. By 12 October 1912, Vermilya was still in custody awaiting trial along with fellow murderess Louisa Lindloff. On 28 June 1913, Vermilya was released on $5,000 bail due to concerns for her continued failing health and exposure to the summer heat in a non-airconditioned jail, pending her trial for the poisoning of Richard Smith.\n\nOn 18 April 1915, a conference was held between the Assistant State's Attorney, Michael Sullivan, and the State Attorney Hoyne regarding continuation of the trial. It was decided that it would be impossible to obtain a conviction on the Smith indictment, with Sullivan remarking \"We could only see that another trial would entail a heavy cost without any assurance of being able to show any strong evidence.\" Per the request of Vermilya's attorney, all charges were dropped. Vermilya led a quiet life following the dismissal of her charges as no further documentation exists of her in local papers past this point.\n\nIt is estimated that Vermilya amassed a total of $15,000 from the nine deaths.\n"}

His life is known primarily through inscriptions.\n\nThe son of Lucius and a member of the Roman tribe \"Camilia\", Carus' career began with his appointment to the \"decemviri stlitibus judicandis\", one of the four boards of the \"vigintiviri\"; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. This was followed by serving as a military tribune, firstly of the Legio VIII Augusta, at the time stationed at \"Argentoratum\" (Strasbourg), then of the Legio IX Hispana, sometime after AD 122. Returning to Rome, Carus began his climb up the series of Republican magistracies: first appointed \"quaestor\" to the Emperor, then Plebeian Tribune before achieving the Praetorship.\n\nReturning to the military sphere, Carus was granted the rank of \"Legatus legionis\", commanding the Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix. Anthony Birley notes this was unusual assignment, for Legio XXX and Legio IX were both stationed in the same province, Germania Inferior, and men were rarely assigned command of a legion in the same army as they had held a tribunate; Birley could only list 14 men with that distinction. He returned to civilian life, serving as curator of the Via Flaminia. His next assignment was as \"Legatus Augusti pro praetore\" (or governor) of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea from AD 142 to 143. In 144, he was appointed suffect consul, and this was followed up with an appointment as imperial \"censitor\" of Gallia Lugdunensis. Finally, Carus was made \"Legatus Augusti pro praetore\", or governor, of Cappadocia.\n\nCarus was a member of the \"Quindecimviri sacris faciundis\", the \"collegium\" of Roman priests entrusted with the care of the Sibylline oracles, and the \"sodales Flaviales\", a less prominent \"collegium\".\n\nCarus' son, also named Lucius Aemilius Carus, was \"Legatus Augusti pro praetore\" of the province of \"Tres Daciae\" in AD 174/175, and suffect consul at some point between 170 and 175.\n\n"}

He served in the British Army in both the First and Second World Wars and was dean of the medical school at St George's Hospital for 20 years. At the age of 64 he became professor of surgery at the University of Khartoum in Sudan, where he maintained the position until his death five years later.\n\nMarriott Fawckner Nicholls was born in London on 12 May 1898, the son of Marriott Edwin Nicholls. He received his basic education at the City of London School after which he attended Clare College, University of Cambridge. His studies were interrupted due to the First World War during which he served in the Royal Fusiliers. He was demobilised in 1919 with the rank of captain. He finally graduated in 1921.\n\nIn 1925 he married the pathologist Norah Schuster (1892-1991). In 1939 he married Mary Edith Harrison (died 1972).\n\nAlso known as \"Nick\", he was fond of fishing and cricket and supported his medical school cricket club.\n\nNicholls undertook his clinical training at St George's Hospital, qualifying in 1923. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (FRCS) in 1926, and graduated with a bachelor of surgery degree in 1928. He received a masters degree in surgery in 1932. He won the Allingham Scholarship in surgery at St George's in 1925 and the Sir Francis Laking Research Scholarship in 1928–29 and in 1929–30. Some of his happiest times were when he became assistant curator of the museum there in 1926.\n\nHe joined the consultant staff at St George's in 1932 and began a successful career in surgery with a specialism in genito-urinary work. He was visiting surgeon at the Atkinson Morley's Convalescent Hospital in 1936, replacing Bryan Burns. He was dean of the Medical School from 1936 to 1956, whilst still actively at work as a surgeon. One of his major difficulties stemmed from the move of St George's Hospital from Hyde Park Corner to Tooting, and he was successful in being the first to effectively transfer his department to this new site. He was a consultant to the Belgrave Children's Hospital and the Royal Chest Hospital and held the position of general surgeon at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital. In addition, he was chairman of the Court of Examiners at the Royal College of Surgeons for 2 years. He also stood for the 1952 Royal College of Surgeons Council elections, however, Price Thomas received most votes. Despite this, he served on the council of the British Association of Urological Surgeons and was president of the Section of Urology of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1960–61.\n\nHe served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during the Second World War (1940-1946), starting as a lieutenant-colonel running a surgical division in Freetown, Sierra Leone, before becoming a brigadier with the Fourteenth Army, serving with South East Asia Command. He was made Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1946.\n\nIn 1962, Nicholls became professor of surgery at the University of Khartoum, Sudan, in succession to Julian Taylor. He was knighted in 1969.\n\nNicholls died of coronary thrombosis in Khartoum, Sudan, on 25 August 1969. He received an obituary in \"The Lancet\" and is recorded in Plarr's Lives of the Fellows. The \"Nicholls Ward\", at St George's Hospital, London, is named in his honour.\n"}

{"id": "46193474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46193474", "title": "Peter Bergmann case", "text": "Peter Bergmann case\n\nThe Peter Bergmann case is an unsolved mystery pertaining to the death of an unidentified man in County Sligo, Ireland. From 12 to 16 June 2009, a man using the alias \"Peter Bergmann\" visited the coastal seaport town of Sligo, in northwest Ireland. He used this alias to check into the Sligo City Hotel, where he stayed during the majority of his visit, and was described by the hotel staff and tenants as having a heavy German accent. The man's movements were captured on CCTV throughout the town; however, the details of his actions and intentions remain unknown. His interactions with other people were limited, and little is known of his origins or the reason for his visit to Sligo.\n\nOn the morning of 16 June, the naked body of the unidentified man was discovered at Rosses Point beach, a popular recreation destination and fishing area near Sligo. Despite having conducted a five-month investigation into the death of \"Peter Bergmann\", the police have never been able to identify the man or develop any leads in the case. \n\nThe mystery is often compared to the Tamam Shud case, of Australia, in which an unidentified man was found dead on a beach shortly after World War II, though the Peter Bergmann case has not achieved nearly the same amount of notoriety or international coverage. This case remains obscure to the public, and the official investigation has not extended to outside of Ireland. \n\nThe case received renewed attention in the 2010s. It was the subject of a 2013 documentary, \"The Last Days of Peter Bergmann\", which was shown at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival and has developed a small following on social media websites such as Reddit, where readers have constructed theories of the case.\n\nBergmann had a slender build, short grey hair, and appeared to be in his late 50s or early 60s. He stood five feet and ten and a half inches tall with blue eyes and a tan complexion. From witness reports, the man was of Germanic descent and spoke with a thick German accent. He was neatly groomed; his face was shaven and his hair was clean and combed.\n\nThe man was well dressed wearing a black leather jacket, blue trousers (size 50), blue socks, a black leather belt and a pair of black shoes (size 44). His clothes were from C&A, a popular fashion retail store in Europe with most of its stores in Germany and Austria. From the man's appearance it was assumed he was a professional worker. He was a frequent smoker and several surveillance videos show him smoking outside often.\n\nOn Friday, 12 June, the unknown man was first spotted at the Ulster Bus Depot in Derry between the time of 14:30 and 16:00. He boarded a bus headed to Sligo Station, carrying a black shoulder bag and a standard carry-on luggage bag. He arrived at 18:28 at the Sligo Bus Station and took a taxi to the Sligo City Hotel where he paid €65 per night in cash. While checking in, he gave the false name of \"Peter Bergmann\" and listed his address as Ainstettersn 15, 4472, Vienna, Austria. \n\nDuring his stay at the hotel, the man was seen on security camera footage leaving the building with a purple plastic bag full of items or personal effects. However, when he returned from his long walk he was no longer carrying the bag. It is presumed that he was disposing of his belongings throughout the town of Sligo and then folding the bag and putting it in his pocket. Authorities were unable to identify what he was throwing away in the public rubbish bins as the man used the blind spots of the surveillance cameras to his advantage. His movements were very meticulous and methodical as if he knew where to hide his personal belongings that could have identified him.\n\nOn Saturday, 13 June, the man is seen walking to the General Post Office at 10:49 and purchases eight 82-cent stamps and airmail stickers. \n\nOn Sunday, 14 June, between 11:00 and 11:30 the man left the Sligo City Hotel and asked a taxi driver recommendations for a nice quiet beach where he could swim. The taxi driver stated that Rosses Point would be the best place and proceeded to drive the unknown man to the beach. The man returned with the same taxi and was dropped off at the bus station in Sligo. \n\nThe next day (Monday, 15 June), the man checked out of the hotel at 13:06 and handed in his room key. He left with a black shoulder bag, a purple plastic bag, and a different black luggage bag. He did not have the same black carry-on luggage bag he had when he first arrived in Sligo. He walked to the bus station via Quay Street, Wine Street and stopped at Quayside Shopping Centre and awkwardly waited in the doorway for a number of minutes. At 13:16 he left the Quayside Shopping Centre and walked along Wine Street in the direction of the bus station, still carrying all three bags. At 13:38 he ordered a cappuccino and a ham and cheese toasted sandwich at the bus station. While eating his food, he looked at pieces of paper that he kept in his pocket. After reading the pieces of paper, he tore the paper in half and threw it away in a nearby rubbish bin. He then mounted a bus that departed at 14:20 for Rosses Point. It was reported that he was seen by 16 people while walking on the beach, casually greeting the passersby. \n\nThe following morning, Tuesday 16 June, Arthur Kinsella and his son Brian, who was training for a triathlon, found his naked body lying on the beach at 6:45 in the morning. Arthur and Brian said the Lord's Prayer for the man, and then called the Gardaí. At 8:10, Dr Valerie McGowan officially pronounced the man dead. Following the discovery of the man's dead body, a five-month investigation was conducted by Gardaí.\n\nUpon the police investigation following his death, the address he gave belonged to a vacant lot. This implies that the man wanted to remain unknown and he pre-emptively planned his moves so that he could not be identified.\n\nAccording to the post mortem report, the body of the man was found naked on Rosses Point beach with his clothes scattered along the shore, with no wallet, money or form of identification. The Sligo medical examiner deemed the cause of death to be drowning and found no signs of foul play that would give reason to believe the man's death was a homicide. The man's teeth were in good condition and showed signs of frequent dental work in his life. He had bridging, root canals, crowns and had a full gold tooth on the upper back right side of his mouth and a small silver filling along the gum of a tooth on the left side of the lower jaw. \n\nDespite his well-groomed and dressed exterior, the man was in very poor health. The post mortem showed that he had advanced stages of prostate cancer and bone tumours. His heart showed signs of previous heart attacks and he possessed only one kidney, the other being removed. For a man who had serious health conditions, the toxicology report stated that he had no medication of any sort in his system. The medical examiner stated that, due to his heart attacks and health status, the man would have been in significant pain and required prescription pain medicine or at least over-the-counter pain relievers to manage his pain.\n\nAfter a five-month investigation the body was buried in Sligo. The funeral was attended by four Gardaí.\n\nIn 2015, the French newspaper \"Le Monde\" reported that they had contacted the Austrian police about the case and that the Austrian police commented that the Irish police had never contacted them. \"Le Monde\" also reported that there is no Interpol notice for the unidentified man, stating that as the body is recovered he does not fall into the two Interpol categories of 'missing person' or a 'wanted person'. It is up to his country of origin to report him as missing.\n\n\n"}

In contrast to physiologically accurate but computationally expensive neuron models like the Hodgkin–Huxley model, the QIF model seeks only to produce action potential-like patterns and ignores subtleties like gating variables, which play an important role in generating action potentials in a real neuron. However, the QIF model is incredibly easy to implement and compute, and relatively straightforward to study and understand, thus has found ubiquitous use in computational neuroscience .\n\nA quadratic integrate and fire neuron is defined by the autonomous differential equation,\n\nwhere formula_2 is a real positive constant. Note that a solution to this differential equation is the tangent function, which blows up in finite time. Thus a \"spike\" is said to have occurred when the solution reaches positive infinity, and the solution is reset to negative infinity.\n\nWhen implementing this model in computers, a threshold crossing value (formula_3) and a reset value (formula_4) is assigned, so that when the solution rises above the threshold, formula_5, the solution is immediately reset to formula_4\n"}
{"id": "411782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411782", "title": "Staining", "text": "Staining\n\nStaining is an auxiliary technique used in microscopy to enhance contrast in the microscopic image. Stains and dyes are frequently used in biology and medicine to highlight structures in biological tissues for viewing, often with the aid of different microscopes. Stains may be used to define and examine bulk tissues (highlighting, for example, muscle fibers or connective tissue), cell populations (classifying different blood cells, for instance), or organelles within individual cells.\n\nIn biochemistry it involves adding a class-specific (DNA, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates) dye to a substrate to qualify or quantify the presence of a specific compound. Staining and fluorescent tagging can serve similar purposes. Biological staining is also used to mark cells in flow cytometry, and to flag proteins or nucleic acids in gel electrophoresis.\n\nSimple staining is staining with only one stain/dye. There are various kinds of multiple staining, many of which are examples of counterstaining, differential staining, or both, including double staining and triple staining.\n\nStaining is not limited to biological materials, it can also be used to study the morphology of other materials for example the lamellar structures of semi-crystalline polymers or the domain structures of block copolymers.\n\n\"In vivo\" staining (also called vital staining or intravital staining) is the process of dyeing living tissues—\"in vivo\" means \"in life\" (compare with \"in vitro\" staining). By causing certain cells or structures to take on contrasting colour(s), their form (morphology) or position within a cell or tissue can be readily seen and studied. The usual purpose is to reveal cytological details that might otherwise not be apparent; however, staining can also reveal where certain chemicals or specific chemical reactions are taking place within cells or tissues.\n\n\"In vitro\" staining involves colouring cells or structures that have been removed from their biological context. Certain stains are often combined to reveal more details and features than a single stain alone. Combined with specific protocols for fixation and sample preparation, scientists and physicians can use these standard techniques as consistent, repeatable diagnostic tools. A counterstain is stain that makes cells or structures more visible, when not completely visible with the principal stain.\n\nWhile ex vivo, many cells continue to live and metabolize until they are \"fixed\". Some staining methods are based on this property. Those stains excluded by the living cells but taken up by the already dead cells are called vital stains (e.g. trypan blue or propidium iodide for eukaryotic cells). Those that enter and stain living cells are called supravital stains (e.g. New Methylene Blue and brilliant cresyl blue for reticulocyte staining). However, these stains are eventually toxic to the organism, some more so than others. Partly due to their toxic interaction inside a living cell, when supravital stains enter a living cell, they might produce a characteristic pattern of staining different from the staining of an already fixed cell (e.g. \"reticulocyte\" look versus diffuse \"polychromasia\"). To achieve desired effects, the stains are used in very dilute solutions ranging from to (Howey, 2000). Note that many stains may be used in both living and fixed cells.\n\nThe preparatory steps involved depend on the type of analysis planned; some or all of the following procedures may be required.\n\nFixation–which may itself consist of several steps–aims to preserve the shape of the cells or tissue involved as much as possible. Sometimes heat fixation is used to kill, adhere, and alter the specimen so it accepts stains. Most chemical fixatives (chemicals causing fixation) generate chemical bonds between proteins and other substances within the sample, increasing their rigidity. Common fixatives include formaldehyde, ethanol, methanol, and/or picric acid. Pieces of tissue may be embedded in paraffin wax to increase their mechanical strength and stability and to make them easier to cut into thin slices.\n\nPermeabilization involves treatment of cells with (usually) a mild surfactant. This treatment dissolves cell membranes, and allows larger dye molecules into the cell's interior.\n\nMounting usually involves attaching the samples to a glass microscope slide for observation and analysis. In some cases, cells may be grown directly on a slide. For samples of loose cells (as with a blood smear or a pap smear) the sample can be directly applied to a slide. For larger pieces of tissue, thin sections (slices) are made using a microtome; these slices can then be mounted and inspected.\n\nMost of the dyes commonly used in microscopy are available as BSC-certified stains. This means that samples of the manufacturer's batch have been tested by an independent body, the Biological Stain Commission (BSC), and found to meet or exceed certain standards of purity, dye content and performance in staining techniques. These standards are published in the Commission's journal Biotechnic & Histochemistry. Many dyes are inconsistent in composition from one supplier to another. The use of BSC-certified stains eliminates a source of unexpected results.\n\nSome vendors sell stains \"certified\" by themselves rather than by the Biological Stain Commission. Such products may or may not be suitable for diagnostic and other applications.\n\nA simple staining method for bacteria that is usually successful, even when the \"positive staining\" methods detailed below fail, is to use a negative stain. This can be achieved by smearing the sample onto the slide and then applying nigrosin (a black synthetic dye) or India ink (an aqueous suspension of carbon particles). After drying, the microorganisms may be viewed in bright field microscopy as lighter inclusions well-contrasted against the dark environment surrounding them. Note: negative staining is a mild technique that may not destroy the microorganisms, and is therefore unsuitable for studying pathogens.\n\nGram staining is used to determine gram status to classify bacteria broadly. It is based on the composition of their cell wall. Gram staining uses crystal violet to stain cell walls, iodine as a mordant, and a fuchsin or safranin counterstain to mark all bacteria. Gram status is important in medicine; the presence or absence of a cell wall changes the bacterium's susceptibility to some antibiotics.\n\nGram-positive bacteria stain dark blue or violet. Their cell wall is typically rich with peptidoglycan and lacks the secondary membrane and lipopolysaccharide layer found in Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nOn most Gram-stained preparations, Gram-negative organisms appear red or pink because they are counterstained. Because of presence of higher lipid content, after alcohol-treatment, the porosity of the cell wall increases, hence the CVI complex (crystal violet – iodine) can pass through. Thus, the primary stain is not retained. Also, in contrast to most Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria have only a few layers of peptidoglycan and a secondary cell membrane made primarily of lipopolysaccharide.\n\nEndospore staining is used to identify the presence or absence of endospores, which make bacteria very difficult to kill. This is particularly useful for identifying endospore-forming bacterial pathogens such as \"Clostridium difficile\".\n\nZiehl-Neelsen staining is used to stain species of \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\" that do not stain with the standard laboratory staining procedures such as Gram staining.\n\nThe stains used are the red coloured Carbol fuchsin that stains the bacteria and a counter stain such as Methylene blue\n\nHaematoxylin and eosin staining protocol is used frequently in histology to examine thin sections of tissue. Haematoxylin stains cell nuclei blue, while eosin stains cytoplasm, connective tissue and other extracellular substances pink or red. Eosin is strongly absorbed by red blood cells, colouring them bright red. In a skilfully made H & E preparation the red blood cells are almost orange, and collagen and cytoplasm (especially muscle) acquire different shades of pink. When the staining is done by a machine, the subtle differences in eosinophilia are often lost. Hematoxylin stains the cell nucleus and other acidic structures (such as RNA-rich portions of the cytoplasm and the matrix of hyaline cartilage) blue. In contrast, eosin stains the cytoplasm and collagen pink.\n\nPapanicolaou staining, or Pap staining, is a frequently used method for examining cell samples from various bodily secretions. It is frequently used to stain Pap smear specimens. It uses a combination of haematoxylin, Orange G, eosin Y, Light Green SF yellowish, and sometimes Bismarck Brown Y.\n\nPeriodic acid-Schiff staining is used to mark carbohydrates (glycogen, glycoprotein, proteoglycans). It is used to distinguish different types of glycogen storage diseases.\n\nMasson's trichrome is (as the name implies) a three-colour staining protocol. The recipe has evolved from Masson's original technique for different specific applications, but all are well-suited to distinguish cells from surrounding connective tissue. Most recipes produce red keratin and muscle fibers, blue or green staining of collagen and bone, light red or pink staining of cytoplasm, and black cell nuclei.\n\nThe Romanowsky stains are all based on a combination of eosinate (chemically reduced eosin) and methylene blue (sometimes with its oxidation products azure A and azure B). Common variants include Wright's stain, Jenner's stain, May-Grunwald stain, Leishman stain and Giemsa stain.\n\nAll are used to examine blood or bone marrow samples. They are preferred over H&E for inspection of blood cells because different types of leukocytes (white blood cells) can be readily distinguished. All are also suited to examination of blood to detect blood-borne parasites such as malaria.\n\nSilver staining is the use of silver to stain histologic sections. This kind of staining is important especially to show proteins (for example type III collagen) and DNA. It is used to show both substances inside and outside cells. Silver staining is also used in temperature gradient gel electrophoresis.\n\nSome cells are \"argentaffin\". These reduce silver solution to metallic silver after formalin fixation. This method was discovered by Italian Camillo Golgi, by using a reaction between silver nitrate and potassium dichromate, thus precipitating silver chromate in some cells (see Golgi's method). Other cells are \"argyrophilic\". These reduce silver solution to metallic silver after being exposed to the stain that contains a reductant, for example hydroquinone or formalin.\n\nSudan staining is the use of Sudan dyes to stain sudanophilic substances, usually lipids. Sudan III, Sudan IV, Oil Red O, Osmium tetroxide, and Sudan Black B are often used. Sudan staining is often used to determine the level of fecal fat to diagnose steatorrhea.\n\nSpecial technique designed for staining true endospores with the use of malachite green dye, once stained, they do not decolourize.\n\nDifferent stains react or concentrate in different parts of a cell or tissue, and these properties are used to advantage to reveal specific parts or areas. Some of the most common biological stains are listed below. Unless otherwise marked, all of these dyes may be used with fixed cells and tissues; vital dyes (suitable for use with living organisms) are noted.\n\nAcridine orange (AO) is a nucleic acid selective fluorescent cationic dye useful for cell cycle determination. It is cell-permeable, and interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions. When bound to DNA, it is very similar spectrally to fluorescein. Like fluorescein, it is also useful as a non-specific stain for backlighting conventionally stained cells on the surface of a solid sample of tissue (fluorescence backlighted staining).\n\nBismarck brown (also Bismarck brown Y or Manchester brown) imparts a yellow colour to acid mucins.\n\nCarmine is an intensely red dye used to stain glycogen, while Carmine alum is a nuclear stain. Carmine stains require the use of a mordant, usually aluminum.\n\nCoomassie blue (also brilliant blue) nonspecifically stains proteins a strong blue colour. It is often used in gel electrophoresis.\n\nCresyl violet stains the acidic components of the neuronal cytoplasm a violet colour, specifically nissl bodies. Often used in brain research.\n\nCrystal violet, when combined with a suitable mordant, stains cell walls purple. Crystal violet is the stain used in Gram staining.\n\nDAPI is a fluorescent nuclear stain, excited by ultraviolet light and showing strong blue fluorescence when bound to DNA. DAPI binds with A=T rich repeats of chromosomes. DAPI is also not visible with regular transmission microscopy. It may be used in living or fixed cells. DAPI-stained cells are especially appropriate for cell counting.\n\nEosin is most often used as a counterstain to haematoxylin, imparting a pink or red colour to cytoplasmic material, cell membranes, and some extracellular structures. It also imparts a strong red colour to red blood cells. Eosin may also be used as a counterstain in some variants of Gram staining, and in many other protocols. There are actually two very closely related compounds commonly referred to as eosin. Most often used is eosin Y (also known as eosin Y ws or eosin yellowish); it has a very slightly yellowish cast. The other eosin compound is eosin B (eosin bluish or imperial red); it has a very faint bluish cast. The two dyes are interchangeable, and the use of one or the other is more a matter of preference and tradition.\n\nEthidium bromide intercalates and stains DNA, providing a fluorescent red-orange stain. Although it will not stain healthy cells, it can be used to identify cells that are in the final stages of apoptosis – such cells have much more permeable membranes. Consequently, ethidium bromide is often used as a marker for apoptosis in cells populations and to locate bands of DNA in gel electrophoresis. The stain may also be used in conjunction with acridine orange (AO) in viable cell counting. This EB/AO combined stain causes live cells to fluoresce green whilst apoptotic cells retain the distinctive red-orange fluorescence.\n\nAcid fuchsine may be used to stain collagen, smooth muscle, or mitochondria.\nAcid fuchsine is used as the nuclear and cytoplasmic stain in Mallory's trichrome method. Acid fuchsine stains cytoplasm in some variants of Masson's trichrome. In Van Gieson's picro-fuchsine, acid fuchsine imparts its red colour to collagen fibres. Acid fuchsine is also a traditional stain for mitochondria (Altmann's method).\n\nHaematoxylin (hematoxylin in North America) is a nuclear stain. Used with a mordant, haematoxylin stains nuclei blue-violet or brown. It is most often used with eosin in H&E (haematoxylin and eosin) staining—one of the most common procedures in histology.\n\nHoechst is a \"bis\"-benzimidazole derivative compound that binds to the \"minor groove\" of DNA. Often used in fluorescence microscopy for DNA staining, Hoechst stains appear yellow when dissolved in aqueous solutions and emit blue light under UV excitation. There are two major types of Hoechst: \"Hoechst 33258\" and \"Hoechst 33342\". The two compounds are functionally similar, but with a little difference in structure. Hoechst 33258 contains a terminal hydroxyl group and is thus more soluble in aqueous solution, however this characteristics reduces its ability to penetrate the plasma membrane. Hoechst 33342 contains an ethyl substitution on the terminal hydroxyl group (i.e. an ethylether group) making it more hydrophobic for easier plasma membrane passage\n\nIodine is used in chemistry as an indicator for starch. When starch is mixed with iodine in solution, an intensely dark blue colour develops, representing a starch/iodine complex. Starch is a substance common to most plant cells and so a weak iodine solution will stain starch present in the cells. Iodine is one component in the staining technique known as Gram staining, used in microbiology.\nLugol's solution or Lugol's iodine (IKI) is a brown solution that turns black in the presence of starches and can be used as a cell stain, making the cell nuclei more visible. Iodine is also used as a mordant in Gram's staining, it enhances dye to enter through the pore present in the cell wall/membrane.\n\nMalachite green (also known as diamond green B or victoria green B) can be used as a blue-green counterstain to safranin in the Gimenez staining technique for bacteria. It can also be used to directly stain spores.\n\nMethyl green is used commonly with bright-field, as well as fluorescence microscopes to dye the chromatin of cells so that they are more easily viewed.\n\nMethylene blue is used to stain animal cells, such as human cheek cells, to make their nuclei more observable. Also used to stain the blood film and used in cytology.\n\nNeutral red (or toluylene red) stains Nissl substance red. It is usually used as a counterstain in combination with other dyes.\n\nNile blue (or Nile blue A) stains nuclei blue. It may be used with living cells.\n\nNile red (also known as Nile blue oxazone) is formed by boiling Nile blue with sulfuric acid. This produces a mix of Nile red and Nile blue. Nile red is a lipophilic stain; it will accumulate in lipid globules inside cells, staining them red. Nile red can be used with living cells. It fluoresces strongly when partitioned into lipids, but practically not at all in aqueous solution.\n\nOsmium tetraoxide is used in optical microscopy to stain lipids. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.\n\nPropidium iodide is a fluorescent intercalating agent that can be used to stain cells. Propidium iodide is used as a DNA stain in flow cytometry to evaluate cell viability or DNA content in cell cycle analysis, or in microscopy to visualise the nucleus and other DNA-containing organelles. Propidium Iodide cannot cross the membrane of live cells, making it useful to differentiate necrotic, apoptotic and healthy cells. PI also binds to RNA, necessitating treatment with nucleases to distinguish between RNA and DNA staining\n\nRhodamine is a protein specific fluorescent stain commonly used in fluorescence microscopy.\n\nSafranine (or Safranine O) is a red cationic dye. It binds to nuclei (DNA) and other tissue polyanions, including glycosaminoglycans in cartilage and mast cells, and components of lignin and plastids in plant tissues. Safranine should not be confused with saffron, an expensive natural dye that is used in some methods to impart a yellow colour to collagen, to contrast with blue and red colours imparted by other dyes to nuclei and cytoplasm in animal (including human) tissues.\n\nThe incorrect spelling \"safranin\" is in common use. The -ine ending is appropriate \nfor safranine O because this dye is an amine,\n\nTissues which take up stains are called chromatic. Chromosomes were so named because of their ability to absorb a violet stain.\n\nPositive affinity for a specific stain may be designated by the suffix \"-philic\". For example, tissues that stain with an azure stain may be referred to as azurophilic. This may also be used for more generalized staining properties, such as acidophilic for tissues that stain by acidic stains (most notably eosin), basophilic when staining in basic dyes, and \"amphophilic\" when staining with either acid or basic dyes. In contrast, chromophobic tissues do not take up coloured dye readily.\n\nAs in light microscopy, stains can be used to enhance contrast in transmission electron microscopy. Electron-dense compounds of heavy metals are typically used.\n\nPhosphotungstic acid is a common negative stain for viruses, nerves, polysaccharides, and other biological tissue materials.\n\nOsmium tetroxide is used in optical microscopy to stain lipids. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance. Because it is a heavy metal that absorbs electrons, it is perhaps the most common stain used for morphology in biological electron microscopy. It is also used for the staining of various polymers for the study of their morphology by TEM. is very volatile and extremely toxic. It is a strong oxidizing agent as the osmium has an oxidation number of +8. It aggressively oxidizes many materials, leaving behind a deposit of non-volatile osmium in a lower oxidation state.\n\nRuthenium tetroxide is equally volatile and even more aggressive than osmium tetraoxide and able to stain even materials that resist the osmium stain, e.g. polyethylene.\n\nOther chemicals used in electron microscopy staining include:\nammonium molybdate, cadmium iodide, carbohydrazide, ferric chloride, hexamine, indium trichloride, lanthanum nitrate, lead acetate, lead citrate, lead(II) nitrate, periodic acid, phosphomolybdic acid, potassium ferricyanide, potassium ferrocyanide, ruthenium red, silver nitrate, silver proteinate, sodium chloroaurate, thallium nitrate, thiosemicarbazide, uranyl acetate, uranyl nitrate, and vanadyl sulfate.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7464962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7464962", "title": "The Terrible Dogfish", "text": "The Terrible Dogfish\n\nThe Terrible Dogfish () is a dogfish-like sea-monster, which appears in Carlo Collodi's 1883 book \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" (\"Le avventure di Pinocchio\"). It is described as being larger than a five story building, a kilometre long (not including the tail) and sporting three rows of teeth in a mouth that can easily accommodate a train. So fearsome is its reputation, that in chapter XXXIV, it is revealed that the Dogfish is nicknamed \"The Attila of fish and fishermen\" (\"L'Attila dei pesci e dei pescatori\").\n\nThe Dogfish is first mentioned in chapter XXIV, when Pinocchio, searching for his creator Mister Geppetto, is informed by a dolphin that he has likely been swallowed by the creature which \"...for some days has come to wreak extermination and desolation in our waters\". The Dogfish is later mentioned in chapter XXVI by Pinocchio's school friends on the Island of the Busy Bees (\"Isola delle Api Industriose\"), who tell him that the creature has been sighted on the coast, to coax Pinocchio away from school.\n\nThe Dogfish makes its first appearance in chapter XXXIV when Pinocchio, recently transformed from a donkey to his puppet form, has entered the sea to escape from his former handler. The Fairy with Turquoise Hair, in the form of a mountain goat, warns Pinocchio of the Dogfish too late, and the puppet is swallowed whole, along with a tuna whom Pinocchio befriends. Pinocchio discovers his father, who reveals that he has been trapped within the Dogfish for two years, surviving on ship supplies swallowed by the creature. When the Dogfish is revealed to suffer from asthma, a condition that forces it to sleep with its head raised from the water, Pinocchio carries Geppetto on his back and swims out of the Dogfish's mouth. When Pinocchio's strength begins to fail, the tuna helps them reach the shore.\n\nIn the Walt Disney film \"Pinocchio\", the sea-monster (named Monstro, the term for monster in Portuguese and in archaic Italian) is portrayed as a terrible giant whale (a combination of a sperm whale and blue whale), and first mentioned in a message from the Blue Fairy that Geppetto, sailing to find Pinocchio, has been swallowed by the creature. The two search for the monster, but are frustrated by the fear the various nekton display at the mention of his name. After finally discovering Monstro, who swallows Pinocchio, he discovers Geppetto in Monstro's throat. There, Pinocchio frees them by starting a fire and thus prompting Monstro to expel them from his mouth, whereupon Monstro becomes enraged and pursues them, but fails to recapture them and, when Pinocchio pulls Geppetto into a cove, Monstro crashes against the rocks surrounding it, possibly killing him.\n\nMonstro was animated by Wolfgang Reitherman, the go-to man for action sequences among Disney's Nine Old Men.\n\nThe Disney version of Monstro also appears in the video game \"Kingdom Hearts\" as a supporting world, where Pinocchio and Geppetto temporarily live until being rescued. Within Monstro dwell many Heartless, including one called the Parasite Cage, which traps Pinocchio in its cage-like stomach, and delivers the puppet to Riku, who wishes to use Pinocchio's heart to rescue Kairi. After Kingdom Hearts is sealed, Monstro presumably returns to his world. He later reappears in \"\", as a figment of Sora and Riku's memories. Monstro himself is not physically seen, but card rooms resembling his bowels are explored. In the \"Final Mix\" version of \"\", Monstro appears as a boss fight in the Mirage Arena. He reappears as a sub-world in his homeworld, Prankster's Paradise, in \"\".\n\nIn addition, Monstro had a guest star appearance in a \"Bonkers\" comic story titled \"Whale of a Tale\", published in the December 1994 issue of \"Disney Adventures\". In this story, he is a polite actor playing a role in \"Pinocchio\", who has not found work in the movies since then; he is duped by a gang of crooks, posing as a movie company, into breaking into banks for them to rob, and upon finding out the truth, helps Bonkers catch the criminals.\n\nThe Whale also plays a notable role in the Disneyland version of Fantasmic!, and also has a smaller role in the Dancing Bubbles scene in the Disney's Hollywood Studios version.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11092324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11092324", "title": "The central science", "text": "The central science\n\nChemistry is often called the central science because of its role in connecting the physical sciences, which include chemistry, with the life sciences and applied sciences such as medicine and engineering. The nature of this relationship is one of the main topics in the philosophy of chemistry and in scientometrics. The phrase was popularized by its use in a textbook by Theodore L. Brown and H. Eugene LeMay, titled \"Chemistry: The Central Science\", which was first published in 1977, with a thirteenth edition published in 2014.\n\nThe central role of chemistry can be seen in the systematic and hierarchical classification of the sciences by Auguste Comte in which each discipline provides a more general framework for the area it precedes (mathematics → astronomy → physics → chemistry → physiology and medicine → social sciences). Balaban and Klein have more recently proposed a diagram showing partial ordering of sciences in which chemistry may be argued is “the central science” since it provides a significant degree of branching. In forming these connections the lower field cannot be fully reduced to the higher ones. It is recognized that the lower fields possess emergent ideas and concepts that do not exist in the higher fields of science.\n\nThus chemistry is built on an understanding of laws of physics that govern particles such as atoms, protons, neutrons, electrons, thermodynamics, etc. although it has been shown that it has not been “fully 'reduced' to quantum mechanics”. Concepts such as the periodicity of the elements and chemical bonds in chemistry are emergent in that they are more than the underlying forces that are defined by physics.\n\nIn the same way, biology cannot be fully reduced to chemistry despite the fact that the machinery that is responsible for life is composed of molecules. For instance, the machinery of evolution may be described in terms of chemistry by the understanding that it is a mutation in the order of genetic base pairs in the DNA of an organism. However, chemistry cannot fully describe the process since it does not contain concepts such as natural selection that are responsible for driving evolution. Chemistry is fundamental to biology since it provides a methodology for studying and understanding the molecules that compose cells.\n\nConnections made by chemistry are formed through various sub-disciplines that utilize concepts from multiple scientific disciplines. Chemistry and physics are both needed in the areas of physical chemistry, nuclear chemistry, and theoretical chemistry. Chemistry and biology intersect in the areas of biochemistry, medicinal chemistry, molecular biology, chemical biology, molecular genetics, and immunochemistry. Chemistry and the earth sciences intersect in areas like geochemistry and hydrology.\n\n"}

One of the most famous submarines of World War II, she received the Presidential Unit Citation. Her skipper throughout her service, the resolute and resourceful Commander Samuel D. Dealey (1906–1944), \"a submariner's submariner\", was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, as well as four Navy Crosses during his lifetime.\n\nHer keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut, on 1 December 1941. She was launched on 19 August 1942 (sponsored by Miss Helen M. Shaforth, daughter of Rear Admiral John M. Shaforth), and commissioned on 2 December 1942 with Commander Dealey, (Class of 1930) in command.\n\nFollowing shakedown off the East Coast, \"Harder\" sailed for Pearl Harbor, and after a short stay there, she departed on her first war patrol 7 June 1943. Cruising off the coast of Japan, the submarine worked her way inside a picket line and sighted her first target 22 June. She made a radar approach on the surface and fired four torpedoes at the two-ship convoy, hitting the seaplane transport \"Sagara Maru\" (7189 BRT) (which was beached to prevent sinking, but later destroyed). She returned to Midway 7 July.\n\n\"Harder\" began her second war patrol 24 August 1943 from Pearl Harbor, and after touching at Midway Island, she again headed for the Japanese coast. While patrolling off Honshū on 9 September, she attacked and sank \"Koyo Maru\" and later that night ran by an escort ship at a range of without being detected. Two days later the submarine encountered a convoy. After running ahead to improve her firing position, she sank cargo ship \"Yoko Maru\" with a spread of three torpedoes. Continuing her patrol, \"Harder\" sighted two more ships 13 September, but she was forced down by enemy planes while firing torpedoes. Escorts kept the submarine down with a severe depth charge attack which lasted for over two days and almost exhausted her batteries. After evading the Japanese ships, \"Harder\" detected her next target 19 September; a torpedo sent \"Kachisan Maru\" to the bottom almost immediately. Though running in bad weather, \"Harder\" continued to find good targets. On 23 September she sank the 4,500 ton freighter \"Kowa Maru\" and the 5,800 ton tanker \"Daishin Maru\", off Nagoya Bay. Her torpedoes expended, \"Harder\" turned eastward 28 September. After shooting up two armed trawlers 29 September, she touched Midway 4 October and arrived Pearl Harbor four days later.\n\nFor her third war patrol \"Harder\" teamed with and to form a deadly and coordinated attack group (a \"wolfpack\"). Departing 30 October 1943 for the Mariana Islands, \"Harder\" encountered a target 12 November. Promptly dispatching this one, she surfaced and sighted a trawler-escort damaged by the explosion of one of her own depth charges. Submerging again until sunset, the submarine sank the damaged ship with gunfire, then turned toward Saipan in search of new targets. Sighting three \"marus\" on 19 November, she radioed her companions and closed for attack. After passing close by an escorting destroyer, \"Harder\" fired six torpedoes at two ships, sinking \"Udo Maru\". As depth charges began to fall, she pressed the attack; two more torpedoes finished \"Hokko Maru\". \"Harder\" climbed to periscope depth after nightfall to finish off the third \"maru\". Shortly before midnight, she fired several more shots at 6,000-ton \"Nikkō Maru\", but the Japanese ship stubbornly refused to sink. A brave, but doomed, enemy crew kept the cargo ship afloat until \"Harder\" had expended all torpedoes, many of which ran erratically. Rough weather the next day finally sank the damaged target. \"Harder\" returned to Pearl Harbor on 30 November, then sailed to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul.\n\nReturning to action in the Pacific, \"Harder\" reached Pearl Harbor on 27 February 1944 and departed on her fourth war patrol 16 March in company with .\n\nShe headed for the western Caroline Islands where she was assigned duty as lifeguard ship for downed aviators. During American air strikes against Woleai on 1 April, \"Harder\" received word of an injured pilot awaiting rescue from the beach of a small enemy-held island west of Woleai. Protected by air cover, she nosed against a reef, maintained her position with both propellers, and sent a boat ashore through breaking surf. Despite Japanese snipers, boiling shoals, and the precarious position of the submarine, the daring rescue succeeded, and the intrepid submarine returned to the open sea.\n\nOn 13 April an enemy plane sighted \"Harder\" north of the western Carolines and reported her position to the patrolling Japanese destroyer \"Ikazuchi\". As the enemy ship closed to within \"Harder\" fired a spread of torpedoes that sank the attacker within five minutes. Dealey's terse report became famous—\"Expended four torpedoes and one Jap destroyer.\" Four days later \"Harder\" spotted a merchant ship escorted by destroyers. Firing four torpedoes, she sank the 7,000 ton \"Matsue Maru\" and damaged one of the escorts. Then, adding to the enemy's misery, she returned to Woleai where she surfaced on the morning of 20 April to deliver a shore bombardment under cover of a rain squall. She terminated this highly varied and successful patrol at Fremantle submarine base, Western Australia 3 May.\n\nEven greater successes lay ahead. Having sunk one destroyer, \"Harder\" joined the all-out hunt against Japanese destroyers, once considered the most dangerous of foes. Assigned the area around the Japanese fleet anchorage at Tawi-Tawi, \"Harder\" departed Fremantle on 26 May 1944 with and headed for the Celebes Sea.\n\nOn 6 June \"Harder\" entered the heavily patrolled Sibutu Passage between Tawi-Tawi and North Borneo and encountered a convoy of three tankers and two destroyers. She gave chase on the surface but was illuminated by the moon. As one of the destroyers turned to attack, \"Harder\" submerged, turned her stern to the charging destroyer, and fired three torpedoes at range of . Two struck \"Minazuki\" and exploded; the destroyer sank within five minutes. After attacking the second escort without success, \"Harder\" was held down by a depth charge attack while the convoy escaped.\n\nEarly next morning an enemy plane spotted \"Harder\". The submarine soon sighted another destroyer searching the area for her. As before, \"Harder\" took the initiative as the enemy closed the range. The sub fired three torpedoes at short range, and two of them struck amidships, one detonating the ship's magazine with a tremendous explosion. \"Hayanami\" sank a minute later. Following the inevitable depth charge attack, \"Harder\" transited the Sibutu Passage after dark and steamed to the northeast coast of Borneo. There on the night of 8 June she picked up six Australian Coastwatchers, and early next day she headed once more for Sibutu Passage.\n\nThat evening \"Harder\" sighted two enemy destroyers patrolling the narrowest part of the passage, just a few miles from Tawi-Tawi. After submerging, she made an undetected approach and at fired four torpedoes at the overlapping targets. The second and third torpedoes blasted \"Tanikaze\"; she sank almost immediately, her boilers erupting with a terrific explosion. The fourth shot hit the second ship, which exploded with a blinding flash. Within minutes \"Harder\" surfaced to survey the results, but both ships had disappeared. Soon afterward, she underwent the inevitable depth charge attack by enemy planes, then she set course for a point south of Tawi-Tawi to reconnoiter.\n\nOn the afternoon of 10 June \"Harder\" sighted a large Japanese task force, including three battleships and four cruisers with screening destroyers. An overhead plane spotted the submarine at periscope depth and a screening escort promptly steamed at toward her position. Once again, \"Harder\" became the aggressive adversary. As the range closed to , she fired three torpedoes on a \"down the throat\" shot, then went deep to escape the onrushing destroyer and certain depth charge attack. Within a minute two torpedoes blasted the ship with violent force just as \"Harder\" passed her some below. The deafening explosions shook the submarine far worse than the depth charges and aerial bombs which the infuriated enemy dropped during the next two hours. When she surfaced, \"Harder\" saw only a lighted buoy marking the spot where the unidentified destroyer either sank or was heavily damaged.\n\n\"Harder\" reconnoitered Tawi-Tawi anchorage 11 June and sighted additional enemy cruisers and destroyers. At 16:00 she headed for the open sea and that night transmitted her observations which were of vital importance to Admiral Raymond A. Spruance's fleet prior to the decisive Battle of the Philippine Sea. \"Harder\" steamed to Darwin on 21 June for additional torpedoes, and, after patrolling the Flores Sea south of the Celebes Islands (with Admiral Ralph Christie aboard), she ended the patrol at Darwin on 3 July.\n\nThe important results of \"Harder\"'s fifth war patrol have caused some to call it the most brilliant of the war. Not only did \"Harder\" further deplete the critical supply of destroyers by sinking four of them and heavily damaging or destroying another one in four days, but her frequent attacks and a rash of enemy contact reports on this fleeting marauder so frightened Admiral Soemu Toyoda that he believed Tawi-Tawi surrounded by submarines. As a result, Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa's Mobile Fleet departed Tawi-Tawi a day ahead of schedule. The premature departure upset the Japanese battle plans, and forced Ozawa to delay his carrier force in the Philippine Sea, thus contributing to the stunning defeat suffered by the Japanese in the ensuing battle.\n\n\"Harder's\" radioman, Calvin Bull, was awarded a Bronze Star medal for his role in sinking the five destroyers.\n\n\"Harder\", accompanied by and , departed Fremantle on 5 August 1944 for her sixth and final war patrol. Assigned to the South China Sea off Luzon, the wolf pack headed northward. On 21 August \"Harder\" and \"Haddo\" joined , , and in a coordinated attack against a convoy off Palawan Bay, Mindoro. The Japanese lost four passenger-cargo \"maru\"s, possibly one by \"Harder\".\n\nEarly the next day, \"Harder\" and \"Haddo\" attacked and destroyed three coastal defense vessels off Bataan, \"Harder\" sinking frigates \"Matsuwa\" and \"Hiburi\"; then, joined by \"Hake\" that night, they headed for Caiman Point, Luzon. At dawn 23 August \"Haddo\" attacked and fatally damaged off Cape Bolinao. Enemy trawlers towed the stricken destroyer to Dasol Bay, and \"Haddo\", her torpedoes expended, informed \"Harder\" and \"Hake\" the following night of the attack and left the wolf-pack for replenishment at Biak.\n\"Harder\" and \"Hake\" remained off Dasol Bay, searching for new targets. Before dawn 24 August they identified what they thought was a Japanese minesweeper and the three-stack Siamese destroyer \"Phra Ruang\". It was later found out to be Japanese destroyer Kaibokan CD-22 and PB-102. The latter was built as , a Clemson-class destroyer, but she was damaged while under repair at Surabaya and scuttled early in World War II. The Japanese Navy discovered the wreck, and raised, repaired, and recommissioned it into Japanese service in 1943 as Patrol Boat 102. \n\nAs \"Hake\" closed to attack, the destroyer turned away toward Dasol Bay. \"Hake\" broke off her approach, turned northward, and sighted \"Harder\"'s periscope about dead ahead. Swinging southward, \"Hake\" then sighted CD-22 about off her port quarter swinging toward them. To escape the charging escort, \"Hake\" started deep and rigged for silent running. At 07:28 she heard 15 rapid depth charges explode in the distance astern. She continued evasive action that morning, then returned to the general area of the attack shortly after noon. She swept the area at periscope depth but found only a ring of marker buoys covering a radius of one-half mile.\n\nThe vigorous depth charge attack had sunk the \"Harder\" with all hands. The Japanese report of the attack concluded that \"much oil, wood chips, and cork floated in the vicinity.\" The United States Navy declared her lost January 2, 1945.\n\nDubbed \"Hit 'Em Harder,\" she had wreaked havoc among Japanese shipping. Her record of aggressive daring exploits became almost legendary. All six of her patrols were designated successful.\n\n\"Harder\" received six battle stars and the Presidential Unit Citation for World War II service. In accordance with Navy custom, the citation was presented to the second \"Harder\" upon commissioning.\n\nDespite the losses of 9 more submarines in the fall of 1944, towards the end of the war U.S. fleet boats were actively penetrating through the Inland Sea, and the Japanese shipping losses continued, albeit at a slower rate.\n\n\"Harder's\" skipper left behind a wife and three children.\n\nSUBJECT : U.S.S.

Two chapbooks were also published based on the novel. No publication date appeared on the title page.\nThe first chapbook version was entitled \"Wolfstein; or, The Mysterious Bandit\" and was published and printed by John Bailey at 116, Chancery Lane in London in 1822. The chapbook was a condensed version of the novel in 20 pages. The total length was 28 pages including the second story. Chapbooks were meant for popular consumption, serving the same function as a paperback would. The chapbook sold for sixpence.\n\nAnother more condensed twelve-page chapbook was published in 1850 by Thomas Redriffe in London entitled \"Wolfstein, the Murderer; or, The Secrets of a Robber's Cave: A Terrific Romance. To which is Added, The Two Serpents, an Oriental Apologue.\" The Ossian epigraph appeared on the title page: \"A tale of horror, of murder, and of deeds done in darkness.\" Printed for Thomas Redriffe, Piccadilly. The price was \"Two Pence\". Printed by William Bethell, 10, Marshall-street, Liverpool. No date of publication appeared on the title page. The story was six pages long, pages three through eight. The second story was four pages long, pages nine through twelve.\n\nThe frontispiece consisted of a drawing of Wolfstein confronted by a skeleton struck by lightning. He stands over the corpse of Serena. The drawing is a more condensed version of the 1822 frontispiece. The caption reads: \"Deeper grew the gloom of the cavern, and darkness seemed to press around him. Suddenly a flash of lightning burst through the cavern, followed by thunder that appeared to convulse the universal fabric of nature; and borne on the sulphurous blast, the Prince of Terrors stood before him.\"\n\nThe chapbook follows the plot of the first section of the novel \"St. Irvyne\" on the bandits but omits the second part featuring Frederic Nempere in Geneva. The account is radically condensed.\nThe name of Cavigni, leader of the bandits, is changed to Stiletto. The name of Megalena is changed to Serena. The character of Ginotti, the Rosicrucian alchemist, does not appear.\n\nThe opening scene is of a raging thunderstorm. Wolfstein is a wanderer in the Swiss Alps who seeks cover from the storm. He is a distraught outcast who plans to commit suicide. A group of monks carrying a body for burial in a torch-light procession runs into him and saves his life.\n\nBandits then attack them. Wolfstein is accepted as a member of the bandits. He becomes used to a life of crime. But a rivalry develops between him and Stilleto over Serena. He decides to poison the chief by secretly placing a white powder in his wine. Stiletto drinks the poison and dies.\n\nWolfstein is subsequently elected Captain by the other bandits after the murder of Stiletto. He then is racked by dreams of the murdered Cavigni which fill him with dread and foreboding.\nDays after the murder, Wolfstein seeks to seduce Serena. He observes her in prayer. She refuses his advances and pulls out a dagger. In response, Wolfstein unsheaths his sword and stabs her to death.\n\nThunder was heard in the cell. The Prince of Terror then appeared before him. A “strange and unnatural stench” infused the room as “the yawning gulf of hell” swallowed Wolfstein as blue flames swirled around his body.\n\nThe final paragraph concludes with a moral of the story. Plunging into despair and indulging in crime are not the ways to confront misfortune. The tenets of morality and truth should be diligently followed. Only “misery, disgrace and ruin” result when these principles are ignored.\n\n \n"}
{"id": "13336525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13336525", "title": "Work systems", "text": "Work systems\n\nWork system has been used loosely in many areas. This article concerns its use in understanding IT-reliant systems in organizations. A notable use of the term occurred in 1977 in the first volume of MIS Quarterly in two articles by Bostrom and Heinen (1977). Later Sumner and Ryan (1994) used it to explain problems in the adoption of CASE (computer-aided software engineering). A number of socio-technical systems researchers such as Trist and Mumford also used the term occasionally, but seemed not to define it in detail. In contrast, the work system approach defines work system carefully and uses it as a basic analytical concept.\n\nA work system is a system in which human participants and/or machines perform work (processes and activities) using information, technology, and other resources to produce products/services for internal or external customers. Typical business organizations contain work systems that procure materials from suppliers, produce products, deliver products to customers, find customers, create financial reports, hire employees, coordinate work across depa */ ERROR ERROR ERROR \\* ed to processing information.\nThe relationship between work systems in general and the special cases implies that the same basic concepts apply to all of the special cases, which also have their own specialized vocabulary. In turn, this implies that much of the body of knowledge for the current information systems discipline can be organized around a work system core.\n\nSpecific information systems exist to support (other) work systems. Many different degrees of overlap are possible between an information system and a work system that it supports. For example, an information system might provide information for a non-overlapping work system, as happens when a commercial marketing survey provides information to a firm’s marketing managers In other cases, an information system may be an integral part of a work system, as happens in highly automated manufacturing and in ecommerce web sites. In these situations, participants in the work system are also participants in the information system, the work system cannot operate properly without the information system, and the information system has little significance outside of the work system.\n\nThe work system approach for understanding systems includes both a static view of a current (or proposed) system in operation and a dynamic view of how a system evolves over time through planned change and unplanned adaptations. The static view is summarized by the work system framework, which identifies the basic elements for understanding and evaluating a work system. An easily recognized triangular representation of the work system framework has appeared in Alter (2002, 2003, 2008, 2013) and elsewhere. The work system itself consists of four elements: the processes and activities, participants, information, and technologies. Five other elements must be included in even a rudimentary understanding of a work system’s operation, context, and significance. Those elements are the products/services produced, customers, environment, infrastructure, and strategies. Customers may also be participants in a work system, as happens when a doctor examines a patient. This framework is prescriptive enough to be useful in describing the system being studied, identifying problems and opportunities, describing possible changes, and tracing how those changes might affect other parts of the work system.\n\nThe definitions of the 9 elements of the work system framework are as follows:\n\nProcesses and activities include everything that happens within the work system. The term processes and activities is used instead of the term business process because many work systems do not contain highly structured business processes involving a prescribed sequence of steps, each of which is triggered in a pre-defined manner. Such processes are sometimes described as “artful processes” whose sequence and content “depend on the skills, experience, and judgment of the primary actors.” (Hill et al., 2006) In effect, business process is but one of a number of different perspectives for analyzing the activities within a work system. Other perspectives with their own valuable concepts and terminology include decision-making, communication, coordination, control, and information processing.\n\nParticipants are people who perform the work. Some may use computers and IT extensively, whereas others may use little or no technology. When analyzing a work system the more encompassing role of work system participant is more important than the more limited role of technology user (whether or not particular participants happen to be technology users). In work systems that are viewed as service systems, it is especially important to identify activities in which customers are participants.\n\nInformation includes codified and non-codified information used and created as participants perform their work. Information may or may not be computerized. Data not related to the work system is not directly relevant, making the distinction between data and information secondary when describing or analyzing a work system. Knowledge can be viewed as a special case of information.\n\nTechnologies include tools (such as cell phones, projectors, spreadsheet software, and automobiles) and techniques (such as management by objectives, optimization, and remote tracking) that work system participants use while doing their work. \n\nProducts/services are the combination of physical things, information, and services that the work system produces for its customers' benefit and use. This may include physical products, information products, services, intangibles such as enjoyment and peace of mind, and social products such as arrangements, agreements, and organizations. The term \"products/services” is used because the distinction between products and services in marketing and service science (Chesbrough and Spohrer, 2006) is not important for understanding work systems even though product-like vs. service-like is the basis of a series of design dimensions for characterizing and designing the things that a work system produces (Alter, 2012).\n\nCustomers are people who receive direct benefit from products/services the work system produces. Since work systems exist to produce products/services for their customers, an analysis of a work system should consider who the customers are, what they want, and how they use whatever the work system produces. Customers may include external customers who receive an enterprise's products/services and internal customers who are employed by the enterprise, such as customers of a payroll work system. Customers of a work system often are participants in the work system (e.g., patients in a medical exam, students in an educational setting, and clients in a consulting engagement).\n\nEnvironment includes the organizational, cultural, competitive, technical, and regulatory environment within which the work system operates. These factors affect system performance even though the system does not rely on them directly in order to operate. The organization’s general norms of behavior are part of its culture, whereas more specific behavioral norms and expectations about specific activities within the work system are considered part of its processes and activities.\n\nInfrastructure includes human, informational, and technical resources that the work system relies on even though these resources exist and are managed outside of it and are shared with other work systems. Technical infrastructure includes computer networks, programming languages, and other technologies shared by other work systems and often hidden or invisible to work system participants. From an organizational viewpoint such as that expressed in Star and Bowker (2002) rather than a purely technical viewpoint, infrastructure includes human infrastructure, informational infrastructure, and technical infrastructure, all of which can be essential to a work system’s operation and therefore should be considered in any analysis of a work system.\n\nStrategies include the strategies of the work system and of the department(s) and enterprise(s) within which the work system exists. Strategies at the department and enterprise level may help in explaining why the work system operates as it does and whether it is operating properly.\n\nThe dynamic view of a work system starts with the work system life cycle (WSLC) model, which shows how a work system may evolve through multiple iterations of four phases: operation and maintenance, initiation, development, and implementation. The names of the phases were chosen to describe both computerized and non-computerized systems, and to apply regardless of whether application software is acquired, built from scratch, or not used at all. The terms development and implementation have business-oriented meanings that are consistent with Markus and Mao’s (2004) distinction between system development and system implementation.\n\nThis model encompasses both planned and unplanned change. Planned change occurs through a full iteration encompassing the four phases, i.e., starting with an operation and maintenance phase, flowing through initiation, development, and implementation, and arriving at a new operation and maintenance phase. Unplanned change occurs through fixes, adaptations, and experimentation that can occur within any phase. The phases include the following activities:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an example of the iterative nature of a work system’s life cycle, consider the sales system in a software start-up. The first sales system is the CEO selling directly. At some point the CEO can’t do it alone, several salespeople are hired and trained, and marketing materials are produced that can be used by someone less expert than the CEO. As the firm grows, the sales system becomes regionalized and an initial version of sales tracking software is developed and used. Later, the firm changes its sales system again to accommodate needs to track and control a larger salesforce and predict sales several quarters in advance. A subsequent iteration might involve the acquisition and configuration of CRM software. The first version of the work system starts with an initiation phase. Each subsequent iteration involves deciding that the current sales system is insufficient; initiating a project that may or may not involve significant changes in software; developing the resources such as procedures, training materials, and software that are needed to support the new version of the work system; and finally, implementing the new work system.\n\nThe pictorial representation of the work system life cycle model places the four phases at the vertices of rectangle. Forward and backward arrows between each successive pair of phases indicate the planned sequence of the phases and allow the possibility of returning to a previous phase if necessary. To encompass both planned and unplanned change, each phase has an inward facing arrow to denote unanticipated opportunities and unanticipated adaptations, thereby recognizing the importance of diffusion of innovation, experimentation, adaptation, emergent change, and path dependence.\n\nThe work system life cycle model is iterative and includes both planned and unplanned change. It is fundamentally different from the frequently cited Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which actually describes projects that attempt to produce software or produce changes in a work system. Current versions of the SDLC may contain iterations but they are basically iterations within a project. More important, the system in the SDLC is a basically a technical artifact that is being programmed. In contrast, the system in the WSLC is a work system that evolves over time through multiple iterations. That evolution occurs through a combination of defined projects and incremental changes resulting from small adaptations and experimentation. In contrast with control-oriented versions of the SDLC, the WSLC treats unplanned changes as part of a work system’s natural evolution.\n\nThe work system method (Alter, 2002; 2006; 2013) is a method that business professionals (and/or IT professionals) can use for understanding and analyzing a work system at whatever level of depth is appropriate for their particular concerns. It has evolved iteratively starting in around 1997. At each stage, the then current version was tested by evaluating the areas of success and the difficulties experienced by MBA and EMBA students trying to use it for a practical purpose. A version called “work-centered analysis” that was presented in a textbook has been used by a number of universities as part of the basic explanation of systems in organizations, to help students focus on business issues, and to help student teams communicate. Ramiller (2002) reports on using a version of the work system framework within a method for “animating” the idea of business process within an undergraduate class. In a research setting, Petrie (2004) used the work system framework as a basic analytical tool in a Ph.D. thesis examining 13 ecommerce web sites. Petkov and Petkova (2006) demonstrated the usefulness of the work system framework by comparing grades of students who did and did not learn about the framework before trying to interpret the same ERP case study. More recent evidence of the practical value of a work system approach is from Truex et al. (2010, 2011), which summarized results from 75 and later 300 management briefings produced by employed MBA students based on a work system analysis template. These briefings contained the kind of analysis that would be discussed in the initiation phase of the WSLC, as decisions were being made about which projects to pursue and how to proceed.\n\nResults from analyses of real world systems by typical employed MBA and EMBA students indicate that a systems analysis method for business professionals must be much more prescriptive than soft systems methodology (Checkland, 1999). While not a straitjacket, it must be at least somewhat procedural and must provide vocabulary and analysis concepts while at the same time encouraging the user to perform the analysis at whatever level of detail is appropriate for the task at hand. The latest version of the work system method is organized around a general problem-solving outline that includes:\n\n\nIn contrast to systems analysis and design methods for IT professionals who need to produce a rigorous, totally consistent definition of a computerized system, the work system method:\n\n\n"}

Gibson and Elaine Coffin Gibson. Her father was an efficiency expert, and her mother was an authorized Christian Science healer. She attended Wadleigh High School for Girls in New York City. \n\nAt one point during her youth, she ran away from home with a touring play troupe, acting with the group in three cities before her father found her.\n\nGibson was a member of Frederick Santley's Melody Maids and Ray Raymond's Melody Charmers. She toured in the \"Ritz Girls\" show, in which she and Billie Vernon performed a sister act. Gibson was seen in vaudeville as part of \"The Melody Charmers\". Her Broadway credits include \"Jarnegan\" (1928) and \"When You Smile\" (1925). In 1955-56, she served as chair of the Equity Library Theatre.\n\nEarly in her career, Gibson had a small part in a film but had no special interest in appearing before the camera. It was the stage that interested her and she began her stage career in chorus and was soon playing leads. She toured Europe then returned to America and tried for a dramatic part but failed and returned to musical comedy. Paramount signed her when about to film \"Nothing But the Truth\" (1929), starting her success which continued in some 50 films between 1929 and 1956 although many were B movies.\n\nGibson had a brief marriage to a stage manager. After that, she married John Gallaudet, an actor, in 1927. They divorced in 1930. She was a long-time companion of former Warner Brothers actress Beverly Roberts.\n\nGibson died in 1987 of a cerebral thrombosis in Laguna Niguel, California.\n\n"}

Studies suggest the Martian meteorite was formed about 1.3 billion years ago from a lava flow on Mars. An impact occurred on Mars about 11 million years ago and ejected the meteorite from the Martian surface into space. The meteorite landed on Earth in Antarctica about 50,000 years ago. The mass of the meteorite is and has been found to contain evidence of past water alteration.\n\nAt a microscopic level, spheres are found in the meteorite that are rich in carbon compared to surrounding areas that lack such spheres. The carbon-rich spheres and the observed micro-tunnels may have been formed by biotic activity, according to NASA scientists.\nThe 41st Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) found the meteorite in late December 2000 on the Yamato Glacier at the Queen Fabiola Mountains, Antarctica.\n\nThe mass of the meteorite is . It is an unbrecciated cumulus igneous rock consisting predominantly of elongated augite crystals —a solid solution in the pyroxene group. Japanese scientists from the National Institute of Polar Research reported in 2003 that the meteorite contains iddingsite, which forms from the weathering of basalt in the presence of liquid water. In addition, NASA researchers reported in February 2014 that they also found carbon-rich spheres encased in multiple layers of iddingsite, as well as microtubular features emanating from iddingsite veins displaying curved, undulating shapes consistent with bio-alteration textures that have been observed in terrestrial basaltic glass. However, the scientific consensus is that \"morphology alone cannot be used unambiguously as a tool for primitive life detection.\" Interpretation of morphology is notoriously subjective, and its use alone has led to numerous errors of interpretation. According to the NASA team, the presence of carbon and lack of corresponding cations is consistent with the occurrence of organic matter embedded in iddingsite. The NASA researchers indicated that mass spectrometry may provide deeper insight into the nature of the carbon, and could distinguish between abiotic and biologic carbon incorporation and alteration.\n\nThe Martian meteorite is an igneous rock classified as an achondrite type of the nakhlite group.\n\n"}
