{"id": "41205197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41205197", "title": "Adam Baworowski", "text": "Adam Baworowski\n\nAdam Baworowski (; born 9 August 1913 in Vienna – 1943 in Stalingrad) was an Austrian-Polish tennis player.\n\nCount Adam Baworowski descended from the Polish noble family \"Baworowski\". He was the son of Count Rudolf Baworowski and Austrian Countess Maria Chorynsky the former who was the Chamberlain of Franz Joseph I of Austria and had estates in Lviv and where Adam often spent his childhood years. He had three brothers and three sisters, Emil, Stefan, Rudolf, Matylda, Marya and Franciszka. He went to school in Vienna and as the family spoke German at home Adam was alienated from his Polish roots in the beginning.\n\nHe started playing tennis at a very early age and started taking coaching lessons from the Van Dycków brothers. He attended the tennis club at the Prater where he had a chance to meet Georg von Metaxa, his later Davis Cup teammate and friend. In 1927 he had a victory over Henner Henkel at the Youth Games. In 1929 at the age of 13 he already defeated then-Polish champion Maximilian Stolarow. In 1931, he won the Austrian junior tennis championships as well as the international junior championships of Berlin in singles and doubles. He was ranked tenth on the Austrian rankings. The next year he was classified fifth. While in 1934 he climbed to number four on the same list. In 1935 he won the national singles and doubles championships and drew attention with back to back straight victories against famed players Franz Wilhelm Matejka and Hermann Artens to be crowned champion. Subsequently, he rose to the second place after Matejka. Later he became member of the Wiener Park Club.\n\nHe was first drafted into the Austrian Davis Cup troupe in 1933 only for the doubles rubber teaming with Herbert Kinzl with whom he reached the doubles finals of the Sheffield tournament later that year. He played again in the Cup in 1936 along with Georg von Metaxa and reached the semifinals of the European zone. He won the Austrian Championships in the same year. He twice won the International Polish Championship of Warsaw in the doubles partnering Pat Hughes in 1933 and Hans Redl in 1937. He was twice finalist in Budapest in 1935 and 1937. In 1937 he still held the second spot on the Austrian rankings next to von Metaxa.\n\nIn 1936 he won the Capri tournament meeting Jacques Jamain in the championship match. He also won the mixed doubles with Toto Zehden. In January 1937 he lost the doubles final in Saint Moritz, playing with von Metaxa, to Frenchmen Christian Boussus and Paul Féret. In March he lost the Nice title to Kho Sin-Kie in straight sets. At the same tournament he reached the double final as well with von Metaxa. In April he clinched the Monegasque Championships by beating Marcel Bernard in a five set match. He also took the doubles title with von Metaxa defeating Daniel Prenn and Vladimir Landau. In March 1938 he was victorious at the Cannes L.T.C. tournament where he eliminated Swedish champion Karl Schroeder. Schroeder took revenge in the doubles final where he teamed up with seasoned player Jacques Brugnon of the Four Musketeers to stop the Baworowski-von Metaxa duo in a five set match.\n\nAt the French Championships, Baworowski reached the fourth round in 1937 and 1938. At Wimbledon, he lost his initial match on three occasions (1933, 1936, 1939). After the \"Anschluss\", the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany, in March 1938, Baworowski decided to join the Polish Davis Cup team as he didn't want to lose his family's estates in Poland.\n\nUpon arrival in Poland he gave a few interviews, condemning the \"Anschluss\" and the policy of the Nazi authorities. His statements were widely covered in the Western media. He joined the Legia Warsaw and on 3 May 1938 he participated in a friendly match between Poland and Germany, and a few days later played in a match in a Legia Warsaw-Stockholm meeting. He quickly moved up to second place on the list of Polish Tennis Association right behind Ignacy Tłoczyński. He was victorious again in the doubles at the Katowice tournament partnering Tłoczyński and the duo represented Poland in the Central European Cup and claimed the trophy after beating Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe last peaceful season in 1939 kicked off well for him. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sponsored Baworowski French Riviera tour and it paid off well. At Cannes he was only beaten in the final by Yvon Petra. In Juan-les-Pins he proved to be unstoppable and defeated Robert Abdesselam for the title and carried on this streak at Nice through the final against Antoine Gentien. After this great season opener he suffered injury, which affected his Davis Cup tie against Germany and in the French Championships. However he was a doubles semifinalist along with Ignacy Tłoczyński at Roland Garros. Despite his bad shape he still secured the Polish National Doubles championship alongside Tłoczyński.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, after returning from Monaco with a silver medal of the 1939 International University Games Baworowski was residing in Paris where his family lived. When he heard about the outbreak of the war he was determined to join the Polish army although his parents begged him to stay. When he arrived to the East Railway Station of Warsaw, The German Luftwaffe was already bombarding the area. The passengers fled from the trains to nearby trenches. Apparently he was successfully enlisted. The next time he met his cousin Eugene Paul Baworowski in the streets of Warsaw in the first days of occupation he was about to get in touch with the Polish Resistance. As the 6 September 1939 decree issued by the Wehrmacht command pursued every Polish citizen who reached the military age to be sent to a POW camp the Gestapo soon arrested and sent him to a camp. Only his ties to the Chorynsky noble family and to the former Austrian Tennis Federation saved him from further reprisals.\n\nIn 1941, he took part in the German war championships at Braunschweig and reached the final which he lost to Kurt Gies in five sets. He was practising in the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club of Berlin. He further represented Germany in the Danube Cup, which was a wartime substitute for the Central European Cup. Baworowski later joined the German Wehrmacht and was killed in action in the beginning of 1943 during the Battle of Stalingrad. He served as a Hauptmann. On December 21, 1942, when the Luftwaffe evacuated his troops he ceded his place on the last flight to a heavily injured soldier and decided to stay in the trenches with his subordinates. He was hit by the Soviets and died in agony without receiving any medical help. \n\nAccording to Kordian Tarasiewicz contemporary senior Polish tennis Player Baworowski was \"[...] was a well established tennis player on the European courts and represented a versatile offensive [style], especially had a well mastered game at the net\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8848752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8848752", "title": "Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon", "text": "Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon\n\nAgnes (, ; \"c\".1105–\"c\".1159) was Queen of Aragon during her brief marriage to King Ramiro II, a former monk. The couple separated after the birth of their only child, Queen Petronilla, and retired to monasteries. Agnes chose the Abbey of Fontevraud, from where she continued to take part in the affairs of her sons from her first marriage to Aimery V, Viscount of Thouars.\n\nAgnes was the daughter of William IX, Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitiers, and Philippa, Countess of Toulouse. She was the namesake of her aunt Agnes, wife of King Peter I of Aragon and Navarre. Her first marriage, to Aimery V, the viscount of Thouars, was celebrated some time prior to 9 January 1117, when the couple confirmed the possessions of the abbey of Saint-Laon de Thouars. Before Aimery's death in 1127, Agnes bore him three sons:\n\nOn 13 November 1135 in the cathedral of Jaca, the ancient capital of the Kingdom of Aragon, Agnes married King Ramiro II, a monk who had resigned the bishopric of Roda in order to succeed his childless brother Alfonso the Battler. The anonymous contemporary author of the \"Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris\" attributes the initiative in Ramiro's marriage to the Aragonese:\nThey elected Alfonso's brother king. This man was a monk, and his name was Ramiro. They gave him the sister of the Count of Poitiers for a wife. Even though this was a great sin, the Aragonese did it, for they had lost their king and hoped that there would be an offspring from the royal family. . . King Ramiro went to his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to a daughter. . . He transferred the kingdom to his daughter and acknowledged his sins. He then did penance.\nAgnes' age (approximately thirty) and proven fertility in her prior marriage were probably the main reasons the Aragonese sought her out. Agnes' brother, Duke William X, was also one of the few regional supporters of Antipope Anacletus II, who, as the weaker claimant to the papacy, might be persuaded to support Ramiro's irregular (and uncanonical) accession. Agnes' dowry was a church at Loscertales.\n\nIn a document from the same month as his marriage, Ramiro declares that he \"took a wife not out of carnal lust, but for the restoration of the blood and the lineage\" (\"uxorem quoque non carnis libidine, set sanguinis ac proienici restauratione duxi\"). Later medieval and early modern historians, embarrassed by the disregard for canon law, invented explanations to reconcile the marriage of a bishop with what was current in their own day. The fourteenth-century \"Chronicle of San Juan de la Peña\" records that messengers were sent to the pope to obtain the proper dispensation. The Aragonese translation of the same chronicle places Ramiro's religious status in doubt (\"some chronicles say that he was not in holy orders\", \"algunas cronónicas dizen que no era en sacres órdenes\"). At the Second Lateran Council in 1139, the church, perhaps influenced by the case of Ramiro and Agnes, declared the marriages of clerics to be null and void. Prior to this, they were legitimate, but illegal, marriages.\n\nThe first known royal diploma in which Agnes appears as queen is an original dated 29 January 1136. By August Agnes had born a daughter, Petronilla. Agnes' last appearance in an Aragonese document is from October 1136: a joint donation with her husband of a mill and a horse at Loscertales to the monastery of San Pedro de Antefruenzo. She and Ramiro may have separated shortly after this. Her brother died on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela on 3 April 1137. It was probably during his passage through Iberia that his consent to the proposed marriage of the infant Petronilla was obtained; there is no evidence that Agnes took any part in arranging the future of her daughter.\n\nIn a series of acts between 11 August and 13 November 1137, Ramiro betrothed his daughter to the powerful Count Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona, made his subjects swear an oath of allegiance to the count and then handed over the royal power to him. The transfer of power done, Ramiro returned to religious life and Agnes retired to the Abbey of Fontevraud, where her mother had lived. She is recorded there between 1141 and 1147, and there she died around 1159.\n\n\n"}

She murdered at least five people by poisoning them. One of her victims was her second husband, Michael Gilligan; the others were residents of her nursing home.\n\nIt is possible that she was involved in more deaths. The authorities counted 48 deaths in her nursing home, the \"Archer Home for the Elderly and Infirm.\"\n\nThe case attracted wide publicity at the time and has been cited as an inspiration for the play \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" and for Frank Capra's later film of the same name.\n\nAmy E. Duggan was born in October 1868 to James Duggan and Mary Kennedy in Milton, Connecticut, the eighth of ten children. She attended the Milton School and the New Britain Normal School in 1890.\n\nAmy Duggan married James Archer in 1897. A daughter, Mary J. Archer, was born in December 1897. The Archers first became caretakers in 1901, hired to care for John Seymour, an elderly widower. They moved into his home in Newington, Connecticut. Seymour died in 1904. His heirs converted the residence into a boarding house for the elderly, and the Archers remained to provide care for the elderly for a fee. They paid rent to Seymour's family. They ran the boarding house as Sister Amy's Nursing Home for the Elderly.\n\nIn 1907, Seymour's heirs decided to sell the house. The Archers moved to Windsor, Connecticut, and used their savings to purchase their own residence on Prospect Street in Windsor Center. They soon converted it into a business, Archer Home for the Elderly and Infirm.\n\nJames Archer died in 1910, apparently of natural causes. The official cause of his death was Bright's disease, a generic term for kidney diseases. Amy Archer had taken out an insurance policy on him a few weeks before his death. The policy benefit enabled her to continue operating Archer Home.\n\nIn 1913, Amy married Michael W. Gilligan, a widower with four adult sons. He was reportedly wealthy and interested in both Amy and in investing in the Archer Home. However, on February 20, 1914, after only three months married to Amy, Michael died. The official cause of death was \"acute bilious attack\" (in other words, severe indigestion). Amy was once again financially secure because during their short marriage her new husband had drawn up a will which left his entire estate to her. The will would later be determined a forgery as it was apparently written in handwriting matching Amy Archer-Gilligan.\n\nBetween 1907 and 1917, there were 60 deaths in the Archer Home. Relatives of her clients grew suspicious as they tallied the large number of deaths. Only 12 residents died between 1907 and 1910, but 48 residents died between 1911 and 1916. Among them was Franklin R. Andrews, an apparently healthy man. On the morning of May 29, 1914, Andrews was doing some gardening in the Archer house. His robust physical condition deteriorated in a single day and he was dead by evening. The official cause of death was gastric ulcer.\n\nAfter Andrews' siblings (including Nellie Pierce) came into possession of some of his letters, they noted occasions where Amy Archer-Gilligan was pressing their brother for money. Amy's clients showed a pattern of dying not long after giving her a large sum of money.\n\nAs the deaths continued, Nellie Pierce reported her suspicions to the local district attorney, but he mostly ignored her. So she took her story to \"The Hartford Courant\". On May 9, 1916, the first of several articles on the \"Murder Factory\" was published. A few months later, the police started to seriously investigate the case. The investigation took almost a year to complete.\n\nThe bodies of Gilligan, Andrews, and three other boarders were exhumed. All five had died of poisoning, either arsenic or strychnine. Local merchants were able to testify that Amy had been purchasing large quantities of arsenic, supposedly to \"kill rats\". A look into Gilligan's will established that it was actually a forgery written by Amy.\n\nAccording to M. William Phelps, author of \"The Devil's Rooming House\", investigation appeared to show that Amy was buying the arsenic to kill large numbers of rats. However, it appears that she did not buy all of the arsenic which killed her patients. The doctor and some of the patients had signed off to purchase it. The investigation pursued Dr. King because more evidence was piling up against him, but suspicions were focused back on Amy when someone suggested to clearly check all records of arsenic purchases.\n\nWhen evidence was found of Amy sending her patients to the drugstore to buy quantities of arsenic, the police were able to arrest and convict her.\n\nArcher-Gilligan was arrested and tried for murder, originally on five counts. Ultimately her lawyer managed to have the charges reduced to a single count, the murder of Franklin R. Andrews. On June 18, 1917, a jury found her guilty, and she was sentenced to death.\n\nArcher-Gilligan appealed and was granted a new trial in 1919. At this trial, she pleaded insanity. Mary Archer testified that her mother was addicted to morphine. Archer-Gilligan was again found guilty of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nIn 1924, Archer-Gilligan was declared to be temporarily insane and was transferred to the Connecticut Hospital for the Insane in Middletown, where she remained until her death on April 23, 1962.\n\n"}
{"id": "31464310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31464310", "title": "Assassination of Pim Fortuyn", "text": "Assassination of Pim Fortuyn\n\nPim Fortuyn, a Dutch politician, was assassinated by Volkert van der Graaf in Hilversum, North Holland on 6 May 2002, nine days before the Dutch general election of 2002.\n\nOn a few occasions, Fortuyn had expressed his fear of being murdered: after being pied at the official release of his book \"De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars\" and, most notably, on the talk show \"Jensen!\".\n\nIn court at his trial, van der Graaf, an environmental and animal rights activist, said he murdered Fortuyn to stop him from exploiting Muslims as \"scapegoats\" and targeting \"the weak members of society\" in seeking political power.\n\nFortuyn was 54 years old when he was assassinated by Volkert van der Graaf in a car park outside a radio studio where Fortuyn had just given an interview to Ruud de Wild at 3FM. The attacker was pursued by Fortuyn's driver, Hans Smolders, and was arrested shortly afterwards while still in possession of the handgun used to assassinate Fortuyn.\n\nVan der Graaf was arrested near the scene of the crime after a pursuit by witnesses. Details of the suspect were always officially reported as \"Volkert van der G.\", in accordance with unwritten Dutch privacy practice, but his full name was readily available on the internet. His home and work addresses were soon circulated on websites used by Fortuyn's supporters. Angry supporters gathered in several cities, so several people related to Van der Graaf went into hiding. His girlfriend and their daughter left their house on the evening of the murder.\n\nThe details of the murder emerged later; the accounts of the investigators and Van der Graaf were consistent. He had planned the attack using information obtained from the Internet; printouts of a map of the scene of the crime and schedules of Fortuyn's appearances were found in his car. In two boxes of cartridges found at his home, seven cartridges were missing, the exact number loaded in his gun. The attack has been described as the work of a single person, an amateur shooter who used a relatively simple plan and did not prepare a good escape route.\n\nVan der Graaf purchased his weapons illegally; a semi-automatic Star Firestar M43 pistol in a café in Ede and 9mm cartridges in The Hague. After the murder of Fortuyn, the gun was linked to a suspect in the robbery of a jeweller in Emmen through DNA material found on the weapon.\nOn the day of the murder, he attended work in the morning, taking with him a backpack containing the gun, a pair of latex gloves, a baseball cap and a pair of dark glasses. At the end of the morning, he said he was taking the afternoon off on account of the beautiful weather. He drove towards Hilversum, knowing that Fortuyn was due to be interviewed in the radio studio of 3FM in the Media Park. During the trip he stopped several times, among other things to purchase a razor to remove his stubble, which together with the cap and glasses would disguise his appearance, while the gloves would avoid leaving fingerprints. The razor did not work.\n\nHe had never visited the Mediapark, relying on a map and a couple of photos to find his way into the park on foot and to the building where Fortuyn's interview was held. Recognising Fortuyn's car in the car park, he hid in some nearby bushes, burying the gun which was in a plastic bag in a shallow trough in case he was discovered. He could hear fragments of Fortuyn's interview from a speaker on the outside of the building. He waited there for about two hours.\nFortuyn emerged from the building in the company of several others. Van der Graaf walked towards Fortuyn, passed by him, then turned and opened fire. He said that he aimed for the back to avoid Fortuyn's ducking away, or that a bullet would mistakenly hit somebody else. He held the gun in both hands, with the plastic bag around it. Less than 1.5 metres from Fortuyn, he hit him in the back and head five times, and fired a sixth shot that missed.\nRunning away, Van der Graaf was chased by Hans Smolders, Fortuyn's chauffeur. Two employees from a different building joined in. During the chase, Van der Graaf threatened them by raising the gun in his jacket pocket toward them. They ran from the grounds of the Mediapark onto a public road, where Van der Graaf pointed the pistol at arms length at Smolders. He had been reporting their position to the police by mobile phone. Reaching a petrol station, Van der Graaf gave up when police pointed their pistols at him.\n\nThe assassination shocked many in the Netherlands and exposed cultural clashes within the country. Riots broke out on the Binnenhof on the evening following the killing. Politicians from all political parties suspended campaigning, but the elections were not postponed. Under Dutch law, it was not possible to modify the ballots, so Fortuyn became a posthumous candidate. Pim Fortuyn List went on to make an unprecedented debut in the House of Representatives, winning 26 seats (17% of the 150 seats in the house). This success was short-lived. In the elections the following year, Pim Fortuyn seats dropped to eight. After the 2006 elections, the party had no seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nOn 15 April 2003, Volkert van der Graaf was convicted of assassinating Fortuyn and sentenced to 18 years in prison. He was released on parole in May 2014 after serving two-thirds of his sentence, the standard procedure under the Dutch penal system.\n\nPim Fortuyn is credited with changing the Dutch political landscape and culture with his ideology, which came to be known as Fortuynism. The 2002 elections were marked by large losses for the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and the social democratic Labour Party. Both parties replaced their leaders shortly after the election. The Pim Fortuyn List and the Christian Democratic Appeal made significant gains. There have been others that speculate Fortuyn's perceived martyrdom may have played in favor of Pim Fortuyn List.\n\nThe coalition cabinet which formed after the election of the Christian Democratic Appeal, Pim Fortuyn List and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy fell after three months, due to conflicts between Pim Fortuyn List members. In the following elections, the Pim Fortuyn List returned eight seats in the House of Representatives (out of 150) and did not form part of the new government. However, political commentators speculated that there was still a sizable number of discontented voters who might have voted for a non-traditional party, if a viable alternative was available. In recent times, the right-wing Party for Freedom, which has a strong stance on immigration and integration, won nine (out of 150) seats in the 2006 elections and 24 in the 2010 elections.\n\nIn a 2004 TV show election, Fortuyn was chosen as De Grootste Nederlander (\"Greatest Dutchman of All Time\"), followed by William the Silent, the leader of the war for independence that established the precursor to the present-day Netherlands. The validity of this election, where votes were cast online and over the phone, was questioned and dismissed as being easily influenced by Fortuyn's supporters. The murder of film director Theo van Gogh for comments critical of Islam had occurred a few days before the election and many votes for Fortuyn were attributed to this event. It later turned out that William the Silent had received more votes, many of which were not counted before Fortuyn was declared the winner, due to technical problems.\n\nAfter Fortuyn's death, the Netherlands' right-wing politicians, including former Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk and Geert Wilders, increased in profile and prominence.\nFurther, various conspiracy theories arose after Pim Fortuyn's murder that deeply affected Dutch politics and society.\n\nThe pistol used in the shooting has been donated to the Rijksmuseum, although it is not expected to be exhibited for \"several decades\".\n"}

Part of this is due to design in the world which is often right-hand biased. Handwriting is one of the biggest sources of actual disadvantage for left-handed people, other than for those forced to work with certain machinery. About ten percent of the world's population is left-handed, yet many common articles are designed for efficient use by right-handed people, and may be inconvenient, painful, or even dangerous for left-handed people to use. These may include school desks, kitchen implements, and tools ranging from simple scissors to hazardous machinery such as power saws.\n\nBeyond being inherently disadvantaged by a right-handed bias in the design of tools, left-handed people have been subjected to deliberate discrimination and discouragement. In certain societies, they may be considered unlucky or even malicious by the right-handed majority. Many languages still contain references to left-handedness to convey awkwardness, dishonesty, stupidity, or other undesirable qualities. Even in relatively advanced societies, left-handed people were historically (and in some cases still are) forced as children to use their right hands for tasks which they would naturally perform with the left, such as eating or writing.\n\nAmong Incas left-handers were called (and now are called among the indigenous peoples of the Andes) \"lloq'e\" () which has positive value. Peoples of the Andes consider left-handers to possess special spiritual abilities, including magic and healing.\n\nThe Third Sapa Inca—Lloque Yupanqui—was left-handed. His name, when translated from Quechua, means \"the glorified lefthander.\"\n\nIn the Chinese language, the character for \"left\", , depicts a left hand attending to its work. In contrast, the character for \"right\", (\"yòu\"), depicts a right hand in relation to the mouth, suggesting the act of eating.\n\nIn tantra Buddhism, the left hand represents wisdom.\n\nIn early Roman times, the left side retained a positive connotation, as the Augures proceeded from the eastern side. The negative meaning was subsequently borrowed into Latin from Greek, and ever since in all Roman languages.\n\nIn Russian, \"levsha\" (lefty, lefthander) became a common noun for skilled craftsman, after the title character from \"The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty from Tula and the Steel Flea\" written in 1881 by Nikolai Leskov.\n\nThe unfavorable associations and connotations of the use of the left hand among cultures are varied. In some areas, in order to preserve cleanliness where sanitation was an issue, the right hand, as the dominant hand of most individuals, was used for eating, handling food, and social interactions. The left hand would then be used for personal hygiene, specifically after urination and defecation. These rules were imposed on all, no matter their dominant hand. Through these practices, the left hand became known as the \"unclean\" hand. Currently, amongst Muslims and in some societies including Nepal and India it is still customary to use the left hand for cleaning oneself with water after defecating. The right hand is commonly known in contradistinction from the left, as the hand used for eating. In the film \"Lawrence of Arabia\" there is no insult taken when the guide offers his food to Lawrence and he takes it to his mouth with his left hand.\n\nIn many religions, including Christianity, the right hand of God is the favored hand. For example, Jesus sits at God's right side. God's left hand, however, is the hand of judgement. The Archangel Gabriel is sometimes called \"God's left hand\", sits at God's left side, and is one of six angels of death. Those who fall from favor with God are sent to left, as described in Matthew 25: 32–33, in which sheep represent the righteous and goats represent the fallen: \"And he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats. And he shall set the sheep on his right, but the goats on his left.\" In 19th-century Europe, homosexuals were referred to as \"left-handed\". In Protestant-majority parts of the United Kingdom, Catholics were called \"left-footers\", and vice versa in Catholic-majority parts of Ireland and Irish America. Black magic is sometimes referred to as the \"left-hand path\", which is strongly associated with Satanism.\n\nVarious innocuous activities and experiences become rude or even signs of bad luck when the left hand becomes involved. In some parts of Scotland, it is considered bad luck to meet a left-handed person at the start of a journey. In Ghana, pointing, gesturing, giving or receiving items with the left hand is considered taboo or rude. A person giving directions will put their left hand behind them and even physically strain to point with their right hand if necessary. In some Asian countries, holding eating utensils in the left hand is considered impolite.\nDue to cultural and social pressures, many left-handed children were encouraged or forced to write and perform other activities with their right hands. This conversion can cause multiple problems in the developing left-handed child, including learning disorders, dyslexia, stuttering and other speech disorders. Shifts from left- to right-handed are more likely to be successful than right to left, though neither have a high success rate to begin with. Successful shifters are more likely to become ambihanded than unsuccessful ones. Conversions can be successful with consistent daily practice in a variety of manual activities, but though activity in the non-dominant left-hemisphere of the brain will increase during tasks, so too will activity in the dominant right-hemisphere. Consistent left-handers have no higher activity in these task centers than converted left-handers, so it may be inferred that \"attempts to switch handedness by educational training far from weakening the functional expression of lefthandedness in higher-order motor areas of the (dominant) right hemisphere in fact enhance it.\"\n\nMany Asian countries encourage or force their children to become right-handed due to cultural perceptions of bad luck associated with the left hand. In India and Indonesia, it is considered rude to eat with the left hand. In a 2007 study in Taiwan, about 59.3% of children studied had been forced to convert from left-handedness to right-handedness. The study took into account economic status of the children's families and found that children whose parents had less education were more likely to be forced to convert. Even among children whose parents had higher levels of education, the conversion rate was 45.7%. Among naturally left-handed Japanese senior high school students, only 0.7% and 1.7% of individuals used their left hand for writing and eating, respectively, though young Japanese are more likely to convert to using chopsticks right-handed than forks or spoons (29.3% to 4.6%). The proportion of females subjected to forced conversion is significantly higher compared to males (95.1% to 81.0%).\n\nWestern countries have also attempted to convert left-handed children due to cultural, social and religious biases. Schools tend to urge children to use their right hands, sometimes against the wishes of the child's parents. In America some students have been physically punished for writing with their left hands (though nowadays left-handedness is more widely accepted): \"I was educated in the USA in Catholic school in the 60s. My left hand was beaten until it was swollen, so I would use my right right [sic] hand\" ... \"I had a teacher who would smack my left hand with a yardstick every time she caught me writing with my left hand\" ... \"My fourth grade teacher [...] would force me to use my right hand to perform all of my school work. If she caught me using my left hand, I was hit in the head with a dictionary. It turned out that she believed left handers were connected with Satan.\"\n\nMalawians cite their views that \"the left hand is less skilled and less powerful than the right one\" as main reasons for forcing left-handers to convert. Among students, teachers and parents, 75% said the left hand should not be used to perform habitual activities, and 87.6% of these believed left-handers should be forced to switch dominant hands. Parents and close relatives are most responsible for impressing these beliefs upon their children.\n\nOn March 8, 1971, \"The Florence Times—Tri-Cities Daily\" reported that left-handed people \"are becoming increasingly accepted and enabled to find their right (or left) place in the world.\" \"The Florence Times—Tri-Cities Daily\" also wrote \"we still have a long way to go before the last vestiges of discrimination against left-handedness are uprooted, however.\" The frequency of left-handed writing in the United States, which was only 2.1 percent in 1932, had risen to over 11 percent by 1972. According to an article by \"The Washington Post\" from August 13, 1979, a psychologist from University of Chicago named Jerre Levy said: \"In 1939, 2 percent of the population wrote with the left hand. By 1946, it was up to 7 1/2 percent. In 1968, 9 percent. By 1972, 12 percent. It's leveling off, and I expect the real number of left-handers will turn out to be about 14 percent.\" According to the article by \"The Washington Post\" from August 13, 1979, \"a University of Michigan study points out that left-handers may not be taking over the world but...7 percent of the men and 6 percent of the women over 40 who were interviewed were lefties, but the percentages jumped to well above 10 percent in the 18-to-39 age group.\" According to the article by \"The Washington Post\" from August 13, 1979, Dr. Bernard McKenna of the National Education Association said: \"There was recognition by medical authorities that left-handedness was normal and that tying the hand up in a child often caused stuttering.\" In Japan, Tokyo psychiatrist Soicki Hakozaki coped with such deep-seated discrimination against left-handed people that he wrote \"The World of Left-Handers\". Hakozaki reported finding situations in which women were afraid their husbands would divorce them for being left-handed. According to the article by \"The Washington Post\" from August 13, 1979, an official at the Japanese Embassy said: \"Before the war, there was discrimination against left-handers,\" said the official at the Japanese Embassy. \"Children were not trained to use their left hand while eating or writing. I used to throw a baseball left-handed, but my grandparents wanted me to throw right-handed. I can throw either way. Today, in some local areas, discrimination may still remain, but on the whole, it seems to be over. There are many left-handers in Japan.\" In an article by \"The Washington Post\" from December 11, 1988, Richard M. Restak wrote that left-handedness became more accepted and people decided to leave southpaws alone and decided to quit working against left-handedness. In an article by \"The Gadsden Times\" from October 3, 1993, the newspaper mentioned a 5-year-old named Daniel, writing: \"the advantage that little Daniel does have of going to school in the '90s is that he will be allowed to be left-hander. That wasn't always the case in years past.\" In a 1998 survey, 24 percent of younger-generation left-handed people reported some attempts to switch their handedness.\n\nBecause the vast majority of the world population is right-handed, most everyday items are mass-produced for ease of use with the right hand. Tools, game equipment, musical instruments and other items must be specially ordered for left-handed use, if they are even produced and are usually more expensive than their right-handed counterparts.\n\nRight-handed tools can be difficult, uncomfortable, or dangerous for left-handed people to use.\n\nFor example (right-handed) scissors are arranged so that, in the right hand, fingers and thumb push the blades together laterally, creating the shearing action essential to scissors' utility. In the left hand, however, fingers and thumb tend to force right-handed blades apart, so that, rather than being sheared, the work-material is merely hacked, as by a knife, or slips between the blades uncut. Left-handers using right-handed scissors will often try to compensate by forcing the handles apart laterally, causing discomfort or injury to the first knuckle of the thumb.\n\nIn addition, a right-handed person using right-handed scissors can easily see the cutting line, but for a left-handed user the upper blade obscures the view.\n\nMany scissors are offered as \"ambidextrous\" or \"suitable for right- or left-handed use.\" Typically, these are merely right-handed scissors with modified handles to permit use in the left hand with less discomfort, but because the blades are still arranged for right-handed use, they still won't perform quite as well in the left hand.\n\nInput devices for computers can present obstacles to left-handed operation if intended for right-handed use. Some computer set-ups have the mouse placed on the right side of the keyboard and unable to be repositioned to the left. The mouse itself is also sometimes shaped to fit the right hand better. The functions of mouse buttons, even on mice shaped to fit both hands, default to right-hand use. On two-button mice, the left button —under the index finger of a right-handed person— is the primary button, while the right button performs secondary functions. The on-screen pointers themselves are also configured for right-handed people. Most desktop operating systems allow a user to reverse the functionality of mouse buttons to accommodate left-handed use, but left-handed cursors sometimes need to be specially downloaded. Trackballs and trackpads are often shaped for right-handed use. Even with the ability to change the functionality of buttons, these devices may be difficult for left-handed use. For a left handed person there are computer mice designed for left handed use, but they are a much smaller segment of the marketplace.\n\nVideo game controllers often have the action buttons on the right with the directional controls on the left. In first-person shooters, many games default to the right pointer-finger being used to fire, simulating a right-handed person pulling the trigger of the weapon. Certain systems' layouts, such as Nintendo's Wii U and 3DS, have games in which right-handed stylus use is assumed and can cause difficulty for left-handed players.\n\nWhile European-style kitchen knives are usually symmetrical, Japanese kitchen knives have the cutting edge ground asymmetrically, having the cutting edge closer to the user's body with ratios ranging from 70–30 for the average chef's knife, to 90–10 for professional sushi chef knives; left-handed models are rare, and usually must be specially ordered or custom made. On the other hand, the majority of \"flat ground\" general-purpose knives typically have the cutting edge on the right, as with a left-handed knife, for aesthetic reasons rather than practical.\n\nOne of the few cameras ever produced for left-handers was the half-frame Yashica Samurai. Cameras predominantly have the hand grip, shutter release, film wind lever and commonly used selection buttons, switches and dials controlled by the right hand. Lens controls (where present) tend to be accessible by either hand. When an unskilled left-handed person uses a right-handed camera the hand control can be less steady and hence produce camera shake leading to poorer pictures at low shutter speeds.\n\nLeft-handed adaptations have even bridged the world of music. Left-handed string instruments are produced, including guitars and violins. Inverted trumpets are made, too. Although the trumpet's valves are normally designed to be operated with the right hand, the prevailing belief is that left-handed trumpeters are not at a significant disadvantage. The French horn, for example, is played with the left hand, yet most horn players are right-handed. Left handed drummers also set up drum kits the exact opposite to conventional right-handed setup (i.e. hi-hat on the right, bass pedal under left foot, ride cymbal to the drummer's left, etc.).\n\nA left-handed individual may be known as a southpaw, particularly in a sports context. It is widely accepted that the term originated in the United States, in the game of baseball. Ballparks are often designed so that batters are facing east, so that the afternoon or evening sun does not shine in their eyes. This means that left-handed pitchers are throwing with their south-side arm. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" lists a non-baseball citation for \"south paw\", meaning a punch with the left hand, as early as 1848, just three years after the first organized baseball game, with the note \"(orig. U.S., in Baseball).\" A left-handed advantage in sports can be significant and even decisive, but this advantage usually results from a left-handed competitor's unshared familiarity with opposite-handed opponents. Baseball is an exception since batters, pitchers, and fielders in certain scenarios are physically advantaged or disadvantaged by their handedness.\n\nIn baseball, due to the direction in which curveballs and sliders break, it is generally accepted that the pitcher has an advantage when his handedness is the same as the batter's, and the batter has an advantage when they are opposite. For this reason, many baseball teams include a left-handed specialist pitcher, who is brought into the game specifically to pitch to dangerous left-handed batters in crucial situations. A left-handed first baseman uses a more fluid motion to tag out a baserunner returning to first base during a pickoff attempt by the pitcher and has less difficulty avoiding baserunners while presenting their mitt as a target for other fielders to throw to. It is very uncommon to see a left-handed player playing any infield position other than pitcher or first basemen due to the counterclockwise flow of the game when throwing the ball around the bases. A fielder's handedness is either a physical advantage or hindrance for similar reasons throughout the infield positions, and left-handedness is not always the more desirable dexterousness.\n\nLeft-handed bowlers are usually at an advantage during ten-pin bowling competition when hooking the ball into the pins from the left side of the lane. As there are fewer left-handed players, the lane's left side is not used as much, and thus the applied oil pattern does not change as quickly as it does for right-handed bowlers.\n\nIn boxing, someone who boxes left-handed is frequently referred to as southpaw. The term is also used to refer to a stance in which the boxer places the right foot in front of the left, so it is possible for a right-handed boxer to box with a southpaw stance. Most boxers, southpaw or otherwise, tend to train with sparring partners who adopt an orthodox stance which gives southpaws an advantage. Manny Pacquiao is an example of a southpaw (although he writes with his right hand). In the popular boxing film series \"Rocky\", the main character Rocky Balboa is a southpaw. Southpaw is also a term in professional wrestling, often giving them the advantage.\n\nFencing weapons feature left- and right-handed grips, and a left-handed fencer's stance is opposite that of a right-handed opponent. Although commonly asserted that left-handed fencers have an advantage over right-handed opponents because the line of defence favors their sword arm, this assertion describes both fencers in a mixed-handed duel, so neither competitor has a unique physical advantage. Thus the left-hander's advantage in fencing stems mostly from a right-hander's unfamiliarity with a left-handed stance.\n\nThe game of golf is most commonly played right-handed, and left-handed players typically must provide their own special golf clubs. The game can be played with both hands, provided the player has both left- and right-handed clubs, giving an advantage over one-handed players. Professional golfer Phil Mickelson plays left-handed though he is naturally right-handed.\n\nIn tennis, southpaws hold the racket in their left hand. Because of this, their grip of the handle is supposedly adjusted in a slightly different style from right-handed players. Some world champion left-handed tennis players include Jimmy Connors, Guillermo Vilas, John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Marcelo Ríos, Goran Ivanišević and Rafael Nadal.\n\nOften the playing cards have their pips printed only in the upper left corner assuming holding them with right hand. Such design may be uncomfortable for left-handed people who may prefer all four corners of the card to be used.\n\nThe vast majority of firearms are designed for right-handed shooters, with the operating handle, magazine release, or safety mechanisms set up for manipulation by the right hand, and fired cartridge cases ejected to the right. Also, scopes and sights may be mounted in such a way as to require the shooter to place the rifle against the right shoulder. A left-handed shooter must either purchase a left-handed or ambidextrous firearm (which are manufactured in smaller numbers and are generally more expensive and/or harder to obtain), shoot a right-handed gun left-handed (which presents certain difficulties, such as the controls being improperly located for the left hand or hot shell cases being ejected towards the shooter's body, especially the eyes or down the collar or right sleeve), or learn to shoot right-handed (which may be less comfortable or \"natural\"). A related issue is ocular dominance, due to which left-handed people may wish to shoot right-handed, and vice versa. Ocular dominance plays more of a rule in shooting accuracy than does left versus right handiness. Therefore, ocular dominance will cause a preference on how a shooter chooses to hold a gun.\n\nSome modern firearms are ambidextrous (e.g. the FN P90 and Heckler & Koch P7), or can be converted between right- and left-handed operation (e.g. the Heckler & Koch G36 and Steyr AUG). Bullpup rifles are particularly problematic for left-handers unless they can be reconfigured, since empty shells would be ejected straight into the shooter's face and cheek potentially causing injury, or otherwise designed from the ground up for ambidextrous use, often by way of complex ejection systems as seen on the FN F2000 and the Kel-Tec RFB. The British L85 Assault Rifle must be fired right-handed, placing left-handed soldiers at a disadvantage. In contrast, the Steyr AUG is of a modular design and the ejection port and extractor can be switched/replaced to suit the handedness of the soldier operating it. The M-16 and its variants have a fixed ejection port, but being a conventional (i.e. not bullpup) design the ejection port is forward of the operator and hence able to be fired either-handed. Circa 1985, with the introduction of the M16A2 version, a case deflector was incorporated adjacent to the ejector port to direct discarded shells in a more forward direction, making the rifle even more left hand operator friendly. The deflector is not always effective, however, as the ejected shell still stands a chance of hitting the left-handed shooter's cheek, especially in windy conditions.\n\nLever action and pump action firearms present fewer difficulties for left-handers than bolt action weapons do. Many weapons with adjustable sights allow for left-handed use, but for a right eye dominant shooter it is necessary to adjust. In fact, most weapons adjust well enough that a weapon will not eject shells into a left-hander's eye.\n\nPower tools, machinery and other potentially dangerous equipment is typically manufactured with the right-handed user in mind. Common problems faced by left-handed operators include the inability to keep materials steady, and difficulty reaching the on/off switch, especially in emergency situations. Table saws, whose blades protrude from the top of a table and pose the risk of losing fingers or hands, have their cutting area on the right side. This makes it difficult for a left-handed operator to guide the material being cut, as it must be pushed to the right side to align with the fence to avoid kickback. On bandsaws, the blade teeth are on the left side of the blade, necessitating the material being cut to be pushed from the left side of the machine. However, at this angle, the casing of the machine containing the rest of the blade is on the operator's left side, making it extremely difficult to guide the wood with their left hand.\n\nHandheld circular saws are made almost exclusively for right-handers, with the motor and grip on the right side. If held in the left hand, it is impossible for the operator to see what they are cutting. Tool manufacturer Porter-Cable produces a left-handed circular saw that can be purchased relatively inexpensively.\n\nHistorically, the left side, and subsequently left-handedness, was considered negative. The word \"left\" itself derives from the Anglo-Saxon word \"lyft\", \"weak\". In Ancient Greek both words meaning \"left\" were euphemisms: the word ἀριστερός, \"aristerós\" (the standard word in Modern Greek as well) is derived from ἂριστος, \"áristos\", \"best\", and the word εὺώνυμος, \"euōnymos\", \"of good name\", is another euphemism used in lieu of \"ill-named\". The Latin adjective \"sinister/sinistra/sinistrum\" originally meant \"left\" but took on meanings of \"evil\" or \"unlucky\" by the Classical Latin era, and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, and in the English word \"sinister\". Alternatively, \"sinister\" comes from the Latin word \"sinus\" meaning \"pocket\": a traditional Roman toga had only one pocket, located on the left side. The right hand has historically been associated with skill: the Latin word for right-handed is \"dexter\", as in \"dexterity\", meaning manual skill. Even the word \"ambidexterity\" reflects the bias. Its intended meaning is \"skillful on both sides\". However, since it keeps the Latin root \"dexter\", which means \"right\", it ends up conveying the idea of being \"right-handed on both sides\". This bias is also apparent in the lesser-known antonym \"ambisinistrous\", which means \"left-handed [\"i.e.\", clumsy] on both sides\". In more technical contexts, \"sinistral\" may be used in place of \"left-handed\" and \"sinistrality\" in place of \"left-handedness\". In both Ancient Greek and Roman religion, auspices (usually the flight paths of birds, as observed by a bird-diviner, or \"augur\") were thought to be unfavorable if appearing on the diviner's left-hand side and favorable if on the right: an ancient custom mentioned in Homer's Iliad and of apparently Middle Eastern origin (as attested in the Amarna correspondence, in which a king of Alashiya, i.e. Cyprus, requests an eagle-diviner from the Pharaoh of Egypt).\n\nMeanings gradually developed from use of these terms in the ancient languages. In many modern European languages, including English, the word for the direction \"right\" also means \"correct\" or \"proper\", and also stands for authority and justice.\n\nIn Sanskrit, the word \"वाम\" (waama)\nstands for both \"left\" and \"wicked.\"\nIn most Slavic languages the root \"prav\" (right) is used in words carrying meanings of correctness or justice. In colloquial Russian the word \"левый (levyĭ)\" \"left\" means unofficial, counterfeit, strange. In Polish, the word \"prawo\" means \"right\" as well as \"law\", \"prawy\" means: lawful; the word \"lewy\" means \"left\" (opposite of right), and colloquially \"illegal\" (opposite of legal).\n\nIn French, \"droit(e)\" (cognate to English \"direct\") means both \"right\" and \"straight\", as well as \"law\" and the legal sense of \"right\", while \"gauche\" means \"left\" and is also a synonym of \"maladroit\", literally \"not right\", meaning \"clumsy\". Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and German have similar constructs. The Spanish term \"diestro\" and the Italian term \"destro\" mean both \"right-handed\" and \"skillful\". The contemporary Italian word \"sinistra\" has both meanings of sinister and left (the masculine adjective for sinister being \"sinistro\"), and \"maldestro\" means \"clumsy\". The Spanish \"siniestra\" has both, too, although the \"left\" meaning is less common and is usually expressed by \"izquierda\", a Basque word that made its way into Portuguese as well. In some Spanish-speaking countries, to do something \"por izquierda\" means to engage in corrupt conduct or employ illegitimate means, whereas \"por derecha\" or \"a derechas\" means to do it the right (legitimate) way. Also, in Spanish, to tell someone \"Eres tan zurdo\" means that they are being clumsy, though the literal meaning is \"You're so lefty.\" In Portuguese, the most common word for left-handed person, \"canhoto\", was once used to identify the devil, and \"canhestro\", a related word, means \"clumsy\".\n\nIn Romanian \"drept/dreaptă\" (coming from Latin \"directus\") means both \"right\" and \"straight\". The word for \"left\" is \"stâng/stângă\" coming from Latin \"stancus\" (= \"stanticus\") meaning \"tired\".\n\nIn German, \"recht\" means \"right\" in both the adjectival sense (correct) and the nominal (legal entitlement). The word for \"left\" is \"links\", and is closely related to both \"link\" (underhand, questionable), and \"linkisch\" (clumsy).\n\nThe Dutch words for \"left\" (\"links, linker\") and \"right\" (\"recht, rechts, rechter\") have much the same meanings and connotations as in English. The adjective \"link\" means \"cunning, shifty\" or \"risky\". A \"linkerd\" is a \"crafty devil\". To look at someone over the left shoulder (\"iemand over de linkerschouder aanzien\") is to regard him or her as insignificant.\n\nIn Irish, \"deas\" means \"right side\" and \"nice\". \"Ciotóg\" is the left hand and is related to \"ciotach\" meaning \"awkward\"; \"ciotógach\" (kyut-OH-goch) is the term for left-handed. In Welsh, the word \"chwith\" means \"left\", but can also mean \"strange\", \"awkward\", or \"wrong\". The Scots term for left-handedness is \"corrie fistit\". The term can be used to convey clumsiness.\n\nIn Finnish, the word \"oikea\" means both \"right\" (okay, correct) and \"right\" (the opposite of left).\n\nIn Swedish, \"att göra något med vänsterhanden\" (literally \"to do something with your left hand\") means \"to do something badly\". In Swedish, \"vänster\" means \"left\". The term \"vänsterprassel\" means \"infidelity\", \"adultery\" and \"cheating\". From this term the verb \"vänstra\" is derived.\n\nIn Hungarian, the word for right is \"jobb\", which also means \"better\". The word for left is \"bal\", which also means \"bad\". In Estonian, the word \"pahem\" stands for both \"left\" and \"worse\" and the word \"parem\" stands for both \"right\" and \"better\".\n\nIn Turkish, the word for right is \"sağ\", which means \"alive\". The word for left is \"sol\", which means \"discolor\", \"die\", \"ill\".\n\nIn Chinese culture, the adjective \"left\" (Chinese character: , Mandarin: \"zuǒ\") sometimes means \"improper\" or \"out of accord\". For instance, the phrase \"left path\" (, \"zuǒdào\") stands for unorthodox or immoral means.\n\nIn Korean, the word for right is \"oreun\" (오른), to be compared to the word meaning morally proper, \"orheun\" (옳은) which shares the same pronunciation.\n\nIn Hebrew, as well as in other ancient Semitic and Mesopotamian languages, the term \"left\" was a symbol of power or custody. There were also examples of left-handed assassins in the Old Testament (Ehud killing the Moabite king). The left hand symbolized the power to shame society, and was used as a metaphor for misfortune, natural evil, or punishment from the gods. This metaphor survived ancient culture and was integrated into mainstream Christianity by early Catholic theologians, such as Ambrose of Milan, to modern Protestant theologians, such as Karl Barth, to attribute natural evil to God in explaining God's omnipotence over the universe.\n\nThe left side is often associated with awkwardness and clumsiness. The Spanish expression \"tener dos pies izquierdos\", in English, the expression \"to have two left feet\", refers to clumsiness in the domains of football or dancing. A \"left-handed compliment\" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. The Polish expression \"\"mieć dwie lewe ręce\", Dutch \"twee linkerhanden hebben\", German \"zwei linke Hände haben\", the Bulgarian expression \"dve levi ratse\", French \"avoir deux mains gauches\", Hungarian \"kétbalkezes\" and Czech \"Mít obě ruce levé\"\" all mean \"to have two left hands\"—that one is clumsy or is a very poor handyman; the English equivalent is \"to be all thumbs\". Moreover, the German idiom \"\"mit dem linken Fuß aufgestanden sein\", the Spanish expression \"levantarse con el pie izquierdo\", the French expression \"s'être levé du pied gauche\" and the Hungarian expression \"bal lábbal kelt fel\"\" (literally, to get up with the left foot) mean to have a bad day and do everything wrong or unsuccessfully, related to the English expression \"to get up on the wrong side of the bed\". The Welsh phrase \"tu chwith allan\" (left side out) refers to an object being inside-out. In Russian, the use of the term \"nalyevo\" means \"on the left\", but can also connote taking bribes or \"sneaky\" behavior. \"Balszerencse\" (lit. \"left luck\") is Hungarian for \"bad luck\".\n\nThere are many colloquial terms used to refer to a left-handed person, e.g. \"southpaw\" (USA). Some are just slang or jargon words, while other references may be offensive or demeaning, either in context or in origin. In some parts of the English-speaking world, \"cack-handed\" is slang for left-handed, and is also used to mean clumsy. The origin of this term is disputed, but some suggest it is derived from the Latin \"cacare\", in reference to the habit of performing ablutions with the left hand, leaving the right hand \"clean\". However, other sources suggest that it is derived from the Old Norse word \"keikr\", meaning \"bent backwards\". Australians frequently use \"cacky-handed\". A less common Australian slang word for a left-handed individual is the term \"Molly-Dooker\", whose origins cannot be determined with certainty.\n\nLeft-handed people who speak Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Hebrew or any other right-to-left script do not have the same difficulties with writing. The right-to-left nature of these languages prevents left-handers from running their hand on the ink as happens with left-to-right languages. Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, it is considered easier to write the Latin alphabet with the right hand than with the left. Furthermore, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the person in question.\n\nLeft-to-right alphabets can be written smudge-free and in proper \"forward slant\" with the left hand if the paper is turned 1/4 turn clockwise (90 degrees to the right), and the left hand is drawn toward the body on forward strokes, and left to right on upward strokes (as expressed in directionality of the text). It is also possible to do calligraphy in this posture with the left hand, but using right-handed pen nibs. Otherwise, left-handed pen nibs are required in order to get the thick-to-thin stroke shapes correct for most type faces, and the left-handed calligrapher is very likely to smudge the text. Left-handed pen nibs are not generally easy to find, and strokes may have to be done backwards from traditional right-handed calligraphic work rules to avoid nib jamming and splatter. Left-handed people have an advantage in learning 19th-century copperplate hands, which control line-width by pressure on the point.\n\nAs the majority of students in public schools are right-handed, most commonly used implements are designed for the right-handed, from pencil sharpeners to scissors to desks. The consequences to left-handed students can vary from decreased academic performance or physical ailments to nothing at all.\n\nIn many classrooms and lecture halls, desks are designed so that the writing surface is attached to the chair instead of separate from it. In this design, the desk is attached on the right side, offering an armrest for right-handed people to use while writing. In some of these desks, the writing surface does not extend fully to the left, necessitating a left-handed user to turn their body in order to write properly, sometimes causing back, neck and shoulder problems. This contorted posture may also cause the student to be accused of cheating. In some cases, however, large lecture halls will use left-handed desks on the left-most column of each section so that left-handed people can comfortably write without bumping against a neighbor.\n\nThis right-handed bias is reflected in standardized tests as well. Multiple-choice tests tend to put the question on the left side of the page and the answers on the right side. If the answers must be filled in in a separate booklet, it can be awkward and uncomfortable for a left-handed student to line up the booklet with the answers. The time it takes to find a comfortable, convenient position cuts into test-taking time, resulting in rushed answers and unchecked work.\n\nIn Vietnam, schools officially require students to write with their right hands, and some teachers of Grade 1 (when writing is taught) would implement that rule by deducting points from tests written by the left hand. The Civic Education textbook for grade 6 mentions a student thanking her old teacher for helping her write with her right hand, and stopping her from using her left hand to write.\n\nIn research done on the relations of handedness and employment, researchers may start their experiments believing left-handers earn lower wages than their right-handed counterparts, due to effects like difficulty using right-handed tools and increased rate of illness among left-handed people. However, their findings are more complex. In studies in the United States and United Kingdom, it was found that left-handed men earn more than right-handed men; about 5% more in the UK. Conversely, left-handed women earn about 7.5% less than right-handed women.\n\n\n"}

Actual practice has revealed a wide range of behaviors which may or may not conform to these standards.\n\nThe American Chiropractic Association (ACA) has a \"Code of Ethics\" \"based upon the acknowledgement that the social contract dictates the profession’s responsibilities to the patient, the public, and the profession; and upholds the fundamental principle that the paramount purpose of the chiropractic doctor's professional services shall be to benefit the patient.\" The smaller International Chiropractor's Association (ICA) also has a detailed set of professional canons.\n\nVarious situations have occurred in which the ethics of chiropractors and chiropractic organizations have been called into question.\n\nA 2008 commentary proposed that the chiropractic profession actively regulate itself to combat abuse, fraud, and quackery, which are more prevalent in chiropractic than in other health care professions, violating the social contract between patients and physicians.\n\nGleberzon \"et al.\" identify \"deliberate fraud\" as a notably harmful element of the chiropractic profession, finding that dubious practice techniques can translate into \"outlandish billing and utilization rates\". Those at the \"fringe of ethical behavior\" present the profession with a challenge, they believe, and must be weeded out.\n\nA study of California disciplinary statistics during 1997–2000 reported 4.5 disciplinary actions per 1000 chiropractors per year, compared to 2.27 for medical doctors, and the incident rate for fraud was nine times greater among chiropractors (1.99 per 1000 chiropractors per year) than among medical doctors (0.20). According to a 2006 Gallup poll of U.S. adults, when asked how they would \"rate the honesty and ethical standards of people in these different fields\", chiropractic compared unfavorably with mainstream medicine. When chiropractic was rated, it \"rated dead last amongst healthcare professions\". While 84% of respondents considered nurses' ethics \"very high\" or \"high,\" only 36% felt that way about chiropractors. Other healthcare professions ranged from 38% for psychiatrists, to 62% for dentists, 69% for medical doctors, 71% for veterinarians, and 73% for druggists or pharmacists. Similar results were found in the 2003 Gallup Poll.\n\nIn 2001, the largest chiropractic associations in the U.S. and Canada were reported to have distributed patient brochures which contained unsubstantiated claims. Chiropractors, especially in America, have a reputation for unnecessarily treating patients. In many circumstances the focus seems to be put on economics instead of health care. Sustained chiropractic care is promoted as a preventative tool, but unnecessary manipulation could possibly present a risk to patients. Some chiropractors are concerned by the routine unjustified claims chiropractors have made. A 2010 analysis of chiropractic websites found the majority of chiropractors and their associations made claims of effectiveness not supported by scientific evidence, while 28% of chiropractic websites advocate lower back pain care, which has some sound evidence.\n\nAlthough in the vast majority of US States chiropractors are considered physicians pursuant to statute (exceptions are \"inter alia\", New York and California). The Joint Commission recognizes chiropractors as physicians as well. In some jurisdictions, like New Zealand, chiropractors appeared to have used the title 'doctor' in a New Zealand yellow pages telephone directory in a way that implied they are registered medical practitioners, when no evidence was presented it was true. In New Zealand, chiropractors are allowed to use the title 'doctor' when it is qualified to show that the title refers to their chiropractic role. A representative from the NZ Chiropractic Board states that entries in the yellow pages under the heading of 'Chiropractors' fulfills this obligation when suitably qualified. If a chiropractor is not a registered medical practitioner, then the misuse of the title 'doctor' while working in healthcare will not comply with the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003.\n\nUK chiropractic organizations and their members make numerous claims which are not supported by scientific evidence. Many chiropractors adhere to ideas which are against science and most seemingly violate important principles of ethical behaviour on a regular basis. The advice chiropractors gave to their patients is often misleading and dangerous. In 2009, a backlash to the libel suit filed by the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) against Simon Singh, has inspired the filing of formal complaints of false advertising against more than 500 individual chiropractors within one 24-hour period, prompting the McTimoney Chiropractic Association to write to its members advising them to remove leaflets that make claims about whiplash and colic from their practice, to be wary of new patients and telephone inquiries, and telling their members: \"If you have a website, take it down NOW.\" and \"Finally, we strongly suggest you do NOT discuss this with others, especially patients.\" An editorial in \"Nature\" has suggested that the BCA may be trying to suppress debate and that this use of British libel law is a burden on the right to freedom of expression, which is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. The libel case ended with the BCA withdrawing its suit in 2010.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16388799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16388799", "title": "Christopher Levett", "text": "Christopher Levett\n\nCapt. Christopher Levett (15 April 1586 – 1630) was an English writer, explorer and naval captain, born at York, England. He explored the coast of New England and secured a grant from the King to settle present-day Portland, Maine, the first European to do so. Levett left behind a group of settlers at his Maine plantation in Casco Bay, but they were never heard from again. Their fate is unknown. As a member of the Plymouth Council for New England, Levett was named the Governor of Plymouth in 1623 and a close adviser to Capt. Robert Gorges in his attempt to found an early English colony at Weymouth, Massachusetts, which also failed. Levett was also named an early governor of Virginia in 1628, according to Parliamentary records at Whitehall.\n\nLevett was the son of Elizabeth and Percival Levett, a York merchant and innkeeper, and was admitted a freeman of York as a merchant himself. Levett was also admitted to the Company of Merchant Adventurers in the City of York, along with his brother Percival. There is evidence that the English attempts to colonise North America caught Levett's interest even while a York merchant. Rev. Alexander Whitaker, an early Anglican minister and English immigrant to the Virginia Colony made note in his will of 1610 that he owed a debt of some £5 to \"Christopher Levite, a linen draper of the city of York.\"\n\nPerhaps Levett's contact with Whitaker and other Englishmen stoked his zeal to become an explorer. Levett apparently grew restless, and instead turned his sights towards a career as an explorer. He served as His Majesty's Woodward of Somersetshire to King James I, and wrote a tract on timber harvesting that became the standard for selection of trees for the Royal Navy.\n\nLater, operating from his adopted home in Sherborne, Dorset, in the shadow of Sir Walter Raleigh and other adventurers, Levett became interested in the colonisation of New England. Levett became associated with Sir Ferdinando Gorges and was appointed to the Council for New England. He was granted of land by King James I of England for a settlement in present-day Maine, which Levett proposed to call \"York\" after his birth city.\n\nOn 5 May 1623, records for the Council on New England say, \"Christopher Levett to be a principal patentee; and to have a grant of of land.\" The next month, on 26 June 1623, the records note \"the King judges well of the undertaking in New England, and more particularly of a design of Christopher Levett, one of the Council for settling that plantation, to build a city and call it York.\" The King proclaimed that Anglican churches across England should take up collections to add Levett in his settlement attempts.\n\nLevett was helped with his settlement ambitions, according to some historians, thanks to a deepening friendship with George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, the favoured courtier who acted as advocate for the young Yorkshireman. Levett's alliance to a powerful patron probably accounted for Levett's move to Sherborne and his appointment in the Royal forest in Somersetshire, putting him closer to Gorges and other early adventurers.\n\nOn 26 June 1623, Secretary of State Lord Conway wrote to Lord Scrope, President of the Council of the North, urging him to assist Levett in his plan to settle a plantation in New England with a company of Yorkshiremen and found \"a Citty and call it by the name of Yorke.\" Noted the historian Charles Herbert Levermore: \"So the first New York that was planned for America was to be located in Portland harbor.\"\n\nOblivious to the high-flying spiritual message of early Puritan founders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, his partner John Mason and other merchant adventurers zeroed in on profit. From what we know of Levett, he seems more nuanced: his dealings with Native Americans seem solicitous, especially given the era, and his first wife was the daughter of a prominent Puritan rector.\n\nNevertheless, either out of an explorer's zeal or a businessman's gimlet eye, Levett forged ahead. To further his plans, the Naval captain embarked from England on a trip to explore the coast of New England, paying particular attention to present-day Maine and New Hampshire.\n\nWhen he returned to England, he wrote a book called \"A Voyage into New England, Begun in 1623, and Ended in 1624, Performed by Christopher Levett, His Majesty's Woodward of Somersetshire, and One of the Council of New England.\" It was Levett's hope to stir settlement in the New World, and he hoped as the principal patentee (and first settler) of present-day Portland, Maine, to benefit financially from the arrangement.\n\nOn the surface, Capt. Levett seemed ideally placed to push such settlement. \"When \"A Description of New England\" was published in London in 1616,\" write Charles and Samuella Shain of Capt. John Smith's book, \"it was only a question of time before another enterprising spirit would arrive who would realize Captain John Smith's plans for founding a permanent settlement on the Maine coast... Better placed socially and therefore politically than John Smith, Levett was also richer.\"\n\nLevett apparently had his eye on New England's thriving fisheries, which English merchants had exploited for years. The naval captain reported to Gorges that with the region's best fishing in the winter months, settling a permanent colony would enable the merchant adventurers to double their profits, by enabling the ships to fish yearround.\n\nBut despite his better connections, the tide of history was not in his favour. His salesmanship fell short. Public interest waned, as new settlements in Virginia and elsewhere took center stage. King Charles I's growing problems ate away at interest in colonisation. The King's appeal for money in Yorkshire parishes to support the Levett scheme never yielded much. The gathering storm of Roundhead rebellion put Levett's benefactors under strain.\n\nIn the meantime Levett was assigned to more pressing matters in England. On 5 October 1625, Capt. Levett was at the helm of HMS \"Susan and Ellen\" as part of Lord Wimbledon's fleet of 80 English and 16 Dutch vessels sailing against the Spanish fleet at Cadiz. The expedition, mounted by King Charles I who pressured his subjects to fund it, was an abject failure, and the fleet returned to England in disgrace. Levett later complained bitterly of the experience, claiming that even as a Royal Navy captain, he'd been treated \"no better than a meare slave\" by those in charge.\n\nLevett never returned to Maine, and the small group of men he left behind in a stone house were never heard from again. Levett's patented lands eventually passed to a group of Plymouth merchants as Levett's attention was diverted to more pressing Naval matters. Eventually Levett returned to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where he met with Governor John Winthrop in 1630, and he died aboard the return voyage home. The body of the early adventurer was buried at sea, and his wife was forced to appear at a Bristol court the following year to recover his effects.\n\nFort Levett on Cushing Island, Maine in Portland Harbor is named for this early explorer. Present-day York County, Maine, derives its name from Capt. Levett's early appellation for his Maine settlement.\n\nEven in death, Capt. Levett could not avoid the controversies roiling the age. Letters he carried aboard the vessel\" Porcupine\", addressed by John Winthrop and other leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony to sympathetic friends in England, fell into the hands of Puritan foes in England, apparently after Levett's possessions were searched after his death. The letters stirred up some measure of controversy in England for the unfavorable stance the writers took toward the English church.\n\nCapt. Levett had six children, four by his first wife Mercy More, who was the daughter of Rev. Robert More, a Puritan rector in Guiseley, Yorkshire. He married a second time to Frances Lottisham, daughter of Oliver Lottisham of Somersetshire, and by her he had another two children. A son, Jeremiah (Jeremy), graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, and became the rector of Leyton, Essex. His daughter Sarah married the Right Rev. Robert Hitch, Rector of Normanton, West Yorkshire and later Dean of York.\n\n"}

{"id": "6109180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6109180", "title": "Differential adhesion hypothesis", "text": "Differential adhesion hypothesis\n\nDifferential adhesion hypothesis (DAH) is a hypothesis that explains cellular movement during morphogenesis with thermodynamic principles. In DAH tissues are treated as liquids consisting of mobile cells whose varying degrees of surface adhesion cause them to reorganize spontaneously to minimize their interfacial free energy. Put another way, according to DAH, cells move to be near other cells of similar adhesive strength in order to maximize the bonding strength between cells and produce a more thermodynamically stable structure. In this way the movement of cells during tissue formation, according to DAH, parodies the behavior of a mixture of liquids. Although originally motivated by the problem of understanding cell sorting behavior in vertebrate embryos, DAH has subsequently been applied to explain several other morphogenic phenomena.\n\nThe origins of DAH can be traced back to a 1955 study by Philip L. Townes and Johannes Holtfreter. In this study Townes and Holtfreter placed the three germ layers of an amphibian into an alkaline solution, allowing them to dissociate into individual cells, and mixed these different types of cells together. Cells of different species were used to be able to visually observe and follow their movements. Cells of similar types migrated to their correct location and reaggregated to form germ layers in their developmentally correct positions. This experiment demonstrated that tissue organization can occur independent of the path taken, implying that it is mediated by forces that are persistently present and doesn't arise solely from the chronological sequence of developmental events preceding it.\n\nFrom these results Holtfreter developed his concept of selective affinity, and hypothesized that well-timed changes to selective affinity of cells to one another throughout development guided morphogenesis. Several hypotheses were introduced to explain these results including the \"timing hypothesis\" and the \"differential surface contraction hypothesis\". In 1964 Malcolm Steinberg introduced the \"differential adhesion hypothesis\" which uses thermodynamic principles to describe and explain patterns of cell sorting and arrangement observed.\n\nAccording to DAH, cellular movement and assortment is governed by the spontaneous rearrangement of cells—in much the same way as a liquid—to a more thermodynamically stable equilibrium. This is achieved by maximizing the amount of energy that is utilized adhering the cells together, which decreases the free energy available in the system. As cells with similar strengths of surface adhesion bond to one another, bonding energy in the overall system increases, and interfacial free energy decreases causing the system to be more thermodynamically stable. Liquids behave in a comparable manner, but with molecules moving around due to kinetic energy instead of motile cells moving around due to a combination of their kinetics and active movement.\n\nThis allows examples of tissue arrangement to be corresponded to the behavior of liquids, such as one tissue spreading across another being corresponded to oil spreading across water; the oil spreads across the water to minimize weak oil-water interactions and maximize stronger water-water and oil-oil interactions, the cells similarly sort themselves to be near other cells of similar adhesive strength and bond with them. Other tissue interactions that DAH offers an explanation for includes tissue hierarchy, where tissues with weaker surface adhesion surround tissues with stronger surface adhesion, the rounding of irregular cell masses to become spherical, and the cell sorting and construction of anatomical structures that occurs independent of the path taken.\n\nDAH does not rely on qualitative differences in cell adhesion, only on quantitative differences in the strength of their surface adhesion. DAH has been supported experimentally and by computational models.\n\nSince its original formulation in the context of vertebrate embryogenesis, DAH has been utilized to offer an explanation for several other morphogenic phenomena including wound healing, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer progression and metastasis.\n"}
{"id": "23665572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23665572", "title": "Dispersal vector", "text": "Dispersal vector\n\nA dispersal vector is an agent of biological dispersal that moves a dispersal unit, or organism, away from its birth population to another location or population in which the individual will reproduce. These dispersal units can range from pollen to seeds to fungi to entire organisms. \n\nThere are two types of dispersal vector, those that are active and those that are passive. Active dispersal involves organisms that are capable of movement under their own energy. In passive dispersal, the organisms have evolved dispersal units, or propagules, that use the kinetic energy of the environment for movement. In plants, some dispersal units have tissue that assists with dispersal and are called \"diaspores\". Some dispersal is self-driven (autochory), such as using gravity (barochory), and does not rely on external vectors. Other types of dispersal are due to external vectors, which can be biotic vectors, such as animals (zoochory), or abiotic vectors, such as the wind (anemochory) or water (hydrochory).\n\nIn many cases, organisms will be dispersed by more than one vector before reaching it's final destination. It is often a combination of two or more modes of dispersal that act together to maximize dispersal distance, such as wind blowing a seed into a nearby river, that will carry it farther down stream.\n\n\"Main article:\" Seed dispersal \n\nAutochory is the dispersal of diaspores, which are dispersal units consisting of seeds or spores, using only the energy provided by the diaspore or the parent plant. The plant of origin is the dispersal vector itself, instead of an external vector. There are four main types of autochory that act on diaspores: ballochory, or violent ejection by the parent organism; blastochory, where a diaspore crawls along the ground using stolons; barochory, the use of gravity for dispersal; and herpochory, crawling using hygroscopic hairs called trichomes . \n\nIn some cases, ballochory can be more effective when utilizing a secondary dispersal vector: ejecting the seeds in order for them to use wind or water for longer distance dispersal. \n\nAnimal-mediated dispersal is called zoochory. Zoochory can be further described by which animal is acting as a dispersal vector. Animals are an important dispersal vector because they provide the ability to transfer dispersal units longer distances than their parent organism can. The main groups include dispersal by birds (Ornithochory), dispersal by ants (Myrmekochory), dispersal by mammals (Mammaliochory), dispersal by amphibians or reptiles, and dispersal by insects, such as bees. \n\nAnimals are also a large contributor to pollination via Zoophily. Flowering plants overwhelmingly are pollinated by animals, and while invertebrates are involved in the majority of that pollination, birds and mammals also play a role. \n\nBirds contribute to seed dispersal in several ways that are unique from general vectors. Birds often cache, or store, the seeds of trees and shrubs for later consumption; only some of these seeds are later recovered and eaten, so many of the seeds are able to utilize the behavior of seed caching to allow them to germinate away from the mother tree . \n\nLong-distance dispersal, which is rare for a parent plant to achieve alone, could be mediated by migratory movements of birds. Long-distance dispersal operates over spatial areas that span thousands of kilometers, which allow it to promote rapid range shifts and determine species distributions. \n\nIn seed dispersal, ingestion of seeds that are capable of resisting digestive juices allows the seeds to be scattered in feces and dispersed far from the parent organism. For these seeds, gut passage enhances germination ability when the seeds are ingested by birds and mammals.\n\nFinally, ingestion of herbivores by carnivorous animals may help disperse seeds by preying on primary seed dispersers such as herbivores or omnivores . When a bird is eaten by a cat or another carnivore, that animal will inadvertently consume the seeds that the prey species consumed. These seeds may then be later deposited in a process called diplochory, where a seed is moved by more than one dispersal vector, which is important for seed dispersal outcomes as carnivores range widely and enhance the genetic connectivity of dispersed populations.\n\nBirds act as dispersal vectors for non-seed dispersal units as well. Hummingbirds spread pollen on their beaks, and fungal spores may stick to the bottom of birds’ feet. Water birds may also help to disperse aquatic invertebrates, specifically branchiopods, ostracods, and bryozoans. \n\n\"Main article:\" Myrmecochory\n\nThis includes all of the dispersal caused by ants, including seed dispersal and the dispersal of leaf matter from trees. \n\nSimilarly to birds, dispersal by mammals allows for long distance dispersal, especially via carnivores. The act of carnivores eating primary dispersal vectors (herbivores) can lead to long distance dispersal and connection between different populations of the same species because of large predator ranges in comparison to smaller herbivore ranges. Mammals have been shown to act as dispersal vectors for seeds, spores, and parasites.\n\nJust as in ornithocory, ingestion by herbivores acts as a dispersal vector for seeds, and gut passage increases the rate of germination .\nMarsupials, primates, rodents, bats, and some species in the suborder Feliformia (Cape grey mongooses and Cape genets) have all been identified as pollinators. Non-flying mammals have been identified as acting as pollinators in Australia, Africa, South and Central America. Some plants may have traits that coevolved to utilize mammals as dispersal vectors, such as being extremely pungent in odor, nocturnal nectar production, and robust flowers that can handle rough feeders . The pollen of some plants can be found stuck to the fur of mammals as well as accidentally ingested when nectar is consumed. \nMammals contribute to bryophyte and fern spore dispersal by carrying spores on their fur. Small mammals acting as dispersal vectors may have advantages for the dispersing organism compared to wind transport, as the mammals share similar ecosystems to the parent plant, while wind transport is random. Additionally, mammals can transport spores that have qualities such as low production and non-wind adapted morphology that wouldn't be conducive for wind transport.\n\nDik-dik, (\"Madoqua kirkii\"), Grant's gazelle (\"Gazella granti\"), and impala (\"Aepyceros melampus\") become infected by gastrointestinal nematode parasites that lay on vegetation the antelope consume. Once infected, they disperse nematode parasites in their feces . Once consumed, the eggs are spread to a new area via the defecation of small mounds of dung. \n\nFrogs and lizards have been found to be dispersal vectors for crustaceans and ring worms, specifically bromeliad ostracods (\"Elpidium bromeliarum)\" and annelids (\"Dero superterrenus\"). Annelids showed a strong chemical orientation towards moist frog skin that may have developed to diminish risk of dehydration during transport in the environment. The ostracods have frequently been found to be attached to frogs in order to colonize new areas. Both ostracods and annelids will attach themselves to lizards as well, but they prefer to attach themselves to frogs.\n\n\"Main article:\" Pollination and Pollinators\n\nOne of the most important examples of dispersal via invertebrates are pollinators such as bees, flies, wasps, beetles, and butterflies.\n\nInvertebrates may also act as dispersal vectors for the spores of ferns and bryophytes via endozoochory, or the ingestion of the plant.\n\nAnemochory is dispersal of units by wind. Wind is a major vector of long distance dispersal that is responsible for the spread and propagation of species to new habitats. Each species has its own \"wind dispersal potential\", which is the proportion of dispersal units that travel farther than a predefined reference distance travelled under normal weather conditions. The effectiveness of wind dispersal relies predominantly on the morphological traits and adaptations of the dispersal units and wind conditions. The two main traits of plants that predict their wind dispersal potential are falling velocity and initial release height of the dispersal unit. Higher falling velocity is generally correlated with heavier seeds, which have a lower wind dispersal potential because it takes a stronger wind to carry them. The taller the initial release height of the dispersal unit, the larger the wind dispersal potential because there is a larger window in which it can be picked up by the wind.\n\nMany species have evolved morphological adaptations to maximize wind dispersal potential. Common examples include plumed, winged, and balloon-like diaspores.\n\nPlumed diaspores have thin hair-like projections that allow easier wind uplift. One of the most common plumed species is the dandelion, \"Taraxacum officinale\". The wind dispersal potential of plumed species are directly correlated to the total mass and total surface area of the projected plume.\n\nWinged diaspores have fibrous tissue that develops on the wall of the seed and projects outward . Seed wings are generally thought to co-evolve with the evolution of larger seeds, in order to increase dispersal and offset the weight of the larger seeds. Some common examples include pine and spruce trees.\n\nBalloon-like seeds are a phenomenon where the calyx, a kind of protective pouch or covering the plant uses to guard the seeds, is light and swollen. This ballon-like structure allows the entire pouch of seeds to be dispersed by gusts of wind. A common example of the balloon-like diaspore is the \"Trifolium fragiferum,\" or strawberry clover.\n\nWind dispersal of a particular species can also be affected by human actions. Humans can affect anemochory in three major ways: habitat fragmentation, chemical runoff, and climate change. \n\nClearing land for development and building roads through forests can lead to habitat fragmentation. Habitat fragmentation reduces the number and size of the effected populations, which reduces the amount of seeds that are dispersed.This lowers the probability that dispersed seeds with germinate and take root.\n\nChemical runoff from fertilizer, leakages of sewage, and carbon emissions from fossil fuels can also lead to eutrophication, a build up of nutrients that often leads to excess algae and non-native plant growth. Eutrophication can lead to decreased long distance dispersal because the lack of nutrients to native plants causes a decrease in seed release height. However, because of the lowered release height, eutrophication can sometimes lead to an increase in short distance dispersal.\n\nClimate change effects on wind patterns have the potential increase average wind velocity. However, it can also lead to lower levels of wind dispersal for each individual plant or organism because of the effects climate change has on the normal conditions needed for plant growth, such as temperature and rainfall.\n\nHydrochory is dispersal using water, including oceans, rivers, streams, and rain. It affects many different dispersal units, such as seeds, fern spores, zooplankton, and plankton. \n\nTerrestrial water sources tend to be more restricted in their ability to disperse units. Barriers such as mountain ranges, farm land, and urban centers prevent the relatively free movement of dispersal units seen in open bodies of water. Oceanic dispersal can move individuals or reproductive propagules anywhere from a meter to hundreds of kilometers from the original point depending on the size of the individual . \n\n\"Related Article:\" Ocean dispersal.\n\nA majority of marine organisms utilize ocean currents and movement within the water column to reproduce. The process of releasing reproductive propagules into the water is called broadcast spawning . While broadcast spawning requires parents to be relatively close to each other for fertilization, the fertilized zygotes can be moved extreme distances. A number of marine invertebrates require ocean currents to connect their gametes once broadcast spawning has occurred . Kelp, an important group of sea plants, primarily utilize ocean currents to distribute their spores and larvae. Many coral species reproduce by releasing gametes into the water column with hopes that other local corals will also release gametes before these units are dispersed by ocean currents.\n\nSome non-submerged aquatic plant species, like palm trees and mangroves, have developed fruits that float in sea water in order to utilize ocean currents as a form of dispersal. Coconuts have been found to travel up to thousands of miles away from their parent tree due to their buoyant nature. A variety of over 100 species of vascular plants utilize this dispersal method for their fruit. \n\nMany plants have evolved with specific adaptations to maximize the distance that seeds, fruits, or propagules are dispersed in the ocean. For an increased protection against sinking in the water column, seeds have developed hair or slime on their outer seed coats. Seeds with filled with air, cork, or oil are better prepared to float for farther distances. \n\nAnother aspect of dispersal comes from wave and tidal action. Organisms in shallower waters, such as seagrasses, become displaced and dispersed by waves crashing upon them and tides pulling them out into the open ocean. \n\nSome smaller marine organisms maximize their own dispersal by attaching to a raft - a biotic or abiotic object that is being moved by the ocean’s currents. Biotic rafts can be floating seeds or fruits, leaves, or other propagules. Abiotic rafts are usually floating woods or plastics, including buoys and discarded trash. \n\nSea ice is also an important dispersal vector. Some arctic species rely on sea ice to disperse their eggs, like \"Daphnia pulex\"\".\" Drifting, as discussed above, can be an effective dispersal vector for marine mammals. It has been shown that intertidal benthic invertebrates will utilize sea ice as a raft to travel up to multiple kilometers. \n\nFreshwater dispersal primarily occurs through flowing water transporting dispersal units. Permanent aquatic environments require outside forms of dispersal to retain biodiversity, so hydrochory via freshwater is vital for the success of terrestrial water sources. Lakes remain genetically diverse thanks to rivers that connect lakes to new sources of biodiversity. In lakes that lack connecting rivers, some organisms have developed adaptations that utilize the wind, while in an aquatic environment, to disperse reproductive units. In these cases, the dispersal units are moved to new aquatic habitats by utilizing the wind instead of the water in their habitat. \n\nRunning water is the only form of long distance dispersal present in freshwater sources, so rivers act as the main aquatic terrestrial dispersal vector. Like in marine ecosystems, organisms take advantage of flowing water via passive transport of drifting along on a raft. The distance traveled by floating or drifting organisms and propagules is determined primarily on the amount of time that organism or unit is able to retain buoyancy.  \n\nFreshwater is important for dispersal of non-aquatic terrestrial organisms as well. Bryophytes require an external source of water in order to sexually reproduce. Some bryophytes also utilize falling rain drops to maximize their spore dispersal distances. \n\nExtreme weather events (tropical cyclones, floods and heavy rains, hurricanes, and thunderstorms) are the most intense examples of water functioning as a vector. The high intensity and high volume of rain that comes with these events facilitate long distance dispersal. \n\nOverflow is traditionally a side effect of heavy rains impacting one specific area. Overflows have been shown to be effective in transmitting biodiversity between temporary lakes and ponds. The overflow of pool water acts as an important passive form of hydrochory in which water acts as a vector. Floods displace plants and organisms, whether or not overflow occurs. Macrophytes and organisms as small as zooplankton can be transported via flood pulses.\n\nHurricanes can also act as dispersal vectors. After the 2004 Hurricane Charley struck Florida, there was a higher reported dispersal of the propagules of red mangrove trees. If a hurricane strikes in the later summer months, there is an expected increase in the dispersal of propagules, while early storms can wash out immature propagules and decrease the dispersal of mature propagules for that season.\n\nWhen extreme weather events occur over an open body of water, they can create intense waves.  These waves can create large dispersal within the water column by changing local water movement, but tend to constrict the actual dispersal distance for smaller organisms. \n\nThe fishing industry has introduced new forms in which water acts as a dispersal vector. The water in bait buckets transfers bait everywhere a fisherman takes it, and this can introduce non-native species into areas should this bait water be spilt. This idea is applied on a much larger scale to the ballast tanks of ships. A study done by James Carlton of Williams College reports that more than 3000 species are moving across the ocean in ballast tanks on any given day. \n\nArtificial waterways created by humans have also spurred new forms of hydrochory. Amphipods were found to be able to cross previously uncrossable areas to enter into new drainage pipe thanks to the construction of a canal.\n\nArtificial waterways not only connect communities that are geographically close, but they also allow for the transmission of invasive species from distant communities. The distribution of invasive species is, in part, regulated by local ocean conditions and currents. \n\nThe introduction of human-generated waste, like wood planks and plastic bags, into water sources has increased the amount of viable rafts for dispersal. \n\nHumans have been acting as dispersal vectors since we began moving around the planet, bringing non-native plants and animals with us. As trends in urbanization have increased, urban environments can act as staging grounds for species dispersal and invasion. Many non-native species exist in urban environments and the high rate of movement in an out of urban areas leads to a high level of dispersal to neighboring environments. \n\n"}

As such, it forms a subset of cryptogenic stroke, which is part of the TOAST-classification. The following diagnostic criteria define an ESUS:\n\n\nThe following factors are suggested as pathogenesis of ESUS:\n\n\nESUS is a diagnosis of exclusion based on radiological and cardiological examinations. For exclusion of haemorrhagic or lacunar strokes CT or MRI imaging is needed. Both procedures also allow detection of embolic pattern of ischemic lesions. 12-lead ECG and cardiac monitoring for at least 24 h with automated rhythm detection are mandated to exclude atrial fibrillation; echocardiography (TTE and/or TEE) is used to detect other major-risk cardioembolic sources (e.g., intracardiac thrombi, or ejection fraction <30%). For imaging of both the extracranial and intracranial arteries supplying the area of brain ischaemia, examination methods like catheter, MR/CT angiography or cervical duplex plus transcranial Doppler ultrasonography are required. They allow an exclusion of large vessel stenosis (≥ 50%).\n\nCryptogenic stroke is also an ischemic stroke with more than one probable cause or strokes with incomplete diagnostic workup. ESUS has a clearer definition, with an established minimum diagnostic requirements; this is not required in defining a cryptogenic stroke. ESUS is an embolic stroke for which no probable cause can be identified after a standard diagnostic evaluation.\n\nDue to the lack of data, there are no specific treatment guidelines for ESUS. Current guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy for patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke. However, it is widely believed that there is a substantial overlap between ESUS and cardioembolic stroke so there may be a rationale for anticoagulation. This approach is currently tested in clinical trials.\n\nOn average, ESUS accounts for about 1 in 6 ischemic strokes (17% (range 9 – 25%)) according to a systematic literature review of 9 studies. Patients with ESUS tend to be relatively young and experience mild strokes. However, ESUS is associated with high recurrence rates. Of 2045 ESUS patients (identified by 8 studies)\n\n\nThe stroke recurrence rate was 29.0% over 5 years in patients with ESUS, which is similar to patients with cardioembolic stroke (26.8%), but significantly higher than all types of non-cardioembolic stroke. However, mortality was significantly lower in patients with ESUS than cardioembolic stroke.\n\n"}
{"id": "9567516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9567516", "title": "Emil Calmanovici", "text": "Emil Calmanovici\n\nEmil Calmanovici (March 1896 – March 12, 1956) was a Romanian engineer, businessman, and communist militant. Known for the financial support he gave to the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) during the late 1930s and early 1940s, he became a political prisoner of the Communist regime after being implicated in the show trial of his collaborator Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu. Calmanovici died in mysterious circumstances in Aiud prison, while on recovery from a hunger strike.\n\nBorn to a Jewish family in Piatra Neamţ, he was the son of Mendel and his wife Ana, who ran a business in the town. A graduate of the University of Munich and the University of Berlin, where he was confronted with the establishment of the Nazi regime and became an avid reader of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, he also amassed a fortune in his youth, owing to his real estate investments. Calmanovici decided to dedicate his wealth to the PCR cause, at a time when the party was outlawed.\n\nBy the end of World War II, when they were nationalized, his properties included two construction enterprises, additional shares in a logging company centered in his native town, seven apartments, and over 18,000 m² in Bucharest real estate.\n\nAccording to Calmanovici's statements, he had contributed massive sums to various PCR enterprises between 1937 (the year when he joined the group) and 1944, being responsible for the purchase of a printing press, the renovation of the Central Committee seat in Bucharest, a clandestine radio station, and a kindergarten for children of party members. He estimated that his investments totaled 30 million lei in 1942 currency, which he argued was over 75% of his total income. Calmanovici took pride in noting that this contribution was by far the highest of all those recorded (including that of Jacques Berman). In addition, he contended, nationalization of his wealth had brought the state over 1 billion lei in 1947 currency.\n\nInside the PCR, he kept only sporadic contacts with the \"prison faction\", a group led by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej (according to one account, during the time when Gheorghiu-Dej was held in Doftana prison, Calmanovici sent him a jacket as a gift). Instead, he was close to Pătrășcanu's maverick group (later known as the \"Secretariat faction\"), a fact which, in time, contributed to his arrest and imprisonment (both of which were instigated by members of the \"prison faction\").\n\nDuring the war, when Romania joined the Axis Powers and participated in Operation Barbarossa, he was among those charged with establishing contacts between the Communists and other opposition groups. At the time, his relation with the pro-Allied financier Alexandru Ștefănescu helped him gain intimate knowledge of various negotiations between the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ) and the National Liberal Party (PNL) on one side and Ion Antonescu's dictatorial government on the other, as well as of the latter's tentative moves to withdraw Romania from its alliance with Nazi Germany through a compromise with the Western Allies (the 1943 unsuccessful mission of Barbu Ştirbey to Cairo). Calmanovici forwarded his information to the PCR's Remus Koffler, which helped the group approach and influence the PNȚ leader Iuliu Maniu to form an alliance against Antonescu (one which enlisted support from the Soviet Union).\n\nAfter the fall of Antonescu's regime and the onset of Soviet occupation in August 1944, when the PCR first entered government, Calmanovici became an esteemed party member and officially endorsed industrialist. In the spring of 1945, his Bucharest house served as a meeting place for PCR and pro-Communist forces who planned and succeeded in toppling Prime Minister Nicolae Rădescu (after a series of street clashes, Rădescu was replaced with the Ploughmen's Front leader Petru Groza, whose cabinet was controlled by the PCR). Following this, he was appointed a technical director of the Bucharest Constructions Institute and was involved in enforcing Soviet standards and expertise.\n\nRelations between Calmanovici and the PCR degenerated abruptly toward the end of the 1940s, and he was arrested by the Securitate on May 26, 1951. Several days earlier, Calmanovici had met with Constantin Pîrvulescu. At this meeting, Calmanovici asked Pîrvulescu to use his status as head of the Party Control Commission to grant him a decoration (Calmanovici was stiffly refused, on the grounds that such self-promotion was unprecedented).\n\nDocuments involving the 1943–1944 contacts between Calmanovici, Pătrășcanu, Koffler, and Maniu (who was already imprisoned on such charges following the Tămădău Affair) were interpreted as evidence that the former two had been spying for the Western Allies. In full, the accusation read: \"as an agent of the English espionage services he forwarded information about the PCR, taking part in the criminal action to destroy the party and support the anti-Soviet war\".\n\nCalmanovici stated that, early on, authorities had presented him with the claim that he was kept in custody in order to aid in the process of compiling a history of the PCR. Starting in summer 1951, he was subject to a series of Securitate interrogations, which concluded that he had not contributed to hostile activities and that he was able to support his case with \"sufficient guarantees\".\n\nIn December, Calmanovici, who had devoted his spare time to learning Russian, was supposed to be released from custody. Instead, his case was reviewed by a new group of Securitate officials, who obeyed Gheorghiu-Dej and alleged that the latter's rival, Minister of the Interior Teohari Georgescu, was not enforcing party doctrine (Georgescu was to be himself ousted in 1952). On orders from Alexandru Drăghici and Vladimir Mazuru, under the supervision of several Soviet envoys, Securitate cadres were to induce Calmanovici to confess having spied in Romania during and after the World War. The officer who had originally argued in favor of his release was criticized for having displayed \"lack of vigilance\", and ordered to resume interrogation.\n\nIn several appeals to the PCR leadership (Gheorghiu-Dej, Pîrvulescu, Chivu Stoica, Emil Bodnăraş and others) Calmanovici repeatedly stated his innocence and dismissed accusations that he was a bourgeois figure with insufficient political education. In another personal letter, he compared allegations of espionage with those made by Alexander Kerensky about Vladimir Lenin prior to the October Revolution in Russia.\n\nIn February 1953, Calmanovici gave in to Securitate violence and presented operatives with a fabricated account, stating that he had been part of a network of spies presided over by Milton (a name he came up with after recalling the 17th-century poet John Milton). His inquisitors soon rejected the story, and argued that it was additional proof of \"provocation\" on Calmanovici's part.\n\nEventually, he agreed to sign his name to a confession drawn up by the PCR, in return for a promise that he was to be given at most a four-year sentence. It has been argued that the document endorsed by Calmanovici was directly inspired from the similar one handed over by Nikolai Bukharin during the 1938 Moscow Trial of the Twenty One. In its final form, it also incriminated Calmanovici of Zionism and spying in favor of the Western Allies (the United States, or, alternatively, the United Kingdom).\n\nConsequently, Calmanovici was indicted in Pătrășcanu's 1954 trial, where, despite early promises, the court ultimately sentenced him to life imprisonment and forced labor. The sentence was given on counts of crime against peace and high treason. As Pătrășcanu and Koffler were being swiftly executed in Jilava, he and the other persons sentenced (including Alexandru Ștefănescu, Petre Pandrea, Harry Brauner, Lena Constante, and Pătrășcanu's wife Elena) were dispatched to the infamous Aiud prison, on their way to various facilities.\n\nCalmanovici, who was kept in almost complete isolation, managed to contact other inmates, an infraction which was added to his criminal record.\n\nAs a consequence, the Securitate decided to stage a set of circumstances which were to incriminate him further: in 1955, Calmanovici was escorted out of Aiud and into a villa in Săftica, where he received a humane treatment while being interrogated by Vasile Posteucă. A guard was instructed to approach him and earn his confidence, to the point where Calmanovici trusted him with carrying out a message he had written on linens; addressed to his former employees and meant to be forwarded to Jewish communists in the Western world, these exposed the fallacies and major irregularities of his trial. (In similar appeals, Calmanovici had also meant to bring his case to the attention of the Cominform.) After the guard handed the letters over to his superiors, Calmanovici was chained and moved back into Aiud.\n\nHe decided to publicize his innocence by beginning a hunger strike, which eventually led physicians on duty to force-feed him. His diet at the time went against medical guidelines for people with malnutrition, and was the most likely cause of his death by gastrointestinal perforation — two prison staff members later attested that this was done on purpose, as a method of assassination. It has also been noted that Calmanovici's signed statement according to which he was abandoning the hunger strike and was accepting the treatment, extracted only hours before his death, was immediately communicated to higher authority (unlike any other such statement of the time).\n\nOf his group, Calmanovici was the only one to die in custody (all others were released ca. 1964, when they benefited from an amnesty).\n\nLike all defendants in the Pătrășcanu trial, Calmanovici was rehabilitated in April 1968 by Nicolae Ceauşescu, following a change in policy which was meant to discredit his deceased predecessor Gheorghiu-Dej and the former Securitate chief Alexandru Drăghici.\n\nThe new inquiry, overseen by Ion Popescu-Puţuri, found that Calmanovici had been the victim of systematic abuse. Among others, it was established that Calmanovici's arrest had been operated on the basis of Gheorghiu-Dej's personal views, that the charges had for long not been communicated to Calmanovici, that Soviet agents had openly intervened in interrogations, and that, like virtually all other defendants, he had been repeatedly beaten and otherwise tortured to ensure a forced confession.\n\nCalmanovici's son became a resident and later a citizen of Sweden, becoming known under the name Gad Calmgran. He worked as a journalist, and was a collaborator for the newspaper \"Dagens Nyheter\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1194555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1194555", "title": "Exotheology", "text": "Exotheology\n\nThe term \"exotheology\" was coined in the 1960s or early 1970s for the examination of theological issues as they pertain to extraterrestrial intelligence. It is primarily concerned with either conjecture about possible theological beliefs that extraterrestrials might have, or how our own theologies have been or will be influenced by evidence of and/or interaction with extraterrestrials.\n\nOne of the main themes of exotheology is applying the concept of extraterrestrials who are sentient, and more to the point, endowed with a soul, as a thought experiment to the examination of a given theology, mostly Christian theology, occasionally also Jewish theology.\n\nA Christian writer early to address the question was C. S. Lewis (1898–1963) who in a 1950s article in the \"Christian Herald\" contemplated the possibility of the Son of God incarnating in other, extraterrestrial, worlds, or else that God could devise an entirely distinct plan of salvation for extraterrestrial communities from the one applicable to humans.\nLutheran theologian Ted Peters (2003) asserts that the questions raised by the possibility of extraterrestrial life are by no means new to Christian theology and by no means pose, as asserted by other authors, a threat for Christian dogma. Peters points out that medieval theology had frequently considered the question of \"what if God had created many worlds?\", as early as the discussion of the Antipodes by the Church Fathers.\n\nThe Catholic Vatican theologian Corrado Balducci often discussed the question in Italian popular media, and in 2001 published a statement \"UFOs and Extraterrestrials - A Problem for the Church?\".\nIn a 2008 statement, José Gabriel Funes, head of the Vatican Observatory, said\n\"Just as there is a multiplicity of creatures on earth, there can be other beings, even intelligent, created by God. This is not in contrast with our faith because we can't put limits on God's creative freedom\".\n\nSmaller denominations also have similar treatments in passing in their key writings: Christian Science and the Course in Miracles treat extraterrestrials as effectively brother spiritual beings in a non-absolute physical experience, the founder of the former writing, \"The universe of Spirit is peopled with spiritual beings...\", and Emanuel Swedenborg wrote, \"Anyone with a sound intellect can know from many considerations that there are numerous worlds with people on them. Rational thought leads to the conclusion that massive bodies such as the planets, some of which are larger than our own earth, are not empty masses created merely to wander aimlessly around the sun, and shine with their feeble light on one planet. No, they must have a much greater purpose than that. ... What would one planet be to God, who is infinite, and for whom thousands, or even tens of thousands of planets, all full of inhabitants, would be such a trifling matter as to be almost nothing?\"\n\nWhile other Protestant denominations have tended to be somewhat terracentric, much as Roman Catholicism was until more recent times, receptivity to the idea of extraterrestrial civilizations likely depends on the degree of associated biblical literalism. Those of more fundamentalist leanings as interviewed occasionally on UFO- and paranormal-themed radio shows like Coast to Coast AM often try to fit extraterrestrial beings into the mold of demons or Nephilim, lacking much better category in which to place them, whereas schools of less literal persuasion would be more open to alternative perspectives. These would include either fundamental reexamination of traditional assumptions, some reconsideration of extraterrestrials as in some sense angels, or at least wider interpretations possible in the saying ascribed to Jesus of Nazareth, \"And other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\", which while probably quite presumptuous-sounding in the very large cosmic perspective could potentially lend itself to a reading in some more impersonal sense as well better befitting the larger magnitude of exotheology.\n\nRabbi Aryeh Kaplan, who was also a physicist, was inclined toward the belief in extraterrestrial life, citing various classic Jewish authorities. Among them are the medieval philosopher Rabbi Chasdai Crescas (Ohr Hashem 4:2) and 18th century kabbalist Rabbi Pinchas Eliyahu Horowitz (Sefer HaBris). After presenting his sources, Rabbi Kaplan remarks, \"We therefore find the basic thesis of the Sefer HaBris supported by a number of clear-cut statements by our Sages. There may even be other forms of intelligent life in the universe, but such life forms do not have free will, and therefore do not have moral responsibility\"—at least in the same sense as human beings.\nRabbi Kaplan also cites Judges 5:23 (\"Cursed is Meroz...\"), about which Rashi, the foremost medieval commentator remarks, \"Some say [Meroz] was a planet, and some say [Meroz] was a prominent person who was near the battle area and yet did not come [to intervene].\" (The basis of Rashi's comment is a Talmudic discussion in tractate Moed Katan 16a. However, the verse in Judges is more commonly understood as a literary usage by Deborah the Prophetess and not an affirmation of possible intelligent life on another planet.)\n\nRabbi Norman Lamm, former chancellor of Yeshiva University, has also written on this subject, asserting that if the existence of extraterrestrial life should be confirmed, religious scholars must revise previous assumptions to the contrary. He, too, does not rule out this possibility from an Orthodox Jewish point of view.\n\nRabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, an eminent 20th century Talmudic authority and rabbinical leader, is cited as having been open-minded about extraterrestrial life. He is said to have remarked that life on other planets would only reflect God's greatness, which exceeds mortal understanding, while not contradicting the role of the Jewish people to heed the Torah and in so doing to perform God's will here on earth.\n\nDepending on the suras cited, the Quran of Islam appears to leave open the door to the idea of extraterrestrials, as in 27:65, situated similarly on a par with humans subject to a divine judgment leading toward a heaven or hell as reward or punishment for the deeds of one's life.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31830157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31830157", "title": "Finn the Human", "text": "Finn the Human\n\nFinn Mertens (also known as Finn and Finn the Human) is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the American animated television series \"Adventure Time\" created by Pendleton Ward. He is voiced by Jeremy Shada in most appearances. The character made his debut in the original pilot, where he was named Pen and voiced by Zack Shada, Jeremy's older brother.\n\nThe character has been met with largely positive critical reception.\n\nFinn debuted at age 12 but aged over the course of the show, and was 17 by the series finale. Finn sets off on magical random quests around the Land of Ooo. He would gladly fight or beat up anything evil, but would not harm anything good or \"neutral\" as shown in \"The Enchiridion!\" when he refused to squash an innocent ant. Having a strong moral code, Finn swore that he would help anyone in need and often performs heroic feats to save the day; however, Finn's enthusiastic nature becomes more toned down as the series progresses, suggesting he is both maturing and developing as a character as he ages. As shown in \"Memories of Boom Boom Mountain\", Finn appears to have been abandoned in the woods during infancy. He reveals that he had made \"boom boom\"—a euphemism for defecation—on a large leaf, fallen on it, and lay there crying until Joshua and Margaret, Jake's parents, rescued him from the wilderness and took him in to raise him alongside Jake, who became like a brother to him. As such, Jake is also Finn's adoptive brother. In \"Henchman\", when Finn is asked about his parents, he says Jake told him that he came from a cabbage, in jest. In the episode \"Susan Strong\", Finn states that he knows nothing of his human parents or any other humans. He is one of the few characters in the series (along with Flame Princess) who ages regularly. According to the episode \"The Vault\", Finn has had a number of past lives. In \"Red Starved\" it is revealed that Finn is color blind, believing that an emerald was a ruby.\n\nIn the Season 6 opener \"Escape From the Citadel\", Finn has lost half of his right arm, up to his elbow, from which a flower protruded. He later regains his arm, now as a prosthetic, in the episode \"Breezy\", only to lose it once more in the episode \"Reboot\" when his grass arm transforms itself into a humanoid, sentient being. In the following episode \"Two Swords\", Finn gets fitted with a new robotic arm by Princess Bubblegum, to replace the missing arm. In the Season 9 finale \"Three Buckets\" it is revealed that this arm can transform into many different weapons.\nIn the series final episode, \"Come Along With Me\", Finn loses his robotic arm while entering GOLB's mouth, the entity biting it off and making it fall to the ground. 1000 years on the future, a pair called Shermy and Beth finds that robotic arm after it fell from a Prize Ball Guardian's feet.\n\nFinn is currently 17 years old as revealed in the season 10 episode \"Seventeen\". At the beginning of the series, Finn was a 12-year-old boy who is supposedly the only known human in the Land of Ooo. During the episode \"Mystery Train\", Finn turned 13; it has been stated that the episode first airing date (March 14) is Finn's birthday. After season 3 ended, Pendleton Ward stated in an interview that Finn was 14. Finn was 15 years old in the second half of Season 5, according to Adam Muto. In the Season 6 finale, \"The Comet\", Finn reveals that he has reached 16 years of age. And finally, during the episode \"Seventeen\", Finn turned 17 years old. This means that unlike in many other cartoons where characters stay the same age or age through time skips, in \"Adventure Time\", time passes mostly regularly (from Seasons 1 to around 5). However, at some point, the rate time passed in the show became slower and it stopped being in real-time, as Finn is only 17 by the ending instead of 20.\n\nUntil the episode \"Betty\", Finn was the only known human in the Land of Ooo. A common theory explaining the etymology of his name includes the French word \"fin\", meaning \"end\". Another possibility is that his name is Irish, Finn being a name of a mythological Irish hero, whose name is derived from \"fionn\", the Irish language word for blond; Finn the Human is blond as well.\n\nThe cause for him being the last human is alluded to by Finn and many other characters as \"The Great Mushroom War\", which was a nuclear war that wiped out the majority of humanity. Up until the character \"Susan Strong\" is introduced, Finn believes that he has never met another human. When Finn encounters Susan Strong, the other members of Susan's tribe of \"Hyoomen\" are revealed to be mutants, and Susan's identity as a human or mutant was left ambiguous. In the episode \"Beautopia\", it was hinted upon that Susan may also be human, but was not confirmed at the time. \n\nHowever, in the Season Six episode, \"Dark Purple\", Susan's hat was taken off, revealing that she is indeed human, but with a cybernetic implant on the left side of her head, which meant she was a cyborg. The businessmen that Finn meets in the \"Business Time\" episode were once human, though they had mutated over time. In the episode \"Her Parents\", Lady Rainicorn's parents (Bob and Ethel) attempt to eat Finn because they thought they would never get the chance to eat one, as they believed humans were extinct. Finn's female counterpart Fionna the Human is a human living in the Land of Aaa, though it has no official name; however, she does not actually exist. Fiona exists only in a fictuitous parallel universe conceived by the Ice King, when he wrote a fan fiction based upon his life and experiences with Finn and Jake. There are many other characters in the show that appear to be human but have been confirmed to be humanoids or mutants. In the episode \"Be More\", the character Moseph \"Moe\" Mastro Giovanni, who is the creator of BMO, was once a human, but to ensure his immortality, he has replaced most of his body parts (except the skin) with artificial ones, which makes him virtually a cyborg. In the episode \"Betty,\" Betty Grof (known as Simon Petrikov's former fiancee) was brought from the past into Ooo, and later in \"Escape From the Citadel\" Finn's father, Martin, is introduced, making Finn no longer the last human.\n\nHowever, during the Season Six finale event, two episodes and their events bring a return to Finn's status as the last human on Ooo. In \"You Forgot Your Floaties\", Betty Grof becomes Magic Man's apprentice and in return for helping Magic Man, he promised her a cure for her fiance. Things go awry and at the end of the episode, where Betty takes Magic Man's hat, thus becoming a wizard and losing her status as a human. Additionally, in the season finale episode, \"The Comet\", after Finn learns of his past and declines an offer to become a higher being, his father, Martin, takes the offer and ascends to another level of being, likely bringing an end to his human form. In the episode, \"Preboot\", it is revealed there are other humans outside of Ooo, and at the end of \"Reboot\", Finn destroys Susan's cybernetic implant, making her fully human in the process.\n\nDuring the miniseries \"Islands\", Finn's status as the last human is completely dispelled. It is revealed that centuries after the Great Mushroom War, a group of surviving humans left Ooo and moved to a chain of islands. After many generations, there are still humans living there. Finn's mother, named Minerva, lives on one of the islands known as Founders' Island, and was a medic in service to her society, until she uploaded her mind to a network of robots after the island was ravaged by an illness. In addition to meeting his biological mother, Finn meets an entire population of humans. Although Finn requests that the humans of the archipelago may venture out of the islands and back to Ooo, they refuse to emigrate. However, in the episode \"Come Along With Me\", the humans return to the land of Ooo in several ships, bringing Minerva with them on a computer screen.\n\nFinn is a 5-foot tall teenage human. He has blond hair, of which the length differs due to occasional haircuts. His eyes and eyebrows appear black from a distance, but according to lead character designer Andy Ristaino, they are blue. Although, originally dots, his eyes are ovals by Season 7. He wears a white bear hat, short blue pants, and a light blue T-shirt. He also has a green backpack, black shoes, and socks rolled down to his ankles. Finn has peach color skin.\nFinn is a teenage boy who is average height and weight. His arms and legs are very thin, but he has a wide torso. He is missing several teeth because they often face monsters that hit him in the face, also he often bites rocks and other hard objects. These teeth are sometimes round or pointed and constantly changing place, depending on the occasion. In the episode \"The Enchiridion!\" it can be seen for a moment that his left eye is green while his right eye is blue as if he has heterochromia. However, Andy Ristaino confirmed that this was a \"special occasion\" and that in fact, both eyes are light blue, which is not visible to the naked eye. He also points out in that episode that Finn had a small round nose but this is considered more of an error or humorous scene.\n\nIn \"Escape from the Citadel\", Finn had lost a right arm after it was pulled off after an attempt to reach his father, which was then coated by the blood of a Citadel Guardian that made it grow into a small flower. He later got his arm back in the episode, \"Breezy,\" where the flower stub matured into a tree and broke away like a cocoon, revealing a new limb. In the seventh season finale, \"Reboot\", Finn lost it once more when his grass arm tries to attack a savage Susan and transforms into a sentient grass being called Fern the Human. Starting with the eighth season premiere, \"Two Swords\", Finn has been fitted with a new robotic arm by Princess Bubblegum, who fastened it in his amputated part since his old arm was no longer part of his body.\n\nAccording to Jake, Finn is about tall. This is revealed in the episode \"Dungeon Train\", in the second half of the fifth season. In the 23rd episode of the sixth season, The Pajama War, it is seen that he has grown considerably, being almost as tall as Princess Bubblegum, who, biologically, is many years older than Finn. In \"Elements, Part Five: Slime Central\" Finn states that his shoe size is size 10.\n\nFinn typically wears a Munsell blue T-shirt, short blue pants, a two-toned lime green circular backpack, rolled-down white socks, and a pair of black shoes. Finn's most prominent attire is a white hat with two \"ears\" sticking out on top that covers his entire head minus his face. The hat is inspired by a character called Bueno, a bear from a Pendleton Ward comics. Finn can occasionally be seen in variations of his standard outfit. In \"Ocean of Fear,\" his footwear appears to be black booties with white cuffs. In \"It Came from the Nightosphere\", Finn has a small pocket sewn onto his shirt that he carries Jake in. This appears again in \"Davey\" where he uses it to hide Jake while Finn steals the keys from the guards as he breaks the former out of jail. During \"In Your Footsteps,\" the Bear wears Finn's clothes, which suggests that Finn has multiple sets of the same outfit, including his hat. However, in \"Little Dude,\" when Finn's hat comes to life and is set free, Jake tells Finn that they should go skin an evil bear, which implies that Finn only had one hat.\n\nAside from his normal outfit, Finn can be seen wearing a cream-yellow sweater in colder areas such as the Ice Kingdom but currently wears his pink sweater made by Princess Bubblegum. In \"Holly Jolly Secrets Part II,\" he wears a dark blue sweater with Christmas decorations on it and a green scarf. Finn also wears white briefs that make their first appearance in \"City of Thieves\". In \"Who Would Win,\" he was shown to wear a different pair with red elastic. Finn sleeps in red footed pajamas that appear in many episodes, but in the animated short, he sleeps in a red sleeping bag in his regular clothes. In the series, the sleeping bag is beige.\n"}

One reload torpedo was carried for each tube, for a total of twelve. They were also armed with one deck gun for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of machine guns.\n\n\"Dessiè\" was built at the Tosi shipyard in Taranto. She was laid down on 20 April 1936, launched on 22 November of the same year, and commissioned on 14 April 1937. Upon commission, she was assigned to 43rd Submarine Squadron in Taranto. During August and September of 1937 she performed several missions during the Spanish Civil War but without any success . In 1938 she was reassigned to Tobruk, and in 1940 she returned to Italy, and was assigned to 46th Squadron (IV Submarine Group) based first at Taranto and then at Augusta.\n\nAt the beginning of the World War II from 8 to 16 August 1940, \"Dessiè\", under command of captain Fausto Sestini, patrolled the waters between Gaudo and Cerigotto, just off the coast of Crete. In the evening of August 13 she sighted a fast transport moving east. An attack was attempted but was unsuccessful because of the speed of the target.\n\nBetween late October and early November \"Dessiè\" was part of a group of four submarines sent to patrol an area between the Ionian Sea and the Aegean Sea, but no sightings were made, even though the British Fleet was in that area at the time .\n\nAt the end of the month she was again deployed, now under command of captain Adriano Pini, this time off Malta with the task of intercepting the ships of British Operation \"Collar\". At 3:05 on November 28, she sighted a naval column consisting of three capital ships. \"Dessiè\" launched two stern torpedoes from 3,500 meters against a middle target, and disengaged by diving. An explosion was heard, but British official documents mention no attack by \"Dessié\" or any damage inflicted . The Royal Navy's 3rd Cruise Division, consisting of heavy cruiser and light cruisers and was indeed passing through the area at the time of the attack.\n\nBetween December 16-25, 1940 \"Dessiè\" together with submarines and patrolled around Malta. In January 1941 she was deployed off Derna. Both patrols were uneventful.\n\nOn May 20, 1941 \"Dessiè\" together with numerous other submarines was deployed to an area between Crete, Alexandria and Sollum, to support the German invasion of Crete (Operation Merkur).\n\nOn July 21 and 22, 1941, \"Dessiè\" along with three other submarines was deployed to area between Pantelleria and Malta. Her task was to intercept a British convoy, part of the Operation \"Substance\", but she did not sight any enemy ships .\n\nOn January 3, 1942 \"Dessiè\" was sent to patrol an area south off Malta with the task of detecting and attacking any British naval forces that would attempt to intercept an Italian convoy \"M 43\" bringing supplies to Libya. No ships were detected.\n\nIn mid-June 1942 she was sent along with four other submarines, including and to patrol between Malta, Pantelleria and Lampedusa with a task of intercepting a British convoy, part of Operation \"Harpoon\", however, the submarine did not sight any enemy ships.\n\nOn August 11, 1942 \"Dessiè\", now under command of captain Renato Scandola, was among eleven submarines deployed off the coast Tunisia, between Scoglio Due Fratelli and Skerki Banks. Her task was to intercept a British convoy for Malta, part of Operation \"Pedestal\". Around 19:00 on August 12 \"Dessiè\" sighted the convoy, counting 14 merchants and ten destroyers. At 19:10 she closed in to within 1,800 meters and at 19:38 she launched four torpedoes. After one minute and forty seconds a loud explosion was heard, as SS \"Brisbane Star\" (12,791 GRT) was hit. However, the steamship succeeded in restarting her engines and reaching Malta on August 14 after a short stop in Soussa, even though she was further damaged by German torpedo bombers . At 19:56 \"Dessiè\", while preparing to launch her stern torpedoes, was attacked by enemy destroyers, who continued their attacks until 21:27, without causing any damage to the submarine. \"Dessiè\" surfaced at 22:12 and continued her patrol. In the evening of August 13 she was bombed by an aircraft, that killed one crew member and wounded several others and caused damage to her batteries which forced her to return to the base.\n\nOn November 2, 1942 \"Dessiè\" left Messina at 21:15 carrying 20 tons of ammunition to Tobruk. She arrived in Tobruk around 5 or 6 November 1942\nunloaded her cargo and departed at 16:10 to return to Messina where she arrived on November 11, 1942.\n\nOn November 18, 1942 \"Dessiè\" sailed from Messina, under command of captain Alberto Gorini, to patrol an area off the coast of Bona and to attack enemy traffic around the ports of Philippeville and Bougie. At 19:12 on November 27, 1942 captain Gorini communicated with the base for the last time. Only after the end of World War II it was learned that \"Dessiè\" was detected on the surface by airplanes at 14:05 on November 28, 1942 about 10 miles off Bona. A pilot radioed in her coordinates and destroyers and were sent to search for the submarine. Detected and hit hard by depth charges, \"Dessiè\" had to surface with a noticeable stern list, and before any crew could leave the boat, she went down and finally sunk stern first with all hands .\n\n\n"}

Conn could also claim membership of Nelson's \"Band of Brothers\", a clique of dashing naval officers who participated in Nelson's campaigns during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, as well as a close friendship with the admiral himself, who once said: \"A better or more zealous officer than Captain Conn is not in His Majesty's service.\"\n\nBorn to a Royal Navy warrant officer of Irish extraction, also named John Conn, he was baptised at Stoke Damerel, Devon, on 5 August 1764. Conn first went to sea in 1778, aged thirteen, aboard on his father's ship , before securing a place on as a midshipman, and in which he saw action at the battle of the Saintes in April 1782. In 1788 he was made a lieutenant, but had to wait five years before being given a good position, using the intervening time to get married to Margaret Nelson, a vicar's daughter. Serving aboard the flagship at the Glorious First of June, he came to the attention of Admiral Lord Howe. He commissioned the 12-gun gun vessel in June 1797 but left her a year later. He then further distinguished himself in October 1798 in at the battle of Donegal, which resulted in the destruction of a French invasion fleet headed for Ireland. He was promoted to commander on 11 August 1800 and took command of the bomb vessel . At the first battle of Copenhagen his expertise caused terrible damage to the Danish fleet. Next, he participated in Nelson's bold but disastrous attack on the French invasion force in Boulogne shortly afterwards, commanding the division of gun-boats, and gaining his commanding officer's attention and respect.\n\nConn received promotion to post-captain on 29 August 1802 and took command of . His nine-year-old son Henry joined him on \"Culloden\". Conn then transferred to the French prize and joined Nelson in the Mediterranean at Nelson's request. In 1805 Conn was given temporary command of the first rate flagship and his old ship \"Royal Sovereign\" whilst their commanders were on leave; his performance further contributed to his reputation as a reliable and steady officer. On 10 October he returned the \"Royal Sovereign\" to Admiral Collingwood and took command of the fast new second rate .\n\nEleven days later Conn and his crew were thrown into battle as the Franco-Spanish fleet attempted to break out of Cadiz. Situated halfway down Collingwood's division, Conn struggled to reach the action, only getting there around the time Nelson was mortally wounded in the northern division. Making up for the delay, \"Dreadnought\" tangled with the , rescuing the battered , killing the Spanish captain Cosmé Damián Churruca and forcing his ship to surrender. Charging on from this victory, the \"Dreadnought\" engaged the Spanish flagship , mortally wounding the Spanish admiral Gravina, but being unable to defeat the enemy, which succeeded in escaping back to Cadiz. Conn even managed to rescue his prize, the \"San Juan Nepomuceno\" being one of only four captured enemy ships to survive the storm.\n\nFollowing the battle, in which \"Dreadnought\" suffered 33 casualties, Conn continued in service taking over the massive 112 gun and then the 120 gun as flag captain before moving as a commodore to the West Indies in in 1810. Admiral's rank and the honours which came with it were surely not far away when tragedy struck on 4 May when during the chase of a small French ship near Bermuda, Conn became over-eager, slipped and fell overboard. \"Swiftsure\" was halted and a search was conducted, but Conn had drowned before help arrived. His passing was mourned in Britain and especially in the Navy where he was a popular and respected figure. Sir John Borlase Warren, an old commander and friend, expressed regret at the death of \"so deserving an officer as Captain Conn.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "353852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=353852", "title": "Lee Boyd Malvo", "text": "Lee Boyd Malvo\n\nLee Boyd Malvo (born February 18, 1985), also known as John Lee Malvo, is a convicted murderer who, along with John Allen Muhammad, committed murders in connection with the Beltway sniper attacks in the Washington Metropolitan Area over a three-week period in October 2002. Currently, he is serving multiple life sentences at Red Onion State Prison in Virginia, a supermax prison. Muhammad was executed in 2009. Although the two men's actions were classified by the media as psychopathy attributable to serial killer characteristics, researchers have debated whether or not their psychopathy meets this classification or that of spree killing. In 2012, Malvo claimed that he was sexually abused by Muhammad.\n\nThe Beltway sniper attacks turned out to be the last of a series of shootings across the United States connected to these individuals which began on the West Coast. Muhammad had befriended the juvenile Malvo and enlisted him in the attacks. According to Craig Cooley, one of Malvo's defense attorneys, Malvo believed Muhammad when he told him that the $10 million ransom sought from the US government to stop the sniper killings would be used to establish a Utopian society for one hundred and forty homeless black children on a Canadian compound.\n\nMalvo and his mother, Una Sceon James, first met John Allen Muhammad in Antigua and Barbuda around 1999, where James and Muhammad developed a strong friendship. Later, James left Antigua for Fort Myers, Florida, using false documents. She left her son with Muhammad, reportedly planning to have him follow her later. Malvo arrived illegally in Miami in 2001, and in December of that year, he and his mother were apprehended by the Border Patrol in Bellingham, Washington. (Una James was deported to Jamaica on December 15, 2002 in the aftermath of the shootings.) In January 2002, Malvo was released on a $1,500 bond. Malvo traveled to Bellingham, Washington, where he lived in a homeless shelter with Muhammad. Malvo enrolled in Bellingham High School with Muhammad falsely listed as his father, but he did not make any friends, according to his classmates. While in the Tacoma, Washington area, according to his statements to investigators, Malvo shoplifted a Bushmaster XM-15 from Bull's Eye Shooter Supply and practiced his marksmanship on the Bull's Eye firing range adjacent to the gun shop. Under federal laws, neither Muhammad nor Malvo was legally allowed to purchase or possess guns, with both classified as prohibited persons under the Gun Control Act of 1968.\n\nMalvo was initially arrested under federal charges, but they were dropped. He was transferred to Virginia custody and sent to jail in Fairfax County. He was charged by the Commonwealth of Virginia for two capital crimes: the murder of FBI analyst Linda Franklin \"in the commission of an act of terrorism\" (an addendum to Virginia law that was added after the September 11, 2001, attacks) and the murder of more than one person in a three-year period. He was also charged with the unlawful use of a firearm in the murder of Franklin. Initially, a Fairfax attorney, Michael Arif, was appointed to represent him, along with Thomas B. Walsh and Mark J. Petrovich. Later, prominent Richmond attorney Craig Cooley was appointed to the team and assumed a leadership role. While in jail, Malvo made a recorded confession to Detective Samuel Walker in which he stated that he \"intended to kill them all\".\n\nUnder a change of venue, the trial was moved over 150 miles away to the city of Chesapeake, Virginia. Malvo pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to all charges on the grounds that he was under Muhammad's complete control. One of Malvo's psychiatric witnesses testified that Muhammad, a member of Nation of Islam, had indoctrinated Malvo into believing that the proceeds of an extortion attempt would be used to begin a new nation of only pure black young persons somewhere in Canada.\n\nDuring the trial, Cooley said that violent video games had contributed significantly to Malvo's state of mind and his willingness to commit murder. Cooley said, \"He's trained and desensitized with video games, computer games, to train him to shoot human forms over and over.\" Sociologists Lawrence Kutner and Cheryl K. Olson, however, argue in their book \"Grand Theft Childhood\" that other factors were much more significant. \"In court, Lee Malvo admitted that he trained by shooting a real gun at paper plates that represented human heads. Also, Malvo had a long history of antisocial and criminal behavior, including torturing small animals, one of the best predictors of future violent criminal behavior.\"\n\nOn December 18, 2003, after nearly 14 hours of deliberation, a jury convicted Malvo of both charges. On December 23, the jury recommended a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for the murder of Franklin. On March 10, 2004, Malvo was sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n\nOn October 26, 2004, under a plea bargain to avoid a possible death penalty, Malvo entered an Alford plea to the charges of murdering Kenneth Bridges and attempting to murder Caroline Seawell while Malvo was in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. He also pleaded guilty to two firearms charges and agreed not to appeal his conviction for the murder of Franklin. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole for murder, plus eight years imprisonment for the weapons charges.\n\nOne Virginia prosecutor in Prince William County had stated he would wait to decide whether to try Malvo on additional capital charges in his jurisdiction until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on whether juveniles may be subject to the penalty of execution. However, in light of the March 1, 2005 Supreme Court decision in \"Roper v. Simmons\" that the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution for crimes committed when under the age of 18, the prosecutors in Prince William County decided not to pursue the charges against Malvo. However, prosecutors in Maryland, Louisiana and Alabama were still interested in putting both Malvo and Muhammad on trial.\n\nAs Malvo was 17 when he committed the crimes, he cannot face the death penalty, but still may be extradited to Alabama, Louisiana and other states for prosecution. At the outset of the Beltway sniper prosecutions, the primary reason for extraditing the two suspects from Maryland, where they were arrested, to Virginia was the differences in how the two states deal with the death penalty. While the death penalty was allowed in Maryland, it only applied to persons who were adults at the time of their crimes, whereas Virginia had also allowed the death penalty for offenders who had been juveniles when their crimes were committed. A death sentence was more likely to result in execution in Virginia than in Maryland, which abolished its death penalty in 2013. \n\nOn June 16, 2006, Malvo told authorities that he and Muhammad were guilty of four additional shootings. The four most recently linked victims were also shot in 2002: a man killed in Los Angeles during a robbery in February or March; a 76-year-old man who survived a shooting on May 18 at a golf course in Clearwater, Florida; a man shot to death while doing yard work in Denton, Texas, May 27; and 54-year-old John Gaeta, who survived being shot on August 1 during a robbery outside a shopping mall near Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\nOn October 10, 2006, Malvo pleaded guilty to the six murders he was charged with in Maryland. On October 26, he told police that he and Muhammad had killed Jerry Taylor, 60, as Taylor practiced chip shots at a Tucson, Arizona golf course in March 2002. Tucson detectives interviewed Malvo about Taylor, who died from a single gunshot fired at long range, but did not disclose their findings. On November 8, Malvo was sentenced to six consecutive life sentences without possibility of parole.\n\nIn 2003, Malvo and Muhammad were named in a major civil lawsuit by the Legal Action Project of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence on behalf of two of their victims who were seriously wounded and the families of some of those murdered. Co-defendants Bull's Eye Shooter Supply and Bushmaster Firearms contributed to a landmark $2.5 million out-of-court settlement in late 2004.\n\nIn Muhammad's May 2006 trial in Montgomery County, Maryland, Malvo took the stand and confessed to a more detailed version of the pair's plans. Malvo, after extensive counseling, admitted that he had been lying in the statement he made after his arrest when he admitted to being the triggerman for every shooting. Malvo claimed that he had said this in order to protect Muhammad from the death penalty because it was more difficult to achieve the death penalty for a minor. Malvo stated, \"I'm not proud of myself. I'm just trying to make amends\", expressing his regret in the shootings. In his two days of testimony, Malvo outlined detailed aspects of all the shootings.\n\nPart of his testimony concerned Muhammad's complete plan, which consisted of three phases in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metro areas. Phase One consisted of meticulously planning, mapping and practicing their locations around the D.C. area so that after each shooting they could quickly leave the area on a predetermined path and move to the next location. Muhammad's goal in Phase One was to kill six white people a day for 30 days. Malvo went on to describe how Phase One did not go as planned due to heavy traffic and the lack of a clear shot and/or getaway at different locations.\n\nPhase Two was meant to take place in Baltimore. Malvo described how this phase was close to being implemented, but was never carried out. Phase Two was intended to begin by killing a pregnant woman by shooting her in the abdomen. The next step would have been to shoot and kill a Baltimore police officer. At the officer's funeral, they would plant several improvised explosive devices. These explosives were intended to kill a large number of police since many police would attend another officer's funeral. More bombs were then to be detonated as ambulances arrived at the scene.\n\nThe last phase was to take place very shortly after, if not during, Phase Two. The third phase was to extort several million dollars from the U.S. government. This money would be used to finance a larger plan to travel north into Canada and recruit other effectively orphaned boys to use weapons and stealth and send them out to commit shootings across the country.\n\nAs of 2014, Malvo is incarcerated at the Red Onion State Prison as Virginia Department of Corrections Inmate 1180834.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2637732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2637732", "title": "Lefty-righty switch", "text": "Lefty-righty switch\n\nIn baseball, the lefty-righty switch is a maneuver by which a player that struggles against left- or right-handed players is replaced by a player who excels in the situation, usually only for the duration of the situation in question. For instance, a right-handed pitcher who is weak against left-handed hitting and is facing a left-handed hitter would be replaced with a pitcher, usually left-handed, who does a superior job of getting a left-handed hitter out. Similarly, a batter who has difficulty hitting against a left-handed pitcher will sometimes be pinch hit for by a batter who does well, even if the original player is superior in other respects.\n\nConventional baseball wisdom suggests that, when a pitcher and a hitter pitch or bat with the same hand, the pitcher typically has the advantage. This especially holds true for left-handed pitchers, as lefties are less common in a major-league lineup than righties. As a result, the most common use of the lefty-righty switch is when a right-handed pitcher is facing a left-handed batter. The manager of the defensive team will sometimes go to the bullpen, especially in close games where a reliever has already entered the game, and pull out a left-handed specialist to face the left-handed batter. The new pitcher will then attempt to get the batter out. Whether he succeeds or fails, the pitcher will often be replaced after the at-bat.\n\nThe lefty-righty switch can also be used against switch hitters who are noticeably poorer from one side of the plate than the other, or in the somewhat rarer instance of a batter who does poorly against \"opposite\"-handed pitchers. The basic principle in these cases remains the same.\n\nIt is less common, although still frequent, for a batter to be replaced to gain a handedness advantage over a pitcher. For instance, with a left-handed pitcher in and a left-handed batter due up, a right-handed bat may be called in from the bench. The righty may not be as strong an all-round player as the player he replaced (thus, his absence from the everyday lineup), but he is a superior tactical choice for the purpose of getting on base in one at bat with a favorable matchup. Such a batter can be pinch run for if he gets on, replaced with a better defensive player for the next half-inning, or simply left in for the duration of the game.\n\nThe two maneuvers sometimes occur in sequence. For instance, a manager may be faced with the situation of a right-handed reliever facing a strong left-handed bat late in a close game. In such a situation, the manager will often call for his left-handed specialist. However, if the opposing manager has an adequate right-handed bat on his bench, he may pinch hit for the left-handed batter, thus restoring his matchup advantage. The rules of baseball dictate that a pitcher must face at least one batter once he has entered a game, therefore the defensive manager will find himself in the unpleasant situation of having his left-handed specialist (who likely seldom sees right-handers in game action and may struggle badly against them) against a right-handed hitter. The defensive manager, however, may consider this an acceptable tradeoff versus facing the original left-handed batter with his right-handed pitcher.\n\nStarting pitchers, and sometimes long relievers, will often face batters who hit from both sides of the plate as a matter of course. This is considered a part of their job, and the ability to retire batters from either side of the plate is an important asset for any starting pitcher. Most starters, especially those who rely on ball movement rather than power, are still stronger throwing against one side of the plate, however, the difference is often less pronounced than that for pitchers in the bullpen. Late in close games, when the starter is tiring and baserunners become more important, a starter may be lifted for a specialist, but a starting pitcher is \"very\" seldom replaced with a specialist without having first worked deep into a close ballgame.\n\nSimilarly, position players must accept facing both left-handed and right-handed pitching as part of their job. Managers will usually juggle batters who are exceptionally weak against one sort of pitcher so that they only face starting pitchers who offer favorable matchups, but it is impossible to shield a batter from every instance in which he will face a pitcher who has him at a disadvantage. As a result, a position player must be prepared at all times to face a lefty-righty switch in a situation where his team cannot afford to pinch hit for him.\n\nThis tactical maneuvering has led to the statistical oddity of a pitcher pitching in a game without throwing a single pitch. On June 29, 2018, the Cleveland Indians visited the Oakland Athletics. In the bottom of the seventh inning with two outs and two runners on base, the A's were leading 2-0 with left-handed hitters Dustin Fowler and Matt Joyce coming up. Indians manager Terry Francona replaced his right-handed starter Trevor Bauer with left-handed specialist Oliver Perez. The A's countered by pinch-hitting Mark Canha for Fowler, whom Perez intentionally walked by holding out four fingers to the home plate umpire (a newly implemented option for the 2018 season). But this loaded the bases for Chad Pinder, who pinch-hit for Joyce.

The five were advisors to Catholic Sigismund or political opponents of the latter's uncle and adversary, the Swedish regent Duke Charles.\n\nKing Sigismund, eldest son to King John III, had inherited the crown from his father and been crowned the rightful king of Sweden after giving assurances that he would not act to aid the Catholic cause in Sweden during the mounting religious turmoil of the counter-reformation in the late 16th century. He violated the agreement, setting off civil war in Sweden. After trying to manage the Swedish situation from afar, Sigismund invaded with a mercenary army after receiving permission from the Polish legislature, and initially was successful. The turning point of his Swedish campaign was the Battle of Stångebro on 25 September 1598, also known as the Battle of Linköping, where Sigismund became trapped in an unfavourable position and had to agree to a truce with Charles. One of Charles' conditions for the truce was the handing over of Swedish privy counsellors from Sigismund's camp. Sigismund complied.\n\nMost prominent among these Swedish senators was the Chancellor of Sweden, Erik Sparre. While Charles did not detain Sigismund as well, he forced him to agree to the Treaty of Linköping and to agree that their dispute would be settled by a future Riksdag of the Estates in Stockholm. Sigismund retreated to the port of Kalmar, but instead of sailing to Stockholm, he took his sister Anna, left for Danzig in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and never returned to Sweden again. Charles then crushed the remaining military opposition from forces loyal to Sigismund and those nobles who had previously taken control of Finland in the Cudgel War. During these campaigns, some nobles were tried, executed or detained. Executions, including the so-called Åbo Bloodbath, were carried out through decapitation or impalement, Charles himself executed a son of his adversary Clas Fleming.\n\nWhen in March 1600 a riksdag met in Linköping, Charles, who was meanwhile created omnipotent ruler of Sweden and had repeatedly been offered the Swedish crown, set up a court to try his remaining prisoners. The court, headed by Axel Leijonhufvud and Erik Brahe, consisted of 155 members, with Charles himself being the prosecutor. Tried were six nobles captured in Stångebro and two Finnish nobles captured later, including Arvid Stålarm, who in 1598 had intended to aid Sigismund in Stångebro, but aborted the action when his army had reached Stockholm from Finland only after Sigismund had accepted the aforementioned truce. The other Finnish noble, Axel Kurck, was sentenced to death along with Stålarm in Finland already, but the verdict had been suspended to again try them in Linköping. These eight noblemen were eventually sentenced to death, but three of them were pardoned.\n\nThe noblemen publicly executed on the Linköping market square on 20 March 1600 were:\n\nSigismund, who was allowed to return to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, did not relinquish his desire to regain the throne of Sweden. This attitude led to a series of Polish–Swedish wars, that culminated during the reign of his son, John II Casimir of Poland, with the giant Swedish invasion of Poland known as the Deluge, ending the golden age of the Commonwealth. On 24 July 1599, the \"Riksens ständer\" (\"Riksdag\") in Stockholm officially dethroned Sigismund and named Charles IX Vasa as regent, and the Polish–Swedish union was dissolved after barely seven years of existence. Subsequently, Charles IX of Sweden was named by the \"Riksens ständer\" as the new King of Sweden in 1604, and the crown would pass to Gustavus the Great, who established his early reputation as an outstanding military leader in campaigns during the early years of the Polish–Swedish wars. Indirectly, the religious conflict in Sweden led to the Swedish Empire as Gustavus and his generals became militant in the cause of Protestants in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\n"}

She was the lover and editor of the writer Yone Noguchi and the mother of sculptor Isamu Noguchi and dancer Ailes Gilmour. She is the subject of the feature film \"Leonie\" (2010) and the book \"Leonie Gilmour: When East Weds West\" (2013).\n\nLéonie Gilmour was born in New York City on June 17, 1873, and grew up in the East Village, Manhattan. At the time of her birth, her father, Andrew Gilmour, a clerk, and mother, Albiana Gilmour (née Smith, daughter of one of the co-founders of the \"Brooklyn Times-Union\"), were living \"in one room in a rear house\" in St. Bridget's Place, the alley behind St. Brigid's Church on the east side of Tompkins Square Park. Léonie was among the first students at the Free Kindergarten organized by Felix Adler's Ethical Culture Society and became a member of the first class of the Workingman's School (later Ethical Culture School). After her graduation in 1887, Adler found a place for her at the recently opened Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore. As one of the few students to pass the Bryn Mawr School's rigorous graduation requirements, she was awarded its first four-year college scholarship, funded by school president Mary Garrett.\n\nAs was expected, Gilmour enrolled at Bryn Mawr College in the fall of 1891. Despite an early interest in Chemistry, she eventually chose to major in History and Political Science as her major fields. In her third year, following the example of many students preparing for the school's rigorous foreign language exams (which required students to translate on sight from Greek, Latin, French and German), Léonie decided to spend a year abroad studying at the Sorbonne in Paris. Upon her return in the fall of 1894, she was assigned to the same residence hall dining table as incoming student Catharine Bunnell (niece of future Yale benefactor John William Sterling), and the two became lifelong friends. In January 1895, an illness leading to hospitalization led to Gilmour's withdrawal from the college, her transcript citing \"reasons of health,\" although Gilmour's biographer speculates that the expiration of her four-year scholarship the previous year may have been a contributing factor. She never completed her degree. Her friend Catharine Bunnell also withdrew from the college at the end of the year.\n\nAfter leaving Bryn Mawr College in 1896, she taught at Academy of St. Aloysius in New Jersey and worked at various editing jobs. In 1901, she answered a classified advertisement placed by Yone Noguchi, a 25-year-old Japanese writer who had recently arrived in New York. Noguchi had spent seven years in California and had published two books of English poetry, but his mastery of English was insecure. Gilmour agreed to become his editor. The relationship proved successful, and with Gilmour's assistance, Noguchi resumed work on a fictional diary of a Japanese girl published in 1902 as \"The American Diary of a Japanese Girl\".\n\nFollowing Noguchi's return from England in 1903, the relationship took an amorous turn, and on November 18, Noguchi wrote out a declaration of questionable legality stating that \"Leonie Gilmour is my Lawful wife.\" The marriage remained secret and the two continued to maintain separate residences. When the arrangement proved less than successful, it appeared that the experiment would simply be brought to an end in the early months of 1904 with no one being the wiser. Noguchi resumed his relationship with Washington, D.C. journalist Ethel Armes and with the onset of the Russo-Japanese War, began making plans to return to Japan in the fall.\n\nTrouble developed, however, when Gilmour discovered she had become pregnant during the waning days of the relationship. Rather than pressing Noguchi for a reconciliation, she chose to join her mother in Los Angeles, and gave birth to Isamu Noguchi on November 18, 1904.\n\nThe birth was publicized when a \"Los Angeles Herald\" reporter visited Léonie in the hospital. After Ethel Armes confirmed the truth of the story and canceled her engagement to Noguchi, Noguchi began attempting to persuade Gilmour to come to Japan. Léonie resisted for some months before finally agreeing. By the time she arrived in March 1907 Noguchi had become involved with a Japanese woman, Takeda Matsuko.\n\nIn Tokyo, Gilmour worked primarily as a teacher and resumed her helpful role as Noguchi's editorial assistant. Unable to use her alma mater connection with Tsuda Umeko to secure a position at Tsuda College as she hoped, Léonie worked at a Yokohama school and privately tutored the children of the late Lafcadio Hearn, among others.\n\nDomestic arrangements proved strained even before Léonie belatedly learned of the existence of Takeda Matsuko, around the time of Matsuko's second pregnancy by Noguchi. Léonie separated from Noguchi in 1909, taking Isamu, and living in a series of residences in Ōmori, Yokohama and Chigasaki. In 1912 as a result of a relationship with a man whose identity remains mysterious (Isamu Noguchi biographer Masayo Duus speculates that he was one of Léonie's students) she gave birth to a daughter, Ailes Gilmour.\n\nGilmour sent Isamu back to the United States to attend an experimental school in 1918. She and Ailes continued to reside in Japan until 1920 when they returned to the United States, settling in San Francisco, and later moving to New York, where she successfully dissuaded Isamu from his plan to attend medical school and redirected him to the artist's vocation she had chosen for him when he was still an infant. Ailes was sent to a progressive school in Connecticut.\n\nGilmour herself made ends meet through a small import/export business and various other jobs. In December 1933 she was admitted to New York's Bellevue Hospital with pneumonia and died on New Year's Eve of coronary thrombosis with arteriosclerosis as a contributory factor.\n\nAlthough Gilmour harbored literary aspirations, her achievements as a writer were limited. Much of her literary energy was channeled into her editorial projects, particularly those of her partner, Yone Noguchi. It has been speculated that she may have co-authored or authored some works attributed to him, such as \"The American Diary of a Japanese Girl\", and there is little doubt that much of Noguchi's best writing was accomplished with her editorial assistance.\n\nAs an author in her own right, Gilmour's most successful pieces were short autobiographical essays for newspapers and magazines chronicling unfortunate events with a wry ironic humor, In a picaresque, matter-of-fact style, Gilmour described the unusual situations in which she found herself as a result of her unconventional attitudes and lifestyle. Gilmour's \"Founding a Tent-Home in California,\" for example, shows turn-of-the-century Los Angeles from the perspective of a hapless, idealistic new arrival. \"Dorobo, or the Japanese Burglar\" portrays the experience of being burglarized with a humorous perspective.\n\nNear the end of her life, at the request of her son, Gilmour had begun writing a memoir which she referred to as \"the book.\" This evidently included the brief account of her childhood entitled \"St. Bridget's Child,\" as well as \"The Kid Chronicle that Was Not Written\" (describing her meeting and correspondence with Charles Warren Stoddard) and \"Inside Looking On: When East Weds West.\" All of these were unpublished at the time of her death, as was her story about Ailes' arrival in San Francisco, \"Ai-chan Goes to Frisco.\"\n\nGilmour's unconventional life and perspectives have made her the subject of interest among scholars and a Japanese filmmaker. In 2009, Japanese filmmaker began production of \"Leonie\", a film based on Gilmour's life. Actress Emily Mortimer played the role of Gilmour in the film. A book, \"Leonie Gilmour: When East Weds West\", including a biography of Gilmour by Edward Marx, along with Gilmour's collected writings, was published in 2013.\n\n\n"}

It lives in South Australia, nesting in old-growth mallee woodland and \"Eucalyptus\" woodland. The full distribution of \"Nothomyrmecia\" has never been assessed, and it is unknown how widespread it really is; its potential range may be wider if it does favour old-growth mallee woodland. Possible threats to its survival include habitat destruction and climate change. \"Nothomyrmecia\" is most active when it is cold because workers encounter fewer competitors and predators such as \"Camponotus\" and \"Iridomyrmex\", and it also increases hunting success. Thus, the increase of temperature may prevent them from foraging and very few areas would be suitable for the ant to live in. As a result, the IUCN lists the ant as Critically Endangered.\n\nA medium-sized ant, \"Nothomyrmecia\" measures . Workers are monomorphic, showing little morphological differentiation among one another. Mature colonies are very small, with only 50 to 100 individuals in each nest. Workers are strictly nocturnal (active mainly at night) and are solitary foragers, collecting arthropod prey and sweet substances such as honeydew from scale insects and other Hemiptera. They rely on their vision to navigate and there is no evidence to suggest that the species use chemicals to communicate when foraging, but they do use chemical alarm signals. A queen ant will mate with one or more males and, during colony foundation, she will hunt for food until the brood have fully developed. Queens are univoltine (i.e. they produce just one generation of ants each year). Two queens may establish a colony together, but only one will remain once the first generation of workers has been reared.\n\n\"Nothomyrmecia\" was first described by Australian entomologist John S. Clark in 1934 from two specimens of worker ants. These were reportedly collected in 1931 near the Russell Range, inland from Israelite Bay in Western Australia. After its initial discovery, the ant was not seen again for four decades until a group of entomologists rediscovered it in 1977, away from the original reported site. Dubbed as the 'Holy Grail' of myrmecology, the ant was subject to great scientific interest after its rediscovery, attracting scientists from around the world. In Poochera (the rediscovery site), pictures of the ant are stenciled on the streets, and it is perhaps the only town in the world that thrives off ant-based tourism. Some entomologists have suggested a relationship to the Baltic Eocene fossil ant genus \"Prionomyrmex\" based on morphological similarities, but this interpretation is not widely accepted by the entomological community. Owing to its body structure, \"Nothomyrmecia\" is regarded to be the most primitive ant alive and a 'living fossil', stimulating studies on its morphology, behaviour, ecology, and chromosomes.\n\n\"Nothomyrmecia\" is a medium-sized ant, measuring in length. Workers are monomorphic, meaning that there is little morphological differentiation among one another. The mandibles, clypeus (one of the sclerites that make up the \"face\" of an arthropod or insect), antennae and legs are pale yellow. The hairs on the body are yellow, erect and long and abundant, but on the antennae and legs they are shorter and suberect (standing almost in an erect position). Though it shows similar characteristics to \"Myrmecia\", \"Nothomyrmecia\" somewhat resembles \"Oecophylla\", commonly known as weaver ants. Workers are strictly nocturnal (active mainly at night) but navigate by vision, relying on large compound eyes. The mandibles are shorter than the head. They have 10 to 15 intermeshing teeth and are less specialised than those of \"Myrmecia\" and \"Prionomyrmex\", being elongate and triangular. The head is longer than it is wide and broader towards the back. The sides of the head are convex around the eyes. The long antennal scapes (the base of the antenna) extend beyond the occipital border, and the second segment of the funiculus (a series of segments between the base and club) is slightly longer than the first, third and fourth segment. The node, pronotum, epinotum and thorax are longer than broad, and the mesonotum is just as long as it is wide. The first segment of the gaster (the bulbous posterior portion of the metasoma) is broader than long by a third and broader at the back than the front with strongly convex sides.\n\nA long and retractable stinger is present at the rear of the abdomen. It has been described as \"prominent and effective\" and is capable of inflicting a painful sting to humans. A 'sting bulb gland' is also present in \"Nothomyrmecia\"; this is a small exocrine gland of unknown function, first discovered and named in 1990. It is situated in the basal part of the insect's sting, and is located between the two ducts of the venom gland and the Dufour's gland. Despite its many primitive features, the sting apparatus of \"Nothomyrmecia\" is considered less primitive than those found in other ants such as \"Stigmatomma pallipes\". It is the only known species of ant that contains both a sting and a 'waist' (i.e. it has no postpetiole between the first and second gastral segments).\nQueens look similar to workers, but several morphological features distinguish the two castes from each other. Although their body structure is similar to that of workers, the queens are usually larger. Ocelli are highly developed, but the eyes on the queen are not enlarged. The structure of the pterothorax (the wing-bearing area of the thorax) is consistent with other reproductive ants, although it does not occupy as much of its mesosomal bulk. The wings of the queens are reduced to the point that they are not functional (they are brachypterous). Their wings are noticeably rudimentary and stubby, barely overlapping the first gastral segment. Males resemble those of \"Myrmecia\", but \"Nothomyrmecia\" males bear a single waist node. The wings on the male ant are not stubby like a queen's; rather they are long and fully developed, exhibiting a primitive venational complement, They have a jugal anal lobe (a portion of the hindwing), a feature found in many primitive ants, and basal hamuli (hook-like projections that link the forewings and hindwings). Most male specimens collected have two tibial spurs (spines located on the distal end of the tibia); the first spur is a long calcar while the second spur is short and thick. Adults have a stridulatory organ on the ventral side of the abdomen – unlike all other hymenopterans in which such organs are located dorsally.\n\nIn all castes, these ants have six maxillary palps (palps that serve as organs of touch and taste in feeding) and four labial palps (sensory structures on the labium), a highly primitive feature. The females have a 12-segmented antenna, whereas males have 13 segments. Other features include paired calcariae found on both the hind and middle tibiae, and the claws have a median tooth. The unspecialised nature of the cuticle (outer exoskeleton of the body) is similar to \"Pseudomyrmex\", a member of the subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae. Many of the features known in \"Nothomyrmecia\" are found in Ponerinae and Pseudomyrmecinae.\nThe eggs of \"Nothomyrmecia\" are similar to those of \"Myrmecia\", being subspherical and non-adhesive. The larvae bear a primitive body structure with no specialised tubercles, sharing similar characteristics with the subfamily Ponerinae, but the sensilla are more abundant on the mouthparts. The larvae are characterised into three stages: very young, young, and mature, measuring , and , respectively. The cocoons have thin walls and produce meconium (a metabolic waste product expelled through the anal opening after an insect emerges from its pupal stage). The cuticular hydrocarbons have internally branched alkenes, a feature rarely found in ants and most insects.\n\nIn general, the body structure of all \"Nothomyrmecia\" castes demonstrates the primitive nature of the species. Notable derived features include vestigal ocelli on workers, brachypterous queens, and the mesoscutal structure on males. The morphology of the abdomen, mandibles, gonoforceps (a sclerite, serving as the base of the ovipositors sheath) and basal hamuli show it is more primitive than \"Myrmecia\". The structure of the abdominal region can separate it from other Myrmeciinae relatives (the fourth abdominal segment of \"Myrmecia\" is tubulate, whereas \"Nothomyrmecia\" has a non-tubulated abdominal segment). The appearance of the fourth abdominal segment is consistent with almost all aculeate insects, and possibly \"Sphecomyrma\".\n\nThe feature of non-functional, vestigial wings may have evolved in this species relatively recently, as wings might otherwise have long-since disappeared completely had they no function for dispersal. Wing-reduction could somehow relate to population structure or some other specialised ecological pressure. Equally, wing-reduction might be a feature that only forms in drought-stressed colonies, as has been observed in several \"Monomorium\" ant species found throughout semi-arid regions of Australia. As yet, scientists do not fully understand how the feature of non-functional, vestigial wings arose in \"Nothomyrmecia macrops\".\n\nThe first collection of \"Nothomyrmecia\" was made in December 1931 by amateur entomologist, Amy Crocker, whose colleagues had collected a range of insect samples for her during a field excursion, including specimens of two worker ants, reportedly near the Russell Range, inland from Israelite Bay in Western Australia. Crocker then passed the ants to Australian entomologist John S. Clark. Recognised shortly afterwards as a new species, these specimens became the syntypes. Entomologist Robert W. Taylor subsequently expressed doubt about the accuracy of recording of the original discovery site, stating the specimens were probably collected from the western end of the Great Australian Bight, south from Balladonia. The discovery of \"Nothomyrmecia\" and the appearance of its unique body structure led scientists in 1951 to initiate a series of searches to find the ant in Western Australia. Over three decades, teams of Australian and American collectors failed to re-find it; entomologists such as E. O. Wilson and William Brown, Jr., made attempts to search for it, but neither was successful. Then, on 22 October 1977, Taylor and his party of entomologists from Canberra serendipitously discovered a solitary worker ant at Poochera, southeast of Ceduna, some from the reported site of the 1931 discovery. In 2012, a report discussing the possible presence of \"Nothomyrmecia\" in Western Australia did not confirm any sighting of the ant between Balladonia and the Western Australian coastal regions. After 46 years of searching for it, entomologists have dubbed the ant the 'Holy Grail' of myrmecology.\n\nIn 1934 entomologist John S. Clark published a formal description of \"Nothomyrmecia macrops\" as a new species and within a completely new genus and tribe (Nothomyrmecii) of the Ponerinae. He did so because the two specimens (which then became the syntypes) bore no resemblance to any ant species he knew of, although they did share similar morphological characteristics with the extinct genus \"Prionomyrmex\". Clark notes that the head and mandibles of \"Nothomyrmecia\" and \"Prionomyrmex\" are somewhat similar, but the two can be distinguished by the appearance of the node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster). In 1951, Clark proposed the new ant subfamily Nothomyrmeciinae for his \"Nothomyrmecia\", based on morphological differences with other ponerine ants. This proposal was rejected by American entomologist William Brown Jr., who would place it into the subfamily Myrmeciinae with \"Myrmecia\" and \"Prionomyrmex\", under the tribe Nothomyrmeciini. Its distant relationship with extant ants was confirmed after its rediscovery, and its placement within the Formicidae was accepted by most scientists until the late 1980s. The single waist node led scientists to believe that \"Nothomyrmecia\" should be separate from \"Myrmecia\" and retained Clark's original proposal. This proposal would place the ant into its own subfamily, despite many familiar morphological characteristics between the two genera. This separation from \"Myrmecia\" was retained until 2000.\nIn 2000, entomologist Cesare Baroni Urbani described a new Baltic fossil \"Prionomyrmex\" species (\"P. janzeni\"). After examining specimens of \"Nothomyrmecia\", Baroni Urbani stated that his new species and \"N. macrops\" were so morphologically similar that they belonged to the same genus. He proposed that the name \"Prionomyrmex\" should replace the name \"Nothomyrmecia\" (which would then be just a synonym), and also that the subfamily Nothomyrmeciinae should be called Prionomyrmeciinae.\n\nIn 2003, Russian palaeoentomologists G. M. Dlussky and E. B. Perfilieva separated \"Nothomyrmecia\" from \"Prionomyrmex\" on the basis of the fusion of an abdominal segment. In the same year, American entomologists P. S. Ward and S. G. Brady reached the same conclusion as Dlussky and Perfilieva and provided strong support for the monophyly of \"Prionomyrmex\". Ward and Brady also transferred both taxa as distinct genera in the older subfamily Myrmeciinae under the tribe Prionomyrmecini. In 2005 and 2008, Baroni Urbani suggested further evidence in favour of his former interpretation as opposed to Ward and Brady's. This view is not supported in subsequent relevant papers, which continue to use the classification of Ward and Brady, rejecting that of Baroni Urbani.\n\nThe ant is commonly known as the dinosaur ant, dawn ant, or living fossil ant because of its primitive body structure. The generic name \"Nothomyrmecia\" means \"false bulldog ant\". Its specific epithet, \"macrops\" (\"big eyes\"), is derived from the Greek words ', meaning \"long\", or \"large\", and ', meaning \"eyes\".\n\nStudies show that all hymenopteran insects that have a diploid (2n) chromosome count above 52 are themselves all ants; \"Nothomyrmecia\" and another Ponerinae ant, \"Platythyrea tricuspidata\", share the highest number of chromosomes within all the Hymenoptera, having a diploid chromosome number of 92–94.\n\nGenetic evidence suggests that the age of the most recent common ancestor for \"Nothomyrmecia\" and \"Myrmecia\" is approximately 74 million years old, giving a likely origin in the Cretaceous. There are two hypotheses of the internal phylogeny of \"Nothomyrmecia\": subfamily Formicinae is more closely related to \"Nothomyrmecia\" than it is to \"Myrmecia\", evolving from \"Nothomyrmecia\"-like ancestors. Alternatively, \"Nothomyrmecia\" and Aneuretinae may have shared a common ancestor; the two most likely separated from each other, and the first formicines evolved from the Aneuretinae instead. Currently, scientists agree that \"Nothomyrmecia\" most likely evolved from ancestors to the Ponerinae. \"Nothomyrmecia\" and other primitive ant genera such as \"Amblyopone\" and \"Myrmecia\" exhibit behaviour similar to a clade of soil-dwelling families of vespoid wasps. The following cladogram generated by Canadian entomologist S. B. Archibald and his colleagues shows the possible phylogenetic position of \"Nothomyrmecia\" among some ants of the subfamily Myrmeciinae. They suggest that \"Nothomyrmecia\" may be closely related to extinct Myrmeciinae ants such as \"Avitomyrmex\", \"Macabeemyrma\", \"Prionomyrmex\", and \"Ypresiomyrma\".\n\n\"Nothomyrmecia\" is present in the cool regions of South Australia within mallee woodland and especially old-growth areas populated with various \"Eucalyptus\" species, including \"Eucalyptus brachycalyx\", \"E. gracilis\" and \"E. oleosa\". It is possible that it also occurs in Western Australia, from where it was first collected. The full distribution of \"Nothomyrmecia\" has never been assessed, and it is unknown how widespread it really is. If it does favour old-growth mallee woodland, it could have the potential for a wider range than is currently known from surveys and museum specimens. In 1998, \"Nothomyrmecia\" colonies were located in 18 areas along the Eyre Peninsula by a team of entomologists, a stretch of .\n\nNests are found in degraded limestone soil with \"Callitris\" trees present. Colony construction only occurs when the soil is moist. Nest entrance holes are difficult to detect as they are only in width, and are located under shallow leaf litter with no mounds or soil deposits present, although guards are regularly seen. A single gallery, in diameter, forms inside a \"Nothomyrmecia\" colony. This gallery descends steeply into the ground towards a somewhat elliptical and horizontal chamber that is in diameter and in height. This chamber is typically below the soil's surface.\n\nWorkers are nectarivores and can be found foraging on top of \"Eucalyptus\" trees, where they search for food and prey for the larvae. However, workers are known to drink hemolymph from the insects they capture, and a queen in a captive colony was observed consuming a fly. Captured prey items are given to larvae, which are carnivorous. The workers search for prey in piles of leaves, killing small arthropods including \"Drosophila\" flies, microlepidopterans and spiderlings. Prey items are usually less than in size, and workers grab them using their mandibles and forelegs, then kill them with their sting. Workers also feed on sweet substances such as honeydew secreted by scale insects and other Hemiptera; one worker alone may feed on these sources for 30 minutes. Pupae may be given to the larvae if a colony has a shortage of food. Workers are able to lay unfertilised eggs specifically to feed the larvae; these are known as trophic eggs. Sometimes the adults, including the queen and other sexually active ants, consume these eggs. Workers transfer food to other nestmates, including winged adults and larvae; the anal droplets are exuded by the larvae, which are taken up by the workers.\n\nAge caste polyethism does not occur in \"Nothomyrmecia\", where the younger workers act as nurses and tend to the brood and the older workers go out and forage. The only ant known other than \"Nothomyrmecia\" which does not exhibit age caste polyethism is \"Stigmatomma pallipes\". Workers are strictly nocturnal, and only emerge from their nests on cold nights. They are most active at temperatures of , and are much more difficult to locate on warmer nights. Workers are possibly most active when it is cold because at these times they encounter fewer and less aggressive competitors, including other more dominant diurnal ant species that are sometimes found foraging during warm nights. Cold temperatures may also hamper the escape of prey items, so increasing the ants' hunting success. Unless a forager has captured prey, workers stay on trees for the remainder of the night until dawn, possibly relying on sunlight to navigate back to their nest. There is no evidence that they use chemical trails when foraging; instead, workers rely on visual cues to navigate around. However, chemical markers may play an important role in recognising nest entrances. The ants are solitary foragers. Waste material, such as dead nestmates, cocoon shells, and food remnants, are disposed of far away from the nest.\n\nWorkers from different \"Nothomyrmecia\" colonies are not antagonistic towards one another, so they can forage together on a single tree, although they do attack if an outsider tries to enter an underground colony. Ants such as \"Camponotus\" and \"Iridomyrmex\" may pose a threat to foragers or to a colony if they try to enter; foraging workers that encounter \"Iridomyrmex\" ants are vigorously attacked and killed. \"Nothomyrmecia\" workers counter this by secreting alarm pheromones from the mandibular gland and Dufour's gland. Foraging workers also engage in alternative methods to protect themselves from predators. Adopting a posture by opening the jaws in a threatening stance or deliberately falling onto the ground and remaining motionless until the threat subsides are two known methods. With that said, \"Nothomyrmecia\" is a timid and shy species that retreats if exposed.\n\nNuptial flight (meaning that virgin queens and males emerge to mate) does not occur in \"Nothomyrmecia\". Instead, they engage in long-range dispersal (they walk away from the colony for some distance and mate) which presumably begins by late summer or autumn, with the winged adults emerging around March and April, but sometimes a colony may overwinter (a process by which an organism waits out the winter season). These winged adults, born around January, are usually quite young when they begin to mate. Queens are seen around vegetation trying to flutter their vestigial wings – a behaviour seen in some brachypterous \"Myrmecia\" queens. Due to the queen's brachypterous wings, it is likely that the winged adults mate near their parent nest and release sex pheromones, or instead climb on vegetation far away from their nests and attract fully winged males. \"Nothomyrmecia\" is a polyandrous ant, in which queens mate with one or more males. In one study of 32 colonies, it was found that queens mated with an average of 1.37 males. After mating, new colonies can be founded by one or more queens, though a colony with two queens reduces to a single queen when the nest is mature, forming colonies that are termed monogynous. The queens will compete for dominance, and the subordinate queen is later expelled by workers who drag her outside the nest. An existing nest with no queen may adopt a foraging queen looking for an area to begin her colony, as well as workers. Queens are semi-claustral, meaning that during the initial establishment of the new colony the queen will forage among the worker ants so that she can ensure sufficient food to raise her brood. Sometimes a queen will leave her nest at night with the sole purpose of finding food or water for herself.\n\nEggs are not seen in nests from April to September. They are laid by late December and develop into adults by mid-February, although pupation does not occur until March. However, \"Nothomyrmecia\" is univoltine, meaning that the queen produces a single generation of eggs per season, and it sometimes may take as many as 12 months for an egg to develop into an adult. Adults are defined as either juveniles or post-juveniles: juveniles are too young (perhaps several months old) to have experienced overwintering whereas post-juveniles have. The pupae generally overwinter and begin to hatch by the time a new generation of eggs is laid. Workers are capable of laying reproductive eggs, although it is not known if these develop into males, females or both. This uncertainty results from the suggestion that, because some colonies have been shown to have high levels of genetic diversity, worker ants could be inseminated by males and act as supplementary reproductives. Eggs are scattered among the nest, whereas the larvae and pupae are set apart from each other in groups. The larvae are capable of crawling around the nest. When the larvae are ready to spin their cocoons, they swell up and are later buried by workers in the ground to allow cocoon formation. Small non-aggressive workers that act as nurses provide assistance for newborns to hatch from their cocoons. At maturity, a nest may only contain 50 to 100 adults. In some nests, colony founding can occur within a colony itself: when a queen dies, the colony may be taken over by one of her daughters, or it may adopt a newly mated queen, restricting reproduction among workers; this method of founding extends the lifespan of the colony almost indefinitely.\n\nBefore its rediscovery in 1977, entomologists feared that \"Nothomyrmecia\" had already become extinct. The ant was listed as a protected species under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. In 1996, the International Union for Conservation of Nature listed \"Nothomyrmecia\" as Critically Endangered, stating that only a few small colonies were known. However, the Threatened Species Scientific Committee states that the species is ineligible for listing under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. This is because there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that populations are declining. Colonies are also naturally depauperate (lacking in numbers of ants), and their distribution is potentially quite extensive across southern Australia, due to the ants' preference for old-growth mallee woodland. With 18 sites known for this species, and the potential for many more being discovered, there seems little immediate possibility of extinction. With this said, it is unknown how widespread it actually is, and scientists are not yet clear what, if any, threats affect it.\n\nAlthough threats are not known for certain, suspected anthropogenic threats that can significantly affect \"Nothomyrmecia\" include habitat destruction and fragmentation by railway lines, roads and wheat fields. In the town of Ceduna, west of Poochera, local populations of the ant were almost eliminated after the area was bulldozed and burned during the installation of an underground telephone line, although nearby sites had larger populations than those found in the destroyed site. Colonies may not survive tree-clearing, as they depend on overhead canopies to navigate. Bushfires are another major threat to the survival of \"Nothomyrmecia\", potentially destroying valuable food sources, including the trees they forage on, and reducing the population of a colony. Although these ants may have recovered from previous bushfires, larger, more frequent fires may devastate the population. However, \"Nothomyrmecia\" ants can be safe from fires if they remain inside their nests. Climate change could be a threat to their survival, as they depend on cold temperatures to forage and collect food. An increase in the temperature will prevent workers from foraging, and very few areas would be suitable for the species to live in. The cold winds blowing off the Southern Ocean allow \"Nothomyrmecia\" to benefit from the cool temperatures they need for night-time foraging, so an increase in sea temperature could also potentially threaten it.\n\nConservationists suggest that conducting surveys, maintaining known populations through habitat protection and fighting climate change may ensure the survival of \"Nothomyrmecia\". They also advocate protection of remaining mallee habitat from degradation, and for management actions to improve tree and understorey structure. Because most known populations are found outside protected areas in vegetation alongside roads, a species management plan is required to identify other key actions, including making local councils aware of the presence, conservation status and habitat requirement of \"Nothomyrmecia\". This could result in future land use and management being decided more appropriately at the local level. Not all colonies are found in unprotected areas; some have been discovered in the Lake Gilles Conservation Park and the Chadinga Conservation Reserve. More research is needed to know the true extent of the ant's geographical distribution.\n\n\"Nothomyrmecia macrops\" is widely regarded as the most primitive living ant and, as such, has aroused considerable interest among the entomological community. Following its rediscovery it was the subject of a prolonged and rigorous series of studies involving Australian, American and European ant specialists and it soon became one of the most studied ant species on the planet. \"Nothomyrmecia\" can be cultured with ease, and could potentially prove a useful subject for research into learning in insects as well as the physiology of nocturnal vision. Since its chance discovery at Poochera, the town has become of international interest to myrmecologists, and it is possibly the only town in the world with ant-based tourism. Promoting it as a tourist attraction, \"Nothomyrmecia\" has been adopted as the emblem of the Poochera community. Pictures of the ant have been stencilled onto the pavements, and a large sculpture of \"Nothomyrmecia\" has been erected in the town.\n\n"}

{"id": "640697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=640697", "title": "Reactive oxygen species", "text": "Reactive oxygen species\n\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically reactive chemical species containing oxygen. Examples include peroxides, superoxide, hydroxyl radical, singlet oxygen, and alpha-oxygen.\n\nIn a biological context, ROS are formed as a natural byproduct of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signaling and homeostasis. However, during times of environmental stress (e.g., UV or heat exposure), ROS levels can increase dramatically. This may result in significant damage to cell structures. Cumulatively, this is known as oxidative stress. The production of ROS is strongly influenced by stress factor responses in plants, these factors that increase ROS production include, drought, salinity, chilling, nutrient deficiency, metal toxicity and UV-B radiation. ROS are also generated by exogenous sources such as ionizing radiation.\n\nThe reduction of molecular oxygen (O) produces superoxide () and is the precursor of most other reactive oxygen species:\n\nDismutation of superoxide produces hydrogen peroxide (HO):\n\nHydrogen peroxide in turn may be partially reduced to hydroxyl radical (OH) or fully reduced to water:\n\nExogenous ROS can be produced from pollutants, tobacco, smoke, drugs, xenobiotics, or radiation.\n\nIonizing radiation can generate damaging intermediates through the interaction with water, a process termed radiolysis. Since water comprises 55–60% of the human body, the probability of radiolysis is quite high under the presence of ionizing radiation. In the process, water loses an electron and becomes highly reactive. Then through a three-step chain reaction, water is sequentially converted to hydroxyl radical (OH), hydrogen peroxide (HO), superoxide radical (), and ultimately oxygen (O).\n\nThe hydroxyl radical is extremely reactive and immediately removes electrons from any molecule in its path, turning that molecule into a free radical and thus propagating a chain reaction. However, hydrogen peroxide is actually more damaging to DNA than the hydroxyl radical, since the lower reactivity of hydrogen peroxide provides enough time for the molecule to travel into the nucleus of the cell, subsequently reacting with macromolecules such as DNA.\n\nROS are produced intracellularly through multiple mechanisms and depending on the cell and tissue types, the major sources being the \"professional\" producers of ROS: NADPH oxidase (NOX) complexes (7 distinct isoforms) in cell membranes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and endoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondria convert energy for the cell into a usable form, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The process in which ATP is produced, called oxidative phosphorylation, involves the transport of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane by means of the electron transport chain. In the electron transport chain, electrons are passed through a series of proteins via oxidation-reduction reactions, with each acceptor protein along the chain having a greater reduction potential than the previous. The last destination for an electron along this chain is an oxygen molecule. In normal conditions, the oxygen is reduced to produce water; however, in about 0.1–2% of electrons passing through the chain (this number derives from studies in isolated mitochondria, though the exact rate in live organisms is yet to be fully agreed upon), oxygen is instead prematurely and incompletely reduced to give the superoxide radical (), most well documented for Complex I and Complex III. Superoxide is not particularly reactive by itself, but can inactivate specific enzymes or initiate lipid peroxidation in its protonated form, hydroperoxyl HO. The p\"K\" of hydroperoxyl is 4.8. Thus, at physiological pH, the majority will exist as superoxide anion.\n\nIf too much damage is present in mitochondria, a cell undergoes apoptosis or programmed cell death. Bcl-2 proteins are layered on the surface of the mitochondria, detect damage, and activate a class of proteins called Bax, which punch holes in the mitochondrial membrane, causing cytochrome C to leak out. This cytochrome C binds to Apaf-1, or apoptotic protease activating factor-1, which is free-floating in the cell's cytoplasm. Using energy from the ATPs in the mitochondrion, the Apaf-1 and cytochrome C bind together to form apoptosomes. The apoptosomes bind to and activate caspase-9, another free-floating protein. The caspase-9 then cleaves the proteins of the mitochondrial membrane, causing it to break down and start a chain reaction of protein denaturation and eventually phagocytosis of the cell.\n\nSuperoxide dismutases (SOD) are a class of enzymes that catalyze the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. As such, they are an important antioxidant defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen. In mammals and most chordates, three forms of superoxide dismutase are present. SOD1 is located primarily in the cytoplasm, SOD2 in the mitochondria and SOD3 is extracellular. The first is a dimer (consists of two units), while the others are tetramers (four subunits). SOD1 and SOD3 contain copper and zinc ions, while SOD2 has a manganese ion in its reactive centre. The genes are located on chromosomes 21, 6, and 4, respectively (21q22.1, 6q25.3 and 4p15.3-p15.1).\n\nThe SOD-catalysed dismutation of superoxide may be written with the following half-reactions:\n\nwhere M = Cu (\"n\" = 1); Mn (\"n\" = 2); Fe (\"n\" = 2); Ni (\"n\" = 2). In this reaction the oxidation state of the metal cation oscillates between \"n\" and \"n\" + 1.\n\nCatalase, which is concentrated in peroxisomes located next to mitochondria, reacts with the hydrogen peroxide to catalyze the formation of water and oxygen. Glutathione peroxidase reduces hydrogen peroxide by transferring the energy of the reactive peroxides to a very small sulfur-containing protein called glutathione. The sulfur contained in these enzymes acts as the reactive center, carrying reactive electrons from the peroxide to the glutathione. Peroxiredoxins also degrade HO, within the mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus.\n\n\nAnother type of reactive oxygen species is singlet oxygen (O) which is produced for example as byproduct of photosynthesis in plants. In the presence of light and oxygen, photosensitizers such as chlorophyll may convert triplet (O) to singlet oxygen:\nSinglet oxygen is highly reactive, especially with organic compounds that contain double bonds. The resulting damage caused by singlet oxygen reduces the photosynthetic efficiency of chloroplasts. In plants exposed to excess light, the increased production of singlet oxygen can result in cell death. Various substances such as carotenoids, tocopherols and plastoquinones contained in chloroplasts quench singlet oxygen and protect against its toxic effects. In addition to direct toxicity, singlet oxygen acts a signaling molecule. Oxidized products of β-carotene arising from the presence of singlet oxygen act as second messengers that can either protect against singlet oxygen induced toxicity or initiate programmed cell death. Levels of jasmonate play a key role in the decision between cell acclimation or cell death in response to elevated levels of this reactive oxygen species.\n\nEffects of ROS on cell metabolism are well documented in a variety of species. These include not only roles in apoptosis (programmed cell death) but also positive effects such as the induction of host defencegenes and mobilization of ion transport systems. This implicates them in control of cellular function. In particular, platelets involved in wound repair and blood homeostasis release ROS to recruit additional platelets to sites of injury. These also provide a link to the adaptive immune system via the recruitment of leukocytes.\n\nReactive oxygen species are implicated in cellular activity to a variety of inflammatory responses including cardiovascular disease. They may also be involved in hearing impairment via cochlear damage induced by elevated sound levels, in ototoxicity of drugs such as cisplatin, and in congenital deafness in both animals and humans. ROS are also implicated in mediation of apoptosis or programmed cell death and ischaemic injury. Specific examples include stroke and heart attack.\n\nIn general, harmful effects of reactive oxygen species on the cell are most often:\n\nWhen a plant recognizes an attacking pathogen, one of the first induced reactions is to rapidly produce superoxide () or hydrogen peroxide () to strengthen the cell wall. This prevents the spread of the pathogen to other parts of the plant, essentially forming a net around the pathogen to restrict movement and reproduction.\n\nIn the mammalian host, ROS is induced as an antimicrobial defense. To highlight the importance of this defense, individuals with chronic granulomatous disease who have deficiencies in generating ROS, are highly susceptible to infection by a broad range of microbes including \"Salmonella enterica\", \"Staphylococcus aureus\", \"Serratia marcescens\", and \"Aspergillus\" spp.\n\nThe exact manner in which ROS defends the host from invading microbe is not fully understood. One of the more likely modes of defense is damage to microbial DNA. Studies using Salmonella demonstrated that DNA repair mechanisms were required to resist killing by ROS. More recently, a role for ROS in antiviral defense mechanisms has been demonstrated via Rig-like helicase-1 and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. Increased levels of ROS potentiate signaling through this mitochondria-associated antiviral receptor to activate interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, IRF-7, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), resulting in an antiviral state. Respiratory epithelial cells were recently demonstrated to induce mitrochondrial ROS in response to influenza infection. This induction of ROS led to the induction of type III interferon and the induction of an antiviral state, limiting viral replication. In host defense against mycobacteria, ROS play a role, although direct killing is likely not the key mechanism; rather, ROS likely affect ROS-dependent signalling controls, such as cytokine production, autophagy, and granuloma formation.\n\nReactive oxygen species are also implicated in activation, anergy and apoptosis of T cells.\n\nIn aerobic organisms the energy needed to fuel biological functions is produced in the mitochondria via the electron transport chain. In addition to energy, reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the potential to cause cellular damage are produced. ROS can damage lipid, DNA, RNA, and proteins, which, in theory, contributes to the physiology of aging.\n\nROS are produced as a normal product of cellular metabolism. In particular, one major contributor to oxidative damage is hydrogen peroxide (HO), which is converted from superoxide that leaks from the mitochondria. Catalase and superoxide dismutase ameliorate the damaging effects of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, respectively, by converting these compounds into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (which is later converted to water), resulting in the production of benign molecules. However, this conversion is not 100% efficient, and residual peroxides persist in the cell. While ROS are produced as a product of normal cellular functioning, excessive amounts can cause deleterious effects.\nMemory capabilities decline with age, evident in human degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, which is accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative damage. Current studies demonstrate that the accumulation of ROS can decrease an organism's fitness because oxidative damage is a contributor to senescence. In particular, the accumulation of oxidative damage may lead to cognitive dysfunction, as demonstrated in a study in which old rats were given mitochondrial metabolites and then given cognitive tests. Results showed that the rats performed better after receiving the metabolites, suggesting that the metabolites reduced oxidative damage and improved mitochondrial function. Accumulating oxidative damage can then affect the efficiency of mitochondria and further increase the rate of ROS production. The accumulation of oxidative damage and its implications for aging depends on the particular tissue type where the damage is occurring. Additional experimental results suggest that oxidative damage is responsible for age-related decline in brain functioning. Older gerbils were found to have higher levels of oxidized protein in comparison to younger gerbils. Treatment of old and young mice with a spin trapping compound caused a decrease in the level of oxidized proteins in older gerbils but did not have an effect on younger gerbils. In addition, older gerbils performed cognitive tasks better during treatment but ceased functional capacity when treatment was discontinued, causing oxidized protein levels to increase. This led researchers to conclude that oxidation of cellular proteins is potentially important for brain function.\n\nAccording to the free radical theory of aging, oxidative damage initiated by reactive oxygen species is a major contributor to the functional decline that is characteristic of aging. While studies in invertebrate models indicate that animals genetically engineered to lack specific antioxidant enzymes (such as SOD), in general, show a shortened lifespan (as one would expect from the theory), the converse manipulation, increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes, has yielded inconsistent effects on lifespan (though some studies in \"Drosophila\" do show that lifespan can be increased by the overexpression of MnSOD or glutathione biosynthesizing enzymes). Also contrary to this theory, deletion of mitochondrial SOD2 can extend lifespan in \"Caenorhabditis elegans\".\n\nIn mice, the story is somewhat similar. Deleting antioxidant enzymes, in general, yields shorter lifespan, though overexpression studies have not (with some recent exceptions) consistently extended lifespan. Study of a rat model of premature aging found increased oxidative stress, reduced antioxidant enzyme activity and substantially greater DNA damage in the brain neocortex and hippocampus of the prematurely aged rats than in normally aging control rats. The DNA damage 8-OHdG is a product of ROS interaction with DNA. Numerous studies have shown that 8-OHdG increases in different mammalian organs with age (see DNA damage theory of aging).\n\nExposure of spermatozoa to oxidative stress is a major causative agent of male infertility. Sperm DNA fragmentation, caused by oxidative stress, appears to be an important factor in the etiology of male infertility. A high level of the oxidative DNA damage 8-OHdG is associated with abnormal spermatozoa and male infertility.\n\nROS are constantly generated and eliminated in the biological system and are required to drive regulatory pathways. Under normal physiological conditions, cells control ROS levels by balancing the generation of ROS with their elimination by scavenging system. But under oxidative stress conditions, excessive ROS can damage cellular proteins, lipids and DNA, leading to fatal lesions in cell that contribute to carcinogenesis.\n\nCancer cells exhibit greater ROS stress than normal cells do, partly due to oncogenic stimulation, increased metabolic activity and mitochondrial malfunction. ROS is a double-edged sword. On one hand, at low levels, ROS facilitates cancer cell survival since cell-cycle progression driven by growth factors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) require ROS for activation and chronic inflammation, a major mediator of cancer, is regulated by ROS. On the other hand, a high level of ROS can suppress tumor growth through the sustained activation of cell-cycle inhibitor and induction of cell death as well as senescence by damaging macromolecules. In fact, most of the chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells by augmenting ROS stress. The ability of cancer cells to distinguish between ROS as a survival or apoptotic signal is controlled by the dosage, duration, type, and site of ROS production. Modest levels of ROS are required for cancer cells to survive, whereas excessive levels kill them.\n\nMetabolic adaptation in tumours balances the cells' need for energy with equally important need for macromolecular building blocks and tighter control of redox balance. As a result, production of NADPH is greatly enhanced, which functions as a cofactor to provide reducing power in many enzymatic reactions for macromolecular biosynthesis and at the same time rescuing the cells from excessive ROS produced during rapid proliferation. Cells counterbalance the detrimental effects of ROS by producing antioxidant molecules, such as reduced glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (TRX), which rely on the reducing power of NADPH to maintain their activities.\n\nMost risk factors associated with cancer interact with cells through the generation of ROS. ROS then activate various transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), leading to expression of proteins that control inflammation; cellular transformation; tumor cell survival; tumor cell proliferation; and invasion, agiogenesis as well as metastasis. And ROS also control the expression of various tumor suppressor genes such as p53, retinoblastoma gene (Rb), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).\n\nROS-related oxidation of DNA is one of the main causes of mutations, which can produce several types of DNA damage, including non-bulky (8-oxoguanine and formamidopyrimidine) and bulky (cyclopurine and etheno adducts) base modifications, abasic sites, non-conventional single-strand breaks, protein-DNA adducts, and intra/interstrand DNA crosslinks. It has been estimated that endogenous ROS produced via normal cell metabolism modify approximately 20,000 bases of DNA per day in a single cell. 8-oxoguanine is the most abundant among various oxidized nitrogeneous bases observed. During DNA replication, DNA polymerase mispairs 8-oxoguanine with adenine, leading to a G→T transversion mutation. The resulting genomic instability directly contributes to carcinogenesis. Cellular transformation leads to cancer and interaction of atypical PKC-ζ isoform with p47phox controls ROS production and transformation from apoptotic cancer stem cells through blebbishield emergency program.\n\nUncontrolled proliferation is a hallmark of cancer cells. Both exogenous and endogenous ROS have been shown to enhance proliferation of cancer cells. The role of ROS in promoting tumor proliferation is further supported by the observation that agents with potential to inhibit ROS generation can also inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Although ROS can promote tumor cell proliferation, a great increase in ROS has been associated with reduced cancer cell proliferation by induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest; increased phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk 1), Chk 2; and reduced cell division cycle 25 homolog c (CDC25).\n\nA cancer cell can die in three ways: apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Excessive ROS can induce apoptosis through both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. In the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, ROS are generated by Fas ligand as an upstream event for Fas activation via phosphorylation, which is necessary for subsequent recruitment of Fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase 8 as well as apoptosis induction. In the intrinsic pathway, ROS function to facilitate cytochrome c release by activating pore-stabilizing proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) as well as inhibiting pore-destabilizing proteins (Bcl-2-associated X protein, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer). The intrinsic pathway is also known as the caspase cascade and is induced through mitochondrial damage which triggers the release of cytochrome c. DNA damage, oxidative stress, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential lead to the release of the pro-apoptotic proteins mentioned above stimulating apoptosis. Mitochondrial damage is closely linked to apoptosis and since mitochondria are easily targeted there is potential for cancer therapy.\n\nThe cytotoxic nature of ROS is a driving force behind apoptosis, but in even higher amounts, ROS can result in both apoptosis and necrosis, a form of uncontrolled cell death, in cancer cells.\n\nNumerous studies have shown the pathways and associations between ROS levels and apoptosis, but a newer line of study has connected ROS levels and autophagy. ROS can also induce cell death through autophagy, which is a self-catabolic process involving sequestration of cytoplasmic contents (exhausted or damaged organelles and protein aggregates) for degradation in lysosomes. Therefore, autophagy can also regulate the cell’s health in times of oxidative stress. Autophagy can be induced by ROS levels through many different pathways in the cell in an attempt to dispose of harmful organelles and prevent damage, such as carcinogens, without inducing apoptosis. Autophagic cell death can be prompted by the over expression of autophagy where the cell digests too much of itself in an attempt to minimize the damage and can no longer survive. When this type of cell death occurs, an increase or loss of control of autophagy regulating genes is commonly co-observed. Thus, once a more in-depth understanding of autophagic cell death is attained and its relation to ROS, this form of programmed cell death may serve as a future cancer therapy.\nAutophagy and apoptosis are two different cell death mechanisms brought on by high levels of ROS in the cells, however; autophagy and apoptosis rarely act through strictly independent pathways. There is a clear connection between ROS and autophagy and a correlation seen between excessive amounts of ROS leading to apoptosis. The depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane is also characteristic of the initiation of autophagy. When mitochondria are damaged and begin to release ROS, autophagy is initiated to dispose of the damaging organelle. If a drug targets mitochondria and creates ROS, autophagy may dispose of so many mitochondria and other damaged organelles that the cell is no longer viable. The extensive amount of ROS and mitochondrial damage may also signal for apoptosis. The balance of autophagy within the cell and the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis mediated by ROS is crucial for a cell’s survival. This crosstalk and connection between autophagy and apoptosis could be a mechanism targeted by cancer therapies or used in combination therapies for highly resistant cancers.\n\nAfter growth factor stimulation of RTKs, ROS can trigger activation of signaling pathways involved in cell migration and invasion such as members of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family – extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun NH-2 terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. ROS can also promote migration by augmenting phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) p130Cas and paxilin.\n\nBoth in vitro and in vivo, ROS have been shown to induce transcription factors and modulate signaling molecules involved in angiogenesis (MMP, VEGF) and metastasis (upregulation of AP-1, CXCR4, AKT and downregulation of PTEN).\n\nExperimental and epidemiologic research over the past several years has indicated close associations among ROS, chronic inflammation, and cancer. ROS induces chronic inflammation by the induction of COX-2, inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6), chemokines (IL-8, CXCR4) and pro-inflammatory transcription factors (NF-κB). These chemokines and chemokine receptors, in turn, promote invasion and metastasis of various tumor types.\n\nBoth ROS-elevating and ROS-eliminating strategies have been developed with the former being predominantly used. Cancer cells with elevated ROS levels depend heavily on the antioxidant defense system. ROS-elevating drugs further increase cellular ROS stress level, either by direct ROS-generation (e.g. motexafin gadolinium, elesclomol) or by agents that abrogate the inherent antioxidant system such as SOD inhibitor (e.g. ATN-224, 2-methoxyestradiol) and GSH inhibitor (e.g. PEITC, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)). The result is an overall increase in endogenous ROS, which when above a cellular tolerability threshold, may induce cell death. On the other hand, normal cells appear to have, under lower basal stress and reserve, a higher capacity to cope with additional ROS-generating insults than cancer cells do. Therefore, the elevation of ROS in all cells can be used to achieve the selective killing of cancer cells.\n\nRadiotherapy also relies on ROS toxicity to eradicate tumor cells. Radiotherapy uses X-rays, γ-rays as well as heavy particle radiation such as protons and neutrons to induce ROS-mediated cell death and mitotic failure.\n\nDue to the dual role of ROS, both prooxidant and antioxidant-based anticancer agents have been developed. However, modulation of ROS signaling alone seems not to be an ideal approach due to adaptation of cancer cells to ROS stress, redundant pathways for supporting cancer growth and toxicity from ROS-generating anticancer drugs. Combinations of ROS-generating drugs with pharmaceuticals that can break the redox adaptation could be a better strategy for enhancing cancer cell cytotoxicity.\n\nJames Watson and others have proposed that lack of intracellular ROS due to a lack of physical exercise may contribute to the malignant progression of cancer, because spikes of ROS are needed to correctly fold proteins in the endoplasmatic reticulum and low ROS levels may thus aspecifically hamper the formation of tumor suppressor proteins. Since physical exercise induces temporary spikes of ROS, this may explain why physical exercise is beneficial for cancer patient prognosis. Moreover, high inducers of ROS such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose and carbohydrate-based inducers of cellular stress induce cancer cell death more potently because they exploit cancer cell high avidity for sugars.\n\n"}

Lowery Sr. (December 29, 1938 – July 29, 2018) was an American politician who was a mayor of the city of Florissant in northern St. Louis County, Missouri from 2001 to 2011. Before becoming mayor, Lowery served as a police officer and the police chief of Florissant and has served the citizens of Florissant in various capacities for nearly 50 years. He has stated that \"I truly, truly love Florissant\".\nUpon the death of Mayor James J. Eagan in November 2000 Council President John Moran was Mayor pro tempore and the successor to the position of mayor. \n\nLowery was elected Mayor on February 6, 2001 in a special election to fill the unexpired term of James Eagan. The election had a turn out of 32% of 32,467 registered voters, with Lowery winning the election with 7,057 votes, 68% of the votes cast.\n\nLowery was a police officer in the city of Florissant for 41 years. During this time he served as police chief for 22 years from 1979 until he was elected mayor in 2001. Lowery was elected to the Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission and headed up the St. Louis County Police Department's Major Case Squad for 20 years. In 1999 a thief stole police chief Lowery's gun and holster while he was trying on pants at St. Louis Centre.\nThroughout his career as police chief Florissant was consistently ranked as one of the safest cities in America.\n\nWhen elected mayor, Lowery selected Stephen Kruse to become his replacement as police chief. Kruse then resigned to accept a new position working in the private sector. On November 1, 2002, Lowery officially appointed William Karabas to be the city's police chief.\n\nIn November 2000 the Mayor of Florissant, James J. Egan, died from medical complications. A special election to fill the unexpired term of Mayor was held on February 6, 2001. Lowery, David L. Reynolds, and Glen W. Lindemann ran. 10,435 voters showed up on election day giving the majority (7,057) to Lowery.\n\nIn the election of 2003 Lowery ran unopposed.\n\nIn the election of 2007 Lowery ran against Andrew G. Podleski, winning by a margin of 1162 votes.\n\nAfter taking office, Lowery led the way to many new renovations in the City of Florissant.\n\nThe first of these changes came in 2002, in the part of Florissant near Lindbergh Boulevard and New Halls Ferry Road known as Cross Keys. The area had formerly been a small shopping mall with only a few tenants left. The tenants that remain included a supermarket, a pharmacy, and a fashion store, all of which are still located near the area where the new shopping center replacing the mall that once stood their. Adding to the shopping center were several new restaurants and shops including a bookstore. This had been in the Eagan Florissant city plan prior to Lowery taking office. \n\nLowery's improvements are not limited to the Cross Keys neighborhood. A new bicycling and walking path that extends from the Sunset Park along the Missouri River to St. Ferdinand Park was recently completed in 2006. The path, most of which runs along the same path a some high voltage powerlines, connects much of western Florissant with the main section of Florissant via a foot bridge for pedestrians and cyclists. Much of the city is divided by Coldwater Creek, which has some natural and man-made tributaries that separate various neighborhoods from Berkeley, Hazelwood, Florissant, Black Jack, until pouring into the Missouri River in unincorporated St. Louis County. A similar footbridge plan was slated to connect the Wedgewood subdivision to a footpath leading to St. Ferdinand Park's east entrance, but because of strong opposition by residents in the neighborhood, this plan never became possible. \n\nThough the commercial redevelopment of Cross Keys is a success, much of the city's other commercial areas are still in need of the same renovation, especially the Florissant Meadows section of town near the city's historic Old Town area.\n\nLowery has been fearful of his security since taking office. He has said that \"every city has people who are really on the edge. We have 25 or 30 who are convinced that everything bad that's happening to them is the government's fault. And the closest government to them is City Hall.\" To quell his fears, Lowery has had security cameras installed at City Hall and is considering adding metal detectors to the entrances. Lowery has also had an increased police prescience in city council meetings and has also installed metal detectors for security screening of attendees. \n\nIn addition during Lowery's term the city has purchased surveillance cameras to be deployed throughout the city, despite some citizens concerns about privacy issues.\n\nLowery has come under some controversy during his mayorship.\n\nAccording to a \"Wall Street Journal\" article published on August 3, 2005, a development firm turned down a $30 million project to construct condominiums, lofts, and retail space when the owner of a piece of vacant land refused to sell. According to city officials, the developer did not want the negative publicity due to the controversy of eminent domain and eminent domain abuse. The company defended their pull-out stating poor soil conditions and flooding in addition to eminent domain issues were to blame.\n\nLowery commented \"The company did not want the adverse publicity. People don't understand what eminent domain is. They think it's always taking grandma out of her house, and that's not true. I wouldn't touch anything like that. That's political disaster.\"\n\nThe developers had plans on building in Florissant's Old Town historic district, where many building are registered as historic buildings. The idea of putting an upscale development project certainly would not have been a suitable area. However, the project might have been ideal for areas such as the east side of the city where many buildings and businesses have become run down or closed.\n\nWhile Mayor Lowery and former Florissant city coucilwoman Geri Debo pushed to promote the Old Town Florissant area as an Old St. Charles type area to potential businesses, the area did attract a few new stores, but the promised increased foot traffic did not come to fruition and those businesses closed and had problems selling their property.\n\nAnother controversy that Lowery has tried to keep quiet about is his support for his son, Robert Lowery Jr.\n\nRobert Lowery Jr. served as the city administrator for the city of O'Fallon, Missouri in nearby St. Charles County, Missouri. Since taking office, the elder Lowery has quietly supported his son on various issues including the annexation of August A. Busch Memorial Conservation Area in nearby Weldon Springs, Missouri. While the younger Lowery stated that the annexation was an attempt to be viewed as a \"good neighbor.\" But a local government watchdog group as well as a few other city officials determined the plan to be a case of backdoor politics. As a fifth ward, the wildlife preserve owned by Adolphus Busch IV and maintained by the Missouri Department of Conservation would have allowed developers to move in and whittle away the property for urban sprawl. Lowery argued that if the city did not annex the land, another nearby town would.\n\nOn June 14, 2007, the O'Fallon city council unanimously opposed the annexation for now. Attending the meeting was Mr. Busch.\n\nMany people in O'Fallon, St. Charles County, as well as patrons of Busch Wildlife and an independent watchdog group would like to see Lowery step down not only for the Busch Wildlife incident but other instance of corruption within the O'Fallon government.\n\nOn June 24, 2009 the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported that Lowery Jr. has tendered his resignation as O'Fallon City Administrator.\n\n\nLinks related to Bob Lowery Jr.\n"}

{"id": "4413521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4413521", "title": "Samuel T. Anders", "text": "Samuel T. Anders\n\nSamuel T. Anders (callsign \"Longshot\") is a fictional character from the re-imagined \"Battlestar Galactica\" television series, played by Michael Trucco. He first appeared as a recurring character in the second-season episode \"Resistance\", but assumed a pivotal role in the series by the end.\n\nAlthough not revealed until the final season of the show, Anders is approximately two thousand years old, and was born as a member of the ill-fated Thirteenth Tribe, a group consisting entirely of Cylons who left Kobol and settled on the first Earth. Along with fellow Cylons Saul Tigh, Ellen Tigh, Galen Tyrol and Tory Foster, Anders worked as part of a research group on Resurrection technology. They were warned about a coming disaster by people no one else could see. The messenger that appeared to Anders looked like a woman. When their Earth was destroyed, the five Cylons were resurrected on a subluminal ship in orbit, and traveled to the Twelve Colonies at sub-lightspeed, stopping at the temple of the five on algae planet and arriving at the time of the First Cylon War. Seeking to end the conflict, the five Earth Cylons presented the Colonial Cylon forces with a deal — if the warring Centurions called off the war, the five would teach them to create humanoid Cylon models, and give them Resurrection technology.\n\nThe Centurions agreed, and departed from Colonial space along with Anders and his cohorts, but their efforts ultimately backfired. The first humanoid Cylon created, John Cavil, also known simply as Number One, was incensed that he had been created with so many human weaknesses, and turned on his creators. He killed them, arranging it that they would be resurrected with no memory of who they really were, and carefully inserted them into Colonial society with false memories in order to give them a plausible background-cover.\n\nExactly when Anders arrived on Caprica is unrevealed, but he became involved in the popular Colonial sport of Pyramid, becoming a star player for the Caprica Buccaneers.\n\nWhen the Cylon attack on the Colonies came, Anders and his team were undergoing high altitude training in the mountains and thus escaped the initial devastation. Anders muttered that \"this has all happened before.\" Rounding up other survivors, supplies and weapons, the team, with Anders as their leader, became the nucleus of a functioning resistance group against the Cylon occupation, operating from a wilderness base in the vicinity of the city of Delphi. Everyone looked to Anders for leadership including the coach and he wasn't aware that he ended up with two Cylons in his resistance movement: a Simon (who he found out about when he rescued Starbuck) and a Cavil who grew sympathetic towards humanity due to his time in the Resistance. It was in the area of their base that they encountered Lieutenant Kara Thrace (Starbuck) and Karl Agathon (Helo) during the events of the episode \"Resistance\" after Thrace returned to Caprica to retrieve the Arrow of Apollo on the orders of President Laura Roslin. Anders and his team ambushed them after being told by Cavil that they might be Cylons.\n\nThrace and Anders swiftly form a relationship and, when she has to return to the Fleet, she promises him that she will return to Caprica and rescue his group. She secures this promise by giving Anders her fleet dogtags. However, President Roslin and Commander Adama deny Starbuck's request to lead a search and rescue mission back to Caprica, stating the situation is too dangerous. Meanwhile, Anders's team struggle to survive and continue their attacks on the Cylons.\n\nIn the episode \"Downloaded\", during a sabotage mission, Anders is caught in the rubble of a parking structure where he encounters the Cylons Caprica Six, Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii along with a Number Three copy. The Three attempts to kill Anders, but Caprica Six and Valerii (Number Eight), having decided to sympathize with the human cause, turn against Three and allow Anders to escape.\n\nDuring the episodes \"Lay Down Your Burdens\", Parts I and II, Thrace is finally given the go-ahead to lead a group of Raptors to Caprica and gather the survivors. Once found, Anders's team comes under attack by Cylon Centurions who discover their encampment and drive them out, forcing the heavily outnumbered resistance group deep into the wilderness where they take cover in a ravine. After an unsettling 18-hour standoff, the team discovers the Cylons have completely withdrawn from the area. A mysterious survivor among the group (later discovered to be a copy of the Cylon John Cavil), announces the Cylons have left the planet.\n\nOnce at the fleet, Anders and Thrace begin a proper relationship which causes torn feelings for Lee Adama. During the year that passes after settling on New Caprica, Thrace and Anders marry and the two live in a tent in the ramshackle \"New Caprica City\" under the neglectful authority of President Gaius Baltar. Anders becomes seriously ill with pneumonia at one point, but makes a full recovery. After the Cylons invade New Caprica at the end of the second season, and Starbuck is taken into custody by the Cylon Leoben Conoy, Anders once again finds himself as one of the leaders of the resistance against a Cylon occupation as seen at the beginning of the third season.\n\nFollowing the escape from New Caprica, the episode \"Collaborators\" sees Anders becoming one of the six members of the Circle, a Star Chamber like group commissioned by the newly sworn in President Tom Zarek to try, judge, and execute Cylon collaborators. After thirteen such executions, Anders quits The Circle, having lost his taste for revenge, and is immediately replaced by his wife as a new member. Anders and Thrace subsequently quarrel, which exposes numerous deep rifts that had emerged in their marriage and the two separate.\n\nMidway through the series’ third season, Anders and Thrace try to reconcile their marriage, but Thrace's growing love for Lee Adama makes things difficult.\n\nIn the episode \"Maelstrom\", Anders asks her to go with him to another ship for some much needed rest and relaxation to which she replies she would think about it. He leaves the room and the two never fully resolve their soured relationship. After Starbuck's apparent death in the same episode, Anders starts to drink heavily. In mourning, he finds himself in a drunken state atop one of the Colonial Vipers in the hangar. Lee Adama tries to talk him down, but Anders slips and falls, breaking his leg.\n\nIn the episode \"Crossroads, Part I\", Anders is seen wearing the uniform of a Colonial Fleet Ensign, having signed up for flight training since Thrace’s death. He also shows the beginnings of a relationship with Diana Seelix, another new pilot recruited from among Galactica’s deck crew.\n\nAs the trial of Gaius Baltar commences, Anders, along with his fellow hidden Cylons, Foster, Tyrol and Saul Tigh, begins to hear strange music coming from a radio in Joe's Bar. Anders and Foster sleep together at this time. In the season 3 finale, \"Crossroads, Part II\", the four become aware of the fact they are Cylons based on hallucinatory music (which turns out to be \"All Along The Watchtower\" as arranged by Bear McCreary and performed by Bt4) only they can hear, and an apparent mental \"switch\" that goes off within them. Initially appalled by the discovery, after Saul Tigh declares his loyalty to the Fleet, regardless of who he might be, Anders follows his lead and reports for duty to prepare for battle against the Cylon fleet.\n\nIn the first episode of the fourth season, \"He That Believeth In Me\", Anders flies his first battle mission and cannot fire upon his targeted Cylon ship due to the weapons being jammed. The Cylon pilot recognizes him as a Cylon, and the Cylon fighters retreat to their baseships and jump away. After being reunited with the newly returned Thrace, who is thought by many to be a Cylon, Anders tells her he will still love her even if she is. Kara replies if he were a Cylon, she would kill him with no qualms. He and the other three secret Cylons meet in secret and he is later assigned as a member of Thrace's crew on the \"Demetrius\", on a secret mission to find Earth.\n\nWhile aboard the \"Demetrius\", Anders tries to reconnect with his wife and constantly reassure the rest of the crew of the ship who are lacking confidence in Thrace's ability and purpose (especially when she begins to take advice from the captured Cylon, Leoben Conoy). When the crew eventually mutiny against Thrace, Anders is one of the few who comes to his wife's aid even going so far as to shoot Felix Gaeta in the leg to prevent him jumping the \"Demetrius\" back to the human fleet against Thrace's wishes. Anders continues to show his loyalty to his wife by accompanying her to the damaged Cylon basestar and assisting her with her plans.\n\nThrace is shocked when it is revealed in \"Revelations\" that her husband is a Cylon, but near the end of the episode they are seen together in the corridor paying respect to a photo of deceased comrade Louanne Katraine. On the destroyed Earth, Anders finds the remains of a guitar and begins to subconsciously play the song \"All Along the Watchtower\" on it, and remembers he had once played the song for the woman he loved. He then realizes that he, along with the other members of the Final Five, had lived their past lives on Earth.\n\nDuring the mutiny led by Felix Gaeta and Tom Zarek, Anders is badly beaten and thrown into the brig with the other prisoners loyal to Admiral Adama. They are eventually freed by Thrace and Lee Adama. Anders is shot in the neck during their escape, and a tearful Kara Thrace refuses to leave his side. Romo Lampkin, encountering them in the corridor, helps Kara take her husband to Dr. Cottle.\n\nIn the episode \"No Exit\", Anders experiences a reawakening of his Cylon memories due to the brain damage caused by the wound. He frantically attempts to educate his fellow 'Final Five' crewmembers regarding their purpose and destiny, but eventually succumbs to his wounds. The bullet is removed, but he remains comatose. At the end of the following episode, \"Deadlock\", Anders begins to show brain activity. In \"Someone to Watch Over Me\", it is shown that Anders' brain activity is very unusual but not indicative of conscious thought. A Number Eight suggests linking him to the datastream aboard the Baseship might help.\n\nActing on the Eight's idea the Cylons immerse him in a Hybrid pool much like those on Cylon baseships and connect him to the datastream. Once connected, he begins mimicking the mannerisms of the baseship Hybrids, down to the incoherent (to casual observers) but prophetic ramblings. Thrace visits him and requests to be alone with him. Saying her goodbyes she attempts to kill him by gunshot to the head, but Anders, acting on reflex, catches and almost crushes Thrace's forearm, telling her, just as another Basestar Hybrid did, that she is the Harbinger of Death. As he does so power fluctuations, which have been going on for sometime on \"Galactica\" grow much worse, including surging power levels of the main engines. Anders releases Thrace and the power fluctuations subside but do not end\n\nIt is determined Anders is directly (though inadvertently) interacting with \"Galactica's\" power grid (but not the firewalled computers) via the Cylon organic resin applied to her superstructure for repair purposes. It is theoretically possible for Anders to jump the ship on his own just like a Hybrid on a Baseship; in effect, Anders has become \"Galactica's\" own Hybrid. Disturbed by this development, Colonel Tigh orders that Anders be disconnected. Removed from the datastream, Anders reverts to his comatose state.\n\nLater, in the episode \"Islanded in a Stream of Stars\", Thrace once again visits her husband, because she believes there is a pattern in a drawing given to her by Hera Agathon, which turned out to be a representation of musical notes for a song Thrace's father played for her as a child. She is determined to get answers from Anders and reconnects him to talk to him. When he is plugged back in, the power surges briefly return but then subside as Samuel Anders vocalizes the line of code \"New command\". By this point, Thrace has apparently accepted the permanence of Anders’ condition.\n\nDuring the final episodes of the series, \"Daybreak\", Anders plays a pivotal role in the Battle of the Colony, as, acting in the role of \"Galactica's\" Hybrid, he is able to remotely access the Cylon colony's Hybrids and take both them and the weapons that they control offline, preventing \"Galactica's\" destruction. Despite his state, he is able to share his memories during the attempt to recreate resurrection by the other members of the Final Five connecting to the datastream in his tank.\n\nOnce the fleet finally arrives at the new Earth, the decision is made for Anders to pilot \"Galactica\" and the rest of the fleet into the sun, leaving humanity to resettle on the planet below with minimal technology. When Kara leaves after saying her final goodbyes to Sam, Anders quietly responds, “see you on the other side”. With the last of the crew on Earth, Anders pilots the fleet into the sun.\n\nDespite his fame, Anders cared little for the glamorous aspects of his life as a Pyramid star, instead revealing in an interview that he took pleasure in the subtler aspects of the game, the joys of creating an impressive play, relating the sport to more mathematical concepts of physics and precision. Although highly successful at the game, he revealed that winning championships was of comparatively little interest to him compared to these more nebulous aspects.\n\nAs a resistance leader, Anders showed a talent for organization and a good tactical ability, mounting a number of highly successful strikes, even some deep inside Cylon occupied cities. He understandably carried a deep hatred for the Cylons, but also had a pragmatic attitude, such as his willingness to accept that the Number Eight copy who had been traveling with Karl Agathon was on their side. After the escape from New Caprica, Sam joins a tribunal that is kidnapping, trying, and executing those they deem to have collaborated with the Cylons. While Sam is at first willing to execute these collaborators, he quickly loses his taste for vengeance and resigns from the tribunal, as he no longer believes that they seek justice. When Kara later joins the tribunal, he views this as a personal betrayal.\n\nThroughout their tumultuous relationship, Anders showed a great deal of loyalty to his wife Kara Thrace, making frequent attempts to reconcile after their estrangement and, after her return from the dead, often being her strongest advocate. His loyalty to her only wavered during the two months where she was believed dead, when he appeared to be forming a relationship with Diana Seelix, something that he later apologized to Seelix for after Thrace’s return, and had at least 1 sexual encounter with Tory Foster.\n\n"}

In 2001, \"Seaman\" was re-released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 as Seaman: Kindan no Pet - Gaze Hakushi no Jikken Shima (シーマン~禁断のペット~ガゼー博士の実験島), the first edition of which came with a microphone. A PC version for Microsoft Windows was planned, with the Seaman being able to interact with the user's applications. No release date was specified, and it was later cancelled.\n\nA sequel called \"Seaman 2\" was released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 in 2007.\n\nAs a new pet owner, the player is given the responsibility of caring for and learning about the enigmatic \"Seaman\" species, using a replica of the discoverer's laboratory. The player must figure everything out by themselves, such as appropriate care, with some guidance from the narrator Leonard Nimoy as Himself.\n\nIn the game's manual, it contains the backstory about the seaman. During the 1930s, Dr. Jean Paul Gassé was a member of a special team of French biologists sent to Egypt by the French government. During that time, Dr. Gassé was determined to research a creature that was an \"omnipotent messenger of gods\" among the ruins of the Third Dynasty. In March 1932, in the city of Alexandria, Dr. Gassé met up a local resident, who, while fishing, caught a seaman. Dr. Gassé obtained a sample of some of the seaman eggs, and went back to France with the egg samples in his possession. \n\nWhen Dr. Gassé returned to France, he attempted to raise the eggs, but in the process, the seaman died. Shortly after this, he published a thesis of his work. Leading academics, however, dismissed him and his work as a PR stunt and without proper evidence to support these theories. As the result, the work was ignored, and no one believed him. His hypothesis suggested that the Seaman was responsible for transferring knowledge that increased during the Third Dynasty across oceans and other lands. This theory became the basis for Anthro-Bio Archaeology, which is a highly valued field of study.\n\nShortly after publishing his thesis, Dr. Gassé was fired from his post. After his dismissal, news of Gassé’s whereabouts and activities were unknown, and details during those times were sketchy. Rumors began circulating that Dr. Gassé's trail traced to some remote islands in Southeast Asia. It is known, however, that he escaped the horrors of World War II and met up with his colleague, Kimo Masuda. It became clear that sometime during these years they were able to conduct further research on Seaman's evolution, quite possibly even up to the creature walking on all fours. Unfortunately, there was very little hard data or evidence that substantiated these findings.\n\nIn March 1996, the French Government established the Anthro-Bio Archeological Research Institute (ABARI), headquartered in Paris. The institute is based on the work of Dr. Gassé, and most of the modern day research of Seaman specimens has taken place there. In 1997, the ABARI announced there was a strong possibility that these Seaman species were closely related to the origins of ancient civilizations in Egypt. On October 6, 1998, one of Gassé’s formaldehyde specimens is discovered at the University of Paris.\n\nOn February 15, 1999, parts of Gassé's journal and note entries were found in the Masuda family storehouse in Matsuzaka City in Mie Prefecture, Japan. Professor Kendare Takahashi, who was directing the Japanese branch of the ABARI, successfully managed to breed Seaman eggs in captivity, in July the same year. Soon after, Seaman was presented in aquariums across Japan. In July 2000, an expedition team embarked for Egypt in a first major research of the Seaman in the wild.\n\nThe \"Seaman\" is a form of freshwater fish (the color and shape of the fins suggest that it is a Carp) with a very lifelike human face. It possesses human mannerisms and behavior with which the player interacts.\n\"Seaman\" is considered a unique video game in that it presents limited action. The player's role is to feed and care for Seaman, while providing him with the company that he needs. In fact, the player is required to check on the Seaman every day of real time, or he could die. A portion of Seaman's knowledge is random trivia. When he asks what the player's birthday is (and the player responds via the microphone input), Seaman will then share significant events which happened on that date.\n\nThe Seaman becomes fairly domesticated, but this does not prevent it from insulting the player or constructing less-than-friendly remarks.\n\nThe player is provided with an unhatched Seaman egg at the beginning of the game and through various terms of development and conditions develops and interacts with it. By using various buttons on the Dreamcast controller, the player controls all of the machinery and physical contact with the mysterious creature. The player is also provided with multiple Seamen for breeding and interaction purposes. Over the course of the game, it is required of the player to evolve their Seaman to different stages in its life cycle, eventually transforming into a frog-like creature outlined on the Disc's cover.\n\nIn the Seaman's first days of life, it begins as a \"Mushroomer\", a form consisting of a well-developed optic organ and a flagellum, lacking a face or any verbal means of communication. In this form, it is essentially a parasite, which overruns a host Nautilus via being eaten and consumes it from the inside out for nourishment. Mushroomers tend to stick to one side of the tank by the ends of their flagellum if left alone. In this stage, the player's interaction is somewhat minimal and plays similar to a tutorial, allowing the player to learn to control the heat in the fish tank, direct the Mushroomers, and clean out any filthy water that has accumulated over time.\n\nAfter emerging from the deceased body of the Nautilus, the organism enters a stage called the \"Gillman\", which features a humanoid face and small, fish-like body. During this stage, the Seaman becomes capable of speech, copying and reiterating comments through a microphone input. At this stage, the player will begin the communication process and continue facilitating the aquarium as the Gillman grows larger, developing scales and a larger vocabulary. Although they begin small, the Gillmen soon kill one another until only two remain. Their genders are indeterminate, however. When they get to a certain point, you can name one of them, and it will change its color and gender.\n\nIn this stage, the Seaman is still fish-like in appearance and is similar to that of the Gillman but more developed. After mating, the male Podfish dies.\n\nThe aquarium is also transformed into a terrarium, being drained of most of the water and introducing land and oxygen to breathe, the female then lays eggs on the shore. Shortly after the deposit of the eggs, the female also dies, leaving the player with the hatching of a new evolutionary stage.\n\nInstead of the introduction of new \"Mushroomers\" like the player began the game with, the player is provided with a new form called \"Tadmen\", that look similar to matured tadpoles entering the frog stage. The Tadmen's diet consists of feeding upon their fellow siblings until the number is reduced to two. When this happens, the siblings will produce an egg, which will hatch into a Frogman.\n\nThis is the Seaman's final stage of its maturity process. It has now become an amphibious creature, with its humanoid face and a frog's body. Now able to co-exist between the habitats of water and dry land, the Frogman is now capable of powerful leaps and the consumption of insectoid organisms; however, like the real-world frog, the creature still requires the moisture of water to stay alive and the player is now provided with a sprinkler system to achieve this. It is also at this stage where the player releases the seaman into the wild. While anything concerning metamorphosis and reproduction are left to speculation while the Frogmen are in the wild, it can be assumed the Seaman will eventually lay Mushroomer eggs and start the cycle over.\n\nIn Japan, the Dreamcast version of \"Seaman\" sold 399,342 copies as of February 1, 2004, making it the third best-selling Dreamcast game in the region at the time. The PlayStation 2 version of the game sold 305,632 in Japan as of November 2, 2008.\n\n\"Famitsu\" rated the original Dreamcast version of the game 29/40, and scored the PlayStation 2 remake a 31/40. \"Seaman\" received an Excellence Award for Interactive Art at the 1999 Japan Media Arts Festival and received the Original Game Character of the Year award at GDC 2002. In 2008, \"Game Informer\" named the game one of the top ten weirdest of all time.\n\nThe Angry Video Game Nerd, a game critic who generally reviews only bad games, reviewed the game in 2015 with a positive impression, 16 years after it was released in Japan, praising the game's creativity and voice function, but also criticized its tedious gameplay and controls. He dedicated the episode in memory of the late Leonard Nimoy, who died earlier that year.\n\n\n"}

This conceptualistion of service quality has its origins in the expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm.\n\nA business with high service quality will meet or exceed customer expectations whilst remaining economically competitive. Evidence from empirical studies suggests that improved service quality increases profitability and long term economic competitiveness. Improvements to service quality may be achieved by improving operational processes; identifying problems quickly and systematically; establishing valid and reliable service performance measures and measuring customer satisfaction and other performance outcomes.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of business administration, service quality is an achievement in customer service. It reflects at each service encounter. Customers form service expectations from past experiences, word of mouth and marketing communications. In general, customers compare perceived service with expected service, and which if the former falls short of the latter the customers are disappointed.\n\nFor example, in the case of Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, wherein TAJ remaining the old world, luxury brand in the five-star category, the umbrella branding was diluting the image of the TAJ brand because although the different hotels such as \"Vivanta by Taj\"- the four star category, \"Gateway\" in the three star category and \"Ginger\" the two star economy brand, were positioned and categorised differently, customers still expected high quality of Taj.\n\nThe measurement of subjective aspects of customer service depends on the conformity of the expected benefit with the perceived result. This in turns depends upon the customer's expectation in terms of service, they might receive and the service provider's ability and talent to present this expected service. Successful companies add benefits to their offering that not only satisfy the customers but also surprise and delight them. Delighting customers is a matter of exceeding their expectations. \nPre-defined objective criteria may be unattainable in practice, in which case, the best possible achievable result becomes the ideal. The objective ideal may still be poor, in subjective terms.\n\nService quality can be related to service potential (for example, worker's qualifications); service process (for example, the quickness of service) and service result (customer satisfaction).\n\nIndividual service quality states the service quality of employees as distinct from the quality that the customers perceived\n\nHistorically, scholars have treated service quality as very difficult to define and measure, due to the inherent intangible nature of services, which are often experienced subjectively.\n\nOne of the earliest attempts to grapple with the service quality concept came from the so-called \"Nordic School\". In this approach, service quality was seen as having two basic dimensions:\n\nThe technical quality is relatively objective and therefore easy to measure. However, difficulties arise when trying to evaluate functional quality.\n\nA customer's expectation of a particular service is determined by factors such as recommendations, personal needs and past experiences. The expected service and the perceived service sometimes may not be equal, thus leaving a gap. The service quality model or the ‘GAP model’ developed in 1985, highlights the main requirements for delivering high service quality. It identifies five ‘gaps’ that cause unsuccessful delivery. Customers generally have a tendency to compare the service they 'experience' with the service they 'expect'. If the experience does not match the expectation, there arises a gap. Given the emphasis on expectations, this approach to measuring service quality is known as the \"expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm\" and is the dominant model in the consumer behaviour and marketing literature. \n\nA model of service quality, based on the expectancy-disconformation paradigm, and developed by A. Parasuraman, Valarie A. Zeithaml and Len Berry, identifies the principal dimensions (or components) of service quality and proposes a scale for measuring service quality, known as SERVQUAL. The model's developers originally identified ten dimensions of service quality that influence customer's perceptions of service quality. However, after extensive testing and retesting, some of the dimensions were found to be autocorrelated and the total number of dimensions was reduced to five, namely - reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness. These five dimensions are thought to represent the dimensions of service quality across a range of industries and settings. Among students of marketing, the mnemonic, RATER, an acronym formed from the first letter of each of the five dimensions, is often used as an aid to recall.\n\nIn spite of the dominance of the expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm, scholars have questioned its validity. In particular scholars have pointed out the expetancy-disconfirmation approach had its roots in consumer research and was fundamentally concerned with measuring customer satisfaction rather than service quality. In other words, questions surround the \"face validity\" of the model and whether service quality can be conceptualised as a \"gap\".\n\nMeasuring service quality may involve both subjective and objective processes. In both cases, it is often some aspect of customer satisfaction which is being assessed. However, customer satisfaction is an indirect measure of service quality.\n\nGiven the widespread use of internet and e-commerce, researchers have also sought to define and measure e-service quality. Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Malhotra (2005, p. 5) define e-service quality as the “extent to which a website facilitates efficient and effective shopping, purchasing, and delivery.” Wolfinbarger and Gilly (2003, p. 183) define e-service quality as “the beginning to the end of the transaction including information search, website navigation, order, customer service interactions, delivery, and satisfaction with the ordered product.”.\n\nA recent paper examined research on e-service quality. The author identified four dimensions of e-service quality: website design, fulfillment, customer service, and security and privacy.\n\nSubjective processes can be assessed in characteristics (assessed be the SERVQUAL method); in incidents (assessed in Critical Incident Theory) and in problems (assessed by \"Frequenz Relevanz Analyse\" a German term. The most important and most used method with which to measure subjective elements of service quality is the Servqual method.\n\nObjective processes may be subdivided into primary processes and secondary processes. During primary processes, silent customers create test episodes of service or the service episodes of normal customers are observed. In secondary processes, quantifiable factors such as numbers of customer complaints or numbers of returned goods are analysed in order to make inferences about service quality.\n\nIn general, an improvement in service design and delivery helps achieve higher levels of service quality. For example, in service design, changes can be brought about in the design of service products and facilities. On the other hand, in service delivery, changes can be brought about in the service delivery processes, the environment in which the service delivery takes place and improvements in the interaction processes between customers and service providers.\n\nVarious techniques can be used to make changes such as: Quality function deployment (QFD); failsafing; moving the line of visibility and the line of accessibility; and blueprinting.\n\nIn order to ensure and increase the 'conformance quality' of services, that is, service delivery happening as designed, various methods are available. Some of these include Guaranteeing; Mystery Shopping; Recovering; Setting standards and measuring; Statistical process control and Customer involvement.\n\nThe relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction has received considerable attention in academic literature. The results of most research studies have indicated that the service quality and customer satisfaction are indeed independent but are closely related that and a rise in one is likely to result in an increase in another construct.\n\n"}
{"id": "329878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=329878", "title": "Steve Marriott", "text": "Steve Marriott\n\nStephen Peter Marriott (30 January 1947 – 20 April 1991) was an English musician, songwriter and frontman of two notable rock and roll bands, spanning over two decades. Marriott is remembered for his powerful singing voice which belied his small stature, and for his aggressive approach as a guitarist in mod rock bands Small Faces (1965–1969 and 1977–1978) and Humble Pie (1969–1975 and 1980–1981). Marriott was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Small Faces.\n\nIn Britain, Marriott became a popular, often-photographed mod style icon through his role as lead singer and guitarist with the Small Faces in the mid to late 1960s. Marriott was influenced from an early age by his heroes including Buddy Holly, Booker T & the MG's, Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Muddy Waters and Bobby Bland.\nIn later life Marriott became disillusioned with the music industry and turned his back on the big record companies, remaining in relative obscurity. He returned to his music roots playing the pubs and clubs around London and Essex.\n\nMarriott died on 20 April 1991 when a fire, which was thought to have been caused by a cigarette, swept through his 16th century home in Arkesden, Essex. He posthumously received an Ivor Novello Award in 1996 for his Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and was listed in \"Mojo\" as one of the top 100 greatest singers of all time.\n\nBlack Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne named Marriott the fourth greatest singer and Clem Burke of Blondie named him the sixteenth greatest singer. Paul Stanley of Kiss has said, \"He had a great voice\" and went on to say, \"Steve Marriott was unbelievable\". Keith Richards listed Marriott as one of his five favourite artists of all time. Steve Perry of Journey has said that, \"One of my favourite vocalists was Steve Marriott.\"\n\nSteve Marriott was born on 30 January 1947 at East Ham Memorial Hospital, Plashet, East Ham, (London, E7), England to parents Kay and Bill Marriott who lived at Strone Road, Manor Park. Born three weeks premature and weighing just , he developed jaundice and was kept in hospital four weeks before being well enough to go home. Marriott came from a working-class background and attended Monega Junior School. His father Bill worked as a printer and later owned a jellied eels stall, called 'Bill's Eels', outside the Ruskin Arms hotel. For a short time he also sold pie and mash. \n\nKay worked at the Tate & Lyle factory in Silvertown. Bill was an accomplished pub pianist. Bill bought Marriott a ukulele and harmonica which Marriott taught himself to play. Marriott showed an early interest in singing and performing, busking at local bus-stops for extra pocket money and winning talent contests during the family's annual holiday to Jaywick Holiday camp near Clacton-on-Sea.\n\nIn 1959 at the age of twelve, Marriott formed his first band with school friends Nigel Chapin and Robin Andrews. They were called 'The Wheels', later the 'Coronation Kids', and finally 'Mississippi Five'. They later added Simon Simkins and Vic Dixon to their line-up. From a young age, Marriott was a huge fan of American singer Buddy Holly and would mimic his hero by wearing large-rimmed spectacles with the lenses removed. He wrote his first song, called \"Shelia My Dear\", after his aunt Shelia to whom he was close. Those who heard the song said it was played at a jaunty pace in the style of Buddy Holly and his bandmates also nicknamed him 'Buddy'.\n\nThey would play at the local coffee bars in East Ham and perform Saturday morning gigs at the Essoldo Cinema in Manor Park. Marriott was a cheeky, hyperactive child, according to his mother Kay, and well known by his neighbours in Strone Road for playing pranks and practical jokes. While he was a pupil at local Sandringham Secondary Modern School, Marriott was said to be responsible for deliberately starting a fire in a classroom, though he always denied this.\n\nIn 1960, Bill Marriott spotted an advertisement in a London newspaper for a new Artful Dodger replacement to appear in Lionel Bart's popular musical \"Oliver!\", based on the novel \"Oliver Twist\" by Charles Dickens, at the \"New Theatre\" (now called the Noël Coward Theatre) in London's West End, and without telling his son, applied for him to audition. At the age of thirteen, Marriott auditioned for the role. He sang two songs, \"Who's Sorry Now\" by Connie Francis, and \"Oh, Boy!\" by Buddy Holly. Bart was impressed with Marriott's vocal abilities and hired him. Marriott stayed with the show for twelve months, playing various boys' roles during that time, for which he was paid £8 a week. Marriott was also chosen to provide lead vocals for the Artful Dodger songs \"Consider Yourself\", \"Be Back Soon\", and \"I'd Do Anything\", which appear on the official album to the stage show, released by World Record Club and recorded at the famous Abbey Road Studios. In 1961 the Marriott family moved from Strone Road to a new council flat in Daines Close, Manor Park.\n\nFollowing Marriott's successful acting debut in \"Oliver!\", his family encouraged him to pursue an acting career. In 1961 he auditioned and was accepted as a student at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London. Because his family were unable to afford the private school fees, it was mutually agreed the fees would be deducted from acting work the school found him. After Marriott's enrolment at the Italia Conti Academy, he quickly gained acting roles, working consistently in film, television and radio, often typecast as the energetic Cockney child. Soon he lost interest in acting and turned his attention back to his first love, which was music. His parents were devastated and his decision to give up acting caused a family rift. As a result, he left the family home for a short period to stay with friends.\n\nIn 1963, Marriott wrote \"Imaginary Love\" and touted it around the big record labels in London. On the strength of \"Imaginary Love\", Marriott secured a Decca Records deal as a solo artist with Dick Reagan (also an agent for Cliff Richard). Marriott's first single was a song written by Kenny Lynch, \"Give Her My Regards\", with Marriott's self-penned song as the B-side. The single was released in July 1963 and was commercially unsuccessful. In the same year Marriott formed The Frantiks, who recorded a cover version of Cliff Richard's song \"Move It\" with ex-Shadows drummer Tony Meehan, who was brought in to help with production.\n\nDespite the single being hawked around the major record companies, no one was interested and the song was never released. The band then changed their name to The Moments, or Marriott and his Moments. They played support for artists such as The Nashville Teens, The Animals, Georgie Fame and John Mayall, playing venues such as the 100 Club in Soho, London, and the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond. The Moments gained a loyal following, and for a short time had their own fanzine, \"Beat '64\", started by Stuart Tuck and dedicated to 'Steve Marriott's Moments'. \n\nThey are noted as performing a total of 80 gigs in 1964. The group was asked to record a single for the American market, a cover version of The Kinks' UK hit song \"You Really Got Me\", released on the World Artists record label (1964). When their version of \"You Really Got Me\" failed to get attention, Marriott was dropped from the band, with members claiming he was too young to be a lead singer. According to Don Craine, frontman of London R&B band The Downliners Sect, Marriott applied to join the band as a replacement harmonica player. Craine did not invite him to audition because he knew Marriott wanted to be lead vocalist.\n\nBetween leaving the Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: \"He actually approached us (The Checkpoints) and said he needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was with us for a couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He seemed to me to be a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them.\"\n\nOn 28 July 1964, Marriott first saw his future Small Faces partners, Ronnie Lane and 16-year-old drummer Kenney Jones. They were all performing at the Albion in Rainham, with their bands. Lane and Marriott met again by chance in the J60 Music Bar, a music shop in High Street North, Manor Park, where Marriott was working after his recent departure from the Moments. Lane came in looking to purchase a bass guitar, and afterwards was invited to Marriott's home to listen to his extensive collection of rare American R&B import records. With their shared love of R&B the trio were soon firm friends.\n\nMarriott was invited by Lane and Jones to perform with \"the Outcasts\" (previously called \"the Pioneers\") at the band's regular gig the Earl of Derby in Bermondsey. The trio each ended up completely drunk and Marriott enthusiastically destroyed the piano he was playing, much to the amusement of Lane and Jones. The landlord sacked them and the band was finished. \n\nAccording to David Bowie on a 1999 episode of \"VH1 Storytellers\", in 1964 he and his good friend Marriott planned to form an R&B duo called 'David and Goliath'. Instead, Marriott, Lane and Jones decided to form their own band, with Steve bringing along his acquaintance, Jimmy Winston (Winston was later replaced by Ian McLagan). Marriott's friend Annabel, an ex-student from the Italia Conti, came up with the band's distinctive name after commenting that they all had \"small faces\"; the name stuck in part because they were all (apart from Winston) small (none being over 5 ft 6 in tall), and the term \"face\" in English mod culture was the name given to a well-known and respected mod. Small Faces were signed to Don Arden within six weeks of forming and quickly became a successful mod band highly regarded by the youth cult's followers when their debut single \"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\" hit the UK singles chart. \n\nLater, they were said to be one of many influences on the formation and musical style of British hard rock group Led Zeppelin. Marriott is reputed to have been Jimmy Page's benchmark when selecting a lead singer, and there are unmistakable stylistic and timbral similarities between the voices of Marriott and Robert Plant, Led Zeppelin's lead singer. Plant was a fan of Small Faces and a regular at their early gigs where he also ran small errands for them. Zeppelin's classic song \"Whole Lotta Love\" is a direct take of Marriott's version of the classic song \"You Need Lovin'\", originally written by Willie Dixon and recorded by American blues singer Muddy Waters. Small Faces would regularly perform \"You Need Lovin'\" in their live set, and the song also appears on their debut album \"Small Faces\", released by Decca in May 1966.\n\nHowever Marriott bore no animosity to Plant. He is quoted as shouting \"Go on my son!\" and wishing him luck when he first heard Plant's version on the radio. Arden paid the band a wage of £20 a week each, along with accounts in clothes shops in Carnaby Street. On Boxing Day, 1965, Arden arranged for them to move into a rented house, 22 Westmoreland Terrace, Pimlico. In his autobiography, McLagan describes the house as \"party central\", a place where the likes of Marianne Faithfull, Brian Epstein, Pete Townshend and other celebrities would hang out. Marriott was just 18 years old.\n\nMarriott wrote or co-wrote most of Small Faces' hit singles. In an interview in 1984, Marriott was asked what his best Small Faces songs were: \"I think 'All or Nothing', that I wrote, takes a lot of beating. To me, if there's a song that typifies that era, then that might be it. Words regardless, cos it's only a silly love song, but the actual feel and arrangement of the thing, and maybe 'Tin Soldier'\". In 1967, Marriott wrote the evocative rock-ballad \"Tin Soldier\" to woo model Jenny Rylance. They first met in 1966 and Marriott was immediately smitten, but Rylance was dating up-and-coming singer Rod Stewart and so the two became friends. She later broke up with Stewart and had a brief romantic liaison with Marriott, but much to his disappointment ended it to go back to Stewart. Rylance and Stewart later split for good after a rocky four-year relationship; when Marriott found out he pursued her relentlessly, leading him to write \"Tin Soldier\". The song was a hit for the band in 1967 and for Marriott a personal triumph. He and Rylance were married at Kensington Register Office, London, on 29 May 1968.\n\nMarriott had liaisons with many women and had four known children with four of them, including one of his three wives. His first wife was model Jenny Rylance (1968–1973). He met American air hostess, Pam Stephens in 1975 and their son Toby was born in 1976. They married after Toby was born. His third wife was Toni Poulton. They were married until Marriott's death in 1991. He also had three daughters. The first, Lesley, was conceived to fellow teen Sally Foulger before Marriott became famous. She was originally known as Sarah Lisa Foulger (born 9 June 1966). She was adopted out, but later found out who her father was and has been accepted by her siblings. The second was Tonya, with Canadian Terri Elias in 1984. His third daughter Mollie Mae was born in 1985 when Marriott was with his childhood friend Manon Piercey.\n\nLater Marriott moved into Beehive Cottage in Moreton, Essex, a property he had bought jointly with Ronnie Lane and wife Susan and where he established his \"Clear Sounds\" music studio. In 1967, after a dispute over unpaid royalties, relations between the Small Faces and Don Arden broke down and Arden sold them on to Andrew Loog Oldham, who owned the Immediate Records label. The band were much happier at Immediate, spending more time in the recording studio and far less time playing live, but they lost the dynamic live sound that had made them famous.\n\nAfter the success of the group's number one hit concept album \"Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake\" Marriott was keen for the group to evolve and wanted to bring in ex-Herd frontman Peter Frampton, but McLagan, Jones and Lane refused. Marriott started to feel the band had reached the end creatively and began to spend more time with Frampton and Greg Ridley. After rumours in the press about the band splitting up, which were always officially denied, Marriott quit the group, storming off stage during a disastrous live performance on New Year's Eve, 1968. In a 1984 interview with NME reporter Paolo Hewitt on the subject of leaving the band, Marriott said:\n\n\"You grow apart for Christsakes. You're talking about people living together from the ages of seventeen to twenty-two and that's a growing up part of your life and we got to hate each other, no doubt about it. We didn't speak to each other for fucking years. Maybe ten years.\" – Marriott \n\nFrampton claims that after Marriott's departure from the Small Faces, the remaining members, Lane, McLagan and Jones, turned up at his home and offered him Marriott's role in the band. (Ian McLagan vehemently denied this story).\n\n\"The following day after the Alexandra Palace gig (where Steve walked off), I was back home and I got a call from Ronnie Lane who said, 'Me, Kenney and Mac would like to come round and see you.' I thought, Hello, what's all this about? Anyway, they all came round to my horrible little flat in Earls Court and asked me to join the Small Faces. All I could say was it's a bit late now. Why couldn't you have asked me while we were in Paris? We'd all be in the same band together and Steve wouldn't have left.\" – Peter Frampton. \n\nShortly after leaving Small Faces, Marriott joined the newly formed rock band Humble Pie with Peter Frampton, drummer Jerry Shirley and bassist Greg Ridley. In the early years, Humble Pie allowed Marriott the artistic freedom he craved but was denied in Small Faces due, in part, to commercial pressures and individual differences. After extensive secret rehearsals at his Clear Sounds home recording studio, the band released on Immediate their debut album \"As Safe As Yesterday Is\", closely followed by the Marriott-penned debut single \"Natural Born Bugie\" (often mis-spelt \"Boogie\"), which peaked at No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart in the summer of 1969. Humble Pie almost disbanded after their first American tour when they returned to Britain and discovered that Immediate had gone into liquidation. They transferred to A&M Records and focused all their attention on the lucrative US market. Their new manager, Dee Anthony, had the band scrap its 'unplugged' set and crank the volume up.\n\nHumble Pie toured constantly over the next three years, completing nineteen tours in the US alone. The band's next album releases, \"Humble Pie\" and \"Rock On\", benefitted from their touring. Their live album \"Performance Rockin' the Fillmore\" (1971) became the band's most successful release to date. During these recordings, Marriott's strong vocal performances became the focal point of the band. Dee Anthony pushed Marriott to take more of the on-stage spotlight, something he had, up to then, been sharing with Frampton and Ridley. Marriott's new prominence is said to have resulted in Frampton's decision to leave the band. (Frampton was replaced by Clem Clempson.)\n\nSome close to Marriott, such as his wife and even Marriott himself, would say that his personality changed for the worse when he toured America. Eventually, possibly as a result of excessive alcohol and drug use, Marriott started showing signs of mild schizophrenia. He had regularly taken amphetamines (speed) and smoked cannabis in his days in the Moments and Small Faces, and in the latter half of the 1960s he also tried LSD. But by the time Humble Pie began to tour America regularly in the early 1970s, Marriott allegedly developed a destructive cocaine and alcohol addiction, which is thought to have been the cause of his marriage break-ups and to have contributed to his premature death in a house fire.\n\n\"He (Steve) became another person to cope with the pressures, he would say things like, \"Please tell me that you'll leave me if I go on tour again because if you say that I’ll have justification not to go, if I go and have to be that other person again I'll just go mad.\" This would be said in a moment of truth but the next day had changed his mind and he'd be up and off... He was married to his music and I didn't mind that especially in the early years when he would play me new songs on an acoustic guitar but what didn't make me happy was when he was in the home studio, out of his brain, trying to come up with the next album because he was being pressurised into it. He would just disappear into the studio for three or four days at a time. He never slept and there would be all sorts of strange people in there with him. It was a crazy business and even the nicest people get mixed up. All sorts of chemicals were presented to him and he became addicted to them in the end. It was drugs that destroyed our relationship. Before the home studio was built Beehive Cottage was our sanctuary, afterwards it just became his workplace.\" – Jenny Rylance \n\nRylance finally left Marriott in 1973. She said: \"The drugs and the drink I would tolerate no more. It broke my heart to leave Steve but it had to be done, I was ultimately the stronger\". Due to the break-up of his marriage and growing drug use, some band members said that Marriott at times became domineering, aggressive and intolerable to work with. Humble Pie disbanded in 1975, citing musical differences as the reason for the split. Financial mismanagement and widespread substance abuse within the band also played a part. In an interview in 2000 with John Hellier, Jerry Shirley said:\n\n\"We were all doing too many drugs, we'd lost sight of our business arrangements and no-one within the band had any control over money matters. But the main reason was that we were making bad records, it all came to a head in early 1975. The rot had set in so deep it was inevitable.\" – Jerry Shirley (Humble Pie).\nMarriott always believed Dee Anthony had syphoned off band earnings to promote his new project, Frampton and his album \"Frampton Comes Alive\". After Marriott's death, second wife Pam Stephens claimed in an interview that while they were making the \"Marriott\" solo album they were warned off accusing Anthony of any financial misdealings and received threatening phone calls. Anthony was alleged to have links with the Genovese crime family (among others). She also claimed that after Marriott confronted Anthony about the missing money, she and Marriott were summoned to a meeting at the Ravenite Social Club on Mulberry Street in New York's Little Italy district. Among those present were John Gotti, Frank Locascio and Paul Castellano, all members of the Gambino crime family. Marriott was informed that he would not be getting any money and was warned to drop the matter. Marriott took the threats seriously.\n\nMarriott released his first solo album, \"Marriott\", in 1976 and moved back to Britain. Stephens gave birth to their first child Toby on 20 February 1976, and they were married on 23 March 1977, at Chelsea Register Office in London.\nThe money from Humble Pie's farewell tour soon ran out, and Marriott was reduced to stealing vegetables from a field next to his home. He went on to form the Steve Marriott Allstars with ex-Pie bassist Greg Ridley, drummer Ian Wallace and ex-Heavy Metal Kids' guitarist Mickey Finn, and found a new manager, Laurie O'Leary. In the 1980s O'Leary asked Marriott to meet a friend of his, the infamous Ronnie Kray, who was incarcerated in Broadmoor Hospital for the murder of George Cornell. Marriott gave him a signed photo.\n\nAfter the departure of Mick Taylor in 1975 from the Rolling Stones, Marriott was considered as his replacement; however, Mick Jagger allegedly blocked the move after Marriott upstaged him during the audition. According to Ronnie Wood in his autobiography \"Ronnie\", Marriott was Richards' first choice to replace Mick Taylor.\n\nIn 1976 a court ruled that Arden still owed the Small Faces £12,000 in unpaid royalties. He agreed to pay in monthly instalments, but disappeared after making just one payment.\n\nDue to the success of re-released singles \"Itchycoo Park\" and \"Lazy Sunday\" in 1975 and 1976, McLagan, Jones and Marriott were persuaded to re-form Small Faces. Rick Wills took the place of Lane, who pulled out after just two rehearsals. Unknown to the others, Lane was suffering from multiple sclerosis. The band recorded two albums, \"Playmates\" and \"'78 in the Shade\", but the albums were both critical and commercial failures and they disbanded. Marriott did not make any money out of the venture. His earnings were used to extricate him from old binding management contracts. Due to financial problems, Marriott was forced to sell Beehive Cottage, which had been his home since 1968, and move to a small terraced house in Golders Green, London.\n\nLate in 1978, the Inland Revenue informed Marriott that he still owed £100,000 in back tax from his Humble Pie days; he thought manager Dee Anthony had made all the necessary payments. O'Leary, Marriott's manager, advised him to leave Britain or go to prison. He sold the house in Golders Green and moved to California. Marriott, Pam and son Toby were staying with friends in Santa Cruz and Marriott formed a new band called The Firm, with Jim Leverton and (most notably) former Mountain guitarist Leslie West. But after Leverton had to leave the US due to visa problems, and disputes over potential royalties, the band broke up. Marriott was by now completely broke and forced to collect empty glass bottles to redeem them for small change. According to Leslie West, Steve needed the money and accepted a lucrative offer to reform Humble Pie.\n\nIn 1980, Marriott contacted Jerry Shirley, who was living in New York City, to discuss a Humble Pie reunion. Shirley agreed and they recorded \"Fool for a Pretty Face\", which Marriott had written earlier. The new line-up included Anthony \"Sooty\" Jones, who was well respected among American east coast musicians, also vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench, former member of the Jeff Beck Group. The song proved good enough for them to secure a recording contract with Atco. In the UK their material was released by Jet Records, owned by ex-Small Faces manager Don Arden. \n\nThey recorded the heavy rock album \"On to Victory\" (1980), followed by \"Go for the Throat\" (1981), and both proved reasonably successful. They also toured America as part of the \"Rock 'N' Roll Marathon\" bill. In the latter half of 1981, Marriott was beset with personal problems. His marriage was almost over and after he broke his wrist in an accident and was hospitalised with a suspected burst ulcer, whilst opening for Judas Priest and the new Humble Pie line-up disintegrated.\n\nDuring a visit to Britain in 1981, Marriott became eager to see Ronnie Lane. By this time Lane had begun to use a wheelchair. After an emotional meeting, Marriott suggested they gig together. They got together with Jim Leverton, Mick Weaver, Dave Hynes, Zoot Money and Mel Collins to record an album called \"Majik Mijits\". The album features songs by Lane and Marriott, though none were co-written. Due to Lane's illness, they were unable to tour and promote the album.\n\n\"Steve and Ronnie went to America to see Clive Davis of Arista Records. They played him the tape. Clive Davis was tapping his foot and tapping his very expensive pen on his very expensive desk. He said \"Yeah, that's great man\". Steve said \"So you like the tape, Clive\". Steve then stopped the tape, ejected it and said \"WELL YOU CAN'T FUCKING HAVE IT!\" The story that Steve told me was that it would have meant touring and Ronnie just wasn't up to it. It would have meant pretty much carrying him everywhere, no tour, no album. That's why the Mijits never came out at that point in time. It's been gathering dust for ages\" – Jim Leverton. \n\nThe album was released nineteen years later. After the \"Majik Mijits\", Marriott went back to New York playing on the club circuit again. For the next year and a half, Marriott was on the road with Jim Leverton, Goldy McJohn and Fallon Williams. They played mostly Small Faces and Humble Pie material, touring non-stop for the next eighteen months. After the departure of McJohn, the trio changed the band's name to the Three Trojans. Despite attempts at reconciliation, Marriott's marriage finally came to an end when his wife found out that Marriott was expecting a child with Terry Elias, a Canadian girl he had met while they were separated.\n\nAccepting that his marriage was over, Marriott moved back to the UK. With no home and no money, he stayed in the spare bedroom of his sister Kay's house. Marriott formed Packet of Three, again playing the pub circuit. He insisted on being paid for each gig in cash as the Inland Revenue were still pursuing him for back taxes. In August 1984, Aura Records released \"Steve Marriott Live at Dingwalls 6.7.84\". Marriott contacted longtime friend Manon Piercey, and they quickly developed a close relationship and rented a house together. Piercey gave birth to daughter Mollie Mae on 3 May 1985. With Piercey's help, Marriott reduced his excessive drink and drug habits. His sister Kay said: \"Steve would say, I'm not drinking any more, and he'd stop, six weeks, two months, he was very strong willed; if he wanted to, he could\". In 1985 Marriott was still touring with Packet of Three playing Canada, America and Europe.\n\nDuring Live Aid in 1985, London-based Phoenix Modernist Society joined mod revival bands such as the Lambrettas and Purple Hearts, with 1960s stars such as Chris Farlowe and PP Arnold. Together they cut a version of \"All or Nothing\" for Band Aid Trust. Kenny Lynch persuaded Marriott to get involved, and the single was released under the collective name the Spectrum.\n\nIn 1985, Marriott ended his relationship with Piercey when he met Poulton at a Packet of Three gig.\n\nDue to his financial situation, Marriott jokingly later renamed the group Steve Marriott and the Official Receivers. In the mid-1980s Marriott and Poulton moved to a rented cottage in the small village of Arkesden. The 16th century cottage was also used for location shots for the home of the title character in the BBC's long-running television series \"Lovejoy\", starring Ian McShane. Marriott became well-known locally, often popping into the pub opposite his home to buy bottles of brandy and borrowing glasses. He once turned up wearing trainers and a dressing gown and became something of an eccentric figure, playing pranks, particularly on the owner of the pub.\n\nDue to past experiences, in later years Marriott became wary of success and fame as well as involvement with big record companies, and turned down lucrative concert and recording deals with names such as EMI. Because of this attitude, the band grew resentful, believing that he was holding them back, and Packet of Three was disbanded. For the next year Marriott took time off. By now he was 39 years old. He had health problems, was overweight, and had a scruffy appearance. There was little left of the striking 1960s mod icon.\n\nFilm-maker Paolo Sedazzari recalled, \"I remember going to see him in the 1980s, and he was brilliant. Great voice, great guitarist but what I couldn't get over were the dungarees and the mullet haircut. That was really disappointing.\" According to his wife, Marriott still smoked cannabis and took cocaine, but nothing compared to what he had once consumed. In his later years Marriott liked reading; his favourite authors included Stephen King, Philip K. Dick and anything on Noël Coward, whom Marriott had always admired.\n\nIn May 1988, Marriott started rehearsing with a band from Leicestershire, the DTs, though by the time they starting touring they were called Steve Marriott and the DTs. Despite being out of the public gaze, Marriott was still asked to participate in various projects. Andrew Lloyd Webber asked Marriott to record two songs for his musical \"Evita\", though after becoming drunk at the meeting Marriott ungraciously declined. Film composer Stephen Parsons asked Marriott to sing the title track \"Shakin' All Over\" for the low budget horror film \"Gnaw: Food of the Gods II\" (1989); Marriott agreed, seeing it as easy money. While recording the song, Trax Records asked Marriott to record a solo album. \"Thirty Seconds to Midnite\" was recorded at Alexandra Palace. Marriott used the money to buy a narrowboat. On 14 July 1989, Marriott and Toni Poulton were married at Epping Register Office. Afterwards, they threw a party at their cottage.\n\nDuring this period Jim Leverton got in touch and Marriott formed a new group called Steve Marriott's Next Band, with Leverton and ex-members of both the DTs and the Official Receivers. When several members left due to financial disagreements, the band name Packet of Three resurfaced.\n\nBy 1990 Marriott was playing an average 200 gigs a year, when Frampton flew into Britain and asked Marriott to reform Humble Pie to produce a one-off album and a reunion tour. The payment would be enough to allow Marriott to take things easier. He agreed, and they flew out to Frampton's recording studio in Los Angeles on 27 January 1991. They began writing songs, but the project was never completed, as Marriott had a change of heart and returned home. \n\nTwo recorded songs from this final effort, \"The Bigger They Come\" and \"I Won't Let You Down\", with Marriott on vocals (and guitar), appeared on Frampton's album \"Shine On: A Collection\". A third song, \"Out of the Blue\", featuring both Marriott and Frampton, was featured on the first solo recording Frampton made after Marriott's death. A fourth song, \"An Itch You Can't Scratch\", has been found on many illegal compilations and even on one of two \"authorised\" British releases. The recording date, and whether Frampton played on it, have never been verified.\n\nOn Friday 19 April 1991, Marriott and Poulton flew home from the United States, where Marriott had recorded songs for a future album with Frampton. During the flight, according to Poulton, Marriott was drinking heavily, was in a foul mood, and the two argued constantly. After arriving in the UK, a mutual friend met them and they all went for dinner to one of Marriott's favourite restaurants, The Straw Hat in Sawbridgeworth, where he consumed more alcohol. After dinner, they returned to their friend's house and decided to stay overnight, since it was late, but upstairs in bed, Marriott and Poulton continued to argue. Poulton finally fell asleep and later woke to discover that Marriott had taken a taxi to his home in the nearby village of Arkesden.\n\nAt about 6:30 am on 20 April, a passing motorist saw the roof of Marriott's cottage ablaze and called the fire brigade. It was reported that four fire engines were needed to put out the fire. In newspaper interviews, Assistant Divisional Fire Officer Keith Dunatis, who found Marriott, said:\n\n\"It was a tough fight getting upstairs. We searched the bedroom areas and it was very hot, we knew immediately that no-one could have survived the fire. We began to feel around the walls and discovered him lying on the floor between the bed and the wall. I would say he had been in bed and tried to escape. As soon as I saw the body clearly I knew who it was. I used to be a fan, it's difficult to put my feelings into words. The scene was horrific in that corner of the room. I saw him lying there and thought what a pity it all was. I deal with many fires but this one was like walking down memory lane. We managed to salvage all his guitars and musical equipment. I feel a bit upset, all the firemen do. It was like seeing part of our lives gone forever.\" – (Fire Officer) \n\nIt is believed that the most likely cause of the fire was that soon after arriving home, jet-lagged and tired, in the early hours, Marriott had lit a cigarette while in bed and almost immediately fallen into a deep sleep.\n\nSince Marriott was found lying on the floor between the bed and wall, investigators concluded that he tried unsuccessfully to escape after being awakened by the blaze. Disoriented and confused after inhaling large amounts of thick smoke, Marriott had turned left instead of right towards the bedroom door and safety. He had been unable to rectify his mistake before being overcome with smoke. At the inquest, a verdict of accidental death by smoke inhalation was recorded. Marriott's blood was found to contain quantities of Valium (taken earlier for flight nerves), alcohol and cocaine.\n\n\"He (Marriott) was certainly the most talented person I ever worked with. He was like a brother to me and I was devastated when he died. He always lived on the edge and I was always waiting for a 'phone call to say that he had died but I never dreamed it would be under those circumstances. He's never got the credit he deserves. He should be in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame because he was the greatest white soul singer that England ever produced. I'm certain that if you caught the likes of Rod Stewart and Paul Rodgers in a private moment and asked them who was the main man, they would say Steve Marriott.\" – Jerry Shirley \n\nThe Small Faces song \"All or Nothing\" was played as the requiem at Marriott's funeral held on 30 April 1991, at the Harlow crematorium. Amongst the mourners, noted attendees included ex-Small Faces drummer Kenney Jones, as well as Peter Frampton, Joe Brown, PP Arnold, Terence Stamp, Jerry Shirley and Greg Ridley. Among those who sent wreaths were David Gilmour (of Pink Floyd) and Rod Stewart and his then-wife Rachel Hunter. Nothing was heard from ex-Small Faces members Ian McLagan or Ronnie Lane.\n\nTo mark the 10th anniversary of Marriott's death a tribute concert was held at the London Astoria on 20 April 2001. All the songs performed at this concert were from the Small Faces or Humble Pie catalogue. Pre-1980 Humble Pie alumni Peter Frampton, Clem Clempson, Greg Ridley and Jerry Shirley gave a one-off performance. Other guest appearances included two original members of the Small Faces, Kenney Jones and Ian McLagan, Paul Weller, Noel Gallagher and Bobby Tench from Marriott's 1980's Humble Pie line-up and John's Children. Other musicians such as Alan White, Gem Archer, Midge Ure, Zak Starkey, Rabbit Bundrick, Steve Ellis and Tony Rivers appeared in band line-ups during the two and half-hour concert, released on DVD as the Stevie Marriott Astoria Memorial concert. The proceeds of the concert were donated to \"The Small Faces Charitable Trust\" set up by Kenney Jones in memory of Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane.\n\nIn September 2007 Marriott, along with the other members of the Small Faces and manager Don Arden, were honoured with a plaque unveiled in Carnaby Street, on the site of Don Arden's offices, the spiritual home of the band in the 1960s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Also according to Matthews, \"His book documents how the clashes of equipment philosophy between cave divers and wreck divers mirrored the clash of diving subcultures.\"\n\n"}
