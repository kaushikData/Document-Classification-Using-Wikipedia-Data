{"id": "267933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=267933", "title": "Breed", "text": "Breed\n\nA breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of \"breeds\" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset.\n\nWhen bred together, individuals of the same breed pass on these predictable traits to their offspring, and this abilityknown as \"breeding true\"is a requirement for a breed. Plant breeds are more commonly known as cultivars. The offspring produced as a result of breeding animals of one breed with other animals of another breed are known as crossbreeds or mixed breeds. Crosses between animal or plant variants above the level of breed/cultivar (i.e. between species, subspecies, botanical \"variety\", even different genera) are referred to as \"hybrids\".\n\nThe breeder (or group of breeders) who initially establishes a breed does so by selecting individual animals from within a gene pool that they see as having the necessary qualities needed to enhance the breed model they are aiming for. These animals are referred to as foundation stock. Furthermore, the breeder mates the most desirable representatives of the breed from his or her point of view, aiming to pass such characteristics to their progeny. This process is known as selective breeding. A written description of desirable and undesirable breed representatives is referred to as a breed standard.\n\nBreed specific characteristics, also known as breed traits, are inherited, and purebred animals pass such traits from generation to generation. Thus, all specimens of the same breed carry several genetic characteristics of the original foundation animal(s). In order to maintain the breed, a breeder would select those animals with the most desirable traits to achieve further maintenance and developing of such traits. At the same time, the breed would avoid animals carrying characteristics undesirable or not typical for the breed, including faults or genetic defects. The population within the same breed should consist of a sufficient number of animals to maintain the breed within the specified parameters without the necessity of forced inbreeding. \n\nDomestic animal breeds commonly differ from country to country, and from nation to nation. Breeds originating in a certain country are known as \"native breeds\" of that country.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1763319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1763319", "title": "Channelrhodopsin", "text": "Channelrhodopsin\n\nChannelrhodopsins are a subfamily of retinylidene proteins (rhodopsins) that function as light-gated ion channels. They serve as sensory photoreceptors in unicellular green algae, controlling phototaxis: movement in response to light. Expressed in cells of other organisms, they enable light to control electrical excitability, intracellular acidity, calcium influx, and other cellular processes. Channelrhodopsin-1 (ChR1) and Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) from the model organism \"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\" are the first discovered channelrhodopsins. Variants have been cloned from other algal species, and more are expected.\n\nIn terms of structure, channelrhodopsins are retinylidene proteins. They are seven-transmembrane proteins like rhodopsin, and contain the light-isomerizable chromophore all-\"trans\"-retinal (an aldehyde derivative of vitamin A). The retinal chromophore is covalently linked to the rest of the protein through a protonated Schiff base. Whereas most 7-transmembrane proteins are G protein-coupled receptors that open other ion channels indirectly via second messengers (i.e., they are metabotropic), channelrhodopsins directly form ion channels (i.e., they are ionotropic). This makes cellular depolarization extremely fast, robust, and useful for bioengineering and neuroscience applications, including photostimulation.\n\nThe natural (\"wild-type\") ChR2 absorbs blue light with an absorption and action spectrum maximum at 480 nm. When the all-\"trans\"-retinal complex absorbs a photon, it induces a conformational change from all-\"trans\" to 13-\"cis\"-retinal. This change introduces a further one in the transmembrane protein, opening the pore to at least 6 Å. Within milliseconds, the retinal relaxes back to the all-trans form, closing the pore and stopping the flow of ions. Most natural channelrhodopsins are nonspecific cation channels, conducting H, Na, K, and Ca ions. Recently, anion-conducting channelrhodopsins have been discovered.\n\nChannelrhodopsins are key tools in optogenetics. The C-terminal end of Channelrhodopsin-2 extends into the intracellular space and can be replaced by fluorescent proteins without affecting channel function. This kind of fusion construct can be useful to visualize the morphology of ChR2 expressing cells. Point mutations close to the retinal binding pocket have been shown to affect the biophysical properties of the channelrhodopsin, resulting in a variety of different tools.\n\nClosing of the channel after optical activation can be substantially delayed by mutating the protein residues C128 or D156. This modification results in super-sensitive channelrhodopsins that can be opened by a blue light pulse and closed by a green or yellow light pulse (Step-function opsins). Mutating the E123 residue accelerates channel kinetics (ChETA), and the resulting ChR2 mutants have been used to spike neurons at up to 200 Hz. In general, channelrhodopsins with slow kinetics are more light-sensitive on the population level, as open channels accumulate over time even at low light levels.\n\nH134R and T159C mutants display increased photocurrents, and a combination of T159 and E123 (ET/TC) has slightly larger photocurrents and slightly faster kinetics than wild-type ChR2. Among ChR variants, ChIEF, a chimera and point mutant of ChR1 and ChR2, demonstrates the largest photocurrents and the least desensitization and has kinetics similar to wild-type ChR2.\n\nChimeric channelrhodopsins have been developed by combining transmembrane helices from ChR1 and VChR1, leading to the development of ChRs with red spectral shifts (such as C1V1 and ReaChR). ReaChR has improved membrane trafficking and strong expression in mammalian cells, and has been used for minimally invasive, transcranial activation of brainstem motoneurons. Searches for homologous sequences in other organisms has yielded spectrally improved and stronger red-shifted channelrhodpsins (Chrimson). In combination with ChR2, these yellow/red light-sensitive channelrhodopsins allow controlling two populations of neurons independently with light pulses of different colors.\n\nA blue-shifted channelrhodopsin has been discovered in the alga \"Scherffelia dubia\". After some engineering to improve membrane trafficking and speed, the resulting tool (CheRiff) produced large photocurrents at 460 nm excitation. It has been combined with the Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicator jRCaMP1b in an all-optical system called the OptoCaMP.\n\nThe L132C mutation (CatCh) increases the permeability for calcium and generates very large currents. Mutating E90 to the positively charged amino acid arginine turns channelrhodopsin from an unspecific cation channel into a chloride-conducting channel (ChloC). The selectivity for Cl- was further improved by replacing negatively charged residues in the channel pore, making the reversal potential more negative. Selective chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins (iChloC, iC++, \"Gt\"ACR) inhibit neuronal spiking in cell culture and in intact animals when illuminated with blue light.\n\nChannelrhodopsins can be readily expressed in excitable cells such as neurons using a variety of transfection techniques (viral transfection, electroporation, gene gun) or transgenic animals. The light-absorbing pigment retinal is present in most cells (of vertebrates) as Vitamin A, making it possible to photostimulate neurons without adding any chemical compounds. Before the discovery of channelrhodopsins, neuroscientists were limited to recording the activity of neurons in the brain and correlate this activity with behavior. This is not sufficient to prove that the recorded neural activity actually caused that behavior. Controlling networks of genetically modified cells with light, an emerging field known as Optogenetics., allows researchers now to explore the causal link between activity in a specific group of neurons and mental events, e.g. decision making. Optical control of behavior has been demonstrated in nematodes, fruit flies, zebrafish, and mice. Recently, chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins have been engineered and were also found in nature. These tools can be used to silence neurons in cell culture and in live animals by shunting inhibition.\n\nUsing multiple colors of light expands the possibilities of optogenetic experiments. The blue-light sensitive ChR2 and the yellow light-activated chloride pump halorhodopsin together enable multiple-color optical activation and silencing of neural activity. VChR1 from the colonial alga \"Volvox carteri\" absorbs maximally at 535 nm and had been used to stimulate cells with yellow light (580 nm), although photocurrents generated by VChR1 are typically very small. However, VChR1-ChR2 hybrids have been developed using directed evolution that display maximal excitation at 560 nm, and 50% of peak absorbance at wavelengths over 600 nm.\n\nUsing fluorescently labeled ChR2, light-stimulated axons and synapses can be identified. This is useful to study the molecular events during the induction of synaptic plasticity. Transfected cultured neuronal networks can be stimulated to perform some desired behaviors for applications in robotics and control. ChR2 has also been used to map long-range connections from one side of the brain to the other, and to map the spatial location of inputs on the dendritic tree of individual neurons.\n\nVisual function in blind mice can be partially restored by expressing ChR2 in inner retinal cells. In the future, ChR2 might find medical applications, e.g. in forms of retinal degeneration or for deep-brain stimulation. Optical cochlear implants have been shown to work well in animal experiments and might lead to the first application of optogenetics in human patients.\n\nMotility and photoorientation of microalgae have been studied over more than hundred years in many laboratories worldwide. In 1980, Ken Foster developed the first consistent theory about the functionality of algal eyes. He also analyzed published action spectra and complemented blind cells with retinal and retinal analogues, which led to the conclusion that the photoreceptor for motility responses in Chlorophyceae is rhodopsin. \nPhotocurrents of the Chlorophyceae \"Heamatococcus pluvialis\" and \"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\" were studied over many years in the groups of Oleg Sineshchekov and Peter Hegemann, resulting in two seminal publications in the years 1978 and 1991. Based on action spectroscopy and simultaneous recordings of photocurrents and flagellar beating, it was determined that the photoreceptor currents and subsequent flagellar movements are mediated by rhodopsin and control phototaxis and photophobic responses. The extremely fast rise of the photoreceptor current after a brief light flash led to the conclusion that the rhodopsin and the channel are intimately linked in a protein complex, or even within one single protein. However, biochemical purification of the rhodopsin-photoreceptor(s) was unsuccessful over many years. \nThe nucleotide sequences of the rhodopsins now called channelrhodopsins ChR1 and ChR2 were finally uncovered in a large-scale EST sequencing project in \"C. reinhardtii\". Independent submission of the same sequences to GenBank by three research groups generated confusion about their naming: The names \"cop-3\" and \"cop-4\" were used for initial submission by Hegemann's group; \"csoA\" and \"csoB\" by Spudich's group; and \"acop-1\" and \"acop-2\" by Takahashi's group. Both sequences were found to function as single-component light-activated cation channels in a \"Xenopus\" oocytes and human kidney cells (HEK) by Georg Nagel, Ernst Bamberg, Peter Hegemann and others. The name \"channelrhodopsin\" was coined to highlight this unusual property, and the sequences were renamed accordingly. Meanwhile, their roles in generation of photoreceptor currents in algal cells were characterized by Oleg Sineshchekov, Kwang-Hwan Jung and John Spudich, and Peter Berthold and Peter Hegemann. In 2005, three groups sequentially established ChR2 as a tool for genetically targeted optical remote control (optogenetics) of neurons, neural circuits and behavior. At first, Karl Deisseroth's lab (in a paper published in August 2005) demonstrated that ChR2 could be deployed to control mammalian neurons \"in vitro\", achieving temporal precision on the order of milliseconds (both in terms of delay to spiking and in terms of temporal jitter). This was a significant finding, since, first, all opsins (microbial as well as vertebrate) require retinal as the light-sensing co-factor and it was unclear whether central mammalian nerve cells would contain sufficient retinal levels, but they do; second, it showed, despite the small single-channel conductance, sufficient potency to drive mammalian neurons above action potential threshold; and, third, it demonstrated channelrhodopsin to be the first optogenetic tool, with which neural activity could be controlled with the temporal precision at which neurons operate (milliseconds). An earlier tool for photostimulation, cHARGe, demonstrated proof of principle in cultured neurons but was never used by other groups since it operated with a precision on the order of seconds, was highly variable, and did not allow control of individual action potentials.\n\nA second study was published later by Peter Hegemann's and Stefan Herlitze's groups confirming the ability of ChR2 to control the activity of vertebrate neurons, at this time in the chick spinal cord. This study was the first wherein ChR2 was expressed alongside an optical silencer, vertebrate rhodopsin-4 in this case, demonstrating for the first time that excitable cells could be activated and silenced using these two tools simultaneously, illuminating the tissue at different wavelengths.\n\nThe groups of Alexander Gottschalk and Ernst Bamberg (with Georg Nagel taking the experimental lead) demonstrated that ChR2, if expressed in specific neurons or muscle cells, can evoke predictable behaviors, i.e. can control the nervous system of an intact animal, in this case the invertebrate \"C. elegans\". This was the first using ChR2 to steer the behavior of an animal in an optogenetic experiment, rendering a genetically specified cell type subject to optical remote control. Although both aspects had been illustrated earlier that year by another group, the Miesenböck lab, deploying the indirectly light-gated ion channel P2X2, it was henceforth microbial opsins like channelrhodopsin that dominated the field of genetically targeted remote control of excitable cells, due to the power, speed, targetability, ease of use, and temporal precision of direct optical activation, not requiring any external chemical compound such as caged ligands.\n\nTo overcome its principal downsides — the small single-channel conductance (especially in steady-state), the limitation to one optimal excitation wavelength (~470 nm, blue) as well as the relatively long recovery time, not permitting controlled firing of neurons above 20–40 Hz — ChR2 has been optimized using genetic engineering. A point mutation H134R (exchanging the amino acid Histidine in position 134 of the native protein for an Arginine) resulted in increased steady-state conductance, as described in a 2005 paper that also established ChR2 as an optogenetic tool in \"C. elegans\". In 2009, Roger Tsien's lab optimized ChR2 for further increases in steady-state conductance and dramatically reduced desensitization by creating chimeras of ChR1 and ChR2 and mutating specific amino acids, yielding ChEF and ChIEF, which allowed the driving of trains of action potentials up to 100 Hz. In 2010, the groups of Hegemann and Deisseroth introduced an E123T mutation into native ChR2, yielding ChETA, which has faster on- and off-kinetics, permitting the control of individual action potentials at frequencies up to 200 Hz (in appropriate cell types).\n\nThe groups of Hegemann and Deisseroth also discovered that the introduction of the point mutation C128S makes the resulting ChR2-derivative a step-function tool: Once \"switched on\" by blue light, ChR2(C128S) stays in the open state until it is switched off by yellow light – a modification that deteriorates temporal precision, but increases light sensitivity by two orders of magnitude. They also discovered and characterized VChR1 in the multicellular algae \"Volvox carteri\". VChR1 produces only tiny photocurrents, but with an absorption spectrum that is red-shifted relative to ChR2. Using parts of the ChR1 sequence, photocurrent amplitude was later improved to allow excitation of two neuronal populations at two distinct wavelengths.\n\nDeisseroth's group has pioneered many applications in live animals such as genetically targeted remote control in rodents \"in vivo\", the optogenetic induction of learning in rodents, the experimental treatment of Parkinson's disease in rats, and the combination with fMRI (opto-fMRI). Other labs have pioneered the combination of ChR2 stimulation with calcium imaging for all-optical experiments, mapping of long-range and local neural circuits, ChR2 expression from a transgenic locus – directly or in the \"Cre-lox\" conditional paradigm – as well as the two-photon excitation of ChR2, permitting the activation of individual cells.\n\nIn March 2013, the Brain Prize (Grete Lundbeck European Brain Research Prize) was jointly awarded to Ernst Bamberg, Edward Boyden, Karl Deisseroth, Peter Hegemann, Gero Miesenböck, and Georg Nagel for \"their invention and refinement of optogenetics\". The same year, Peter Hegemann and Georg Nagel received the Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine for \"the discovery of channelrhodopsin\". In 2015, Edward Boyden and Karl Deisseroth received the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for \"the development and implementation of optogenetics\".\n\n"}
{"id": "31587442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31587442", "title": "Childbirth in Thailand", "text": "Childbirth in Thailand\n\nThis article documents traditional and some modern childbirth practices in Thailand. Traditional principles are largely influenced by the folk beliefs in Central and North Thailand, and modern practices by the western medical model.\n\nTraditional Thai medicine is based on the mixed indigenous traditions of Indian, Chinese, and Khmer influences. Historically, Jivaka Kumar Bhaccha is considered the \"Father Doctor\" of Thai medicine. The \"circle of life\" is a central concept in Thai medical philosophy, which involves the three essences of the human body that must be kept in balance to maintain health. The three essences are: (1) \"Energy\" (holds mind, body, and heart together, similar to qi/chi/prana), (2) \"Body\" (physical substance), and (3) \"Citta\" (mind/heart, non-physical being that holds all thoughts, emotions, spirit, inner self). Thai traditional medicine has three branches that correspond to the three essences: Thai massage, herbalism (including dietary regimen), and spiritual or religious healing. The three branches are used to balance each of the essences. For example, there are ten tastes of foods and herbs that are recognized by the Thai medicine, and tastes opposite of the disease process would be used to treat it. Similarly, the four elements of the body (fire, water, air, and earth) must be kept in balance by eating certain foods.\n\nFemale life expectancy at birth in Thailand is 76.08 years (as compared to 71.24 years for men). Two percent of Thai women smoke. The current (2011) birth rate is estimated to be 12.95 births per 1,000 population. The maternal mortality ratio is 20.63 per 100,000 live births, and the major causes of maternal death are hemorrhage (27.8%), sepsis (8.73%), toxemia (16.7%), amniotic fluid embolism (11.9%), and other causes (8.73%) (2003).\n\nA high percentage of laboring women (97%) are attended by skilled health personnel, which is much higher than the regional average (49%) (2008). Women in Thailand are also much more likely to attend four or more ante-natal visits (74%) compared to women in other countries in Southeast Asia (43%) and use contraception (81% compared to 58%) (2008).\n\nThe under-5 mortality rate (per 1000 live births) has decreased to 14 (2008) from 28 (2002). Infant mortality has also decreased from 20 (2002) to 16.39 deaths per 1000 births (2011).\n\nThere are many traditional beliefs associated with the way pregnancy should be carried out. According to the central Thai beliefs, conception occurs when a khwan (soul) flies into the womb during a sexual encounter. A woman whose period stops and who starts craving sour foods is thought to be pregnant. Once a woman finds out she is pregnant, she is to tell her partner first, followed by her mother and her mother-in-law. Infertility is seen as imbalance in one of the \"essences\". Certain acupressure points, however, are used to resolve the issue.\nAbortion is seen by Buddhists as \"impeding an individual's rebirth and disobeying a religious prohibition on taking life\" and it is currently illegal in Thailand. Only in the following three cases it is allowed: (1) if mother’s life is in danger, (2) if mother's physical or mental health is at risk, or (3) if the pregnancy is a result of an offense or seduction of a girl under 15. However, about two-thirds of women seek help outside of the main healthcare system to terminate the unplanned pregnancy, and 12% attempt to do it themselves.\n\nIn Thai folklore there is a ghost known as \"Krasue\" (กระสือ) who haunts pregnant women in their homes just before or after the childbirth. Village legends say that it hovers around the house of the pregnant woman uttering sharp cries to instill fear. It uses an elongated proboscis-like tongue to reach the fetus or its placenta within the womb. This habit, among other unmentionable things that this spirit does, is believed to be the cause of many diseases affecting mainly rural women during their pregnancy.\n\nSince pregnancy is considered to be a \"hot\" condition in Thai medicine, foods to maintain warmth are preferred, such as ginger tea, coconut milk, young coconut meat, salty foods, tamarind, fish, garlic, onion, and warm liquids. Those who consume pak plang, a slippery vine-like green vegetable, will have an easy birth, since it will make the baby’s body slippery. Ya tom herbal medicine could be prepared as tea and would make the baby strong and easy to deliver if the pregnant woman drinks the tea three times a day for three consecutive days.\nHowever, khong salaeng (allergic foodstuffs) must be avoided by pregnant women, since it may cause unwanted problems during labor or for the unborn child. \"Khong salaeng\" foods include papaya salad, pickled food, spicy hot food (baby may be born hairless), coffee and tea (baby will be not intelligent), shellfish (prevents perineum from drying after delivery), and Thai eggplants (may cause anal pain after delivery). Women are also advised to eat only half a banana, since birth may become obstructed if she eats a whole banana.\n\nAccording to traditional beliefs, strenuous activities, such as heavy lifting, farm work, and even driving a car may lead to a miscarriage or stillbirth, however this may sometimes be unavoidable by the rural poor. Regular activity, however, would promote easy birth by making the abdomen \"loose\" (\"tong klon\") and therefore aiding in the downward rotation of the baby. Idleness and frequent resting, on the other hand, complicates birth.\n\nThere are accounts that sexual activity was promoted during pregnancy in central Thailand since sperm would make the baby strong, however, in the northern parts of Thailand it is seen as a form of vigorous activity that may result in miscarriage. Although pregnant women are prohibited from attending a funeral, wearing a brooch on the abdomen would counteract any negative effects on the fetus. Women should also not make any advanced preparations, such as buying or making baby clothes, as this may result the death of the baby. Other pregnancy-related beliefs include not sitting in the stairway (causes obstructed birth), not burying anything in the soil (difficult birth), and having \"magical showers\" (to promote easy delivery and emotional calmness). These showers should be blessed with sacred words known as \"nam mon\" by \"mor mon\"' (a magical healer, or even a monk); they are usually done in an open-aired space from the eighth to ninth month of pregnancy. During the last weeks of normal pregnancy, a woman may choose to go to a masseuse for \"lifting of the uterus (\"yok thong\") to increase comfort\".\n\nToday, pregnancy test kits are available at pharmacies. Pregnancy can also be confirmed at a gynecologist's office using blood and urine tests. Currently, pregnant women are required to attend at least four ante-natal visits. Normal pregnancies can be managed by gynecological nurses or midwives, while high-risk pregnancies must be monitored by obstetricians. Ideally, a woman would attend ante-natal check-ups \"every month until 28 weeks of gestation, then every fortnight from 28–32 weeks and every week after 32 weeks\", however, the number of visits will depend on the woman and her healthcare providers. In Thailand, ante-natal care is free in the public health services sector. There is a private and public sector in healthcare, the latter provided by the Ministry of Public Health and teaching hospitals. In the 2005 study by Liamputtong, et al., women of Chiang Mai (northern Thailand) revealed that they \"only incorporate cultural knowledge when it is practicable and suitable to their daily living situations\".\n\nIn the 1960s, 99% of the women in villages gave birth at home. Today the number is much lower, as most Thai women give birth in hospitals and clinics, generally where they go for ante-natal care. However, homebirths are becoming popular, but they may not be fully covered by insurance policies. Traditionally, Thai women would give birth at home, either in the bedroom or the kitchen. The delivery room at home is usually decorated with Yant Trinisinghé, \"small flags inscribed with sacred numbers from one to nine\" or with letters and signs; each flag is a \"symbol of a long mantra passage, believed to have power to ward off evil spirits\". Buffalo leather can be used instead of flags.\n\nAccording to WHO's 2008 Thailand health profile, 99% of urban, 97% or rural, and 93% of the poorest 20% of women have their children delivered by skilled health persons, which is a much better compared to the regional average of 49%. As a part of the four-year curriculum, all nurses go through half a year of midwifery training, and may later choose to specialize. However, an obstetrician carries most responsibility during a birth in the hospitals It is unclear how the traditional delivery assistants are trained, but most likely through observational experiences.\n\nThe traditional delivery assistant, who is usually a woman, is called \"Mo Tamaye\" in the central Thailand and \"Mae Jang\" in the north. It is generally accepted that labor starts when the water breaks. If the family cannot get to the nearest medical facility, or does not want to, \"Mo Tamaye\" is called. Usually, the husband and \"Mo Tamaye\" are present during delivery, but relatives and children may attend as well; however, the woman in labor must be covered from the waist to knee.\n\nThere are variations in the traditional birthing positions. In one, a folded mattress would be supporting a woman’s back while her husband would provide support sitting behind her and letting her grab onto his thighs. There would be foot supports made out of bamboo that a woman can push on during contractions. In another position, a woman would be sitting, with \"Mo Tamaye\" supporting her from behind, and would pull on a rope that is hanging from the ceiling to alleviate some pain. The woman must take an active role in the process by breathing and pushing with contractions, with the help of \"Mo Tamaye\". In a medical setting, a woman would most likely have limited options for positions and would be laid flat on the bed to deliver. Culturally, there is no need to keep silent during the birthing process, but pain management is available in most clinics. There are no data regarding the use of fetal monitoring; however, it is likely used in the westernized hospital settings, which would limit woman's mobility during labor. Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok is currently the only hospital in the country that offers natural and water birth.\n\nIn case of birth complications, the traditional birth assistant would give the woman some holy water or press on her belly. There were no specific foods mentioned to eat during labor. To promote an easy delivery, all windows and doors must be open and the woman must be facing east to symbolize the emergence of new life. The husband should also pile logs outside facing east. Any fastened nails must be undone, and no one should be nailing nails to avoid stalled birth. To be born with an umbilical (holy) cord wrapped abound neck was considered a sign of fortune.\n\nIn the medical model of pregnancy, Caesarean section is performed should complications arise. However, the rate of C-sections has been increasing globally, which may be due to financial incentives. Thailand is no exception, with rates rising from 15.2% (1990) to 22.4% (1996) to 34% (2007). A study in 2000 concluded that \"private cases have a 5.83 higher chance of primary cesarean section than non-private cases\" because \"physicians feel obliged to provide personal delivery services, when triggered by leisure and time conflict, [which] leads to higher and possibly unnecessary cesarean procedures\".\n\nThe postpartum period begins right after the birth of the child, but it is not specified when it ends. It takes place at home following home birth, or in the hospital for 2–3 days and then at home following hospital birth.\n\nFollowing a traditional delivery, \"Mo Tamaye\" would milk the umbilical cord three times away from the baby “to remove dirt,” then push it back, tie the cord in two places with a special cotton string, and cut the cord in between the two fastened places. The cut cord is then burned, and placenta is buried, usually by the father.\n\nAfter a woman gives birth to her first child, she is considered an adult. She then undergoes the \"Yu Fai\" when she must \"lie near fire\" for an odd number of days, usually around 11 days, so that her uterus will shrink back to normal size. After each following birth, the number of days spent near fire may be decreased. Also, a wooden box with a fire pot may be placed on the woman's stomach to serve the same purpose. Fire is also said to scare off evil spirits, especially combined with the lemongrass aroma. After a \"Yu Fai\", a woman is allowed to move out of her parents' residence, where she would live before and during the pregnancy, since she is now a mature adult.\n\nAs with the pregnancy diet, warm foods are encouraged, such as hot curries. A woman's diet must consist of rice and vegetables in the first few months after pregnancy; meat, with exception of fish, must be avoided. From a traditional Thai medicine perspective, \"sour tastes [do] not dry out the body, but built up water; egg [is] too cooling; jackfruit [brings] in wind [air]; glutinous rice and the sugar of sweets wet the uterus; fruits [do] not give strength and [are] excessively cooling\". Herbal teas (\"naam puu loey\") should be consumed, and showers with herbal water (\"naam puu loeyand naam bai paw\") should be taken daily without washing hair the first two weeks.\n\nHousehold duties would be taken care by female relatives, and older children. Traditionally, female relatives would also check on the new mother. Within 4 to 8 weeks a woman must attend a health clinic for a check-up and to register her child's birth. Labour Protection Act of 1998 guarantees women to have three months of maternity leave, to retain the job a woman had prior to pregnancy, and to temporary change duties with a doctor's letter. In practice, labor rights are very weak in Thailand and these laws are not generally enforceable. Labor activists are prosecuted, migrant laborers are exploited, and trafficked workers in the sex and fishing industries are common.\n\nThere are many variations in tradition across Thailand most include the beautification of the child. Central Thai people say the baby is \"tog fag\" (falls on bamboo) when he or she is born. After \"Mo Tamaye\" cuts the umbilical cord, she washes and beautifies the baby with yellow and white powder. On the third day after birth, the \"Lon Dek Nai Kadon\" rite (translates to \"rock the cradle in which a new born baby is sleeping\") is carried out. A baby is placed into a basket with a pencil and a notebook (for brightness) and money (for richness); girls are also given knives (to cut and comb hair) (Attagara 1968, p. 103) and cooking utensils. The basket with the baby and instruments is then handed over to \"a respectable man in the village\". This means that the baby became his adopted child temporarily, which reflects that the parents expect their baby to be rich and respectable like the adoptive.”\n\nAnother tradition includes making offerings at a temple (\"wat\") on the third day after the baby is born to obtain a blessing from a monk. The \"fire shaving ceremony\" takes place when the child reaches the age of one month and one day, which involves cutting of the baby's hair. As a precaution, babies must be kept away from the rain. Circumcision is not very prevalent in Thailand; only 13% of Thai male population are circumcised.\n\nIt is not specified when the newborn period ends. There is also no information on the significance of vernix, the baby’s rest, activity, and movement, as well as meconium and handling of the urine and feces.\n\nFor the first month of the baby’s life, the mother must stay very close and \"breastfeed the newborn on its slightest demand\". Babies are also sometimes given a mixture of banana, honey, and water to prevent diarrhea. If the baby cries too much and cannot sleep, it is believed that the baby's guardian spirit, \"Mae Sue\", is teasing the newborn too much. Usual interaction with \"Mae Sue\" is normal, during which the baby will play and laugh by itself.\n\nTraditionally, a name is given to the child on the fourth or fifth day after birth by the father, however, there are variations in this practice across Thailand. Today, both the mother and father can take part in deciding on a name. A child may not hold the same name as royalty.\n\nThere is a variation in the view of twins. While some view twins as needing more resources and being too demanding on a family, others see having twins as lucky, since it is convenient to take care of them at the same time.\n\nAn infant is examined in the first week of life followed by six examinations in the first year. There are three examinations during the second year, and six examinations every other year until the child turns six. Vaccines coincide with the exams, but are not obligatory except for the BCG for tuberculosis prevention.\n"}

It is sometimes referred to as political cleansing. The term is most commonly applied to the former countries of the Eastern Bloc and the post-Soviet states to describe a number of legal and social changes during their periods of postcommunism.\n\nIn some states decommunization included bans on Communist symbols. While sharing common traits the processes of decommunization have run differently in different states.\n\n\nLustration came to refer to government policies of limiting the participation of former communists, and especially informants of the communist secret police, in the successor political appointee positions or even in civil service positions.\n\n\nCommunist parties outside the Baltic states were not outlawed and their members were not prosecuted. Just a few places attempted to exclude even members of communist secret services from decision-making. In a number of countries, the communist party simply changed its name and continued to function.\n\nStephen Holmes of the University of Chicago argued in 1996 that after a period of active decommunization, it was met with a near-universal failure. After the introduction of lustration, demand for scapegoats has become relatively low, and former communists have been elected for high governmental and other administrative positions. Holmes notes that the only real exception was former East Germany, where thousands of former Stasi informers have been fired from public positions.\n\nHolmes suggests the following reasons for the turnoff of decommunization:\n\nMatthew White found an \"LA Times\" article from 1998 and a \"Times of London\" article from 2000, which both reported that from 3 to 6 million Russians and natives of other former Communist states died or were not born due to decreased living conditions after the fall of communism.\n\n"}

Three fellow students escorted Smart back to her hall of residence after a party. Her disappearance is an actively investigated missing person case.\n\nOn September 6, 2016, the San Luis Obispo Sheriff Department reported it had received information about the possible location of Smart's remains, resulting in a hillside excavation on the Cal Poly campus. After three days of digging, bones were recovered from at least one excavation site. However, it was initially unclear if the findings were animal or human, and forensic analysis may take months to determine this.\n\nKristin Smart is not related to Elizabeth Smart, a Salt Lake City, Utah teen who was abducted in June 2002 and found alive in March 2003.\n\nKristin Smart was enrolled at California Polytechnic State University, or Cal Poly, in San Luis Obispo, California. On the night she disappeared, Smart attended a birthday party for a fellow student, which fell on Memorial Day weekend. At approximately 2:00 a.m. on May 25, 1996, she was found passed out on a neighbor's lawn by two fellow students, Cheryl Anderson and Tim Davis, who both had just left the party. They helped Smart to her feet and decided to walk her back to her nearby dormitory. Another student from the party, Paul Flores, joined their group and offered to help the two return Smart to her dorm room safely.\n\nDavis departed the group first since he lived off campus and had driven to the party. Anderson was the second to depart the group after she told Flores that he could walk Smart back to her dorm, since he lived closer. Flores stated to police that he walked Smart as far as his dormitory, Santa Lucia Hall, and then allowed her to walk back to her Muir Hall dorm by herself. This was the last known sighting of her. She did not have any money or credit cards at the time she went missing.\nThe University Police Department originally suspected that Smart had gone on an unannounced vacation, as was common among students over the holidays, and as a result were slow in reporting her as a missing person to local law enforcement.\n\nDuring the Laci Peterson murder investigation, there were unfounded rumors in the media that Laci's husband Scott Peterson had something to do with Smart's disappearance due to their simultaneous attendance at the Cal Poly campus. There was a brief initial inquiry into whether Peterson was tied to the disappearance, with Peterson denying any involvement, and he was eventually ruled out as a suspect by police.\n\nSmart's disappearance remains an unsolved case, with no compelling evidence having been discovered to indicate what happened to her, and no body ever having been discovered. Between 1996 and 2007, many searches were conducted, some using police dogs trained to detect the scent of human remains, including searches of properties owned by the Flores family. No useful leads were found.\n\nOn September 6, 2016, officials from the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Office announced they were investigating a new lead in the case. Cadaver dogs from the FBI were brought in and investigators were preparing to spend approximately four days excavating an area on the Cal Poly campus. After three days, items were found at all three dig sites located on the same hillside near Smart's dorm. A spokesman for the sheriff's office said, \"The items are being analyzed to see whether they are connected to the case, which could take days, weeks or months\". The items uncovered are still being investigated .\n\nSmart's disappearance and slow response by the campus police resulted in the Kristin Smart Campus Security Act being written and sponsored by State Senator Mike Thompson, passed 61–0 by the California State Legislature, and signed into effect by then-Governor Pete Wilson on August 19, 1998. The law took effect on January 1, 1999, and requires all public colleges and publicly funded educational institutions to have their security services make agreements with local police departments about reporting cases involving or possibly involving violence against students, including missing students.\n\nSmart was declared legally dead on May 25, 2002, the sixth anniversary of her disappearance. Her parents, Denise and Stan Smart, took a civil case of wrongful death against Flores, one of the three students who walked Smart to her dorm, in 2005. Flores has denied any involvement in the disappearance. The Flores family had also filed a lawsuit against the Smart family for emotional distress.\n\nThe San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Office still reviews the case regularly, having spent thousands of hours and dollars in the last five years (2011–2016). The FBI have her on file as a high priority missing person investigation, with a reward of $75,000 for information leading to finding her or resolving her case. Terry Black, a Delta-area man, offered a $100,000 reward for Smart's body.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53183077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53183077", "title": "Doomsday Man", "text": "Doomsday Man\n\nDoomsday Man is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Primarily an enemy of Carol Danvers, the character exists within Marvel's main shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Buscema, the character first appeared in \"Silver Surfer\" Vol. 1, #13 (February 1970).\n\nThe Doomsday Man was introduced in \"Silver Surfer\" Vol. 1, #13 and reappeared in \"Ms. Marvel\" Vol. 1, #3-4 in a two-part storyline that ended with it fusing with Kerwin Korman, a villain who had previously appeared in \"Ms. Marvel\" Vol. 1, #1-2 under the name Destructor. The aggregate of Doomsday Man and Korman was subsequently featured in a story-arc that took place in \"The Avengers\" Vol. 3, #15-17 before making its final appearance to date in \"Ms. Marvel\" Vol. 2, #11-12.\n\nAfter the Apollo 11 moon landing, the United States government commissioned Doctor John Kronton to create an automaton that could assist mankind with exploring and colonizing other worlds, a project supervised by Carol Danvers. When construction of the nigh-invincible robot was complete, Danvers, fearing that it could possibly turn against humanity, successfully convinced a Senatorial Commission to abandon the project and seal the android away with other apocalyptic weapons on a desolate island in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe robot (dubbed \"the Doomsday Man\" by the tabloids) activates and breaks free of its prison, taking with it a Cobalt Bomb. Learning of the Doomsday Man's existence, the Silver Surfer attempts to destroy it and prevent the detonation of the Cobalt Bomb with the assistance of Doctor Kronton, who eventually reveals that he had secretly programmed the Doomsday Man to awaken and threaten mankind, intending to stop it himself, thus becoming a hero in the eyes of the people of Earth. The Surfer separates the Doomsday Man from the Cobalt Bomb and attempts to trap it in a pit formed with his Power Cosmic. Doctor Kronton tries to help his creation climb back up to the surface and is killed by it when the Doomsday Man swats him away, an act that causes it to lose its grip and fall deep beneath the Earth's surface while the Surfer safely disposes of the Cobalt Bomb.\n\nA.I.M. acquires and gains control of the Doomsday Man, which they attach to a rocket set for the Kennedy Space Center. Carol Danvers, now the superheroine Ms. Marvel, intercepts the projectile, causing it to crash land near the Florida cave where she had first become Ms. Marvel. Recommencing her battle with the Doomsday Man, Ms. Marvel manages to deactivate it by attacking the weak point that had been secretly installed in the back of its head by Doctor Kronton. Ms. Marvel is then ambushed by Kerwin Korman, the villainous Destructor. Searching for the source of Ms. Marvel's powers, Korman stumbles onto and opens a spare energy core for the nearby Psyche-Magnitron, unleashing an explosive blast of radiation that launches Ms. Marvel out of the cave and fuses Korman with the Doomsday Man.\n\nA.I.M. recovers the amalgam of the Doomsday Man and Korman and leaves a decoy in its place. The fake is later unearthed and destroyed by Captain Marvel.\n\nA.I.M.'s leader, MODOK, eventually loses interest in the Doomsday Man, which is left abandoned beneath a warehouse in The Bronx. When the building is destroyed during an altercation involving A.I.M., the New Warriors, the Avengers and Lord Templar, Doomsday Man escapes and, after concluding that Korman's usefulness as wetware is waning, sets out to replace him with Ms. Marvel.\n\nDoomsday Man breaks the Wrecking Crew out of prison and orders them to capture Ms. Marvel, who has since become Warbird. When the Wrecking Crew are cornered by the Avengers after mistakenly attacking Photon, Doomsday Man attempts to execute them from afar to prevent them from revealing its existence and then abducts Warbird itself, bringing her to its base in the Bronx. As it and Warbird fight, Doomsday Man rants about how it requires her to be complete and about how they both share \"the Kree warrior's bond\" due to being \"born of the Psyche-Magnitron\". The Avengers, having tracked Warbird down, arrive and manage to damage the Doomsday Man enough to incapacitate it and reveal the trapped Korman. Goliath begins studying the Doomsday Man to try and find a way to separate Korman from it, but his work is cut short when he is abducted by Ultron.\n\nDoomsday Man was subsequently reacquired by A.I.M. and once again placed in storage after the organization found itself unable to discern how to control it or how to replicate its fusion with Korman. After spending months in a vegetative state, Korman awoke, assumed control of his and Doomsday Man's shared body and embarked on a rampage, intent on murdering both Warbird (who had gone back to being Ms. Marvel) and \"a great number of people\" by releasing the Targoth, infectious zombies that A.I.M. had manufactured for Slorenia.\n\nMs. Marvel combats Korman while her sidekick, Araña, destroys the Targoth. When Korman severely injures Araña, an enraged Ms. Marvel batters the Doomsday Man with a car, tears it open and nearly kills the exposed Korman, relenting at the last minute when the suicidal Korman whispers, \"Heh... thank... you\". Emergency services are able to stabilize Korman, who is later revealed to have been intentionally awakened and given control of the Doomsday Man by a rogue A.I.M. faction which had also manipulated Ms. Marvel into fighting Korman as a part of a \"test run\" intended to gauge whether or not Korman would be of use against MODOK.\n\nAs it was constructed to be able to withstand and function in every conceivable environment, the Doomsday Man is nigh-invulnerable and superhumanly strong. It also has a laser cannon mounted on its right arm and a \"photonic nullifier\" hidden within its mouth. A.I.M. provided the Doomsday Man with further armaments, including tachyon blasters attached to its head and gun-arm and the power to teleport itself and others.\n\nKerwin Korman merging with it increased the Doomsday Man's mental faculties, giving it a human-like mind and personality, as well as the ability to improvise. Korman himself was a genius inventor and engineer and like Carol Danvers he was mutated into a human-Kree hybrid entity via exposure to the radiation emitted by the Psyche-Magnitron.\n\n"}
{"id": "1333727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1333727", "title": "Emergent evolution", "text": "Emergent evolution\n\nEmergent evolution was the hypothesis that, in the course of evolution, some entirely new properties, such as mind and consciousness, appear at certain critical points, usually because of an unpredictable rearrangement of the already existing entities. The term was originated by the psychologist C. Lloyd Morgan in 1927.\n\nThe hypothesis was widely criticized for providing no mechanism to how entirely new properties emerge, and for its historical roots in teleology.\n\nThe term \"emergent\" was first used to describe the concept by George Lewes in volume two of his 1875 book \"Problems of Life and Mind\" (p. 412). Henri Bergson covered similar themes in his popular 1907 book \"Creative Evolution\" on the Élan vital. Emergence was further developed by Samuel Alexander in his Gifford Lectures at Glasgow during 1916–18 and published as \"Space, Time, and Deity\" (1920). The related term \"emergent evolution\" was coined by C. Lloyd Morgan in his own Gifford lectures of 1921–22 at St. Andrews and published as \"Emergent Evolution\" (1923). In an appendix to a lecture in his book, Morgan acknowledged the contributions of Roy Wood Sellars's \"Evolutionary Naturalism\" (1922).\n\nCharles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace's presentation of natural selection, coupled to the idea of evolution in Western thought, had gained acceptance due to the wealth of observational data provided and the seeming replacement of divine law with natural law in the affairs of men. However, the mechanism of natural selection described at the time only explained how organisms adapted to variation. The cause of genetic variation was unknown at the time.\n\nSt. George Jackson Mivart's \"On the Genesis of Species\" (1872) and Edward Cope's \"Origin of the Fittest\" (1887) raised the need to address the origin of variation between members of a species. William Bateson in 1884 distinguished between the origin of novel variations and the action of natural selection (\"Materials for the Study of Variation Treated with Especial Regard to Discontinuity in the Origin of Species\").\n\nWallace throughout his life continued to support and extend the scope of Darwin's theory of evolution via the mechanism of natural selection. One of his works, \"Darwinism\", was often cited in support of Darwin's theory. He also worked to elaborate and extend Darwin and his ideas on natural selection. However, Wallace also realized that the scope and claim of the theory was limited. Darwin himself had limited it.\n\nIn examining this aspect, excluded \"ab initio\" by Darwin, Wallace came to the conclusion that \"Life\" itself cannot be understood except by means of a theory that includes \"an organising and directive Life-Principle.\" These necessarily involve a \"Creative Power\", a \"directive Mind\" and finally \"an ultimate Purpose\" (the development of Man). It supports the view of John Hunter that \"life is the cause, not the consequence\" of the organisation of matter. Thus, life precedes matter and when it infuses matter, forms living matter (protoplasm).\nWallace then refers to the operation of another power called \"mind\" that utilizes the power of life and is connected with a higher realm than life or matter:\n\nProceeding from Hunter's view that Life is the directive power above and behind living matter, Wallace argues that logically, Mind is the cause of consciousness, which exists in different degrees and kinds in living matter.\n\nThe issue of how change in nature 'emerged' can be found in classical Greek thought - order coming out of chaos and whether by chance or necessity. Aristotle spoke of wholes that were greater than the sum of their parts because of emergent properties. The second-century anatomist and physiologist Galen also distinguished between the resultant and emergent qualities of wholes. (Reid, p. 72)\n\nHegel spoke of the revolutionary progression of life from non-living to conscious and then to the spiritual and Kant perceived that simple parts of an organism interact to produce a progressively complex series of emergences of functional forms, a distinction that carried over to John Stuart Mill (1843), who stated that even chemical compounds have novel features that cannot be predicted from their elements. [Reid, p. 72]\n\nThe idea of an emergent quality that was something new in nature was further taken up by George Henry Lewes (1874–1875), who again noted, as with Galen earlier, that these evolutionary \"emergent\" qualities are distinguishable from adaptive, additive \"resultants.\" Henry Drummond in \"The Descent of Man\" (1894) stated that emergence can be seen in the fact that the laws of nature are different for the organic or vital compared to the inertial inorganic realm.\n\nAs Reid points out, Drummond also realized that greater complexity brought greater adaptability. (Reid. p. 73)\n\nSamuel Alexander took up the idea that emergences had properties that overruled the demands of the lower levels of organization. And more recently, this theme is taken up by John Holland (1998):\n\nAnother major scientist to question natural selection as the motive force of evolution was C. Lloyd Morgan, a zoologist and student of T.H. Huxley, who had a strong influence on Samuel Alexander. His \"Emergent Evolution\" (1923) established the central idea that an emergence might have the appearance of saltation but was best regarded as \"a qualitative change of direction or critical turning point.\"(quoted in Reid, p. 73-74) Morgan, due to his work in animal psychology, had earlier (1894) questioned the continuity view of mental evolution, and held that there were various discontinuities in cross-species mental abilities. To offset any attempt to read anthropomorphism into his view, he created the famous, but often misunderstood methodological canon:\n\nHowever, Morgan realizing that this was being misused to advocate reductionism (rather than as a general methodological caution), introduced a qualification into the second edition of his \"An Introduction to Comparative Psychology\" (1903):\n\nAs Reid observes,\n\nMorgan also fought against the behaviorist school and clarified even more his emergent views on evolution:\n\nHis \"Animal Conduct\" (1930) explicitly distinguishes between three \"grades\" or \"levels of mentality\" which he labeled: 'percipient, perceptive, and reflective.' (p. 42)\n\nMorgan's idea of a polaric relationship between lower and higher, was taken up by Samuel Alexander, who argued that the mental process is not reducible to the neural processes on which it depends at the physical-material level. Instead, they are two poles of a unity of function. Further, the neural process that expressed mental process itself possesses a quality (mind) that the other neural processes don’t. At the same time, the mental process, because it is functionally identical to this particular neural process, is also a vital one.\n\nAnd mental process is also \"something new, \"a fresh creation\", which precludes a psycho-physiological parallelism. Reductionism is also contrary to empirical fact.\n\nAt the same time Alexander stated that his view was not one of animism or vitalism, where the mind is an independent entity action on the brain, or conversely, acted upon by the brain. Mental activity is an emergent, a new \"thing\" not reducible to its initial neural parts.\n\nFor Alexander, the world unfolds in space-time, which has the inherent quality of motion. This motion through space-time results in new “complexities of motion” in the form of a new quality or emergent. The emergent retains the qualities of the prior “complexities of motion” but also has something new that was not there before. This something new comes with its own laws of behavior. Time is the quality that creates motion through Space, and matter is simply motion expressed in forms in Space, or as Alexander says a little later, “complexes of motion.” Matter arises out of the basic ground of Space-Time continuity and has an element of “body” (lower order) and an element of “mind” (higher order), or “the conception that a secondary quality is the mind of its primary substrate.”\n\nMind is an emergent from life and life itself is an emergent from matter. Each level contains and is interconnected with the level and qualities below it, and to the extent that it contains lower levels, these aspects are subject to the laws of that level. All mental functions are living, but not all living functions are mental; all living functions are physico-chemical, but not all physico-chemical processes are living - just as we could say that all people living in Ohio are Americans, but not all Americans live in Ohio. Thus, there are levels of existence, or natural jurisdictions, within a given higher level such that the higher level contains elements of each of the previous levels of existence. The physical level contains the pure dimensionality of Space-Time in addition to the emergent of physico-chemical processes; the next emergent level, life, also contains Space-Time as well as the physico-chemical in addition to the quality of life; the level of mind contains all of the previous three levels, plus consciousness. As a result of this nesting and inter-action of emergents, like fluid Russian dolls, higher emergents cannot be reduced to lower ones, and different laws and methods of inquiry are required for each level.\n\nFor Alexander, the \"directing agency\" or entelechy is found \"in the principle or plan\".\n\nWhile an emergent is a higher complexity, it also results in a new simplicity as it brings a higher order into what was previously less ordered (a new simplex out of a complex). This new simplicity does not carry any of the qualities or aspects of that emergent level prior to it, but as noted, does still carry within it such lower levels so can be understood to that extent through the science of such levels, yet not itself be understood except by a science that is able to reveal the new laws and principles applicable to it.\n\nThe concept or idea of mind, the highest emergent known to us, being at our level, extends all the way down to pure dimensionality or Space-Time. In other words, time is the “mind” of motion, materialising is the “mind” of matter, living the “mind” of life. Motion through pure time (or life astronomical, mind ideational) emerges as matter “materialising” (geological time, life geological, mind existential), and this emerges as life “living” (biological time, life biological, mind experiential), which in turn give us mind “minding” (historical time, life historical, mind cognitional). But there is also an extension possible upwards of mind to what we call Deity.\n\nAlexander goes back to the Greek idea of knowledge being “out there” in the object being contemplated. In that sense, there is not mental object (concept) “distinct” (that is, different in state of being) from the physical object, but only an apparent split between the two, which can then be brought together by proper compresence or participation of the consciousness in the object itself.\n\nBecause of the interconnectedness of the universe by virtue of Space-Time, and because the mind apprehends space, time and motion through a unity of sense and mind experience, there is a form of knowing that is intuitive (participative) - sense and reason are outgrowths from it.\n\nIn a sense, the universe is a participative one and open to participation by mind as well so that mind can intuitively know an object, contrary to what Kant asserted. Participation (togetherness) is something that is “enjoyed” (experienced) not contemplated, though in the higher level of consciousness, it would be contemplated.\n\nEmergent evolution was revived by Robert G. B. Reid, a biology professor at the University of Victoria. In his book \"Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis\" (1985), he stated that the modern evolutionary synthesis with its emphasis on natural selection is an incomplete picture of evolution, and emergent evolution can explain the origin of genetic variation. Biologist Ernst Mayr heavily criticized the book claiming it was a misinformed attack on natural selection. Mayr commented that Reid was working from an \"obsolete conceptual framework\", provided no solid evidence and that he was arguing for a teleological process of evolution.\n\nReid later published the book \"Biological Emergences\" (2007) with a theory on how emergent novelties are generated in evolution. According to Massimo Pigliucci \"Biological Emergences by Robert Reid is an interesting contribution to the ongoing debate on the status of evolutionary theory, but it is hard to separate the good stuff from the more dubious claims.\" Pigliucci noted a dubious claim in the book is that natural selection has no role in evolution. It was positively reviewed by biologist Alexander Badyaev who commented that \"the book succeeds in drawing attention to an under appreciated aspect of the evolutionary process\". Others have criticized Reid's unorthodox views on emergence and evolution. Biologist Samuel Scheiner stated that Reid's \"presentation is both a caricature of evolutionary theory and severely out of date.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3867355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3867355", "title": "Fulminant", "text": "Fulminant\n\nFulminant () is a descriptor for any event or process that occurs suddenly and escalates quickly, and is intense and severe to the point of lethality, i.e., it has an explosive character. The word comes from Latin \"fulmināre\", to strike with lightning. Its most frequent uses are those in the field of medicine, and there are several diseases described by this adjective:\n\n\nSome viral hemorrhagic fevers, such as Ebola, Lassa fever, and Lábrea fever, may kill in as little as two to five days. Diseases that cause rapidly developing lung edema, such as some kinds of pneumonia, may kill in a few hours. It was said of the \"black death\" (pneumonic bubonic plague) that some of its victims would die in a matter of hours after the initial symptoms appeared. Other pathologic conditions that may be fulminating in character are acute respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, acute anaphylaxis, septic shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\nThe most rapid deaths are those provoked by massive body trauma, such as explosion injuries, airplane crashes, falling from a significant height, or industrial machinery incidents. Other examples include \"Commotio cordis\", a sudden cardiac arrest caused by a blunt, non-penetrating trauma to the precordium, which causes ventricular fibrillation of the heart. Cardiac arrest and stroke in certain parts of the brain, such as in the brainstem (which controls cardiovascular and respiratory system functions), and massive hemorrhage of the great arteries (such as in perforation of the walls by trauma or by sudden opening of an aneurysm of the aorta) may be very quick, with death ensuing in less than one minute. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is still a mysterious cause of respiratory arrest in infants. Certain infections of the brain, such as rabies, meningococcal meningitis, or primary amebic meningoencephalitis can kill within hours to days after symptoms appear.\n\nSome toxins, such as cyanide, may also provoke fulminant death. Abrupt hyperkalemia provoked by intravenous injection of potassium chloride leads to fulminant death by cardiac arrest.\n\n"}
{"id": "978997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=978997", "title": "Gilead Sciences", "text": "Gilead Sciences\n\nGilead Sciences, Inc., commonly known as Gilead Sciences or Gilead (also styled GILEAD), is an American biotechnology company that researches, develops and commercializes drugs. The company focuses primarily on antiviral drugs used in the treatment of HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and influenza, including Harvoni and Sovaldi.\n\nHeadquartered and founded in Foster City, California, Gilead is a member of the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index and the S&P 500.\n\nGilead Sciences was founded in June 1987 by Michael L. Riordan, a medical doctor who was 29 years old at the time. Riordan graduated from Washington University in St. Louis, the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Harvard Business School. Three core scientific advisers worked with Riordan to create the company and establish its scientific vision. These were Peter Dervan of Caltech, Doug Melton of Harvard, and Harold Weintraub of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Riordan served as CEO from inception until 1996. Menlo Ventures, a venture capital firm where Riordan worked for a year, made the first investment in Gilead, of $2 million, and Menlo's partner DuBose Montgomery served as Chairman of the Board until 1993, when Riordan became Chairman. Riordan also recruited as scientific advisers Harold Varmus, a Nobel laureate who later became Director of the National Institutes of Health, and Jack Szostak, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2009.\nThe company's primary therapeutic focus was, and continues to be, in antiviral medicines, a field that interested Riordan because he contracted dengue fever, an untreatable viral disease, while working in malnutrition clinics as a Henry Luce Scholar in the Philippines. Riordan recruited Donald Rumsfeld to join the board of directors in 1988, followed by Benno C. Schmidt, Sr., Gordon Moore, and George P. Shultz. Riordan tried to recruit Warren Buffett as an investor and board member, but was unsuccessful. Under the technical leadership of scientist Dr. Mark Matteucci, the company focused its early discovery research on making small strands of DNA (oligomers) to assess the potential of genetic code blockers (gene therapy). Its development of small molecule antiviral therapeutics began in 1991 when CEO Riordan and R&D head John C. Martin in-licensed a group of nucleotide compounds discovered in two European academic labs; one of the compounds was tenofovir, a pro-drug of which, trade named Viread, became one of the most widely used anti-retroviral drugs.\n\nIn 1990, Gilead entered into a collaborative research agreement with Glaxo for the research and development of genetic code blockers, also known as antisense. This collaboration was terminated in 1998, and Gilead's antisense intellectual property portfolio was sold to Ionis Pharmaceuticals. Gilead debuted on the NASDAQ in January 1992. Its initial public offering raised $86.25 million in proceeds.\n\nIn June 1996, Gilead launched Vistide (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS. The company cooperated with Pharmacia & Upjohn to market the product outside the United States.\n\nIn January 1997, Donald Rumsfeld, a Board member since 1988, was appointed Chairman, but left the Board in January 2001 when appointed United States Secretary of Defense at the start of George W. Bush's first term as President.\n\nIn March 1999, Gilead acquired NeXstar Pharmaceuticals of Boulder, Colorado following two years of negotiations with the company. At the time, NeXstar's annual sales of $130 million was three times Gilead's sales. NeXstar's two revenue-generating drugs were AmBisome, an injectable fungal treatment, and DaunoXome, an oncology drug taken by HIV patients. Also in 1999, Roche announced first approval of Tamiflu (oseltamivir) for the treatment of influenza. Tamiflu was originally discovered by Gilead and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing. Viread (tenofovir) achieved first approval in 2001 for the treatment of HIV.\n\nIn 2002 Gilead changed its corporate strategy to focus only on antivirals, and sold its cancer assets to OSI Pharmaceuticals for $200 million.\n\nIn December 2002, Gilead and Triangle Pharmaceuticals announced that Gilead would acquire Triangle for around $464 million; Triangle's lead drug was emtricitabine that was near FDA approval, and it had two other antivirals in its pipeline. The company also announced its first full year of profitability. Later that year Hepsera (adefovir) was approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, and Emtriva (emtricitabine) for the treatment of HIV.\n\nIn 2004, Gilead launched Truvada, a fixed-dose combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine.\n\nIn 2006, Gilead completed two acquisitions that allowed the company to branch out from its historical antiviral franchise into the cardiovascular and respiratory therapeutic arenas. Under an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, Myogen marketed Flolan (epoprostenol sodium) in the United States for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, Myogen was developing (in Phase 3 studies) darusentan, also an endothelin receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of resistant hypertension.\n\nIn 2006, the company acquired Corus Pharma, Inc. for $365 million. The acquisition of Corus signaled Gilead's entry into the respiratory arena. Corus was developing aztreonam lysine for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis who are infected with \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\". In July 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Atripla, a once a day single tablet regimen for HIV, combining Sustiva (efavirenz), a Bristol-Myers Squibb product, and Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil), a Gilead product. Gilead purchased Raylo Chemicals, Inc. in November 2006 for a price of $133.3 million. Raylo Chemical, based in Edmonton, Alberta, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Degussa AG, a German company. Raylo Chemical was a custom manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced intermediates for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Later in the same year Gilead acquired Myogen, Inc. for $2.5 billion (then its largest acquisition). With two drugs in development (ambrisentan and darusentan), and one marketed product (Flolan) for pulmonary diseases, the acquisition of Myogen has solidified Gilead's position in this therapeutic arena.\n\nGilead expanded its move into respiratory therapeutics in 2007 by entering into a licensing agreement with Parion for an epithelial sodium channel inhibitor for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, including cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis.\n\nIn 2009, the company acquired CV Therapeutics, Inc. for $1.4 billion, bringing Ranexa and Lexiscan into Gilead. Ranexa is a cardiovascular drug used to treat chest pain related to coronary artery disease, with both of these products and pipeline building out Gilead's cardiovascular franchise. Later, in the same year the company received the award for one of the Fastest Growing Companies by \"Fortune\". In the same year they were also named as one America's Top Companies to work for by \"Forbes\".\n\nIn 2010, the company acquired CGI Pharmaceuticals for $120 million, expanding Gilead's research expertise into kinase biology and chemistry. Later that year, the company acquired Arresto Biosciences, Inc. for $225 million, obtaining developmental-stage research for treating fibrotic diseases and cancer.\n\nIn 2011, the company acquired Calistoga Pharmaceuticals for $375 million ($225 million plus milestone payments). The acquisition boosted Gilead's oncology and inflammation areas. Later that year, Gilead made its most important acquisition — and most expensive to date — with the $10.4 billion purchase of Pharmasset, Inc. This transaction helped cement Gilead as the leader in treatment of the hepatitis C virus by giving it control of sofosbuvir (see below).\n\nOn July 16, 2012, the FDA approved Gilead's Truvada for prevention of HIV infection (it was already approved for treating HIV). The pill was a preventive measure (PrEP) for people at high risk of getting HIV through sexual activity.\n\nIn 2013, the company acquired YM Biosciences, Inc. for $510 million. The acquisition brings drug candidate CYT387, an orally-administered, once-daily, selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, specifically JAK1 and JAK2, into Gilead's oncology pipeline. The JAK enzymes have been implicated in myeloproliferative diseases, inflammatory disorders, and certain cancers.\n\nIn 2015, the company made a trio of acquisitions:\n\nIn 2016, the company acquired Nimbus Apollo, Inc. for $400 million, giving Gilead control of the compound NDI-010976 (an ACC inhibitor) and other preclinical ACC inhibitors for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and for the potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Also in 2016, the company was named the most generous company on the 2016 Fortune list of The Most Generous Companies of the Fortune 500. Charitable donations to HIV/AIDS and liver disease organizations totaled over 440 million in 2015.\n\nIn August 2017, the company announced it would acquire Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion, equating to $180 cash per share, a 29% premium over the closing price of the shares. The deal will add the promising CAR-T candidate to the companys existing portfolio. In November, the company announced it will acquire Cell Design Labs for up to $567 million, after it indirectly acquired a stake of 12.2% via the Kite Pharma deal. \n\nThe drug sofosbuvir had been part of the 2011 acquisition of Pharmasset. In 2013, the FDA approved this drug, under the trade name Sovaldi, as a treatment for the hepatitis C virus. \"Forbes\" magazine ranked Gilead its number 4 drug company, citing a market capitalization of US$113 billion and stock appreciation of 100%, and describing their 2011 purchase of Pharmasset for $11 billion as “one of the best pharma acquisitions ever”. Deutsche Bank estimated Sovaldi sales in the year's final quarter would be $53 million, and \"Barron's\" noted the FDA approval and subsequent strong sales of the “potentially revolutionary” drug as a positive indicator for the stock.\n\nOn July 11, 2014, the United States Senate Committee on Finance investigated Sovaldi's high price ($1,000 per pill; $84,000 for the full 12-week regimen). Senators questioned the extent to which the market was operating “efficiently and rationally”, and committee chairman Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and ranking minority member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote to CEO John C. Martin asking Gilead to justify the price for this drug. The committee hearings did not result in new law, but in 2014 and 2015, due to negotiated and mandated discounts, Sovaldi was sold well below the list price. For poorer countries, Gilead licensed multiple companies to produce generic versions of Sovaldi; in India, a pill's price was as low as $4.29.\n\nGilead later combined Sovaldi with other antivirals in single-pill combinations. First, Sovaldi was combined with ledipasvir and marketed as Harvoni. This treatment for hepatitis C cures the patient in 94% to 99% of cases (HCV genotype 1). By 2017, Gilead was reporting drastic drops in Sovaldi revenue from year to year, not only because of pricing pressure but because the number of suitable patients decreased. Later single-pill combinations were Epclusa (with velpatasvir) and Vosevi (with velpatasvir and voxilaprevir).\n\nFor the fiscal year 2017, Gilead Sciences Insurance reported earnings of US$4.628 billion, with an annual revenue of US$26.107 billion, a decline of 14.1% over the previous fiscal cycle. Gilead Sciences's shares traded at over $70 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US$93.4 billion in October 2018.\nAs of 2017, Gilead's challenge is to develop or acquire new blockbuster drugs before its current revenue-producers wane or their patent protection expires. Like other pharmaceutical companies, it stands to gain from efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to repeal taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, Gilead also benefitted from the expansion of Medicaid in the ACA; Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that Gilead's HIV drugs could face funding pressure under reform proposals. Gilead has $32 billion in cash, but $27.4 billion is outside the U.S. and is unavailable for acquisitions unless Gilead pays U.S. tax on it, though it could borrow against it. Gilead would benefit from proposals to let companies repatriate offshore capital with minimal further taxation.\n"}

Green Man first appeared in DC Comics' \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 2) # 164 (May 1983), and was created by writer Todd Klein and artist Dave Gibbons.\n\n\"Green Man\" is the adopted name of the Green Lantern from the Space Sector designated 2828 by the Green Lantern Corps. Uxorians frown upon individuality, and in Green Man’s own words, “On Uxor, all are one.” Green Man was a misfit who rebelled against his society’s anti-individualism, and longed for a personal identity. When the Guardians of the Universe offered him a position as a member of their Green Lantern Corps, Green Man jumped at the chance. One of the complications of this choice was that Green Man could never again legally enter his home star system, because of the pact the Guardians made with the Psions of Vega, which prohibits the Corps presence in that sector. Green Man's enlistment of the aid of the Omega Men in attacking the nestworld of a group of humanoid arachnids called the Spider Guild a few light years outside the Vega system resulted in a reprimand by the Guardians, which ultimately led to the Green Man quitting the Green Lantern Corps and joining the Omega Men. \n\nAs a member of the Omega Men, Green Man encountered many other beings in his adventures, such as the goddess X'Hal, who lived inside the star Vega; the whale-like Viathans; the Psions, who performed experiments on Green Man when he was brought to their research center, Wombworld; the Tamarans, and others. The Green Man was killed by Durlans in the \"Invasion!\" mini-series when the Omega Men were attacked by a coalition of aliens who were eliminating any opposition, including members of the then-disbanded Green Lantern Corps. \n\nIn the non-canonical \"Green Lantern Versus Aliens\" Green Man assists in placing the titular aliens on the planet Mogo. \n\nA second Uxorian also known as Green Man is partnered with the robot Stel, the Green Lantern of the planet Grenda, in Sector 3009, as seen in the miniseries \"Green Lantern Corps: Recharge\". Green Man is one of the Lanterns who participated in the defense of Oa against the onslaught of Superboy-Prime, as depicted in \"Infinite Crisis\" #7. Showing remorse over the apparent death of his partner, Green Man searched for Stel, and found him badly damaged, but functioning. The two then retreated to Mogo to ready themselves physically and mentally for the attacking Sinestro Corps.\n\nFollowing the Sinestro Corps War, the Guardians of the Universe established a new unit within the ranks of the Green Lantern Corps to uphold the Ten New Laws of the Book of Oa. This unit became known as the Alpha Lantern Corps. Green Man has been confirmed as a member of the Alpha Lanterns. He is later shown in \"Final Crisis\" #1. He appears again in issue #5, during Hal Jordan's trial and the subsequent events that clarify fellow Alpha Lantern Kraken is possessed by Granny Goodness.\n\nAs part of DC's \"Brightest Day\" storyline, Cyborg Superman hijacked the Alpha Lantern Corps. After he was defeated and the Alphas freed from his control, Ganthet managed to restore their emotions, including Green Man's. During the War of the Green Lanterns storyline, Alpha Lantern Varix felt that all the Alphas had become dangerously mentally unstable. He caused a reaction which killed all the Alpha Lanterns. \n\nThe Green Man, after being stripped of his ring and lantern by the Guardians, demonstrated an ability to produce a portal which he could hear and see though and use to transport himself. He was also able to pick up on the brainwaves of others in a form of telepathy. \nAfter becoming a cyborg, Green Man has no more need for sleeping, resting or eating. Fully powered by his internal power battery, Green Man is mainlined to the Central Battery and the Book of Oa.\n\nUxorians possess a deadly nerve toxin in their blood stream, which acts as a defense mechanism against predators. Uxorians are also amphibious. Upon his induction in the Alpha Lanterns Corps he is turned into a cyborg, fully covered with metallic plates. He carries a power battery embedded into his chest, no longer needing to recharge his ring from an external source, and a secondary face under his faceplate able to drain power rings, like the Manhunters have.\n\nGreen Man is one of the Green Lanterns who appear in the animated film \"\" fighting Sinestro.\n\nGreen Man also appears in a cameo in the \"Green Lantern\" live-action film. His appearance in the film differs to some extent from the comics, as he is shown as less humanoid, although his design retains his more prominent features from the comics, such as his spotted green skin, the mask and robust frame. He is also part of the film toyline.\n\n"}

{"id": "2890996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2890996", "title": "Inbreeding depression", "text": "Inbreeding depression\n\nInbreeding depression is the reduced biological fitness in a given population as a result of inbreeding, or breeding of related individuals. Population biological fitness refers to an organism's ability to survive and perpetuate its genetic material. Inbreeding depression is often the result of a population bottleneck. In general, the higher the genetic variation or gene pool within a breeding population, the less likely it is to suffer from inbreeding depression.\n\nInbreeding depression seems to be present in most groups of organisms, but varies across mating systems. Hermaphroditic species often exhibit lower degrees of inbreeding depression than outcrossing species, as repeated generations of selfing is thought to purge deleterious alleles from populations. For example, the outcrossing nematode (roundworm) \"Caenorhabditis remanei\" has been demonstrated to suffer severely from inbreeding depression, unlike its hermaphroditic relative \"C. elegans\", which experiences outbreeding depression.\n\nInbreeding (i.e., breeding between closely related individuals) results in more recessive traits manifesting themselves, as the genomes of pair-mates are more similar. Recessive traits can only occur in an offspring if present in both parents' genomes. The more genetically similar the parents are, the more often recessive traits appear in their offspring. Consequently, the more closely related the breeding pair is, the more homozygous, deleterious genes the offspring may have, resulting in very unfit individuals. For alleles that confer an advantage in the heterozygous and/or homozygous-dominant state, the fitness of the homozygous-recessive state may even be zero (meaning sterile or unviable offspring).\n\nAn example of inbreeding depression is shown to the right. In this case, \"a\" is the recessive allele which has negative effects. In order for the \"a\" phenotype to become active, the gene must end up as homozygous \"aa\" because in the geneotype A\"a\", the A takes dominance over the \"a\" and the \"a\" does not have any effect. Due to their reduced phenotypic expression and their consequent reduced selection, recessive genes are, more often than not, detrimental phenotypes by causing the organism to be less fit to its natural environment.\n\nAnother mechanism responsible for inbreeding depression is the fitness advantage of heterozygosity, which is known as overdominance. This can lead to reduced fitness of a population with many homozygous genotypes, even if they are not deleterious or recessive. Here, even the dominant alleles result in reduced fitness if present homozygously (see also hybrid vigour).\n\nCurrently, it is not known which of the two mechanisms is more prevalent in nature. For practical applications, e.g. in livestock breeding, the former is thought to be more significant – it may yield completely unviable offspring (meaning outright failure of a pedigree), while the latter can only result in relatively reduced fitness.\n\nNatural selection cannot effectively remove all deleterious recessive genes from a population for several reasons. First, deleterious genes arise constantly through mutation within a population. Second, in a population where inbreeding occurs frequently, most offspring will have some deleterious traits, so few will be more fit for survival than the others. Different deleterious traits are extremely unlikely to equally affect reproduction – an especially disadvantageous recessive trait expressed in a homozygous recessive individual is likely to eliminate itself, naturally limiting the expression of its phenotype. Third, recessive deleterious alleles will be \"masked\" by heterozygosity, and so in a dominant-recessive trait, heterozygotes will not be selected against.\n\nWhen recessive deleterious alleles occur in the heterozygous state, where their potentially deleterious expression is masked by the corresponding wild-type allele, this masking phenomenon is referred to as complementation (see complementation (genetics)).\n\nIn general, sexual reproduction in eukaryotes has two fundamental aspects: recombination during meiosis, and outcrossing. It has been proposed that these two aspects have two natural selective advantages respectively. A proposed adaptive advantage of meiosis is that it facilitates recombinational repair of DNA damages that are otherwise difficult to repair (see DNA repair as the adaptive advantage of meiosis). A proposed adaptive advantage of outcrossing is complementation, which is the masking of deleterious recessive alleles (see hybrid vigor or heterosis). The selective advantage of complementation may largely account for the general avoidance of inbreeding (see kin recognition).\n\nIntroducing alleles from a different population can reverse inbreeding depression. Different populations of the same species have different deleterious traits, and therefore their cross breeding will not result in homozygosity at most loci in the offspring. This is known as outbreeding enhancement, practiced by conservation managers and zoo captive breeders to prevent homozygosity.\n\nHowever, intermixing two different populations can give rise to unfit polygenic traits in outbreeding depression (i.e. yielding offspring which lack the genetic adaptations to specific environmental conditions). These, then, will have a lowered fitness than pure-bred individuals of a particular subspecies that has adapted to its local environment.\n\nThe biological effects of inbreeding depression in humans are largely obscured by socioeconomic and cultural influences on reproductive behavior. Studies in human populations have shown that age at marriage, duration of marriage, illiteracy, contraceptive use, and reproductive compensation are the major determinants of apparent fertility, even amongst populations with a high proportion of consanguinous unions. However, several small effects on increased mortality, longer inter-birth intervals and reduced overall productivity have been noted in certain isolated populations.\n\nCharles Darwin was one of the first scientists to demonstrate the effects of inbreeding depression, through numerous experiments on plants. Darwin's wife, Emma, was his first cousin, and he was concerned about the impact of inbreeding on his ten children, three of whom died at age ten or younger; three others had childless long-term marriages.\n\nWhilst inbreeding depression has been found to occur in almost all sufficiently studied species, some taxa, most notably some angiosperms, appear to suffer lower fitness costs than others in inbred populations. Three mechanisms appear to be responsible for this: purging, differences in ploidy, and selection for heterozygosity. It must be cautioned that some studies failing to show an absence of inbreeding depression in certain species can arise from small sample sizes or where the supposedly outbred control group is already suffering inbreeding depression, which frequently occurs in populations that have undergone a recent bottleneck, such as those of the naked mole rat.\n\nPurging selection occurs where the phenotypes of deleterious recessive alleles are exposed through inbreeding, and thus can be selected against. This can lead to such detrimental mutations being removed from the population, and has been demonstrated to occur rapidly where the recessive alleles have a lethal effect. The efficiency of purging will depend on the relationship between the magnitude of the deleterious effect that is unmasked in the homozygotes and the importance of genetic drift, so that purging is weaker for non-lethal than for recessive lethal alleles. For very small populations, drift has a strong influence, which can cause the fixation of sublethal alleles under weak selection. The fixation of a single allele for a specific gene can also reduce fitness where heterozygote advantage was previously present (i.e., where heterozygous individuals have higher fitness than homozygotes of either allele), although this phenomenon seems to make a usually small contribution to inbreeding depression. Although naturally occurring, purging can be important for population survival, deliberately attempting to purge deleterious mutations from a population is not generally recommended as a technique to improve the fitness of captive bred animals.\n\nMany angiosperms (flowering plants) can self-fertilise for several generations and suffer little from inbreeding depression. This is very useful for species which disperse widely and can therefore find themselves growing in a novel environment with no conspecifics present. Polyploidy (having more than two paired sets of each chromosome), which is prevalent in angiosperms, ferns and a select few animal taxa, accounts for this. By having several copies of a chromosome, as opposed to two, homozygosity is less likely to occur in inbred offspring. This means that recessive deleterious alleles are not expressed as frequently as with many copies of a chromosome; it is more likely that at least one will contain a functional allele.\n\nInbreeding depression has also been found to occur more gradually than predicted in some wild populations, such as in the highly inbred population of Scandinavian wolves. This appears to be due to a selection pressure for more heterozygous individuals, which generally are in better condition and so are more likely to become one of the few animals to breed and produce offspring.\n\n\n"}

Rozhetskin was part of a group that founded Renaissance Capital, Russia's first investment bank, in partnership with Boris Jordan, an American of Russian origin, and New Zealander Stephen Jennings.\n\nRozhetskin \"amassed his fortune in the mobile phone industry during Russia's privatisation of telecom companies.\" In 1998, Rozhetskin left Renaissance Capital to co-found the independent venture capital firm LV Finance. With help from Leonid Reiman, LV Finance secured 25% of MegaFon at the time Reiman was Russia's telecommunications minister. In 2003, Rozhetskin sold the MegaFon stake to Alfa Group.\n\nFrom October 2001 until January 2005, Rozhetskin served as Executive Vice Chairman of Norilsk Nickel, Russia's largest mining company and the world's largest miner of nickel and palladium metals. Rozhetskin was also a board member and founding shareholder of \"City A.M.\", London's first free daily business newspaper.\n\nRozhetskin founded a production company called L + E Productions with Eric Eisner, son of former Disney executive Michael Eisner. Through L + E Productions, he was credited as a producer of \"Hamlet 2\"; he was also credited as an executive producer of the 2009 film \"Boogie Woogie\".\n\nRozhetskin married model Natalya Belova, who gave birth to their son in 2005. According to \"The Sunday Times\" (and other sources), Rozhetskin's friends suspected he lived a closeted life, prompted by what the newspaper called Russia's \"machismo and deep-seated homophobia\"; the \"extraordinary lengths to [he went to] conceal his homosexuality included withholding the truth on the subject from his mother, who characterized claims of her son's homosexuality as a \"smear campaign.\"\n\nRozhetskin was last seen on the night of his disappearance by two men who were picked up at his villa by a taxi that took them to a club called XXL, Riga's largest gay nightclub. Many Western media sources quickly assumed he was dead, although the Russian press claimed he was living in California under the Federal Witness Protection Program.\n\nIn 2012, a body found in a forest near Tukums was that of Rozhetskin, according to preliminary DNA tests; these findings were confirmed in November 2013.\n"}

{"id": "84952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84952", "title": "Marvelous Marvin Hagler", "text": "Marvelous Marvin Hagler\n\nMarvelous Marvin Hagler (born Marvin Nathaniel Hagler; May 23, 1954) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1973 to 1987. He reigned as the undisputed middleweight champion from 1980 to 1987, making twelve defenses of that title, and currently holds the highest knockout percentage of all undisputed middleweight champions, at 78%, while also holding the second longest unified championship reign in boxing history at twelve consecutive defenses. At six years and seven months, his reign as undisputed middleweight champion is the second longest of the last century, behind only Tony Zale, who reigned during World War II. In 1982, annoyed that network announcers often did not refer to him by his nickname, \"Marvelous\", Hagler legally changed his name to Marvelous Marvin Hagler.\n\nHagler is an inductee of the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame. He was named Fighter of the Decade (1980s) by \"Boxing Illustrated\" magazine, and twice named Fighter of the Year by \"The Ring\" magazine and the Boxing Writers Association of America. In 2001 and 2004, \"The Ring\" named him the fourth greatest middleweight of all time and in 2002 named him the 17th greatest fighter of the past 80 years. The International Boxing Research Organization rates Hagler as the 6th greatest middleweight of all time, while BoxRec rates him the 12th greatest boxer of all time, pound for pound; and the 4th best middleweight of all time. Many analysts and boxing writers consider Hagler to have one of the most durable chins in boxing history.\n\nHagler spent his early years in Newark, New Jersey's Central Ward. Following the Newark Riots of July 12–17, 1967, in which 26 people were killed and $11 million in property damage was caused, including the destruction of the Hagler family's tenement, the Haglers moved to Brockton, Massachusetts. In 1969, Hagler took up boxing after walking into a gym owned by brothers Pat and Goody Petronelli, who became his trainers and managers. In 1973, Hagler won the National AAU 165-pound title after defeating Atlanta's Terry Dobbs.\n\nHagler was a top-ranked middleweight boxer for many years before he could fight for the title. Hagler struggled to find high-profile opponents willing to face him in his early years. Joe Frazier told Hagler, 'You have three strikes against you, \"You're black, you're a southpaw, and you're good.' He often had to travel to his opponents' hometowns to get fights. His first break came when he was offered --on two weeks' notice-- a chance against Willie 'the Worm' Monroe, who was being trained by Frazier. Hagler lost the decision but the fight was close, so Monroe gave him a rematch. This time Hagler knocked out Monroe in 12 rounds. In a third fight, he stopped Monroe in two rounds.\n\nBoston promoter Rip Valenti took an interest in Hagler and began bringing in top ranked opponents for Hagler to face. He fought 1972 Olympics gold medalist Sugar Ray Seales; Hagler won the first time, the second was a draw and Hagler knocked out Seales in the third fight. Number 1 ranked Mike Colbert was knocked out in the twelfth and also had his jaw broken by Hagler. Briton Kevin Finnegan was stopped in eight. Afterwards Finnegan required 40 stitches in his face. He dropped a controversial decision to Bobby 'Boogaloo' Watts, but knocked out Watts in two rounds in a rematch. Hagler won a ten-round decision over 'Bad' Bennie Briscoe. By then, promoter Bob Arum took notice and signed him.\n\nIn November 1979, Hagler fought World Middleweight Champion Vito Antuofermo at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. After fifteen rounds, most thought that Hagler had won. Hagler claimed the ref said he won, but the ref denied ever saying it. Hagler claimed he and many others were surprised when the decision was announced as a draw and Antuofermo retained his title. This only added to Hagler's frustrations. Hagler had the boxing skills and killer instinct to knock Vito out, but instead he played it safe and it cost him the title.\n\nAntuofermo lost his title later to British boxer Alan Minter, who gave Hagler his second title shot. Hagler went to Wembley Arena to face Minter. The tense atmosphere was stoked further when Minter was quoted as saying that \"No black man is going to take my title\"—Minter would later insist he meant \"\"that\" black man\". Hagler took command and his slashing punches soon opened up the cut-prone Minter. With Hagler dominating the action, referee Carlos Berrocal halted the fight during the third round to have the four glaring cuts on Minter's face examined. Minter's manager, Doug Bidwell, almost immediately conceded defeat. Once Berrocal waved the bout off, a riot broke out among the spectators. Clive Gammon of Sports Illustrated described the scene as \"a horrifying ululation of howls and boos.\" Hagler and his trainers had to be escorted to their locker room by a phalanx of policemen, all the while enduring a steady rain of beer bottles and glasses. After seven years and 50 fights, Hagler was the World Middleweight Champion.\n\nHagler proved a busy world champion. He defeated future world champion Fulgencio Obelmejias of Venezuela by a knockout in eight rounds and then former world champ Antuofermo in a rematch by TKO in four rounds. Both matches were fought at the Boston Garden near Hagler's hometown, endearing him to Boston fight fans. Syrian born Mustafa Hamsho, who won his shot in an eliminator with Wilfred Benítez and would later defeat future world champion Bobby Czyz, became Hagler's next challenger, put up a lot of resistance but was finally beaten in 11 tough rounds. Michigan fighter William \"Caveman\" Lee lasted only one round, and in a rematch in Italy, Obelmejias lasted five rounds. British Champion (and mutual Alan Minter conqueror) Tony Sibson followed in Hagler's ever-growing list of unsuccessful challengers. Sibson provided one of the most entertaining (to this point) fights of Marvelous Marvin's career, but he ultimately fell short, lasting six rounds. Next, came Wilford Scypion, who only lasted four. By then, Hagler was a staple on HBO, the Pay Per View of its time.\n\nA fight against Roberto Durán followed. Durán was the first challenger to last the distance with Hagler in a world-championship bout. Durán was the WBA Light Middleweight Champion and went up in weight to challenge for Hagler's middleweight crown. Hagler won a unanimous 15-round decision, although after 13 rounds, Duran was ahead by one point on two scorecards and even on the third. Hagler, with his left eye swollen and cut, came on strong in the last two rounds to win the fight.\n\nThen came Juan Roldán of Argentina, who became the only man to be credited with a knockdown of Hagler, scoring one knockdown seconds into the fight – which was clearly a slip to anyone who saw it. Hagler protested bitterly that he had been pulled/pushed to the canvas. Hagler cut Roldan's left eye, then brutalized him over ten rounds and stopping him in the middle of round ten. Sugar Ray Leonard was calling the fight ringside with HBO analyst Barry Tompkins. He noted to Tompkins between rounds that Hagler looked older and slower. \"Marvin might finally be slowing down, Barry\" Leonard remarked. Many people believe this is the fight that gave Sugar Ray Leonard the idea that he could actually win a fight with the aging Hagler.\nHamsho was given a rematch, but the Syrian was again TKO'd, this time in only three rounds. Hamsho angered Hagler with a trio of intentional headbutts in the second round and a fourth early in the third, goading the normally patient and cautious Hagler into a full-out attack that left Hamsho battered and defenseless in a matter of seconds.\n\nOn April 15, 1985, Hagler and Thomas Hearns met in what was billed as The Fight; later it would become known as \"The War.\" \nRound One: Three minutes of blistering violence. Within the first fifteen seconds, Hearns lands his best punch, a straight right, onto Hagler's chin. The champion steps back, then comes forward. At this point, Hagler begins to walk through Tommy's power punches.\nRound Two: Hagler is cut on his head from an unintentional elbow or headbutt. Despite the blood, the champion continues to now push the fight forward. Hearns is fighting hurt as well, having suffered a broken right hand in the last minute of the first round. The pace continues as before, but now Hearns is backing up, trying to move around the ring. Hearns' trainer Manny Stewart would later reveal Hearns had a leg massage, much to his dismay, before the fight. Tommy's legs by the end of the round are weakening.\nRound Three: The pace slows until Referee Richard Steele calls a time out to have the ringside doctor examine the cut on Hagler's head. The crowd is on its feet for the next ten seconds, before the doctor allows the fight to continue. Hagler charges the much taller Hearns, drilling in an overhand right behind Tommy's ear. Hearns' legs wobble, and Hagler is on him quickly. Tommy topples to the canvas, rising at the count of eight, but collapses into Referee Steele's arms. The fight is then halted.\n\nThe fight only lasted eight minutes and one second, but it is rightly regarded as a classic. Commentator Al Michaels uttered the now-immortal line, \"It didn't go very far, but it was a beauty!\" The fight was named \"Fight of the Year\" by \"The Ring\".\n\nNext was Olympic silver medalist John Mugabi of Uganda, who was 25–0 with 25 knockouts and was ranked the number one contender by all three major bodies. The fight took place on March 10, 1986 as Hagler had hurt his back and could not fight on the first date booked in 1985. Hagler stopped Mugabi in the 11th round of a brutal fight. Many ringside observers, including analyst Gil Clancy, noticed that Hagler was showing signs of advanced ring wear and age. He was much slower of hand and foot and seemed much easier to hit. He had also completely morphed his ring style from a slick, quick-fisted, boxer/puncher to a strictly flat-footed, stalking, slugger to compensate for his loss of speed and reflexes. Hagler was now said to be seriously considering retirement. Hagler's promoter Bob Arum was quoted as saying he was expecting Hagler to retire in the face of being challenged by Sugar Ray Leonard.\n\nHagler's next challenger was Sugar Ray Leonard, who was returning to the ring after a three-year retirement (having fought just once in the previous five years.) During the pre-fight negotiations, in return for granting Hagler a larger share of the purse Leonard obtained several conditions which would be crucial to his strategy; a 22x22ft ring, 12oz gloves and the fight was to be over 12—not 15—rounds. Leonard was 2 years younger, had half as many fights, and unbeknownst to Hagler, had engaged in several 'real' fights behind closed doors (i.e. gloves, rounds, a referee, judges and no head gear) in order to shake off his ring rust. The fight took place at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on April 6, 1987. Hagler was the betting favorite.\n\nHagler, a natural southpaw, opened the fight boxing out of an orthodox stance. After the quick and slick Leonard won the first two rounds on all three scorecards, Hagler started the third round as a southpaw. Hagler did better, though Leonard's superior speed and boxing skill kept him in the fight. But by the fifth, Leonard, who was moving a lot, began to tire and Hagler started to get closer. As he tired Leonard began to clinch with more frequency (in total referee Richard Steele gave him over 30 warnings for holding, although never deducted a point). Hagler buckled Leonard's knees with a right uppercut near the end of the round, which finished with Leonard on the ropes. Hagler continued to score effectively in round six. Leonard, having slowed down, was obliged to fight more and run less.\n\nIn rounds seven and eight, Hagler's southpaw jab was landing solidly and Leonard's counter flurries were less frequent. Round nine was the most exciting round of the fight. Hagler hurt Leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner. Leonard was in trouble, then furiously tried to fight his way out of the corner. The action see-sawed back and forth for the rest of the round, with each man having his moments. Round ten was tame by comparison, as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round. Clearly tiring, Leonard boxed well in the eleventh. Every time Hagler scored, Leonard came back with something flashier, if not as effective. In the final round, Hagler continued to chase Leonard. He hit Leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner. Leonard responded with a flurry and danced away with Hagler in pursuit. The fight ended with Hagler and Leonard exchanging along the ropes. Hagler began dancing in celebration of his performance while Leonard alternately collapsed to the canvas and raised both his arms in triumph. Leonard threw 629 punches and landed 306, while Hagler threw 792 and landed 291.\n\nHagler later said that, as the fighters embraced in the ring after the fight, Leonard said to him, \"You beat me man\". Hagler said after the fight, \"He said I beat him and I was so happy\". Leonard denied making the statement and claimed he only told Hagler, \"You're a great champion\". HBO cameras and microphones supported Hagler's version of events.\n\nLeonard was announced as winner by split decision, which remains hotly disputed to this day.\n\nOfficial ringside judge JoJo Guerra, whose 118–110 scorecard was derided in many quarters, commented that:\n\nJudge Dave Moretti, who scored it 115–113 for Leonard:\n\nLou Filippo, who scored it 115–113 for Hagler and felt that Hagler's bodyshots and aggression earned him the nod, said:\n\nHugh McIlvanney, commenting in the British \"Sunday Times\" and \"Sports Illustrated\":\n\nMcIlvanny also referred to Budd Schulberg's contention about a 'compound optical illusion', namely that simply being more competitive than expected meant that Leonard appeared more effective and to be doing more than he actually was. Harry Gibbs, the British judge who ironically had been rejected by the Hagler camp, said he also scored it for Hagler.\n\nJim Murray, long-time sports columnist for the \"Los Angeles Times\" felt that Leonard deservedly got the decision, arguing that Leonard landed more punches and showed better defense and ring generalship, and writing:\n\nThe scorecards from the ringside press attest to the closeness of the fight (6–5, 3 drawn) more pundits awarded the fight to Leonard rather than to Hagler, although counting those who scored it even, more felt Hagler deserved to keep his title than did not:\n\nHagler requested a rematch but Leonard chose to retire again (the third of five high-profile retirements announced by Leonard), having said he would do so beforehand. Hagler himself retired from boxing in June 1988, declaring that he was \"tired of waiting\" for Leonard to grant him a rematch. In 1990, Leonard finally offered Hagler a rematch which reportedly would have earned him $15m, but he declined. By then he had settled down to a new life as an actor in Italy and was now uninterested in boxing. He said \"A while ago, yeah, I wanted him so bad, but I'm over that.\" At the 1994 Consumer Electronics Show Hagler and Leonard had a mock rematch by playing against each other in the video game \"Boxing Legends of the Ring\", and claimed that an actual rematch was being planned.\n\nHagler had a unique training regimen in which he would hole up on Cape Cod in motels that had closed for the winter. For his \"road work\" he would take to the pavement in army boots, declaring running shoes \"sissy shoes.\" He would run much of his route backwards to prepare for movements in the boxing ring.\n\nAfter the loss to Leonard, Hagler moved to Italy, where he became a well-known star of action films. His roles include a US Marine in the films \"Indio\" and \"\". In 1996, he starred alongside Giselle Blondet in \"Virtual Weapon\". Hagler has provided boxing commentary for British television. Another foray into the entertainment field includes work in the video game \"\".\n\nFormer middleweight southpaw boxer Robbie Sims is Hagler's brother. Hagler has five children with his first wife, Bertha: Charelle, Celeste, James, Marvin Jr., and Gentry. Although he owns a home in Bartlett, New Hampshire, Hagler currently lives in Milan. In May 2000, he married his second wife Kay, an Italian woman, in Pioltello, Italy.\n\n\n\n"}

Halberstam's younger brother was the award-winning journalist and historian David Halberstam. \n\nHalberstam attended Harvard College, where he was managing editor of \"The Harvard Crimson\" (as his brother David would also be) and won the Dana Reed Prize for the best piece of writing published in a Harvard student publication. Halberstam earned an A.B. in History with honors from Harvard in 1953 and earned a M.D. from the Boston University School of Medicine in 1957.\n\nHalberstam served in the U.S. Public Health Service, then completed his internship and residency in New York City and Burlington, Vermont. In 1962 Halberstam became a fellow in cardiology at George Washington University Hospital and later taught at the university's medical school. Halberstam established a private practice in 1964.\n\nIn addition to medical papers in his field, Halberstam wrote on topics including Medicare and litigation against physicians, as well as television reviews of medical shows like \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\" In 1978 Halberstam wrote a novel, \"The Wanting of Levine\", about a self-made millionaire real estate investor who becomes the first Jewish U.S. President.

This was possible by decoding signals of hundreds of neurons recorded in volitional areas of the cerebral cortex while the monkey played with a hand-held joystick to move a shape in a video game. These signals were sent to the robot arm, which then mimicked the monkey's movements and thus controlled the game. After a while the monkey realised that thinking about moving the shape was enough and it no longer needed to move the joystick. So it let go of the joystick and controlled the game purely through thought. A system in which brain signals directly control an artificial actuator is commonly referred to as brain-machine interface or brain-computer interface.\n\nOn January 15, 2008, Dr. Nicolelis lab saw a monkey implanted with a new BCI successfully control a robot walking on a treadmill in Kyoto, Japan. The monkey could see the robot, named CB, on a screen in front of him, and was rewarded for walking in sync with the robot (which was under the control of the monkey). After an hour the monkey's treadmill was turned off, but he was able to continue to direct the robot to walk normally for another few minutes, indicating that a part of the brain not sufficient to induce a motor response in the monkey had become dedicated to controlling the robot, as if it were an extension of itself.\n\nNicolelis is a co-founder and scientific director of the Edmond and Lily Safra International Institute for Neuroscience of Natal, a brain research facility in Brazil.\n\nOn August 3, 2010, Nicolelis was awarded an NIH Director's Pioneer Award to continue his research on brain-machine interface technology. On January 5, 2011, Dr. Nicolelis was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI as an ordinary member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.\n\nNicolelis is a fan of Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, a Brazilian football club; a football ball with Palmeiras crest can be seen at his website. He is currently working on a project that allowed paraplegic Juliano Pinto, a 29-year-old with complete paralysis of the lower trunk to deliver the kickoff at the opening game of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, in Brazil.\n\nIn 2013 a report of research by Nicolelis and others was published which showed brain to brain communication between two rats using brain–computer interfaces. This result may demonstrate the feasibility of a biological computer consisting of a network of animal, or human, brains. Currently, researchers are divided on their views of this research. Critics state that there are flaws in the scientific methods used and that there is lack of controls. They claim that some of the scientific claims are rendered \"far-fetched at best.\" One researcher stated the work was similar to a \"poor Hollywood science fiction script.\" Proponents have praised this research for drawing attention to Brain to Brain Interfaces as a way of studying neural systems: “The study helps to promote the role of BMIs not only in prosthetic applications, but also as scientific tools. It's a contribution to that.” Ron Frostig, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine, has described this brain to brain work as \"an amazing paper” and a “beautiful proof of principle” that information can be transferred from one brain to another in real time.\n\n\n"}

When \"A\"s will is executed, under a distribution \"per stirpes\", \"C\" and \"D\" each receive one-third of the estate, and \"B1\" and \"B2\" each receive one-sixth. \"B1\" and \"B2\" constitute one \"branch\" of the family, and collectively receive a share equal to the shares received by \"C\" and \"D\" as branches (figure 1).\n\nExample 1B: If grandchild \"B1\" had predeceased \"A\", leaving two children \"B1a\" and \"B1b\", and grandchild \"B2\" had also died leaving three children \"B2a\", \"B2b\" and \"B2c\", then distribution \"per stirpes\" would give one-third each to \"C\" and \"D\", one-twelfth each to \"B1a\" and \"B1b\", who would constitute a branch, and one-eighteenth each to \"B2a\", \"B2b\" and \"B2c\". Thus, the \"B\", \"C\", and \"D\" branches receive equal shares of the whole estate, the \"B1\" and \"B2\" branches receive equal shares of the \"B\" branch's share, \"B1a\" and \"B1b\" receive equal shares of the \"B1\" branch's share, and \"B2a\", \"B2b\" and \"B2c\" receive equal shares of the \"B2\" branch's share.\n\nPer capita at each generation is an alternative way of distribution, where heirs of the same generation will each receive the same amount. The estate is divided into equal shares at the generation closest to the deceased with surviving heirs. The number of shares is equal to the number of original members either surviving or with surviving descendants. Each surviving heir of that generation gets a share. The remainder is then equally divided among the next-generation descendants of the deceased descendants in the same manner.\n\nExample 2A: In the first example, children \"C\" and \"D\" survive, so the estate is divided at their generation. There were three children, so each surviving child receives one-third. The remainder - \"B\"s share - is then divided in the same manner among \"B\"s surviving descendants. The result is the same as under \"per stirpes\" because \"B\"s one-third is distributed to \"B1\" and \"B2\" (one-sixth to each).\n\nExample 2B: The \"per capita\" and \"per stirpes\" results would differ if \"D\" also pre-deceased with one child, \"D1\" (figure 2). Under \"per stirpes\", \"B1\" and \"B2\" would each receive one-sixth (half of \"B\"s one-third share), and \"D1\" would receive one-third (all of \"D\"s one-third share). Under \"per capita\", the two-thirds remaining after \"C\" 's one-third share was taken would be divided equally among all three children of \"B\" and \"D\". (Two-thirds = six ninths) Each would receive two-ninths: \"B1\", \"B2\", and \"D1\" would all receive two-ninths.\n\n\"Notes:\"\n\nIn many U.S. states, such as New York, a statute has modified the \"per stirpes\" approach and utilizes instead a per capita with representation approach (also known as modern American per stirpes). Under the per capita with representation approach, the number of branches is determined by reference to the generation nearest the testator which has a surviving descendant. Thus, in the first example, if \"C\" and \"D\" also are already dead, and each left one child, named (respectively and appropriately) \"C1\" and \"D1\", then each of \"B1\", \"B2\", \"C1\" and \"D1\" would receive one quarter of the estate. This method is also utilized in the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah, and West Virginia.\n\n"}

She was born into the family of a serf smith by the name of Ivan Gorbunov (a.k.a. Kovalyov) probably on the estate of Voshchazhnikovo in the province of Yaroslavl. Praskovia and her family belonged to the Sheremetevs, one of the richest noble families in Russia at the time. As a young girl she moved with her family to the estate of Kuskovo outside Moscow. Soon thereafter she was taken from her family to serve as a chambermaid to Princess Martha Dolgorukaya, a relative of her master, Count Pyotr Sheremetev, who lived in the manor house.\n\nBlessed with a fine voice, Praskovia was trained to be a singer in the opera company then being put together by Count Pyotr and his son, Nikolai Sheremetev. She debuted in 1779 on the stage of the serf theatre at Kuskovo in the role of the servant Gubert in the comic opera \"L'Amitié à l'épreuve\" by André Grétry. Following her success, Praskovia was given the leading role of Belinda in Antonio Sacchini's opera \"La colonie\". In this 1780 performance the actress for the first time appeared under the stage name Zhemchugova, \"The Pearl\", (\"zhemchug\" means \"pearl\" in Russian). The other stars of the company were also given new names: Arina \"The Sapphire\", Fekla \"The Turquoise\", Tatyana \"The Garnet\", Nikolai \"The Marble\", Andrei \"The Flint\", etc.\n\nAfter the role of Belinda, Praskovia was promoted to the position of the first actress of the theatre. By the age of 17, she could read and write French and Italian fluently, played the harp and clavichord, and was acknowledged by her contemporaries for her operatic and dramatic abilities.\n\nIn a career that spanned almost two decades, Praskovia performed in over a dozen operas, including Monsigny's \"Le déserteur\" and \"Aline, reine de Golconde\", Paisiello's \"L'infante de Zamora\", Jean-Jacques Rousseau's \"Le Devin du village\", and Piccinni's \"La buona figliuola maritata\".\n\nHer most important role was Eliane in Grétry's opera \"Les Mariages samnites\". Assuming the part for the first time in 1785, Praskovia sang Eliane for 12 years — a first in the history of serf theatre. In 1787 Praskovia sang the role of Eliane at Kuskovo for Empress Catherine II and her suite. Catherine was so impressed by her performance that she requested to meet Praskovia and later gave her a diamond ring.\n\nIn the mid-1780s, Praskovya became the mistress of Count Nikolai Sheremetev. Nikolai was the impresario of the family serf theater, and he had helped train Praskovia over the years, eventually falling in love with the young star of the troupe. The circumstances surrounding the early years of their relationship, like so much of Praskovia's life, are unknown. After the death of Nikolai's father in 1788, Nikolai and Praskovia set up a private household in a secluded corner of the Kuskovo estate. Their unorthodox relationship soon became the subject of gossip among aristocratic society.\n\nIn 1795 Praskovia, Nikolai, and the theatre troupe moved from Kuskovo to Ostankino, a brilliant new palace constructed north of Moscow with a large theatre intended for large-scale operas and immense balls. The year 1795 was marked by the premiere of the opera \"Zelmira and Smeloy, or the Capture of Izmail\" (Osip Kozlovsky, text by Pavel Potemkin); Praskovia acted in the role of the captive Turkish woman Zelmira). Praskovia performed here for Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last king of Poland.\n\nAt the height of the theatre's flowering in the late 1790s Praskovia became ill, possibly with consumption (tuberculosis), and was forced to retire. In late 1796, Nikolai was appointed to the court of Paul I and Praskovia moved with him to St. Petersburg.\n\nAlthough they lived as man and wife, Nikolai and Praskovia had to keep the nature of their relationship secret from polite society. It was taboo for an aristocrat like Sheremetev to move about in society with a serf as his social equal. Finally, in 1798 Sheremetev emancipated Praskova and later the entire Kovalyov family from serfdom. Understanding that her health would not allow her to return to the stage, he closed the theatre.\n\nIn 1801 Nikolai and Praskovia married in Moscow in the strictest secrecy. As part of the arrangements, Nikolai had created a phony genealogy for Praskovia claiming that she was the long-lost descendant of a Polish nobleman by the name of Kovalevskii. Around the time of the wedding he sent a forger to Poland with a purse full of money to purchase a patent of nobility from a willing noble family.\n\nWithin months of their wedding Praskovia became pregnant. On February 3, 1803 she gave birth to a son, Dmitry, but pregnancy and childbirth destroyed her poor health and she died on February 23 at the Sheremetev palace in St. Petersburg. Just before she died Nikolai informed Emperor Alexander I of his marriage and requested official recognition, which he granted. News of the marriage scandalized society and angered Nikolai's family. Nikolai's two nephews, the Razumovsky brothers, had planned to inherit their uncle's vast fortune, and upon hearing that they were to lose it all to the son of a serf they contemplated murdering the infant.\n\nPraskovia was buried in an elaborate ceremony at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery attended by clergy and servants from the Sheremetev household. Nikolai was too overcome with grief to attend, and the nobility stayed away to signal its disapproval of Nikolai's marriage.\n\nIn memory of Praskovia Nikolai built in Moscow on Sukharevskaya square, a large almshouse that tended to the sick, poor, and orphaned up until the revolution of 1917. Under the Soviets the almshouse was shut down and replaced by a scientific research institute named after N. Sklifosovsky.\n\n\"The love affair between Count Sheremetyev and his serf actress set the rumour mill rolling with the high society really shocked to see the count to be so madly in love with his servant and even preparing to build a theatre for her in his Ostankino estate just north of Moscow. And still, this public criticism of his choice was really playing on the young count's nerves who realised all too clear that the society would never forgive him if he ever married the commoner girl. In the meantime, Praskovya the actress was making strides on stage and her theatre's fortnightly performances always played to a full house.\" (Lyubov Tsarevskaya Russian Culture).\n\nThe plaque on Praskovia's grave reads--\n\n\"This plain marble, unfeeling and impermanent,<br>\nHides the priceless remains of a wife and mother.<br>\nHer soul was a temple of virtue,<br>\nIn which peace, piety, and faith resided,<br>\nWhere pure love and friendship dwellt.<br>\nEven in her final hour she remained devoted,<br>\nFeeling the full grief of those she was leaving behind.<br>\nWhat is to become of her wretched spouse,<br>\nFated to drag out the rest of his days without his friend?<br>\nHis heart lives on nothing but barren sighs, wailing, sorrow, and heavy moans.<br>\nYet her death was the path to immortality,<br>\nHer innocent spirit is now in God's embrace,<br>\nRobed in the radiant cloak of imperishability,<br>\nAnd forever surrounded by the faces of angels.<br>\nFill this dwelling place with righteous blessings,<br>\nO God, and lay her pure soul to rest for all eternity.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "370782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=370782", "title": "Right to die", "text": "Right to die\n\nThe right to die is a concept based on the opinion that a human being is entitled to end their own life or to undergo voluntary euthanasia. Possession of this right is often understood to mean that a person with a terminal illness, or without the will to continue living, should be allowed to end their own life or to use assisted suicide or to decline life-prolonging treatment. The question of whom, if anyone, should be empowered to make this decision is often central to debate.\n\nSome academics and philosophers, such as David Benatar, consider humans to be overly optimistic in their view of the quality of their lives, and in their view of the balance between the positive and the negative aspects of living. This can be considered in terms of antinatalism and the lack of agency regarding one’s own birth and who should have authority over one’s choice to live or die.\n\nProponents typically associate the right to die with the idea that one's body and one's life are one's own, to dispose of as one sees fit. However, a legitimate state interest in preventing irrational suicides is sometimes argued. Pilpel and Amsel write: Contemporary proponents of \"rational suicide\" or the \"right to die\" usually demand by \"rationality\" that the decision to kill oneself be both the autonomous choice of the agent (i.e., not due to the physician or the family pressuring them to \"do the right thing\" and commit suicide) and a \"best option under the circumstances\" choice desired by the stoics or utilitarians, as well as other natural conditions such as the choice being stable, not an impulsive decision, not due to mental illness, achieved after due deliberation, etc.Hinduism accepts the right to die for those who are tormented by terminal diseases or those who have no desire, ambition or no responsibilities remaining; and allows death through the non-violent practice of fasting to the point of starvation (Prayopavesa). Jainism has a similar practice named \"Santhara\". Other religious views on suicide vary in their tolerance, and include denial of the right as well as condemnation of the act. In the Catholic faith, suicide is considered a grave sin.\n\nThere is a question in ethics as to whether or not a right to die can coexist with a right to life. If, it is argued, the right to life is inalienable, it cannot be surrendered, and therefore may be incompatible with a right to die. A second debate exists within bioethics over whether the right to die is universal, only applies under certain circumstances (such as terminal illness), or if it exists. It is also stated that 'right to live' is not synonymous to 'obligation to live'. From that point of view, the right to live can coexist with the right to die.\n\nA court in the American state of Montana, for example, has found that the right to die applies to those with life-threatening medical conditions. Suicide advocate Ludwig Minelli, euthanasia expert Sean W. Asher and bioethics professor Jacob M. Appel, in contrast, argue that \"all\" competent people have a right to end their own lives. Appel has suggested that the right to die is a test for the overall freedom of a given society. \n\nThe 1991 Patient Self-Determination Act passed by the US Congress at the request of the financial arm of Medicare does permit elderly Medicare/Medicaid patients (and by implication, all \"terminal\" patients) to prepare an advance directive in which they elect or choose to refuse life-extending and/or life-saving treatments as a means of shortening their lives to shorten their suffering unto certain death. The treatment refused in an advance directive under US law, because of the 1991 PSDA, does not have to be proved to be \"medically futile\" under some existing due-process procedure developed under state laws, such as TADA in Texas.\n\nAs of June 2016, some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal in Canada, Colombia, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.\n\nAs of August 2011 a British Columbia Supreme Court judge had been requested to speed up a right-to die lawsuit so that Gloria Taylor could have a doctor assist her in committing suicide. She suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease. She died of an infection in 2012.\n\nA British Columbia civil liberties lawsuit is representing six plaintiffs and challenges the laws that make it a criminal offence to assist seriously and incurably ill individuals to die with dignity.\n\nOn 6 February 2015 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that denying the right to assisted suicide is unconstitutional. The court’s ruling limits physician-assisted suicides to “a competent adult person who clearly consents to the termination of life and has a grievous and irremediable medical condition, including an illness, disease or disability, that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition.” The ruling was suspended for 12 months to allow the Canadian parliament to draft a new, constitutional law to replace the existing one.\n\nThe court decision includes a requirement that there must be stringent limits that are “scrupulously monitored.” This will require the death certificate to be completed by an independent medical examiner, not the treating physician, to ensure the accuracy of reporting the cause of death.\n\nThe Canadian Medical Association (CMA) reported that not all doctors were willing to help a patient die. However, the belief in late 2015 was that no physician would be forced to do so but the CMA was offering educational sessions to members as to the process that would be used.\n\nOn 17 June 2016, legislation passed both houses of the Parliament of Canada and received Royal Assent to allow euthanasia within Canada.\n\nOn 20 May 1997, the Constitutional Court of Colombia decriminalised piety homicide, for terminally ill patients, stating that \"the medical author cannot be held responsible for the assisted suicide of a terminally ill patient\" and urged Congress to regulate euthanasia \"in the shortest time possible\".\n\nOn 15 December 2014, the Constitutional Court had given the Ministry of Health and Social Protection 30 days to publish guidelines for the healthcare sector to use in order to guarantee terminated ill patients, with the wish to undergo euthanasia, their right to a dignified death.\n\nThe Netherlands legalized voluntary euthanasia in 2001 and is one of the few countries in the world to have done so. Under current Dutch law, euthanasia by doctors is only legal in cases of \"hopeless and unbearable\" suffering. In practice this means that it is limited to those suffering from serious medical conditions (including mental illness) and in considerable suffering like pain, hypoxia or exhaustion. Helping somebody to commit suicide without meeting the qualifications of the current Dutch euthanasia law is illegal. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life.\n\nIn February 2010 a citizens' initiative called \"Uit Vrije Wil\" (Out of Free Will) further demanded that all Dutch people over 70 who feel tired of life should have the right to professional help in ending it. The organization, initiated by Milly van Stiphout and Yvonne van Baarle, started collecting signatures in support of this proposed change in Dutch legislation. A number of prominent Dutch citizens supported the initiative, including former ministers and artists, legal scholars and physicians. Among them were former politicians Frits Bolkestein, Hedy d'Ancona and Jan Terlouw, as well as television personality Mies Bouwman. This initiative has never been legalised.\n\nEuthanasia is illegal in New Zealand. In 2015, lawyer and cancer sufferer Lecretia Seales brought a case (Seales v Attorney-General) to the High Court to challenge New Zealand law for her right to die with the assistance of her GP, asking for a declaration that her GP would not risk conviction.\n\nThe term \"right to die\" has been interpreted in a number of ways, including issues of suicide, passive euthanasia, active euthanasia, assisted suicide, and physician-assisted suicide. As the health of citizens is considered a police power left for individual states to regulate, it was not until 1997 that the US Supreme Court made a ruling on the issue of assisted suicide and one's right to die. That year, the Supreme Court heard two appeals arguing that New York and Washington statutes that made physician assisted suicide a felony violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In a unanimous vote, the Court held that there was no constitutional right to physician assisted suicide and upheld state bans on assisted suicide. While in New York this has maintained statutes banning physician assisted suicide, the Court's decision also left it open for other states to decide whether they would allow physician assisted suicide or not.\n\nSince 1994, five states in the US have passed assisted suicide laws: Oregon, Washington, Vermont, California, and Colorado passed legislation in 1994, 2008, 2013, 2015, and 2016, respectively, that provides a protocol for the practice of physician assisted suicide. The law in these five states allows terminally ill adult patients to seek lethal medication from their physicians. In 2009, the Montana Supreme Court ruled that nothing in state law prohibits physician-assisted suicide and provides legal protection for physicians in the case that they write a prescription for lethal medication upon patient request. In California, the governor signed a controversial physician assisted-suicide bill, the California End of Life Option Act, in October 2015 that passed during a special legislative session intended to address Medi-Cal funding, after it had been defeated during the regular legislative session. Because the bill was passed during a special session, it did not take effect until June 2016.\n\nIn early 2014, a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e. making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient. The ultimate decision will be made with the outcome of New Mexico's Attorney General's appeal to the ruling.\nSince 2018, the Supreme Court of India has legalised passive euthanasia in India during a case involving Aruna Shanbaug under strict conditions, namely that the patient's consent (or relatives) is needed, and that he/she must be in a terminally ill or vegetative state. \n\nInitiatives\n\nGroups\n\nFilms\n\nBooks\nIndividuals\nOther related\n"}

{"id": "26552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26552", "title": "Roy Orbison", "text": "Roy Orbison\n\nRoy Kelton Orbison (April 23, 1936 – December 6, 1988) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician known for his powerful voice, wide vocal range, impassioned singing style, complex song structures, and dark, emotional ballads. The combination led many critics to describe his music as operatic, nicknaming him \"the Caruso of Rock\" and \"the Big O\". While most male rock-and-roll performers in the 1950s and 1960s projected a defiant masculinity, many of Orbison's songs instead conveyed vulnerability. His voice ranged from baritone to tenor, and music scholars have suggested that he had a three- or four-octave range. During performances, he was known for standing still and solitary, and for wearing black clothes, to match his dyed jet-black hair and dark sunglasses, which lent an air of mystery to his persona.\n\nBorn in Texas, Orbison began singing in a rockabilly and country-and-western band in high school. He was signed by Sam Phillips, of Sun Records, in 1956, but his greatest success came with Monument Records. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of his singles reached the \"Billboard\" Top 40, and he wrote or co-wrote almost all that rose to the Top 10, including \"Only the Lonely\" (1960), \"Running Scared\" (1961), \"Crying\" (1961), \"In Dreams\" (1963), and \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" (1964). Soon afterward, Orbison was struck by a number of personal tragedies while his record sales declined. In the 1980s, he experienced a resurgence in popularity through the success of several cover versions of his songs, and in 1988, co-founded the Traveling Wilburys, a rock supergroup with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne. He died of a heart attack later that year, at the age of 52. One month later, his song \"You Got It\" (1989), co-written with Lynne and Petty, was released as a solo single and became his first to break the U.S. Top 10 in 25 years.\n\nHis honors include inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in the same year, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1989. \"Rolling Stone\" placed him at number 37 on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time'. In 2002, \"Billboard\" magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.\n\nRoy Kelton Orbison was born in Vernon, Texas, the middle son of Orbie Lee Orbison (1913–1984), an oil well driller and car mechanic, and Nadine Vesta Shults (July 25, 1913 – May 28, 1992), a nurse. Both of his parents were unemployed during the Great Depression, and searching for work, moved the family to Fort Worth in 1942. He attended Denver Avenue Elementary School until a polio scare prompted the family to return to Vernon. Later, in 1946, they moved to Wink, Texas. Orbison later described life in Wink as \"football, oil fields, oil, grease, and sand\" and expressed relief that he was able to leave the desolate town. All the Orbison children were afflicted with poor eyesight; Roy used thick corrective lenses from an early age. He was not confident about his appearance and began dyeing his nearly-white hair black when he was still young. He was quiet, self-effacing, and remarkably polite and obliging—a product, biographer Alan Clayson wrote, of his Southern upbringing. He was readily available to sing, however, and often became the focus of attention when he did. He considered his voice memorable, if not great.\n\nOn Roy's sixth birthday, his father gave him a guitar. He later recalled that by the age of seven, \"I was finished, you know, for anything else\"; music would be his life. His major musical influence as a youth was country music. He was particularly moved by Lefty Frizzell's singing, with its slurred syllables. (When he later joined the British-American supergroup the Traveling Wilburys, he adopted the name “Lefty” Wilbury). He also enjoyed Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers. One of the first musicians he heard in person was Ernest Tubb, who was playing on the back of a flatbed truck in Fort Worth. In West Texas, he was exposed to many forms of music: \"sepia\" (a euphemism for rhythm and blues), Tex-Mex, the orchestral arrangements of Mantovani, and cajun. The cajun favorite \"Jole Blon\" was one of the first songs he sang in public. At the age of eight, he began singing on a local radio show. By the late 1940s, he was the show's host.\n\nIn high school, Orbison and some friends formed a band, the Wink Westerners. They played country standards and Glenn Miller songs at local honky-tonks and had a weekly radio show on KERB in Kermit. When they were offered $400 to play at a dance, Orbison realized that he could make a living in music. After graduating from Wink High School, he enrolled at North Texas State College in Denton, planning to study geology so that he could secure work in the oil fields if music did not pay. Orbison heard that his North Texas State schoolmate Pat Boone had signed a record deal, which further strengthened his resolve to become a professional musician. While at North Texas State College, Roy heard a song called \"Ooby Dooby\", composed by Dick Penner and Wade Moore in mere minutes atop a fraternity house at the college, and after his first year of college, he returned to Wink with \"Ooby Dooby\" in hand and continued performing with the Wink Westerners. Orbison moved to Odessa, Texas, and enrolled in Odessa Junior College. As two members of the band quit, one to attend school elsewhere and one to join the Navy, two new members were added to the group, who won a talent contest and obtained their own television show on KMID-TV in Midland, Texas. The Wink Westerners kept performing on local TV, played dances on the weekends, and attended college during the day.\n\nWhile living in Odessa, Orbison saw a performance by Elvis Presley, who was only a year older and a rising star. Johnny Cash toured the area in 1955 and 1956, appearing on the same local TV show as the Wink Westerners, and suggested that Orbison approach Sam Phillips at Sun Records, the home of rockabilly artists Presley, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis (in late 1956), and Cash. Orbison telephoned Phillips and during their conversation was curtly told, \"Johnny Cash doesn't run my record company!\" The success of their KMID television show got them another show on KOSA-TV, and they changed their name to the Teen Kings, as they were appealing more and more to a younger audience. Due to the initial rejection from Sam Phillips, the Teen Kings recorded \"Ooby Dooby\" for the Odessa-based Je–Wel label. According to the official Roy Orbison discography by Marcel Riesco, this was the first release by Orbison in March 1956. Phillips was impressed with the song, after the local record store owner Poppa Holifield played it for him over the telephone, and offered the Teen Kings a contract in 1956.\n\nThe Teen Kings went to Sun Studio in Memphis, where Phillips wanted to record \"Ooby Dooby\" again, in his studio. The song was released on Sun 242 in May 1956. and broke into the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, peaking at number 59 and selling 200,000 copies. The Teen Kings toured with Sonny James, Johnny Horton, Carl Perkins, and Cash. Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing \"everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record\". The Teen Kings also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including \"Go! Go! Go!\" and \"Rockhouse\". The band ultimately split over disputed writing credits and royalties, but Orbison stayed in Memphis and asked his 16-year-old girlfriend, Claudette Frady, to join him there. They stayed in Phillips's home, sleeping in separate rooms. In the studio, Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording. Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice. A ballad Orbison wrote, \"The Clown\", met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer Jack Clement told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.\n\nOrbison had some success at Sun Records, however, and was introduced to Elvis Presley's social circle, once going to pick up a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac. Orbison wrote \"Claudette\"—about Claudette Frady whom he married in 1957—and the Everly Brothers recorded it for their subsequent release as the B-side of their smash hit \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\". The first, and perhaps only, royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled him to make a down payment on his own Cadillac. Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958 after touring with Patsy Cline, Eddie Cochran, and Gene Vincent. \n\nFor a brief period in the late 1950s, Orbison made his living at Acuff-Rose, a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After spending an entire day writing a song, he would make several demonstration tapes at a time and send them to Wesley Rose, who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison attempted to sell to RCA Victor his recordings of songs by other writers, working with and being in awe of Chet Atkins, who had played guitar with Presley. One song he tried was \"Seems to Me\", by Boudleaux Bryant. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of \"a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene. I remember the way he sang then—softly, prettily but almost bashfully, as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him.\"\n\nPlaying shows late into the night and living with his wife and young child in his tiny apartment, Orbison often sought refuge by taking his guitar to his car and writing songs there. The songwriter Joe Melson, an acquaintance of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to try to write some songs together. In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison recorded seven songs at RCA Nashville, with Atkins producing, but only two singles were judged worthy of release by RCA; Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of the producer Fred Foster at Monument Records.\n\nOrbison was one of the first recording artists to popularize the \"Nashville sound\", doing so with a group of session musicians known as the A-Team: guitarists Grady Martin, Harold Bradley, Fred Carter, Jr., and Ray Edenton; bassist Bob Moore; pianists Floyd Cramer or Hargus \"Pig\" Robbins; drummer Buddy Harman; and backup vocals by the Jordanaires or the Anita Kerr Singers. The Nashville sound was developed by producers Chet Atkins, Owen Bradley (who worked closely with Patsy Cline), Sam Phillips, and Fred Foster. In his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded a song that RCA had refused, \"Paper Boy\", backed by \"With the Bug\", but neither charted.\n\nAccording to musician and author Albin Zak, the studio (with sound engineer Bill Porter, who experimented with close miking the doo-wop backing singers), the production by Foster, and the accompanying musicians gave Orbison's music a \"polished, professional sound ... finally allow[ing] Orbison's stylistic inclinations free rein\". To augment the Nashville sound, Orbison requested a string section in the studio. With this combination, he recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was \"Uptown\", written with Joe Melson. Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, \"We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world.\" \"The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll\" states that the music Orbison made in Nashville \"brought a new splendor to rock\", and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of Phil Spector.\n\n\"Uptown\" reached only number 72 on the \"Billboard\" Top 100, and Orbison set his sights on negotiating a contract with an upscale nightclub somewhere. His initial success came just as the '50s rock-and-roll era was winding down. Elvis Presley was serving in the US Army, Jerry Lee Lewis had become disgraced after marrying his 13-year-old cousin, and Buddy Holly had died in a plane crash. Starting in 1960, the charts in the United States came to be dominated by teen idols, novelty acts, and Motown girl groups.\n\nExperimenting with a new sound, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which, using elements from \"Uptown\", and another song they had written called \"Come Back to Me (My Love)\", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers. It also featured a note hit by Orbison in falsetto that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, \"came not from his throat but deeper within\". The song was \"Only the Lonely\". Orbison and Melson tried to pitch it to Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers, but were turned down. They instead recorded the song at RCA's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy, building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background. This combination became Orbison's trademark sound.\n\n\"Only the Lonely\" shot to number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia. According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told \"Rolling Stone\" in 1988, \"I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Only the Lonely\", it kind of turned into a good voice.\" Its success transformed Orbison into an overnight star and he appeared on Dick Clark's \"Saturday Night Beechnut Show\" out of New York City. When Presley heard \"Only the Lonely\" for the first time, he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends. Melson and Orbison followed it with the more complex \"Blue Angel\", which peaked at number nine in the US and number 11 in the UK. \"I'm Hurtin'\", with \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" as the B-side, rose to number 27 in the US, but failed to chart in the UK.\n\nOrbison was now able to move to Nashville permanently with his wife Claudette and two sons Roy DeWayne and Anthony King. Back in the studio, seeking a change from the pop sound of \"Only the Lonely\" and \"I'm Hurtin'\", Orbison worked on a new song, \"Running Scared\", based loosely on the rhythm of Ravel's \"Boléro\"; the song was about a man on the lookout for his girlfriend's previous boyfriend, whom he feared would try to take her away. Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song's highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice. Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice. Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high 'A' naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing. On that third take, \"Running Scared\" was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, \"He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before.\" Just weeks later \"Running Scared\" reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and number 9 in the UK. The composition of Orbison's following hits reflected \"Running Scared\": a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed Orbison's dynamic voice.\n\n\"Crying\" followed in July 1961 and reached number two; it was coupled with an up-tempo R&B song, \"Candy Man\", written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross, which reached the \"Billboard\" Top 30, staying on the charts for two months. While Orbison was touring Australia in 1962, an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as \"The Big O\", partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads, and the moniker stuck with him thereafter. Orbison's second son was born the same year, and Orbison hit number four in the United States and number two in the UK with \"Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)\", an upbeat song by country songwriter Cindy Walker. (Orbison's producer would later form the Candymen quintet, which was Orbison's backing band from 1965 to 1970, while releasing a few singles and two albums of their own). Also in 1962, he charted with \"The Crowd\", \"Leah\", and \"Workin' for the Man\", which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink. His relationship with Joe Melson, however, was deteriorating over Melson's growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground.\n\nOrbison eventually developed a persona and an image that did not reflect his personality. He had no publicist in the early 1960s, therefore he had little presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. \"Life\" called him an \"anonymous celebrity\". After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an airplane in 1963, while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had a good sense of humor and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe stage fright; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat from the attention. The ever-present sunglasses led some people to assume that the stationary performer was blind. His black clothes and the desperation in his songs emanated the image of mystery and introversion. His dark and brooding persona, combined with his tremulous voice in lovelorn ballads marketed to teenagers, made Orbison a star in the early 1960s. His string of top-40 hits continued with \"In Dreams\" (US number seven, UK number six), \"Falling\" (US number 22, UK number 9), and \"Mean Woman Blues\" (US number five, UK number three) coupled with \"Blue Bayou\" (US number 29, UK number three). According to the official Roy Orbison U.S. discography by Marcel Riesco, a rare alternate version of \"Blue Bayou\" was released only in Italy. Orbison finished 1963 with a Christmas song written by Willie Nelson, \"Pretty Paper\" (US number 15 in 1963, UK number six in 1964).\n\nAs \"In Dreams\" was released in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace the guitarist Duane Eddy on a tour of the UK in top billing with the Beatles, whose popularity was on the rise. When he arrived in Britain, however, he saw the amount of advertising devoted to the quartet and realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of them, and annoyed, asked rhetorically, \"What's a Beatle, anyway?\" to which John Lennon replied, after tapping his shoulder, \"I am\". On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. Known for having raucous shows expressing an extraordinary amount of energy, Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison performed completely still and simply sang through 14 encores. Finally, when the audience began chanting \"We want Roy!\" again, Lennon and McCartney prevented Orbison from going on again by physically holding him back. Starr later said, \"In Glasgow, we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just standing there, not moving or anything.\" Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work. Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.\n\nTouring in 1963 took a toll on Orbison's personal life. His wife Claudette began having an affair with the contractor who built their home in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Friends and relatives attributed the breakdown of the marriage to her youth and her inability to withstand being alone and bored. When Orbison toured Britain again in the fall of 1963, she joined him. He was immensely popular wherever he went, finishing the tour in Ireland and Canada. Almost immediately, he toured Australia and New Zealand with the Beach Boys and returned again to Britain and Ireland, where he was so besieged by teenaged girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him. He continued to tour, traveling to Australia again, this time with the Rolling Stones. Mick Jagger later remarked, referring to a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand, \"a fine figure of a man in the hot springs, he was.\"\n\nOrbison also began collaborating with Bill Dees, whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote \"It's Over\", a number-one hit in the UK and a song that would be one of his signature pieces for the rest of his career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, \"A pretty woman never needs any money\". Just 40 minutes later, \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a Bob Hope movie, the epithet \"mercy\" Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, and a merging of his vulnerable and masculine sides, it rose to number one in the fall of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK, as well, spending 18 weeks total on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies. Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as \"Billboard\" magazine noted, \"In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the \"only\" American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic.\"\n\nFollowing \"Oh, Pretty Woman\", Orbison endured some upheavals. Claudette and he divorced in November 1964 over her infidelities, but the two reconciled 10 months later. His contract with Monument was expiring in June 1965. Wesley Rose, at this time acting as Orbison's agent, moved him from Monument Records to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) (though in Europe he remained with Decca's London Records) for $1 million, and the understanding that he would expand into television and films, as Elvis Presley had done. Orbison was a film enthusiast and, when not touring, writing or recording, would dedicate time to seeing up to three films a day.\n\nRose also became Orbison's producer. Fred Foster later suggested that Rose's takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison's work at MGM. Engineer Bill Porter agreed that Orbison's best work could only be achieved with RCA Nashville's A-Team. Orbison's first collection at MGM, an album titled \"There Is Only One Roy Orbison\", sold fewer than 200,000 copies. With the onset of the British Invasion in 1964–65, the direction of popular music shifted dramatically, and most performers of Orbison's generation were driven from the charts.\n\nWhile on tour again in the UK in 1966, Orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track; he performed his show that evening in a cast. Claudette traveled to England to accompany Roy for the remainder of the tour. It was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together (they had remarried in December 1965).\n\nOrbison was fascinated with machines. He was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot. He had a large collection of cars by the late 1960s.\n\nOrbison and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles; she had grown up around them, but he claimed Elvis Presley had introduced him to motorcycles. Tragedy struck on June 6, 1966, however, when Orbison and Claudette were riding home from Bristol, Tennessee. She struck the door of a pickup truck which had pulled out in front of her on South Water Avenue in Gallatin, Tennessee, and died instantly.\n\nA grieving Orbison threw himself into his work, collaborating with Bill Dees to write music for \"The Fastest Guitar Alive\", a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well. It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy. Orbison's character was a spy who stole, and had to protect and deliver, a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, and was outfitted with a guitar that turned into a rifle. The prop allowed him to deliver the line, \"I could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time\", with—according to biographer Colin Escott—\"zero conviction\". Orbison was pleased with the film, although it proved to be a critical and box office flop. While MGM had included five films in his contract, no more were made.\n\nHe recorded an album dedicated to the songs of Don Gibson and another of Hank Williams covers, but both sold poorly. During the counterculture era, with the charts dominated by artists like Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, the Rolling Stones, and the Doors, Orbison felt lost and directionless, later saying: \"[I] didn't hear a lot I could relate to so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change, and you're still there and you bloom again.\" \n\nDuring a tour of England and playing Bournemouth on Saturday, September 14, 1968, he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down, and his two eldest sons had died. The property was sold to Johnny Cash, who demolished the building and planted an orchard on it. On March 25, 1969, Orbison married German teenager Barbara Jakobs, whom he had met several days before his sons' deaths. Wesley (born 1965), his youngest son with Claudette, was raised by Orbison's parents. Orbison and Barbara had a son (Roy Kelton) in 1970 and another (Alexander) in 1975.\n\nOrbison continued recording albums in the 1970s, but none of them sold more than a handful of copies, and by 1976, he had gone an entire decade without a charting album. Aside from a few minor hits in Australia, he also failed to produce any charting singles after the 1960s. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents and several of his 1970s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records. Author Peter Lehman would later observe that his absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: \"Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone.\" His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released covers of his songs, which proved popular. Orbison's version of \"Love Hurts\", a song composed by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and first recorded by the Everly Brothers, was remade by Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, again by hard rock band Nazareth, and by blues adept Jim Capaldi. Sonny James sent \"Only the Lonely\" to No. 1 on the country music charts. Bruce Springsteen ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and Glen Campbell had a minor hit with a remake of \"Dream Baby\". \n\nA compilation of Orbison's greatest hits went to No. 1 in the UK in January 1976. The same year, he began to open concerts for the Eagles, who started as Linda Ronstadt's backup band. Ronstadt herself covered \"Blue Bayou\" in 1977, her version reaching No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career. He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded \"Regeneration\" with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.\n\nIn late 1977, Orbison was not feeling well and decided to overwinter in Hawaii. While there, he checked into a hospital where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed coronary arteries. On January 18, 1978, Orbison underwent a triple coronary bypass. He had suffered from duodenal ulcers since as early as 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence. He felt revitalized following the triple bypass, but he continued to smoke, and his weight fluctuated for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn 1980, Don McLean charted with \"Crying\" and his version unexpectedly went to the top of the charts at first in the Netherlands, afterward hitting No. 5 in the US and staying on the charts for 15 weeks; it was No. 1 in the UK for three weeks, and also topped the Irish Charts. Although he was all but forgotten in the US, Orbison reached the most unlikely places for a rock and roll legend, like Bulgaria for example in 1982. He was astonished to find that he was as popular there as he had been in 1964; he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of Sofia. In 1981, he and Emmylou Harris had won a Grammy Award for their duet \"That Lovin' You Feelin' Again\" (from the comedy film \"Roadie\", in which Orbison also had a cameo role) and things were picking up. It was his first such award, and he felt hopeful in making a full return to popular music. However, it would be several more years until this came to fruition. In the meantime, Van Halen released a hard-rock cover of \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" on their 1982 album \"Diver Down\", again further exposing a younger generation to Orbison's legacy.\n\nOrbison originally declined David Lynch's request to allow the use of \"In Dreams\" for the film \"Blue Velvet\" (1986). Lynch used it anyway (although his first choice was \"Crying\"); the song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named Frank Booth (played by Dennis Hopper). It was lip-synched by an effeminate drug dealer played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere. Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, \"I was mortified because they were talking about the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal ... I thought, 'What in the world ...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie—how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'.\"\n\nBy 1987, Orbison's career was fully revived. He released an album of his re-recorded hits, titled \"\". A song he recorded, \"Life Fades Away\", written with his friend Glenn Danzig, was featured in the film \"Less Than Zero\" (1987). He and k.d. lang performed a duet of \"Crying\" for inclusion on the soundtrack to the film, \"Hiding Out\" (1987), winning a Grammy for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals.\n\nAlso in 1987, Orbison was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album \"Born to Run\": \"I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison.\" In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt \"validated\" by the honor. A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. They were joined by Jackson Browne, T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, James Burton, and k.d. lang. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: \"Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional.\" The concert was filmed in one take and aired on Cinemax under the title \"\"; it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.\n\nIt was also in 1988 that Orbison began collaborating seriously with Electric Light Orchestra bandleader Jeff Lynne on a new album. Lynne had just completed production work on George Harrison's \"Cloud Nine\" album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on a song of Harrison's new single. They subsequently contacted Bob Dylan, who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to Tom Petty's residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour. By that evening, the group had written \"Handle with Care\", which led to the concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the Traveling Wilburys, representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself \"Lefty Wilbury\" after Lefty Frizzell. Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: \"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder. I remember him as a Baptist minister.\"\n\nLynne later spoke of the recording sessions: \"Everybody just sat there going, 'Wow, it's Roy Orbison!'... Even though he's become your pal and you're hanging out and having a laugh and going to dinner, as soon as he gets behind that [mic] and he's doing his business, suddenly it's shudder time.\" Orbison was given one solo track, \"Not Alone Any More\", on the album. His contributions were highly praised by the press. \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\" spent 53 weeks on the US charts, peaking at number three. It reached No. 1 in Australia and topped out at No. 16 in the UK. The album won a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group. \"Rolling Stone\" included it in the top 100 albums of the decade.\n\nOrbison was in high demand for concerts and interviews once again, and was seemingly ecstatic about it. He began writing songs and collaborating with many musicians from his past and newer fans, to develop a solo album, \"Mystery Girl\".\n\n\"Mystery Girl\" was co-produced by Jeff Lynne, whom Orbison considered the best producer he had ever collaborated with. Elvis Costello, Orbison's son Wesley and others offered their songs to him. The biggest hit from the album was \"You Got It\", written with Lynne and Tom Petty. It posthumously rose to No. 9 in the US and No. 3 in the UK.\n\nIn 2014, a demo of Orbison's \"The Way Is Love\" was released as part of the 25th-anniversary deluxe edition of \"Mystery Girl\". The song was originally recorded on a stereo cassette player around 1986. Orbison's sons contributed instrumentation on the track along with Roy's vocals; it was produced by John Carter Cash.\n\nAlthough the video for the Wilburys' \"Handle with Care\" was filmed with Orbison, the video for \"End of the Line\" was filmed and released posthumously. During Orbison's vocal parts in \"End of the Line\", the video shows a guitar in a rocking chair, next to Orbison's framed photo.\n\nOrbison determinedly pursued his second chance at stardom, but he expressed amazement at his success: \"It's very nice to be wanted again, but I still can't quite believe it.\" He lost some weight to fit his new image and the constant demand of touring, as well as the newer demands of making videos. In the final three months of his life, he gave \"Rolling Stone\" magazine extensive access to his daily activities; he intended to write an autobiography and wanted Martin Sheen to play him in a biopic. In November 1988, \"Mystery Girl\" was completed, and \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\" was rising up the charts. Around this time, Orbison confided in Johnny Cash that he was having chest pains and said he would have to do something about his health, but he never did. He went to Europe, was presented with an award there, and played a show in Antwerp, where footage for the video for \"You Got It\" was filmed. He gave several interviews a day in a hectic schedule. A few days later, a manager at a club in Boston was concerned that he looked ill, but Orbison played the show, to another standing ovation.\n\nOrbison performed at the Front Row Theater in Highland Heights, Ohio, on December 4. Exhausted, he returned to his home in Hendersonville to rest for several days before flying again to London to film two more videos for the Traveling Wilburys. On December 6, he spent the day flying model airplanes with his sons and ate dinner at his mother's home in Hendersonville. Later that day, he died of a heart attack, at the age of 52.\n\nThe tabloid \"National Enquirer\" suggested on its cover that Orbison had worked himself to death. A memorial was held in Nashville, and another in Los Angeles. He was buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in an unmarked grave. On April 8, 1989, Orbison became the first deceased musician since Elvis Presley to have two albums in the US Top Five at the same time, with the Traveling Wilburys album at number 4 and his own \"Mystery Girl\" at number 5. In the United Kingdom, he achieved even greater posthumous success, with two solo albums in the Top 3 in the chart dated February 11, 1989, \"Mystery Girl\" at number 2 and the compilation \"The Legendary Roy Orbison\" at number 3.\n\nOrbison is regarded as a rock-and-roll pioneer and has been cited by numerous critics as one of the genre's most influential musicians, but his style is notable for how it departed from the norm. Rock and roll in the 1950s was defined by a driving backbeat, heavy guitars, and lyrical themes that glorified youthful rebellion. Few of Orbison's recordings have these characteristics. The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll. Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, \"He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth.\"\n\nRoys Boys LLC, a Nashville-based company founded by Orbison’s sons to administer their father’s catalog and safeguard his legacy, announced a November 16, 2018 release of \"Unchained Melodies: Roy Orbison with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra\" album as well as a fall 2018 Roy Orbison Hologram tour called\"In Dreams: Roy Orbison in Concert\".\n\nMusic critic Dave Marsh wrote that Orbison's compositions \"define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music\". Orbison's music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird. Peter Watrous, writing for the \"New York Times\", declared in a concert review, \"He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together. The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard thirty-two-bar form for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Claudette\". Orbison's \"In Dreams\" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In \"Running Scared\", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. \"Crying\" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'. Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before \"Only the Lonely\", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:\n\nElton John's songwriting partner and main lyricist Bernie Taupin wrote that Orbison's songs always made \"radical left turns\", and k.d. lang declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised, such as how the entirety of \"Running Scared\" eventually depends on the final note, one word. Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do. The Nashville session guitarist Jerry Kennedy stated, \"Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you.\"\n\nCritic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as \"Go! Go! Go!\" and \"Mean Woman Blues\" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine braggadocio. In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.\n\nIn 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: \"Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easy—try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention.\" After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of \"The New York Times\" wrote that Orbison's songs are \"dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces\". Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the \"apocalyptic romanticism\" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was \"so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia\", striking \"a postmodern nerve\". Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant favored American R&B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: \"The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically.\"\n\nThe loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: \"I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else ... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely.\" His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees stated, \"He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things... Before that no one would do it.\" Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: \"When [\"Crying\"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry.\" Peter Lehman, on the other hand, considered Orbison's theme of constant vulnerability an element of sexual masochism.\n\nOrbison admitted that he did not think his voice was put to appropriate use until \"Only the Lonely\" in 1960, when it was able, in his words, to allow its \"flowering\". Carl Perkins, however, toured with Orbison while they were both signed with Sun Records and recalled a specific concert when Orbison covered the Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald standard \"Indian Love Call\", and had the audience completely silenced, in awe. When compared to the Everly Brothers, who often used the same session musicians, Orbison is credited with \"a passionate intensity\" that, according to \"The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll\", made \"his love, his life, and, indeed, the whole world [seem] to be coming to an end—not with a whimper, but an agonized, beautiful bang\".\n\nBruce Springsteen and Billy Joel both commented on the otherworldly quality of Orbison's voice. Dwight Yoakam stated that Orbison's voice sounded like \"the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window\". Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees went further to say that when he heard \"Crying\" for the first time, \"That was it. To me that was the voice of God.\" Elvis Presley stated his voice was the greatest and most distinctive he had ever heard. Orbison's music and voice have been compared to opera by Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, and songwriter Will Jennings, among others. Dylan marked Orbison as a specific influence, remarking that there was nothing like him on radio in the early 1960s: \n\nLikewise, Tim Goodwin, who conducted the orchestra that backed Orbison in Bulgaria, had been told that Orbison's voice would be a singular experience to hear. When Orbison started with \"Crying\" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: \"The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up. It was an incredible physical sensation.\" Bassist Jerry Scheff, who backed Orbison in his \"\" concert, wrote about him, \"Roy Orbison was like an opera singer. His voice melted out of his mouth into the stratosphere and back. He never seemed like he was trying to sing, he just did it.\"\n\nOrbison's severe stage fright was particularly noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s. During the first few songs in a concert, the vibrato in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable. This also happened with age. Orbison noticed that he was unable to control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings, and chose to record in the mornings when it was possible.\n\nOrbison often excused his motionless performances by saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage, although songs like \"Mean Woman Blues\" did offer that. He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented, \"I'm not a super personality—on stage or off. I mean, you could put workers like Chubby Checker or Bobby Rydell in second-rate shows and they'd still shine through, but not me. I'd have to be prepared. People come to hear my music, my songs. That's what I have to give them.\"\n\nLang compared Orbison to a tree, with passive but solid beauty. This image of Orbison as immovable was so associated with him it was parodied by John Belushi on \"Saturday Night Live\", as Belushi dressed as Orbison falls over while singing \"Oh, Pretty Woman\", and continues to play as his bandmates set him upright again. However, Lang quantified this style by saying, \"It's so hard to explain what Roy's energy was like because he would fill a room with his energy and presence but not say a word. Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there.\"\n\nOrbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant and his father would bring a guitar in the evenings and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military would gather, and drink and sing heartily. Orbison later reflected, \"I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.' Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time.\"\n\n\nVideo and televised feature performances:\n\n\n"}

Hence, it combines the classical knowledge of chemistry (structure, reactions and interactions of molecules) together with a systems approach inspired by systems biology and systems science.\n\nWhile multicomponent reactions have been studied for centuries, the idea of deliberately analyzing mixtures and reaction networks is more recent. The first mentions of systems chemistry as a field date from 2005 . Early adopters focused on prebiotic chemistry combined with supramolecular chemistry, before it was generalized to the study of emergent properties and functions of any complex molecular systems. A 2017 review in the field of systems chemistry described the state of the art as out-of-equilibrium self-assembly, fuelled molecular motion, chemical networks in compartments and oscillating reactions.\n\nDynamic combinatorial chemistry has been used as a method to develop ligands for biomolecules and receptors for small molecules.\n\nLigands that can recognize biomolecules are being identified by preparing libraries of potential ligands in the presence of a target biomacromolecule. This approach sets the stage for their application as diagnostic biosensors for fast monitoring of imbalances and illnesses and therapeutic agents.\n\nIndividual components of certain chemical system will self-assemble to form receptors which are\ncomplementary to target molecule. In principle, the preferred library members will select and\namplify based on the strongest interactions between the template and products.\n\nA fundamental difference exists between chemistry as it is performed in most laboratories and chemistry as it occurs in life. Laboratory processes are mostly designed such that the (closed) system goes thermodynamically downhill; i.e. the product state is of lower Gibbs free energy, yielding stable molecules that can be isolated and stored. Yet the chemistry of life operates in a very different way: Most molecules from which living systems are constituted are turned over continuously and are not necessarily thermodynamically stable. Nevertheless, living systems can be stable, but in a homeostatic sense. Such homeostatic (open) systems are far-from-equilibrium and are dissipative: they need energy to maintain themselves. In dissipative controlled systems the continuous supply of energy allows a continuous transition between different supramolecular states, where systems with unexpected properties may be discovered. One of the grand challenges of Systems Chemistry is to unveil complex reactions networks, where molecules continuously consume energy to perform specific functions.\n"}

The titular Blob is an amorphous acidic amoeba-like organism that devours and dissolves anything in its path as it grows.\n\nA remake of the 1958 horror film of the same name, the film was theatrically released in 1988, and was a box office disappointment, earning $8.2 million. It received mixed reviews but was praised for its special effects. Much like the original film, the remake has since gained a cult following.\n\nA meteorite crashes near Arbeville, Colorado. An elderly transient discovers, within the sphere, a massive slime mold-like substance that adheres to his hand. Three high school students, Brian, Meg and Paul, take him to a hospital. After Brian leaves, Paul witnesses the lower half of the transient melting from exposure to the Blob. As he calls for help, the Blob drops on top of him. Meg arrives to see Paul being devoured by the growing Blob. While she tries freeing him, his arm dissolves off, Meg is thrown against a wall and knocked unconscious, and the Blob fully dissolves Paul and oozes out of the hospital.\n\nScott, Paul's friend and classmate, & his date Vicki prove to be the Blob's next victims. Vicki passes out after Scott gets her drunk - The varsity football player prepares a mass-produced class ring to seduce her and mixes her another drink while the Blob enters the car and kills Vicki. Scott, thinking Vicki is still just asleep, reaches his hand into her shirt and is grabbed by the Blob that is consuming Vicki from the inside out. Scott is consumed.\n\nAfter Brian and Meg have unsatisfactory encounters with the police, they meet at a diner where Meg tells Brian about the Blob. Brian's disbelief is shattered when the diner's handyman is violently dragged headfirst into a sink drain by the Blob. It pursues them to the diner's walk-in freezer, but the Blob retreats after entering the freezer. After consuming the diner's owner Fran Hewitt and Sheriff Geller, the Blob reenters the sewers. Meg and Brian return to the police station, where the dispatcher tells them Deputy Briggs is near the meteor-landing site. They discover a military operation led by a scientist, Dr. Meddows, who orders the town and the two teens quarantined. While Brian escapes, Meg is taken to town where she learns her younger brother, Kevin, is missing. Meg learns he and his friend, Eddie, snuck into the movie theater. The Blob enters the theater, attacking the staff and audience. Meg arrives as the audience flees the theater, rescuing Eddie and Kevin.\n\nBrian eavesdrops on Meddows and learns that the Blob is a biological warfare experiment created during the Cold War, launched into space because it was so dangerous. Learning that the Blob has entered the sewers, Meddows decides to trap it there, even if that means allowing Meg, Kevin, and Eddie to die. Brian is discovered listening in and evades military personnel by driving his motorcycle into the sewers. In the sewers, Meg and Kevin flee from the Blob when it emerges and devours Eddie. Kevin escapes by scaling a pipe to the surface, and Meg is saved by Brian, who confronts Meddows in front of the townsfolk and Briggs. After failing to convince everyone Brian is contaminated and must die, Meddows attempts to shoot him, but is killed by the Blob as it oozes into his chemical suit and drags him into the sewer. Then, Meddows' second in command, Colonel Hargis attempts to kill the Blob by shooting it to death and blowing it up with a bomb. But this only succeeds in enraging the creature. The Blob bursts out of the sewer and kills Hargis before feasting on the town's population. The town's Reverend Meeker proclaims the scene to be the prophesied end of the world, after which a failed flamethrower attack on the Blob sets him ablaze. Meg saves him with a fire extinguisher, and in the process blasts the Blob with it. When the monster backs off, she realizes that the Blob cannot tolerate cold.\n\nThe survivors retreat to the town hall and hold the Blob off with furniture-barricades and fire extinguishers, but it is a losing battle; the Blob engulfs half the building and devours Briggs. Brian goes to the town's garage and gets a snow maker truck that has canisters of liquid nitrogen attached. As the Blob is about to consume Meg and her family, Brian shoots snow at the creature, which is angered and knocks the truck over. As the Blob surges toward Brian, Meg lures it away from him toward the canisters, which she has rigged with an explosive charge taken from a dying soldier. She tries getting clear, but snags her foot between two pieces of metal, trapping her. Brian regains consciousness and runs over to free her. The Blob is about to overrun them when the charge goes off, blowing up the canisters and covering the Blob in liquid nitrogen. The creature is flash-frozen, shattering into a mass of crystallized pieces. Moss Woodley has its remains stored in the town ice house.\n\nLater, at a tent-meeting church service in a field, Meeker, disfigured by his burns and secretly driven insane, preaches a doomsday sermon resembling the Blob's attack. He has a still-living piece of the Blob, trapped inside a glass jar, to eventually unleash it once more upon the world.\n\nScreenwriter Frank Darabont first met director Chuck Russell in 1981, while working as a production assistant on the film \"Hell Night\". Before working together on \"The Blob\", the two also collaborated on the script for \"\".\n\nActor Del Close had been scheduled to direct a \"mock opera\" about Ronald Reagan at New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts during the filming of \"The Blob\", however, the production was cancelled and he was unexpectedly available to audition for \"The Blob\".\n\nProduction began on January 11, with the cast and crew of approximately 150 staying at a Travelodge in Abbeville, Louisiana. Due to the large amount of night shooting, the cast often slept during the day. On their off days, they watched videos at the hotel and ate crawfish, a popular item of local cuisine.\n\nSpecial effects in the film were handled by Tony Gardner. Gardner was originally supposed to provide only a few small effects, but after personnel changes he ended up running a crew of 33, including artist Chet Zar and mechanical effects designer Bill Sturgeon. Close's makeup for his role as Reverend Meeker required extensive preparation time: five-and-a-half hours for scenes where Meeker had fresh burns, and seven-and-a-half hours for scenes after his burns had healed.\n\nThe film functions as a conspiracy theory film. The threat of the original film was an alien entity from outer space. The remake differs in making the threat a biological weapon, created by a secret government agency. The Blob is closely followed by soldiers and scientists in protective suits. The change reflects the mentality of a more cynical era. The sinister government agents are opposed by rebellious teenager Brian Flagg (Kevin Dillon). His depiction as a rebel and a \"tough guy punk\" includes wearing a leather jacket, sporting long hair, riding a motorcycle, and distrusting authority figures.\n\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States by TriStar Pictures in August 1988.

Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film \"is more violent than the original, more spectacular, more cynical, more patently commercial and more attentive to detail\", but noted that \"for reasons having nothing to do with merit, the 1958 film earned a place in history. The remake, enterprising as it is, won't do the same\". \n\nChuck Bowen of \"Slant Magazine\" wrote that the film \"improves on the original cult classic with inventive, gracefully repulsive special effects and an agreeable post-Watergate anti-authoritarian message\". HorrorNews.net gave the film a score of \"4 1/2 out of 5\", writing that \"the twists that this film takes that differ from the original make it all the more terrifying and oddly enough... plausible\". TV Guide gave the film 3/5 stars, calling it \"a fine, multilayered effort from a director who understands the genre and appreciates its traditions\".\n\nThe film was released on DVD in the United States by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on September 11, 2001. Sony again released \"The Blob\" in September 2013 as part of its \"The 4-Movie Horror Unleashed Collection\", along with \"Fright Night\", \"Christine\" and \"The Seventh Sign\".

Pollock in his book \"How to Build a Person\" () to defend the idea of token physicalism, agent materialism, and strong AI. It ultimately illustrates what is needed for an Artificial Intelligence to be built and why humans are just like intelligent machines.\n\nOnce in a distant land there lived a race of Engineers. They have all their physical needs provided by the machines they have invented. One of the Engineers decide that he will create an \"intelligent machine\" that is much more ingenious than the more machines, in that it can actually sense, learn, and adapt to its environment as an intelligent animal.\n\nThe first version of the machine is called \"Oscar I\". It has pain sensors and \"fight-or-flight\" responses build within to help it survive hostile environment. In this stage Oscar I is much like the machines Hilary Putnam considers in 1960.\n\nIn order for Oscar I to avoid damages in hostile environment, it must not only be able to respond to its pain sensors but also predict what is likely to happen based on its generalization of its pain sensor activations. Therefore, a \"pain sensor sensor\" was built to sense its pain sensors, thus giving it a rudimentary self-awareness. In this stage Oscar I is much like an amoeba as Oscar II like a worm. Amoebas respond to pain while worms learn to avoid it.\n\nThe problem with Oscar II is that it has no conception if the environment is fooling him. For example, he can't distinguish if a machine-eating tiger and a mirror image of such tiger. To solve such problem, \"introspective sensors\" were built into Oscar II and made him \"Oscar III\". Oscar III can now sense the operation of its own sensors and form generalization about its reliability, thus acquired a higher degree of self-awareness. In this stage Oscar II is much like a bird as Oscar III a kitten. Kittens quickly learn about mirror image and come to ignore them while birds go on attacking their own reflection until they become exhausted.\n\nConsider a world populated by Oscarites. If the Oscarites are sufficiently intelligent, it can philosophizing the difference between their outward physical state and inward mental state. While we, from our perspective, describe the Oscarites as sensing the operation of their perceptual sensors, they describe it as they are \"being self-aware and being conscious\".\n\nIn the end of the fable Pollock states that while the Engineers are fictional, Oscar is real and we are in fact the Oscarites.\n\n\n"}

These fields include astrophysics, which has revealed how planets and stars form, interact, and die; particle physics, which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales; evolutionary biology, which predicts how life will evolve over time; and plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia. \n\nAll projections of the future of the Earth, the Solar System, and the universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must rise over time. Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out. Close encounters between astronomical objects gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.\n\nPhysicists expect that matter itself will eventually come under the influence of radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.\n\nThe timelines displayed here cover events from the beginning of the 11th millennium\nto the furthest reaches of future time. A number of alternative future events are listed to account for questions still unresolved, such as whether humans will become extinct, whether protons decay, and whether the earth survives when the sun expands to become a red giant.\n\nTo date five spacecraft (\"Voyager 1\", \"Voyager 2\", \"Pioneer 10\", \"Pioneer 11\" and \"New Horizons\") are on trajectories which will take them out of the Solar System and into interstellar space. Barring an extremely unlikely collision with some object, the craft should persist indefinitely.\n\nExtremely rare astronomical events beginning in the 11th millennium AD (year 10,001) will be:\n\nFor graphical, logarithmic timelines of these events see:\n\n"}

In 1978, he described a new disease, the . He introduced a method of psychotherapy and self-improvement based on optimistic autosuggestion for psychological rehabilitation of cardiosurgical patients (1979).\n\nFrom 1980 to 1990, he was professor of psychotherapy at the Kharkiv Medical Academy of Post-graduate Education. The main result of his scientific activity was the discovery of the \"syndrome of the neurotic phantom of somatic disease\" and a \"concept of the mental constituent of a chronic somatic disease\".\n\nFrom 1990 to 1994, Skumin held positions as Professor by the Chair of Psychology and Pedagogy, and Professor by the Chair of Physical Education and Health life at the Kharkiv State Academy of Culture. In 1994, he was elected to the post of the President-founder of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (Moscow). In 1995, Skumin became the first editor-in-chief of the journal . He is known for inventing a popular term \"Culture of Health\" (1968).\n\nBesides psychiatry and psychology, Skumin writes on healthy lifestyle, yoga, and philosophy. He co-authored series of illustrated books and articles on Agni Yoga, Rerikhism, Russian cosmism, Transhumanism, and New Age. He wrote books of fiction and lyrics for several songs.\n\nVictor Skumin was born on 30 August 1948 in Penza Oblast, RSFSR, where his father – Andrew Skumin () – was an officer of MGB of the USSR. After the birth of Victor, the family moved to the city of Kazan, where his father was appointed to the post of Chairman of the Military Tribunal of the Internal Troops of the Volga Military District. The family many times moved from one city to another, where Andrew Skumin was appointed to a new post. These cities, in particular, were Penza, Chelyabinsk, and Petrozavodsk. For this reason, he studied in various educational institutions.\n\nSkumin studied medicine at the Kharkiv National Medical University. The history of the higher medical school in Kharkiv is more than 200 years long and closely connected with the history of Vasily Karazin Kharkiv National University, because it sprang from its Medical Faculty. The University – one of the oldest University of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union – was founded in 1804, a decree about its foundation was signed by the Emperor of Russia Alexander I, and the first Statutes of the University were approved at that time. In the Kharkiv University were laid high scientific standards. Its history is connected with the names of the Nobel Laureates – Lev Landau, Simon Kuznets, Élie Metchnikoff – and other distinguished scientists.\n\nSkumin graduated the Medical University in 1973 with diploma with honours. In 1968, when he was still a medical student, he proposed the term ″Culture of Health″ (), which has become widespread. The main task of a Culture of Health is to implement innovative health programs that support a holistic approach to physical, mental and spiritual well-being.\n\nHe researched from 1976 to 1980 psychological and psychiatric problems of cardiac surgery under the mentorship of Nikolai Amosov, who was the founder and first director of the . This Institute was the first to conduct surgical treatment of heart diseases in the Ukrainian SSR (since 1955), the Institute began to conduct operations with extracorporeal circulation (1958), and mitral valve replacements (1963). In 1961, Amosov was awarded Lenin Prize for the work of surgery.\n\nSince a valve replacement is a heart surgical procedure, it requires placing the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass. With a valve replacement surgery, there are some risks. Skumin researched a neuropsychological and psychopathologic changes following open heart surgery, nonpsychotic mental disorders in patients with valvular heart disease before and after surgery, associated with mechanical artificial heart valve (MHV) implant.\n\nAn artificial heart valve is a device implanted in the heart of a patient with valvular heart disease, congenital heart defect, etc. When one or two of the four heart valves malfunctions, the medical choice may be to replace the natural valve with an artificial valve. There are three major types of mechanical valves with many modifications on these designs. This requires open heart surgery. The mechanical valves are made from metal and pyrolytic carbon, and can last a lifetime. All MHV function in the human body creating a unique sound effects and vibration. Patients with mechanical valves must take blood-thinning medications to prevent clotting. The choice of which valve type to use depends upon the patient's age, medical condition, preferences with medication, and lifestyle.\n\nThe Russia's international news agency \"RIA Novosti\", operating under the purview of the Russian Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, wrote about this problem (2014),\n\nThe methods and the main principles of such therapy and neuropsychological rehabilitation are described and its efficacy was demonstrated. Skumin proposed mixture subsequently named after him. () is a medicine with a sedative effect, affecting the central nervous system. It is used to treat Skumin syndrome, light forms of heart failure, anxiety and sleep disorders, and asthenia. The medicine is known to be well tolerated, with no contra-indications, except sensitivity. The formula contains Adonis vernalis, Crataegus, Valerian root, Leonurus cardiaca, Eucalyptus, Peppermint, and Rose hip.\n\nFor psychological rehabilitation, Skumin improved psychological function by calming the nervous system, enhancing relaxation, increasing body awareness and decreasing general anxiety.\n\nIn 1979, Skumin created a special modification of mind control method for psychological rehabilitation of cardiosurgical patients. This method is based on autogenic training. Autogenic training is a relaxation technique developed by the psychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz. He emphasized parallels to techniques in yoga and meditation. It is a method for influencing one's autonomic nervous system. The technique involves the daily practice of sessions that last around 15 minutes, usually in the morning, at lunch time, and in the evening. During each session, the practitioner will repeat a set of visualisations that induce a state of relaxation. Each session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures.\n\nThe technique of the () involves the use of two standard postures: sitting meditation and lying down meditation. This method of psychotraining includes five psychological exercises: the first is \"the relaxation\", the second one is \"the warming\", the third one is \"the zero gravity\", the fourth one is \"the target autosuggestion\", and the fifth exercise is \"the psychological activation\". Each session contain explanation of the theory and practice of each new exercise as it is reached. The therapeutic effect is achieved by the neutralization of traumatic emotional experiences and the progressive reorganization of the psychic structures to include previously unacceptable mental contents, too. This method of psychotherapy has found application in medical practice, in particular in the treatment of phobias, headaches, etc.\n\nSkumin's priority on the description of this syndrome and the establishment of effective methods of treatment and rehabilitation of cardiosurgical patients confirmed Nikolai Amosov and , Alain Carpentier, and many others. The Higher Attestation Commission under the USSR Council of Ministers awarded him for this research study the degree of Candidate of Sciences (1980). It is a first post-graduate scientific degree in some former Eastern Bloc countries.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1990, he worked as professor of psychotherapy at the Kharkiv Medical Academy of Post-graduate Education. During this period Skumin investigated mental health disorder in chronic diseases of the digestive system in children and adolescents.\nA most significant life event in the first years of life is a disease, especially if it is of early onset, severe, life-threatening, with an uncertain prognosis, and with the necessity of frequent diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Psychological implications are a significant part of the illness, not a marginal component; they can affect prognosis and outcome. Various laboratory tests, physical examinations, and surgeries on these individuals show no evidence supporting the idea that these exaggerating symptoms are present.\n\nIn particular, Skumin studied the patients, aged from 6 to 17, suffering from diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Most of them have revealed a negative psychological attitude to the dietotherapy they received. A system of special measures has been developed including three main elements: (1) psychotherapeutic mediation of dietotherapy before its administration and in the process of the therapy; (2) creation of the psychologic attitude to the diet adherence; (3) alteration of the patient's taste stereotype. Realization of such measures has been conducive to higher effectiveness of the dietotherapy.\n\nBased on studies into the mental sphere of gastroenterological patients, he systematized borderline neurotic and personality disorders on the clinical and etiopathogenetic basis. He studied the psychosocial problems that may affect children or teenagers who have the chronic gastrointestinal disease. A system of measures aimed at early diagnosis, correction, therapy and prophylaxis of borderline conditions and psychosocial readaptation of patients is scientifically based. The main result of his scientific activity was the discovery of the \"syndrome of the neurotic phantom of somatic disease\" (a specific psychopathological complex of symptoms) and a \"concept of the mental constituent of a chronic somatic disease\".\n\nSkumin defended his doctoral thesis in Moscow at the Serbsky State Scientific Center for Social and Forensic Psychiatry (1988). The Higher Attestation Commission awarded him for this research study the degree of Doktor Nauk in Medicine (Doctor of Medical Sciences – Dr.scient.med.). It is a higher doctoral degree which may be earned after the Candidate of Sciences (which is informally regarded in Russia and many other post-Soviet states as equivalent to PhD obtained in countries in which PhD is not the highest academic degree).\n\nFrom 1990 to 1994, Skumin held positions as Professor by the Chair of Psychology and Pedagogy, and Professor by the Chair of Physical Education and Health life at the Kharkiv State Academy of Culture. Skumin completed research of theoretical and practical issues of culture of health, which he developed throughout his scientific and pedagogical activity. These methods, he has introduced in the training course for the students of the Academy: \"The Foundations of a Culture of Health\".\n\nHis scientific and pedagogical work Skumin combine with a social activity. In 1994, he was elected to the post of the President-founder of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (WOCH) — International social movement \"To Health via Culture\" (). Coat of arms of the WOCH contain a symbol of Rerikhism.\nThe organization operates in accordance with the registered in Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation Charter. Key element of a Culture of Health is implement innovative health programs that support a holistic approach to physical, mental and spiritual well-being both inside and outside the workplace.\n\nIn the Russian Orthodox Church the social activities of this international organization qualifies as an ideology of the Living Ethics and New Age (NA),\n\nThe relationship between the Skumin's doctrine and Rerikhism is also confirmed by some scientists, such as Goraschuk V. P., Professor of H.S. Skovoroda Kharkiv National Pedagogical University. In 2004, he wrote in his thesis for a Doctor’s degree on speciality \"general pedagogics and history of pedagogics\",\n\nLiving Ethics (Agni Yoga) is a philosophical teaching which embraces all sides of being—from cosmological problems, down to daily human life. This teaching is based on the books written by Helena and Nicholas Roerich in the first half of the 20th century. The New Age movement is a spiritual movement that developed in Western nations during the 1970s. The movement is characterised by a holistic view of the cosmos, a belief in an emergent Age of Aquarius an emphasis on self-spirituality and the authority of the self, a focus on healing (particularly with alternative therapies).\n\nProfessor Verhorubova and professor Lobanova from Tomsk State Pedagogical University argued (2012) that in accordance with the concept of a culture of health, proposed by Skumin, the culture – spiritual, mental, and physical – determines the status of human health. And health – spiritual, mental, physical – is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture.\n\nThe essence of the teachings of the culture of health, reveals professor of University of Luhansk N. Gribok. He wrote at 2009,\n\nThe Culture of Health means recognizing health’s central importance in the lives. Expounding the philosophical aspects of his Doctrine of Culture of Health, Skumin referred to the works of Helena Blavatsky, Helena and Nicholas Roerich, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and Alexander Chizhevsky. In some of his publications, he argues that the Culture of Health will play an important role in the creation of a human spiritual society into the Solar System.\n\nHe elaborated on the theosophical conceptions of spiritual evolution and proposed (1990) a classification of Homo spiritalis (Latin: \"spiritual man\"), the sixth root race, consisting of eight sub-races (subspecies) – HS0 Anabiosis spiritalis, HS1 Scientella spiritalis, HS2 Aurora spiritalis, HS3 Ascensus spiritalis, HS4 Vocatus spiritalis, HS5 Illuminatio spiritalis, НS6 Creatio spiritalis, and HS7 Servitus spiritalis.\n\nSkumin wrote several books of fiction, and also essays.\n\nHe is the author of music and lyrics of several songs. Among them:\n\nIn 1995, Skumin became the first editor-in-chief (EIC) of the journal \"To Health via Culture\". This journal of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (″World Health Culture Organization″) received an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) 0204-3440. The main topics of the magazine are the dissemination of ideas of Culture of Health, holistic medicine, and Rerikhism.\n\nThe Organization also has its own publishing house (\"To Health via Culture\"), who has the right to publish the books with the International Standard Book Number (ISBN).\n\nSkumin wrote many books and articles on a variety medical and spiritual topics advocating a holistic approach to health. He is the author or co-author of a series illustrated books on the culture of health, yoga, and Rerikhism. He extols the value of spirituality.\n\n\n\n"}
