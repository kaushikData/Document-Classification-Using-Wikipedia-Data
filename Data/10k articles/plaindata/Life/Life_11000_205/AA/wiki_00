The technology enables the production of the four most important fuels (ethanol, gasoline, jet, and diesel fuel) using a proprietary process involving algae, sunlight, carbon dioxide and salt water.\n\nIn 2008 the company announced it would begin commercial production of Ethanol by 2009 in the Sonoran Desert in northwest Mexico. This seems not to have happened though and as of 2015 they are still not in commercial production. In October 2015 Paul Woods, the founder, resigned and the company announced they were laying off 25% of the staff and changing to a “water treatment and carbon capture now, and maybe fuels later” focus. In 2016, Algenol celebrated its 10th Anniversary and added algae-based sustainable products to its portfolio. Their name changed to Algenol Biotech LLC, and they are focusing on algae-based product development and manufacturing.\n\nAlgenol’s biofuel technology potentially allows production of the four most important fuels (ethanol, gasoline, jet, and diesel fuel) for around $1.27 per gallon each at production levels of 8,000 total gallons of liquid fuel per acre per year, but to date has not been successfully implemented in commercial production. Potentially the fuel would be produced with a 60% reduction in carbon footprint and could offer customers savings of 75 cents a gallon. The technology could produce high yields and relies on patented photobioreactors and proprietary downstream techniques for low-cost fuel production. These low-cost techniques consume carbon dioxide from industrial sources, do not use farmland or food crops, and provide fresh water. \nTheir biofuel technology uses sunlight, algae, non-arable land and carbon dioxide to produce ethanol and the leftover spent algae that can be converted into other biofuels. The technology uses blue-green algae (or cyanobacteria) to change CO2 and seawater into sugars and then into ethanol and biomass. The process is the only one that can convert more than 85% of its CO2 feedstock into the four fuels.\n\nAlgenol’s algae are non-invasive in natural habitats and the company has tested the algae repeatedly to ensure it is non-toxic, non-invasive, and are not plant pests\n\nAlgenol also offers its algae expertise to develop and manufacture products outside of biofuels. According to their website, they have the ability to develop: natural food colorants, bio-fertilizers, nutraceuticals, algae-based animal feed, and skin product additives.\n\nAlgenol's newest facility is located in Southwest Florida, just north of Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, and opened in October 2010. The new commercial development facility is working to create a commercially viable fuel from algae. The site features research labs including engineering facilities, advanced molecular biology, CO2 management, separations, and green chemistry advanced labs and an outdoor process development production unit on 40 acres. It is to cover 43,000sqft and to include of photobioreactors\nIn October 2011, Algenol began construction on a pilot-scale Integrated Biorefinery, allowing the company to work with algae from a single strain in the lab all the way to commercial-scale production. The Integrated Biorefinery, completed in 2012, demonstrates the commercial viability of the technology.\n\nAlgenol also has subsidiaries located in Berlin, Germany and Zug, Switzerland.\n\nAlgenol licenses the DIRECT TO ETHANOL® technology. One of these licenses is with BioFields S.A.P.I. de C.V. in Mexico. BioFields has access to over 42,000 acres of non-arable land in the Sonoran desert in Mexico. The area is close to waters for transportation and growing ethanol markets in South America. Another large partner of Algenol's is Reliance Industries Ltd. based in Mumbai India. Finally, Algenol has stated that they are discussing commercial \"Direct to Ethanol\" projects with several partners in the United States, South America, Israel, and Africa.\n\nAlgenol has a number of partners. Partners include the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, BioFields, Membrane Technology and Research, and Reliance Holdings USA, Inc. Algenol also is partnered with Lee County, Florida and the U.S. Department of Energy along with Universities including Florida Gulf Coast University, Georgia Tech, and Humboldt University of Berlin.\n\nIn December 2009, Algenol received a $25m United States Department of Energy grant to help build the Integrated Biorefinery Direct to Ethanol project in Lee County, Florida. Algenol also received a $10m grant from Lee County to employ people in Lee County and also build the Integrated Biorefinery Direct to Ethanol project.\n"}

His achievements over five decades rank him among the most successful left-handed golfers of all time, being the first lefty to win a golf major, winning more than 70 titles, and beating his age twice during a tournament as a 71-year-old.\n\nBorn in Carterton, a small town in the Wairarapa district in New Zealand's North Island, Charles lived in Masterton where he worked as a bank teller. He won the New Zealand Open at Heretaunga on 8 November 1954, as an 18-year-old amateur.\n\nCharles decided to hone his skills as an amateur first, and remained in his bank employment for a further six years. He represented New Zealand several times in international amateur tournaments during this period.\n\nCharles turned professional in 1960 and the next year won the New Zealand PGA Championship and soon after ventured overseas to the European and North American circuits.\n\nIn 1963, Charles won his first PGA Tour event in the United States, the Houston Classic, the first PGA Tour event won by a left-handed golfer. Later that year he won The Open Championship at Royal Lytham and St. Annes. After four rounds (68-72-66-71) his 277 was level with American Phil Rodgers. Charles won the 36-hole playoff by eight shots.\n\nCharles has won about 80 tournaments around the world. As well as his PGA Tour victories, his win in the 1969 World Matchplay Championship was considered one of his best. He won the Senior British Open 30 years after winning his British Open title. He remains, along with Michael Campbell, one of only two New Zealanders to win a men's major golf championship.\n\nIn 2007 Charles became the oldest golfer to make a cut on the European Tour at the Michael Hill New Zealand Open. Charles shot a 68 in the second round, beating his age by three strokes. He would go on to finish in a tie for 23rd place.\n\nCharles's move to the Senior PGA Tour (now called Champions Tour) was very lucrative and successful with 23 titles; and in three years 1988, 1989 and 1993, he recorded lowest scoring average. He finished second on the European Seniors Tour's 2007 Wentworth Senior Masters at the age of 71. He was the first left-hander to win a major, but also the first lefty to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame, in the veterans category. He was inducted in 2008. He would remain the only lefty inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame until Phil Mickelson was elected in 2011.\n\nAt the Senior British Open Championship in 2010, Charles announced in an ESPN interview that he would retire from golf, stating that he was \"74 years old, traveling this world for 50 years, and it's time to slow down and spend more time on my farm in New Zealand with my family.\"\n\nCharles is a sporting hero in New Zealand, not only for his achievements but also for his demeanour and philanthropy regarding junior golfers. He was also a role model worldwide for left-handed golfers. Until Canadian Mike Weir won The Masters in 2003, Charles was the only golfer with a left-handed swing to have won a major.\n\nIn the 1971 Queen's Birthday Honours, Charles was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to sport. In the 1992 New Year Honours, he was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to golf. In the 1999 New Year Honours, Charles was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to golf. In the 2011 New Year Honours 2011, Charles was appointed as a Member of the Order of New Zealand, New Zealand's highest civilian honour, for services to New Zealand.\n\nCharles married his wife Verity in 1962 and they have two children, Beverly and David. David is a golf director in the United States. He is a successful golf course designer having had major input into the Formosa Country Club east of Auckland, Millbrook at the resort town of Queenstown, and 'The Dunes' course at Matarangi on the Coromandel Peninsula.

She married Władysław on 9 August in Vienna by proxy, and then in Warsaw in person on 12 September 1637, and the same day was crowned at St. John's Cathedral. This was the first royal coronation outside of Kraków, the historic, former capital of Poland, and this greatly angered the Polish nobility. A law was instigated to reserve coronations to Kraków in 1638.\n\nYoung and energetic, she soon began organising the royal court to her liking. She was popular, especially for her politeness. One noble wrote in his memoirs that she insisted other women sit with her, even though she was queen. Cecilia could not remove her husband's mistress, Hedwig Łuszkowska, by herself, so she arranged a marriage between Hedwig and Starosta Merecki, John Wypyski. In 1638, Cecilia and Władysław visited Vienna.\n\nCecilia advocated the Habsburg and pro-Catholic point of view and allied herself with the pro-Habsburg faction of chancellor Jerzy Ossoliński and pro-Catholic Albrycht Stanisław Radziwiłł. Her political opponent at the court was the faction of Adam Kazanowski, whose influence over King Władysław, his childhood friend, diminished after her marriage. Kazanowski was allied with Chancellor Piotr Gembicki, who thus became one of her opponents.\nHer influence was strong for the first 2–3 years of marriage, and she had much to say about the royal nominations for important official positions. After 1638/1639 when Władysław realised that Habsburgs were prepared to give him little assistance, her power waned, and he started to disregard her advice.\n\nCecilia kept in contact with her brothers and continued an intimate attachment with them; she also became friends with her sister-in-law Anna Catherine. She enjoyed music, concerts, theatre performances and this may have greatly influenced her husband, who was one of the founders of Polish national theatre and brought many famous and well-known artists and performers from all around Europe to the country.\n\nDuring her marriage she became pregnant three times: Her first child, a son Sigismund Casimir was born on 1 April 1640 and died aged seven, on 9 August 1647; her second child, a daughter Maria Anna Isabella was born on 8 January 1642 and died one month later, on 7 February 1642. On 23 March 1644 Cecilia Renata gave birth her third child, a stillborn daughter. She died next day as a consequence of an infection, likely related to her recent childbirth. Following her sudden death, Cecilia Renata was deeply mourned by both Władysław and the Royal Polish court. She also left a good impression on the public, mostly for her piety and good will.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12197312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12197312", "title": "Chromatin remodeling", "text": "Chromatin remodeling\n\nChromatin remodeling is the dynamic modification of chromatin architecture to allow access of condensed genomic DNA to the regulatory transcription machinery proteins, and thereby control gene expression. Such remodeling is principally carried out by 1) covalent histone modifications by specific enzymes, e.g., histone acetyltransferases (HATs), deacetylases, methyltransferases, and kinases, and 2) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes which either move, eject or restructure nucleosomes. Besides actively regulating gene expression, dynamic remodeling of chromatin imparts an epigenetic regulatory role in several key biological processes, egg cells DNA replication and repair; apoptosis; chromosome segregation as well as development and pluripotency. Aberrations in chromatin remodeling proteins are found to be associated with human diseases, including cancer. Targeting chromatin remodeling pathways is currently evolving as a major therapeutic strategy in the treatment of several cancers.\n\nThe transcriptional regulation of the genome is controlled primarily at the preinitiation stage by binding of the core transcriptional machinery proteins (namely, RNA polymerase, transcription factors, and activators and repressors) to the core promoter sequence on the coding region of the DNA. However, DNA is tightly packaged in the nucleus with the help of packaging proteins, chiefly histone proteins to form repeating units of nucleosomes which further bundle together to form condensed chromatin structure. Such condensed structure occludes many DNA regulatory regions, not allowing them to interact with transcriptional machinery proteins and regulate gene expression. To overcome this issue and allow dynamic access to condensed DNA, a process known as chromatin remodeling alters nucleosome architecture to expose or hide regions of DNA for transcriptional regulation.\n\nBy definition, chromatin remodeling is the enzyme-assisted process to facilitate access of nucleosomal DNA by remodeling the structure, composition and positioning of nucleosomes.\n\nAccess to nucleosomal DNA is governed by two major classes of protein complexes:\n\nSpecific protein complexes, known as histone-modifying complexes catalyze addition or removal of various chemical elements on histones. These enzymatic modifications include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination and primarily occur at N-terminal histone tails. Such modifications affect the binding affinity between histones and DNA, and thus loosening or tightening the condensed DNA wrapped around histones, e.g., Methylation of specific lysine residues in H3 and H4 causes further condensation of DNA around histones, and thereby preventing binding of transcription factors to the DNA leading to gene repression. On contrary, histone acetylation relaxes chromatin condensation and exposes DNA for TF binding, leading to increase gene expression.\n\nWell characterized modifications to histones include:\nBoth lysine and arginine residues are known to be methylated. Methylated lysines are the best understood marks of the histone code, as specific methylated lysine match well with gene expression states. Methylation of lysines H3K4 and H3K36 is correlated with transcriptional activation while demethylation of H3K4 is correlated with silencing of the genomic region. Methylation of lysines H3K9 and H3K27 is correlated with transcriptional repression. Particularly, H3K9me3 is highly correlated with constitutive heterochromatin.\nAcetylation tends to define the ‘openness’ of chromatin as acetylated histones cannot pack as well together as deacetylated histones.\nHowever, there are many more histone modifications, and sensitive mass spectrometry approaches have recently greatly expanded the catalog.\n\nThe \"histone code\" is a hypothesis that the transcription of genetic information encoded in DNA is in part regulated by chemical modifications to histone proteins, primarily on their unstructured ends. Together with similar modifications such as DNA methylation it is part of the epigenetic code.\n\nCumulative evidence suggests that such code is written by specific enzymes which can (for example) methylate or acetylate DNA ('writers'), removed by other enzymes having demethylase or deacetylase activity ('erasers'), and finally readily identified by proteins (‘readers’) that are recruited to such histone modifications and bind via specific domains, e.g., bromodomain, chromodomain. These triple action of ‘writing’, ‘reading’ and ‘erasing’ establish the favorable local environment for transcriptional regulation, DNA-damage repair, etc.\n\nThe critical concept of the histone code hypothesis is that the histone modifications serve to recruit other proteins by specific recognition of the modified histone via protein domains specialized for such purposes, rather than through simply stabilizing or destabilizing the interaction between histone and the underlying DNA. These recruited proteins then act to alter chromatin structure actively or to promote transcription.\n\nA very basic summary of the histone code for gene expression status is given below (histone nomenclature is described here):\n\nATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes regulate gene expression by either moving, ejecting or restructuring nucleosomes. These protein complexes have a common ATPase domain and energy from the hydrolysis of ATP allows these remodeling complexes to reposition (slide, twist or loop) nucleosomes along the DNA, expel histones away from DNA or facilitate exchange of histone variants, and thus creating nucleosome-free regions of DNA for gene activation. Also, several remodelers have DNA-translocation activity to carry out specific remodeling tasks.\n\nThere are at least five families of chromatin remodelers in eukaryotes: SWI/SNF, ISWI, NuRD/Mi-2/CHD, INO80 and SWR1 with first two remodelers being very well studied so far, especially in the yeast model. Although all of remodelers share common ATPase domain, their functions are specific based on several biological processes (DNA repair, apoptosis, etc.). This is due to the fact that each remodeler complex has unique protein domains (Helicase, bromodomain, etc.) in their catalytic ATPase region and also has different recruited subunits.\n\n\nChromatin remodeling plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by providing the transcription machinery with dynamic access to an otherwise tightly packaged genome. Further, nucleosome movement by chromatin remodelers is essential to several important biological processes, including chromosome assembly and segregation, DNA replication and repair, embryonic development and pluripotency, and cell-cycle progression. Deregulation of chromatin remodeling causes loss of transcriptional regulation at these critical check-points required for proper cellular functions, and thus causes various disease syndromes, including cancer.\n\nChromatin relaxation is one of the earliest cellular responses to DNA damage. The relaxation appears to be initiated by PARP1, whose accumulation at DNA damage is half complete by 1.6 seconds after DNA damage occurs. This is quickly followed by accumulation of chromatin remodeler Alc1, which has an ADP-ribose–binding domain, allowing it to be quickly attracted to the product of PARP1. The maximum recruitment of Alc1 occurs within 10 seconds of DNA damage. About half of the maximum chromatin relaxation, presumably due to action of Alc1, occurs by 10 seconds. PARP1 action at the site of a double-strand break allows recruitment of the two DNA repair enzymes MRE11 and NBS1. Half maximum recruitment of these two DNA repair enzymes takes 13 seconds for MRE11 and 28 seconds for NBS1.\n\nAnother process of chromatin relaxation, after formation of a DNA double-strand break, employs γH2AX, the phosphorylated form of the H2AX protein. The histone variant H2AX constitutes about 10% of the H2A histones in human chromatin. γH2AX (phosphorylated on serine 139 of H2AX) was detected at 20 seconds after irradiation of cells (with DNA double-strand break formation), and half maximum accumulation of γH2AX occurred in one minute. The extent of chromatin with phosphorylated γH2AX is about two million base pairs at the site of a DNA double-strand break.\n\nγH2AX does not, by itself, cause chromatin decondensation, but within seconds of irradiation the protein “Mediator of the DNA damage checkpoint 1” (MDC1) specifically attaches to γH2AX. This is accompanied by simultaneous accumulation of RNF8 protein and the DNA repair protein NBS1 which bind to MDC1 as MDC1 attaches to γH2AX. RNF8 mediates extensive chromatin decondensation, through its subsequent interaction with CHD4 protein, a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex NuRD. CHD4 accumulation at the site of the double-strand break is rapid, with half-maximum accumulation occurring by 40 seconds after irradiation.\n\nThe fast initial chromatin relaxation upon DNA damage (with rapid initiation of DNA repair) is followed by a slow recondensation, with chromatin recovering a compaction state close to its predamage level in ∼ 20 min.\n\nChromatin remodeling provides fine-tuning at crucial cell growth and division steps, like cell-cycle progression, DNA repair and chromosome segregation, and therefore exerts tumor-suppressor function. Mutations in such chromatin remodelers and deregulated covalent histone modifications potentially favor self-sufficiency in cell growth and escape from growth-regulatory cell signals - two important hallmarks of cancer.\n\n\nRapid advance in cancer genomics and high-throughput ChIP-chip, ChIP-Seq and Bisulfite sequencing methods are providing more insight into role of chromatin remodeling in transcriptional regulation and role in cancer.\n\nEpigenetic instability caused by deregulation in chromatin remodeling is studied in several cancers, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer. Such instability largely cause widespread silencing of genes with primary impact on tumor-suppressor genes. Hence, strategies are now being tried to overcome epigenetic silencing with synergistic combination of HDAC inhibitors or HDI and DNA-demethylating agents.\nHDIs are primarily used as adjunct therapy in several cancer types. HDAC inhibitors can induce p21 (WAF1) expression, a regulator of p53's tumor suppressoractivity. HDACs are involved in the pathway by which the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) suppresses cell proliferation. Estrogen is well-established as a mitogenic factor implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of breast cancer via its binding to the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Recent data indicate that chromatin inactivation mediated by HDAC and DNA methylation is a critical component of ERα silencing in human breast cancer cells.\n\n\nCurrent front-runner candidates for new drug targets are Histone Lysine Methyltransferases (KMT) and Protein Arginine Methyltransferases (PRMT).\n\n\nAs pointed out by Liu et al., defects in DNA repair, with accumulation of DNA damage, underlie premature aging syndromes (also see DNA damage theory of aging). Deficiencies in chromatin remodeling, reducing DNA repair, appear to directly contribute to the process of aging.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8402086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8402086", "title": "Computational neurogenetic modeling", "text": "Computational neurogenetic modeling\n\nComputational neurogenetic modeling (CNGM) is concerned with the study and development of dynamic neuronal models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes. These include neural network models and their integration with gene network models. This area brings together knowledge from various scientific disciplines, such as computer and information science, neuroscience and cognitive science, genetics and molecular biology, as well as engineering.\n\nModels of the kinetics of proteins and ion channels associated with neuron activity represent the lowest level of modeling in a computational neurogenetic model. The altered activity of proteins in some diseases, such as the amyloid beta protein in Alzheimer's disease, must be modeled at the molecular level to accurately predict the effect on cognition. Ion channels, which are vital to the propagation of action potentials, are another molecule that may be modeled to more accurately reflect biological processes. For instance, to accurately model synaptic plasticity (the strengthening or weakening of synapses) and memory, it is necessary to model the activity of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). The speed at which the NMDA receptor lets Calcium ions into the cell in response to Glutamate is an important determinant of Long-term potentiation via the insertion of AMPA receptors (AMPAR) into the plasma membrane at the synapse of the postsynaptic cell (the cell that receives the neurotransmitters from the presynaptic cell).\n\nIn most models of neural systems neurons are the most basic unit modeled. In computational neurogenetic modeling, to better simulate processes that are responsible for synaptic activity and connectivity, the genes responsible are modeled for each neuron.\n\nA gene regulatory network, protein regulatory network, or gene/protein regulatory network, is the level of processing in a computational neurogenetic model that models the interactions of genes and proteins relevant to synaptic activity and general cell functions. Genes and proteins are modeled as individual nodes, and the interactions that influence a gene are modeled as excitatory (increases gene/protein expression) or inhibitory (decreases gene/protein expression) inputs that are weighted to reflect the effect a gene or protein is having on another gene or protein. Gene regulatory networks are typically designed using data from microarrays.\n\nModeling of genes and proteins allows individual responses of neurons in an artificial neural network that mimic responses in biological nervous systems, such as division (adding new neurons to the artificial neural network), creation of proteins to expand their cell membrane and foster neurite outgrowth (and thus stronger connections with other neurons), up-regulate or down-regulate receptors at synapses (increasing or decreasing the weight (strength) of synaptic inputs), uptake more neurotransmitters, change into different types of neurons, or die due to necrosis or apoptosis. The creation and analysis of these networks can be divided into two sub-areas of research: the \ngene up-regulation that is involved in the normal functions of a neuron, such as growth, metabolism, and synapsing; and the effects of mutated genes on neurons and cognitive functions.\n\nAn artificial neural network generally refers to any computational model that mimics the central nervous system, with capabilities such as learning and pattern recognition. With regards to computational neurogenetic modeling, however, it is often used to refer to those specifically designed for biological accuracy rather than computational efficiency. Individual neurons are the basic unit of an artificial neural network, with each neuron acting as a node. Each node receives weighted signals from other nodes that are either excitatory or inhibitory. To determine the output, a transfer function (or activation function) evaluates the sum of the weighted signals and, in some artificial neural networks, their input rate. Signal weights are strengthened (long-term potentiation) or weakened (long-term depression) depending on how synchronous the presynaptic and postsynaptic activation rates are (Hebbian theory).\n\nThe synaptic activity of individual neurons is modeled using equations to determine the temporal (and in some \ncases, spatial) summation of synaptic signals, membrane potential, threshold for action potential \ngeneration, the absolute and relative refractory period, and optionally ion receptor channel kinetics and Gaussian noise (to increase biological accuracy by incorporation of random elements). In addition to connectivity, some types of artificial neural networks, such as spiking neural networks, also model the distance between neurons, and its effect on the synaptic weight (the strength of a synaptic transmission).\n\nFor the parameters in the gene regulatory network to affect the neurons in the artificial neural network as intended there must be some connection between them. In an organizational context, each node (neuron) in the artificial neural network has its own gene regulatory network associated with it. The weights (and in some networks, frequencies of synaptic transmission to the node), and the resulting membrane potential of the node (including whether an action potential is produced or not), affect the expression of different genes in the gene regulatory network. Factors affecting connections between neurons, such as synaptic plasticity, can be modeled by inputting the values of synaptic activity-associated genes and proteins to a function that re-evaluates the weight of an input from a particular neuron in the artificial neural network.\n\nOther cell types besides neurons can be modeled as well. Glial cells, such as astroglia and microglia, as well as endothelial cells, could be included in an artificial neural network. This would enable modeling of diseases where pathological effects may occur from sources other than neurons, such as Alzheimer's disease.\n\nWhile the term artificial neural network is usually used in computational neurogenetic modeling to refer to models of the central nervous system meant to possess biological accuracy, the general use of the term can be applied to many gene regulatory networks as well.\n\nArtificial neural networks, depending on type, may or may not take into account the timing of inputs. Those that do, such as spiking neural networks, fire only when the pooled inputs reach a membrane potential is reached. Because this mimics the firing of biological neurons, spiking neural networks are viewed as a more biologically accurate model of synaptic activity.\n\nTo accurately model the central nervous system, creation and death of neurons should be modeled as well. To accomplish this, constructive artificial neural networks that are able to grow or shrink to adapt to inputs are often used. Evolving connectionist systems are a subtype of constructive artificial neural networks (evolving in this case referring to changing the structure of its neural network rather than by mutation and natural selection).\n\nBoth synaptic transmission and gene-protein interactions are stochastic in nature. To model biological nervous systems with greater fidelity some form of randomness is often introduced into the network. Artificial neural networks modified in this manner are often labeled as probabilistic versions of their neural network sub-type (e.g., pSNN).\n\nFuzzy logic is a system of reasoning that enables an artificial neural network to deal in non-binary and linguistic variables. Biological data is often unable to be processed using Boolean logic, and moreover accurate modeling of the capabilities of biological nervous systems requires fuzzy logic. Therefore, artificial neural networks that incorporate it, such as evolving fuzzy neural networks (EFuNN) or Dynamic Evolving Neural-Fuzzy Inference Systems (DENFIS), are often used in computational neurogenetic modeling. The use of fuzzy logic is especially relevant in gene regulatory networks, as the modeling of protein binding strength often requires non-binary variables.\n\nArtificial Neural Networks designed to simulate of the human brain require an ability to learn a variety of tasks that is not required by those designed to accomplish a specific task. Supervised learning is a mechanism by which an artificial neural network can learn by receiving a number of inputs with a correct output already known. An example of an artificial neural network that uses supervised learning is a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In unsupervised learning, an artificial neural network is trained using only inputs. Unsupervised learning is the learning mechanism by which a type of artificial neural network known as a self-organizing map (SOM) learns. Some types of artificial neural network, such as evolving connectionist systems, can learn in both a supervised and unsupervised manner.\n\nBoth gene regulatory networks and artificial neural networks have two main strategies for improving their accuracy. In both cases the output of the network is measured against known biological data using some function, and subsequent improvements are made by altering the structure of the network. A common test of accuracy for artificial neural networks is to compare some parameter of the model to data acquired from biological neural systems, such as from an EEG. In the case of EEG recordings, the local field potential (LFP) of the artificial neural network is taken and compared to EEG data acquired from human patients. The relative intensity ratio (RIRs) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the EEG are compared with those generated by the artificial neural networks to determine the accuracy of the model.\n\nBecause the amount of data on the interplay of genes and neurons and their effects is not enough to construct a rigorous model, \nevolutionary computation is used to optimize artificial neural networks and gene regulatory networks, a common technique being the genetic algorithm. A genetic algorithm is a process that can be used to refine models by mimicking the process of natural selection observed in biological ecosystems. The primary advantages are that, due to not requiring derivative information, it can be applied to black box problems and multimodal optimization. The typical process for using genetic algorithms to refine a gene \nregulatory network is: first, create a population; next, to create offspring via a crossover operation and \nevaluate their fitness; then, on a group chosen for high fitness, simulate mutation via a mutation operator; \nfinally, taking the now mutated group, repeat this process until a desired level of fitness is demonstrated.\nMethods by which artificial neural networks may alter their structure without simulated mutation and fitness selection have been developed. A dynamically evolving neural network is one approach, as the creation of new connections and new neurons can \nbe modeled as the system adapts to new data. This enables the network to evolve in modeling accuracy without simulated natural selection. One method by which dynamically evolving networks may be optimized, called evolving layer neuron aggregation, combines neurons with sufficiently similar input weights into one neuron. This can take place during the training of the network, referred to as online aggregation, or between periods of training, referred to as offline aggregation. Experiments have suggested that offline aggregation is more efficient.\n\nA variety of potential applications have been suggested for accurate computational neurogenetic models, such as simulating genetic diseases, examining the impact of potential treatments, better understanding of learning and cognition, and development of hardware able to interface with neurons.\n\nThe simulation of disease states is of particular interest, as modeling both the neurons and their genes and proteins allows linking genetic mutations and protein abnormalities to pathological effects in the central nervous system. Among those diseases suggested as being possible targets of computational neurogenetic modeling based analysis are epilepsy, schizophrenia, mental retardation, brain aging and Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.\n\n\n"}

The term \"computational thinking\" was first used by Seymour Papert in 1980 and again in 1996. Computational thinking can be used to algorithmically solve complicated problems of scale, and is often used to realize large improvements in efficiency.\n\nThe phrase \"computational thinking\" was brought to the forefront of the computer science community as a result of an ACM Communications essay on the subject by Jeannette Wing. The essay suggested that thinking computationally was a fundamental skill for everyone, not just computer scientists, and argued for the importance of integrating computational ideas into other disciplines.\n\nThe characteristics that define computational thinking are decomposition, pattern recognition / data representation, generalization/abstraction, and algorithms. By decomposing a problem, identifying the variables involved using data representation, and creating algorithms, a generic solution results. The generic solution is a generalization or abstraction that can be used to solve a multitude of variations of the initial problem.\n\nAnother characterization of computational thinking is the \"three As\" iterative process based on three stages:\n\nThe four Cs of 21st century learning are communication, critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity. The fifth C could be computational thinking which entails the capability to resolve problems algorithmically and logically. It includes tools that produce models and visualize data. Computational thinking is applicable across subjects beyond science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) which include the social sciences and language arts. Students can engage in activities where they identify patterns in grammar as well as sentence structure and use models for studying relationships.\n\nSince its inception, the 4 Cs have gradually gained acceptance as vital elements of many school syllabi. This development triggered a modification in platforms and directions such as inquiry, project-based, and more profound learning across all K-12 levels. Many countries have introduced computer thinking to all students. The United Kingdom has CT in its national curriculum since 2012. Singapore calls CT as “national capability”. Other nations like Australia, China, Korea, and New Zealand embarked on massive efforts to introduce computational thinking in schools. In the United States, President Barack Obama created this program, Computer Science for All to empower this generation of students in America with the proper computer science proficiency required to flourish in a digital economy. Computational thinking means thinking or solving problems like computer scientists. CT refers to thought processes required in understanding problems and formulating solutions. CT involves logic, assessment, patterns, automation, and generalization. Career readiness can be integrated into learning and teaching environments in multiple ways.\n\nJeannette Wing envisioned computational thinking becoming an essential part of every child's education. However, since her article (published in 2006) integrating computational thinking into the K-12 curriculum has faced several challenges including the agreement on the definition of computational thinking. Currently, computational thinking is broadly defined as a set of cognitive skills and problem solving processes that include (but are not limited to) the following characteristics:\n\n\nCurrent integration computational thinking into the K-12 curriculum comes in two forms: in computer science classes directly or through the use and measure of computational thinking techniques in other subjects. Teachers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) focused classrooms that include computational thinking, allow students to practice problem-solving skills such as trial and error (Barr, et al., 2011). Valerie Barr and Chris Stephenson describe computational thinking patterns across disciplines in a 2011 ACM Inroads article However Conrad Wolfram has argued that computational thinking should be taught as a distinct subject.\n\nCarnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh has a Center for Computational Thinking. The Center's major activity is conducting PROBEs or PROBlem-oriented Explorations. These PROBEs are experiments that apply novel computing concepts to problems to show the value of computational thinking. A PROBE experiment is generally a collaboration between a computer scientist and an expert in the field to be studied. The experiment typically runs for a year. In general, a PROBE will seek to find a solution for a broadly applicable problem and avoid narrowly focused issues. Some examples of PROBE experiments are optimal kidney transplant logistics and how to create drugs that do not breed drug-resistant viruses.\n\nThere are a handful of on-line institutions which provide curriculum, and other related resources to build and strengthen pre-college students with computational thinking, analysis and problem-solving. One prominent one is the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy. It offers training sessions for both pre-college students, as well as teachers. CMU's programs exercise instructional scaffolding methods via engineering process. There is also another online site named legoengineering.com. offering similar resources.\n\nAs far as a physical facility, in Central New Jersey, there is a small institution, named Storming Robots, offering technology programs to Grade 4 to 12 with an emphasis on algorithmic and computational thinking via robotics projects throughout the school year. Students may follow its road map starting from Grade 4 until they graduate to college.\n\nDesigned to increase the use of computational thinking, computationalthinking.org was launched to provide problem-solving resources to various sectors in an effort to increase the use of computational thinking. The resources include ready-made courses and materials for professionals, colleges, schools, and students. The services also include advising policymakers and governments on education reform and curriculum development.\n\nThe concept of computational thinking has been criticized as too vague, as it's rarely made clear how it is different from other forms of thought. Some computer scientists worry about the promotion of computational thinking as a substitute for a broader computer science education, as computational thinking represents just one small part of the field. Others worry that the emphasis on Computational Thinking encourages computer scientists to think too narrowly about the problems they can solve, thus avoiding the social, ethical and environmental implications of the technology they create.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10508019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10508019", "title": "Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton", "text": "Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton\n\nElizabeth Hamilton (née Schuyler ; August 9, 1757 – November 9, 1854), also called \"Eliza\" or \"Betsey\", was co-founder and deputy director of an orphanage in New York City. She was the wife of American founding father Alexander Hamilton.\n\nElizabeth was born in Albany, New York, the second daughter of Continental Army General Philip Schuyler, a Revolutionary War general, and Catherine Van Rensselaer Schuyler. The Van Rensselaers of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck were one of the richest and most politically influential families in the state of New York. She had seven siblings who lived to adulthood, including Angelica Schuyler Church and Margarita \"Peggy\" Schuyler Van Rensselaer, and 14 siblings in total.\n\nHer family was among the wealthy Dutch landowners who had settled around Albany in the mid-1600s, and both her mother and father came from wealthy and well-regarded families. Like many landowners of the time, Philip Schuyler owned slaves, and Eliza would have grown up around slavery. Despite the unrest of the French and Indian War, which her father served in and which was fought in part very near her childhood home, Eliza's childhood was spent comfortably, learning to read and sew from her mother.\n\nLike most Dutch families of the area, her family belonged to the Reformed Dutch Church of Albany, which still survives, though the original 1715 building where Elizabeth was baptized and attended services was demolished in 1806. Her upbringing instilled in her a strong and unwavering faith she would retain throughout her life.\n\nWhen she was a girl, Elizabeth accompanied her father to a meeting of the Six Nations and met Benjamin Franklin when he stayed briefly with the Schuyler family while traveling. She was said to have been something of a tomboy when she was young; throughout her life she retained a strong will and even an impulsiveness that her acquaintances noted. James McHenry, one of Washington's aides alongside her future husband, would say that \"Hers was a strong character with its depth and warmth, whether of feeling or temper controlled, but glowing underneath, bursting through at times in some emphatic expression.\" Much later, the son of Joanna Bethune, one of the women she worked alongside to found an orphanage later in her life, remembered that \"Both [Elizabeth and Joanna] were of determined disposition ... Mrs. Bethune the more cautious, Mrs. Hamilton the more impulsive.\"\n\nIn early 1780, Elizabeth went to stay with her aunt, Gertrude Schuyler Cochran, in Morristown, New Jersey. There she met Alexander Hamilton, one of General George Washington's aides-de-camp, who was stationed along with the General and his men in Morristown for the winter. (In fact, they had met previously, if briefly, two years before, when Hamilton dined with the Schuylers on his way back from a negotiation on Washington's behalf.) Also while in Morristown, Eliza met and became friends with Martha Washington, a friendship they would maintain throughout their husbands' political careers. Eliza later said of Mrs. Washington, \"She was always my ideal of a true woman.\"\n\nThe relationship between Eliza and Hamilton quickly grew, even after he left Morristown for a short mission to negotiate a prisoners exchange, only a month after Eliza had arrived. He then returned to Morristown where Elizabeth's father had also arrived in his capacity as representative of the Continental Congress and by early April they were officially engaged, with her father's blessing (something of an anomaly for the Schuyler girls—both Angelica and Catherine would end up eloping). Hamilton followed the Army when they decamped in June 1780. In September that year, Eliza learned that Major John André, head of the British Secret Service, had been captured in a foiled plot concocted by General Benedict Arnold to surrender the fort of West Point to the British. André had once been a houseguest in the Schuyler Mansion in Albany as a prisoner of war en route to Pennsylvania in 1775; Eliza, then seventeen, might have had a juvenile crush on the young British officer who had once sketched for her. Hamilton, while jealous of André for his \"accomplishments,\" promised Eliza he would do what he could to treat the British intelligence chief accordingly; he even begged Washington to grant André's last wish of execution by firing squad, but to no avail. After two more months of separation punctuated by their correspondence, on December 14, 1780, Alexander Hamilton and Elizabeth Schuyler were married at the Schuyler Mansion.\n\nAfter a short honeymoon at the Pastures, Eliza's childhood home, Hamilton returned to military service in early January 1781. Eliza soon joined him at New Windsor, where Washington's army was now stationed, and she rekindled her friendship with Martha Washington as they entertained their husbands' fellow officers. Soon, however, Washington and Hamilton had a falling-out, and the newlywed couple relocated first back to Eliza's father's house in Albany, then to a new home across the river from the New Windsor headquarters. There Eliza busied herself in creating a home for them and in aiding Alexander with his political writings—parts of his thirty-one-page letter to Robert Morris, laying out much of the financial knowledge that was to aid him later in his career, are written in her handwriting.\n\nSoon, however, Eliza would relocate again, this time back to her parents' house in Albany. This possibly coincided with the discovery that she was pregnant with her first child, who would be born the next January and named Philip, for her father. While apart, Alexander wrote her numerous letters telling her not to worry for his safety; in addition, he wrote her concerning confidential military secrets, including the lead-up to the Battle of Yorktown that autumn. Meanwhile, the war would come close to home, after British soldiers attempted to raid the Pastures. According to some accounts, the family was spared from any harm, thanks to her sister Peggy's quick thinking when she said her father had gone to town to get help, causing the raiders to flee.\n\nAfter Yorktown, Alexander was able to rejoin Eliza in Albany, where they would remain for almost another two years, before moving to New York City in late 1783. Earlier that year, Angelica and her husband John Barker Church, for business reasons, had moved to Europe. Angelica lived abroad for over fourteen years, returning to America for visits in 1785 and 1789. On September 25, 1784, Eliza gave birth to her second child, Angelica, named after Eliza's older sister.\n\nIn 1787, Eliza sat for a portrait, executed by the painter Ralph Earl while he was being held in debtors' prison. Alexander had heard of Earl's predicament and asked if Eliza might be willing to sit for him, to allow him to make some money and eventually buy his way out of prison, which he subsequently did. At this time, she now had three young children (her third, Alexander, was born in May 1786) and may have been pregnant at the time with her fourth, James Alexander, who would be born the following April.\n\nIn addition to their own children, in 1787, Eliza and Alexander took into their home Frances (Fanny) Antill, the two-year-old youngest child of Hamilton's friend Colonel Edward Antill, whose wife had recently died. In October that year, Angelica wrote to Alexander, \"All the graces you have been pleased to adorn me with fade before the generous and benevolent action of my sister in taking the orphan Antle under her protection.\" Two years later, Colonel Antill died in Canada, and Fanny continued to live with the Hamiltons for another eight years, until an older sister was married and able to take Fanny into her own home. Later, James Alexander Hamilton would write that Fanny \"was educated and treated in all respects as [the Hamiltons'] own daughter.\"\n\nThe Hamiltons had an active social life, often attending the theater as well as various balls and parties. \"I had little of private life in those days,\" she would remember. At the first Inaugural Ball, Eliza danced with George Washington; when Thomas Jefferson returned from Paris in 1790, she and Alexander hosted a dinner for him. After Alexander became Treasury Secretary in 1789, her social duties only increased: \"Mrs. Hamilton, Mrs. [Sarah] Jay and Mrs. [Lucy] Knox were the leaders of official society,\" an early historian writes. In addition, she managed their household, and James McHenry once noted to Alexander that Eliza had \"as much merit as your treasurer as you have as treasurer of the United States.\"\n\nEliza also continued to aid Alexander throughout his political career, serving as an intermediary between him and his publisher when he was writing \"The Federalist Papers\", copying out portions of his defense of the Bank of the United States, and sitting up with him so he could read Washington's Farewell Address out loud to her as he wrote it. Meanwhile, she continued to raise her children (a fifth, John Church Hamilton, had been born in August 1792) and maintain their household throughout multiple moves between New York, Philadelphia, and Albany. While in Philadelphia, around November 24, 1794, Eliza suffered a miscarriage in the wake of her youngest child falling extremely ill as well as of her worries over Hamilton's absence during his armed suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion. Hamilton resigned from public office immediately afterwards in order to resume his law practice in New York and remain closer to his family.\n\nIn 1797, an affair came to light that had taken place several years earlier between Hamilton and Maria Reynolds, a young woman who had first approached him for monetary aid in the summer of 1791. Eliza evidently did not believe the charges when they were first leveled against her husband: John Church, her brother-in-law, on July 13, 1797, wrote to Hamilton that \"it makes not the least Impression on her, only that she considers the whole Knot of those opposed to you to be [Scoundrels].\" After returning home to Eliza on July 22 and assembling a first draft dated July 1797, On August 25, 1797, Hamilton published a pamphlet, later known as the Reynolds Pamphlet, admitting to his one-year adulterous affair in order to refute the charges that he had been involved in speculation and public misconduct with Maria's husband James Reynolds.\n\nEliza was at the time pregnant with their sixth child. Despite her advanced pregnancy and her previous miscarriage of November 1794, her initial reaction to her husband's disclosure of his past affair was to leave Hamilton in New York and join her parents in Albany where William Stephen was born on August 4, 1797. She only came back to her marital house in New York in early September 1797 because the local doctor had been unable to cure their eldest son Philip, who had accompanied her to Albany and contracted typhus. Over time Eliza and Alexander reconciled and remained married, and had two more children together. The first, Elizabeth, named for Eliza, was born on November 20, 1799. Before their eighth child was born, however, they lost their oldest son, Philip, who died in a duel on November 24, 1801. After being shot on the dueling field, Philip was brought to Angelica and John Church's house, where he died, both of his parents next to him. Their last child, born the next June in 1802, was named Philip in his honor.\n\nOnly two years later, in July 1804, Alexander Hamilton became involved in a similar \"affair of honor,\" which led to his infamous duel with Aaron Burr and untimely death. Before the duel, he wrote Eliza two letters, telling her: \n\nThe consolations of Religion, my beloved, can alone support you; and these you have a right to enjoy. Fly to the bosom of your God and be comforted. With my last idea; I shall cherish the sweet hope of meeting you in a better world. Adieu best of wives and best of Women. Embrace all my darling Children for me. \n\nAlexander Hamilton died on July 12, 1804, with Eliza and all seven of his surviving children by his side.\n\nIn the year before the duel, Eliza's mother Catherine had died suddenly, and only a few months after Hamilton's death Eliza's father died as well. By this time, two of her siblings, Peggy and John, had also died.\n\nAfter her husband's death in 1804, Eliza was left to pay Hamilton's debts. The Grange, their house on a 35-acre estate in upper Manhattan, was sold at public auction; however, she was later able to repurchase it from Hamilton's executors, who had decided that Eliza could not be publicly dispossessed of her home, and purchased it themselves to sell back to her at half the price. In November 1833, at the age of 76, Eliza resold The Grange for $25,000, funding the purchase of a New York townhouse (now called the Hamilton-Holly House) where she lived for nine years with two of her grown children, Alexander Hamilton Jr. and Eliza Hamilton Holly, and their spouses. In 1848, she left New York for Washington, D.C., where she lived with her widowed daughter Eliza until 1854.\n\nIn 1798, Eliza had accepted her friend Isabella Graham's invitation to join the descriptively named Society for the Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children that had been established the previous year. In 1806, two years after her husband's death, she, along with several other women including Joanna Bethune, founded the Orphan Asylum Society. Eliza was appointed second directress, or vice-president. In 1821, she was named first directress, and served for twenty-seven years in this role, until she left New York in 1848. By the time she left she had been with the organization continuously since its founding, a total of forty-two years. The New York Orphan Asylum Society continues to exist as a social service agency for children, today called Graham Windham.\n\nEliza defended Alexander against his critics in a variety of ways following his death, including by supporting his claim of authorship of George Washington's Farewell Address and by requesting an apology from James Monroe over his accusations of financial improprieties.\n\nEliza remained dedicated to preserving her husband's legacy. She re-organized all of Alexander's letters, papers, and writings with the help of her son, John Church Hamilton, and persevered through many setbacks in getting his biography published. She was so devoted to Alexander's writings that she wore a small package around her neck containing the pieces of a sonnet which Alexander wrote for her during the early days of their courtship. Even in her nineties, she remained dedicated to charity work, and after moving to Washington, D.C., she helped Dolley Madison and Louisa Adams raise money to build the Washington Monument.\nBy 1846, Eliza was suffering from short-term memory loss but was still vividly recalling her husband. Eliza died in Washington, D.C. on November 9, 1854, at age ninety-seven. She had outlived her husband by fifty years, and had outlived all but one of her siblings (her youngest sister, Catherine, twenty-four years her junior). Eliza was buried near her husband in the graveyard of Trinity Church in New York City. Angelica was also laid to rest at Trinity, in the Livingstons' private vault, while Eliza's eldest son Philip had an unmarked grave near the churchyard.\n\nElizabeth and Alexander Hamilton had eight children:\n\nThe Hamiltons also raised Frances (Fanny) Antill, an orphan who lived with them for ten years beginning in 1787 when she was two years old.\n\n"}

During his tenure, he oversaw some of the most complex projects the Bureau of Reclamation has undertaken. These included the Hoover, Grand Coulee and Owyhee dams.\n\nMead was born in Patriot, Indiana, and graduated from Purdue with a Bachelor of Science in 1882. He worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Indianapolis for seven months and departed for Fort Collins, Colorado, by the end of the year. \n\nThere he started work as a professor by teaching mathematics at Colorado Agricultural College from 1883 until 1884, and again from 1886 to 1888. He developed and taught the first class on irrigation engineering in the United States. Mead also worked for the Colorado State Engineer's Office.\n\nIn 1888, Mead became the territorial and state engineer of Wyoming. From 1888 until 1899, he was key in drafting the water laws for Wyoming. He was also a key supporter of the Cody Canal, one of the nation's first Carey Act projects undertaken by a group of investors, including William F. Cody.\n\nIn 1899, Mead was appointed head of irrigation investigations for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based out of Cheyenne. There he had an important role of directing irrigation studies across the west.\n\nIn 1907, Mead was appointed Chairman of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria, Australia. He served there for four years, though the Australian records show that he continued to work there until May, 1915.\n\nIn 1911, he returned to the United States to become the professor of Rural Institutions, University of California, and chairman of the California Land Settlement Board. His ideas about developing efficient rural communities would later influence what would become the Resettlement Administration communities of the New Deal.\nHe continued to serve in California until 1924, when he was appointed Chairman of the Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) by President Calvin Coolidge's administration. In 1923 and again in 1927, he went to Palestine to help the Zionists develop irrigation and development plans. At the USBR, Mead oversaw the planning and execution of construction of major water control and irrigation projects in the West: the Hoover, Grand Coulee and Owyhee dams.\n\nMead died on January 26, 1936, at the age of 78 in Washington, D.C., from thrombosis, just four months after the completion of Boulder Dam. Originally interred at Abbey Mausoleum, he was reburied at National Memorial Park in Falls Church, Virginia, in 2001 after the former crypt closed and was demolished.\n\nLake Mead, formed by the construction of the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River, was named after Mead. He is also the namesake to the SS \"Elwood Mead\", a Liberty ship which was launched in 1944.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1014333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1014333", "title": "Flood (Halo)", "text": "Flood (Halo)\n\nThe Flood are fictional parasitic alien life forms in the \"Halo\" video game series created by Bungie. They are introduced in \"\" as a second enemy faction alongside the Covenant; they return in later entries in the series such as \"Halo 2\", \"Halo 3\", and \"Halo Wars\". The Flood are driven by a desire to infect any sentient life they encounter, and are depicted as such a threat that the ancient Forerunners killed themselves and all other sentient life in the galaxy in an effort to stop the Flood.\n\nThe Flood's design and fiction was spearheaded by Bungie artist Robert McLees, who utilized unused concepts from the earlier Bungie game \"Marathon 2\". The setting of the first game, the ringworld Halo, was stripped of many of its large creatures to make the Flood's appearance more startling. Bungie environment artist Vic DeLeon spent six months of pre-production time refining the Flood's fleshy aesthetic and designing the organic interiors of Flood-infested space ships for \"Halo 3\".\n\nThe player's discovery of the Flood in \"Halo: Combat Evolved\" is a major plot twist, and was one of the surprises reviewers noted positively upon release. The Flood's return in \"Halo 2\" and \"Halo 3\" was less enthusiastically praised. Reaction to the Flood has varied over the years; while some found the Flood too derivative and a cliché element of science fiction, some others ranked them among the greatest villains of all time.\n\nThe Flood are depicted as parasitic organisms that infect any sentient life of sufficient size. The largest self-contained form that the Flood can produce itself without using other biomass is an \"infection form\". These forms seeks hosts living or dead, attempting to drive sharp spines into the host and tap into the nervous system. The host is incapacitated while the infection form burrows into the host's body and begins the mutation process, bringing the host under Flood control. Depending on the size or condition of the body, the infection form mutates the hapless host into various specialized forms in the continual drive for more food. Larger hosts are seen turned into forms for combat, growing long whiplike tentacles, while mangled and disused hosts are turned into incubators for more infection forms. The Flood also create forms such as a central intelligence or \"Gravemind\" to drive the infestation.\n\nThe Flood were added early in the development of the 2001 video game \"\", before the game had made its jump from the Macintosh platform to the Xbox. A design for one Flood form appeared as early as 1997. Commenting upon the inception of the Flood, Bungie staff member Chris Butcher noted that \"the idea behind the Flood as the forgotten peril that ended a galaxy-spanning empire is a pretty fundamental tenet of good sci-fi. Yeah, and bad sci-fi too.\" Another inspiration was Christopher Rowley's \"The Vang\" series. The early design for the Flood was done by Bungie artist and writer Robert McLees, who considers himself \"the architect\" of the Flood; the Flood's roots are reflected in concept art of a \"fungal zombie\" that McLees did for the earlier Bungie game \"\". McLees also did all the early concept art for the Flood.\n\nBased on the behavior of viruses and certain bacteria, the Flood were intended to be \"disgusting and nasty\". The creatures were constructed from the corpses and bodies of former combatants, so the artists had to make sure the Flood soldiers were recognizable while changing their silhouette enough to differentiate them from the uninfected. Many concepts and ideas were discarded due to time constraints—initially, the Flood were intended to convert any species of the alien Covenant into soldiers. \"We didn't have the resources to make it happen,\" McLees recalled, so they modified the game's fiction to suggest that some Covenant were too small or too frail to be combat troops. Likewise, the Flood enemy intelligence was intended to be as complicated as that of the other enemy faction in the game, the Covenant, but full implementation was cut for time. The dinosaur-like terrestrial wildlife that originally dwelled in Halo's environments were dropped due to gameplay constraints and fear that their pretense would reduce the surprise and impact of the Flood.\n\nBungie decided a new visual language for the Flood was needed for \"Halo 3\". The task of developing the new Flood forms, organic Flood terrain, and other miscellaneous changes fell to Vic DeLeon, then Bungie's Senior Environment Artist. Early concepts of what became new Flood types in the game called \"pure forms\" featured the creatures wielding an array of weapons via tendrils, while forms like the Flood Infector and Flood Transport concepts never made it into the final game. Flood-infested structures were designed as angular to counterbalance Flood biomass, as well as provide surfaces for the game's artificial intelligence to exploit and move on. New additions were designed to be multi-purpose; exploding \"growth pods\" that spew Flood forms were added to the game to adjust pacing, provide instant action, and add to the visuals. Endoscopic pictures provided further inspiration. \"Halo 3\" added new capabilities to the Flood, including the ability for the parasite to infect enemies in real time. Bungie used \"Halo 3\"s improved capacity for graphics to make a host's sudden transformation into Flood form more dramatic; two different character models and skeletons were fused and swapped in real-time.\n\nThe Flood make their first appearance more than halfway through \"Halo: Combat Evolved\", during the story mission \"343 Guilty Spark\". A group of humans fleeing the enemy aliens Covenant land on \"Halo\", a ringworld built by the alien Forerunners. The human commander Jacob Keyes disappears in a swamp while searching for a weapons cache. The artificial intelligence Cortana sends the supersoldier Master Chief to find Keyes. The Master Chief discovers that the Covenant have accidentally released the Flood. Keyes' squad is turned into soldiers for the parasite, while Keyes is interrogated by the Flood in an attempt to learn the location of Earth and ultimately assimilated. The emergence of the Flood prompts Halo's caretaker artificial intelligence 343 Guilty Spark to enlist the help of the Master Chief in activating Halo's defenses and preventing a Flood outbreak. When Master Chief learns that activating Halo would instead wipe the galaxy of sentient life to prevent the Flood's spread, he and Cortana instead detonates the human ship \"Pillar of Autumn\"s engines, destroying the ring and preventing the Flood from escaping.\n\nThe Flood return in \"Halo 2\" (2004), appearing on Installation 05 or \"Delta Halo\". The Flood on Delta Halo are led by the Gravemind, a massive Flood intelligence that dwells in the bowels of the ring. Gravemind brings together the Master Chief and the Arbiter and tasks them with stopping the Covenant leadership from activating the ring. In the meantime, Gravemind infests the human ship \"In Amber Clad\" and crashes it into the Covenant space station of \"High Charity\". Once there, the Flood sweep through the city, and the Gravemind captures Cortana. As the Flood spread, the Covenant form a blockade in an effort to prevent the parasite from leaving its prison.\n\nThe Flood reappear in the \"Halo 3\" mission \"Floodgate\", on board a damaged ship that escapes the quarantine around Delta Halo. While the infestation of Earth is prevented, Master Chief and Arbiter form a tenuous alliance with the Flood to stop the activation of all the Halo rings at the Forerunner installation known as the Ark. Once the threat is stopped, the Gravemind turns on them. The Master Chief fights his way to the center of \"High Charity\", freeing Cortana and destroying the city, but Gravemind attempts to rebuild himself on a Halo under construction at the Ark. Realizing that activating the ring will destroy only the local Flood infestation due to the Ark's location outside of the Milky Way, the Master Chief, Arbiter, Cortana and Sergeant Johnson proceed to Halo's control room, activate the ring, and escape. However, the Gravemind warns them that his defeat will only delay the Flood, not stop it.\n\nThe Flood also make appearances in the video game spinoffs \"Halo Wars\" and \"Halo Wars 2\". In \"Halo Wars\", they are encountered infesting a Forerunner installation and ultimately annihilated by the actions of the crew of the humans ship \"Spirit of Fire\". In the \"Halo Wars 2\" expansion \"Awakening the Nightmare\", the alien faction known as the Banished accidentally release the Flood while salvaging the wreck of \"High Charity\".\n\nThe 2006 anthology \"The Halo Graphic Novel\" expands upon the Flood's release from Halo in two stories. The first, \"Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor\", takes place at the same time as the Master Chief hunts for Keyes during \"Halo: Combat Evolved\". The Flood manage to pilot a Covenant dropship off Halo, and infest a Covenant ship, \"Infinite Succor\". The Flood are stopped by a Covenant strike team led by Rtas 'Vadumee, who sets the ship on a course into the nearby sun. The second story, \"Breaking Quarantine\", details the escape of Sergeant Avery Johnson from the clutches of the Flood, immediately after Keyes' squad is overrun. Whereas the Flood are only hinted at being intelligent in \"Halo: Combat Evolved\", the \"Halo Graphic Novel\" shows the Flood have a hive mind, assimilating the knowledge of their hosts rapidly. Lee Hammock, writer of \"The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor\", described the basis of the story as a way to showcase the true danger of the Flood as an intelligent menace, rather than something the player encounters and shoots. Hammock also stated that the story would prove the intelligent nature of the Flood, and \"hopefully euthanize the idea that they are just space zombies\".\n\nThe Flood also feature heavily in Greg Bear's trilogy of novels, The Forerunner Saga, which takes place thousands of years before the events of \"Halo: Combat Evolved\". It is revealed in the novel \"Halo: Silentium\" that the Flood are what remains of the Precursors, an ancient race that was said to accelerate the evolution of a species and \"shape galaxies\". The Forerunners overthrew the Precursors; on the verge of extinction, some Precursors reduced themselves to a biological powder that would regenerate into their past selves. However, time rendered the powder defective, and it became mutagenic, reacting with other living organisms to produce what would eventually mutate into the Flood. The Flood would threaten both ancient humanity and then the Forerunners, who would ultimately build and activate the Halo Array to stop the spread of the Flood.\n\nThe Flood have been featured in four series of \"Halo\" action figures, produced by Joyride Studios. For \"Halo: Combat Evolved\", Joyride produced a Carrier Form and Infection form bundle. \"Halo 2\"s series contains both a human Combat Form and Infection form (bundled with the Master Chief), which were released after the video game. Reviewer Aaron Simmer of Armchair Empire.com expressed the sentiment that Joyride's models could not totally capture the ghoulishness texture and detail of the Flood. The action figures for \"Halo 3\" were produced by McFarlane Toys and although the first series did not feature the Flood, the third series featured a human Combat Form.\n\nThe surprise appearance of the Flood during \"Halo: Combat Evolved\" was seen as an important plot twist and a scary moment even after repeat playthroughs of the game. Gamasutra, writing about video game plots, gives the example of the Flood not only as an important reversal to the story of \"Halo\", but a textbook example of how games and their stories are made more interesting by twists in the plot. \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Kotaku\" credited the appearance of the Flood as an excellent way the game kept players on their toes, forcing them to adjust their strategies; \"Rolling Stone\" called the twist as shocking \"as if, several levels into a game of Pac-Man, the dots suddenly began to attack you\". \n\nDespite the positive acclaim in \"Halo\", the response to the presence of the Flood in \"Halo 2\" and \"Halo 3\" was mixed. A panel of online reviewers noted that the Flood appeared in \"Halo 2\" for no obvious reasons, and were simply described as \"aggravating\" to play against. Similarly, reviewers including Victor Godinez of \"The Dallas Morning News\" felt that the Flood were too derivative of other sci-fi stereotypes, and functioned as \"space zombies\". Daniel Weissenberger of Gamecritics.com noted in his review of \"Halo 3\" that even though the Flood looked better than ever, their single strategy of rushing the player proved tedious over time. GamesRadar's Charlie Barratt listed the Flood as the worst part of \"Halo\", contrasting what he considered fun, vibrant and open levels before the Flood's appearance with confined spaces and predictable enemies.\nThe Flood have been recognized as some of the greatest game villains. \"Wizard Magazine\" ranked the Flood as the 77th Greatest Villains of all time, Game Daily ranked them 5th of their \"Top 25 Enemies of All Time\", and \"PC World\" ranked the Flood the 31st \"Most Diabolical Video-Game Villains of All Time\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" ranked the Flood in their top ten list of \"badass undead\". MTV considered Flood possession in \"Halo 3\" as a \"great gaming moment\" of 2007, stating that \"with the power of the Xbox 360's graphics, this reanimation comes to vivid, distressing life, more memorably than it had in the earlier games. Here are the zombies of gaming doing what they do worst. [...] It's grisly and unforgettable.\" IGN listed the Flood as the 45th best video game villain, describing them as one of the most hated video game villains in the history of video games.\n\n"}

The Civille family of Rouen was of Spanish origin.\n\nFrançois de Civille was a soldier in the French Wars of Religion. He wrote a memoir describing being found dead, buried, and resuscitated at the siege of Rouen in 1562. He was shot in the head and fell from the ramparts into the ditch, where workers buried him on 12 October 1562. Civille's groom went to collect the body to bury it properly and found he was still alive. During his recovery, soldiers looking for his younger brother discovered him in bed and threw him out of the window. He landed in a dung heap in the courtyard where he remained senseless in his night clothes for three days until he was found by his cousin. His injuries left him unable to close his mouth without pain. Subsequently, Civille would write \"Dead, Buried, Resuscitated\" under his signature. Civille wrote a memoir of his 1562 experience and had it printed in 1606. Pierre de L'Estoile noted its publication in July 1606. In a later addition to the story, it was said that Civille died after falling a third time, falling ill on an icy night while peeping into a neighbour's window.\n\nAs a diplomat he worked for Françoise de Bourbon, Duchess of Bouillon and was an informant for Francis Walsingham, reporting on English visitors at Rouen, and declared that he was as sure and constant in Walsingham's service 'as a diamond is hard'. He sent gifts of dried fruit, apples and pears, to Ursula St Barbe and Lettice Knollys, the wives of Walsingham and Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. He came to London and met Elizabeth I in 1584 and 1588. He and his wife, Jehanne du Mouchet, and family came to Rye in July 1585 and were listed as Protestant refugees in London in January 1586.\n\nIn 1588, Elizabeth gave him a jewel and her portrait, according to an inscription on a painting belonging to his descendants. Leaving his wife in London, he travelled to Edinburgh in March 1589 to raise an army of 3000 soldiers for Henri of Navarre and work on the unsuccessful negotiations for the marriage of James VI of Scotland to Catherine de Bourbon sister of Henri of Navarre. James was advised of Civille's mission by Henri's letter of 23 December 1588. James married Anne of Denmark instead. Civille mentioned in a letter from Wemyss that the Earl of Huntingdon was his 'old and gracious master'. Civille left Scotland in September 1589 accompanied by Sir James Colville of Easter Wemyss.\n\nIn January 1598 Henri IV ordered Civille as \"Commissaire Ordinaire des Guerres\" to take command of troops at Saumur.\n\n\nSee also \n"}

They are eager to take one last run down the mountain before they go home; however, the ski resort decides to close early because a storm is moving in.\n\nThe friends convince the ski lift attendant to let them on one last time. Before the group gets all the way to the top, the attendant is called into the boss's office and is replaced by a co-worker. As he leaves, he tells the co-worker that there are only three skiers left. Another set of three skiers comes down the mountain. When he sees them, he shuts down the ski lift, stranding the three friends in their ski lift chair far above the ground.\n\nThey take it as a joke, but the ski resort's lights are then turned off, leaving the three friends in fear and shock. Parker knows the ski slopes have closed for the week. Dan feels he has no choice but to jump from the ski lift chair and get help, as they will not survive up there in the bitter cold until Friday.\n\nAfter discussing the danger, Dan decides to jump off the lift. Upon hitting the ground, he suffers a compound fracture on both of his legs. Soon, his screams and the scent of blood attracts a pack of wolves. Joe, now fearing for Dan's safety, decides to try to get to the ground by traversing the suspension cable between the lifts and steel support tower. However, as wolves close in on Dan, he returns to the chair and holds Parker as Dan is brutally torn apart by the wolves.\n\nIn the morning, Parker awakes with her hand frozen on the bar, which she grabbed during her sleep. She is also suffering severe frostbite. Joe discusses his previous life experiences with her, before attempting to traverse the ski lift cable, and onto a support pole on the other side. By doing this, he also causes the chair Parker is sitting in to dangerously loosen from the cable. After scaring off a pair of wolves by using a ski pole, he slides down the mountain on Parker's snowboard, planning to return with help. The wolves give chase after him. Joe never returns and Parker spends the night alone on the loose cable.\n\nThe next day, Parker begins to climb out of the lift, but the screw comes loose and causes the lift to fall. Blocked by a cable, the lift is hanging a few meters above the ground. Parker jumps and then the lift lands on her ankle. Injured, she begins to slide and crawl down the mountain. She encounters the wolves feasting on Joe's mutilated corpse. Too occupied with Joe's corpse, they ignore her as she continues down, eventually crawling to a nearby road.\n\nThe first car that passes doesn't see her but soon a minivan appears and the driver, seeing her outstretched body lying in the snow along the side of the road, stops to assist her. The film ends with the driver saying they are going to a nearby hospital, followed by Parker closing her eyes.\n\n\"Frozen\" was filmed at Snowbasin near Ogden, Utah, in February 2009 and distributed by Anchor Bay Entertainment.\n\nThe film premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.

He refutes the effectiveness of torture, citing its negative long-term effects such as recruiting for Al-Qaeda. He also argues that torture is contrary to the American principles of freedom, liberty, and justice, and that should they resort to torture, American interrogators become the enemy they serve to defeat. Similar arguments have been made by other former interrogators from the U.S. military, FBI, and the CIA, including Colonel Steven Kleinman. In an interview with human rights lawyer Scott Horton for Harper's Magazine, Alexander said\n\nAlexander described Marc Thiessen's 2010 book \"Courting Disaster\", which defended the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, as 'a literary defense of war criminals'.\n"}
{"id": "3877892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3877892", "title": "Human enhancement", "text": "Human enhancement\n\nHuman enhancement is \"any attempt to temporarily or permanently overcome the current limitations of the human body through natural or artificial means. It is the use of technological means to select or alter human characteristics and capacities, whether or not the alteration results in characteristics and capacities that lie beyond the existing human range.\"\n\nHuman enhancement technologies (HET) are techniques that can be used not simply for treating illness and disability, but also for enhancing human characteristics and capacities. The expression \"human enhancement technologies\" is relative to emerging technologies and converging technologies. In some circles, the expression \"human enhancement\" is roughly synonymous with human genetic engineering, it is used most often to refer to the general application of the convergence of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science (NBIC) to improve human performance. \nAccording to the National Intelligence Council's Global Trends 2030 report, \"human augmentation could allow civilian and military people to work more effectively, and in environments that were previously inaccessible\". It states that \"future retinal eye implants could enable night vision, and neuro-enhancements could provide superior memory recall or speed of thought. Neuro-pharmaceuticals will allow people to maintain concentration for longer periods of time or enhance their learning abilities. Augmented reality systems can provide enhanced experiences of real-world situations.\"\n\nIn terms of technological enhancements, Kevin Warwick lists the possibilities as enhanced memory, enhanced communication, enhanced senses, multi-dimensional thinking, extending the body, in built machine thinking, outsourcing memory, enhanced maths + speed of thinking + problem solving., He also states that \"a person's brain and body do not have to be in the same place\".\n\n\n\n\nThere are many substances that are purported to have promise in augmenting human cognition by various means. These substances are called nootropics and can potentially benefit individuals with cognitive decline and many different disorders, but may also be capable of yielding results in cognitively healthy persons. Some examples of these include Huperzine A, Phosphatidylserine, Bacopa monnieri, Gotu Kola, Acetyl-l-Carnitine, Uridine monophosphate, L-theanine, Rhodiola rosea, and Pycnogenol which are all forms of dietary supplement. There are also nootropic drugs such as Noopept (Omberacetam), Semax, and N-Acetyl Semax. There are also nootropics related to naturally occurring substances but that are either modified in a lab or are analogs such as Vinpocetine and Sulbutiamine. Additionally, some substances can be inhaled for a potential nootropic benefit such as Rosemary essential oil which shows potential for aiding memory and affecting mood.\n\nWhile in some circles the expression \"human enhancement\" is roughly synonymous with human genetic engineering, it is used most often to refer to the general application of the convergence of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science (NBIC) to improve human performance.\n\nSince the 1990s, several academics (such as some of the fellows of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies) have risen to become advocates of the case for human enhancement while other academics (such as the members of President Bush's Council on Bioethics) have become outspoken critics.\n\nAdvocacy of the case for human enhancement is increasingly becoming synonymous with \"transhumanism\", a controversial ideology and movement which has emerged to support the recognition and protection of the right of citizens to either maintain or modify their own minds and bodies; so as to guarantee them the freedom of choice and informed consent of using human enhancement technologies on themselves and their children.\nNeuromarketing consultant Zack Lynch argues that neurotechnologies will have a more immediate effect on society than gene therapy and will face less resistance as a pathway of radical human enhancement. He also argues that the concept of \"enablement\" needs to be added to the debate over \"therapy\" versus \"enhancement\".\n\nAlthough many proposals of human enhancement rely on fringe science, the very notion and prospect of human enhancement has sparked public controversy.\n\nDale Carrico wrote that \"human enhancement\" is a loaded term which has eugenic overtones because it may imply the improvement of human hereditary traits to attain a universally accepted norm of biological fitness (at the possible expense of human biodiversity and neurodiversity), and therefore can evoke negative reactions far beyond the specific meaning of the term. Furthermore, Carrico wrote that enhancements which are self-evidently good, like \"fewer diseases\", are more the exception than the norm and even these may involve ethical tradeoffs, as the controversy about ADHD arguably demonstrates.\n\nHowever, the most common criticism of human enhancement is that it is or will often be practiced with a reckless and selfish short-term perspective that is ignorant of the long-term consequences on individuals and the rest of society, such as the fear that some enhancements will create unfair physical or mental advantages to those who can and will use them, or unequal access to such enhancements can and will further the gulf between the \"haves\" and \"have-nots\". Futurist Ray Kurzweil has shown some concern that, within the century, humans may be required to merge with this technology in order to compete in the marketplace.\n\nOther critics of human enhancement fear that such capabilities would change, for the worse, the dynamic relations within a family. Given the choices of superior qualities, parents make their child as opposed to merely birthing it, and the newborn becomes a product of their will rather than a gift of nature to be loved unconditionally. This is problematic because it could harm the unconditional love a parent could give their child, and it could furthermore lead to serious disappointment if the child does not fulfill its engineered role.\n\nAccordingly, some advocates, who want to use more neutral language, and advance the public interest in so-called \"human enhancement technologies\", prefer the term \"enablement\" over \"enhancement\"; defend and promote rigorous, independent safety testing of enabling technologies; as well as affordable, universal access to these technologies.\n\nSome believe that the ability to enhance one's self would reflect the overall goal of human life: to improve fitness and survivability. They claim that it is human nature to want to better ourselves via increased life expectancy, strength, intelligence and overall independence. In our world, there always have been stratification among socioeconomic classes that prevent the less wealthy from accessing the best options for goods and opportunities, and so would also restrict access to the best enhancements or prevent them from accessing them at all. The advantage gained by one person's enhancements implies a disadvantage to an weakly enhanced or unenhanced person. Human enhancements present a great debate on the equality between the individuals throughout the socioeconomic spectrum.\n\nThe enhancement of the human body could have profound changes to everyday situations. Sports, for instance, would change dramatically if enhanced people were allowed to compete; there would be a clear disadvantage for those who are not enhanced. In regards to economic programs, human enhancements would greatly increase life expectancy which would require employers to either adjust their pension programs to compensate for a longer retirement term, or delay retirement age. When considering birth rates into this equation, if there is no decline with increased longevity, this could put more pressure on resources like energy and food availability if there is no enhancement for human efficiency. A job candidate enhanced with a neural transplant that heightens their ability to compute and retain information would outcompete someone who is not enhanced. A person with a hearing or sight enhancement could intrude on privacy laws or expectations in an environment like a classroom or workplace. These enhancements could go undetected and give individuals an overall advantage. However, since restrictions have always existed for any kind of procedure involving children, this might prevent this from affecting schools and competitive junior activities.\n\nUnfairness in those who receive enhancements and those who do not is a cause for concern, although unfairness is inevitable in any field or situation. An individual taking a math exam may have had a better teacher, or a greater access to information with a modern handheld device. There also exists the stochastic \"genetic lottery\" of nature. The long-term physical advantage through genetic engineering or short-term cognitive advantage of nootropics may be part of a greater issue, the real issue being that of availability. How easy it is for certain individuals to get a hold of such enhancements depending on their socioeconomic standing. With all technologies it is important to keep in mind the historical trends of technology that relate utility to availability.\n\nGeoffrey Miller claims that 21st century Chinese eugenics may allow the Chinese to increase the IQ of each subsequent generation by five to fifteen IQ points, and after a couple generations it \"would be game over for Western global competitiveness.\" Miller recommends that the Western world put aside its \"self-righteous\" Euro-American ideological biases and learn from the Chinese.\n\nHuman enhancement technologies can impact human identity by affecting one's self-conception. This is problematic because enhancement technologies threaten to alter the self fundamentally to the point where the result is a different person. For example, extreme changes in personality may affect the individual's relationships because others can no longer relate to the new person.\n\nIn his essay \"Mapping human enhancement rhetoric\", Thayer (2014) states that the growth of human enhancement technology means a corresponding growth in the discourse of HET, so he suggests inventing a new classification called Human Enhancement Rhetoric (HER). To establish this classification, Thayer focuses on answering four existential questions: (1) what is HER?, (2) how can HER be mapped?, (3) what does this project of mapping HER accomplish?, and (4) what global issues or ethical concerns are raised, or can be further understood, by mapping HER? These foundational questions serve to introduce Thayer's newly conceived boundaries, definitions, nomenclature, and ethical arguments as he works to create a discourse that industry professionals and academics can study, navigate, and grow.\n\nIn addition to the issues listed in the ethics section, the enhancement technologies should be sufficiently robust to prevent hacking and interference of human augmentation.\n\n"}

The field of anthropometrics (human measurement) has unanswered questions, but it's still true that human physical characteristics are fairly predictable and objectively measurable. Buildings scaled to human physical capabilities have steps, doorways, railings, work surfaces, seating, shelves, fixtures, walking distances, and other features that fit well to the average person.\n\nHumans also interact with their environments based on their sensory capabilities. The fields of human perception systems, like perceptual psychology and cognitive psychology, are not exact sciences, because human information processing is not a purely physical act, and because perception is affected by cultural factors, personal preferences, experiences, and expectations. So human scale in architecture can also describe buildings with sightlines, acoustic properties, task lighting, ambient lighting, and spatial grammar that fit well with human senses. However, one important caveat is that human perceptions are always going to be less predictable and less measurable than physical dimensions.\n\nHuman scale in architecture is deliberately violated:\n\n\n\"Common sense\" ideas tend to relate to events within human experience, and thus commensurate with these scales. There is thus no commonsense intuition of, for example, interstellar distances or speeds approaching the speed of light.\n\nWeights and measures tend to reflect human scale, and many older systems of measurement featured units based directly on the dimensions of the body, such as the foot and the cubit. The metric system, which is based on precisely reproducible and measurable physical quantities such as the speed of light, still attempts to keep its base units within the range of human experience. Systems of natural units (such as Planck units) are useful in theoretical physics, but are not suitable for everyday purposes; because the SI units are defined in terms of constants of nature they can be thought of as natural units rescaled to human proportions.\n\n"}

{"id": "3841210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3841210", "title": "Immurement", "text": "Immurement\n\nImmurement (from Latin \"im-\" \"in\" and \"murus\" \"wall\"; literally \"walling in\") is a form of imprisonment, usually for life, in which a person is placed within an enclosed space with no exits. This includes instances where people have been enclosed in extremely tight confinement, such as within a coffin. When used as a means of execution, the prisoner is simply left to die from starvation or dehydration. This form of execution is distinct from being buried alive, in which the victim typically dies of asphyxiation.\n\nSome examples of immurement as an established execution practice (with death from thirst or starvation as the intended aim) are attested. Roman Vestal Virgins could face immurement as punishment if they broke their vows of chastity, and immurement has been well established as a punishment of robbers in Persia, even into the early 20th century. Some ambiguous evidence exists of immurement as a practice of coffin-type confinement in Mongolia.\n\nHowever, isolated incidents of immurement, rather than elements of continuous traditions, are attested or alleged from numerous parts of the world as well, and some of these notable incidents are included. Instances of immurement as an element of massacre within the context of war or revolution are also noted. Immuring living persons as a type of human sacrifice is also reported, for example, as part of grand burial ceremonies in some cultures.\n\nAs a motif in legends and folklore, many tales of immurement exist. In the folklore, immurement is prominent as a form of capital punishment, but its use as a type of human sacrifice to make buildings sturdy has many tales attached to it as well. Skeletal remains have been, from time to time, found behind walls and in hidden rooms and on several occasions have been asserted to be evidence of such sacrificial practices or of such a form of punishment.\n\nThere is a difference between a form of execution established as a tradition (for example, one crystallized into formal law), and isolated incidents of immurement. This section illustrates that distinction. Furthermore, incidents at war time are explored separately.\n\nThe Vestal Virgins in ancient Rome constituted a class of priestesses whose principal duty was to maintain the sacred fire dedicated to Vesta (goddess of the home and the family), and they lived under a strict vow of chastity and celibacy. If that vow of chastity was broken, the offending priestess was immured alive as follows:\n\nThe order of the Vestal Virgins existed for about 1,000 years, but only about 10 effected immurements are attested in extant sources.\n\nA tradition existed in Persia of walling up criminals and leaving them to die of hunger or thirst. The traveller M. A. Hume-Griffith stayed in Persia from 1900 to 1903, and she wrote the following:\n\nTravelling back and forth to Persia from 1630 to 1668 as a gem merchant, Jean Baptiste Tavernier observed much the same custom that Hume-Griffith noted some 250 years later. Tavernier notes that immuring was principally a punishment for thieves, and that immurement left the convict's head out in the open. According to him, many of these individuals would implore passersby to cut off their heads, an amelioration of the punishment forbidden by law. John Fryer, travelling Persia in the 1670s writes the following:\nStaying as a diplomat in Persia from 1860–63, E. B. Eastwick met at one time, the Sardar i Kull, or military high commander, Aziz Khan. Eastwick notes that he \"did not strike me as one who would greatly err on the side of leniency\". Eastwick was told that just recently, Aziz Khan had ordered 14 robbers walled up alive, two of them head-downwards. Staying for the year 1887–1888 primarily in Shiraz, Edward Granville Browne noted the gloomy reminders of a particularly bloodthirsty governor there, Firza Ahmed, who in his four years of office (ending \"circa\" 1880), had caused, for example, more than 700 hands cut off for various offences. Browne continues:\n\nImmurement was practiced in Mongolia as recently as the early 20th century. It is not clear that all thus immured were meant to die of starvation. In a newspaper report from 1914, it is written:\n\nThe Neo-Assyrian Empire is infamous for its brutal repression techniques, not the least of those reasons being because several of its rulers congratulated themselves upon the vengeance they wrought by going into detail of how they dealt with their enemies. Here is a commemoration Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883–859 BC) made that includes immurement:\nIn book 3 of his \"History of the Peloponnesian War\", Thucydides goes into great detail on the revolution that broke out at Corfu in 427 BC. Book three, chapter 81, passage five reads as follows:\nLivilla, a member of the imperial dynasty under Emperor Tiberius, was condemned in AD 31 for being complicit in the plot Sejanus staged to overthrow the Emperor. According to Cassius Dio, Tiberius handed Livilla over to her mother, Antonia Minor, who locked her own daughter in the bedroom, ensuring that she starved to death.\n\nFlavius Basiliscus, emperor in the Eastern Roman Empire from AD 475-476, was deposed. In winter he was sent to Cappadocia with his family, where they were imprisoned in either a dry cistern, or a tower, and perished. The historian Procopius said they died exposed to cold and hunger, while other sources, such as Priscus, merely speaks of death by starvation.\n\nThe patriarch of Aquileia, Poppo of Treffen (r. 1019–1045) was a mighty secular potentate, and in 1044 he sacked Grado. The newly elected Doge of Venice, Domenico I Contarini, captured him and allegedly let him be buried up to his neck, and left guards to watch over him until he died.\n\nMaud de Braose and her son, William, were imprisoned and starved to death under John, King of England, after de Braose accused John of murdering his nephew.\nIn 1149 Duke Otto III of Olomouc of the Moravian Přemyslid dynasty immured the abbot Deocar and 20 monks in the refectory in the monastery of Rhadisch, where they starved to death. Ostensibly this was because one of the monks had fondled his wife Duranna when she had spent the night there. However, Otto III confiscated the monastery's wealth, and some said this was the motive for the immurement.\n\nThe actual punishment meted out to men found guilty of paederasty (homosexual intercourse with boys) might vary between different status groups. In 1409 and 1532 in Augsburg, two men were burned alive for their offences, but a rather different procedure was meted out to four clerics in the 1409 case, guilty of the same offence. Instead of being burned alive, they were locked into a wooden casket that was hung up in the Perlachturm, and they starved to death.\n\nAfter confessing in an Inquisition Court to an alleged conspiracy involving lepers, the Jewry, the King of Granada and the Sultan of Babylon, Guillaume Agassa, head of the leper asylum at Lestang, was condemned in 1322 to be immured in shackles for life.\n\nHungarian countess Elizabeth Báthory de Ecsed (\"Báthory Erzsébet\" in Hungarian; 7 August 1560 – 21 August 1614) was immured in a set of rooms in 1610 for the death of several girls, with figures being as high as several hundred, though the actual number of victims is uncertain. Being labeled the most prolific female serial killer in history has earned her the nickname of the \"Blood Countess\", and she is often compared with Vlad III the Impaler of Wallachia in folklore. She was allowed to live in immurement until she died, four years after being sealed, ultimately dying of causes other than starvation; evidently her rooms were well supplied with food.\n\nIn the late 1650s, various sons of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan became embroiled in wars of succession, in which Aurangzeb was victorious. One of his half-brothers, Shah Shujah proved particularly troublesome, but in 1661 Aurangzeb defeated him, and Shah Shuja and his family sought the protection of the King of Arakan. According to Francois Bernier, the King reneged on his promise of asylum, and Shuja's sons were decapitated, while his daughters were immured, and died of starvation.\n\nJezzar Pasha, the Ottoman governor of provinces in modern Lebanon, and Palestine from 1775 to 1804, was infamous for his cruelties. When building the new walls of Beirut, he was charged, inter alia, with the following:\nIn a newspaper clipping from 1906, the fate of a cobbler from Marrakesh who was found guilty of murdering 36 women (the bodies were found buried underneath his shop and in his garden) is recounted. In order to deter others from similar heinous crimes, he was sentenced to be walled up alive. For two days after his immurement his screams were heard incessantly, but from the third day, all was silent from him.\n\nDuring the battle against Wazir Khan, Guru Gobind Singh's two elder sons died and the two younger ones, aged nine and seven, were bricked up alive in Wazir Khan's palace.\n\nIn several cultures, it is attested that living persons were entombed along with a deceased person, as part of the funerary ritual. Some such borderline cases between buried alive and immurement are included here.\n\nIn the ancient Sumerian city of Ur some graves (as early as 2500 BC.) clearly show the burial of attendants, along with that of the principal dead person. In one such grave, Gerda Lerner writes:\nIn 102 BC, the Qin Shi Huang died, and all the imperial concubines and the artisans who had worked on the mausoleum were immured alive along with him.\n\nThe 14th century traveller Ibn Batuta observed once the burial of a great khan, and writes the following, pertinent to immurement:\n\nHarold Edward Bindloss, in his 1898 non-fiction \"In the Niger country\" writes the following transpiring when a great chief died:\nWithin Inca culture, it is reported that as one element in the great Sun festival was the sacrifice of young maidens (between ten and twelve years old), who after their ceremonial duties done were lowered down in a waterless cistern and were immured alive.\n\nA particularly severe form of asceticism within Christianity is that of anchorites, who typically allowed themselves to be immured, and subsisting on minimal food. For example, in the 4th century AD, one nun named \"Alexandra immured herself in a tomb for ten years with a tiny aperture enabling her to receive meager provisions...Saint Jerome (ca.340-420) spoke of one follower who spent his entire life in a cistern, consuming no more than five figs a day\".\n\nIn Catholic monastic tradition, there existed a type of enforced, lifelong confinement against nuns or monks who had broken their vows of chastity, or espoused heretical ideas, and some have believed that this type of imprisonment was, indeed, a form of immurement. The judgment was preceded by the phrase \"vade in pacem\", that is, \"go \"into\" peace\", rather than \"go \"in\" peace\". (Latin \"in\" can be translated to English as either \"in\" or \"into\", depending on the case of its object—ablative for \"in\" or accusative for \"into\".) As Henry Charles Lea puts it, the tradition seems to have been that of complete, utter isolation from other human beings, but that food was, indeed, provided:\n\nIn the footnote appended to this passage, Lea writes:\n\nAlthough the \"Vade in Pace\" tradition therefore seems to one of perpetual, aggravated confinement, but not immurement where the individual was meant to starve to death, several have thought \"vade in pace\" was just that, a death sentence. For example, Sir Walter Scott, himself an antiquarian, notes in a remark to his poem \"Marmion\" (1808):\n\nThe practice of immuring nuns or monks on breaches of chastity has a long history, and Francesca Medioli writes the following in her essay \"Dimensions of the Cloister\":\n\nEmile Durkheim in his work \"Suicide\" writes the following about certain followers of Amida Buddha:\n\nAccording to Finnish legends, a young maiden was wrongfully immured into the castle wall of Olavinlinna as a punishment for treason. The subsequent growth of a rowan tree at the location of her execution, whose flowers were as white as her innocence and berries as red as her blood, inspired a ballad. Similar legends stem from Haapsalu, Kuressaare, Põlva and Visby.\n\nAccording to a Latvian legend as many as three people might have been immured in tunnels under the Grobiņa Castle. A daughter of a knight living in the castle did not approve of her father's choice of a young nobleman as her future husband. Said knight also pillaged surrounding areas and took prisoners to live in the tunnels, among these a handsome young man whom the daughter took a liking to, helping him escape. Her fate wasn't so lucky as the knight and his future son-in-law punished her by immuring her in one of the tunnels. Another nobleman's daughter and a Swedish soldier are also said to be immured in one of the tunnels after she had fallen in love with the Swedish soldier and requested her father to allow her to marry him. According to another legend a maiden and a servant have been immured after a failed attempt at spying on Germans wanting to know what their plans were for what is now Latvia.\n\nBy popular legend, Anarkali was immured between two walls in Lahore, Pakistan by order of Mughal Emperor Akbar for having a relationship with crown prince Salim (later Emperor Jehangir) in the 16th century. A bazaar developed around the site, and was named Anarkali Bazaar in her honour.\n\nA number of cultures have tales and ballads containing as a motif the sacrifice of a human being to ensure the strength of a building.\n\nThe folklore of many Southeastern European peoples refers to immurement as the mode of death for the victim sacrificed during the completion of a construction project, such as a bridge or fortress (mostly real buildings). The Castle of Shkodra is the subject of such stories in both the Albanian oral tradition and in the Slavic one: in the Albanian version, three brothers uselessly toiled at building walls that disappeared at night: when told that they had to bury one of their wives in the wall, they pledge to choose the one that will bring them lunch the next day, and not to warn their respective spouse. Two brothers do, however (the topos of two fellows betraying one is common in Balkan poetry, cfr. Miorița or the Song of Çelo Mezani), leave Rozafa, the wife of the honest brother, to die. She accepts her fate, but asks to leave exposed her foot (to rock the infant son's cradle), the breast (to feed him) and the hand (to stroke his hair). The Serbian version is The Building of Skadar, and differs on a few details (the name \"Rozafa\" and the topic of betrayal are absent). A very similar Romanian legend, that of Meşterul Manole, tells of the building of the Curtea de Argeş Monastery: ten expert masons, among whom Master Manole himself, are ordered by Neagu Voda to build a beautiful monastery, but incur the same fate, and decide to immure the wife who will bring them lunch. Manole, working on the roof, sees her approach, and pleads with God to unleash the elements, in order to stop her, but in vain: when she arrives, he proceeds to wall her in, pretending to be doing so in jest, with his wife increasingly crying out in pain and distress. When the building is finished, Neagu Voda takes away the masons' ladders, fearing they will build a more beautiful building, and they try to escape but all fall to their death. Only from Manole's fall a stream is created.\n\nMany other Bulgarian and Romanian folk poems and songs describe a bride offered for such purposes, and her subsequent pleas to the builders to leave her hands and breasts free, that she might still nurse her child. Later versions of the songs revise the bride's death; her fate to languish, entombed in the stones of the construction, is transmuted to her nonphysical shadow, and its loss yet leads to her pining away and eventual death.\n\nOther variations include the Hungarian folk ballad \"Kőmíves Kelemen\" (Kelemen the Stonemason). This is the story of twelve unfortunate stonemasons tasked with building the fort of Déva (a real building). To remedy its recurring collapses, it is agreed that one of the builders must sacrifice his bride, and the bride to be sacrificed will be she who first comes to visit. In some versions of the ballad the victim is shown some mercy; rather than being trapped alive she is burned and only her ashes are immured..\n\nA Greek story \"The Bridge of Arta\" () describes numerous failed attempts to build a bridge in that city. A cycle whereby a team of skilled builders toils all day only to return the next morning to find their work demolished is eventually ended when the master mason's wife is immured.\n\nLike many other European folktales, legend has it that a maiden was immured in the walls of Madliena church as a sacrifice or offering after continuous failed attempts at building it. The pastor achieved this by inviting all of the most beautiful maidens to a feast and the most beautiful one, Madaļa, falling into a deep sleep after he'd offered her wine from a \"certain goblet\".\nAcknowledging the traditions of human sacrifice in the context of the building of structures within German and Slavic folklore, Jacob Grimm proffers some examples of the sacrifice of \"animals\" as well. According to him, within Danish traditions, a lamb was immured under an erected altar in order to preserve it, while a churchyard was to be ensured protection by immuring a living horse as part of the ceremony. In the ceremonies of erection of other types of constructions, Grimm notices that other animals were sacrificed as well, such as pigs, hens and dogs.\n\nThere exist legends that the residents of Mary King's Close in Edinburgh had been immured and left to perish during an outbreak of the plague; however, this is considered to be untrue.\n\nIn several places, immured skeletons have been found in buildings and ruins. Many of these finds have been asserted, at one time or another, to be evidence of a historical practice in consonance with the tales and legends of sacrificing human beings when constructing a building, or as being the remains of persons punished by immurement, or possibly, victims of murder.\n\nIn the ruins of Thornton Abbey, Lincolnshire, an immured skeleton was found behind a wall; along with a table, book and a candlestick. By some, he is believed to be the fourteenth abbot, immured for some crime he committed.\nIn 1755, it is reported that in a castle belonging to the Duke of Dorset, the skeleton of a man was found behind the wall of a servant's room. No clothes were found, but a seal with a religious inscription was found, and the skeleton had a pair of wooden clogs on the feet. The author discusses the possibility of the person having been some sort of state prisoner immured, but opts for him being the victim of murder instead.\n\nIn 1778, when some reconstruction was done at Cesvaine Palace, a skeleton in a woman's dress was found behind a wall. Old people assured the visitor August Hupel that she had been immured alive at the building of the castle, but Hupel regarded the whole story as rather fanciful, and remained skeptical.\nIn 1770, human remains were found at the medieval castle Tiefburg in what is now a quarter of Heidelberg, then the village of Handschuhsheim. Going down a winding stair, the castle owner noticed one wall sounded hollow, and called for a mason to break it open. Inside was a niche that contained a skeleton in full armour; at the opening, it fell together. The helmet still carried traces of gilding, along with several sword strokes. It was assumed that the individual had been defeated in a feud, and had been immured alive at some remote time.\nIn the 1770s, Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, 1st Baronet toured countries like Sweden and Denmark, and wrote a memoir on his journeys. He was wholly displeased with his visit to Malmö, and said the only thing of interest was that of the skeleton of a monk who had been immured in the church wall. According to tradition, the monk had been found guilty of fornication, and had lived nine days immured, having been fed eggs though a small hole.\nIn 1686 Bremen, when a 132-year-old city gate was rebuilt, a tiny coffin containing the skeletal remains of a child was found. A century earlier, in 1589, the city walls had been reconstructed. More than 200 years later, in 1812, there was discovered embedded in the walls some 50 tiny oak coffins. These were, however, empty. At Plesse castle, close by Göttingen, a small child coffin with remains was found in the early 19th century. In 1819, when the city walls of Harburg were renewed, a whole series of child coffins were found, just as in the walls of Bremen. The coffins in Harburg, however, did contain skeletal remains.

They were given some time to recant their faith, but chose instead to give their worldly goods to the poor and retire to a mountain cave to pray, where they fell asleep. The emperor, seeing that their attitude towards paganism had not improved, ordered the mouth of the cave to be sealed. Others amongst many involve various tales in Christianity and Islam utilizing various cave sites.\nFor alleged treachery, Ugolino della Gherardesca and his sons and grandsons were immured in the Torre dei Gualandi in the thirteenth century.

The stanza XXV reads:\n\nScott, himself an antiquarian, believed that the Catholic Church in earlier times immured monks and nuns found guilty of breaking their vows of chastity, explains his belief in a note appended to the poem. \nThis form of death appears in several of Edgar Allan Poe's works, including \"The Cask of Amontillado\". Montresor, the narrator, immures his enemy, Fortunato, within the catacombs beyond the wine cellar under his palazzo.

As the youngest surviving daughter of Philip II of Spain and Elisabeth of Valois, she was the sister of Isabella Clara Eugenia, Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands.\n\nCatherine Michelle was described as beautiful, intelligent, arrogant and well aware of her high social status. She had a good relationship with her father and exchanged letters with him after her marriage. Charles Emmanuel I suggested the marriage as a way of gaining Spanish support for his plans to expand Savoy on the coast of the then weakened France. The wedding took place in Zaragoza on 11 March 1585 and the couple made their entrance to Turin in Savoy 10 August 1585.\n\nCatherine Michelle was initially unpopular because of her arrogance and attempts to introduce Spanish pomp, ceremony and way of dress to the Court in Turin. However, she soon gained respect because of her political and diplomatic skill, which she used to defend the autonomy of Savoy against Spain. She refused the Spanish offer to install a Spanish garrison in Turin from Milan with the excuse of giving her a life guard. She is reported to have had great influence on Charles Emmanuel I and to have reformed him for the better. She also served as regent several times during the absence of the duke on military campaigns, such as during the Lyon campaign in 1594. Catherine Michelle also benefited cultural life in Savoy, founded many new buildings including an art gallery and invited several artists such as Torquato Tasso, Chiabrera, Marini, Tassoni and Botero.\n\nCatherine Michelle died near the end of 1597; she had miscarried earlier that year.

Her name in Italian means a gemstone or jewel.\n\nThe \"Perla\"-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding . The modifications that were made compared to the boats of the previous series were mostly of upgrade nature. Among them were enlargement of the false tower at the top, more modern engines, installation of a radiogoniometer that could be controlled from inside the ship. Improvements and the installation of new air conditioning equipment meant a slight increase in displacement, and increase in the fuel stowage also increased the autonomy of these boats compared to the previous series. Their designed full load displacement was surfaced and submerged, but varied somewhat depending on the boat and the builder. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of to .\n\nFor surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft with overall power of . When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the \"Perla\" class had a range of at , submerged, they had a range of at .\n\nThe boats were armed with six internal torpedo tubes, four in the bow and two in the stern. One reload torpedo was carried for each tube, for a total of twelve. They were also armed with one deck gun for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of machine guns.\n\n\"Gemma\" was built by CRDA at their shipyard in Monfalcone, laid on 7 September 1935, launched on 21 May 1936 and completed on 8 July 1936.\n\nAfter delivery, \"Gemma\" was assigned to the 35th Squadron (III Submarine group) based at Messina. After a brief training, she carried out a long endurance cruise in the Dodecanese in the fall of 1936. She repeated the same endurance cruise in the Dodecanese in 1937.\n\nFrom August 27 through September 5, 1937 \"Gemma\", under command of captain Carlo Ferracuti, carried out a secret mission in the Strait of Sicily during the Spanish Civil War. She made three attempts to attack during this mission, but no actual attacks happened due to impossibility to identify the targets with certainty. Upon completion she returned to Augusta.\n\nIn 1938, \"Gemma\" together with were assigned to the Red Sea base of Massawa in Eritrea. In the spring of 1939 \"Gemma\" and performed a cruise in the Indian Ocean to test the performance of the class in terms of sailing and operational capability in warm seas and during the monsoon season. The results were disappointing: it was discovered that stormy sea prevented the use of submarine's armament and made it very difficult even to remain at a periscope depth. There were also reports of malfunctioning air conditioning system, and leaks of chloromethane were reported. In the fall of 1939 she came back to the Mediterranean and was assigned to the 14th Submarine Squadron (I Submarine group) based at La Spezia. In 1940 \"Gemma\" was reassigned to the 13th Submarine Squadron (I Submarine Group), but was operating from Leros.\n\nAfter Italy's entrance into World War II, \"Gemma\", under command of Guido Lanza Cordero di Montezemolo, was sent to patrol off Chios. She returned to her base on June 15 without encountering any traffic.\n\nFrom June 30 through July 8, 1940 \"Gemma\" patrolled off Sollum, and returned to her base without sighting any enemy ships.\n\nFrom August 7 through August 16, 1940 she patrolled off Crete, but again without any success.\n\nOn September 30, 1940, \"Gemma\" sailed to her area of operation, located in the northern section of the Strait of Kasos, just east of Crete. was deployed to the south of \"Gemma\", in the center of the Strait of Kasos, and further south, another submarine, under command of captain Alberto Avogadro di Cerrione, was deployed. \"Gemma\" arrived in the area on October 1 and was supposed to remain on station until October 8, but in the evening of October 3 she was ordered to patrol further east in the strait between Rhodes and Karpathos. On October 6, a new order was sent to \"Gemma\" telling her to return to the base, but due to a mix-up the message was never received by \"Gemma\" and she remained on her station. On October 7, \"Tricheco\" had a sick crew on board and had to return to Leros. On her return voyage she had to pass near the eastern coast of Karpathos, thus crossing an area where \"Gemma\" was stationed. Due to a mix-up and delay in communication, \"Tricheco\" was unaware of \"Gemma\"'s location.\n\nAt 1:15 on Oct. 8, \"Tricheco\" sighted in the dark a silhouette of a submarine on the surface. Since it was impossible to recognize the nationality of a submarine at night, it was a normal practice to consider all unknown submarines enemies, unless a presence of a submarine was communicated to the captain. At 1:21 \"Tricheco\" launched two torpedoes from a short distance against an \"enemy\" ship. \"Gemma\" was hit by both torpedoes right in the middle and immediately sank with the entire crew in the position just off the coast of Karpathos.\nCaptain Cordero di Montezemolo, four other officers, and 39 other crew members went down with the boat.\n\nInitially the disappearance of \"Gemma\" was attributed to British anti-submarine activity, as the October 8th radio news reported the loss of two enemy submarines with several survivors captured which gave families some hope. However, soon the coincidence between \"Tricheco\"'s attack and the disappearance of \"Gemma\" became all too obvious. \"Gemma\" was declared as lost, and her crew was declared dead, rather than missing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1012486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1012486", "title": "Jack Sheridan (umpire)", "text": "Jack Sheridan (umpire)\n\nJohn F. Sheridan (1862 – November 2, 1914) was an American umpire in Major League Baseball. In his 30-year career as an official, he worked 18 seasons between 1890 and 1914 in three major leagues. Several of Sheridan's contemporaries considered him to be the best major league umpire. He pioneered the crouching stance used by modern umpires at home plate. In 1945, Sheridan was named to the Roll of Honor of the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nSheridan was born in Decatur, Illinois. His mother Bridget was born in Ireland. During his childhood, Jack's family moved to San Jose, California, where he made his home thereafter. He enjoyed a brief career in the minor leagues as a second baseman. In 1883, Sheridan secured an advance of funds by convincing the manager of a Chattanooga minor league team that he would be an asset to the team. The manager was so disappointed in Sheridan's abilities that he took out an arrest warrant on the player. Sheridan was forced to repay the money he earned by working at a cigarette factory. He turned to umpiring soon after traveling with a team of California players for an eastern tour.\n\nHe began his career by umpiring in the Southern League in 1885, then officiated in the California League from 1886–89, after which he gained his first major league experience in the sole season of the Players' League in 1890. Nearly all games in that era used a single umpire, and the most outstanding officials generally moved from league to league, going wherever the league presidents were perceived as being most supportive, both in salary and in affirming the umpires' field authority. After returning to the California League for the 1891 season, Sheridan umpired in the National League in 1892, then again in the Southern League in 1893.\n\nIn 1894-95, he umpired in the Western League, where he first became associated with that league's president, Ban Johnson. Johnson was fiercely supportive of his umpiring staff, and apart from a brief return to the NL in 1896-97, Sheridan would remain an umpire in Johnson's league for the remainder of his career. In 1901, the Western League added several eastern cities and renamed itself the American League, and through a series of signings of NL players successfully established itself as a rival major league. In contrast to the rowdier NL, where umpires were routinely subjected to great abuse with little backing from the league office, Johnson staunchly defended his field officials and insisted that players and local authorities maintain respect for them.\n\nWhen he was not umpiring, Sheridan worked as an undertaker. A 1905 newspaper article even described Sheridan as having announced his retirement to pursue undertaking in 1905. Before the 1906 season, Sheridan renewed his contract with the American League. In 1906, Sheridan ejected outfielder Tip O'Neill after an argument and may have been indirectly responsible for the end of O'Neill's career. The outfielder was replaced by Pat Dougherty, who won the position for the season. O'Neill did not play in the major leagues after that year.\n\nHe became the standard after which other umpires patterned themselves; after arriving in the AL at age 22 in 1906, Billy Evans regularly worked in a team with Sheridan for several years in order to study under the senior umpire, with Sheridan usually working behind the plate and Evans on the bases. Both Evans and fellow Hall of Famer Bill Klem regarded Sheridan as the game's greatest umpire. Many years later, Evans said, \"Each day while working the bases I would follow every move of Sheridan, as he shifted his body and stance back of the plate to follow the flight of the ball.\"\nSheridan umpired in four of the first seven World Series: 1905, 1907, 1908 and 1910; he also umpired in the earlier Temple Cup NL championship series in 1896. In the winter of 1913–1914, he and Klem were the two umpires accompanying the Chicago White Sox and New York Giants on their world tour. Along with Bob Emslie and Tim Hurst, he is one of only three umpires who umpired both before 1893, when the pitching distance was only 50 feet, and also after the NL and AL formally recognized one another as major leagues in 1903. He is the only umpire active prior to 1893 who went on to officiate in a World Series.\n\nIn September 1911, Sheridan asked Johnson for permission to permanently retire from umpiring. Johnson presented Sheridan with a medal of appreciation and said that while Sheridan would retire from the field, he expected the umpire to return to the league in an off-the-field capacity the next season. In March 1912, Sheridan said, \"But I guess when the bell rings I'll be back in harness. Ban Johnson will need me when the fight grows hot.\" He umpired between June and August of that season. \"The Pittsburgh Press\" announced that Sheridan would retire before the 1913 season. He joined the umpiring staff in late June that year.\n\nHe suffered sunstroke while umpiring a game at Chicago in August 1914, and never fully recovered from the affliction. He called his last game on September 24 at Chicago, and despite the pleas of fellow officials insisted on remaining in the city for the crosstown series between the White Sox and Cubs before traveling to his home in California. Once there, his condition continued to deteriorate until he died three weeks later at age 52, at the San Jose home of his sister.\n\nThe day after Sheridan died, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote that he was \"the most famous and oldest diamond official before the public and was popular because of his well-known honesty and ability.\"\n\nOver his 14 seasons as the dean of AL umpires, Sheridan became the prototype of the 20th century umpire. Whereas umpires in the 19th century had worked behind the plate in a standing position, believing that it helped them to better observe the flight of the ball, Sheridan established the practice of crouching while calling balls and strikes, a move which was quickly adopted universally due to its effectiveness. He was also remarkable in that he refused to use any sort of protection other than a mask. He was agile enough to reportedly never be hit by a foul ball.\n\nSheridan was among the several umpires who were named to a Roll of Honor by the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946, at a time when no umpires had yet received full membership in the Hall. In the initial voting for induction of umpires in 1953, he finished third in the voting behind inductees Bill Klem and Tommy Connolly, and was the only other candidate to receive a first-place vote.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "324406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324406", "title": "Jane Stanford", "text": "Jane Stanford\n\nJane Elizabeth Lathrop Stanford (August 25, 1828 – February 28, 1905) was a co-founder of Stanford University in 1885 (opened 1891) along with her husband, Leland Stanford, as a memorial to their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who died in 1884 at the age of 15. After her husband's death in 1893, she funded and operated the university almost single-handedly until her mysterious death in 1905.\n\nBorn Jane Elizabeth Lathrop in Albany, New York, she was the daughter of shopkeeper Dyer Lathrop and Jane Anne (Shields) Lathrop. She attended The Albany Academy for Girls, the longest running girls' day school in the country. She married Leland Stanford on September 30, 1850, and went to live with him in Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he had practiced law since 1848.\n\nThe Stanfords lived in Port Washington until 1852 when his law library and other property were lost to fire; they then returned to Albany. Leland Stanford went to California to join his brothers in mercantile businesses related to the California Gold Rush, while Jane remained in Albany with her family. He returned in 1855, and the following year they moved to San Francisco, where he engaged in mercantile pursuits on a large scale. Stanford was a cofounder of the Central Pacific Railroad, serving as its president from 1861 until his death in 1893. He was also president of the Southern Pacific Railroad from 1868 until ousted from the post by Collis Potter Huntington in 1890. Stanford also served as Governor of California from 1862 to 1863, and one of California's United States senators from 1885 until his death in 1893. After nearly 18 years of marriage, they finally had a child, a son, in 1868 when Jane Stanford was 39.\n\nAfter the death of their only child Leland Stanford, Jr., in 1884 while on a trip in Italy, the elder Leland turned to his wife and said \"The children of California shall be our children.\" They then founded Leland Stanford Junior University in their son's honor. The university opened in 1891. After Leland's death on June 21, 1893, Jane in effect took control of the university. The university suffered severe financial hardship because of Leland's death, and the trustees advocated a temporary closure of the university until tax and legal issues could be resolved, but she insisted it remain in operation. Until the estate left probate in 1898 she paid for the university out of her personal resources (as the widow she was allowed $10,000/month while the estate was in probate and she also attempted to sell her personal jewels). As the remaining founder she wielded a great deal of legal control over the university until her death though she allowed the Board of Trustees greater authority after June 1, 1903.\n\nIt was at her direction that Stanford University gained an early focus on the arts. She also advocated the admission of women; the university had been coeducational since its founding. She figured prominently in the issue of academic freedom when she sought and ultimately succeeded in having Stanford University economist Edward A. Ross fired for making speeches favoring Democrat William Jennings Bryan and favoring racism against Chinese American \"coolies\", outlining eugenics policies directed against Chinese people and other racial groups, and for his collectivist economic teachings. This case resulted in the American Association of University Professors' \"Report on Academic Freedom and Tenure\" of 1915, by Arthur Oncken Lovejoy and Edwin R. A. Seligman, and in the AAUP 1915 Declaration of Principles.\n\nShe traveled to London during 1897, the year of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, hoping to find a buyer for her rubies and other jewels to raise funds for the university; however, she was not able to sell them at that time. In 1905 she directed the university trustees that after her death, her jewels should be sold and the funds used as a permanent endowment \"...to be used exclusively for the purchase of books and other publications.\" The board of trustees confirmed this arrangement, and the Jewel Fund continues to add to the university's library collections. The endowment, originally $500,000, is now worth about $20 million. Items purchased through the Jewel Fund display a distinctive bookplate that depicts a romanticized Jane Stanford offering her jewels to Athena, the goddess of wisdom. Since 2007, benefactors who provide endowments for library acquisitions are referred to as members of the Jewel Society.\n\nIn 1905, Jane Stanford was at the center of one of America's legendary murder mysteries. She died of strychnine poisoning while on the island of Oahu, in a room at the Moana Hotel.\n\nOn January 14, 1905, at her Nob Hill mansion in San Francisco, Stanford consumed mineral water that tasted bitter. She quickly forced herself to vomit the water (with prompting from and assistance by her maid) and, when both the maid and her secretary agreed that the bottled water tasted strange, sent it to a pharmacy to be analyzed. The findings, returned a few weeks later, showed that the water had been poisoned with a lethal dose of strychnine. Stanford moved out of her mansion, vowing never to return. Elizabeth Richmond, the maid, fell under suspicion (she had previously worked in Britain and had reportedly regaled Stanford's domestic staff with tales of English aristocrats being poisoned by their servants) and was dismissed. The Harry Morse Detective and Patrol Agency was retained to discreetly investigate the incident. Its detectives put Richmond under surveillance and scoured records of Bay Area pharmacies for possibly suspicious purchases of strychnine, finding none. While the agency learned that the mansion was a hothouse of petty staff jealousies, graft, and intrigue, they were unable to come up with evidence pointing to a culprit or a motive for an attempted murder. Depressed by the conviction that an unknown party had tried to kill her, and suffering from a cold, Stanford shortly thereafter decided to sail to Hawaii, with plans to continue on to Japan. The Stanford party left San Francisco for Honolulu on February 15, 1905.\n\nAt the Moana Hotel on the evening of February 28, Stanford asked for bicarbonate of soda to settle her stomach. Her personal secretary, Bertha Berner (a trusted employee of twenty years' standing and the only other person present who had also been at the scene of the previous incident), prepared the solution, which Stanford drank. At 11:15 p.m., Stanford cried out for her servants and hotel staff to call for a physician, declaring that she had lost control of her body and believed she had been poisoned again. This time, attempts to induce vomiting were unsuccessful. Robert Cutler, a retired Stanford neurologist, recounted in \"The Mysterious Death of Jane Stanford\" what took place upon the arrival of Francis Howard Humphris, the hotel physician:\n\nAs Humphris tried to administer a solution of bromine and chloral hydrate, Mrs. Stanford, now in anguish, exclaimed, 'My jaws are stiff. This is a horrible death to die.' Whereupon she was seized by a tetanic spasm that progressed relentlessly to a state of severe rigidity: her jaws clamped shut, her thighs opened widely, her feet twisted inwards, her fingers and thumbs clenched into tight fists, and her head drew back. Finally, her respiration ceased. Stanford was dead from strychnine poisoning.\n\nThe \"San Francisco Evening Bulletin\" trumpeted the news with a March 1 headline, \"Mrs. Stanford Dies, Poisoned.\" Forensic chemical analysis revealed the presence of a pure form of strychnine in samples from the bicarbonate she had taken, as well as traces of the poison in her tissues. After hearing three days of testimony, the coroner's jury concluded in less than two minutes that she had died of strychnine \"introduced into a bottle of bicarbonate of soda with felonious intent by some person or persons to this jury unknown.\" The testimony revealed that the bottle in question had been purchased in California (after Richmond was let go), had been accessible to anyone in Stanford's residence during the period when her party was packing, and had not been used until the night of her death.\n\nThe jury's quick verdict was to prove controversial. A dispatch in \"The New York Times\" of March 11, 1905, stated that the verdict was \"written out with the knowledge and assistance of Deputy High Sheriff Rawlins,\" implying that the jurors may have been coached on what conclusion to reach. This controversy was largely stoked by Stanford University President David Starr Jordan. Jordan had sailed to Hawaii himself and hired a local doctor, Ernest Coniston Waterhouse, to dispute poisoning as the cause of death. He subsequently reported to the press that Stanford had in fact died of heart failure, a \"medically preposterous\" diagnosis given the dramatic and highly distinctive symptoms of strychnine poisoning she had displayed. In his book, Cutler concludes that \"There is ample evidence that Mrs. Stanford was poisoned, that she was given good care, and that Jordan went over there to hush it up.\" Stanford had long had a difficult relationship with Jordan; at the time of her death, she was president of the university's board of trustees and was reportedly planning to remove him from his position.\n\nJordan's motives for involvement in the case are uncertain; however, he had written the new president of Stanford's board of trustees offering several alternate explanations for Jane Stanford's death, suggesting they select whichever would be most suitable. The university leadership may have believed that avoiding the appearance of scandal was of overriding importance. The coverup evidently succeeded to the extent that the likelihood that she was murdered was largely overlooked by historians and commentators until the 1980s.\n\nThe source of the strychnine was never identified. Stanford was buried alongside her husband Leland and their son at the Stanford family mausoleum on the Stanford campus.\n\nJane Lathrop Stanford Middle School in the Palo Alto Unified School District was named after her in 1985. The town of Lathrop, California in San Joaquin County was developed by her husband's railroad company in the late 1860s and named after Jane and her brother Charles Lathrop.\n\n"}

Perkins was an iconic figure in what would become known as rockabilly music. His creatively simple, sparsely embellished, rhythmic use of Fender Esquire, Jazzmaster and Jaguar guitars is credited for creating Cash's signature \"boom-chicka-boom\" style.\n\nPerkins was born in Como, Mississippi, the son of a Baptist preacher. He grew up in Como, Mississippi, and taught himself to play rhythm guitar.\n\nPerkins started his career in 1953 as a mechanic at Automobile Sales Company in Memphis. He specialized in electrical systems and radio repairs. Roy Cash, Sr., older brother of Johnny Cash, was service manager at the dealership. At the time, the younger Cash was stationed in Germany with the US Air Force. At Automobile Sales, Perkins met co-workers Marshall Grant and A.W. 'Red' Kernodle. Grant, Kernodle and Perkins began bringing their guitars to work, and would play together when repair business was slow.\n\nWhen Johnny Cash moved to Memphis after returning from Germany in 1954, Roy Cash introduced him to Grant, Kernodle and Perkins. The four began to get together in the evenings at Perkins' or Grant's home and play songs. It was during this time that they decided to form a band, with Grant acquiring a string bass, Kernodle a six-string steel guitar, and Perkins buying a somewhat-abused Fender Esquire electric guitar from the O.K. Houck Piano Co. in Memphis. The guitar had been modified by a previous owner, and the volume and tone controls did not work.\n\nSince he could not control the volume of the single-pickup instrument, Perkins began the practice of muting the three bass strings (E, A and D) with the heel of his right hand, much in the style of Merle Travis, and scratching a rhythm pattern (as heard on Sun Records recordings prior to 1958). This pattern developed into a more defined, varying 1/8-8/5/8-8 picking (with random syncopation) on later Sun recordings and for the rest of Perkins’ career.\n\nIn late 1954, when Cash got an audition with producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records, he brought Perkins, Grant and Kernodle along to back him instrumentally. The experience made Kernodle nervous, and he ended up leaving before the session was over, with Perkins and Grant providing the instrumentation.\n\nPerkins, as a member of the Tennessee Two (later, the Tennessee Three, with the addition of drummer W.S. \"Fluke\" Holland), toured with Cash and appeared on most of his recordings. He was well known for his laconic, focused demeanor on stage. He was often the target of jokes by Cash, who would make comments such as \"Luther's been dead for years, but he just doesn't know it\".\n\nPerkins was Cash's lead guitarist on many of the popular Town Hall Party television appearances in the 1950s, often interacting with one another for stage effect and providing the signature \"boom-chick-a-boom\" background sound that came to define a large part of Johnny Cash's sound. \n\nPerkins was married twice. He and his first wife, Bertie, separated while they were living in southern California in 1959. Perkins had three daughters: Linda, Vickie, and Claudia. He later married Margie Higgins; Margie Higgins' niece Kathy lived with them. Margie Perkins Beaver still appears at Johnny Cash reunion events.\n\nHis hobbies were knitting, fishing and guitar.\n\nHe was a close friend of singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson. At the time of his death, he was planning to open his own music publishing company and give Kristofferson his first break.\n\nPerkins’ younger brother, Thomas, was a successful rock ‘n’ roll singer in the 1950s and 1960s, under the name of Thomas Wayne.\n\nIn his autobiography, Johnny Cash wrote that Perkins was mildly addicted to amphetamines. They started taking drugs together in the late 1950s.\n\nPerkins' nickname was \"L.M\", the initials of his first and second name \"Luther Monroe\". Singer-guitarist Carl Perkins, who was also a member of Cash's touring show, was not related to Luther Perkins.\n\nDuring the early morning hours of August 3, 1968, Perkins returned from fishing on Old Hickory Lake to his newly constructed home on Riverwood Drive in Hendersonville, Tennessee. He apparently went to sleep in the living room while holding a lit cigarette. His niece by marriage awoke around 6:00 am to find the living room in flames and Perkins collapsed near the door. An emergency crew rushed Perkins to Vanderbilt University Hospital, where he was kept in intensive care until he died on August 5, 1968.\n\nHis grave is near the graves of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash at Hendersonville Memorial Park in Hendersonville, Tennessee.\n\nLuther Perkins was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Perkins is #0230.\n\nIn 1980, Perkins's daughters from his first marriage filed suit against Johnny Cash for embezzling funds that were to have provided retirement income for Perkins. This lawsuit was filed coincidentally with actions taken by the other founding Tennessee Three member, Marshall Grant, against Cash for wrongfully firing Grant and embezzlement of Grant's retirement funds. Both lawsuits were eventually settled out-of-court.\n\nIn \"Walk The Line\", the 2005 biopic of Johnny Cash, Perkins is portrayed by Dan John Miller. Perkins's future death is alluded to in the film in a bus scene where Cash (played by Joaquin Phoenix) walks past a sleeping Perkins. Perkins is depicted as asleep with his cigarette still burning in his mouth. Cash stubs it out in the ashtray in front of him which foreshadows Perkins's eventual death.\n\n"}

Today’s maternity housing programs support a woman in need of a stable home environment to reach her goals in a variety of areas, not just pregnancy. In the past, many maternity homes had jailhouse aspects and forcibly institutionalized lower-class \"fallen\" unwed pregnant women. \nMaternity homes are not to be confused with maternity hospitals, or other facilities where women give birth. Another sort of temporary housing for pregnant women are the maternity hostels which have become widespread in countries such as India where commercial surrogacy is big business. \n\nMaternity homes used to be known as homes for unwed mothers, as illegitimacy was (and in some places still is) a social taboo.\n\nThe Salvation Army opened its first one in 1886. Other examples include Bethany Home in Minneapolis, later renamed Harriet Walker Hospital. \n\nPrior to the 1980s, housing for pregnant women was offered in larger, institution-like settings that were strongly adoption-oriented. In these homes, confidentiality was a priority due to the social stigma around unwed births and the policies reflected the adoption laws and practices of the time. It is from these settings that many of the misconceptions around maternity homes that continue to this day grew (e.g. forcing women into adoption, not allowing adoptive mothers to see their child, not providing any information about placement.)  \n\nIn the 1970s and 80s, the adoption process began to grow in flexibility (e.g. changes to father notification, no longer making short term placements of adopted babies into foster care, making use of probate court adoptions rather than solely via adoption agencies, increased inter-state adoptions.)  Offering a more flexible housing option via a new model paralleled the more flexible adoption process.  The large, institutional maternity homes began to close during this time.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Anne and Jim Pierson were pioneers in the host home model and publicly recognized by President Reagan for their family-style method of welcoming pregnant women.  Shepherding or host homes grew in popularity in the 1980s and 1990s as a new type of housing resource.  In this model, pregnant women in crisis pregnancies were housed within the spare bedrooms in the homes of passionate volunteers during their pregnancy. Several long-standing maternity homes used some version of a host home living environment as the launching point for developing a housing program.  Additionally, many founders of long-standing maternity homes (and other pregnancy help organizations) began by welcoming women into their own home.\n\nSome maternity homes, such as the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, were found to have provided highly substandard care.  \n\nThe American Red Cross sponsored maternity hostels in London after World War I.\n\n"}

It was the first family film to be released by DreamWorks Pictures.\n\nIn the story, two Laurel and Hardy-like brothers struggle against one small house mouse for possession of a house that was willed to them by their father. The intelligent and crafty mouse outwits them completely. The film is set in a humorously indeterminate 20th-century time period, with styles ranging from the 1940s to the 1990s.\n\nWhen once-wealthy string magnate Rudolf Smuntz (William Hickey) dies, he leaves his outdated string factory and a run-down mansion to his two sons, Lars (Lee Evans) and Ernie (Nathan Lane). When Lars refuses a proposal by representatives from the large Zeppco conglomerate to purchase their string factory due to a promise he made to his father, his self-centered, money-hungry wife April (Vicki Lewis) throws him out. Meanwhile, Ernie serves Mayor McKrinkle (Cliff Emmich) at his restaurant in anticipation of becoming a famous chef for serving such a high-profile guest. However, the mayor is poisoned by a cockroach (which came from Rudolf's old box of Cuban cigars that Ernie took for himself) and suffers two heart attacks, with the latter fatal. As a result, Ernie's restaurant is closed down by the Board of Health. The despondent brothers encounter each other and find solace in their father's mansion.\n\nFinding the mansion's blueprints, Ernie and Lars discover that it is a lost masterpiece designed by famous architect Charles Lyle LaRue, and could sell for a colossal fortune if properly restored. Multi-millionaire LaRue collector Alexander Falko (Maury Chaykin) makes a proposal, but Ernie refuses under the belief he and Lars can make a larger profit via auction. However, the brothers have already realized that the house has one stubborn occupant: a tiny and treacherous mouse. Lars is initially dismissive of the mouse but Ernie, fearing a repeat of the cockroach incident, is determined to rid the house of any vermin that could potentially ruin their plan.\n\nWhen a single mousetrap proves to be useless against the mouse; Ernie and Lars try all sorts of tactics to kill the rodent, each of which fail spectacularly and damage the house even more. To make matters worse; the brothers are served with a repossession notice by the bank, which warns them that the house will face foreclosure unless they make an overdue mortgage payment of $1,200 within two days, which Ernie had borrowed against to purchase a jacuzzi tub, initially in the hope of raising the property value. They initially attempt to raise the money by withholding the pay of the workers at the factory, but this suggestion triggers an angry response from the workers who then go on strike. In desperation, Lars tries to run the factory on his own but ends up losing his clothes after accidentally feeding loose threads from each article of clothing into the machinery while damaging the machine's fuse box. He is then unexpectedly reunited with April, who has learned of the auction and the brothers' plans to get rich.\n\nThe brothers purchase a monstrous cat named \"Catzilla\" to deal with the mouse. Catzilla chases the mouse throughout the house while destroying everything, but gets tricked onto the house's dumbwaiter as the mouse sends him down to his demise. They then hire an eccentric exterminator, Caesar (Christopher Walken), to handle the mouse; though he is severely injured after the mouse attaches him to the winch of his own truck which then violently drags him out of the house and destroys the floorboards and plumbing. Meanwhile, Ernie goes behind Lars' back and tries to revive the deal to sell the factory to Zeppco, but his meeting with them is thwarted when he is hit by a bus while trying to impress two attractive Belgian hair models, named Ingrid and Hilde. As Ernie is taken into hospital, Lars arrives and informs him that April has given them the $1,200 to pay off the mortgage.\n\nAfter getting back to the house and witnessing the damage caused by Catzilla and Caesar, the brothers resume their task to get rid of the mouse. Ernie chases the mouse up a chimney and gets stuck; and Lars attempts to light a match while the mouse starts a gas leak, creating a violent explosion that blasts Ernie out of the chimney, while Lars is blasted into a china cabinet. Driven to the brink of insanity; Ernie takes a shotgun to shoot the mouse, only to accidentally shoot a compressed can of pesticide that Caesar dropped, igniting it and blowing a huge hole in the floor. The brothers then get into an argument after an answerphone message from Zeppco reveals Lars turning down their offer without telling Ernie, and Ernie attempting to sell the factory in secret, which results in Zeppco's proposal being withdrawn; which culminates with Lars throwing an orange at Ernie which accidentally knocks the mouse unconscious. Unable to finish him off, they instead seal the mouse in a box and mail him to Fidel Castro in Cuba. The brothers quickly reconcile and finish renovating the house.\n\nWhen the night of the auction arrives, Falko tries to get Ernie to call off the auction with a $10 million offer, but Ernie again refuses, and the auction soon begins. Meanwhile, Lars discovers the mouse's box in the snow returned due to insufficient postage (as he and Ernie forgot to weigh the package) and with a big hole gnawed through it. Lars and Ernie panic upon seeing the mouse return, but attempt to maintain their composure as the auction continues. The mouse also devours Rudolf's \"lucky string,\" which he gave to the brothers before his death, making their vendetta even more personal. The brothers desperately attempt to flush out the mouse by feeding a garden hose into the wall. As the auction reaches a record $25 million bid, the house rapidly floods through the walls and the floors, causing everyone present to be washed out of the house as it collapses. The bidders leave, and April leaves Lars for good for a particularly rich bidder. The brothers' only consolation is the fact that the mouse must finally be dead as their father's \"lucky string\" is found in the wreckage, only to be quickly disappointed as they accidentally pull it in half.\n\nWith nowhere else to go, the brothers return to the factory and fall asleep, with only a single chunk of cheese for food. Having survived his apparent death and followed them on the underside of the car, the mouse restarts and feeds the cheese into the machinery inventing the world's first string cheese, which inspires Ernie and Lars. Ernie and Lars end their war with the mouse and have successfully rebuilt the factory as a novelty string cheese company. Lars has begun a relationship with one of the Belgian hair models, Hilde, and Ernie puts his culinary skill to work in developing new cheese flavors with the mouse as his personal taste tester.\n\nThe film ends with the \"lucky string\" being shown placed in a wall next to Rudolf's portrait with a inscription of his motto: \"A world without string is chaos.\"\n\n\n\"Mouse Hunt\" received mixed reviews from film critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 42% of 31 critics had given the film a positive review. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars, calling it \"not very funny, and maybe couldn't have been very funny no matter what, because the pieces for comedy are not in place... A comedy that hasn't assigned sympathy to some characters and made others hateful cannot expect to get many laughs, because the audience doesn't know who to laugh at, or with.\"\n\nRegarding the digital special effects, Ebert deemed the film \"an excellent example of the way modern advances in special effects can sabotage a picture (\"Titanic\" is an example of effects being used wisely). Because it is possible to make a movie in which the mouse can do all sorts of clever things, the filmmakers have assumed incorrectly that it would be funny to see the mouse doing them.\"\n\nNonetheless, the film was a financial success. It was released on December 19, 1997, and opened up in North America at #4 and grossed $6,062,922 in its opening weekend, averaging about $2,817 from 2,152 theaters. In its second weekend, it stayed at #4 and increased by 60 percent, making $9,702,770, averaging about $4,428 from 2,191 theaters, and bringing its ten day gross to $21,505,569. It closed on July 1, 1998, with a final gross of $61,917,389 in the North American market and $60,500,000 in other territories for a worldwide total of $122,417,389. Its budget was $38 million. The film was released in the United Kingdom on April 3, 1998, and opened on #2, behind \"Titanic\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3712924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3712924", "title": "Neural network software", "text": "Neural network software\n\nNeural network software is used to simulate, research, develop, and apply artificial neural networks, software concepts adapted from biological neural networks, and in some cases, a wider array of adaptive systems such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nNeural network simulators are software applications that are used to simulate the behavior of artificial or biological neural networks. They focus on one or a limited number of specific types of neural networks. They are typically stand-alone and not intended to produce general neural networks that can be integrated in other software. Simulators usually have some form of built-in visualization to monitor the training process. Some simulators also visualize the physical structure of the neural network.\n\nHistorically, the most common type of neural network software was intended for researching neural network structures and algorithms. The primary purpose of this type of software is, through simulation, to gain a better understanding of the behavior and the properties of neural networks. Today in the study of artificial neural networks, simulators have largely been replaced by more general component based development environments as research platforms.\n\nCommonly used artificial neural network simulators include the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS), Emergent and Neural Lab.\n\nIn the study of biological neural networks however, simulation software is still the only available approach. In such simulators the physical biological and chemical properties of neural tissue, as well as the electromagnetic impulses between the neurons are studied.\n\nCommonly used biological network simulators include Neuron, GENESIS, NEST and Brian.\n\nUnlike the research simulators, data analysis simulators are intended for practical applications of artificial neural networks. Their primary focus is on data mining and forecasting. Data analysis simulators usually have some form of preprocessing capabilities. Unlike the more general development environments data analysis simulators use a relatively simple static neural network that can be configured. A majority of the data analysis simulators on the market use backpropagating networks or self-organizing maps as their core. The advantage of this type of software is that it is relatively easy to use. Neural Designer is one example of a data analysis simulator.\n\nWhen the Parallel Distributed Processing volumes\n\nIn 1997, the tLearn software was released to accompany a book. This was a return to the idea of providing a small, user-friendly, simulator that was designed with the novice in mind. tLearn allowed basic feed forward networks, along with simple recurrent networks, both of which can be trained by the simple back propagation algorithm. tLearn has not been updated since 1999.\n\nIn 2011, the Basic Prop simulator was released. Basic Prop is a self-contained application, distributed as a platform neutral JAR file, that provides much of the same simple functionality as tLearn.\n\nIn 2012, Wintempla included a namespace called NN with a set of C++ classes to implement: feed forward networks, probabilistic neural networks and Kohonen networks. Neural Lab is based on Wintempla classes. Neural Lab tutorial and Wintempla tutorial explains some of these clases for neural networks. The main disadvantage of Wintempla is that it compiles only with Microsoft Visual Studio.\n\nDevelopment environments for neural networks differ from the software described above primarily on two accounts – they can be used to develop custom types of neural networks and they support deployment of the neural network outside the environment. In some cases they have advanced preprocessing, analysis and visualization capabilities.\n\nA more modern type of development environments that are currently favored in both industrial and scientific use are based on a component based paradigm. The neural network is constructed by connecting adaptive filter components in a pipe filter flow. This allows for greater flexibility as custom networks can be built as well as custom components used by the network. In many cases this allows a combination of adaptive and non-adaptive components to work together. The data flow is controlled by a control system which is exchangeable as well as the adaptation algorithms. The other important feature is deployment capabilities.\n\nWith the advent of component-based frameworks such as .NET and Java, component based development environments are capable of deploying the developed neural network to these frameworks as inheritable components. In addition some software can also deploy these components to several platforms, such as embedded systems.\n\nComponent based development environments include: Peltarion Synapse, NeuroDimension NeuroSolutions, Scientific Software Neuro Laboratory, and the LIONsolver integrated software. Free open source component based environments include Encog and Neuroph.\n\nA disadvantage of component-based development environments is that they are more complex than simulators. They require more learning to fully operate and are more complicated to develop.\n\nThe majority implementations of neural networks available are however custom implementations in various programming languages and on various platforms. Basic types of neural networks are simple to implement directly. There are also many programming libraries that contain neural network functionality and that can be used in custom implementations (such as tensorflow, theano, etc., typically providing bindings to languages such as python, C++, Java).\n\nIn order for neural network models to be shared by different applications, a common language is necessary. The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) has been proposed to address this need. PMML is an XML-based language which provides a way for applications to define and share neural network models (and other data mining models) between PMML compliant applications.\n\nPMML provides applications a vendor-independent method of defining models so that proprietary issues and incompatibilities are no longer a barrier to the exchange of models between applications. It allows users to develop models within one vendor's application, and use other vendors' applications to visualize, analyze, evaluate or otherwise use the models. Previously, this was very difficult, but with PMML, the exchange of models between compliant applications is now straightforward.\n\nA range of products are being offered to produce and consume PMML. This ever-growing list includes the following neural network products:\n\n\n"}

The practice is of particular interest to historians, archaeologists and architectural historians since the gravestones, monuments and architectural fragments of antiquity are frequently found embedded in structures built centuries or millennia later.\n\nArchaeologist Philip A. Barker gives the example of a late Roman period (probably 1st century) tombstone from Wroxeter that could be seen to have been cut down and undergone weathering while in use as part of an exterior wall, then, possibly as late as the 5th century, reinscribed for reuse as a tombstone.\n\nThe practice was common in late antiquity. Entire obsolete structures, including underground foundations, are known to have been demolished to enable the construction of new structures. According to Baxter, two churches in Worcester (one 7th century and one 10th,) are thought to have been deconstructed so that their building stone could be repurposed by St. Wulstan to construct a cathedral in 1084. And the parish churches of Atcham, Wroxeter, and Upton Magna are largely built of stone taken from the buildings of Viroconium Cornoviorum.\n\nRoman examples include the Arch of Janus, the earlier imperial reliefs reused on the Arch of Constantine, the colonnade of Old Saint Peter's Basilica; examples in Byzantine territories include the exterior sculpture on the Panagia Gorgoepikoos church in Athens); in the medieval West Roman tiles were reused in St Albans Cathedral, in much of the medieval architecture of Colchester, porphyry columns in the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, and the colonnade of the basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere. Spolia in the medieval Islamic world include the columns in the hypostyle mosques of Kairouan, Gaza and Cordoba.\n\nAlthough the modern literature on spolia is primarily concerned with these and other medieval examples, the practice is common and there is probably no period of art history in which evidence for \"spoliation\" could not be found.\n\nInterpretations of spolia generally alternate between the \"ideological\" and the \"pragmatic.\" Ideological readings might describe the re-use of art and architectural elements from former empires or dynasties as triumphant (that is, literally as the display of \"spoils\" or \"booty\" of the conquered) or as revivalist (proclaiming the renovation of past imperial glories). Pragmatic readings emphasize the utility of re-used materials: if there is a good supply of old marble columns available, for example, there is no need to produce new ones. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there is certainly no one approach that can account for all instances of spoliation, as each instance must be evaluated within its particular historical context.\n\nSpolia had apotropaic spiritual value. Clive Foss has noted that in the fifth century crosses were inscribed on the stones of pagan buildings, as at Ankara, where crosses were inscribed on the walls of the temple of Roma and Augustus. Clive Foss suggests that the purpose of this was to ward off the \"daimones\" that lurked in stones that had been consecrated to pagan usage.\n\nLiz James extends Foss's observation in noting that statues, laid on their sides and facing outwards, were carefully incorporated in Ankara's city walls in the Seventh century, at a time when spolia were also being built into city walls in Miletus, Sardis, Ephesus and Pergamum: \"laying a statue on its side places it and the power it represents under control. It is a way of acquiring the power of rival gods for one's own benefit,\" Liz James observes. \"Inscribing a cross works similarly, sealing the object for Christian purposes\".\n\n\nThere is a large modern literature on spolia, and the following list makes no claim to be comprehensive.\n"}
{"id": "55175821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55175821", "title": "Suicide awareness", "text": "Suicide awareness\n\nSuicide awareness is a proactive effort to raise awareness around suicidal behaviors. It is focused on reducing social stigmas and ambiguity, by bringing attention to suicide statistically and sociologically, and encouraging positive dialogue and engagement as a means to prevent suicide. Suicide awareness is linked to suicide prevention as both address suicide education and the dissemination of information to ultimately decrease the rate of suicide. Awareness is a critical first stage that ultimately can ease the need for prevention. Awareness signifies a fundamental consciousness of the threat, while prevention focuses on stopping the act. Suicide awareness is not a medical engagement, but a combination of medical, social, emotional and even financial counseling. Suicide awareness in adolescents focuses on the age group between 10–24 years, beginning with the onset of puberty, according to combined definitions and theories found in developmental psychology.\n\nStigma is a negative impact that society can often attribute to the suicidal condition, and which can hinder and prevent positive engagement with those demonstrating suicidal behavior. It can be experienced as self-stigma or cultural, public stigma. Self-stigma is the adverse effect of internalized prejudice, manifesting itself in reduced self-esteem, decreased self-efficacy, and a feeling of “why try” or self-deprecation (undervaluing any attempts to get a job, be social, etc. because of lack of self-worth). It is experienced not only by those facing suicidal thoughts, but also by those directly and indirectly affected such as family members and friends. Public stigma is experienced by prejudice and discrimination through public misuse of stereotypes associated with suicide. \nStigma can create a detrimental barrier for some seeking help. Research has consistently illustrated the physical link between suicide and mental illness, but ignorance and outdated beliefs can sometimes lead to these disorders being identified as a weakness or a lack of willpower. Stigma can prevent survivors of suicide attempts, and those affected by suicide deaths, from reaching out for support from professionals and advocates to make positive change.\n\nHistorically, suicide has not always been considered a societal taboo. It is critical to understand the historical context in order to raise awareness of suicide's impact on our current culture.\n\nSuicide was embraced as a philosophical escape by the followers of the Greek philosopher Epicurus when life's happiness seemed lost. It has been glorified in self-immolation as an act of martyrdom as in the case of Thich Quang Duc who burned himself to death in protest of the Vietnam War. Assisted suicide as a release from suffering can be traced back to ancient Roman society. In Jewish culture, there is a reverence for the mass suicide at masada in the face of attack by the Roman empire, showing how suicide has sometimes had a contradictory relationship with established religion. This indicates a tension between the presentation of suicide in this historical context, and its associations in our current society with personal anguish.\nToday, suicide is generally perceived as an act of despair or hopelessness, or a criminal act of terrorism (suicide attack). This negative backdrop was seen in Colonial America, where suicides were considered criminal and brought to trial, even if mental illness had been present. Suicide was identified in Roman Catholicism as a sinful act, with religious burial prohibited until 1983, when the Catholic Church altered the canon law to allow funerals and burials within the church of those who died by suicide. Today, many current societies and religious traditions condemn suicide, especially in Western culture. Public consideration of suicide in our culture is further complicated by society's struggle to rationalize such cult events as the Jonestown mass suicide. In light of these mixed historical messages, it can be confusing for youth, presented with an academic and historical profile for suicide. The ambiguity of accepted suicide and suicidal behavior definitions impedes progress with its utilization of variable terminology.\n\nToday, even though suicide is considered a public health issue by advocates, the general public often still consider it a private shame; a final desperate solution for the emotionally weak. It is stigmatized in the public perception by being associated with weakness, a “cry for attention,” shame, and depression, without understanding the contributing factors. There can be a visceral and emotional reaction to suicide rather than an attempt to understand it. This reaction is based on stereotypes (overgeneralizations about a group: weak or crazy), prejudices (agreement with stereotypical beliefs and related emotional reactions: Sue attempted suicide; ‘I’m afraid of her’), and discrimination (unfair behavior towards the suicidal individual or group: avoidance; ‘suicidal persons should be locked up’). Erving Goffman defined courtesy stigma as the discrimination, prejudice and stereotypes which family and friends experience as suicide survivors. Public stigma is felt by medical professionals whose clients die by suicide and whose treatment is then questioned by colleagues and in lawsuits, often contributing to their being less inclined to work with suicidal patients. Property can also be stigmatized by suicide: property sellers in certain jurisdictions in the United States, in California for example, are required by law to reveal if a suicide or murder occurred on the premises in the past three years, putting suicide in the same category as homicide.\nThese issues compound and perpetuate the public stigma of suicide, exacerbating the inclination for suicidal individuals, and their family and friends, to bury their experiences, creating a barrier to care.\n\nEmotionally, the negative stigma of suicide is a powerful force creating isolation and exclusion for those in suicidal crisis. The use of stereotypes, discrimination and prejudices can strip the dignity of those experiencing suicidal behavior. It also has the potential to inhibit compassion from others and to diminish hope. Fear of being socially rejected and labeled suicidal can prevent communication and support. Distress and reduced life satisfaction are directly affected by subjective feelings of being devalued and marginalized. This develops into an internalized stigma; it creates self-stigmatized emotions, self-deprecation and self-actualization of negative stereotypes, causing further withdrawal, reduction in quality of life and the inhibiting access to care.\n\nThis emotional stigma also affects suicide survivors: those suffering a loved one's loss, stirring up guilt, self-blame, isolation, depression and post-traumatic stress. Subjective experiences of feeling shunned or blamed for an incident can cause those close to the victim to bury the truth of what transpired.\n\nTrend analysis shows there is an increase in suicide among the youth population. Between 1999-2006, according to the Center for Disease Control, suicide was the third leading cause of death in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years, and the fourth leading cause of death for children aged 10 to 14 years. As of 2011, suicide increased in this age group, becoming the second cause of death for youth between the ages of 15 and 24 years, below homicide statistics and above those of accidents. Within the general population, female teens attempt suicide more frequently than males; however, white males accounted for seven out of 10 suicide deaths in 2015.\n\nAmong college students, suicide has become the second leading cause of death. The National Mental Health Association has divided students at risk for suicide into two groups upon college entrance: those already diagnosed with mental health issues, and those who develop issues while in college. Research suggests poor sleep habits, substance and alcohol experimentation, in addition to academic and social stress, may trigger or worsen mental health issues and increase suicide risk.\n\nGeographically within the United States, western states have statistically higher rates of suicide. Per 100,000 people, Montana is ranked first, Alaska ranked second, and Wyoming is third. There may be a link between these states and firearm regulations, which make access to guns easier, as statistics show firearm suicides in states with the highest rates of gun ownership are 3.7 times higher for men, and 7.9 times higher for women. These are often rural areas without heavily populated urban communities (which brings social pressure stressors), but may indicate a lack of accessibility to medical and psychological health assistance in these remote areas.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, in wealthier countries, three times as many males die by suicide than females, while low and middle-income countries have a lower ratio at 1.5 men to each woman. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15−29-year-olds.\n\nWithin the last 100 years, suicides have outnumbered homicides by 3 to 2. Statistics show that the number of youth who self-harm is increasing, but it is difficult to determine if suicide is the ultimate intention. In 2015, 494,169 people were treated at US hospitals for injuries as a result of self-harm. This suggests approximately 12 people harm themselves for every reported death by suicide. Recent surveys have tallied as many as one million people in the US engaging in intentional self-harm. Many suicides go unreported because of social stigma or are left untreated due to lack of education, which clouds the available statistics.\n\nSuicide does not have one single cause or factor. Suicide is considered to occur most often when stress and pressures exceed the coping abilities of a person suffering from mental health issues. Depressive disorders are considered to be the most frequently associated cause of suicide, but they are often undiagnosed or untreated, and are not always the singular factor.\n<br>\nRisk factors have been evaluated for suicide as characteristic markers or conditions that can increase the chance a person may try to take their life. Odds are significantly increased when several risk factors are present at the same time. The most frequently cited risk factors for suicide are:\n\nOver 90% of suicides in the United States are a result of mental illness and/or alcohol and substance abuse, but 10% of those who die by suicide do not have any psychologically-known diagnosis.\n\nYouth vulnerability to suicide is compounded by the increased levels of impulsivity, more than other age groups, as reported by the United States Institute of Medicine. This can be attributed to neurological and cognitive changes in adolescent brain function, stimulated by a rapid increase in dopamine during puberty. It is also suggested this impulsive, risk-taking behavior is often associated with the early use of alcohol and illegal substances. Abuse of illicit substances and alcohol can also be attributed to family dysfunction and genetic personality traits, and can be a predictor of hopelessness, especially among lonely and isolated youth.\nA comprehensive list of risk factors is outlined on Suicide Prevention Lifeline website.\n\nSuicide awareness expresses the need for open constructive dialogue as an initial step towards preventing incidents of adolescent suicide. Once the stigmas have been overcome, there is an increased possibility that education, medical care and support can provide a critical framework for those at risk. Lack of information, awareness of professional services, judgment and insensitivity from religious groups, and financial strain have all been identified as barriers to support access for those youth in suicidal crisis. The critical framework is a necessary component to implementing suicide awareness and suicide prevention, and breaking down these barriers.\n<br>\nAwareness can focus on the individual with social and non-threatening education (introduced at schools as a foundational program for all adolescents), and on the public and societal level, encompassing media across all platforms to destigmatize suicide and its perpetuation. Education for the individual and public raises awareness to the protective factors that may assist in suicide risk reduction.\n\nProtective factors are characteristics or conditions that may have a positive effect on youth and reduce the possibility of suicide attempts. These factors have not been studied in as much depth as risk factors, so there is less research. They include: \nIt is important to note, however, that in-depth training is paramount for those involved in any service that looks to the awareness and needs of those touched by suicide.\n\nIn a world where social media drives both the activities and knowledge for today's youth, it is important that there is a constructive discourse on the subject of suicide, rather than glamorizing it as an aspect of storytelling. Constructive social media is illustrated in the documentary “The S Word movie” which presents suicide attempt survivors and their stories. It is the mission of the film to uncover personal survivors’ accounts of their conflicts, highlighting their courage, insight and humor. The film aims to create a national community transforming personal struggles into positive action. This project is considered constructive to suicide awareness as, historically, suicide attempt survivors have either not come forward to speak out, or have done so anonymously. This documentary, created by a suicide attempt survivor, encourages them to talk openly of their experiences, so that others can learn from exploring a world that has been stigmatized for too long. Suicide awareness and prevention have in the past only relied on research from clinical observation. In bringing insights, intimate experience, and real-world wisdom of suicide attempt survivors to the table, professionals, educators, other survivors and suicide attempt survivors can learn firsthand from their “lived experience.”\n\nSocial media can also glamorize or romanticize suicide as suggested by media reporter Korin Miller of Self magazine and Phyllis Alongi (clinical director at the Society for the Prevention of Teen Suicide). Miller highlights the negative aspects of the new Netflix show “13 Reasons Why” which had been touted as a suicide awareness and mental health force. Alongi and her organization do not agree with aspects of the show, in which they feel suicide is romanticized, graphic details are depicted, the counselor is portrayed as ineffective, the placing of blame is confusing, and most importantly that teens may not recognize all of this. This opinion is shared by Zoe Williams of the U.S. online edition of The Guardian, stating the Netflix series is aimed at a young audience, susceptible to contagion, who are particularly vulnerable to experiencing suicidal thoughts. Williams argues that the series normalizes and legitimizes the act of suicide.\nMedia and journalism, when reporting on suicide, have moved forward in their discussion of suicide. The Recommendations for Reporting on Suicide discovered the powerful impact media coverage, newspapers and journalists can have on the perpetuating stigma of suicide, and that it can lead to greater risk of occurrence. The specific rules that media representatives should follow are:\nThis is to prevent certain types of messaging around suicide that could increase the chances of at-risk youth considering or attempting suicide. This initiative brought awareness to the sensitivity of reporting on suicide in a constructive, destigmatized method of messaging.\n\nEducation in a non-threatening environment is critical to a growth in awareness among adolescents. Health education is closely related to health awareness. School can be the best place to implement a suicide education program because it is the pivotal location that brings the major influences in an adolescent's life together. Pilot programs for awareness, and coping and resiliency training should be put into place for all adolescent school-aged children to combat life stressors and to encourage healthy communication.\n\nAccording to Dr. John Draper, psychologist and director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, “The best way to effectively prevent suicide is to give voice to the suicidal,\" meaning that their stories can inspire and teach others, and aid in reducing stigma. Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, agrees that it is imperative to encourage suicide attempt survivors to speak up, and is holding focus groups with those who tried to kill themselves. Her message is to treat suicide awareness the same as breast cancer awareness, which also had been stigmatized in the past, but has now been brought into the public eye through research, communication, marketing and survivors speaking out publicly.\n\n\"Send Silence Packing\" is a suicide awareness program trademarked by Active Minds, Inc. to connect college students to mental health resources, raise awareness about the impact of suicide, and inspire action and dialogue regarding suicide. The program uses donated backpacks (from loved ones), each one representing a student lost to suicide, in an exhibition which travels around US college campuses. The backpacks are displayed in the college quads and emphasize the scope of suicide and the connection to real individuals. Since its initial exhibition in 2008 in Washington DC, \"Send Silence Packing\" has traveled to more than 140 cities around the United States. Surveys of students viewing the exhibit rated the experience as “powerful to very powerful” and 97% reported it was very educational. The program determined that each person who witnessed the exhibition told three friends, and that it encourages help-seeking for those viewing it and those they tell about it.\n\nAnother program promoting education is The Center for Suicide Awareness. This organization's mission is to reduce suicide by providing proactive education and support resources to suicide attempt survivors and survivors, in addition to providing student presentations and training for educators, healthcare professionals, youth, police and community leaders. Their environment is compassionate, barrier-free and stigma-free.\n\nThere are also organizations who deal with specifically vulnerable groups. The Trevor Project raises suicide awareness within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ) community, aged 13–24 years of age. Their mission to end suicide is fostered through four strategies: providing crisis counseling to LGBTQ youth considering suicide; offering a sense of non-judgmental community, supportive counseling and resources to reduce risk; educate youth and adults on LGBTQ-competent suicide risk detection and response; and advocacy for laws and policies to reduce suicide in the LGBTQ community.\n\nWith the lack of constructive dialogue and resistance to suicide reporting due to stigma, it is critical to continue to explore the medical science of suicide, using it in a delicate balance with emotional and social education. Researchers have recently looked at developing a measure for suicide stigma, both for suicide attempt survivors and suicide survivors. The Stigma of Suicide Attempt scale (STOSA) and the Stigma of Suicide and Suicide Survivor scale (STOSASS) were created to quantify stigma at the individual level and general population levels. Results underlined the importance of both groups coming forward and participating in a study of this nature. It also illustrated differences in stigma evaluation for suicide attempt survivors and survivors. However, the study was based on self-reporting which can be limited in capturing behavioral attitudes. Also, the scales developed did not distinguish whether suicide stigma is specific to suicide or to mental illness in general. Still, the researchers believe STOSA and STOSASS could be beneficial in predicting therapeutic intervention outcomes for suicide attempters and survivors. More in-depth research needs to be continued on this, as well as exploring internalized stigma, which has not been measured thus far.\n"}

The theory was developed by Andras Pellionisz and Rodolfo Llinas in the 1980s as a geometrization of brain function (especially of the central nervous system) using tensors.\n\nThe mid-20th century saw a concerted movement to quantify and provide geometric models for various fields of science, including biology and physics. The geometrization of biology began in the 1950s in an effort to reduce concepts and principles of biology down into concepts of geometry similar to what was done in physics in the decades before. In fact, much of the geometrization that took place in the field of biology took its cues from the geometrization of contemporary physics. One major achievement in general relativity was the geometrization of gravitation. This allowed the trajectories of objects to be modeled as geodesic curves (or optimal paths) in a Riemannian space manifold. During the 1980s, the field of theoretical physics also witnessed an outburst of geometrization activity in parallel with the development of the Unified Field Theory, the Theory of Everything, and the similar Grand Unified Theory, all of which attempted to explain connections between known physical phenomena.\n\nThe geometrization of biology in parallel with the geometrization of physics covered a multitude of fields, including populations, disease outbreaks, and evolution, and continues to be an active field of research even today. By developing geometric models of populations and disease outbreaks, it is possible to predict the extent of the epidemic and allow public health officials and medical professionals to control disease outbreaks and better prepare for future epidemics. Likewise, there is work being done to develop geometric models for the evolutionary process of species in order to study the process of evolution, the space of morphological properties, the diversity of forms and spontaneous changes and mutations.\n\nAround the same time as all of the developments in the geometrization of biology and physics, some headway was made in the geometrization of neuroscience. At the time, it became more and more necessary for brain functions to be quantified in order to study them more rigorously. Much of the progress can be attributed to the work of Pellionisz and Llinas and their associates who developed the tensor network theory in order to give researchers a means to quantify and model central nervous system activities.\n\nIn 1980, Pellionisz and Llinas introduced their tensor network theory to describe the behavior of the cerebellum in transforming afferent sensory inputs into efferent motor outputs. They proposed that intrinsic multidimensional central nervous system space could be described and modeled by an extrinsic network of tensors that together describe the behavior of the central nervous system. By treating the brain as a \"geometrical object\" and assuming that (1) neuronal network activity is vectorial and (2) that the networks themselves are organized tensorially, brain function could be quantified and described simply as a network of tensors.\n\nIn 1986, Pellionisz described the geometrization of the \"three-neuron vestibulo-ocular reflex arc\" in a cat using tensor network theory. The \"three-neuron vestibulo-ocular reflex arc\" is named for the three neuron circuit the arc comprises. Sensory input into the vestibular system (angular acceleration of the head) is first received by the primary vestibular neurons which subsequently synapse onto secondary vestibular neurons. These secondary neurons carry out much of the signal processing and produce the efferent signal heading for the oculomotor neurons. Prior to the publishing of this paper, there had been no quantitative model to describe this \"classic example of a basic sensorimotor transformation in the central nervous system\" which is precisely what tensor network theory had been developed to model.\n<br>\n<br> \nHere, Pellionisz described the analysis of the sensory input into the vestibular canals as the covariant vector component of tensor network theory. Likewise, the synthesized motor response (reflexive eye movement) is described as the contravariant vector component of the theory. By calculating the neuronal network transformations between the sensory input into the vestibular system and the subsequent motor response, a metric tensor representing the neuronal network was calculated.\n\nThe resulting metric tensor allowed for accurate predictions of the neuronal connections between the three intrinsically orthogonal vestibular canals and the six extraocular muscles that control the movement of the eye.\n\nNeural networks modeled after the activities of the central nervous system have allowed researchers to solve problems impossible to solve by other means. Artificial neural networks are now being applied in various applications to further research in other fields.\nOne notable non-biological application of the tensor network theory was the simulated automated landing of a damaged F-15 fighter jet on one wing using a \"Transputer parallel computer neural network\". The fighter jet's sensors fed information into the flight computer which in turn transformed that information into commands to control the plane's wing-flaps and ailerons to achieve a stable touchdown. This was synonymous to sensory inputs from the body being transformed into motor outputs by the cerebellum. The flight computer's calculations and behavior was modeled as a metric tensor taking the covariant sensor readings and transforming it into contravariant commands to control aircraft hardware.\n\n"}
{"id": "1740882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1740882", "title": "The Chips Are Down (screenplay)", "text": "The Chips Are Down (screenplay)\n\nThe Chips Are Down () is a screenplay written by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1943 and published in 1947. The original title translates literally as \"The Plays are Made\", an idiomatic French expression used mainly in casino gambling meaning \"the bets have been placed.\" It is also the French translation of Alea iacta est. An English translation (no longer in print) was made from the French by Louise Varese in 1948, and published as \"The Chips Are Down\".\n\nThe story is set in Paris, in a setting vaguely suggestive of German-occupied northern France (or perhaps Vichy France) during World War II. The plot concerns two characters, Pierre Dumaine and Ève Charlier. They are predestined to be soulmates, but this destiny is prevented by their premature violent deaths, and they do not meet until passing into the afterlife.\n\nÈve and Pierre have never met each other in their respective lives. At the beginning of the book, Ève is very sick, and unknown to her, her husband André is poisoning her in order to marry her sister Lucette and keep the dowry. Pierre on the other hand is planning a revolution, but is killed by his friend Lucien. Both Pierre and Ève do not realize that they have been dead for a while. Pierre and Ève realize different truths about their own lives as they walk invisibly as ghosts amongst the living, with the power to interact only with other deceased souls. Pierre and Ève have difficulty adjusting to this powerless condition. They meet each other in line to register at a bureaucratic clearing house for the recently deceased where both of them slowly find out that there has been a mistake in the paperwork. They are surprised to learn that according to article 140, they were predestined to be soulmates.\n\nSuccessfully appealing their case, Pierre and Ève are brought back to life and given twenty-four hours to show their love to each other, or their second chance at living will be revoked. However, they are each distracted by unfinished business from their previous lives. Because Ève was poisoned by her husband, she wants to convince her sister that he is not a good man. Pierre wants to stop the revolution to overthrow the Regency that he had planned, because in death he discovered the Regent knew about it, and realizes that if carried out, it will result in the massacre of his friends and the end of the resistance.\n\nUnable to explain the unique circumstances in which they acquired their knowledge, they both have difficulty convincing their friends that they know what is the right thing to do. Neither is able to completely dissociate themselves from the things that were once important to them, and they realize that by not concentrating on their love they might be sacrificing their second chance at life.\n\nPierre Dumaine – Pierre is a leader of an underground resistance movement against the local Regent in the unnamed city in which the story is set. His death was a result of a betrayal by Lucien, another member of the rebellion, and a police informant.\n\nÈve Charlier – Ève is the wife of André Charlier, the Chief of the Militia (\"Milice\"). Like Pierre, her death is a result of betrayal. Her husband André slowly killed her by poisoning her drinks as she lay stricken in bed, in order to inherit her wealth and marry her beautiful younger sister for her dowry.\n\nAndré Charlier – Ève's husband,the Chief of the Militia (\"Milice\"), who kills her and is warming up to Lucette\n\nLucette – Ève's sister, who is very naive\n\nPierre and Ève are permitted to return to the living for the express purpose of falling in love. But in the afterlife they have seen terrible things that they overlooked while living and attempt to prevent these things from occurring, rather than loving one another. After 24 hours, the pair die once more, having accomplished nothing besides saving a young girl, Marie Astruc, whose life Eve and Pierre promised her father (a man referred to in the boutique of the dead) they would improve. While they managed to succeed in their quest to better Marie's life they fail in the consummation of their love. This reinforces Sartre's view that one is condemned to follow one's choices (see determinism), no matter how good or bad. He also shows that it is impossible to know if a choice is right, even if it is done with the best possible motivations. To Sartre, there is no absolute truth or morality. Instead, he suggests in this screenplay that destiny will always win over the power of life.\n\nSartre shows that though freedom is perhaps an illusion, it is also a necessity. Pierre and Ève realize the absurdity of death as they wander the streets and witness the problems of friends and loved ones after their second demise. They are powerless to help and thus powerless to relieve themselves of their own suffering in reaction to what they see; they are forced to view life, yet they cannot participate in it themselves since they are mere ghosts. All that keeps us from leading useless, fleeting lives is our power and freedom to interact with the surrounding world according to our own choices.\n\nA film adaptation directed by Jean Delannoy was made in 1947, with Micheline Presle playing the role of Eve and Marcello Pagliero as Pierre.\n"}

When Vadym was 12, he moved to Lviv and enrolled in the Lviv sports boarding school (today Lviv Sports College). His first football coach was Fred Bushansky. Among his classmantes was Bohdan Samardak and many others. In the tenth grade Tyshchenko joined Komsomol of Ukraine. He graduated the boarding school back 1981 and soon appeared in Vinnytsia playing for the Second League team Nyva Vinnytsia that was coached by Yukhym Shkolnykov.\n\nIn 1983 Nyva placed fifth in the Second League and Tyshchenko was approached by scouts of Dynamo Kyiv and joined the big club. In 1984 together with the team he visited the United States and got a $40 hair cut. Tyshchenko did not stayed in the club for long and after a year ran away. In 1985 as part of military obligation, he joined SKA Karpaty Lviv that played in the Soviet First League. Tyshchenko played for the club two full seasons in 77 games scoring 11 goals.\n\nFinally, in 1987 Kucherevsky, who noticed Tyshchenko when he played for Nyva, invited him to Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. In 1988 Tyshchenko became a champion of the Soviet Union playing for Dnipro. Yet already since 1987 Lobanovsky started to invite him for the Soviet Union national football team. Tyshchenko however most of his time dedicated to the Soviet Union Olympic football team that won gold medals in Seoul. He did not played a single game in finals, but also received the Olympic gold medal. Tyshchenko had to miss most of the 1988 Soviet Top League season and the 1988 European Championship (where Soviet team lost in the final) due to his injury of meniscus that he received on 12 March 1988 playing against Metalist Kharkiv. He was hospitalized to one of Moscow's hospitals. Tyshchenko however returned to Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk in 1989 and that season the club won the Soviet Cup. He also was a candidate for the national team, but later did not make list for the finals in Italy (1990 FIFA World Cup).\n\nTyshchenko stayed with Dnipro for another couple of years during which the Soviet Union fell apart and Vadym started to play in the Higher League of Ukraine where Dnipro won bronze medals against Shakhtar Donetsk. In 1992 along with Volodymyr Horilyi, he joined Hapoel Haifa F.C. in Israel where he played another two season. Tyshchenko retired in 1994 after he was hospitalized again due to another foot injury already in Israel. During the hospitalization he experienced several surgeries during which had his hip and knee joints replaced.\n\nIn summer of 1996 Tyshchenko returned to Dnipro where he was an assistant of Vyacheslav Hroznyi. Since then with insignificant pauses, he stayed in the club for some 15 years as coaching staff.\n\nTyshchenko was married for 27 years to his wife Svitlana. He was also survived by his daughter Kateryna and son Serhii.\n\n\nTyshchenko made his debut for USSR on 29 August 1987 in a friendly against Yugoslavia. He played in UEFA Euro 1988 qualifiers, but was not selected for the squad for that tournament or for the 1990 FIFA World Cup.\n\n"}
{"id": "859072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=859072", "title": "Vesting", "text": "Vesting\n\nIn law, vesting is to give an immediately secured right of present or future deployment. One has a vested right to an asset that cannot be taken away by any third party, even though one may not yet possess the asset. When the right, interest, or title to the present or future possession of a legal estate can be transferred to any other party, it is termed a vested interest.\n\nThe concept can arise in any number of contexts, but the most common are inheritance law and retirement plan law. In real estate, to vest is to create an entitlement to a privilege or a right. For example, one may cross someone else’s property regularly and unrestrictedly for several years, and one’s right to an easement becomes vested. The original owner still retains the possession, but can no longer prevent the other party from crossing.\n\nSome bequests do not vest immediately upon death of the testator. For example, many wills specify that an heir who dies within a set period (such as 60 days) is not to inherit, and further specify how the corresponding share is to be distributed. This is generally done to obviate disputes over the precise time of death, and to avoid paying taxes twice in rapid succession should multiple members of a family die in the wake of a disaster. Such a bequest does not vest until the expiration of the specified period, because the actual heir cannot be determined with certainty.\n\nIt is also possible to give a person, A, a life interest in a property, with the remainder to go to another person or persons, B. If the beneficiary of the remainder cannot yet be known, then the remainder is said not to have vested, and the remainder is said to be contingent. This may happen with entailed estates, or when property is left in trust to care for a child or relative without heirs. (See trust law for details).\n\nVesting is an issue in conjunction with employer contributions to an employee stock option plan, deferred compensation plan, or to a retirement plan such as a 401(k), annuity or pension plan.\n\nA vested right is \"an absolute right; when a plan is fully vested, the employee has an absolute right to the entire amount of money in the account\". It is a \"basic right that has been granted, or has accrued, and cannot be taken away\"; for example. one has a right to a vested pension.\n\nGenerally, the portion \"vested\" cannot be reclaimed by the employer, nor can it be used to satisfy the employer's debts. Any portion not vested may be forfeited under certain conditions, such as termination of employment. The portion invested is often determined pro-rata.\n\nGenerally, for retirement plans in the United States, employees are fully vested in their own salary deferral contributions upon inception. For employer contributions, however, the employer has limited options under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to delay the vesting of their contributions to the employee. For example, the employer can say that the employee must work with the company for three years or they lose any employer contributed money, which is known as \"cliff vesting\". Or it can choose to have the 20% of the contributions vest each year over five years, known as \"graduated vesting\".\n\nChoosing a vesting plan allows an employer to selectively reward employees who remain employed for a period of time. In theory, this allows the employer to make greater contributions than would otherwise be prudent, because the money they contribute on behalf of employees goes to the ones they most want to reward.\n\nSmall entrepreneurial companies usually offer grants of common stock or positions in an employee stock option plan to employees and other key participants such as contractors, board members, advisors and major vendors. To make the reward commensurate with the extent of contribution, encourage loyalty, and avoid spreading ownership widely among former participants, these grants are usually subject to vesting arrangements.\n\nVesting of options is straightforward. The grantee receives an option to purchase a block of common stock, typically on commencement of employment, which vests over time. The option may be exercised at any time but only with respect to the vested portion. The entire option is lost if not exercised within a short period after the end of the employer relationship. The vesting operates simply by changing the status of the option over time from fully unexercisable to fully exercisable according to the vesting schedule.\n\nCommon stock grants are similar in function but the mechanism is different. An employee, typically a company founder, purchases stock in the company at nominal price shortly after the company is formed. The company retains a repurchase right to buy the stock back at the same price should the employee leave. The repurchase right diminishes over time so that the company eventually has no right to repurchase the stock (in other words, the stock becomes fully vested).\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, vesting periods in the United States are usually 3–5 years for employees, but shorter for board members and others whose expected tenure at a company is shorter. The vesting schedule is most often a pro-rata monthly vesting over the period with a six or twelve month cliff. Alternative vesting models are becoming more popular including milestone-based vesting and dynamic equity vesting.\n\nIn the case of both stock and options, large initial grants that vest over time are more common than periodic smaller grants because they are easier to account for and administer, they establish the arrangement up-front and are thus more predictable, and (subject to some complexities and limitations) the value of the grants and holding period requirements for tax purposes are set upon the initial grant date, giving a considerable tax advantage to the employee.\n\nProfit-sharing plans are usually vested in ten years, although in some cases a plan may serve essentially as a pension by allowing a limited amount of vesting should the employee retire or leave on good terms after an extended period of employment.\n\nThe vested rights doctrine is the rule of zoning law by which an owner or developer is entitled to proceed in accordance with the prior zoning provision where there has been a substantial change of position, expenditures, or incurrence of obligations made in good faith by an innocent party under a building permit or in reliance upon the probability of its issuance.\n\nA \"vesting period\" is a period of time an investor or other person holding a right to something must wait until they are capable of fully exercising their rights and until those rights may not be taken away.\n\nIn many cases vesting does not occur all at once. Specific portions of the rights grant vest on different dates over the duration of the period of the vesting. When part of a right is vested and part remains unvested, it is considered \"partly vested\".\n\nIn cases of partial vesting, a \"vesting schedule\" is a table or chart showing the portion of a right that is vested over time; typically the schedule provides for equal portions to vest on periodic vesting dates, usually once per day, month, quarter, or year, in stairstep fashion over the course of the vesting period. Often there is a cliff by which the first few steps in the graph are missing, so that there is no vesting at all for a period (usually six or twelve months in the case of employee equity), after which there is a cliff date upon which a large amount of vesting occurs all at once.\n\nSome arrangements provide for \"accelerated vesting\", by which all or a major portion of the unvested right vests all at once upon the occurrence of a specified event such as a termination of employment by the company or acquisition of the company by another. Less commonly, the vesting schedule may call for variable grants or subject to conditions such as reaching milestones or employee performance. \"Graded vesting\" (vesting after each year until the employee is fully vested) may be \"uniform\" (e.g., 20% of the compensation vested each year for five years) or \"non-uniform\" (e.g., 20%, 30%, and 50% of the compensation vested each year for the next three years).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1913317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1913317", "title": "Willi Münzenberg", "text": "Willi Münzenberg\n\nWilhelm \"Willi\" Münzenberg (14 August 1889, Erfurt, Germany – June 1940, Saint-Marcellin, France) was a communist political activist. Münzenberg was the first head of the Young Communist International in 1919–20 and established the famine-relief and propaganda organization Workers International Relief in 1921. He was a leading propagandist for the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) during the Weimar Era, but later grew disenchanted with Communism due to Joseph Stalin's Great Purge of the 1930s. Condemned by Stalin to be purged and arrested for treason, Münzenberg left the KPD and in Paris became a leader of the German émigré anti-fascism and anti-Stalinist community until forced to flee the Nazi advance into France in 1940. Arrested and imprisoned by the Daladier government in France, he escaped prison camp only to be found dead a few months later in a forest near the commune of Saint-Marcellin, France.\n\nMünzenberg was born 14 August 1889 in Erfurt, in the Prussian Province of Saxony (present-day Thuringia). The son of a tavern keeper, Münzenberg grew up in poverty. As a young man, he became involved with trade unions and in the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Following the SPD split in 1914 between the moderate majority (known as the Majority SPD, MSPD) and the radical minority (known as the Independent SPD, USPD) over the issue of the First World War, Münzenberg sided with the Independent faction.\n\nDuring World War I, Münzenberg often visited Vladimir Lenin at his home in Zürich, Switzerland. In 1918, Münzenberg was a founding member of the KPD.\n\nMünzenberg was also the head of the Young Communist International and was the delegate of the YCI to the 2nd World Congress of the Communist International in 1920.\n\nIn 1924, Münzenberg was elected to the \"Reichstag\" and served as a member until the banning of the KPD in 1933. Münzenberg was one of the few KPD leaders of working-class origin, a fact that was a source of immense pride for Münzenberg.\n\nDuring the Weimar period, Münzenberg earned the reputation of a brilliant propagandist. His first major success was an effort to raise money and food for the victims of the Russian famine of 1921. Through his famous Berlin organization \"Internationale Arbeiter-Hilfe\" (International Workers' Aid or IAH, also known as Worker's International Relief or WIR), based in Berlin, Münzenberg was reputed to have sent millions of dollars' worth of aid to the Soviet Union during the famine. In 1924 he launched \"Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung\", which became the most widely read socialist pictorial newspaper in Germany. In addition, Münzenberg worked closely with the Comintern and the Soviet secret police (known as the Cheka in 1917–22 and as the OGPU in 1922–34) to advance the communist cause internationally.\n\nIn order to broaden the Comintern's influence, Münzenberg created numerous front organizations he termed \"Innocents' Clubs\". These front groups, such the Friends of Soviet Russia, the World League Against Imperialism, and the International Worker's Relief Fund, were superficially devoted to an undeniably benign cause such as famine relief, anti-imperialism, or peace, but Münzenberg created them to enlist the support of liberals and moderate socialists in defending the Bolshevik revolution. As he told a fellow Comintern member, \"These people have the belief they are actually doing this themselves. This belief must be preserved at any price.\" The front organizations, in turn, helped fund the acquisition of the Münzenberg Trust, a collection of small newspapers, publishing houses, movie houses, and theatres in locations around the world. Münzenberg, referred to by some as the \"Red Millionaire\", used the businesses to pay for a limousine and an elegantly furnished apartment for himself.\n\nAfter directing the Comintern's handling of the Sacco and Vanzetti case in 1925, Münzenberg took charge of the League against Imperialism, created in Brussels in 1927.\nThe World Congress Against War was held in Amsterdam on 27–29 August 1932 and was attended by more than 2,000 delegates from 27 countries.\nFollowing the meeting, Münzenberg formed the permanent World Committee Against War and Fascism, based in Berlin.\nThe Executive Committee of the Communist International was uncomfortable with Münzenberg's views and replaced him by Georgi Dimitrov. \nEarly the next year, Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany. The World Committee had to move its headquarters to Paris and Münzenberg resumed the leadership.\n\nDimitrov was arrested and tried on a charge of responsibility for the Reichstag fire.\nThe League Against Imperialism organised a countertrial, which concluded that the Nazis had set the 1933 Reichstag fire themselves.\nBarred from entering Britain during the trial, Münzenberg toured the northeastern and midwestern United States on a June 1934 speaking tour with Welsh Labour figure Aneurin Bevan, Babette Gross and SPD lawyer Kurt Rosenfeld. Speaking at well-attended rallies at venues like Madison Square Garden and the Bronx Coliseum, he appeared alongside Sinclair Lewis and Malcolm Cowley.\nLater in 1934, Münzenberg's influence reached the antipodes when his Comintern machine sent Egon Kisch to the All-Australian Conference of the Movement Against War and Fascism (an Australian Communist Party front organization). What could have been a lowkey visit from an unknown Czech writer quickly polarized Australian society when the Joseph Lyons government declared Kisch as \"undesirable as an inhabitant of, or visitor to, the Commonwealth\" and attempted to exclude Kisch from Australia. With the government unable to produce any legal proof that Kisch was a communist, its case collapsed, and Kisch became a popular speaker disseminating Münzenberg's Comintern message. However, attempts to foster a United Front against fascism in Australia eventually came to nothing.\n\nMünzenberg instructed his assistant, fellow Comintern agent Otto Katz, to travel to the United States to garner support for various pro-Soviet and anti-Nazi causes, as part of the 1935 Comintern Seventh World Congress' proclamation of a \"Peoples' Front Against Fascism\", aka the Popular Front. Katz made his way to Hollywood, and in July 1936 he formed the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League with Dorothy Parker. Many artists and writers in the U.S. flocked to join the Popular Front, the Anti-Nazi League, and related groups such as the League of American Writers, and movie stars such as Paul Muni, Melvyn Douglas, and James Cagney all agreed to sponsor the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League.\n\nMünzenberg lived intermittently in Paris from 1933 to 1940. He took a common-law wife, Babette Gross, a party member who had separated from her husband shortly after her marriage. It has been suggested that during his years in exile, Münzenberg had some role in recruiting Kim Philby to work for the Soviet Union, but there is no clear evidence. The argument for the theory is that Philby was recruited to work for Soviet intelligence by one of the Münzenberg Trust's front organizations, the World Society for the Relief of the Victims of German Fascism based in Paris.\n\nUntil 1936, Münzenberg remained loyal to Joseph Stalin and to the aims of Soviet foreign policy. In late 1936, fellow KPD exile Walter Ulbricht, who had parted ways with Münzenberg over the latter's refusal to carry out Stalin's directive to purge the KPD, urged him to take up an offer by Bulgarian Communist party leader Georgi Dimitrov, then residing in Moscow, to return there and assume other missions on behalf of the Comintern. Münzenberg refused, stating that he could not go to the Soviet Union unless he had assurances that he could leave Moscow when he was ready. He was also concerned that controls on his movements in Moscow and the inevitable delays in getting permission to visit others would greatly impede his work, and he may also have suspected that he would be implicated and liquidated in the same Stalinist purges his disinformation organizations had previously sought to obscure by propaganda statements. Ulbricht appears to have been well aware of Münzenberg's probable fate if he returned to Moscow since he had been communicating to Moscow reports on Münzenberg \"deviance\" from Stalinist orthodoxy. (One of Ulbricht's coworkers allegedly stated to a party cell, \"Wenn Münzenberg gefahren wäre, wäre er schon erschossen\" (if Münzenberg had gone [to Moscow], he would have already been shot by now). In Paris, Ulbricht revealed to Otto Klepper, the German jurist and former Prussian minister of finance, \"Wir schicken ihn nur nach Moskau, damit er erledigt wird\" (We're sending him to Moscow so that he is liquidated).\n\nShortly after urging Münzenberg to visit Moscow, Ulbricht traveled to Republican Spain, where his work consisted of identifying \"disloyal\" German communists (anyone not totally loyal to Stalin) who were fighting on the Republican side in Spain; the men were either returned to the Soviet Union to face a tribunal or executed on the spot. From Spain, Ulbricht went directly to Paris, where, over protest from some Committee members, he began purging the Popular Front Committee (PFC) of individuals \"disloyal\" to Stalin. In less than two years \"virtually all the writers who had been willing to work closely with the Comintern and their publisher Willi Münzenberg would be driven out or murdered by the NKVD\".\n\nMünzenberg was becoming increasingly marginalized by the actions of his Stalinist opponents, and in an October 1937 letter to Dimitrov, he threatened to reveal every detail of his secret work for the Comintern to the public to show that he was being falsely accused. In the KPD, which was rapidly being reorganized to conform to Stalinist doctrine, Münzenberg was officially condemned as a traitor who had deviated from Marxism–Leninism. Münzenberg responded by resisting any attempt to expel him from the Communist movement, and his protests and arguments grew in acrimony and intensity. In late 1938, the chairman of the KPD Wilhelm Pieck concluded during a meeting of party leadership, \"Hauptgefahr jetzt nicht Trotzkismus, sondern Münzenberg\" (The present danger is not Trotskyism but Münzenberg). Unknown to Münzenberg or the leaders of the KPD, his fate had already been determined in 1937 by Stalin. In that year, Dimitrov had noted in his diary of a private conversation with Stalin regarding Münzenberg in which Stalin had exclaimed, \"Münzenberg is a Trotskyist. If he comes (to Moscow), we will arrest him. Give some thought on how to best to lure him here.\"\n\nHaving been expelled from the German Communist Party (KPD) on trumped-up charges, Münzenberg finally moved into open opposition to Stalin. A final article on the disgraced propagandist in the Comintern journal \"Die Internationale\" warned, \"Unser fester Wille, die Einheit unter den Antifaschistischen herzustellen, unser Gefühl der Verantwortlichkeit vor dem deutschen Volk macht es uns daher zur Pflicht, vor Münzenberg zu warnen. \"Er ist ein Feind!\"\" (\"Our unshaking determination to unify anti-Fascists, our sense of duty before the German people, obliges us to warn them about Münzenberg. \"He is an enemy!)\n\nBack in Paris, Münzenberg became a genuine leader of German émigré antifascism and a confirmed anti-Stalinist. His new journal, \"Die Zukunft\", was the intellectual forerunner of \"Encounter\" and other Cold War publications. Münzenberg continued to work on behalf of antifascist causes throughout Western Europe, where he played a role in organizing the recruitment and acquisition of Soviet arms for the International Brigades to fight for the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nHowever, his time was running out. His closest professional associates in the party, Karl Radek, Heinz Neumann, and countless others were arrested and either shot or worked to death in Soviet concentration camps. Margarete Buber-Neumann, Heinz Neumann's wife and the sister of his common-law wife Babette Gross, was arrested and imprisoned in Karaganda. The NKVD eventually arranged for her to be handed over to Hitler in 1940, inadvertently saving her life. After spending the war in the relative safety of Ravensbrück concentration camp, she fled at the end of the war, reaching safety with Anglo-American forces just ahead of the advancing Soviet troops.\n\nIn June 1940, Münzenberg fled from Paris, where he had been making anti-Nazi broadcasts, to escape the advance of German forces. While in the south of France, he was imprisoned by the Daladier government at \"Camp militaire de Chambaran\", an internment camp located in the great \"Forêt des Chambarans\" (Chambaran Forest) near the commune of Roybon, in southeastern France. There, another camp inmate, unknown to Münzenberg and his colleagues, befriended Münzenberg and proposed that the two of them escape in the chaos of the Armistice. Some sources believe the unknown communist was actually an agent of Lavrentiy Beria's NKVD. Münzenberg agreed, and he, the stranger, and several of Münzenberg's colleagues (including Valentin Hartig, a former SPD official, and Hans Siemsen, Münzenberg's \"Brown Books\" collaborator) fled southward, in the direction of the Swiss border . Münzenberg disappeared a few days later; it was the last anyone saw of him alive.\n\nOn October 17, 1940, in the Bois de Caugnet between Saint-Antoine-l'Abbaye and Montagne, near Saint Marcellin, French hunters discovered Münzenberg's partially decomposed corpse at the foot of an oak tree. The initial newspaper report stated that the cause of death was strangulation caused by a \"knotted cord\" but other sources state that the cause of death was a garrote (a weapon usually formed from a knotted rope or cord). The body was found resting upright on the knees, with a knotted cord draped over the skull. The knotted cord had apparently snapped soon after the body had been suspended from an overhead branch. The police investigation of the circumstances of his death, including the brief coroner's report, did not interrogate Münzenberg's fellow camp inmates, and cause of death was listed officially as suicide. However, several eyewitnesses at the prison camp, including Valentin Hartig and Hans Siemsen, reported that Münzenberg remained in high spirits both during his days at Chambaran and in the first days of his flight to freedom after which they lost sight of their comrade. That tends to support the conclusion that Münzenberg was intentionally killed, either by Soviet NKVD agents or by party members acting on Stalin's orders.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, members of Münzenberg's circle that had survived both Stalin's purges and the war were closely tracked by the \"Abteilung Personalpolitik\" of the \"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschland\" (SED), the predecessor to the Stasi, the state security service of East Germany. Among the most notable was the return to Paris of Münzenberg's former companion, Babette Gross, who, since 1940, had been living in Mexico with the former Prussian finance minister Otto Klepper and married him after returning to Paris in 1947. SED agents reported that Gross was \"spreading rumors\" that Münzenberg had been murdered by Soviet state security agents.\n\nAnother theory is that Münzenberg was killed by German agents working for the Gestapo, who had apparently infiltrated his organization in 1939. One of the most notable documents in the BStU (Bundesbeauftragte für die Stasi-Unterlagen, or East German Stasi state security files) is a letter referring to information obtained from the prewar \"Deutschen Institut für Militärgeschichte\" files in Potsdam. The letter was authored by the head of Haupabteilung I, Generalmajor Kleinjung , to Erich Mielke, who at the time was the Minister of State Security. Kleinjung informed him on 10 June 1969 that there was proof that a secret agent of the Gestapo with the code name V 49 had infiltrated Münzenberg's group in 1939. The identity of the agent remains unknown. The widely circulated theory that he was executed by the NKVD was also countered by the theory of Wilhelm Leo's son, Gerhard, in his reminiscences of the French Résistence - that Wilhelm Leo escaped the Chambaran Internment Camp with Münzenberg and confirmed that he committed suicide, as confirmed by French investigators.\n\n\n"}
