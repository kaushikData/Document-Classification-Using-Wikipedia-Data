He frequently distinguished himself in battle by wearing a red band on his head, and engaged in bravado before fighting by strutting in front of his adversaries. In the Battle of Uhud, Muhammad gave Abu Dujana his sword as the often cited hadith narration reads:\n\nDuring the Battle of Uhud, Abu Dujana pierced into the enemy's lines, and even came within striking distance to the notorious Quraish leader, Hind bint Utbah who was encouraging others to mutilate the body of dead Muslims. According to various accounts, Abu Dujana spared her since he did not want to stain Muhammad's sword with the blood of a woman.\n\nAbu Dujana, during the Battle of Uhud, received several wounds in his back after placing himself around Muhammad so as to act as a protection from arrows.\n\nAbu Dujana is mentioned in other hadiths including in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim (see also 23:4887) he is found being served a drink by Anas alongside Abu Suhail bin Al-Baida' made from unripe and ripe dates. When the prohibition came on alcoholic drinks, Anas promptly rid them of this drink (he threw it away).\n\nHe died in Battle of Yamama in 632.

That they might have drowned when their canoe accidentally flipped in a rapid is entirely likely according to Trigger, and the myth of martyrdom was likely a \"tendentious fabrication\" to leverage Indian alliances.\n\n"}

She began swimming when she was still a baby and won a gold medal in a 25-meter swimming competition at only age two. She became a seasoned scuba diver by age thirteen but did not get full certification until her sixteenth birthday due to French law. She was still in her teens when her family moved to Mexico City and, fluent in the Spanish language, she eventually studied marine biology at a university in La Paz, Mexico.\n\nIn 1996 her interest in underwater sports led to her meeting free-diver Francisco \"Pipín\" Ferreras. They immediately developed a relationship and Mestre soon moved to Miami, Florida to live with Ferreras. There, she took up serious free-diving and with Ferreras as her instructor was soon reaching record depths. In 1999 the two diving aficionados married and the following year, off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Audrey Mestre broke the female world record by free diving to a depth of 125 meters (410 ft) on a single breath of air. A year later she broke her own record, by descending to 130 meters (427 ft).\n\nOn October 4, 2002, with a dive team under her husband's supervision, she made a practice dive off Bayahibe Beach in the Dominican Republic to the record depth of 166 metres (545 ft). After more deep dive practices, eight days later she prepared to attempt a dive to 171 metres, but at the bottom a problem developed with the lift balloon as she started her ascent. A dive that should have been no more than three minutes resulted in her remaining underwater for more than eight and a half minutes. By the time her husband was able to bring her unconscious body to the surface, it was too late and she was pronounced dead at a hospital on shore.\n\nAudrey Mestre was cremated, her ashes scattered at sea. In 2002, she was inducted posthumously into the Women Divers Hall of Fame and in August 2004 a book that tells her story was written by her husband and published under the title \"The Dive: A Story of Love and Obsession\" ().\n\nIn 2013, Mestre's life and career were chronicled in ESPN's \"No Limits\" as part of their \"Nine for IX\" series.\n"}

{"id": "2297841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297841", "title": "Batou", "text": "Batou\n\nBatou's serves as pointman whose combat specialty is \"near combat.\" Batou often acts as the Section 9 team's comedic relief.\n\nBatou's limbs are all cybernetic; despite the fact that exercise provides negligible benefit, Batou enjoys jogging and weightlifting as a hobby. Shirow's characterization of Batou in the manga, and indeed the other members of Section 9, is notably more light-hearted than the characterization used in Mamoru Oshii's films of the same name. His eyes, though cybernetic, often bulge comically when he is alarmed. He frequently jokes with Motoko, Togusa, the Tachikomas, and practically everyone else who crosses his path. His serious side becomes much more pronounced in a chapter of the manga where Yano, a trainee of Batou's, is murdered by a cybercriminal named Koil Krasnov. Batou loses his temper and impulsively calls up Section 9 Chief Aramaki, demanding an explanation for Yano's death, then storms off announcing (in the English translation), \"That… Koil is dead meat!\"\n\nBatou had seemingly hated anyone who tried to make Section 9 fix the mess of another organization, such as the AI hijacking of the Jigabachi choppers in the SAC series. However, in the \"Ghost in the Shell\" movie he appears more stoic and silent than his TV and manga counterpart. Particularly in \"Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence\", Batou also appears moderately distant and possibly bitter. In addition, he jokes around with a hint of irony being mentioned.\n\n\"Stand Alone Complex\" character designer Hajime Shimomura said that Batou's image was based on the Minotaur.\n\nWhile his name is officially romanized as \"Batou\", in some copies of the first film's subtitles and credits, it is spelled \"Bateau\" (the French word for \"boat\").\n\nThe name \"Batou\" means \"horse\" in Japanese and may refer to Japanese Buddhism's Batou Kannon (Horse-Headed Kannon) with his small robotic implant eyes and long face as visual references. It also means \"eight-headed\" in Mandarin Chinese, which is significant since \"Kusanagi\" was the name of a sword that was taken from Orochi, an eight-headed and eight-tailed mountain dragon in Japanese mythology.\n\nOf all Section 9 characters, Batou is closest with the Major professionally and in civilian life. Even on missions, he is known to disregard her rank or authority to \"speak freely\" without permission.\n\nBatou originally appeared in the manga authored by Masamune Shirow, serialized in Kodansha's \"Young Magazine Pirate Edition\" from 1989 to 1991. Unlike \"S.A.C.\", where in a similar situation Batou spares the life of an ex-C.I.A. operative, Batou makes good on his threat and personally terminates Koil. His appearance and style of dress vary considerably over the series' run.\n\nIn \"Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface\", Batou makes only a cameo appearance and is hardly recognizable. His head is shaved, and he is dressed in a simple black outfit, though his sense of humor remains intact. During a psychic monitoring of the virtual contact between the main character of the manga and another entity on the net, the psychic states, \"Something of substance, something fruitful has passed between them,\" to which Batou remarks, \"A persimmon maybe?\" This prompts Chief Aramaki to issue an ultimatum: \"If you can't be serious you can leave the room.\" He also asks to link with the psychic when she suffers a similar experience to Motoko's contact with the Puppet Master, but his request is denied.\n\nThe portrayal of Batou in Mamoru Oshii's films is very different from the depiction in the anime series. \"Ghost in the Shell\" and \"\" depict a Batou who is much more subdued, even to the point of brusqueness. His appearance consists of a white crew-cut (similar to the manga) in the first film, while in the second film he has a short ponytail. Batou is voiced by Akio Ōtsuka in Japanese and Richard Epcar in English in all \"Ghost in the Shell\" media with the exception of \"The Laughing Man\" and \"Individual Eleven\" OVAs where he is voiced by David Kaye in English, and \"\", where he is voiced by Kenichirou Matsuda and Christopher Sabat respectively.\n\nBatou is the central character of \"Innocence\", which centers around his personal life after the disappearance of Major Motoko Kusanagi at the end of the first film. Oshii has commented that the investigation is really secondary to the plot. What is most notable about Batou's emotion in \"Innocence\" is his lack thereof; for the most part he expresses nothing whatsoever. The commentary on the \"Innocence\" DVD touches on the fact that it is Batou's lone companion, a Basset Hound named Gabriel, that express almost all of the emotion in the entire film. When Batou is required to leave in order to continue his investigation, Gabriel is left in the care of Togusa and his family. Ishikawa, Batou's senior, chides him for keeping such a high-maintenance dog since he is a single man in a dangerous line of work. The film strongly suggests that Batou harbors romantic feelings for the Major; however, no definitive statement of his feelings is ever made.\n\nAfter shooting his own right arm as a result of brain-hacking, Batou is fitted with a new DNA-matched cybernetic arm with a shotgun hidden inside. He is depicted as being tougher than in the other \"Ghost in the Shell\" incarnations, when he is seen to shoot two live grenades and survive the blast, and withstand a substantial leap down the shaft of the Locus Solus factory ship. In both films, Batou carries a gun dubbed a \"Jericho 942,\" based on the real Jericho 941 made by IMI but chambered for .50AE. In \"Innocence\", he is also seen with a compact S&W pistol and a small semiautomatic shotgun. The \"Innocence\" prequel novel, \"After the Long Goodbye,\" notes that Batou's S&W pistol is chambered for the .40 S&W cartridge.\n\nPilou Asbæk portrays Batou in the 2017 live action film. \"The manga is very philosophical, very weird, very spiritual,\" said Asbæk. \"So I knew that my job with Batou was to bring in a little bit of heart and soul into this futuristic sci-fi world.\" Asbæk had a hard time understanding his character until he looked back at the \"Ghost in the Shell\" source material. \"I didn’t have any idea what to do with the character and then I looked at the manga again, and I saw two things. I saw he likes beer, and he likes pizza. And if you know me for five minutes, that’s 80 percent of my personality!\" he said. The novelization of the film describes Batou as a Scandinavian.\n\nIn \"\", Batou's personality closely resembles his manga counterpart. He is depicted as an outgoing jokester, but with a quick temper. Unlike the Major, Batou often expresses his anger at injustice and cruelty quite openly. He is sometimes shown to be impatient with Section 9's rookies, such as Togusa. At times, Batou acts as a voice of reason and displays great concern for the Major, and she in turn admits that she can confide in him. Like Oshii's films, the series suggests romantic tension between the Major and Batou. The film \"\" more openly addresses this tension, when Batou admits that he'd been covering up the Major's involvement in any cases prior to the Puppeteer case. The movie closes with Batou putting his arm around the Major, although whether or not this is foretelling of any relationship between the two is left ambiguous.\n\nBatou had served in a military special forces unit and often states that he was a Ranger-trained soldier with the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force (JGSDF) before entering Section 9. Despite the fact that his cybernetic body has little to gain from exercise, Batou often lifts weights and jogs. He is shown to have an affinity for martial arts and is widely regarded as nearly the best hand-to-hand combatant in Section 9, second only to the Major. He once idolized a famous boxer, Zaitsev, with whom he later spars while on an undercover mission.\n\nBatou is the favorite superior of the Tachikomas because he regularly showers them with care and affection; in episode 2.15, it also is apparent that he shares a physical resemblance with their chief programmer. He has even dubbed one unit as his \"personal\" Tachikoma, refusing to operate any other and treating it with organic oil, both habits which culminate in problems. Later in the series, the Tachikomas' AI starts to develop rapidly, which is attributed to a mutation in a protein chip caused by Batou's oil. Also, since Batou treats them as individuals as opposed to interchangeable units, they begin to view themselves as such, which contributes to the development of their AI.\n\nBatou is often seen driving a yellow Lancia Stratos coupe, a rare Italian car from the 1970s. He is shown to be very protective of the car and is hesitant to allow others to drive it. Togusa refers to Batou's love of the car as a comeback after Batou chides him for using a revolver instead of a more modern weapon. In \"Solid State Society\", Batou drives a yellow Ford GT with black racing stripes. When the Major notices the new vehicle, she comments to Batou that \"his tastes had changed.\"\n"}

It is a burial custom that is particularly associated with high status women during the early Anglo-Saxon period (7th century), although excavated examples of bed burials are comparatively rare.\n\nA number of early Anglo-Saxon bed burials, almost all dating to the 7th century, have been found in England, predominantly in the southern counties of Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Wiltshire, but single examples have also been found in Derbyshire and North Yorkshire. The beds used in these burials were made of wood, and although none have been fully preserved, their presence can be inferred from the presence of iron fixtures and fittings, such as nails, cleats, grommets, brackets, headboard mounts and railings, that outline the rectangular shape of the bed in the grave. However, in some cases it is not clear whether the iron fixtures found in a grave come from a bed or a coffin.\n\nThe majority of the Anglo-Saxon bed burials are for young women, and many of the burials include items of jewellery and other grave goods that indicate that the dead person must have been wealthy and of high status during life. The high quality of the gold jewellery found in the bed burial at Loftus in Yorkshire suggests that the occupant of the grave may have been a princess. On the other hand, some of the young women buried on their beds have pectoral crosses or other Christian emblems buried with them (Ixworth, Roundway Down, Swallowcliffe Down, Trumpington), which has suggested the possibility that they may have been abbesses, who in the early Anglo-Saxon period were recruited from noble families.\n\nIn addition to laying the deceased on a bed, some of the bed burials exhibit other features that mark them out as special, and relate them to ship burials, such as the bed being placed in a chamber (Coddenham, Swallowcliffe Down), or a barrow being raised above the grave (Lapwing Hill, Swallowcliffe Down). In at least two sites (Loftus and Trumpington), a \"grubenhaus\" (sunken floored building) has been excavated close to the bed burial, and it is possible that the deceased was laid out in the \"grubenhaus\" before burial so that mourners could pay their respects to her.\n\nThe complex and elaborate funeral practices that must have been associated with a bed burial have been well described by archaeologist Howard Williams:\n\nInterring the deceased on a bed suggests that sleep was seen as a metaphor for death. Furthermore, the Old English word \"leger\" (modern English \"lair\"), literally meaning a \"place where one lies\", was used to refer to both beds and graves in Old English literature, which emphasizes the symbolic equivalence of the bed and the grave.\n\nAbout a dozen Anglo-Saxon bed burials, as well as several possible bed burials, have been excavated from the 19th century onwards, as listed in the table below.\n\nIn several Viking ship burials from Norway and Sweden, including the Oseberg ship burial (dated to 834) and Gokstad ship burial (dated to the late 9th century), the deceased had been laid out on beds. However, true bed burials, in which the bed is buried directly in the ground are not known.\n\n\n\n"}

Her death was described as a \"murder\" by the French presidency and it marked the first death of a Western journalist in the conflict.\n\nAfter completing her secondary education in Collège Saint-Martin in Angers, Lepage went on to study journalism in Southampton Solent University, during which she completed an Erasmus year in Utrecht's University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands.\n\nShe later specialized in photojournalism and worked independently in Africa, most notably in Egypt, South Sudan and the Central African Republic. After finishing her degree in Southampton, she moved and based herself in South Sudan's capital Juba in July 2012, a year and a half before arriving to Bangui (CAR's capital) where she spent the last few months of her life. She opened up about her interests in conflicts and photojournalism in an interview a year before her death, where she was asked about her top moments of her career to date and she responded, \"Not sure I can talk about my 'career' just yet, I’m still just getting started! I find it amazing to be able to travel probably to some of the most remote areas, meet wonderful people everywhere and being able to document them.\" She was a well-known photojournalist and her work has been published in several news outlets, such as : New York Times, The Guardian, Le Monde, The Washington Post, Der Spiegel, Libération, Le Nouvel Observateur, La Croix, The Sunday Times, Wall Street Journal, Vice Magazine, Al Jazeera and was widely used by BBC. She had also worked for several non-governmental organizations including : WFP, Enough Project, UNESCO, Internews, Crown Agents, Deloitte, Amnesty International and Médecins sans Frontières.\n\nLepage spoke passionately about the seriousness of the news stories surrounding the Central African Republic conflict that are not covered by the mainstream media: \"I can’t accept that people’s tragedies are silenced simply because no one can make money out of them,\" she said. \"I decided to do it myself, and bring some light to them no matter what.\"\n\nIn November 2013, the UN warned the Central African Republic was at risk of spiraling into genocide, was \"descending into complete chaos\". and France described the country as \"...on the verge of genocide\".\n\nA week before her death, Lepage's last entries on Instagram and Twitter said that she was traveling by motorbike for hours with an anti-balaka militia down routes chosen to avoid checkpoints of African peacekeepers to Amada Gaza about 120 km away from Berbérati, where 150 people had been killed by Séléka rebels since March.\n\nOn May 13, 2014, Lepage's body was found by French peacekeeping troops patrolling in the Bouar region west of the country in a vehicle driven by anti-balaka rebels.

The country performed at least 158 executions in 2015, at least 154 executions in 2016, and at least 146 executions in 2017. \n\nDeath sentences in Saudi Arabia are pronounced almost exclusively based on the system of judicial sentencing discretion (\"tazir\") rather than Sharia-prescribed (\"hudud\") punishments, following the classical principle that \"hudud\" penalties should be avoided if possible. The rise in death sentences during recent decades resulted from a concerted reaction by the government and the courts to a rise of violent crime in the 1970s and paralleled similar developments in the U.S. and China in late 20th century.\n\nSaudi Arabia has a criminal justice system based on a hardline and literal form of Shari'ah law reflecting a particular state-sanctioned interpretation of Islam.\n\nIt is usually carried out publicly by beheading with a sword.\nA recent report by the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights (ESOHR) shows that the number of beheadings in the kingdom during the first quarter of 2018 rose by over 70 percent compared to the same period last year. Occasionally they can be performed by shooting.\n\nA public beheading will typically take place around 9am. The convicted person is walked into the square and kneels in front of the executioner. The executioner uses a sword known as a sulthan to remove the condemned person's head from his or her body at the neck. After the convicted person is pronounced dead, a police official announces the crimes committed by the beheaded alleged criminal and the process is complete. The official might announce the same before the actual execution. This is the most common method of execution in Saudi Arabia because it is specifically called for by Sharia law. Professional executioners behead as many as ten people in a single day.\n\nCrucifixion of the beheaded body is sometimes ordered. For example, in 2009, the \"Saudi Gazette\" reported that \"An Abha court has sentenced the leader of an armed gang to death and three-day crucifixion (public displaying of the beheaded body) and six other gang members to beheading for their role in jewelry store robberies in Asir.\"\n(This practice resembles gibbeting, in which the entire body is displayed).\n\nIn 2003, Muhammad Saad al-Beshi, whom the BBC described as \"Saudi Arabia's leading executioner\", gave a rare interview to Arab News. He described his first execution in 1998: \"The criminal was tied and blindfolded. With one stroke of the sword I severed his head. It rolled metres away...People are amazed how fast [the sword] can separate the head from the body.\" He also said that before an execution he visits the victim's family to seek forgiveness for the criminal, which can lead to the criminal's life being spared. Once an execution goes ahead, his only conversation with the prisoner is to tell him or her to recite the Muslim declaration of belief, the \"Shahada\". \"When they get to the execution square, their strength drains away. Then I read the execution order, and at a signal I cut the prisoner's head off,\" he said.\n\nSaudi law theoretically allows the death penalty for many crimes:\n\n\nMurder is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. If a murderer pays a family of the victim blood money, and the family approves of the choice, the murderer will not be executed. The criminal justice system waits until the family makes a decision on whether the family of the victim will accept blood money or if the family of the victim will choose to have the murderer executed, or to completely forgive the perpetrator.\n\nThe Saudi judiciary can impose the death penalty according to three categories of criminal offence in Sharia law:\n\n\nA conviction requires proof in one of three ways:\n\n\nGiving an oath is taken particularly seriously in a religious society such as Saudi Arabia's, and a refusal to take an oath will be taken as an admission of guilt resulting in conviction.\n\nIn order for an individual to be convicted in a Saudi sharia law court of adultery, he/she must confess to the act four times in front of the court; otherwise four pious male Muslims who witnessed the actual sexual penetration must testify in front of the court. If the witnesses were spying on the defendants or intentionally watched the defendants commit adultery, their uprightness would be called into question and a conviction for adultery would not take place According to the Islamic sharia law, the burden of proof is on the accuser; and if only one of those witnesses retracted his/her testimony then the accused will be acquitted and the remaining witnesses will be prosecuted for perjury Quran 24:4. \n\nThe execution method for adultery for men and women is stoning. If the conviction was established based on confession, a retraction of the confession or the defendant leaving the pit while stoning is taking place results in the penalty being stayed. If the conviction was established based off the testimony of four witnesses, the witnesses must initiate the stoning, and failure to do so results in the execution being stayed. Sandra Mackey, author of \"The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom\", stated in 1987 that in Saudi Arabia, \"unlike the tribal rights of a father to put to death a daughter who has violated her chastity, death sentences under Qur'anic law [for adultery] are extremely rare.\" Mackey explained that \"[c]harges of adultery are never made lightly. Since the penalty is so severe, women are protected from unfounded accusations of sexual misconduct\". During a human rights dialogue with European jurists that took place several years before 1987, a Saudi delegate acknowledged that it is difficult to have a person convicted of adultery. According to Mackey, in a 20-year period ending in 1987, one woman \"is acknowledged to\" have been executed by stoning for adultery.\n\nPrincess Misha'al was shot several times in the head for adultery in 1977.\n\nMuree bin Ali bin Issa al-Asiri, who was found in possession of talismans, was executed in the southern Najran province in June 2012. A Saudi woman, Amina bin Salem Nasser, was executed for being convicted of practising sorcery and witchcraft in December 2011 in the northern province of Jawf, and a Sudanese man (Abdul Hamid Bin Hussain Bin Moustafa al-Fakki) was executed in a car park in Medina for the same reason in September 20, 2011. In 2014, Mohammed bin Bakr al-Alawi was beheaded on 5 August for allegedly practicing black magic sorcery\n\nOn January 2, 2016, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia carried out a mass execution of 47 imprisoned civilians convicted for terrorism in 12 different provinces in the country. Forty-three were beheaded and four were executed by firing squads. Among the 47 people killed was Shia Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr. The execution was the largest carried out in the kingdom since 1980.\n\nThe use of public beheading as the methods of capital punishment and the number of executions have attracted strong international criticism. Several executions, particularly of foreign workers have sparked international outcries.\n\nIn June 2011, Ruyati binti Satubi, an Indonesian maid, was beheaded for killing her employer's wife, reportedly after years of abuse. A video of the execution, posted online, drew extensive criticism.\n\nIn September 2011, a Sudanese migrant worker was beheaded for sorcery, an execution which Amnesty International condemned as \"appalling\".\n\nIn January 2013 a Sri Lankan maid named Rizana Nafeek was beheaded after she was convicted of murdering a child under her care, an occurrence which she attributed to the infant choking. The execution drew international condemnation of the government's practises, and led Sri Lanka to recall its ambassador.\n\nThese are not isolated cases. According to figures by Amnesty International, in 2010 at least 27 migrant workers were executed and, , more than 45 foreign maids were on death row awaiting execution.\n\nIn practice, the death penalty has also been used to sentence political protestors. Ali al-Nimr and Dawoud al-Marhoon were both arrested at the age of 17 in 2012 during Arab Spring protests in the Eastern Province, tortured, forced to confess, and sentenced to decapitation in 2014 and 2015. Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, an independent sheikh critical of the Saudi government and popular among youth and Ali al-Nimr's uncle, was also arrested in 2012 and sentenced to death by the Specialized Criminal Court in 2014 for his role in encouraging political protests. Nimr al-Nimr was executed on January 2, 2016, along with 46 other people, mostly terrorists arrested in the 2000s. From the available sources about Nimr al-Nimr case it seems that Saudi officials use the term \"terrorism\" as cover label for \"thought crimes\" which would be in other countries considered as normal work of opposition politician. In the list of accusations against Nimr al-Nimr there is mention about \"taking up arms against the security forces\" but the details of what exactly happened are missing. It is not clear if some member of Saudi armed forces was injured or killed by Nimr al-Nimr and what happened before the incident.\n\nAlthough there is no exact definition of the term \"terrorism\", the most common meaning is \"to use intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror or fear, in order to achieve a political, religious or ideological aim ... against civilians or non-combatants\". Also most terrorist attacks are characterised by long-term planning so clearly there is subtle difference between common crime (even with lethal consequences) and act of terrorism. Based on previous experience with human rights violation in Saudi Arabia there are strong reasons to take the statements of Saudi officials that Nimr al-Nimr is convicted terrorist with suspicion. This is supported by fact that in the list of offenses done by Nimr al-Nimr most of them are purely \"thought crimes\" like \"disobeying the ruler\", \"inciting sectarian strife\" and \"encouraging, leading and participating in demonstrations\".\n\n"}
{"id": "6019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6019", "title": "Computational chemistry", "text": "Computational chemistry\n\nComputational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses computer simulation to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses methods of theoretical chemistry, incorporated into efficient computer programs, to calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids. It is necessary because, apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion (dihydrogen cation, see references therein for more details), the quantum many-body problem cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form. While computational results normally complement the information obtained by chemical experiments, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical phenomena. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials.\n\nExamples of such properties are structure (i.e., the expected positions of the constituent atoms), absolute and relative (interaction) energies, electronic charge density distributions, dipoles and higher multipole moments, vibrational frequencies, reactivity, or other spectroscopic quantities, and cross sections for collision with other particles.\n\nThe methods used cover both static and dynamic situations. In all cases, the computer time and other resources (such as memory and disk space) increase rapidly with the size of the system being studied. That system can be one molecule, a group of molecules, or a solid. Computational chemistry methods range from very approximate to highly accurate; the latter are usually feasible for small systems only. \"Ab initio\" methods are based entirely on quantum mechanics and basic physical constants. Other methods are called empirical or semi-empirical because they use additional empirical parameters.\n\nBoth \"ab initio\" and semi-empirical approaches involve approximations. These range from simplified forms of the first-principles equations that are easier or faster to solve, to approximations limiting the size of the system (for example, periodic boundary conditions), to fundamental approximations to the underlying equations that are required to achieve any solution to them at all. For example, most \"ab initio\" calculations make the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, which greatly simplifies the underlying Schrödinger equation by assuming that the nuclei remain in place during the calculation. In principle, \"ab initio\" methods eventually converge to the exact solution of the underlying equations as the number of approximations is reduced. In practice, however, it is impossible to eliminate all approximations, and residual error inevitably remains. The goal of computational chemistry is to minimize this residual error while keeping the calculations tractable.\n\nIn some cases, the details of electronic structure are less important than the long-time phase space behavior of molecules. This is the case in conformational studies of proteins and protein-ligand binding thermodynamics. Classical approximations to the potential energy surface are used, as they are computationally less intensive than electronic calculations, to enable longer simulations of molecular dynamics. Furthermore, cheminformatics uses even more empirical (and computationally cheaper) methods like machine learning based on physicochemical properties. One typical problem in cheminformatics is to predict the binding affinity of drug molecules to a given target.\n\nBuilding on the founding discoveries and theories in the history of quantum mechanics, the first theoretical calculations in chemistry were those of Walter Heitler and Fritz London in 1927. The books that were influential in the early development of computational quantum chemistry include Linus Pauling and E. Bright Wilson's 1935 \"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics – with Applications to Chemistry\", Eyring, Walter and Kimball's 1944 \"Quantum Chemistry\", Heitler's 1945 \"Elementary Wave Mechanics – with Applications to Quantum Chemistry\", and later Coulson's 1952 textbook \"Valence\", each of which served as primary references for chemists in the decades to follow.\n\nWith the development of efficient computer technology in the 1940s, the solutions of elaborate wave equations for complex atomic systems began to be a realizable objective. In the early 1950s, the first semi-empirical atomic orbital calculations were performed. Theoretical chemists became extensive users of the early digital computers. One major advance came with the 1951 paper in Reviews of Modern Physics by Clemens C. J. Roothaan in 1951, largely on the \"LCAO MO\" approach (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals Molecular Orbitals), for many years the second-most cited paper in that journal. A very detailed account of such use in the United Kingdom is given by Smith and Sutcliffe. The first \"ab initio\" Hartree–Fock method calculations on diatomic molecules were performed in 1956 at MIT, using a basis set of Slater orbitals. For diatomic molecules, a systematic study using a minimum basis set and the first calculation with a larger basis set were published by Ransil and Nesbet respectively in 1960. The first polyatomic calculations using Gaussian orbitals were performed in the late 1950s. The first configuration interaction calculations were performed in Cambridge on the EDSAC computer in the 1950s using Gaussian orbitals by Boys and coworkers. By 1971, when a bibliography of \"ab initio\" calculations was published, the largest molecules included were naphthalene and azulene. Abstracts of many earlier developments in \"ab initio\" theory have been published by Schaefer.\n\nIn 1964, Hückel method calculations (using a simple linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method to determine electron energies of molecular orbitals of π electrons in conjugated hydrocarbon systems) of molecules, ranging in complexity from butadiene and benzene to ovalene, were generated on computers at Berkeley and Oxford. These empirical methods were replaced in the 1960s by semi-empirical methods such as CNDO.\n\nIn the early 1970s, efficient \"ab initio\" computer programs such as ATMOL, Gaussian, IBMOL, and POLYAYTOM, began to be used to speed \"ab initio\" calculations of molecular orbitals. Of these four programs, only Gaussian, now vastly expanded, is still in use, but many other programs are now in use. At the same time, the methods of molecular mechanics, such as MM2 force field, were developed, primarily by Norman Allinger.\n\nOne of the first mentions of the term \"computational chemistry\" can be found in the 1970 book \"Computers and Their Role in the Physical Sciences\" by Sidney Fernbach and Abraham Haskell Taub, where they state \"It seems, therefore, that 'computational chemistry' can finally be more and more of a reality.\" During the 1970s, widely different methods began to be seen as part of a new emerging discipline of \"computational chemistry\". The \"Journal of Computational Chemistry\" was first published in 1980.\n\nComputational chemistry has featured in several Nobel Prize awards, most notably in 1998 and 2013. Walter Kohn, \"for his development of the density-functional theory\", and John Pople, \"for his development of computational methods in quantum chemistry\", received the 1998 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt and Arieh Warshel received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for \"the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems\".\n\nThe term \"theoretical chemistry\" may be defined as a mathematical description of chemistry, whereas \"computational chemistry\" is usually used when a mathematical method is sufficiently well developed that it can be automated for implementation on a computer. In theoretical chemistry, chemists, physicists, and mathematicians develop algorithms and computer programs to predict atomic and molecular properties and reaction paths for chemical reactions. Computational chemists, in contrast, may simply apply existing computer programs and methodologies to specific chemical questions.\n\nComputational chemistry has two different aspects:\n\nThus, computational chemistry can assist the experimental chemist or it can challenge the experimental chemist to find entirely new chemical objects.\n\nSeveral major areas may be distinguished within computational chemistry:\n\nThe words \"exact\" and \"perfect\" do not apply here, as very few aspects of chemistry can be computed exactly. However, almost every aspect of chemistry can be described in a qualitative or approximate quantitative computational scheme.\n\nMolecules consist of nuclei and electrons, so the methods of quantum mechanics apply. Computational chemists often attempt to solve the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation, with relativistic corrections added, although some progress has been made in solving the fully relativistic Dirac equation. In principle, it is possible to solve the Schrödinger equation in either its time-dependent or time-independent form, as appropriate for the problem in hand; in practice, this is not possible except for very small systems. Therefore, a great number of approximate methods strive to achieve the best trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.\n\nAccuracy can always be improved with greater computational cost. Significant errors can present themselves in ab initio models comprising many electrons, due to the computational cost of full relativistic-inclusive methods. This complicates the study of molecules interacting with high atomic mass unit atoms, such as transitional metals and their catalytic properties. Present algorithms in computational chemistry can routinely calculate the properties of small molecules that contain up to about 40 electrons with errors for energies less than a few kJ/mol. For geometries, bond lengths can be predicted within a few picometres and bond angles within 0.5 degrees. The treatment of larger molecules that contain a few dozen atoms is computationally tractable by more approximate methods such as density functional theory (DFT).\n\nThere is some dispute within the field whether or not the latter methods are sufficient to describe complex chemical reactions, such as those in biochemistry. Large molecules can be studied by semi-empirical approximate methods. Even larger molecules are treated by classical mechanics methods that use what are called molecular mechanics (MM). In QM-MM methods, small parts of large complexes are treated quantum mechanically (QM), and the remainder is treated approximately (MM).\n\nOne molecular formula can represent more than one molecular isomer: a set of isomers. Each isomer is a local minimum on the energy surface (called the potential energy surface) created from the total energy (i.e., the electronic energy, plus the repulsion energy between the nuclei) as a function of the coordinates of all the nuclei. A stationary point is a geometry such that the derivative of the energy with respect to all displacements of the nuclei is zero. A local (energy) minimum is a stationary point where all such displacements lead to an increase in energy. The local minimum that is lowest is called the global minimum and corresponds to the most stable isomer. If there is one particular coordinate change that leads to a decrease in the total energy in both directions, the stationary point is a transition structure and the coordinate is the reaction coordinate. This process of determining stationary points is called geometry optimization.\n\nThe determination of molecular structure by geometry optimization became routine only after efficient methods for calculating the first derivatives of the energy with respect to all atomic coordinates became available. Evaluation of the related second derivatives allows the prediction of vibrational frequencies if harmonic motion is estimated. More importantly, it allows for the characterization of stationary points. The frequencies are related to the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, which contains second derivatives. If the eigenvalues are all positive, then the frequencies are all real and the stationary point is a local minimum. If one eigenvalue is negative (i.e., an imaginary frequency), then the stationary point is a transition structure. If more than one eigenvalue is negative, then the stationary point is a more complex one, and is usually of little interest. When one of these is found, it is necessary to move the search away from it if the experimenter is looking solely for local minima and transition structures.\n\nThe total energy is determined by approximate solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, usually with no relativistic terms included, and by making use of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, which allows for the separation of electronic and nuclear motions, thereby simplifying the Schrödinger equation. This leads to the evaluation of the total energy as a sum of the electronic energy at fixed nuclei positions and the repulsion energy of the nuclei. A notable exception are certain approaches called direct quantum chemistry, which treat electrons and nuclei on a common footing. Density functional methods and semi-empirical methods are variants on the major theme. For very large systems, the relative total energies can be compared using molecular mechanics. The ways of determining the total energy to predict molecular structures are:\n\nThe programs used in computational chemistry are based on many different quantum-chemical methods that solve the molecular Schrödinger equation associated with the molecular Hamiltonian. Methods that do not include any empirical or semi-empirical parameters in their equations – being derived directly from theoretical principles, with no inclusion of experimental data – are called \"ab initio methods\". This does not imply that the solution is an exact one; they are all approximate quantum mechanical calculations. It means that a particular approximation is rigorously defined on first principles (quantum theory) and then solved within an error margin that is qualitatively known beforehand. If numerical iterative methods must be used, the aim is to iterate until full machine accuracy is obtained (the best that is possible with a finite word length on the computer, and within the mathematical and/or physical approximations made).\n\nThe simplest type of \"ab initio\" electronic structure calculation is the Hartree–Fock method (HF), an extension of molecular orbital theory, in which the correlated electron-electron repulsion is not specifically taken into account; only its average effect is included in the calculation. As the basis set size is increased, the energy and wave function tend towards a limit called the Hartree–Fock limit. Many types of calculations (termed post-Hartree–Fock methods) begin with a Hartree–Fock calculation and subsequently correct for electron-electron repulsion, referred to also as electronic correlation. As these methods are pushed to the limit, they approach the exact solution of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. To obtain exact agreement with experiment, it is necessary to include relativistic and spin orbit terms, both of which are far more important for heavy atoms. In all of these approaches, along with choice of method, it is necessary to choose a basis set. This is a set of functions, usually centered on the different atoms in the molecule, which are used to expand the molecular orbitals with the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) molecular orbital method ansatz. Ab initio methods need to define a level of theory (the method) and a basis set.\n\nThe Hartree–Fock wave function is a single configuration or determinant. In some cases, particularly for bond breaking processes, this is inadequate, and several configurations must be used. Here, the coefficients of the configurations, and of the basis functions, are optimized together.\n\nThe total molecular energy can be evaluated as a function of the molecular geometry; in other words, the potential energy surface. Such a surface can be used for reaction dynamics. The stationary points of the surface lead to predictions of different isomers and the transition structures for conversion between isomers, but these can be determined without a full knowledge of the complete surface.\n\nA particularly important objective, called computational thermochemistry, is to calculate thermochemical quantities such as the enthalpy of formation to chemical accuracy. Chemical accuracy is the accuracy required to make realistic chemical predictions and is generally considered to be 1 kcal/mol or 4 kJ/mol. To reach that accuracy in an economic way it is necessary to use a series of post-Hartree–Fock methods and combine the results. These methods are called quantum chemistry composite methods.\n\nDensity functional theory (DFT) methods are often considered to be \"ab initio methods\" for determining the molecular electronic structure, even though many of the most common functionals use parameters derived from empirical data, or from more complex calculations. In DFT, the total energy is expressed in terms of the total one-electron density rather than the wave function. In this type of calculation, there is an approximate Hamiltonian and an approximate expression for the total electron density. DFT methods can be very accurate for little computational cost. Some methods combine the density functional exchange functional with the Hartree–Fock exchange term and are termed hybrid functional methods.\n\nSemi-empirical quantum chemistry methods are based on the Hartree–Fock method formalism, but make many approximations and obtain some parameters from empirical data. They were very important in computational chemistry from the 60s to the 90s, especially for treating large molecules where the full Hartree–Fock method without the approximations were too costly. The use of empirical parameters appears to allow some inclusion of correlation effects into the methods.\n\nPrimitive semi-empirical methods were designed even before, where the two-electron part of the Hamiltonian is not explicitly included. For π-electron systems, this was the Hückel method proposed by Erich Hückel, and for all valence electron systems, the extended Hückel method proposed by Roald Hoffmann. Sometimes, Hückel methods are referred to as \"completely emprirical\" because they do not derive from a Hamiltonian.Yet, the term \"empirical methods\", or \"empirical force fields\" is usually used to describe Molecular Mechanics.\n\nIn many cases, large molecular systems can be modeled successfully while avoiding quantum mechanical calculations entirely. Molecular mechanics simulations, for example, use one classical expression for the energy of a compound, for instance the harmonic oscillator. All constants appearing in the equations must be obtained beforehand from experimental data or \"ab initio\" calculations.\n\nThe database of compounds used for parameterization, i.e., the resulting set of parameters and functions is called the force field, is crucial to the success of molecular mechanics calculations. A force field parameterized against a specific class of molecules, for instance proteins, would be expected to only have any relevance when describing other molecules of the same class.\n\nThese methods can be applied to proteins and other large biological molecules, and allow studies of the approach and interaction (docking) of potential drug molecules.\n\nComputational chemical methods can be applied to solid state physics problems. The electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a band structure, which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the Brillouin zone. Ab initio and semi-empirical calculations yield orbital energies; therefore, they can be applied to band structure calculations. Since it is time-consuming to calculate the energy for a molecule, it is even more time-consuming to calculate them for the entire list of points in the Brillouin zone.\n\nOnce the electronic and nuclear variables are separated (within the Born–Oppenheimer representation), in the time-dependent approach, the wave packet corresponding to the nuclear degrees of freedom is propagated via the time evolution operator (physics) associated to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (for the full molecular Hamiltonian). In the complementary energy-dependent approach, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is solved using the scattering theory formalism. The potential representing the interatomic interaction is given by the potential energy surfaces. In general, the potential energy surfaces are coupled via the vibronic coupling terms.\n\nThe most popular methods for propagating the wave packet associated to the molecular geometry are:\n\nMolecular dynamics (MD) use either quantum mechanics, molecular mechanics or a mixture of both to calculate forces which are then used to solve Newton's laws of motion to examine the time-dependent behaviour of systems. The result of a molecular dynamics simulation is a trajectory that describes how the position and velocity of particles varies with time.\n\nQM/MM is a hybrid method that attempts to combine the accuracy of quantum mechanics with the speed of molecular mechanics. It is useful for simulating very large molecules such as enzymes.\n\nThe atoms in molecules (QTAIM) model of Richard Bader was developed to effectively link the quantum mechanical model of a molecule, as an electronic wavefunction, to chemically useful concepts such as atoms in molecules, functional groups, bonding, the theory of Lewis pairs, and the valence bond model. Bader has demonstrated that these empirically useful chemistry concepts can be related to the topology of the observable charge density distribution, whether measured or calculated from a quantum mechanical wavefunction. QTAIM analysis of molecular wavefunctions is implemented, for example, in the AIMAll software package.\n\nMany self-sufficient exist. Some include many methods covering a wide range, while others concentrate on a very specific range or even on one method. Details of most of them can be found in:\n\n\n\n"}

He served at the central military hospital of the Ministry of Defence.\n\nIn the evening of June 17, 2012 a group of doctors, Vahe Avetyan among them, visited the restaurant. Avetyan was in sport clothes. The quarrel occurred on about 11:00 PM between Avetyan and a waiter because of Vahe's clothing. The fighting began after he hit the waiter. The medical servers Vahe Avetyan, Edgar Mikoyan, Arkadi Aghajanyan, Garik Soghomonyan, and Artak Baiadyan were beaten by the employees and security. Vahe Avetyan and Artak Baiadyan were moved to the hospital afterward.

The strategy of shattering or defeating an enemy by eliminating its military and political leadership has long been utilized in warfare.\n\nIn nuclear warfare theory, a decapitation strike is a pre-emptive first strike attack that aims to destabilize an opponent's military and civil leadership structure in the hope that it will severely degrade or destroy its capacity for nuclear retaliation. It is essentially a subset of a counterforce strike but whereas a counterforce strike seeks to destroy weapons directly, a decapitation strike is designed to remove an enemy's ability to use its weapons.\n\nStrategies against decapitation strikes include the following:\n\nA failed decapitation strike carries the risk of immediate, massive retaliation by the targeted opponent. Many countries with nuclear weapons specifically plan to prevent decapitation strikes by employing second-strike capabilities. Such countries may have mobile land-based launch, sea launch, air launch, and underground ballistic missile launch facilities so that a nuclear launch on one area of the country will not totally negate its ability to retaliate.\n\nOther nuclear warfare doctrines explicitly exclude decapitation strikes on the basis that it is better to preserve the adversary's command and control structures so that a single authority remains that is capable of negotiating a surrender or ceasefire. Implementing fail-deadly mechanisms can be a way to deter decapitation strikes and respond to successful decapitation strikes.\n\nDecapitation Strike strategy has been employed in conventional warfare.\n\nAdditionally, the term has been used to describe the assassination of a government's entire leadership group or a nation's royal family.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37436", "title": "Emergence", "text": "Emergence\n\nIn philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence is the condition of an entity having properties its parts do not have, due to interactions among the parts.\n\nEmergence plays a central role in theories of integrative levels and of complex systems. For instance, the phenomenon of \"life\" as studied in biology is an emergent property of chemistry, and psychological phenomena emerge from the neurobiological phenomena of living things.\n\nIn philosophy, theories that emphasize emergent properties have been called emergentism. Almost all accounts of emergentism include a form of epistemic or ontological irreducibility to the lower levels.\n\nIn philosophy, emergence is often understood to be a claim about the etiology of a system's properties. An emergent property of a system, in this context, is one that is not a property of any component of that system, but is still a feature of the system as a whole. Nicolai Hartmann, one of the first modern philosophers to write on emergence, termed this \"categorial novum\" (new category).\n\nThis idea of emergence has been around since at least the time of Aristotle.  John Stuart Mill and Julian Huxley are two of many scientists and philosophers who have written on the concept.\n\nThe term \"emergent\" was coined by philosopher G. H. Lewes, who wrote:\n\nEvery resultant is either a sum or a difference of the co-operant forces; their sum, when their directions are the same – their difference, when their directions are contrary. Further, every resultant is clearly traceable in its components, because these are homogeneous and commensurable. It is otherwise with emergents, when, instead of adding measurable motion to measurable motion, or things of one kind to other individuals of their kind, there is a co-operation of things of unlike kinds. The emergent is unlike its components insofar as these are incommensurable, and it cannot be reduced to their sum or their difference.\n\nEconomist Jeffrey Goldstein provided a current definition of emergence in the journal \"Emergence\". Goldstein initially defined emergence as: \"the arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns and properties during the process of self-organization in complex systems\".\n\nSystems scientist Peter Corning described the qualities of Goldstein's definition in more detail:\n\nThe common characteristics are: (1) radical novelty (features not previously observed in systems); (2) coherence or correlation (meaning integrated wholes that maintain themselves over some period of time); (3) A global or macro \"level\" (i.e. there is some property of \"wholeness\"); (4) it is the product of a dynamical process (it evolves); and (5) it is \"ostensive\" (it can be perceived).\n\nPeter Corning suggests a narrower definition, requiring that the components be unlike in kind (following Lewes), and that they involve division of labor between these components. He also says that living systems (like the game of chess), while emergent, cannot be reduced to underlying laws of emergence:\n\nRules, or laws, have no causal efficacy; they do not in fact “generate” anything. They serve merely to describe regularities and consistent relationships in nature. These patterns may be very illuminating and important, but the underlying causal agencies must be separately specified (though often they are not). But that aside, the game of chess illustrates ... why any laws or rules of emergence and evolution are insufficient. Even in a chess game, you cannot use the rules to predict “history” – i.e., the course of any given game. Indeed, you cannot even reliably predict the next move in a chess game. Why? Because the “system” involves more than the rules of the game. It also includes the players and their unfolding, moment-by-moment decisions among a very large number of available options at each choice point. The game of chess is inescapably historical, even though it is also constrained and shaped by a set of rules, not to mention the laws of physics. Moreover, and this is a key point, the game of chess is also shaped by teleonomic, cybernetic, feedback-driven influences. It is not simply a self-ordered process; it involves an organized, “purposeful” activity.\n\nUsage of the notion \"emergence\" may generally be subdivided into two perspectives, that of \"weak emergence\" and \"strong emergence\". In terms of physical systems, weak emergence is a type of emergence in which the emergent property is amenable to computer simulation. This is opposed to the older notion of strong emergence, in which the emergent property cannot be simulated by a computer.\n\nSome common points between the two notions are that emergence concerns new properties produced as the system grows, which is to say ones which are not shared with its components or prior states. Also, it is assumed that the properties are supervenient rather than metaphysically primitive .\n\nWeak emergence describes new properties arising in systems as a result of the interactions at an elemental level. However, it is stipulated that the properties can be determined only by observing or simulating the system, and not by any process of analysis.\n\nBedau notes that weak emergence is not a universal metaphysical solvent, as the hypothesis that consciousness is weakly emergent would not resolve the traditional philosophical questions about the physicality of consciousness. However, Bedau concludes that adopting this view would provide a precise notion that emergence is involved in consciousness, and second, the notion of weak emergence is metaphysically benign.\n\nStrong emergence describes the direct causal action of a high-level system upon its components; qualities produced this way are irreducible to the system's constituent parts . The whole is other than the sum of its parts. An example from physics of such emergence is water, being seemingly unpredictable even after an exhaustive study of the properties of its constituent atoms of hydrogen and oxygen. It follows then that no simulation of the system can exist, for such a simulation would itself constitute a reduction of the system to its constituent parts.\n\nHowever, \"the debate about whether or not the whole can be predicted from the properties of the parts misses the point. Wholes produce unique combined effects, but many of these effects may be co-determined by the context and the interactions between the whole and its environment(s)\" . In accordance with his Synergism Hypothesis, Corning also stated, \"It is the synergistic effects produced by wholes that are the very cause of the evolution of complexity in nature.\" Novelist Arthur Koestler used the metaphor of Janus (a symbol of the unity underlying complements like open/shut, peace/war) to illustrate how the two perspectives (strong vs. weak or holistic vs. reductionistic) should be treated as non-exclusive, and should work together to address the issues of emergence. Further,\n\nThe ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin difficulties of scale and complexity. At each level of complexity entirely new properties appear. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied chemistry. We can now see that the whole becomes not merely more, but very different from the sum of its parts.\n\nThe plausibility of strong emergence is questioned by some as contravening our usual understanding of physics. Mark A. Bedau observes:\n\nAlthough strong emergence is logically possible, it is uncomfortably like magic. How does an irreducible but supervenient downward causal power arise, since by definition it cannot be due to the aggregation of the micro-level potentialities? Such causal powers would be quite unlike anything within our scientific ken. This not only indicates how they will discomfort reasonable forms of materialism. Their mysteriousness will only heighten the traditional worry that emergence entails illegitimately getting something from nothing.\n\nStrong emergence can be criticized for being causally overdetermined. The canonical example concerns emergent mental states (M and M∗) that supervene on physical states (P and P∗) respectively. Let M and M∗ be emergent properties. Let M∗ supervene on base property P∗. What happens when M causes M∗? Jaegwon Kim says:\n\nIn our schematic example above, we concluded that M causes M∗ by causing P∗. So M causes P∗. Now, M, as an emergent, must itself have an emergence base property, say P. Now we face a critical question: if an emergent, M, emerges from basal condition P, why cannot P displace M as a cause of any putative effect of M? Why cannot P do all the work in explaining why any alleged effect of M occurred? If causation is understood as nomological (law-based) sufficiency, P, as M’s emergence base, is nomologically sufficient for it, and M, as P∗’s cause, is nomologically sufficient for P∗. It follows that P is nomologically sufficient for P∗ and hence qualifies as its cause…If M is somehow retained as a cause, we are faced with the highly implausible consequence that every case of downward causation involves overdetermination (since P remains a cause of P∗ as well). Moreover, this goes against the spirit of emergentism in any case: emergents are supposed to make distinctive and novel causal contributions.\n\nIf M is the cause of M∗, then M∗ is overdetermined because M∗ can also be thought of as being determined by P. One escape route that a strong emergentist could take would be to deny downward causation. However, this would remove the proposed reason that emergent mental states must supervene on physical states, which in turn would call physicalism into question, and thus be unpalatable for some philosophers and physicists.\n\nMeanwhile, others have worked towards developing analytical evidence of strong emergence. In 2009, Gu et al. presented a class of physical systems that exhibits non-computable macroscopic properties. More precisely, if one could compute certain macroscopic properties of these systems from the microscopic description of these systems, then one would be able to solve computational problems known to be undecidable in computer science. They concluded that\n\nAlthough macroscopic concepts are essential for understanding our world, much of fundamental physics has been devoted to the search for a `theory of everything', a set of equations that perfectly describe the behavior of all fundamental particles. The view that this is the goal of science rests in part on the rationale that such a theory would allow us to derive the behavior of all macroscopic concepts, at least in principle. The evidence we have presented suggests that this view may be overly optimistic. A `theory of everything' is one of many components necessary for complete understanding of the universe, but is not necessarily the only one. The development of macroscopic laws from first principles may involve more than just systematic logic, and could require conjectures suggested by experiments, simulations or insight.\n\nEmergent structures are patterns that emerge via collective actions of many individual entities. To explain such patterns, one might conclude, per Aristotle, that emergent structures are other than the sum of their parts on the assumption that the emergent order will not arise if the various parts simply interact independently of one another. However, there are those who disagree. According to this argument, the interaction of each part with its immediate surroundings causes a complex chain of processes that can lead to order in some form. In fact, some systems in nature are observed to exhibit emergence based upon the interactions of autonomous parts, and some others exhibit emergence that at least at present cannot be reduced in this way. In particular renormalization are methods in theoretical physics which enables scientists to study systems that are not tractable as the combination of their parts.\n\nThe properties of complexity and organization of any system are considered by Crutchfield to be subjective qualities determined by the observer.\n\nDefining structure and detecting the emergence of complexity in nature are inherently subjective, though essential, scientific activities. Despite the difficulties, these problems can be analysed in terms of how model-building observers infer from measurements the computational capabilities embedded in non-linear processes. An observer’s notion of what is ordered, what is random, and what is complex in its environment depends directly on its computational resources: the amount of raw measurement data, of memory, and of time available for estimation and inference. The discovery of structure in an environment depends more critically and subtly, though, on how those resources are organized. The descriptive power of the observer’s chosen (or implicit) computational model class, for example, can be an overwhelming determinant in finding regularity in data.\n\nOn the other hand, Peter Corning argues \"Must the synergies be perceived/observed in order to qualify as emergent effects, as some theorists claim? Most emphatically not. The synergies associated with emergence are real and measurable, even if nobody is there to observe them.\"\n\nIn religion, emergence grounds expressions of religious naturalism and syntheism in which a sense of the sacred is perceived in the workings of entirely naturalistic processes by which more complex forms arise or evolve from simpler forms. Examples are detailed in \"The Sacred Emergence of Nature\" by Ursula Goodenough & Terrence Deacon and \"Beyond Reductionism: Reinventing the Sacred\" by Stuart Kauffman, both from 2006, and in \"Syntheism – Creating God in The Internet Age\" by Alexander Bard & Jan Söderqvist from 2014. An early argument (1904–05) for the emergence of social formations, in part stemming from religion, can be found in Max Weber's most famous work, \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\".\n\nIn art, emergence is used to explore the origins of novelty, creativity, and authorship. Some art/literary theorists (Wheeler, 2006; Alexander, 2011) have proposed alternatives to postmodern understandings of \"authorship\" using the complexity sciences and emergence theory. They contend that artistic selfhood and meaning are emergent, relatively objective phenomena. Michael J. Pearce has used emergence to describe the experience of works of art in relation to contemporary neuroscience. Practicing artist Leonel Moura, in turn, attrbutes to his \"artbots\" a real, if nonetheless rudimentary, creativity based on emergent principles.\n\nIn international development, concepts of emergence have been used within a theory of social change termed SEED-SCALE to show how standard principles interact to bring forward socio-economic development fitted to cultural values, community economics, and natural environment (local solutions emerging from the larger socio-econo-biosphere). These principles can be implemented utilizing a sequence of standardized tasks that self-assemble in individually specific ways utilizing recursive evaluative criteria.\n\nIn postcolonial studies, the term \"Emerging Literature\" refers to a contemporary body of texts that is gaining momentum in the global literary landscape (v. esp.: J.M. Grassin, ed. \"Emerging Literatures\", Bern, Berlin, etc. : Peter Lang, 1996). By opposition, \"emergent literature\" is rather a concept used in the theory of literature.\n\nAn emergent behavior or emergent property can appear when a number of simple entities (agents) operate in an environment, forming more complex behaviors as a collective. If emergence happens over disparate size scales, then the reason is usually a causal relation across different scales. In other words, there is often a form of top-down feedback in systems with emergent properties. The processes causing emergent properties may occur in either the observed or observing system, and are commonly identifiable by their patterns of accumulating change, generally called 'growth'. Emergent behaviours can occur because of intricate causal relations across different scales and feedback, known as interconnectivity. The emergent property itself may be either very predictable or unpredictable and unprecedented, and represent a new level of the system's evolution. The complex behaviour or properties are not a property of any single such entity, nor can they easily be predicted or deduced from behaviour in the lower-level entities, and might in fact be irreducible to such behavior. The shape and behaviour of a flock of birds or school of fish are good examples of emergent properties.\n\nOne reason emergent behaviour is hard to predict is that the number of interactions between a system components increases exponentially with the number of components, thus allowing for many new and subtle types of behaviour to emerge. Emergence is often a product of particular patterns of interaction. Negative feedback introduces constraints that serve to fix structures or behaviours. In contrast, positive feedback promotes change, allowing local variations to grow into global patterns. Another way in which interactions leads to emergent properties is dual-phase evolution. This occurs where interactions are applied intermittently, leading to two phases: one in which patterns form or grow, the other in which they are refined or removed.\n\nOn the other hand, merely having a large number of interactions is not enough by itself to guarantee emergent behaviour; many of the interactions may be negligible or irrelevant, or may cancel each other out. In some cases, a large number of interactions can in fact hinder the emergence of interesting behaviour, by creating a lot of \"noise\" to drown out any emerging \"signal\"; the emergent behaviour may need to be temporarily isolated from other interactions before it reaches enough critical mass to self-support. Thus it is not just the sheer number of connections between components which encourages emergence; it is also how these connections are organised. A hierarchical organisation is one example that can generate emergent behaviour (a bureaucracy may behave in a way quite different from that of the individual humans in that bureaucracy); but emergent behaviour can also arise from more decentralized organisational structures, such as a marketplace. In some cases, the system has to reach a combined threshold of diversity, organisation, and connectivity before emergent behaviour appears.\n\nUnintended consequences and side effects are closely related to emergent properties. Luc Steels writes: \"A component has a particular functionality but this is not recognizable as a subfunction of the global functionality. Instead a component implements a behaviour whose side effect contributes to the global functionality [...] Each behaviour has a side effect and the sum of the side effects gives the desired functionality\". In other words, the global or macroscopic functionality of a system with \"emergent functionality\" is the sum of all \"side effects\", of all emergent properties and functionalities.\n\nSystems with emergent properties or emergent structures may appear to defy entropic principles and the second law of thermodynamics, because they form and increase order despite the lack of command and central control. This is possible because open systems can extract information and order out of the environment.\n\nEmergence helps to explain why the fallacy of division is a fallacy.\n\nEmergent structures can be found in many natural phenomena, from the physical to the biological domain. For example, the shape of weather phenomena such as hurricanes are emergent structures. The development and growth of complex, orderly crystals, as driven by the random motion of water molecules within a conducive natural environment, is another example of an emergent process, where randomness can give rise to complex and deeply attractive, orderly structures.\n\nIt is useful to distinguish three forms of emergent structures. A \"first-order\" emergent structure occurs as a result of shape interactions (for example, hydrogen bonds in water molecules lead to surface tension). A \"second-order\" emergent structure involves shape interactions played out sequentially over time (for example, changing atmospheric conditions as a snowflake falls to the ground build upon and alter its form). Finally, a \"third-order\" emergent structure is a consequence of shape, time, and heritable instructions. For example, an organism's genetic code affects the form of the organism's systems in space and time.\n\nIn physics, emergence is used to describe a property, law, or phenomenon which occurs at macroscopic scales (in space or time) but not at microscopic scales, despite the fact that a macroscopic system can be viewed as a very large ensemble of microscopic systems.\n\nAn emergent property need not be more complicated than the underlying non-emergent properties which generate it. For instance, the laws of thermodynamics are remarkably simple, even if the laws which govern the interactions between component particles are complex. The term emergence in physics is thus used not to signify complexity, but rather to distinguish which laws and concepts apply to macroscopic scales, and which ones apply to microscopic scales. \n\nHowever, another, perhaps more broadly applicable way to conceive of the emergent divide does involve a dose of complexity insofar as the computational feasibility of going from the microscopic to the macroscopic property tells the 'strength' of the emergence. This is better understood given the following definition of emergence that comes from physics:\n\n\"An emergent behavior of a physical system is a qualitative property that can only occur in the limit that the number of microscopic constituents tends to infinity.\"\n\nSince there are no actually infinite systems in the real world, there is no obvious naturally occurring notion of a hard separation between the properties of the constituents of a system and those of the emergent whole. As discussed below, classical mechanics is thought to be emergent from quantum mechanics, though in principal, quantum dynamics fully describes everything happening at a classical level. However, it would take a computer larger then the size of the universe with more computing time then life time of the universe to describe the motion of a falling apple in terms of the locations of its electrons ; thus we can take this to be a \"strong\" emergent divide. \n\nSome examples include:\n\nTemperature is sometimes used as an example of an emergent macroscopic behaviour. In classical dynamics, a \"snapshot\" of the instantaneous momenta of a large number of particles at equilibrium is sufficient to find the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom which is proportional to the temperature. For a small number of particles the instantaneous momenta at a given time are not statistically sufficient to determine the temperature of the system. However, using the ergodic hypothesis, the temperature can still be obtained to arbitrary precision by further averaging the momenta over a long enough time.\n\nConvection in a liquid or gas is another example of emergent macroscopic behaviour that makes sense only when considering differentials of temperature. Convection cells, particularly Bénard cells, are an example of a self-organizing system (more specifically, a dissipative system) whose structure is determined both by the constraints of the system and by random perturbations: the possible realizations of the shape and size of the cells depends on the temperature gradient as well as the nature of the fluid and shape of the container, but which configurations are actually realized is due to random perturbations (thus these systems exhibit a form of symmetry breaking).\n\nIn some theories of particle physics, even such basic structures as mass, space, and time are viewed as emergent phenomena, arising from more fundamental concepts such as the Higgs boson or strings. In some interpretations of quantum mechanics, the perception of a deterministic reality, in which all objects have a definite position, momentum, and so forth, is actually an emergent phenomenon, with the true state of matter being described instead by a wavefunction which need not have a single position or momentum.\nMost of the laws of physics themselves as we experience them today appear to have emerged during the course of time making emergence the most fundamental principle in the universe and raising the question of what might be the most fundamental law of physics from which all others emerged. Chemistry can in turn be viewed as an emergent property of the laws of physics. Biology (including biological evolution) can be viewed as an emergent property of the laws of chemistry. Similarly, psychology could be understood as an emergent property of neurobiological laws. Finally, free-market theories understand economy as an emergent feature of psychology.\n\nAccording to Laughlin (2005), for many particle systems, nothing can be calculated exactly from the microscopic equations, and macroscopic systems are characterised by broken symmetry: the symmetry present in the microscopic equations is not present in the macroscopic system, due to phase transitions. As a result, these macroscopic systems are described in their own terminology, and have properties that do not depend on many microscopic details. This does not mean that the microscopic interactions are irrelevant, but simply that you do not see them anymore — you only see a renormalized effect of them. Laughlin is a pragmatic theoretical physicist: if you cannot, possibly ever, calculate the broken symmetry macroscopic properties from the microscopic equations, then what is the point of talking about reducibility?\n\nLife is a major source of complexity, and evolution is the major process behind the varying forms of life. In this view, evolution is the process describing the growth of complexity in the natural world and in speaking of the emergence of complex living beings and life-forms, this view refers therefore to processes of sudden changes in evolution.\n\nLife is thought to have emerged in the early RNA world when RNA chains began to express the basic conditions necessary for natural selection to operate as conceived by Darwin: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. Fitness of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely be a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (in the sense that they were determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities may have been (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type); (2) the capacity to avoid decay; and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations of the RNA replicators (see “Ribozyme”) that, in turn, would be encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences. Competitive success among different replicators would have depended on the relative values of these adaptive capacities.\n\nRegarding causality in evolution Peter Corning observes:\nSynergistic effects of various kinds have played a major causal role in the evolutionary process generally and in the evolution of cooperation and complexity in particular... Natural selection is often portrayed as a “mechanism”, or is personified as a causal agency... In reality, the differential “selection” of a trait, or an adaptation, is a consequence of the functional effects it produces in relation to the survival and reproductive success of a given organism in a given environment. It is these functional effects that are ultimately responsible for the trans-generational continuities and changes in nature.\n\nPer his definition of emergence, Corning also addresses emergence and evolution:\n[In] evolutionary processes, causation is iterative; effects are also causes. And this is equally true of the synergistic effects produced by emergent systems. In other words, emergence itself... has been the underlying cause of the evolution of emergent phenomena in biological evolution; it is the synergies produced by organized systems that are the key.\n\nSwarming is a well-known behaviour in many animal species from marching locusts to schooling fish to flocking birds. Emergent structures are a common strategy found in many animal groups: colonies of ants, mounds built by termites, swarms of bees, shoals/schools of fish, flocks of birds, and herds/packs of mammals.\n\nAn example to consider in detail is an ant colony. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do. Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scent from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and buildup of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety of ant. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behavior and have even demonstrated the ability to solve geometric problems. For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies.\n\nIt appears that environmental factors may play a role in influencing emergence. Research suggests induced emergence of the bee species Macrotera portalis. In this species, the bees emerge in a pattern consistent with rainfall. Specifically, the pattern of emergence is consistent with southwestern deserts' late summer rains and lack of activity in the spring.\n\nA broader example of emergent properties in biology is viewed in the biological organisation of life, ranging from the subatomic level to the entire biosphere. For example, individual atoms can be combined to form molecules such as polypeptide chains, which in turn fold and refold to form proteins, which in turn create even more complex structures. These proteins, assuming their functional status from their spatial conformation, interact together and with other molecules to achieve higher biological functions and eventually create an organism. Another example is how cascade phenotype reactions, as detailed in chaos theory, arise from individual genes mutating respective positioning. At the highest level, all the biological communities in the world form the biosphere, where its human participants form societies, and the complex interactions of meta-social systems such as the stock market.\n\nAmong the considered phenomena in the evolutionary account of life, as a continuous history, marked by stages at which fundamentally new forms have appeared - the origin of sapiens intelligence. The emergence of mind and its evolution is researched and considered as a separate phenomenon in a special system knowledge noogenesis\n\nGroups of human beings, left free to each regulate themselves, tend to produce spontaneous order, rather than the meaningless chaos often feared. This has been observed in society at least since Chuang Tzu in ancient China. A classic traffic roundabout is a good example, with cars moving in and out with such effective organization that some modern cities have begun replacing stoplights at problem intersections with traffic circles , and getting better results. Open-source software and Wiki projects form an even more compelling illustration.\n\nEmergent processes or behaviors can be seen in many other places, such as cities, cabal and market-dominant minority phenomena in economics, organizational phenomena in computer simulations and cellular automata. Whenever there is a multitude of individuals interacting, an order emerges from disorder; a pattern, a decision, a structure, or a change in direction occurs.\n\nThe stock market (or any market for that matter) is an example of emergence on a grand scale. As a whole it precisely regulates the relative security prices of companies across the world, yet it has no leader; when no central planning is in place, there is no one entity which controls the workings of the entire market. Agents, or investors, have knowledge of only a limited number of companies within their portfolio, and must follow the regulatory rules of the market and analyse the transactions individually or in large groupings. Trends and patterns emerge which are studied intensively by technical analysts..\n\nThe World Wide Web is a popular example of a decentralized system exhibiting emergent properties. There is no central organization rationing the number of links, yet the number of links pointing to each page follows a power law in which a few pages are linked to many times and most pages are seldom linked to. A related property of the network of links in the World Wide Web is that almost any pair of pages can be connected to each other through a relatively short chain of links. Although relatively well known now, this property was initially unexpected in an unregulated network. It is shared with many other types of networks called small-world networks.\n\nInternet traffic can also exhibit some seemingly emergent properties. In the congestion control mechanism, TCP flows can become globally synchronized at bottlenecks, simultaneously increasing and then decreasing throughput in coordination. Congestion, widely regarded as a nuisance, is possibly an emergent property of the spreading of bottlenecks across a network in high traffic flows which can be considered as a phase transition [see review of related research in ].\n\nAnother important example of emergence in web-based systems is social bookmarking (also called collaborative tagging). In social bookmarking systems, users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which gives rise to a type of information organisation that emerges from this crowdsourcing process. Recent research which analyzes empirically the complex dynamics of such systems has shown that consensus on stable distributions and a simple form of shared vocabularies does indeed emerge, even in the absence of a central controlled vocabulary. Some believe that this could be because users who contribute tags all use the same language, and they share similar semantic structures underlying the choice of words. The convergence in social tags may therefore be interpreted as the emergence of structures as people who have similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information, a process called semantic imitation.\n\nEmergent structures appear at many different levels of organization or as spontaneous order. Emergent self-organization appears frequently in cities where no planning or zoning entity predetermines the layout of the city. The interdisciplinary study of emergent behaviors is not generally considered a homogeneous field, but divided across its application or problem domains.\n\nArchitects may not design all the pathways of a complex of buildings. Instead they might let usage patterns emerge and then place pavement where pathways have become worn, such as a desire path.\n\nThe on-course action and vehicle progression of the 2007 Urban Challenge could possibly be regarded as an example of cybernetic emergence. Patterns of road use, indeterministic obstacle clearance times, etc. will work together to form a complex emergent pattern that can not be deterministically planned in advance.\n\nThe architectural school of Christopher Alexander takes a deeper approach to emergence, attempting to rewrite the process of urban growth itself in order to affect form, establishing a new methodology of planning and design tied to traditional practices, an Emergent Urbanism. Urban emergence has also been linked to theories of urban complexity and urban evolution.\n\nBuilding ecology is a conceptual framework for understanding architecture and the built environment as the interface between the dynamically interdependent elements of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment. Rather than viewing buildings as inanimate or static objects, building ecologist Hal Levin views them as interfaces or intersecting domains of living and non-living systems. The microbial ecology of the indoor environment is strongly dependent on the building materials, occupants, contents, environmental context and the indoor and outdoor climate. The strong relationship between atmospheric chemistry and indoor air quality and the chemical reactions occurring indoors. The chemicals may be nutrients, neutral or biocides for the microbial organisms. The microbes produce chemicals that affect the building materials and occupant health and well being. Humans manipulate the ventilation, temperature and humidity to achieve comfort with the concomitant effects on the microbes that populate and evolve.\n\nEric Bonabeau's attempt to define emergent phenomena is through traffic: \"traffic jams are actually very complicated and mysterious. On an individual level, each driver is trying to get somewhere and is following (or breaking) certain rules, some legal (the speed limit) and others societal or personal (slow down to let another driver change into your lane). But a traffic jam is a separate and distinct entity that emerges from those individual behaviors. Gridlock on a highway, for example, can travel backward for no apparent reason, even as the cars are moving forward.\" He has also likened emergent phenomena to the analysis of market trends and employee behavior.\n\nComputational emergent phenomena have also been utilized in architectural design processes, for example for formal explorations and experiments in digital materiality.\n\nSome artificially intelligent (AI) computer applications utilize emergent behavior for animation. One example is Boids, which mimics the swarming behavior of birds.\n\nIt has been argued that the structure and regularity of language grammar, or at least language change, is an emergent phenomenon . While each speaker merely tries to reach his or her own communicative goals, he or she uses language in a particular way. If enough speakers behave in that way, language is changed . In a wider sense, the norms of a language, i.e. the linguistic conventions of its speech society, can be seen as a system emerging from long-time participation in communicative problem-solving in various social circumstances .\n\nWithin the field of group facilitation and organization development, there have been a number of new group processes that are designed to maximize emergence and self-organization, by offering a minimal set of effective initial conditions. Examples of these processes include SEED-SCALE, Appreciative Inquiry, Future Search, the World Cafe or Knowledge Cafe, Open Space Technology, and others (Holman, 2010).\n\n\n\n"}

Frederick Reinhardt\n\nGeorge Frederick \"Fred\" Reinhardt (1911–1971) was an American foreign service officer and diplomat from 1937 until 1968. He was considered by his peers to be among the finest diplomats of his era. Reinhardt was the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam (1955–1957), to the United Arab Republic and North Yemen (1960–1961) and to Italy (1961–1968). In Vietnam, he worked to improve relations between the United States and South Vietnamese Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem.\n\nAmbassador Reinhardt was born in Berkeley, California on October 21, 1911, the eldest of two boys born to Dr. George F. Reinhardt, Sr. and Aurelia Henry Reinhardt (later to become president of Mills College). Reinhardt's father, George, was a well known physician who sat on the Medical Board of California (originally the Board of Examiners of the Medical Society of California), serving as the organization's Vice President in 1908 and its President in 1909. Dr. George Reinhardt was also the first University Physician and Professor of Hygiene at the University of California, Berkeley, where he founded the country's first, comprehensive, prepaid, student health program and hospital, in 1906. George died in Berkeley on June 7, 1914, when Reinhardt was not yet three years old.\n\nReinhardt attended Deep Springs School, in Deep Springs, CA. He then matriculated at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity, graduating in 1933 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in classics and modern languages. Reinhardt would win the Alumnus of the Year award from the Cal Alumni Association in 1962. He earned an M.A. from Cornell University in 1935 in the field of European history and international law, his dissertations were entitled, \"German interest in the Russo-Japanese war\" and \"International Control of Rivers for Non-Navigational Purposes.\" Reinhardt also earned a Diploma from Cesare Alfieri Institute, Florence, Italy in 1937. Reinhardt would also earn honorary doctorates from Universities of California, Gonzaga and Mills College.\n\nReinhardt began his professional career serving on the United States and Mexico International Boundary Commission. In 1937 Reinhardt began his foreign service as the vice-consul in Vienna, Austria. There, in March 1938, he witnessed the Austrian \"Anschluss.\" By the end of the year he had been recalled and begun training in Russian at Harvard University. In October 1939, he was designated third secretary of the legation and American vice consul in Tallinn, Estonia. By June 1940, Reinhardt was assigned for the first time to the Moscow embassy. Reinhardt assisted in the removal and liquidation of U.S. assets in the Baltic states following the Soviet annexation, he provided consular service to US nationals, and served as a Russian language interpreter. Reinhardt served as an interpreter during meetings between Joseph Stalin and President Roosevelt's personal representative, Harry Hopkins, and was considered only second, to Charles E. Bohlen, to interpret for Roosevelt at the Tehran Conference. In October 1941, as Moscow came under threat from the German army as a result of Operation Barbarossa, Reinhardt remained in the city under Llewellyn Thompson (the then Second Secretary at the U.S. Embassy to the Soviet Union), while Ambassador Laurence A. Steinhardt and other diplomatic personnel and news correspondents were evacuated to Kuibyshev.\n\nIn 1943, Reinhardt was then stationed in Algiers, to serve on Robert Murphy's Staff. He served as the U. S. representative for the Allied Control Commission for Italy while Bob Murphy went back to the U. S. on leave. His expertise were in high demand in the Mediterranean, both because of his expertise in Italian and experience with Soviet affairs. Dealing with the Soviets regarding Balkan concerns was a major reason for his involvement. \n\nWhen on 19 November 1951, the NATO Defense College opened its doors to Course 1 in Paris, Reinhardt was the only civilian senior instructor assigned to the course.\n\nDuring the spring of 1953 President Eisenhower asked Reinhardt to participate as a Russian expert as part of a top-secret program, named Project Solarium, examining the advantages and disadvantages of a series of military and political strategies seeking to \"roll back\" existing areas of Soviet influence and restore the prestige of the west. Reinhardt participated as a member of \"\"Task Force\" C\" delivering their recommendation to Eisenhower, John F. Dulles and other cabinet members on July 16, 1953. Project Solarium's findings produced NSC 162/2, a national strategy directive commonly assessed to have guided U.S. strategy from its publication to the end of the Cold War.\n\nThroughout the course of his Foreign Service career, Reinhardt held the following postings with the U.S. Department of State:\n\n\nIn December 1968, Reinhardt resigned from the Foreign Service shortly after a visit to Rome by President Johnson.\n\nFollowing his departure from the State Department, Reinhardt accepted a position with the Stanford Research Institute to run its office in Zurich, Switzerland. The Stanford Research Institute, operating today as SRI International, is a non-profit research center with offices around the world. The organization serves clients in the private and public sector to develop real-world implementation of varied R&D projects. Reinhardt retained this position until his death in 1971.\n\nOn September 10, 1949, Reinhardt married Lillian Larke \"Solie\" Tootle of Bethany, West Virginia at a ceremony in Weston, Connecticut. The two first met in Vienna prior to World War II and then became reacquainted in Paris when Solie was working for the Marshall Plan. They had four children: George Frederick (\"Fred\"), Anna Aurelia (\"Aura\"), Charles Henry (\"Harry\"), and Catherine Jane (\"Cathy\").\n\nReinhardt served on numerous boards and as a leader to a variety of organizations including the Telluride Association (member) and the American Foreign Service Association (President). He was also a member of the American Society of International Law, the Academy of Political Science, the American Academy of Political and Social Science, the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the US Naval Institute.\n\nReinhardt died of a heart attack on February 22, 1971, in Birmensdorf, Switzerland. He was buried at the Protestant Cemetery in Rome (Il Cimitero Acattolico di Roma), for which he had served as Administrator from 1961 until 1968, by virtue of his post as U.S. Ambassador. Following her death, the remains of Reinhardt's widow, Solie, were interred beside him in 2009.\n\n"}
{"id": "318069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318069", "title": "Goblin shark", "text": "Goblin shark\n\nThe goblin shark (\"Mitsukurina owstoni\") is a rare species of deep-sea shark. Sometimes called a \"living fossil\", it is the only extant representative of the family Mitsukurinidae, a lineage some 125 million years old. This pink-skinned animal has a distinctive profile with an elongated, flattened snout, and highly protrusible jaws containing prominent nail-like teeth. It is usually between long when mature, though it can grow considerably larger. Goblin sharks inhabit upper continental slopes, submarine canyons, and seamounts throughout the world at depths greater than , with adults found deeper than juveniles.\n\nVarious anatomical features of the goblin shark, such as its flabby body and small fins, suggest that it is sluggish in nature. This species hunts for teleost fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans both near the sea floor and in the middle of the water column. Its long snout is covered with ampullae of Lorenzini that enable it to sense minute electric fields produced by nearby prey, which it can snatch up by rapidly extending its jaws. Small numbers of goblin sharks are unintentionally caught by deepwater fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern, despite its rarity, citing its wide distribution and low incidence of capture.\n\nAmerican ichthyologist David Starr Jordan described the goblin shark in an 1898 issue of \"Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences\", recognizing the peculiar fish not only as a new species, but also a new genus and family. He based his account on an immature male long caught in Sagami Bay near Yokohama, Japan. The specimen had been acquired by shipmaster and naturalist Alan Owston, who had given it to Professor Kakichi Mitsukuri at the University of Tokyo, who in turn had brought it to Jordan. Thus, Jordan named the shark \"Mitsukurina owstoni\" in honor of these two men. The common name \"goblin shark\" is a translation of its old Japanese name \"tenguzame\", a \"tengu\" being a Japanese mythical creature often depicted with a long nose and red face. Another name for this species is elfin shark.\n\nShortly after Jordan's description was published, several scientists noted the similarity between \"Mitsukurina\" and the extinct Mesozoic shark \"Scapanorhynchus\". For a time, the prevailing view was to treat \"Mitsukurina\" as a junior synonym of \"Scapanorhynchus\". Eventually, more complete fossils revealed many anatomical differences between \"Scapanorhynchus\" and \"Mitsukurina\", leading modern authors to again regard them as distinct genera. Several goblin shark specimens were described as separate species from 1904 to 1937, none of which are now considered valid. This taxonomic confusion arose because the specimens' jaws were fixed at varying degrees of protrusion during preservation, giving the appearance of proportional differences in the head.\n\nPhylogenetic studies based on morphology have generally placed the goblin shark as the most basal member of the order Lamniformes, known as mackerel sharks. Studies using genetic data have also supported a basal position for this species. The family Mitsukurinidae, represented by \"Mitsukurina\", \"Scapanorhynchus\", and \"Anomotodon\", dates back to the Aptian age of the Cretaceous period (\"c.\" 125–113 Ma). \"Mitsukurina\" itself first appears in the fossil record during the Middle Eocene (\"c.\" 49–37 Ma); extinct species include \"M. lineata\" and \"M. maslinensis\". \"Striatolamia macrota\", which lived in warm shallow waters during the Paleogene (\"c.\" 66–23 Ma), may also be a \"Mitsukurina\" species. As the last member of an ancient lineage, and one that retains several \"primitive\" traits, the goblin shark has been described as a \"living fossil\".\n\nThe goblin shark has a distinctively long and flat snout, resembling a sword blade. The proportional length of the snout decreases with age. The eyes are small and lack protective nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are spiracles. The large mouth is parabolic in shape. The jaws are highly protrusible and can be extended almost to the end of the snout, though normally they are held flush against the underside of the head. It has 35–53 upper and 31–62 lower tooth rows. The teeth in the main part of the jaws are long and narrow, particularly those near the symphysis (jaw midpoint), and are finely grooved lengthwise. The rear teeth near the corners of the jaw are small and have a flattened shape for crushing. Much individual variation in tooth length and width occurs, in whether the teeth have a smaller cusplet on each side of the main cusp, and in the presence of toothless gaps at the symphysis or between the main and rear teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with the gill filaments inside partly exposed; the fifth pair is above the origin of the pectoral fins.\n\nThe body is fairly slender and flabby. The two dorsal fins are similar in size and shape, both being small and rounded. The pectoral fins are also rather small and rounded. The pelvic and anal fins have long bases and are larger than the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle is flattened from side-to-side and lacks keels or notches. The asymmetric caudal fin has a long upper lobe with a shallow ventral notch near the tip, and an indistinct lower lobe. The soft, semitranslucent skin has a rough texture from a covering of dermal denticles, each shaped like a short upright spine with lengthwise ridges. In life, this species is pink or tan due to visible blood vessels beneath the skin; the color deepens with age, and young sharks may be almost white. The fins' margins are translucent gray or blue, and the eyes are black with bluish streaks in the iris. After death, the coloration quickly fades to dull gray or brown. Adult sharks usually measure between long. However, the capture of an enormous female estimated at long in 2000 showed this species can grow far larger than previously suspected. The maximum weight on record is for a 3.8-m-long shark.\n\nThe generic name honors Keigo Mitsukuri, a Japanese zoologist who studied at University College London during the 1860s. The specific name honors Alan Owston, an English collector of Asian wildlife.\n\nThe goblin shark has been caught in all three major oceans, indicating a wide global distribution. In the Atlantic Ocean, it has been recorded from the northern Gulf of Mexico, Suriname, French Guiana, and southern Brazil in the west, and France, Portugal, Madeira, and Senegal in the east. It has also been collected from seamounts along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In the Indo-Pacific and Oceania, it has been found off South Africa, Mozambique, Japan, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand. A single eastern Pacific specimen is known, collected off southern California. This species is most often found over the upper continental slope at depths of . It has been caught as deep as , and a tooth has been found lodged in an undersea cable at a depth of . Adults inhabit greater depths than juveniles. Immature goblin sharks frequent the submarine canyons off southern Japan at depths of , with individuals occasionally wandering into inshore waters as shallow as . In April 2014, fishermen in Key West, Florida, while fishing in the Gulf of Mexico caught a goblin shark in their fishing net, only the second one ever to be caught in the Gulf. The shark was photographed and released back into the water.\n\nIn July 2014, a goblin shark was found in a fishery net in Sri Lanka, reported in Valaichchenai eastern coastal line in Sri Lanka. The shark was about long and weighed about The shark was given to the NARA (National Aquatic Resource Research & Development Agency) for further research.\n\nAlthough observations of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests its lifestyle is inactive and sluggish. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly calcified, the muscle blocks along its sides (myomeres) are weakly developed, and its fins are soft and small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout appears to have a sensory function, as it bears numerous ampullae of Lorenzini that can detect the weak electric fields produced by other animals. Due to the snout's softness, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed. Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small optic tectum in the shark's brain. Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its pupils, thus probably does use its sight in some situations. Goblin sharks may fall prey to the blue shark (\"Prionace glauca\"). Parasites documented from this species include the copepod \"Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae\", and the tapeworms \"Litobothrium amsichensis\" and \"Marsupiobothrium gobelinus\".\n\nThe goblin shark feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as rattails and dragonfishes. It also consumes cephalopods and crustaceans, including decapods and isopods. Garbage has been recorded from the stomachs of some specimens. Its known prey includes bottom-dwelling species such as the blackbelly rosefish (\"Helicolenus dactylopterus\"), and midwater species such as the squid \"Teuthowenia pellucida\" and the ostracod \"Macrocypridina castanea rotunda\". Thus, the goblin shark appears to forage for food both near the sea floor and far above it.\n\nSince it is not a fast swimmer, the goblin shark may be an ambush predator. Its low-density flesh and large oily liver make it neutrally buoyant, allowing it to drift towards its prey with minimal motions so as to avoid detection. Once prey comes into range, the shark's specialized jaws can snap forward to capture it. The protrusion of the jaw is assisted by two pairs of elastic ligaments associated with the mandibular joint, which are pulled taut when the jaws are in their normal retracted position; when the shark bites, the ligaments release their tension and essentially \"catapult\" the jaws forward. At the same time, the well-developed basihyal (analogous to a tongue) on the floor of the mouth drops, expanding the oral cavity and sucking in water and prey. Striking and prey capture events were videotaped and recorded for the first time in 2008 and 2011 and helped to confirm the use and systematics of the protrusible goblin shark jaws. The video evidence suggests that while the jaws are definitely unique, goblin sharks use ram feeding, a type of prey capture that is typical of many mackerel sharks. What makes the goblin shark unique is the kinematics of their jaw when feeding. The lower jaw seems to undergo more complex movements and is key in capturing the prey. The measured protrusions of the upper and lower jaw combined put the goblin shark jaws at 2.1–9.5 times more protrusible than other sharks. The lower jaw has a velocity about two times greater than the upper jaw because it not only protrudes forward, but also swings upward to capture the prey, and the maximum velocity of the jaws is 3.14 m/s. The goblin shark has a re-opening and re-closing pattern during the strike, a behavior that has never been seen in other sharks before and could be related to the extent with which the goblin shark protrudes its jaws. This “slingshot” style of feeding could be an adaptation to compensate for poor swimming ability by allowing the goblin shark to catch elusive, fast prey without having to chase the prey.\n\nLittle is known about goblin shark reproduction because a pregnant female has yet to be found and studied. It likely shares the reproductive characteristics of other mackerel sharks, which are viviparous with small litter sizes and embryos that grow during gestation by eating undeveloped eggs (oophagy). The birth size is probably close to , the length of the smallest known specimen. Males mature sexually at about long, while female maturation size is unknown. No data is available on growth and aging.\n\nGiven the depths at which it lives, the goblin shark poses no danger to humans. A few specimens have been collected alive and brought to public aquariums, though they only survived a short time. One was kept at Tokai University and lived for a week, while another was kept at Tokyo Sea Life Park and lived for two days. Its economic significance is minimal; the meat may be dried and salted, while the jaws fetch high prices from collectors. At one time, the Japanese also used it for liver oil and fertilizer. This shark is not targeted by any fisheries, but is occasionally found as bycatch in bottom gillnets and trawls, hooked on longlines, or entangled in fishing gear. Most captures are isolated incidents; one of the few areas where it is caught regularly is off southern Japan, where around 30 individuals (mostly juveniles) are taken each year. A black scabbardfish (\"Aphanopus carbo\") fishery off Madeira also takes two or three goblin sharks annually. In April 2003, over a hundred goblin sharks were caught off northwestern Taiwan; the cause of the event was unknown, though observers noted it was preceded by a major earthquake. The species had never been recorded in the area before, nor has it been found in such numbers since. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the goblin shark under Least Concern. In addition to its wide range, most of its population is thought to reside in unfished environments because few adults are caught. Therefore, it is not believed to be threatened by human activity.\n\n"}

It is the third most common cause of severe HDN. Rh disease is the most common and hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Kell) is the second most common cause of severe HDN.\n\nIt occurs more commonly in women who are Rh D negative.\n\nA Rhc negative mother can become sensitised by red blood cell (RBC) Rhc antigens by her first pregnancy with a Rhc positive fetus. The mother can make IgG anti-Rhc antibodies, which are able to pass through the placenta and enter the fetal circulation. If the fetus is Rhc positive alloimmune hemolysis can occur leading to HDN. This is similar as for Rh disease, which is usually caused when a RhD negative mother is sensitised by her first pregnancy with a RhD positive fetus.\n\nSensitization to Rhc antigens can also be caused by blood transfusion.\n\nIt has been suggested that women of child-bearing age or young girls should not be given a transfusion with Rhc positive blood (or Kell positive blood for similar reasons). This would require a lot of extra work in blood transfusion departments and it is considered not economical to do the blood group screening at the present time.\n\nIt is theoretically likely that IgG anti-Rhc antibody injections would prevent sensitization to RBC surface Rhc antigens in a similar way that IgG anti-D antibodies (Rho(D) Immune Globulin) are used to prevent Rh disease, but the methods for IgG anti-Rhc antibodies have not been developed at the present time.\n\nHemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDN) is a condition where the passage of maternal antibodies results in the hemolysis of fetal/neonatal red cells. The antibodies can be naturally occurring such as anti-A, and anti-B, or immune antibodies developed following a sensitizing event. Isoimmunization occurs when the maternal immune system is sensitized to red blood cell surface antigens. The most common causes of isoimmunization are blood transfusion, and fetal-maternal hemorrhage. The hemolytic process can result in anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, neonatal thrombocytopenia, and neonatal neutropenia. With the use of RhD Immunoprophylaxis, (commonly called Rhogam), the incidence of anti-D has decreased dramatically and other alloantibodies are now a major cause of HDN.\n\nAnti-C and anti-c can both show a negative DAT but still have a severely affected infant. An indirect coombs must also be run.\n\nIn the case of anti-c, the woman should be checked around 28 weeks to see if she has developed anti-E as well.\n\nTesting for HDN involves blood work from both mother and father, and may also include assessment with amniocentesis and Middle Cerebral Artery scans.\n\nBlood testing for the mother is called an Indirect Coombs Test (ICT) or an Indirect Agglutination Test (IAT). This test tells whether there are antibodies in the maternal plasma. If positive, the antibody is identified and given a titer. Critical titers are associated with significant risk of fetal anemia and hydrops. Titers of 1:8 or higher is considered critical for Kell. Titers of 1:16 or higher are considered critical for all other antibodies. After critical titer is reached, care is based on MCA scans. If antibodies are low and have a sudden jump later in pregnancy, an MCA scan is warranted. If the titer undergoes a 4 fold increase, it should be considered significant regardless of if the critical value has been reached. It should be noted that maternal titers are not useful in predicting fetal anemia after the first affected gestation and should not be used for the basis of care. Titers are tested monthly until 24 weeks, after which they are done every 2 weeks.\n\n\"In only 2 situations are patients not monitored identically to patients who are Rh sensitized. The first is that of alloimmunization to the c, E, or, C antigens. Some concern exists that hemolysis may occur in these patients with a lower than 1:16 titer. Thus, if the initial titer is 1:4 and stable but increases at 26 weeks' gestation to 1:8, assessment with MCA Doppler velocity at that point is reasonable. However, if the patient presents in the first trimester with a 1:8 titer that remains stable at 1:8 throughout the second trimester, continued serial antibody titers are appropriate.\nThe second situation in which patients should not be treated identically to patients who are Rh D sensitized is that of Kell isoimmunization because several cases of severe fetal hemolysis with anti-Kell antibodies have occurred in the setting of low titers.\"\n\nIn the case of a positive ICT, the woman must carry a medical alert card or bracelet for life because of the risk of a transfusion reaction.\n\nBlood is generally drawn from the father to help determine fetal antigen status. If he is homozygous for the antigen, there is a 100% chance of all offspring in the pairing to be positive for the antigen and at risk for HDN. If he is heterozygous, there is a 50% chance of offspring to be positive for the antigen. This test can help with knowledge for the current baby, as well as aid in the decision about future pregnancies. With RhD, the test is called the RhD genotype. With RhCE, and Kell antigen it is called an antigen phenotype.\n\nThere are 3 possible ways to test the fetal antigen status. Free Cell DNA, Amniocentesis, and Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS). Of the three, CVS is no longer used due to risk of worsening the maternal antibody response. Once antigen status has been determined, assessment may be done with MCA scans.\n\n\nMCA scans Middle cerebral artery - peak systolic velocity is changing the way sensitized pregnancies are managed. This test is done noninvasively with ultrasound. By measuring the peak velocity of blood flow in the middle cerebral artery, a MoM (multiple of the median) score can be calculated. MoM of 1.5 or greater indicates severe anemia and should be treated with IUT.\n\nThere are several intervention options available in early, mid and late pregnancies.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, the direct coombs will be negative but severe, even fatal HDN can occur. An indirect coombs needs to be run in cases of anti-C, anti-c, and anti-M. Anti-M also recommends antigen testing to rule out the presence of HDN. \n\n\n\nOnce a woman has antibodies, she is at high risk for a transfusion reaction. For this reason, she must carry a medical alert card at all times and inform all doctors of her antibody status.\n\n\"Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions may be either immune-mediated or nonimmune-mediated. Immune-mediated hemolytic transfusion reactions caused by immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-A, anti-B, or anti-A,B typically result in severe, potentially fatal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis. Immune-mediated hemolytic reactions caused by IgG, Rh, Kell, Duffy, or other non-ABO antibodies typically result in extravascular sequestration, shortened survival of transfused red cells, and relatively mild clinical reactions. Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions due to immune hemolysis may occur in patients who have no antibodies detectable by routine laboratory procedures.\"\n\nSummary of transfusion reactions in the US.\n\n\n\n"}

The trajectory is described using a histogram of the directions between each two consecutive points. Given a trajectory T = {P, P, P, ..., P}, where P is the 2D position at time t. For each pair of positions P and P, calculate the direction angle θ(t, t+1). Value of θ is between 0 and 360. A histogram of the quantized values of θ is created. If the histogram is of 8 bins, the first bin represents all θs between 0 and 45.\n\nThe histogram accumulates the lengths of the consecutive moves. For each θ, a specific histogram bin is determined. The length of the line between P and P is then added to the specific histogram bin.\n\nTo show the intuition behind the descriptor, consider the action of waving hands. At the end of the action, the hand falls down. When describing this down movement, the descriptor does not care about the position from which the hand started to fall. This fall will affect the histogram with the appropriate angles and lengths, regardless of the position where the hand started to fall.\n\nHOD records for each moving point: how much it moves in each range of directions. HOD has a clear physical interpretation. It proposes that, a simple way to describe the motion of an object, is to indicate how much distance it moves in each direction. If the movement in all directions are saved accurately, the movement can be repeated from the initial position to the final destination regardless of the displacements order. However, the temporal information will be lost, as the order of movements is not stored-this is what we solve by applying the temporal pyramid, as shown in section \\ref{sec:temp-pyramid}. If the angles quantization range is small, classifiers that use the descriptor will overfit. Generalization needs some slack in directions-which can be done by increasing the quantization range.\n\n"}
{"id": "2185562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185562", "title": "Human branding", "text": "Human branding\n\nHuman branding or stigmatizing is the process which a mark, usually a symbol or ornamental pattern, is burned into the skin of a living person, with the intention that the resulting scar makes it permanent. This is performed using a hot or very cold branding iron. It therefore uses the physical techniques of livestock branding on a human, either with consent as a form of body modification; or under coercion, as a punishment or to identify an enslaved or otherwise oppressed person. It may also be practiced as a \"rite of passage\", e.g. within a tribe, or to signify membership of or acceptance into an organization.\n\nThe English verb to \"burn\", attested since the 12th century, is a combination of Old Norse \"brenna\" \"to burn, light\", and two originally distinct Old English verbs: \"bærnan\" \"to kindle\" (transitive) and \"beornan\" \"to be on fire\" (intransitive), both from the Proto-Germanic root \"bren(wanan)\", perhaps from a Proto-Indo-European root \"bhre-n-u\", from base root \"bhereu-\" \"to boil forth, well up.\" In Dutch, \"(ver)branden\" mean \"to burn\", \"brandmerk\" a branded mark; similarly, in German, \"Brandzeichen\" means \"a brand\" and \"brandmarken\", \"to brand\".\n\nSometimes, the word \"cauterize\" is used. This is known in English since 1541, and is derived via Medieval French \"cauteriser\" from Late Latin \"cauterizare\" \"to burn or brand with a hot iron\", itself from Greek καυτηριάζειν, \"kauteriazein\", from καυτήρ \"kauter\" \"burning or branding iron\", from καίειν \"kaiein\" \"to burn\". However \"cauterization\" is now generally understood to mean a medical process – specifically to stop bleeding.\n\nThe origin may be the ancient treatment of a slave (often without legal rights) as livestock.\n\nTo a slave owner it would be logical to mark such property just like cattle, more so since humans are more able to escape.\n\nIn criminal law, branding with a hot iron was a mode of punishment consisting of marking the subject as if goods or animals, sometimes concurrently with their reduction of status in life.\n\nBrand marks have also been used as a punishment for convicted criminals, combining physical punishment, as burns are very painful, with public humiliation (greatest if marked on a normally visible part of the body) which is here the more important intention, and with the imposition of an indelible criminal record.\nRobbers, like runaway slaves, were marked by the Romans with the letter F (\"fur\"); and the toilers in the mines, and convicts condemned to figure in gladiatorial shows, were branded on the forehead for identification. Under Constantine I the face was not permitted to be so disfigured, the branding being on the hand, arm or calf.\n\nThe Acts of Sharbil record it applied, amongst other tortures, to a Christian between the eyes and on the cheeks in Parthian Edessa at the time of the Roman Emperor Trajan on a judge's order for refusal to sacrifice.\n\nIn the 16th century, German Anabaptists were branded with a cross on their foreheads for refusing to recant their faith and join the Roman Catholic church.\n\nIn the North-American Puritan settlements of the 17th century, men and women sentenced for adultery were branded with an \"A\" letter on their chest, and for other crimes, such as \"D\" for drunkenness and \"B\" for blasphemy.\n\nThe mark in later times was also often chosen as a code for the crime (e.g. in Canadian military prisons D for Desertion, BC for Bad Character; most branded men were shipped off to a penal colony). Branding was used for a time by the Union Army during the American Civil War. Surgeon and Oxford English Dictionary contributor William Chester Minor was required to brand deserters at around the time of the Battle of the Wilderness.\n\nUntil 1832 in France, various offenses carried the additional infamy of being branded with a fleur de lis and galley-slaves could be branded GAL or, once the galleys were replaced by the \"bagnes\" on land, TF (\"travaux forcés\", 'forced' labor, i.e. hard labour) or TFP (\"travaux forcés à perpetuité\", hard labour for life). In most of the German-speaking states, however, branding people was unlawful. \n\nFollowing the Conspiracy of the Slaves of 1749 in Malta, some slaves were branded with the letter R (for \"ribelli\") on their forehead and condemned to the galleys for life.\n\nBranding tended to be abolished like other judicial mutilations (with notable exceptions, such as amputation under sharia law), sooner and more widely than flogging, caning, and similar corporal punishments, which normally aim 'only' at pain and at worst cause stripe scars, although the most severe lashings (not uncommon in penal colonies) in terms of dosage and instrument (such as the proverbial knout) can even turn out to cause death.\n\nIn Louisiana, there was a \"black code\", or \"Code Noir\", which allowed the cropping of ears, shoulder branding, and hamstringing, the cutting of tendons near the knee, as punishments for recaptured slaves. Slave owners used extreme punishments to stop flight, or escape. They would often brand the slaves' palms, shoulders, buttocks, or cheeks with a branding iron.\n\nBranding was sometimes used to mark recaptured runaway slaves to help the locals easily identify the runaway. Mr. Micajah Ricks, in Raleigh, North Carolina, was looking for his slave and described, \"I burnt her with a hot iron, on the left side of her face, I tried to make the letter M.\"\n\nMost slave owners would use whipping as their main method, but at other times they would use branding to punish their slaves. Another testimony explains how a slave owner in Kentucky around 1848 was looking for his runaway slave. He described her having \"a brand mark on the breast something like L blotched.\" In South Carolina, there were many laws which permitted the punishments slaves would receive. When a slave ran away, if it was the first offense, the slave would receive no more than forty lashes. Then the second offense would be branding. The slave would have been marked with the letter R on their forehead signifying that they were a criminal, and a runaway.\n\nCeremonial Branding is an integral part of religious initiation in most Vaishnava sects. References to this practice can be traced in texts such as Narad Panchratra, Vaikhnasagama, Skanda Purana etc. This practice is still in vogue among Madhava sect Brahmins of Karnataka in India.\n\nThe punishment was adopted by the Anglo-Saxons, and the ancient law of England authorized the penalty. By the \nStatute of Vagabonds (1547) under King Edward VI, vagabonds and Gypsies were ordered to be branded with a large V on the breast, and brawlers with F for \"fraymaker\"; slaves who ran away were branded with S on the cheek or forehead. This law was repealed in England in 1550. From the time of Henry VII, branding was inflicted for all offences which received Benefit of clergy (branding of the thumbs was used around 1600 at Old Bailey to ensure that the accused who had successfully used the Benefit of Clergy defence, by reading a passage from the Bible, could not use it more than once), but it was abolished for such in 1822. In 1698 it was enacted that those convicted of petty theft or larceny, who were entitled to benefit of clergy, should be \"burnt in the most visible part of the left cheek, nearest the nose.\" This special ordinance was repealed in 1707. James Nayler, a Quaker who in the year 1655 was accused of claiming to be the Messiah, convicted of blasphemy in a highly publicized trial before the Second Protectorate Parliament and had his tongue bored through and his forehead branded B for \"blasphemer\".\n\nIn the Lancaster criminal court a branding iron is still preserved in the dock. It is a long bolt with a wooden handle at one end and an M (malefactor) at the other; close by are two iron loops for firmly securing the hands during the operation. The brander would, after examination, turn to the judge exclaiming \"A fair mark, my lord.\" Criminals were formerly ordered to hold up their hands before sentence to show if they had been previously convicted.\n\nIn the 18th century, cold branding or branding with cold irons became the mode of nominally inflicting the punishment on prisoners of higher rank. \"When Charles Moritz, a young German, visited England in 1782 he was much surprised at this custom, and in his diary mentioned the case of a clergyman who had fought a duel and killed his man in Hyde Park. Found guilty of manslaughter he was burnt in the hand, if that could be called burning which was done with a cold iron\" (Markham's \"Ancient Punishments of Northants\", 1886).\n\nSuch cases led to branding becoming obsolete, and it was abolished in 1829 except in the case of deserters from the army, who were marked with the letter D, not with hot irons but by tattooing with ink or gunpowder. Notoriously bad soldiers were also branded with BC (bad character). The British Mutiny Act of 1858 provided that the court-martial might, in addition to any other penalty, order deserters to be marked on the left side, 2 inches (5 cm) below the armpit, with the letter D, such letter to be not less than an inch long. In 1879 this was abolished.\n\nOffenders in Australia were subject to branding in accordance with British law. In 1826, in Hobart, Joseph Clarke was charged with manslaughter and ‘sentenced to be burnt in the hand’. In 1850, in New South Wales, deserter Daniel O’Neil was tattooed with the letter ‘D’. \n\nBranding in Russia was used quite extensively in the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. Over time, red hot iron brands were gradually replaced by tattoo boards; criminals were first branded on the forehead and cheeks, later on the back and arms. Branding was totally abolished in 1863.\n\nForced and enslaved prostitutes are often tattooed or branded with a mark of their owners. Women and girls being forced into prostitution would have their boss’s name or gang symbol inked or branded with hot iron on their skin. In some organizations involved with the trafficking of women and girls like the mafias nearly all prostitutes are marked. Some pimps and organisations use their name or well-known symbol, others are using secret signs.\n\nThe branding is both painful and humiliating for the prostitute, especially when done with a branding iron, and may be also a form of punishment and of psychological submission for the prostitutes.\n\nSome years ago the brands were usually small, only recognized by other pimps, sometimes hidden between the inner vaginal lips, though other instances show that pimps have no issue with larger more noticeable brands \n\n\nIn symbolic solidarity with Calf 269, protesters in Israel subjected themselves to branding on World Farm Animals Day (Gandhi's birthday): October 2, 2012. This act was emulated by others in England and the Czech Republic. An English protester who was interviewed justified the extremism as a reaction to the extreme cruelty perpetrated by the dairy industry such as shooting calves at birth.\n\n\n"}

He was known to hunt down and execute resistance fighters during World War II, as well as for his participation in anti-semitic programs, including the deportation of French Jews to Drancy and extermination camps. After his escape from France, he was convicted of war crimes and condemned to death.\n\nHe was aided in entering Quebec, Canada in 1946 by leading Catholics of the province. In 1948 his true identity was discovered by immigration officials, who instituted deportation proceedings. De Bernonville fled to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he lived the rest of his life. In 1957 the Supreme Court of Brazil refused to approve an extradition order. He was murdered by asphyxiation in 1972 by his servant's son.\n\nCount Jacques Dugé de Bernonville was born in Paris to an aristocratic family and educated in Jesuit schools. He became aligned with conservative political groups.\n\nIn 1938, he was imprisoned for several months, charged with having taken part in the conspiracy of \"La Cagoule,\" a far right terrorist group. He was released because of lack of proof.\n\nFollowing the 1940 defeat of France against Nazi Germany, Jacques de Bernonville joined the Vichy government. In 1943 he was appointed as a commander of the collaborationist Milice, the Vichy police. Working in conjunction with the head of the Milice Joseph Darnand, de Bernonville hunted down members of the French Resistance. They were almost always summarily executed.\n\nAs a right-hand man to Klaus Barbie (later convicted for crimes against humanity), de Bernonville participated in the establishment and enforcement of the Vichy regime's program of anti-Semitic policies. They carried out the deportation of thousands of French Jews, refugee Jews and other \"undesirables\" to the Drancy deportation camp en route to Auschwitz and other German extermination camps.\n\nAfter the liberation of France by the Allied Forces, de Bernonville was charged with war crimes but fled the country. He was tried \"in absentia\" by a French War Crimes tribunal in Toulouse. There he was found guilty and condemned to death.\n\nEscaping French authorities in 1946, de Bernonville sailed to New York City. According to historians such as Kevin Henley, professor of history at Collège de Maisonneuve in Montreal, the politically powerful Roman Catholic priest Lionel Groulx helped de Bernonville get into Quebec. He was welcomed by a significant number of the Quebec nationalist elite, but in 1948 Canadian immigration authorities discovered his identity and instituted deportation proceedings. In an attempt to keep de Bernonville in Canada, 143 Quebec notables signed a 1950 petition defending him and stating that he should be allowed to stay. Signers included the secretary general of the Université de Montréal; Camillien Houde, mayor of the city of Montreal; plus Camille Laurin and Denis Lazure, two future cabinet ministers in the Parti Québécois government.\n\nFaced with a deportation order, de Bernonville fled again, going to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1954 the French government was advised of his location but, since Brazil had no extradition treaty with France, he escaped punishment. The Supreme Court of Brazil refused to extradite him in October 1957. Bernonville remained in Brazil. He died in 1972, murdered by the son of his servant.\n\n\n"}

He played for 15 seasons in the Major League Baseball and has played 4 seasons of independent and Mexican League baseball since leaving MLB.\n\nHe most recently managed the Licey Tigers of the Dominican Winter League, leading them to the 2008–2009 and 2013–2014 Dominican Winter League Championship. During a baseball game on January 16, 2010, Offerman attacked an umpire during an argument and, as a result, was banned from the Winter League for three years. He managed the Rojos del Águila de Veracruz of the Mexican League in 2014.\n\nAfter attending Colegio Biblico Cristiano High School in San Pedro de Macorís, Offerman signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 1986. In , he completed his first season of professional play being named as Best Prospect in the Pioneer League. Progressing rapidly through the minor leagues, he made his major league debut against the Montreal Expos on August 19, becoming the 55th player in major league history to hit a home run in his first major league at-bat.\n\nBy , Offerman became the Dodgers' starting shortstop. On opening day 1993, he was the first batter to ever face the Florida Marlins, striking out against Charlie Hough. He made his first appearance in the All-Star Game in 1995 but was traded to the Kansas City Royals after the season, mostly because of his very poor defense. After a year as a utility player, he won the starting second baseman job in 1997. Offerman had his best offensive seasons in Kansas City, culminating in , when he hit .315 with a league-leading 13 triples and the fifth most stolen bases, 45. After that season, he signed with the Boston Red Sox as a free agent, making the All-Star Game for the second time in 1999.\n\nKnown more for his hitting skills than his fielding, Offerman's offense began to decline in . He was sent to the Seattle Mariners during the season, but was released afterwards. In , he joined the Montreal Expos in spring training but was cut before the regular season began. He spent the entire year with the Bridgeport Bluefish of the independent Atlantic League. In , he won a spot on the Minnesota Twins roster and led the league in pinch-hits with 12 in 29 attempts. He started with the Philadelphia Phillies but was released after a slow start. Later, he signed with the New York Mets and was called back up to the majors in June.\n\nMost recently, Offerman played in the 2008 Caribbean World Series for the Licey Tigers – Dominican Republic 2 team – where he assisted the team in winning its 10th Caribbean World Series title. During the series he signed a contract with the 2008 Veracruz Red Eagles of the Mexican Summer League.\n\nIn December, 2008, Offerman was named player-manager of Licey Tigers of the Dominican Winter League. With Offerman as manager, Licey swept the Dominican Winter League Baseball Championships, winning five straight against the Gigantes del Cibao. As champions, Licey was then invited to participate in the 2009 Caribbean World Series with Offerman as manager (the series was ultimately won by Venezuela). (The Caribbean World Series is affiliated with the Winter League programs of Major League Baseball, featuring MLB players and prospects from the Dominican Winter League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.)\n\nOn January 7, 2014, Offerman was again named manager of the Licey Tigers of the Dominican Winter League, replacing Mike Guerrero. With Offerman at the helm, Licey won the Dominican Winter League Baseball Championships, winning five games to three over the Leones del Escogido. As champions again, Licey has been invited to the 2014 Caribbean World Series with Offerman as manager. At present, his team has qualified for the semifinals of the tournament.\n\nHe has not played or managed professional baseball in the United States since 2007. \nOn August 14, , Offerman was thrown out of a Ducks game against the Bridgeport Bluefish for charging Bluefish pitcher Matt Beech with a bat after he was hit by a pitch. Beech sustained broken finger in the resulting melee. Bluefish catcher John Nathans was also hit in the back of the head during the bench-clearing melee, receiving a severe concussion that effectively ended his playing career. Beech and Nathans were taken to Bridgeport Hospital where they were treated and released. After being removed from the game, Offerman was arrested by the Bridgeport Police.\n\nOn August 15, 2007, he was suspended indefinitely. The independent Atlantic League announced on August 17, 2007 that Offerman would remain suspended at least until the legal case was resolved.\n\nOn September 24, 2007, Offerman pleaded not guilty to two second degree assault charges.\n\nHis case was pending in Bridgeport Superior Court GA#2 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He was represented by Attorney Frank J. Riccio II. On October 30, 2007, Offerman was given two years special probation called \"Accelerated Rehabilitation ('AR').\" The Court determined that his actions on August 14, 2007 were of an aberrant nature. The Court also found that Offerman is not likely to offend again in the future.\n\nNathans filed a $4.8 million civil suit against Offerman in February 2009, claiming that he still has post-concussion syndrome and that the injury allegedly caused by Offerman ended his baseball career.\nOn July 29, 2014, Nathans won his suit, and Offerman was ordered to pay $940,000.\n\nOn 16 January 2010, Offerman once again engaged in an on-field assault when he struck an umpire while managing a Dominican Republic winter league game. Offerman, manager of the Licey Tigers, came onto the field during the third inning while losing a 6-0 game to the Cibao Giants, to protest ejection of his catcher for arguing balls and strikes and ended up arguing with first-base umpire D.J. Reyburn. He swung with a right hook at Reyburn, who then fell to the ground. Offerman was detained by stadium security, eventually being transported to the local police station to await the end of the game and Reyburn's decision whether to ask for charges to be pressed against him or not.\n\nA day after the incident, the American crew that umpired the game resigned their positions with the Dominican Baseball League and left the country, reportedly due to threats and concerns about their own safety. Because of this incident Offerman received a lifetime ban from the Dominican Republic Winter League, a suspension that was eventually lifted in February 2013. Coincidentally, at the time he was suspended, Offerman was replacing Dave Jauss as Licey manager after Jauss was suspended himself for two years for bumping an umpire during a playoff game.\n\nHe is the father of WWE ring announcer and former reality television star JoJo Offerman.\n\n\n"}

On 14 September 2015, her 16-year-old daughter Lisa Borch was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment for her mother's murder. Borch's boyfriend, 29-year-old Bakhtiar Mohammed Abdullah, was sentenced to 13 years in prison, followed by deportation. The murder received international coverage, with sources highlighting Borch's viewing of videos of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant executions immediately prior to the murder.\n\nKvissel, which had a population of 412 in 2014, is a village of Frederikshavn Municipality, the most northerly Danish municipalities. Borch lived there with her mother, her stepfather Jens Holtegaard, and a twin sister. She had reportedly been in a relationship with an Islamic extremist, who ended it to return to his family in Sweden. Following this, she met Abdullah, originally from Iraq, at a nearby refugee centre. Jens Holtegaard stated that Borch was \"completely uncritically enthusiastic\" about migrants and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. She feuded with her parents over her relationship with Abdullah, leading her twin to leave home for a period. Lisa Borch showed a knife to her sister and claimed that she would murder their mother, a threat which was not taken seriously.\n\nTine Rømer Holtegaard was asleep, having taken sleeping pills, when she was stabbed at least 20 times in the chest.\n\nBorch, who according to computer records had been watching ISIL execution videos including those of David Haines and Alan Henning, contacted the police, claiming that her mother had screamed and she had seen a \"white man\" running away from their home. She was indifferent when the police informed her that her mother had been killed. Abdullah was not present when the police arrived, but was arrested on the strength of forensic evidence.\n\nBorch and Abdullah were tried in court in Hjørring. The prosecution argued that the aggravating factors were the brutality of the murder's planning and execution, Rømer Holtegaard having taken sleeping pills, and the crime having taken place in the victim's home. They also claimed that the pair were intending to fight in the Syrian Civil War. The defence said that Borch's sentence should be mitigated by her youth, and her being under the bad influence of others. The court could not prove which of the pair carried out the stabbing; both Borch and Abdullah were found guilty of murder. Borch's sentence was suggested by the prosecution, and was made possible because of a 2010 amendment to the law which scrapped a previous maximum eight-year sentence for criminals under 18; she was ordered to serve the first year in juvenile detention and the remaining eight in prison.\n\nHer stepfather told Danish newspaper \"BT\" that he disagreed with the court psychologists' conclusion that Borch's psychology showed psychopathic elements, claiming that she changed radically after meeting Abdullah. He also expressed fears that she would become further radicalised in prison. In an interview with \"Se og Hør\", he confessed that he felt as fragile as a \"Chinese porcelain doll\" after the murder of his partner of eleven years, sleeping upwards of 14 hours a day and being prescribed anti-anxiety medication.\n"}

In most of these cases, their murderer or murderers have also gone undiscovered.\n\nA white or Hispanic male between 15 and 18 years old was found buried in a Harris County boat shed in August 1973.\n\nThis youth is the only still-unidentified victim of serial killer Dean Corll, who, together with two teenage accomplices, killed at least 28 boys and young men between 1970 and 1973. This decedent was between 5 feet 2 and 5 feet 7 inches tall, had brown hair, and is believed to have worn striped swim trunks, boots, and a shirt displaying a peace symbol. These items were found near his body.\n\nHe had received good dental care, and had never received any teeth fillings in his lifetime. It is known that he suffered from a mild form of spina bifida. DNA testing conducted in 2008 did not match any missing person report.\n\nA forensic examination of the boy's remains, in addition to the circumstantial fact that he was buried between two identified victims of Dean Corll (killed in August 1971 and July 1972), indicated that he was most likely murdered in either 1971 or 1972.\n\nA 15- to 30-year-old woman discovered in Georgetown, Texas, on Halloween of 1979. Her body was naked save for a pair of orange socks. She had been killed by strangulation, and had contracted salpingitis in her lifetime.\n\nA teenage female whose body was discovered approximately six hours after she died on October 31 or November 1, 1980. Henry Lee Lucas has been named as a potential suspect in this case, although a bite mark found upon the decedent's shoulder was inconsistent with Lucas's dentistry.\n\nShe was estimated to be between the ages of 14 and 18 years old with brown hair and brown or hazel eyes. She had claimed to a waitress that she was 19 but the waitress did not believe her. She was described as wearing a yellow pullover sweater and red heeled sandals. She was also wearing a square or rectangular pendent necklace with a smokey blue or brown stone. The necklace was found on the body and the shoes were nearby but none of her clothing was located. \n\nWhen her body was found it was determined she had only been dead for several hours. She had been viciously sexually assaulted with a large foreign object. A truck driver had seen her body on the north bound side of highway 45 about a mile north of The Hitchin Post truck stop. \n\nThe waitress who spoke to her claimed the girl told her she was from the Aransas Pass/Rockport area but no missing persons were reported in that area around the time of her death.\n\nA young man and woman who were found in January 1981. They were killed approximately two months earlier and left in Houston.\n\nOn August 12, 1985, the body of a Hispanic female aged between 16 and 35 was found inside a vacant store. Her body was discovered alongside that of a man who was identified as Thomas Rodriguez, and her death had occurred hours prior to her discovery. She was between five feet and five feet two inches, and weighed approximately 120 to 140 pounds. Other distinctive details regarding this decedent include two sets of distinctive earrings she had worn which contained beads and shells, a tattoo of the letter 'V' on her upper left arm, and a scar resulting from her gallbladder being removed. A necklace with an arrowhead and turquoise stone design was also found on the girl's neck. It is unknown how both victims were placed at the scene.\n\nOn October 27, 1985, the skeleton of a male between fourteen and twenty-one was found in Springtown, Parker County, Texas. The victim's remains were found on a ranch along State Highway 51. He could have died as early as 1984, as a coin with that date was found at the site. The boy was a white male but may have had black ancestry. Because only some bones were located, his height and weight could not be estimated. His torso, along with one or both hands and limbs, was not recovered. The victim had received dental care, as fillings were found in his teeth. He had short brown hair and wore two gray jackets, one made of fleece and the other of cotton. He also wore jockey underwear and jeans. His exact cause of death is unknown, although his death is considered to be a homicide.\n\nOn March 26, 1986, a black woman was shot multiple times and left near a railroad. She was between 18 and 25, standing five feet eleven inches tall. The body had gone undiscovered for approximately three weeks to three months. The motive for the murder was apparently an argument. Ángel Maturino Reséndiz, a serial killer, confessed to her murder, claiming he had also killed the woman's boyfriend, whose remains are yet to be found. The woman wore a white gold ring, a striped blue short skirt, and a flannel jacket, which was also striped. She was believed to have been native to Florida, her first name reported to possibly be Norma. The woman, along with her boyfriend and another victim, has never been identified. Reséndiz apparently killed seventeen others.\n\nA black subject, twenty to thirty years old, who was likely a trans woman or a drag queen, was pronounced dead after being transported to a hospital when found unresponsive on July 10, 1986, in Live Oak, Houston, Harris County, Texas. The cause of death was strangulation, which may have been done with pantyhose. The subject was dressed in pink pants, a gray shirt, and a black belt with spikes. A pair of socks was under the shirt, likely used to mimic breasts. A heart tattoo containing a scroll was on one arm, and the victim's fingernails had been painted gold at one point. Four earrings were found in each ear; a ring with a clear stone, a ring without a stone, a silver chain, and two gold-colored necklaces were also found. The victim may have had a drug history, as needle marks were visible on the arms.\n\nA Hispanic male between fifteen and twenty-five was found stabbed to death on December 15, 1988, in Collin County, Texas. He had died a day before his body was found abandoned in a culvert. He wore a motorcyclist's jacket and a white and gray striped shirt, along with corduroy jeans, loafers, and a belt with a multi-colored buckle. He had a tattoo on his arm of the letters \"RYA\" inside a heart with an arrow through it, possibly representing a significant other or a family member. He was found wearing a watch, a bracelet, and two rubber rings. He was relatively short for a male, being five feet to five feet one inch tall. In his pockets, chap stick, a package of cigarettes, and a disposable lighter were found.\n\nOn September 25, 1989, the remains of a female aged 18-24 was located in Williamson County, Texas along Interstate 35. She was about 5'2\" tall at a weight between 110 and 120 pounds. Her ears were pierced, but only one earring was recovered. The victim also wore a necklace containing a white bead in the center, surrounded by two gold-colored beads on either side. She wore a white shirt with the words \"Cinco De Corona\" with the bottom cut into fringe, leading to her nickname, black pants a shirt cut into a bra with the words \"American Legends\" bearing a Native American design. She wore bikini panties and no shoes. The victim was shot to death.\n\nApproximately eight to ten hours after her death, a Hispanic female was located on Westheimer Street, in Houston, Harris County, Texas on December 29, 1989. She was five feet four inches and weighed 161 pounds; she was between nineteen and twenty-five, although she could have been up to thirty-five. The victim wore black pants, socks and shoes as well as a white bra, panties, pullover and socks. Her hair was black and curly, approximately twenty inches long. Her eyes were also brown. A piece of paper was found at the scene that was written by hand containing some sort of schedule. The woman had been shot at close range in the head. After her body remained unidentified, she was buried in an unmarked grave in a potter's field.\n\nA young adult who was found burning in Kilgore, Texas on October 29, 2006. Her nickname originated from the purple sweater that she wore.\n\nA female between seventeen and twenty-six was discovered in Kendall County, Texas, on March 6, 2010. The victim's race was either Hispanic or Caucasian, possibly being a mix of both. Examination revealed that she had had a large amount of dental work as well as a previous open heart surgery. Deformities were also present on the feet. She had died between one year and a decade prior to the discovery.\n\nThe decomposed remains of a Hispanic woman were found on a beach, scavenged by coyotes, on October 10, 2012, in South Padre Island, Cameron County, Texas. The victim's body was likely exposed due to changes with water levels on the beach. The woman had been dead from one to several weeks before her remains were discovered. The sand above the body had been \"covered with lime,\" possibly to speed decomposition or plant growth, likely as a way to prevent the body from being found or identified. Her height was estimated to be four feet ten to five feet two inches tall and her weight at about 95 to 120 pounds. She was middle-aged, approximately forty-two to fifty-five, at the time of death. One or more of the female's limbs were not found with the body, as they were likely carried away by animals. A distinctive feature about this female was that she had her make-up permanently tattooed on her eyebrows, eyelids and lips. Her ears had also been pierced. She was clothed, wearing a dark top, multicolored shorts with star decorations and bikini underwear, along with a sanitary pad. The woman's death is considered to be due to foul play and a \"suspicious\" white-colored \"powder\" was found on the face region. Since her discovery, a three-dimensional reconstruction and a sketch have been created of the victim.\n\n\n"}

The exact year of his birth is unknown but it was between 1280 and 1292. He was the founder of the last ruling dynasty of the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Shishman dynasty. After he was crowned, however, Michael used the name Asen to emphasize his connection with the Asen dynasty, the first one to rule over the Second Empire.\n\nAn energetic and ambitious ruler, Michael Shishman led an aggressive but opportunistic and inconsistent foreign policy against the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Serbia, which ended in the disastrous battle of Velbazhd which claimed his own life. He was the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who aimed at military and political hegemony of the Bulgarian Empire over the Balkans and the last one who attempted to seize Constantinople. He was succeeded by his son Ivan Stephen and later by his nephew Ivan Alexander, who reversed his policy by forming an alliance with Serbia.\n\nBorn between 1280 and 1292 Michael Shishman was the son of the despot Shishman of Vidin by an unnamed daughter of the \"sebastokrator\" Peter and Anna (Theodora), herself daughter of Ivan Asen II (r. 1218-1241) and Irene Komnene of Epirus. He was also a distant cousin of his predecessors on the Bulgarian throne, Theodore Svetoslav (r. 1300-1321) and George Terter II (r. 1321-1322). After the peace between his father and Stefan Milutin in 1292, Michael Shishman was engaged to Milutin's daughter Anna Neda and they married in 1298 or 1299.\n\nSince the middle of the 13th century, the area of Vidin had been autonomous under ineffective Bulgarian overlordship, and was ruled successively by Yakov Svetoslav (died 1276), Shishman (died between 1308 and 1313), and then Michael Shishman. Shishman and his son received the high courtly title of \"despotēs\" from their cousin Theodore Svetoslav and the latter was referred to in a contemporary Venetian source as a \"Despot of Bulgaria and Lord of Vidin\". With the death of the Serbian king Stefan Milutin, Michael Shishman was able to follow a more active policy in the Bulgarian capital Tarnovo. He soon became a leading noble in the internal affairs of the country and, on the childless death of young George Terter II in 1323, Michael Shishman was elected emperor of Bulgaria by the nobility. According to some historians he was chosen because he was a descendant of the Asen dynasty and interpret his ascencion to the throne not as the beginning of a new dynasty but rather as a continuation of the House of Asen. His half-brother, Belaur, succeeded him as despot of Vidin.\n\nThe sudden death of George Terter II had been followed by a brief period of confusion and uncertainty, which was exploited by the Byzantine emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. The Byzantines overran northeastern Thrace and captured a number of important cities including Yambol, Lardea, Ktenia, Rusokastro, Anchialus, Sozopol and Agatopol. At the same time, a Byzantine-sponsored pretender, Voysil, brother of the former Bulgarian emperor Smilets (r. 1292-1298), ensconced himself in Krăn, controlling the valleys between the Balkan mountains and Sredna Gora from Sliven to Kopsis. At this point the newly elected Michael Shishman marched south against Andronikos III, while another Byzantine army led by Andronikos III himself was besieging Philippopolis (Plovdiv). Defended by a Bulgarian garrison led by Ivan the Russian, the siege was a failure despite the Byzantines use of a 100-soldier, five-story siege tower. While the Byzantine army was engaged at Philipopolis, Michael Shishman led his troops to north-eastern Thrace and quickly retook the lost cities thus forcing the Byzantines to pull back.\n\nAlthough Michael Shishman forced Andronikos III to retreat, the Byzantines managed to take the Philippopolis while the Bulgarians were changing garrisons. Despite the loss, Michael Shishman was able to expel Voysil and fully recover Bulgarian control over northern and northeastern Thrace in 1324 which had been taken by the Byzantines in the previous year during the interregnum. Again in 1324, the Bulgarian emperor invaded Byzantium advancing as far as Trajanopolis and Vira in the lower course of the Maritsa river. Andronikos III was unable to engage the Bulgarian army because his troops were outnumbered. He offered Michael Shishman a duel to solve the conflict. The Bulgarian emperor answered with the words cited by John Kantakouzenos: \n\nThe Byzantine emperor was said to have been infuriated with the answer and the fact that he was outsmarted. However, Michael III who was informed of the conflict between Andronikos III and Andronikos II hinted him that he could help Andronikos III against his grandfather in case of war and returned to Bulgaria promising that soon he would begin negotiations.\n\nOn a council held in Constantinople on the relations with Bulgaria it was decided that the two countries should begin negotiations despite the calls for punishing the Bulgarians for the invasion. Michael Shishman divorced his wife Anna Neda and married Theodora Palaiologina, the 35-year-old widow of emperor Theodore Svetoslav. The exact reasons for that act are unclear. Many historians suggest that the deterioration of the Bulgarian-Serbian relations was rooted in the Serbian penetration in Macedonia. The marriage cemented the peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire but the need for an ally against the Serbs made Michael Shishman prone to make concessions. It was decided that the border should follow the Philippopolis-Chernomen-Sozopol line. The agreement was finally signed in the autumn of 1324 and Michael Shishman spent the next several years at peace with his neighbors.\n\nIn 1327 Michael Shishman became involved in the renewed civil war in the Byzantine Empire, taking the side of his brother-in-law Andronikos III, while his grandfather and rival Andronikos II obtained the support of the Serbian king. Andronikos III and Michael Shishman met at Chernomen (according to Nicephorus Gregoras at Dimotika) and concluded an aggressive alliance against Serbia. The Byzantine emperor promised to Bulgaria territory with several towns and large amount of money if he would become a sole emperor. Based on that alliance, Andronikos III gained control of Macedonia but his success made Michael Shishman, who aimed at a prolonged conflict within the Byzantine Empire, enter into negotiations with Andronikos II, offering military support in exchange for money and the cession of some border lands. The Bulgarian ruler sent a detachment of 3,000 cavalry, commanded by Ivan the Russian, from Yambol to guard the Imperial Palace in Constantinople and Andronikos II but his intentions were to capture the old emperor and the city. Forewarned by his grandson, Andronikos II prudently kept the Bulgarians away from the capital and his person. When Michael Shishman understood that his plans were revealed he sent Ivan a letter with a single feather to retreat which meant that the orders had to be promptly executed.\n\nFollowing the victory of Andronikos III over his grandfather, Michael Shishman attempted to gain some lands by force. He invaded Thrace in June 1328 and pillaged the vicinities of Viza but retreated before the advance of Andronikos III. Another showdown in front of Adrianople 60 days later ended without battle and with the renewal of the peace treaty in October 1328, after which Michael Shishman returned to his country, but not before securing a large payoff. In return, the Bulgarians gave back the fortress of Bukelon which they had taken during the initial stages of the campaign. In the beginning of the next year the Bulgarian emperor requested a personal meeting with his Byzantine counterpart to negotiate a definitive treaty and joint military operations against the growing power of Serbia. In the locality known as \"Krimni\" between Sozopol and Anchialus the two signed \"lasting peace and eternal alliance\".\n\nThe divorce with Anna Neda in 1324 worsened the relations between Bulgaria and Serbia which had been cordial since the beginning of the 14th century. Anna Neda had to leave the capital Tarnovo with her sons and sought refuge from her brother Stephen Dečanski, the king of Serbia. Dečanski, who was engaged in war against his cousin Stephen Vladislav II, was in no position to oppose Michael Shishman. The Bulgarian emperor even acknowledged his rival as King of Serbia but his help to Vladislav was insufficient. In the spring of 1324 Dečanski sent the future Serbian archbishop Danilo II to negotiate with the Bulgarian emperor in Tarnovo but his mission was inconclusive. The two countries were again on the opposite sides in the Byzantine civil war when the Bulgarians allied with Andronikos III while the Serbs supported his grandfather.\n\nAfter the agreement with Andronikos III in 1329, Michael Shishman started preparations to attack while the Serbs were pillaging the areas around Ohrid. According to the Serbian chroniclers, he arrogantly demanded the submission of the Serbian king and threatened to \"set up his throne in the middle of the Serbian land\". In 1330, expecting to join the army of Andronikos III advancing from the south, Michael Shishman marched on Serbia with a large force of 15,000 troops, including reinforcements from his vassals and allies from Wallachia and Moldavia. At first he headed to Vidin, where historians believe he wanted to join forces with the soldiers of his brother Belaur, and then marched to the south. Due to poor coordination with the Byzantines, the Bulgarian army met the Serbs, whose army numbered 15,000 men as well, alone near Velbazhd (Kyustendil). On a personal meeting, the two rulers agreed to a one-day truce as both were expecting reinforcements. Backed on the agreement, Michael Shishman allowed his army to disperse in search for provisions. However, in the morning of 28 July, the main Serbian reinforcements, 1,000 heavily armed Catalan horsemen under the command of the King's son Stephen Dušan arrived, and the Serbs broke their word and attacked the Bulgarians. Despite the unexpected assault, Michael Shishman tried to bring his army to order but it was too late and the Serbs were victorious. The outcome of the battle shaped the balance of power in the Balkans for the next decades to come and although Bulgaria did not lose territory, the Serbs could occupy much of Macedonia.\n\nThe circumstances around the death of Michael Shishman are unclear. According to the Byzantine emperor and historian John Kantakouzenos the emperor was mortally wounded in the battle and soon died while another Byzantine historian suggests that Michael Shishman lived for three more days not able to gain consciousness and died on the fourth day. The Serbian chronicles state that his horse fell during the battle and crashed his body. When his body was taken to Dečanski, he mourned him but pointed out that he preferred war to peace. The early 15th-century Bulgarian scholar and cleric Gregory Tsamblak says that Michael Shishman was captured and killed by the son of the Serbian king, Stephen Dušan. He was buried in the Church of St George in Staro Nagoričane.\n\nMichael Shishman is considered a vain, aggressive, and opportunistic ruler, whose Protean foreign policy perhaps contributed to the battle that put an end to his life. At the same time he was clearly forceful and energetic, overcoming and reversing Bulgaria's losses during the uncertainty that preceded his accession, and managing to maintain internal peace and security within Bulgaria during his short reign. Andreev calls him the most remarkable 14th-century Bulgarian monarch. According to Kantacouzenos he desired to expand the country from Byzantium to the Istros, i. e. from Constantinople to the Danube which makes him the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who effectively attempted to capture the Byzantine capital. He was also the first Bulgarian ruler for decades who tried to lead a more active policy in Macedonia. Michael Shishman's seal is depicted on the reverse of the Bulgarian 2 levs banknote, issued in 1999 and 2005.\n\nMichael Shishman was married first to Anna Neda of Serbia, a daughter of Stefan Uroš II Milutin of Serbia. By this marriage he had several children, including Ivan Stefan, who succeeded as emperor of Bulgaria (r. 1330-1331), Michael who ruled shortly as despot of Vidin and Shishman. By his second marriage to Theodora Palaiologina, Empress of Bulgaria, a daughter of Michael IX Palaiologos of Byzantium, Michael Shishman had several children whose names are unknown.\n\n\n\n"}

They became valuable trade items during the Musket Wars of the early 19th century.\n\nMoko facial tattoos were traditional in Māori culture until about the mid 19th century when their use began to disappear, although there has been something of a revival from the late 20th century. In pre-European Māori culture they denoted high social status. There were generally only men that had full facial moko, though high-ranked women often had moko on their lips and chins. Moko tattoos served as identifying connection between an individual and their ancestors.\n\nMoko marked rites of passage for people of chiefly rank, as well as significant events in their lives. Each moko was unique and contained information about the person’s rank, tribe, lineage, occupation and exploits. Moko were expensive to obtain and elaborate moko were usually limited to chiefs and high-ranked warriors. Moreover, the art of moko, the people who created and incised the designs, as well as the moko themselves, were surrounded by strict tapu and protocol.\n\nWhen someone with moko died, often the head would be preserved. The brain and eyes were removed, with all orifices sealed with flax fibre and gum. The head was then boiled or steamed in an oven before being smoked over an open fire and dried in the sun for several days. It was then treated with shark oil. Such preserved heads, mokomokai, would be kept by their families in ornately carved boxes and brought out only for sacred ceremonies.\n\nThe heads of enemy chiefs killed in battle were also preserved; these mokomokai, being considered trophies of war, would be displayed on the marae and mocked. They were important in diplomatic negotiations between warring tribes, with the return and exchange of mokomokai being an essential precondition for peace.\n\nIn the early 19th century, with the arrival of Europeans in New Zealand, tribes in contact with European sailors, traders and settlers had access to firearms, giving them a military advantage over their neighbours. This gave rise to the Musket Wars, when other tribes became desperate to acquire firearms too, if only to defend themselves. During this period of social destabilisation, mokomokai became commercial trade items that could be sold as curios, artworks and as museum specimens which fetched high prices in Europe and America, and which could be bartered for firearms and ammunition.\n\nThe demand for firearms was such that tribes carried out raids on their neighbours to acquire more heads to trade for them. They also tattooed slaves and prisoners (though with meaningless motifs rather than genuine moko) in order to provide heads to order. The peak years of the trade in mokomokai were from 1820 to 1831. In 1831 the Governor of New South Wales issued a proclamation banning further trade in heads out of New Zealand, and during the 1830s the demand for firearms diminished because of market saturation. By 1840 when the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, and New Zealand became a British colony, the export trade in mokomokai had virtually ended, along with a decline in the use of moko in Māori society, although occasional small-scale trade continued for several years.\n\nMajor-General Horatio Gordon Robley was a British army officer and artist who served in New Zealand during the New Zealand land wars in the 1860s. He was interested in ethnology and fascinated by the art of tattooing as well as being a talented illustrator. He wrote the classic text on the subject of moko, \"Moko; or Maori Tattooing\", which was published in 1896. After he returned to England he built up a notable collection of 35–40 mokomokai which he later offered to sell to the New Zealand Government. When the offer was declined, most of the collection was sold to the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nMore recently there has been a campaign to repatriate to New Zealand the hundreds of mokomokai held in museums and private collections around the world, either to be returned to their relatives or to the Museum of New Zealand for storage, though not display. It has had some success, though many mokomokai remain overseas and the campaign is ongoing.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2122523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122523", "title": "Moral luck", "text": "Moral luck\n\nMoral luck describes circumstances whereby a moral agent is assigned moral blame or praise for an action or its consequences even if it is clear that said agent did not have full control over either the action or its consequences. This term, introduced by Bernard Williams, has been developed, along with its significance to a coherent moral theory, by Williams and Thomas Nagel in their respective essays on the subject.\n\nBroadly speaking, human beings tend to correlate, at least intuitively, responsibility and voluntary action. Thus, the most blame is assigned to persons for their actions and the consequences they entail when we have good cause to believe that both:\n\nConversely, there is a tendency to be much more sympathetic to those who satisfy any of the following conditions:\n\nParenthetically, the above criteria do not correlate exactly with moral praise – while it may be true that one can, and should assign a good deal of moral praise to those who had performed a good action, or an action entailing good consequences, completely on their own volition and uncoerced, it is debatable that the same distinction holds for involuntary actions that happened to turn out well or happened to produce good outcomes.\n\nThis correlation between responsibility and voluntary action is acceptable to most people on an intuitive level; indeed, this correlation is echoed in American and European law: for this reason, for example, manslaughter, or killing in self-defense carries a significantly different type of legal punishment (i.e., formalized moral blame) than premeditated murder.\n\nGiven the notion of equating moral responsibility with voluntary action, however, moral luck leads to counterintuitive solutions. This is illustrated by an example of a traffic accident. Driver A, in a moment of inattention, runs a red light as a child is crossing the street. Driver A tries to avoid hitting the child but fails and the child dies. Driver B also runs a red light, but no one is crossing and only gets a traffic ticket. \n\nIf a bystander is asked to morally evaluate Drivers A and B, they may assign Driver A more moral blame than Driver B because Driver A's course of action resulted in a death. However, there are no differences in the controllable actions performed by Drivers A and B. The only disparity is an external uncontrollable event. If it is given that moral responsibility should only be relevant when the agent voluntarily performed or failed to perform some action, Drivers A and B should be blamed equally. This may be intuitively problematic, as one situation resulted in a death.\n\nThomas Nagel (1979) identified four kinds of moral luck in his essay. The kind most relevant to the above example is \"resultant moral luck\".\n\nResultant moral luck concerns the consequences of actions and situations. In the above example, both drivers were affected by resultant moral luck in that a particular set of circumstances turned out in two different ways: in one situation, a pedestrian appeared on the road; in the other, the pedestrian did not.\n\nCircumstantial moral luck concerns the surroundings of the moral agent. The best-known example is provided in Nagel's essay. Consider Nazi followers and supporters in Hitler's Germany. They were and are worthy of moral blame either for committing morally reprehensible deeds or for allowing them to occur without making efforts to oppose them. But, if in 1929, those people were moved to some other country, away from the coming hostilities by their employers, it is quite possible that they would have led very different lives, and we could not assign the same amount of moral blame to them. It is down, then, to the luck of the circumstances in which they find themselves.\n\nConstitutive moral luck concerns the personal character of a moral agent. There can be little argument that education, upbringing, genes and other largely uncontrollable influences shape personality to some extent. Furthermore, one's personality dictates one's actions to some extent. Moral blame is assigned to an individual for being extremely selfish, even though that selfishness is almost certainly due in part to external environmental effects.\n\nCausal moral luck, which equates largely with the problem of free will, is the least-detailed of the varieties that Thomas Nagel describes. The general definition is that actions are determined by external events and are thus consequences of events over which the person taking the action has no control. Since people are restricted in their choice of actions by the events that precede them, they should not be held accountable or responsible for such actions.\n\nThomas Nagel has been criticized by Dana Nelkin for including causal moral luck as a separate category, since it appears largely redundant. It does not cover any cases that are not already included in constitutive and circumstantial luck, and seems to exist only for the purpose of bringing up the problem of free will.\n\nSome philosophers, such as Susan Wolf, have tried to come up with \"happy mediums\" that strike a balance between rejecting moral luck outright and accepting it wholesale. Wolf introduced the notions of rationalist and irrationalist positions as part of such a reconciliation.\n\nThe rationalist position, stated simply, is that equal fault deserves equal blame. For example, given two drivers, both of whom failed to check their brakes before driving, one of them runs over a pedestrian as a consequence while the other does not. The rationalist would say that since both of the drivers were equally at fault in failing to check their brakes, it should make no difference that one of them was lucky in not hitting a pedestrian while the other was unlucky – moral fault is independent of consequence. Since the fault here is equal, the agents should receive equal blame.\n\nThe consequentialist position argues that equal fault need not deserve equal blame, as blame should depend on the consequences. By this logic, the lucky driver certainly does not deserve as much blame as the unlucky driver, even though their faults were identical.\n\nWolf combines these two approaches in trying to reconcile the tensions associated with moral luck by introducing the concept of a virtuous agent. A virtuous agent should accept that they have a special connection with the consequences of their actions, including equal-fault cases (such as the lucky/unlucky drivers above), and even in no-fault cases. This argument essentially retains the rationalist claim that equal fault is equally deserving of blame while also retaining the consequentialist claim that different outcomes should result in moral agents feeling and acting differently.\n\nIt is important to underline the distinction between internal and external moral blame or praise. Wolf believes that the outsiders should blame the lucky and unlucky drivers equally despite their intuition that the two of them should not feel equally bad (i.e., the unlucky driver that ran over a pedestrian should feel worse). \"However\", the unlucky driver themselves should voluntarily accept the notion of the special connection between their actions and the unfortunate consequences, and assign more blame to themselves than the lucky driver should.\n\n\n\n"}

Lindgren wrote of the attraction of predicting and planning for economic collapse:\nLike real porn, the economic variety gives you the illusion of control, and similarly it only leaves you hungry for more. But econo-porn also feeds a powerful sense of intellectual vanity. You walk the streets feeling superior to all these heedless knaves who have no clue what’s coming down the pike. By making yourself miserable about the frightful hell that awaits us, you feel better. Pessimism can be bliss too.\nThe change in programming of news channels to infotainment has played a role in the spread of pessimism porn. Instead of news programming designed to put the issues of the day in a context understandable to viewers, stories follow an \"if it bleeds it leads\" priority that increase people's fear and anxiety followed by advertisements that offer a way to soothe those anxieties, such as ones for companies for investing in gold to hedge against economic collapse. \n\nThomas P.M. Barnett, chief analyst at Wikistrat, has criticized apocalyptic predictions for the global economy as problematically short-sighted because \"human history is progress, so if you're constantly having to screen out the good to spot the bad, your vision will be unduly narrow...you must consistently discount advances as 'illusions' and 'buying time' and so on, and after a while, you're just this broken clock who's dead-on twice a day\".\n\nIn her book \"Apocalypse and Post-Politics: The Romance of the End\", Regent University professor Mary Manjikian linked Lindgren's concept of pessimism porn to Frank Kermode's \"eschatological anxiety\", which he wrote about in his landmark \"The Sense of an Ending\". Kermode argued that \"worrying about the apocalypse is actually a feature of societies undergoing significant social and technological transitions\".\n\nPurveyors of pessimism porn tend to cite as examples of an approaching economic Armageddon the scenario of the world, particularly the Chinese, giving up on the dollar as a reserve currency; movements such as Occupy Wall Street; and the collapse of the European Union and the Euro. Mainstream economists usually disregard the econometrics of people who forecast the collapse of society and the need to resort to survivalism because of what they perceive as the imminent end of the western financial model. \n\nLindgren cited the blog Calculated Risk as a \"reliable turn-on\" for its author's knack for writing about the dangers of plummeting rates for various goods, such as commercial paper. Peter Schiff and trend forecaster Gerald Celente were singled out by ABC News as purveyors of pessimism porn. Celente has predicted that in 2012 the United States will see food riots, shantytowns in Central Park and \"economic martial law\", and that the only protections from the chaos to come are \"the three g's—gold, guns and a get-away plan\". Alex Pareene called Nouriel Roubini the \"Joe Francis of Pessimism Porn\" for writing multiple doomsday columns for major publications, including a February 2009 column in the \"Washington Post\" declaring that unless the U.S. government seized and nationalized all banks the system would collapse.\n\n"}
{"id": "810810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=810810", "title": "Pokémon Emerald", "text": "Pokémon Emerald\n\nThe gameplay and controls are mostly unchanged from previous games in the series; players control a Pokémon trainer from an overhead perspective. As with previous games, the player's general goal is to traverse the Hoenn region and conquer a series of eight Pokémon gyms in order to challenge the Elite Four and its champion, while the main subplot is to defeat two criminal organizations attempting to harness a legendary Pokémon's power for their own goals. Along with Pokémon that debuted in \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\", the game incorporated Pokémon from \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\" not featured in \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" in the post-game.\n\n\"Emerald\"'s reception was generally positive upon release.\n\nThe gameplay in \"Emerald\" is largely the same as it was in \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\". Much of the game takes place in an overhead style; players' characters can move in four directions and can talk to other people on the overworld. Players can encounter wild Pokémon by walking into grass, surfing on their Pokémon, walking through caves, and other means. They can also fight other trainers' Pokémon. When this happens, the game shifts to a battle screen where players and their Pokémon are seen on the front-left portion of the screen while opponents are viewed on the back-right portion. Stats of the Pokémon and their trainers are shown on the side of each participant; these stats include the Pokémon's levels, the trainers' Pokémon number (which can be anywhere between one and six), the Pokémon's health, and any status effects (such as poison, paralysis, burn, sleep, and freeze). Trainers send out the first Pokémon in their party and they take turns attacking where the first strike is determined usually by the speed of the two Pokémon. Players can choose from one of four options: Fight, Bag, Switch, and Run. Each Pokémon has 1-4 different moves that they can use, which have different effects, number of uses, and types (such as Grass, Psychic, etc.). When a Pokémon hits 0 HP, they faint, forcing the Pokémon's trainer to switch out. Once one trainer runs out of Pokémon, the battle is ended. When a human-controlled Pokémon wins a battle, the Pokémon gains experience. Enough experience will earn that Pokémon a higher level, which grants upgraded stats (which includes attack, speed, defense, special attack, special defense, and health) and sometimes grant new moves.\n\nCertain battles allow for two-on-two combat; certain moves were designed to support partners while other moves are capable of attacking two or more Pokémon. Unlike \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" which had you fight two specific trainers, \"Emerald\" allowed for you to have a 2-on-2 battle with two trainers both of whom you could usually battle separately. Every Pokémon has an ability that often aides in battle, such as abilities that make a Pokémon more powerful if they are close to fainting. Wild Pokémon encountered by players can be captured using items called Poké Balls, which have a greater chance of success the weaker the wild Pokémon is. Players can battle and trade with other players by linking their copies of \"Emerald\" with other Game Boy Advance games (which include \"Ruby\", \"Sapphire\", \"FireRed\", and \"LeafGreen\"). This can be accomplished either by using a Game Boy Advance link cable or by use of the wireless adapter that was bundled with \"FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\". It is also compatible with \"\". This allows players to trade for Pokémon not normally obtained in \"Emerald\".\n\nAside from the traditional battle and overworld style, players' Pokémon are able to participate in Pokémon Contests where they can try and win in five different contest categories: \"Cool\", \"Beauty\", \"Cute\", \"Smart\", and \"Tough\" competitions. The players' characters are given a device early on called the PokéNav, which allows players to view the world map, check their Pokémon's contest stats, and make and receive phone calls with trainers that they have met with whom they can chat or plan a battle. This replaces a function called \"Trainer's Eyes\", which allows players to register certain trainers and see when they are in the mood to battle. This also allows players to rebattle Gym Leaders, an ability not found in previous Pokémon games. \"Emerald\" includes several other new features and changes. It includes animations of Pokémon in-battle (which was not present in \"Ruby\" or \"Sapphire\") and an area called the Battle Frontier. It is an expansion of the Battle Tower found in previous games. A man whom players encounter several times throughout the game will eventually allow them to access the Battle Frontier after beating the Pokémon League Champion. The Battle Frontier features the aforementioned Battle Tower in addition to six new areas. Completing these areas awards players with \"Battle Points\" which can be spent on prizes to use in and out of battle. The Japanese version featured compatibility with the Nintendo e-Reader; however, this was cut for the English release due to its lack of success. \"Emerald\" features the Trainer Hill area which, in the Japanese version, is compatible with the e-Reader. Rare Pokémon that originated from earlier \"Pokémon\" games such as Mew, Lugia, and Ho-Oh were made available through an in-game event.\n\nThe setting and plot remains largely the same as \"Pokémon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\". Players can choose between either a boy or girl, both of whom have been given new outfits with a green color scheme, and one of three Pokémon before they proceed from their hometown into the rest of the game's world. \n\nPlayers are tasked with filling their Pokédex by catching different Pokémon species and evolving them. They are also tasked to complete eight gym challenges and defeat the Elite Four and its champion by battling their Pokémon. Along the way, they make two rivals: May/Brendan, the child of the Pokémon Professor Birch, and Wally, a sickly child from Petalburg who the player assists in catching his first Pokémon, a Ralts. They also encounter Steven, the Hoenn Region's Champion.\n\nAlong their journey they face both Team Magma and Team Aqua, who originally could only be faced in \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\", respectively. Both have a goal to change the world they believe will benefit Pokémon—Magma desiring to expand the landmass and Aqua desiring to expand the sea—and both plan to accomplish their respective goals by summoning the legendary Pokémon Groudon and Kyogre. Both teams make repeated efforts to alter the landscape. Team Magma attempts to make a volcano erupt and Team Aqua tries to steal a weather-altering Pokémon. \n\nBetween the player's visit to the seventh and eighth gyms, both teams summon their respective legendary Pokémon with mystical orbs stolen from Mt. Pyre; however, the Pokémon refuse to obey either team and begin fighting, which puts the world in a constantly switching state of droughts and heavy rainfalls. The player climbs a tower in order to summon the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza, who quells the other two Pokémon's rage.\n\nAfter the player beats the Elite Four, they are able to encounter two Pokémon flying across Hoenn called Latias and Latios, and can access an area called the Battle Frontier, which adds several new challenges for the player.\n\n\"Emerald\" was developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. It was first announced in \"Coro Coro Magazine\". It features compatibility with the Nintendo e-Reader and 83 cards launched for \"Emerald\" on October 7, 2004. This was removed from the English versions. It is the third version of \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" and follows a tradition of third releases (\"Pokémon Yellow\" for \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\" for example). The wireless adapter was bundled with Japanese copies of \"Emerald\"; this was removed from English versions of the game.\n\nNintendo has done several promotions related to \"Emerald\". Nintendo held a competition for players based on \"Emerald\" where players compete to be the \"\"Pokémon Emerald\" Ultimate Frontier Battle Brain\". The competition took place in seven areas across the United States and Canada, where 14 finalists (two from each area) competed in Seattle, Washington's Space Needle for a trip for two to the Pokémon Park in Nagoya, Japan. People could also enter to win a trip to the Space Needle to watch the competition. The competition centered around trivia about characters from Pokémon and their abilities. Nintendo also introduced a pre-order program that would give those who pre-ordered the game exclusive access to a \"Pokémon\" website, a collector's tin holder, and a guide to the Battle Frontier. A limited edition Game Boy Advance SP was released by Nintendo which featured a silhouette of the Pokémon Rayquaza. It was distributed by Nintendo in Japan exclusively on their website \"Pokémon Trainer Online\" and was never released outside of Japan. It was featured in the \"Official Nintendo Magazine\"s list of rare \"Pokémon\" consoles. Players who brought their Game Boy Advance with a copy of \"Emerald\" and a wireless adapter to Booth 2029 of the 2005 Comic-Con International would be given an in-game item called the Mystic Ticket which allows players the opportunity to capture Lugia and Ho-oh.\n\n\"Emerald\" launched in the top spot in Japan with 791,000 copies sold in its first week and 372,000 copies sold in its first day. It was the fourth best-selling game in Japan for 2004. It sold 1.4 million for the year and ranked behind \"\", \"Pokémon FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\" (combined), and \"\". The list of the top 1000 best-selling video games in Japan for 2010 featured \"Emerald\" at 779 with 7,724 copies sold for a total of 1,916,505 sold since release. It was the only Game Boy Advance game on the list. More than 146,000 people pre-ordered copies of \"Emerald\" in the US. \"Emerald\" launched in the United States at the number one position in May; it followed in June by falling to the number two spot below \"\" on Xbox with 265,000 copies sold in that month. It was the second best-selling game for the first half of 2005. In a poll conducted by IGN, readers ranked \"Emerald\" as the most popular Game Boy Advance game for the 2005 Holiday season. It ranked second for the whole year of 2005 below \"Madden NFL 06\". By the end of 2005 it had sold 1.2 million in Europe and nearly 5 million worldwide. It had sold 1.72 million copies worldwide by June 1, 2005. It had sold 5 million worldwide by the end of 2005. To date it is one of the three best-selling Game Boy Advance games. Its life-to-date sales totaled 6.32 million by the 2007 fiscal year. In November 2005, \"Nintendo Power\" erroneously reported that \"Total sales [from \"Emerald\"] would exceed the value of an actual emerald the size of Neptune.\"\n\n\"Pokémon Emerald Version\" received generally positive reception. It received average scores of 76/100 and 76.65% on Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. It received an award for excellence at the ninth annual CESA game awards. IGN's Craig Harris stated that while he was not enthused by \"Emerald\", he admitted that it was a solid game and that it was the best version to get for people who hadn't played \"Ruby\" or \"Sapphire\" yet. 1UP.com's Christian Nutt felt that it was the definitive version of \"Pokémon\" at the time yet was also a rehash. GameSpy's Phil Theobald felt that it was a good game in its own right but felt like the same game as \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\". GameSpot's Ryan Davis noted that it was a quality experience despite being similar to \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" and that hardcore fans may appreciate its changes. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas bemoaned the fact that he had to play through the whole game before he could play the Battle Frontier. Eurogamer's Corey Brotherson felt that it was a good game in its own right but was lacking in compelling additions. He added however that it was a better game for players new to the series. Nintendo Life's Laurie Blake performed a retroactive review of \"Emerald\"; she felt that the \"Pokémon\" games have aged well but still feel like they did in 1996. She further stated that the similarities between it and \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" prevented it from being a must-have while still being good. Allgame's Julia Reges felt that the game had a lot of value for younger players but that older players may be disinterested. She compared Nintendo's remakes of the \"Pokémon\" games to the various \"Star Wars\" remakes.\n\nIGN's Audrey Drake praised the game for utilizing both of the villain groups and called it a \"marked departure\" from \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\". She felt that the ability to re-battle Gym Leaders created an \"exciting challenge\" for players. She also included \"Emerald\" (alongside \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\") in a list of Game Boy Advance games that she wanted to see on the Nintendo 3DS' eShop. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish listed \"Emerald\" as one of the best games to bring onto a plane. Fellow 1UP.com editor Kat Bailey included it in her list of remakes that \"left the originals in the dust\". She praised the Battle Frontier and its fixes for flaws found in \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\".\n\n"}
{"id": "544223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=544223", "title": "Public humiliation", "text": "Public humiliation\n\nPublic humiliation or public shaming is a form of punishment whose main feature is dishonoring or disgracing a person, usually an offender or a prisoner, especially in a public place. It was regularly used as a form of judicially sanctioned punishment in previous centuries, and is still practiced by different means in the modern era.\n\nIn the United States, it was a common punishment from the beginning of European colonization through the 19th century. It fell out of common use in the 20th century, though it has seen a revival starting in the 1990s.\n\nPublic humiliation exists in many forms. Most often a criminal was placed in the center of town and having the local populace enact a form of \"mob justice\" on the individual. \n\nThe punishment of public humiliation could be, amongst other things, an offender being forced to relate his crime, such as by exaggerated physical parody: a 'shame flute' for a bad musician or wearing a giant rosary (, \"stones of shame\") for someone late to church. The offender could alternatively be sentenced to remain exposed in a specific public place, in a restraining device.\n\nIn the Low Countries, the (\"Chair of shame\"), the or (\"pole of shame\", a simple type of pillory), the were customary for adulteresses, and the , a scaffolding from which one is kicked off to land in mud and dirt.\n\nIn the more extreme cases being subjected to verbal and physical abuse from the crowd, which could have serious consequences especially when the hands are not free to protect himself. Some sentences actually prescribe additional humiliation, such as shaving, or combine it with painful corporal punishments, see below.\n\nIn Colonial America, common forms of public humiliation were the stocks and pillory, imported from Europe. Nearly every sizable town had such instruments of public humiliation, usually at the town square. Historic public humiliation displays can still be seen in the historic Virginia town of Colonial Williamsburg.In pre–World War Japan, adulterers were publicly exposed purely to shame them.\n\nIn post-Colonial times, judicial use of public humiliation punishment has largely fallen out of favor since the practice is now considered cruel and unusual punishment, which is outlawed in the United States Constitution.\n\nIn Siam, an adulteress was paraded with a hibiscus behind the ear. Thieves were tattooed on their faces. Other criminals were paraded with a device made of woven cane on the forehead, or lengths of bamboo hung around the neck. Errant Brahmans had to wear a string of oversize beads.\n\nJust like painful forms of corporal punishment, it has parallels in educational and other rather private punishments (but with some audience), in school or domestic disciplinary context, and as a rite of passage. Physical forms include being forced to wear some sign such as \"donkey ears\" (simulated in paper, as a sign one is—or at least behaved—proverbially stupid), wearing a dunce cap, having to stand, kneel or bend over in a corner, or repeatedly write something on a blackboard (\"I will not spread rumors\", for example). Here different levels of physical discomfort can be added, such as having to hold heavy objects, go barefoot (see below) or kneel on an uneven surface. Like physical punishment and harsh hazing, these have become controversial in most modern societies, in many cases leading to legal restrictions and/or (sometimes voluntary) abolishment.Having the head shaved can be a humiliating punishment prescribed in law, but also something done as \"mob justice\" - a stark example of which was the thousands of European women who had their heads shaved in front of cheering crowds in the wake of World War II, as punishment for associating with occupying Nazis during the war.Forcing people to go barefoot has been used as a relatively effortless and more subtle form of humiliation in most past and present civilized cultures, primarily using the visual contrast to the standard form of appearance while also creating some level of physical discomfort. The exposure of bare feet often served as an indicator for imprisonment and slavery throughout ancient as well as modern history. Even today prisoners officially have to go barefoot in many countries of the world and are also presented in court and showcased to the public unshod. As shoes are commonly worn by all social classes since antiquity in most civilized societies, showcasing a captive to the public in bare feet traditionally symbolizes the person's loss of social standing and personal autonomy. It usually also causes a considerable degree of humiliation, as this noticeable detail typically sets the prisoner apart from spectators visually and demonstrates the person's vulnerability and general powerlessness.\n\nFurther means of public humiliation and degradation consist in forcing people to wear typifying clothes, which can be penitential garbs or prison uniforms.\n\nPresenting arrestees or prisoners to the public in restraints (such as handcuffs, shackles or similar devices) also serves as a convenient method of public humiliation besides the primary security aspects. The effect is complemented by presenting the person in a prison uniform or similar clothing.\n\nApart from specific methods essentially aiming at humiliation, several methods combine pain and humiliation or even death and humiliation. In some cases, pain or at least discomfort is insignificant or rather secondary to the humiliation.\n\nThe simplest is to administer painful corporal punishment in public - the major aim may be deterrence of potential offenders - so the public will witness the perpetrator's fear and agony. This can either take place in a town square or other public gathering location such as a school, or take the form of a procession through the streets. This was not uncommon in the sentences to \"Staupenschlag\" (whipping or birching, generally on the bare buttocks) in various German-speaking states, till the 19th century. A naval equivalent was Flogging round the fleet on a raft taken from ship to ship for consecutive installments of a great total of lashes, that could even be lethal. In some countries the punishment of foot whipping is executed in public to this day.\n\nThe humiliation can be extended; intentionally or not; by leaving visible marks, such as scars, notably on body parts that are normally left visible. This also serves as a virtually indelible criminal record. This can even be the main intention of the punishment, as in the case of scarifications, such as branding. It invariably is essential in forms of mutilation, such as ear cropping, though the functional loss is even greater; pain may even be intentionally minimized as in the case of surgical amputation, eliminating the risk of accidental death. Tarring and feathering also serves as means of extended humiliation.\n\nPublic shaming can result in negative psychological effects and devastating consequences, regardless of the punishment being justifiable or not. It could cause depression, suicidal thoughts and other severe mental problems. The humiliated individuals may develop a variety of symptoms including apathy, paranoia, anxiety, PTSD, etc. The rage and fury may arise in the persecuted individual, themselves lashing out against innocent victims, as they seek revenge or as a means of release.\n\n"}

{"id": "53839151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53839151", "title": "Transcranial random noise stimulation", "text": "Transcranial random noise stimulation\n\nTranscranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique and a form of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). Terney et al from Göttingen University was the first group to apply tRNS in humans in 2008. They showed that by using an alternate current along with random amplitude and frequency (between 0.1 and 640 Hz) in healthy subjects, the motor cortex excitability increased (i.e. increased amplitude of motor evoked potentials) for up to 60 minutes after 10 minutes of stimulation. The study included all the frequencies up to half of the sampling rate (1280 samples/s) i.e. 640 Hz, however the positive effect was limited only to higher frequencies. Although tRNS has shown positive effects in various studies the optimal parameters, as well as the potential clinical effects of this technique, remain unclear.\n\nThe physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of tRNS are not well known, however many hypotheses have been suggested.\nThe robust changes in cortical excitability observed after tRNS could be attributed to the repeated opening of sodium channels or to the increased sensitivity of neuronal networks to modulation. tRNS may influence cortical oscillations, leading to changes in excitability. These proposed mechanisms are consistent with the observation that reversing electrode polarities in tRNS does not interfere with the augmentation in cortical excitability, suggesting that tRNS-induced cortical excitability is independent of current flow direction.\n\nSince tRNS is a repetitive, random, and subthreshold stimulation, it is speculated that tRNS induces direct temporal summation of neural activity because the time constant of a neuron is sufficiently long to permit the summation of two stimuli presented in close succession.\n\nThe effects of tRNS may also be explained in the context of the stochastic resonance phenomenon. tRNS is, by definition, a stimulation that induces non-finalized random activity in the system (i.e., noise). The presence of neuronal noise might enhance the sensitivity of the neurons to a given range of weak inputs.\n\nTranscranial electrical stimulation (tES) generally includes the following techniques:\n\ntRNS stimulation differs from tDCS in that instead of constant direct current delivery, current levels are \"randomly\" generated, with a normal distribution around a specific mean intensity. Other parameters related to the stimulation electrodes, like position and size, are similar to tDCS.\nCompared to tDCS, tRNS has also the advantage of being more comfortable, which makes it potentially advantageous for setting and blinding studies.\ntRNS is easier to blind than tDCS with the 50% perception threshold for tDCS at 400 µA while this threshold was at 1200 µA in the case of tRNS.\n\ntACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation) is a frequency-specific stimulation method that is also thought to influence oscillatory neuronal activity. This method differs from tRNS in that a sinusoidal current is applied at a fixed frequency rather than a randomly presented range of frequencies. Often, tACS is applied at frequencies that mirror the predominant frequency bands observed in EEG in different regions of the brain.\n\n"}

It should be stressed that the success of such a technique is highly dependent on the specific situation.

He was born in San Francisco, California to Gum Yung Sen and his first wife, both immigrants from China.\n\nWhen his mother died during the flu epidemic of 1919, his father placed Victor and his younger sister, Rosemary, in a children's shelter, and returned to his homeland to seek another wife. His father returned in 1922, with his new wife Lovi Shee, once again forming a household with his two children. During his acting career, Victor was given billing under a variety of names, including Sen Yung, Sen Young, Victor Sen Young, and Victor Young.\n\nSen Yung made his first significant acting debut in the 1938 film \"Charlie Chan in Honolulu\", as the Chinese detective's \"number two son,\" Jimmy Chan. In this movie, Sidney Toler replaced the recently deceased Warner Oland as Charlie Chan and Sen Yung replaced Oland's \"number one son\" Lee, who had been played by Keye Luke. Sen Yung played Jimmy Chan in 10 Charlie Chan films between 1938 and 1942. He played the crucial role of lawyer's clerk Ong Chi Seng alongside Bette Davis in \"The Letter\" (1940).\n\nIn common with other Chinese-American actors, Sen Yung was cast in Japanese parts during World War II, such as his role as the treacherous Japanese-American Joe Totsuiko in the 1942 Humphrey Bogart film \"Across the Pacific\".\n\nDuring World War II, he joined the U.S. Army Air Forces. During his military service, he was replaced in the Charlie Chan series by Benson Fong, who played \"number three son\", Tommy Chan. Yung's military service included work in training films at the First Motion Picture Unit and a role in the Army Air Forces' play and film \"Winged Victory\".\n\nAfter the war, Sen Yung resumed his Hollywood career. The Charlie Chan series was now in the hands of Monogram Pictures, with Sidney Toler continuing in the leading role. Toler's health was failing by 1946; author Scott MacGillivray contends that Monogram was conserving Toler's energy and shooting around him wherever possible, even reusing two-year-old footage to finish Toler's last film. To relieve the burden on Toler, Monogram hired his original screen foil, Sen Yung (now billing himself as Victor Sen Young). He and Mantan Moreland shared the spotlight in Toler's final two films, \"Shadows over Chinatown\" and \"The Trap\".\n\nFollowing Toler's death in 1947, Victor Sen Young continued to work in motion pictures but also moved into television, playing affable or earnest Asian characters. He is probably best remembered as Hop Sing, the cook on the long-running television series \"Bonanza\", appearing in 102 episodes between 1959 and 1973.\n\nSen Yung was cast as the compassionate Chinese restaurant owner, Quong Kee, in Tombstone, Arizona, in the 1957 episode, \"Quong Kee\", of the syndicated television anthology series, \"Death Valley Days\", hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, an aging Quong Kee recalls how in 1881 he brought together the Bostonians Art Gresham (Walter Kelley) and his mother, played by Mary Newton, with the saloon musician Ann Bailey (Eugenia Paul), who after a topsy-turvy romance became Mrs. Art Gresham.\n\nSen Yung was also an accomplished and talented chef. He frequently appeared on cooking programs, and authored \"The Great Wok Cookbook\" in 1974.\n\nIn 1972, Yung was on Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 710, which was hijacked. The FBI stormed the plane, and in the ensuing gunfire Sen Yung was shot in the small of the back. He and another wounded passenger survived, but a third passenger and the two hijackers were killed.\n\nIn 1975, he appeared on Garry Moore's \"To Tell The Truth\" show and related the events of the hijacking. With Yung dressed in a sport coat and flanked by two dissimilar imposters, none of the four panelists was able to choose him as the character actor.\n\nVictor Sen Yung died under unusual circumstances in his North Hollywood home in 1980. The actor, who ran a small mail-order Chinese pottery business, was creating clayware and curing the items with an oven, and died of natural gas poisoning from a gas leak. His body was found November 10, but he had reportedly been dead at least ten days.\n\nSome reports suggested at first that the actor had been murdered, but police ultimately ruled the death accidental.\n\nThere is a memorial scholarship named after him, awarded each year by the Chinese Alumni Association of his alma mater, University of California, Berkeley, where he had majored in animal husbandry. The eulogy at his funeral was delivered by fellow \"Bonanza\" actor Pernell Roberts, who also paid the funeral expenses.\n\n"}

The events led the deaths of 3 workers, R160 million in damages as well as a 52% increase in the official minimum wage. The protests mostly took place the towns of De Doorns and Worcester with smaller protests in Ceres, Robertson, Grabouw, Wolseley and Villiersdorp. The main cause of the strikes was low worker pay of R69 (roughly US$8.54 in 2012) per day and high unemployment.\n\nThe protests began on a farm near De Doorns on 27 August 2012 when a group of largely female workers walked off the job. It then spread to other areas. It has been described as 'organic' and organised by workers without mediation by political parties, trade unions or NGOs. The strike was finally called off on 4 December 2012.\n\nAccording to the \"Mail & Guardian\" \"the fact that the protests spread so fast after decades of quiescence shocked the country.\" It has been suggested that the strike was, in part, inspired by the Marikana miners' strike which took place earlier in the year.\n\nThree protesters were killed during the strike amidst widespread claims of police brutality and intimidation of workers to join the strikes.\n\nThe strike mostly included road blockades, stoning of police, and burning vineyards but also included the intimidation of non-striking workers and damage to property (both agricultural as well as urban). The police reported that shops were also looted.\n\nA 28-year-old man, Michael Daniels, was shot dead by the police on 14 November 2012. A 40-year-old man, Bongile Ndleni, was shot dead, allegedly by a private security firm, on 17 November 2012. Amongst other reports of police violence it has been reported that a ten-year-old girl was shot in the face with a rubber bullet by the police. A police officer was injured and hospitalised by protesters when they stoned a police station. On Elim farm, near De Doorns, a pensioner, Jan Jonkers, was attacked by a protester with a machete fracturing his skull after he was mistaken for a non-striking worker.\n\nThe provincial premier Helen Zille had stones thrown at her and her delegation when they tried to address a crowd of 2,000 protesters in De Doorns forcing her, although unharmed, to leave the area.\n\nOn 14 November COSATU announced that the strike was suspended but workers continued with their strike. The next day, most farmworkers remained on strike. This led to a split between the Food and Allied Workers Union (FAWU), which is affiliated with COSATU, and the leadership of COSATU in the Western Cape with the former opting to support the farmworkers in defying COSATU's agreement with government. According to the \"Daily Maverick\", Cosatu did not have a democratic mandate to call off the strike on 4 December 2010.\n\nThe strike was resumed in January 2013. It was, again, accompanied by considerable violence by and spreading to the towns of Villiersdrop and Wolseley.\n\nIt was argued that Nosey Pieterse, the president of the Black Association of the Wine and Spirit Industry and general secretary of Bawusa, the Bawsi Agricultural Workers Union of South Africa, emerged as the primary leader in the strike in January 2013. However others have argued that the strike was largely self organised and that leaders were largely self-proclaimed. Letsekang Tokhwane, 25, was shot dead by the police on 14 January 2013. The strike was finally called off on 22 January 2013. A number of workers were fired as a result of their participation in the strike.\n\nThe strikes had an imitate impact on the daily minimum wage for agricultural workers being raised from R69 (roughly US$8.54 in 2012) per day to R105 (US$13 in 2012) per day. The event was also used as a regional campaign issue in the run up to the South African general election of 2014. Attempts to resume the strike one year later in November 2013 where unsuccessful due to a reported lack of interest by workers and well as disagreement over the necessity of striking again. The Western Cape's premier and member of the Democratic Alliance (DA), Helen Zille, stated that she believed there was a political motive for the strike with the African National Congress stoking unrest in the province to present the DA run province as \"exploitative, racist and ungovernable\".\n\n"}
