{"id": "15791844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15791844", "title": "2 base encoding", "text": "2 base encoding\n\n2 Base Encoding, also called SOLiD (sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation and detection), is a next-generation sequencing technology developed by Applied Biosystems and has been commercially available since 2008. These technologies generate hundreds of thousands of small sequence reads at one time. Well-known examples of such DNA sequencing methods include 454 pyrosequencing (introduced in 2005), the Solexa system (introduced in 2006) and the SOLiD system (introduced in 2007). These methods have reduced the cost from $0.01/base in 2004 to nearly $0.0001/base in 2006 and increased the sequencing capacity from 1,000,000 bases/machine/day in 2004 to more than 100,000,000 bases/machine/day in 2006.\n\n2-base encoding is based on ligation sequencing rather than sequencing by synthesis. However, instead of using fluorescent labeled 9-mer probes that distinguish only 6 bases, 2-base encoding takes advantage of fluorescent labeled 8-mer probes that distinguish the two 3 prime most bases but can be cycled similar to the Macevicz method, thus greater than 6bp reads can be obtained (25-50bp published, 50bp in NCBI in Feb 2008). The 2 base encoding enables reading each base twice without performing twice the work.\n\nThe general steps common to many of these next-generation sequencing techniques include:\n\n\nIn 1988, Whiteley \"et al.\" demonstrated the use of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide ligation for the detection of DNA variants. In 1995 Macevicz demonstrated repeated ligation of oligonucleotides to detect contiguous DNA variants. In 2003, Dressman \"et al.\" demonstrated the use of emulsion PCR to generate millions of clonally amplified beads which one could perform these repeated ligation assays on.\nIn 2005, Shendure \"et al.\" performed a sequencing procedure which combined Whiteley and Dressman techniques performing ligation of fluorescent labeled \"8 base degenerate\" 9-mer probes which distinguished a different base according to the probes label and non degenerate base. This process was repeated (without regenerating an extendable end as in Macevicz) using identical primers but with probes with labels which identified different non-degenerate base to sequence 6bp reads in 5->3 direction and 7bp reads in the 3->5 direction.\n\nThe SOLiD Sequencing System uses probes with dual base encoding.\n\nThe underlying chemistry is summarized in the following steps:\n\n- Step 1, Preparing a Library: This step begins with shearing the genomic DNA into small fragments. Then, two different adapters are added (for example A1 and A2). The resulting library contains template DNA fragments, which are tagged with one adapter at each end (A1-template-A2).\n\n- Step 2, Emulsion PCR: In this step, the emulsion (droplets of water suspended in oil) PCR reaction is performed using DNA fragments from library, two primers (P1 and P2) that complement to the previously used adapters (P1 with A1 and P2 with A2), other PCR reaction components and 1μm beads coupled with one of the primers (e.g. P1). make dilution from DNA library to maximize the droplet that contain one DNA fragment and one bead into a single emulsion droplet. \n\nIn each droplet, DNA template anneals to the P1-coupled bead from its A1 side. Then DNA polymerase will extend from P1 to make the complementary sequence, which eventually results in a bead enriched with PCR products from a single template. After PCR reaction, templates are denatured and disassociate from the beads. Dressman \"et al.\" first describe this technique in 2003.\n\n- Step 3, Bead Enrichment: In practice, only 30% of beads have target DNA. To increase the number of beads that have target DNA, large polystyrene beads coated with A2 are added to the solution. Thus, any bead containing the extended products will bind polystyrene bead through its P2 end. The resulting complex will be separated from untargeted beads, and melt off to dissociate the targeted beads from polystyrene. This step can increase the throughput of this system from 30% before enrichment to 80% after enrichment.\n\nAfter enrichment, the 3’-end of products (P2 end) will be modified which makes them capable of covalent bonding in the next step. Therefore, the products of this step are DNA-coupled beads with 3’-modification of each DNA strand. \n\n- Step 4, Bead Deposition: In this step, products of the last step are deposited onto a glass slide. Beads attach to the glass surface randomly through covalent bonds of the 3’-modified beads and the glass.\n\n- Step 5, Sequencing Reaction: As mentioned earlier, unlike other next-generation methods which perform sequencing through synthesis, 2-base encoding is based on sequencing by ligation. The ligation is performed using specific 8-mer probes:\n\nThese probes are eight bases in length with a free hydroxyl group at the 3’ end, a fluorescent dye at the 5’ end and a cleavage site between the fifth and sixth nucleotide. The first two bases (starting at the 3' end) are complementary to the nucleotides being sequenced. Bases 3 through 5 are degenerate and able to pair with any nucleotides on the template sequence. Bases 6-8 are also degenerate but are cleaved off, along with the fluorescent dye, as the reaction continues. Cleavage of the fluorescent dye and bases 6-8 leaves a free 5' phosphate group ready for further ligation. In this manner positions n+1 and n+2 are correctly base-paired followed by n+6 and n+7 being correctly paired, etc. The composition of bases n+3,n+4 and n+5 remains undetermined until further rounds of the sequencing reaction.\n\nThe sequencing step is basically composed of five rounds and each round consists of about 5-7 cycles (Figure 2). Each round begins with the addition of a P1-complementary universal primer. This primer has, for example, n nucleotides and its 5’-end matches exactly with the 3’-end of the P1. In each cycle, 8-mer probes are added and ligated according to their first and second bases. Then, the remaining unbound probes are washed out, the fluorescent signal from the bound probe is measured, and the bound probe is cleaved between its fifth and sixth nucleotide. Finally the primer and probes are all reset for the next round.\n\nIn the next round a new universal primer anneals the position n-1 (its 5’-end matches to the base exactly before the 3’-end of the P1) and the subsequent cycles are repeated similar to the first round. The remaining three rounds will be performed with new universal primers annealing positions n-2, n-3 and n-4 relative to the 3'-end of P1. \nA complete reaction of five rounds allows the sequencing of about 25 base pairs of the template from P1. \n\n- Step 6, Decoding Data: For decoding the data, which are represented as colors, we must first know two important factors. First, we must know that each color indicates two bases. Second, we need to know one of the bases in the sequence: this base is incorporated in the sequence in the last (fifth) round of step5. This known base is the last nucleotide of the 3’-end of the known P1. Therefore, since each color represents two nucleotides in which the second base of each dinucleotide unit constitutes the first base of the following dinucleotide, knowing just one base in the sequence will lead us to interpret the whole sequence(Figure 2).\n\nIn practice direct translation of color reads into base reads is not advised as the moment one encounters an error in the color calls it will result in a frameshift of the base calls. To best leverage the \"error correction\" properties of two base encoding it is best to convert your base reference sequence into color-space. There is one unambiguous conversion of a base reference sequence into color-space and while the reverse is also true the conversion can be wildly inaccurate if there are any sequencing errors.\n\nMapping color-space reads to a color-space reference can properly utilize the two-base encoding rules where only adjacent color differences can represent a true base polymorphism. Direct decoding or translation of the color reads into bases cannot do this efficiently without other knowledge.\n\nMore specifically, this method is not an error correction tool but an error transformation tool. Color-space transforms your most common error mode (single measurement errors) into a different frequency than your most common form of DNA variation (SNPs or single base changes). These single base changes affect adjacent colors in color space. There are logical rules which help correct adjacent errors into 'valid' and 'invalid' adjacent errors.\n\nThe likelihood of getting two adjacent errors in a 50-bp read can be estimated. There are 49 ways of making adjacent changes to a 50 letter string (50-bp read). There are 1225 ways of making non-adjacent changes to a 50 letter string (50 choose 2). Simplistically, if one assumes errors are completely random (they are usually higher frequency at the end of reads) only 49 out of 1225 errors will be candidates for SNPs. In addition, only one third of the adjacent errors can be valid errors according to the known labeling of the probes thus delivering only 16 out of 1225 errors which can be candidates for SNPs. This is particularly useful for low coverage SNP detection as it reduces false positives at low coverage, Smith \"et al.\"\n\nEach base in this sequencing method is read twice. This changes the color of two adjacent color space calls, therefore in order to miscall a SNP, two adjacent colors must be miscalled. Because of this the SNP miscall rate is on the order of e^2, where e is the device error rate.\n\nWhen base calling single color miscalls cause errors on the remaining portion of the read. In SNP calling this can be corrected, which results in a lower SNP calling error rate. However for simplistic de novo assembly you are left with the raw device error rate which will be significantly higher than the 0.06% reported for SNP calling. Quality filtering of the reads can deliver higher raw accuracy reads which when aligned to form color contigs can deliver reference sequences where 2 base encoding can be better leveraged. Hybrid assemblies with other technologies can also better utilize the 2 base encoding.\n\n"}

{"id": "46435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46435", "title": "Assassins", "text": "Assassins\n\nOrder of Assassins or simply Assassins is the common name used to refer to an Islamic sect formally known as the Nizari Ismailis. Based on texts from Alamut, their grand master Hassan-i Sabbah tended to call his disciples Asāsiyyūn (أساسيون, meaning \"people who are faithful to the foundation [of the faith]\"), but some foreign travellers like Marco Polo misunderstood the name as deriving from the term hashish.\n\nOften described as a secret order led by a mysterious \"Old Man of the Mountain\", the Nizari Ismailis formed in the late 11th century after a split within Ismailism – a branch of Shia Islam.\n\nThe Nizaris posed a strategic threat to Sunni Seljuq authority by capturing and inhabiting several mountain fortresses throughout Persia and later Syria, under the leadership of Hassan-i Sabbah. Asymmetric warfare, psychological warfare, and surgical strikes were often a tactic of the assassins, drawing their opponents into submission rather than risk killing them.\n\nWhile \"Assassins\" typically refers to the entire sect, only a group of acolytes known as the \"fida'i\" actually engaged in conflict. Lacking their own army, the Nizari relied on these warriors to carry out espionage and assassinations of key enemy figures, and over the course of 300 years successfully killed two caliphs, and many viziers, sultans, and Crusader leaders.\n\nDuring the rule of Imam Rukn-ud-Din Khurshah, the Nizari state declined internally, and was eventually destroyed as the Imam surrendered the castles to the invading Mongols. The Mongols destroyed and eliminated their Order. Mentions of Assassins were preserved within European sources – such as the writings of Marco Polo – where they are depicted as trained killers, responsible for the systematic elimination of opposing figures. The word \"assassin\" has been used ever since to describe a hired or professional killer, leading to the related term \"assassination\", which denotes any action involving murder of a high-profile target for political reasons.\n\nThe Nizari were acknowledged and feared by the Crusaders. The stories of the Assassins were further embellished by Marco Polo. European orientalist historians in the 19th century – such as Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall – also referred to the Nizari in their works and tended to write about the Nizari based on accounts by medieval Sunni Arab and Persian authors.\n\n\"Further information: Alamut\"\n\nThe origins of the Assassins can be traced back to just before the First Crusade, around 1094 in Alamut, north of modern Iran, during a crisis of succession to the Fatimid caliphate. There has been great difficulty finding out much information about the origins of the Assassins because most early sources are written by enemies of the order, are based on legends, or both. Most sources dealing with the order's inner workings were destroyed with the capture of Alamut, the Assassins' headquarters, by the Mongols in 1256. However, it is possible to trace the beginnings of the cult back to its first Grandmaster, Hassan-i Sabbah (1050s–1124).\n\nA passionate devotee of Isma'ili beliefs, Hassan-i Sabbah was well-liked throughout Cairo, Syria and most of the Middle East by other Isma'ili, which led to a number of people becoming his followers. Using his fame and popularity, Sabbah founded the Order of the Assassins. While his motives for founding this order are ultimately unknown, it was said to be all for his own political and personal gain and to also exact vengeance on his enemies. Because of the unrest in the Holy Land caused by the Crusades, Hassan-i Sabbah found himself not only fighting for power with other Muslims, but also with the invading Christian forces.\n\nAfter creating the Order, Sabbah searched for a location that would be fit for a sturdy headquarters and decided on the fortress at Alamut in what is now northwestern Iran. The Alamut castle was built by the Justanid ruler, Wahsudan b. Marzuban, a follower of zaydi Shiaism, around 865 AD. Sabbah and adapted the fortress to suit his needs not only for defense from hostile forces, but also for indoctrination of his followers. After laying claim to the fortress at Alamut, Sabbah began expanding his influence outwards to nearby towns and districts, using his agents to gain political favour and to intimidate the local populations.\n\nSpending most of his days at Alamut producing religious works and developing doctrines for his Order, Sabbah would never leave his fortress again in his lifetime. He had established a secret society of deadly assassins, which was built on a hierarchical structure. Below Sabbah, the Grand Headmaster of the Order, were those known as \"Greater Propagandists\", followed by the normal \"Propagandists\", the Rafiqs (\"Companions\"), and the Lasiqs (\"Adherents\"). It was the Lasiqs who were trained to become some of the most feared assassins, or as they were called, \"Fida'in\" (self-sacrificing agents).\n\nHowever, it is unknown how Hassan-i-Sabbah was able to get his \"Fida'in\" to perform with such fervent loyalty. One theory, possibly the best known but also the most criticized, comes from the reports of Marco Polo during his travels to the Orient. He recounts a story he heard of a man who would drug his young followers with hashish, lead them to a \"paradise\", and then claim that only he had the means to allow for their return. Perceiving that Sabbah was either a prophet or magician, his disciples, believing that only he could return them to \"paradise\", were fully committed to his cause and willing to carry out his every request. However, this story is disputed because Sabbah died in 1124 and Sinan, who is frequently known as the \"Old Man of the Mountain\", died in 1192, whereas Marco Polo was not born until around 1254.\n\nWith his new weapons, Sabbah began to order assassinations, ranging from politicians to great generals. Assassins would rarely attack ordinary citizens though, and tended not to be hostile towards them.\n\nAlthough the \"Fida'yin\" were the lowest rank in Sabbah's order and were only used as expendable pawns to do the Grandmaster's bidding, much time and many resources were put into training them. The Assassins were generally young in age, giving them the physical strength and stamina which would be required to carry out these murders. However, physical prowess was not the only trait that was required to be a \"Fida'i\". To get to their targets, the Assassins had to be patient, cold, and calculating. They were generally intelligent and well-read because they were required to possess not only knowledge about their enemy, but his or her culture and their native language. They were trained by their masters to disguise themselves and sneak into enemy territory to perform the assassinations, instead of simply attacking their target outright.\n\nThe word \"ASAS\" in Arabic means principle. The \"Asasyun\" (plural, literary Arabic, official texts, proper form) were as defined in Arabic; people of principle. Asasi (singular) and asasin pronounced \"asaseen\" (plural, literary variation as well as regular spoken Arabic, more commonly used) The term \"assassin\" can easily, however unlikely in this instance, be thought as finding its roots in \"hashshāshīn\"(hashish smokers or users). It is far more likely to be a mispronunciation of the original Asasyun. However, not a mispronunciation of \"asaseen\". One can therefore see how its origins became assassin in Western languages. Originally referring to the methods of political control exercised by the Asasyun as defined by their activities and Later, the almost identical borrowed term assassin(s) used in several languages to describe similar activities anywhere.\n\nThe Assassins were finally linked by the 19th-century orientalist scholar Silvestre de Sacy to the Arabic word \"hashish\" using their variant names \"assassin\" and \"assissini\" in the 19th century. Citing the example of one of the first written applications of the Arabic term \"hashish\" to the Ismailis by 13th-century historian Abu Shama, de Sacy demonstrated its connection to the name given to the Ismailis throughout Western scholarship. The first known usage of the term \"hashishi\" has been traced back to 1122 when the Fatimid caliph al-Āmir employed it in derogatory reference to the Syrian Nizaris. Used figuratively, the term \"hashishi\" connoted meanings such as outcasts or rabble. Without actually accusing the group of using the hashish drug, the Caliph used the term in a pejorative manner. This label was quickly adopted by anti-Ismaili historians and applied to the Ismailis of Syria and Persia. The spread of the term was further facilitated through military encounters between the Nizaris and the Crusaders, whose chroniclers adopted the term and disseminated it across Europe.\n\nDuring the medieval period, Western scholarship on the Ismailis contributed to the popular view of the community as a radical sect of assassins, believed to be trained for the precise murder of their adversaries. By the 14th century, European scholarship on the topic had not advanced much beyond the work and tales from the Crusaders. The origins of the word forgotten, across Europe the term Assassin had taken the meaning of \"professional murderer\". In 1603, the first Western publication on the topic of the Assassins was authored by a court official for King Henry IV of France and was mainly based on the narratives of Marco Polo from his visits to the Near East. While he assembled the accounts of many Western travellers, the author failed to explain the etymology of the term Assassin.\n\nAccording to the Lebanese writer Amin Maalouf, based on texts from Alamut, Hassan-i Sabbah tended to call his disciples \"Asāsīyūn\" (, meaning \"people who are faithful to the foundation [of the faith]\"), and derivation from the term \"hashish\" is a misunderstanding by foreign travelers.\n\nAnother modern author, Edward Burman, states that:\nThe name \"Assassin\" is often said to derive from the Arabic word \"Hashishin\" or \"users of hashish\",(which can be used as a derogatory term in Arabic and it is the equivalent of \"drug addict\", in this case, \"hashish addict\") was originally applied to the Nizari Ismaelis by the rival Mustali Ismailis during the fall of the Ismaili Fatimid Empire and the separation of the two Ismaili streams, there is little evidence hashish was used to motivate the assassins, contrary to the beliefs of their medieval enemies. It is possible that the term \"hashishiyya\" or \"hashishi\" in Arabic sources was used metaphorically in its abusive sense relating to use of hashish, which due to its effects on the mind state, is outlawed in Islam. Modern versions of this word include \"Mahashish\" used in the same derogatory sense, albeit less offensive nowadays, as the use of the substance is more widespread.\n\nIdries Shah, a sufi scholar using \"Arkon Daraul\" as a pen name, described them as 'druggers' that used hashish \"in stupefying candidates for the ephemeral visit to \"paradise\"\".\n\nThe Sunni Muslims also used the term \"mulhid\" to refer to the Assassins, which is also recorded by the traveller William of Rubruck as \"\".\n\nIn pursuit of their religious and political goals, the Ismailis adopted various military strategies popular in the Middle Ages. One such method was that of assassination, the selective elimination of prominent rival figures. The murders of political adversaries were usually carried out in public spaces, creating resounding intimidation for other possible enemies. Throughout history, many groups have resorted to assassination as a means of achieving political ends. In the Ismaili context, these assignments were performed by \"fida'is\" (devotees) of the Ismaili mission. The assassinations were committed against those whose elimination would most greatly reduce aggression against the Ismailis and, in particular, against those who had perpetrated massacres against the community. A single assassination was usually employed in contrast with the widespread bloodshed which generally resulted from factional combat. Hashashin are also said to be adept in \"furusiyya\", or the Islamic warrior code, where they are trained in combat, disguises, and equestrianism. Codes of conduct are followed, and the hashashin are taught in the art of war, linguistics, and strategies. Hashashin never allowed their women to be at their fortresses during military campaigns, both for protection and secrecy. This is a tradition first made by Hassan when he sent his wife and daughters to Girdkuh when a famine was created during the Seljuk siege of Alamut. For about two centuries, the hashashin specialized in assassinating their religious and political enemies.\n\nThe first instance of murder in the effort to establish a Nizari Ismaili state in Persia is widely considered to be the killing of Seljuq vizier, Nizam al-Mulk. Carried out by a man dressed as a Sufi whose identity remains unclear, the vizier's murder in a Seljuq court is distinctive of exactly the type of visibility for which missions of the \"fida'is\" have been significantly exaggerated. While the Seljuqs and Crusaders both employed murder as a military means of disposing of factional enemies, during the Alamut period almost any murder of political significance in the Islamic lands was attributed to the Ismailis. So inflated had this association grown that, in the work of orientalist scholars such as Bernard Lewis, the Ismailis were equated with the politically active \"fida'is\" and thus were regarded as a radical and heretical sect known as the Assassins.\n\nThe military approach of the Nizari Ismaili state was largely a defensive one, with strategically chosen sites that appeared to avoid confrontation wherever possible without the loss of life. But the defining characteristic of the Nizari Ismaili state was that it was scattered geographically throughout Persia and Syria. The Alamut castle therefore was only one of a nexus of strongholds throughout the regions where Ismailis could retreat to safety if necessary. West of Alamut in the Shahrud Valley, the major fortress of Lamasar served as just one example of such a retreat. In the context of their political uprising, the various spaces of Ismaili military presence took on the name \"dar al-hijra\" (; land of migration, place of refuge). The notion of the \"dar al-hijra\" originates from the time of Muhammad, who migrated with his followers from persecution to a safe haven in \"Yathrib\" (Medina). In this way, the Fatimids found their \"dar al-hijra\" in North Africa. From 1101 to 1118, attacks and sieges were made on the fortresses, conducted by combined forces of Seljuk, Berkyaruq, and Sanjar. Although with the cost of lives and the capture and execution of assassin dai Ahmad ibn Hattash, the hashashin managed to hold their ground and repel the attacks until the Mongol invasion. Likewise, during the revolt against the Seljuqs, several fortresses served as spaces of refuge for the Ismailis.\n\nAt their peak, many of the assassinations of the day were often attributed to the hashashin. Even though the Crusaders and the other factions employed personal assassins, the fact that the hashashin performed their assassinations in full view of the public, often in broad daylight, gave them the reputation assigned to them.\n\nPsychological warfare, and attacking the enemy's psyche was another often employed tactic of the hashashin, who would sometimes attempt to draw their opponents into submission rather than risk killing them.\n\nDuring the Seljuk invasion after the death of Muhammad Tapar, a new Seljuk sultan emerged with the coronation of Tapar's son Sanjar. When Sanjar rebuffed the hashashin ambassadors who were sent by Hassan for peace negotiations, Hassan sent his hashashin to the sultan. Sanjar woke up one morning with a dagger stuck in the ground beside his bed. Alarmed, he kept the matter a secret. A messenger from Hassan arrived and stated, \"Did I not wish the sultan well that the dagger which was struck in the hard ground would have been planted on your soft breast\". For the next several decades there ensued a ceasefire between the Nizaris and the Seljuk. Sanjar himself pensioned the hashashin on taxes collected from the lands they owned, gave them grants and licenses, and even allowed them to collect tolls from travelers.\n\nThe Assassins were eradicated by the Mongol Empire during the well-documented invasion of Khwarizm. They probably dispatched their assassins to kill Möngke Khan. Thus, a decree was handed over to the Mongol commander Kitbuqa who began to assault several Hashashin fortresses in 1253 before Hulagu's advance in 1256. The Mongols besieged Alamut on December 15, 1256. The Assassins recaptured and held Alamut for a few months in 1275, but they were crushed and their political power was lost forever.\n\nThe Syrian branch of the Assassins was taken over by the Mamluk Sultan Baibars in 1273. The Mamluks continued to use the services of the remaining Assassins: in the 14th century Ibn Battuta reported their fixed rate of pay per murder. In exchange, they were allowed to exist. Eventually, they resorted to the act of Taqq'iya (dissimulation), hiding their true identities until their Imams would awaken them.\n\nAccording to the historian Yaqut al-Hamawi, the Böszörmény, (Izmaleita or Ismaili/Nizari) denomination of Muslims who lived in the Kingdom of Hungary from the 10th to the 13th centuries, were employed as mercenaries by the kings of Hungary. However, following the establishment of the Christian Kingdom of Hungary, their community was vanquished by the end of the 13th century due to the Inquisitions ordered by the Catholic Church during the reign of Coloman, King of Hungary. It is said that the Assassins are the ancestors of those given the surname Hajaly, derived from the word \"hajal\", a rare species of bird found in the mountains of Syria near Masyaf. The hajal (bird) was often used as a symbol of the Assassin's order.\n\nThe legends of the Assassins had much to do with the training and instruction of Nizari \"fida'is\", famed for their public missions during which they often gave their lives to eliminate adversaries. Historians have contributed to the tales of \"fida'is\" being fed with hashish as part of their training. Whether \"fida'is\" were actually trained or dispatched by Nizari leaders is unconfirmed, but scholars including Vladimir Ivanov purport that the assassinations of key figures including Saljuq vizier Nizam al-Mulk likely provided encouraging impetus to others in the community who sought to secure the Nizaris protection from political aggression. Originally, a \"local and popular term\" first applied to the Ismailis of Syria, the label was orally transmitted to Western historians and thus found itself in their histories of the Nizaris.\n\nThe tales of the \"fida'is\" training collected from anti-Ismaili historians and orientalist writers were compounded and compiled in Marco Polo's account, in which he described a \"secret garden of paradise\". After being drugged, the Ismaili devotees were said to be taken to a paradise-like garden filled with attractive young maidens and beautiful plants in which these \"fida'is\" would awaken. Here, they were told by an \"old\" man that they were witnessing their place in Paradise and that should they wish to return to this garden permanently, they must serve the Nizari cause. So went the tale of the \"Old Man in the Mountain\", assembled by Marco Polo and accepted by Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, an 18th-century Austrian orientalist writer responsible for much of the spread of this legend. Until the 1930s, von Hammer's retelling of the Assassin legends served as the standard account of the Nizaris across Europe.\n\nAnother one of Hassan's recorded methods includes causing the hashashin to be vilified by their contemporaries. One story goes that Hassan al-Sabah set up a trick to make it appear as if he had decapitated one of his hashashin and the \"dead\" hashashin's head lay at the foot of his throne. It was actually one of his men buried up to his neck covered with blood. He invited his hashashin to speak to it. He said that he used special powers to allow it to communicate. The supposed talking head would tell the hashashin about paradise after death if they gave all their hearts to the cause. After the trick was played, Hassan had the man killed and his head placed on a stake in order to cement the deception.\n\nA well-known legend tells how Count Henry of Champagne, returning from Armenia, spoke with Grand Master Rashid ad-Din Sinan at al-Kahf. The count claimed to have the most powerful army and at any moment he claimed he could defeat the Hashshashin, because his army was 10 times larger. Rashid replied that his army was instead the most powerful, and to prove it he told one of his men to jump off from the top of the castle in which they were staying. The man did. Surprised, the count immediately recognized that Rashid's army was indeed the strongest, because it did everything at his command, and Rashid further gained the count's respect.\n\nModern works on the Nizaris have elucidated their history and, in doing so, dispelled popular histories from the past as mere legends. In 1933, under the direction of the Imam Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III, the Islamic Research Association was developed. Historian Vladimir Ivanov was central to both this institution and the 1946 Ismaili Society of Bombay. Cataloguing a number of Ismaili texts, Ivanov provided the ground for great strides in modern Ismaili scholarship.\n\nIn recent years, Peter Willey has provided interesting evidence that goes against the Assassin folklore of earlier scholars. Drawing on its established esoteric doctrine, Willey asserts that the Ismaili understanding of Paradise is a deeply symbolic one. While the Qur'anic description of Heaven includes natural imagery, Willey argues that no Nizari \"fida'i\" would seriously believe that he was witnessing Paradise simply by awakening in a beauteous garden. The Nizaris' symbolic interpretation of the Qur'anic description of Paradise serves as evidence against the possibility of such an exotic garden used as motivation for the devotees to carry out their armed missions. Furthermore, Willey points out that a courtier of Hulagu Khan, Juvayni, surveyed the Alamut castle just before the Mongol invasion. In his reports about the fortress, there are elaborate descriptions of sophisticated storage facilities and the famous Alamut library. However, even this anti-Ismaili historian makes no mention of the gardens on the Alamut grounds. Having destroyed a number of texts in the library's collection, deemed by Juvayni to be heretical, it would be expected that he would pay significant attention to the Nizari gardens, particularly if they were the site of drug use and temptation. Having not once mentioned such gardens, Willey concludes that there is no sound evidence in favour of these legends.\n\nThese legends feature in certain works of fiction, including Vladimir Bartol's 1938 novel \"Alamut\", and Simon Acland's First Crusade novels \"The Waste Land\" and \"The Flowers of Evil\". In the latter, the author suggests that the origin of the name Assassin is the Turkish word \"hashhash\" meaning opium, partly on the basis that this drug is more suitable for producing the effects suggested in the legends than hashish.\n\nDuring the mid-12th century the Assassins captured or acquired several fortresses in the Nusayriyah Mountain Range in coastal Syria, including Masyaf, Rusafa, al-Kahf, al-Qadmus, Khawabi, Sarmin, Quliya, Ulayqa, Maniqa, Abu Qubays and Jabal al-Summaq. For the most part, the Assassins maintained full control over these fortresses until 1270–73 when the Mamluk sultan Baibars annexed them. Most were dismantled afterwards, while those at Masyaf and Ulayqa were later rebuilt. From then on, the Ismailis maintained limited autonomy over those former strongholds as loyal subjects of the Mamluks.\n\nThe Hashashin were part of Medieval culture, and they were either demonized or romanticized. The Hashashin appeared frequently in the art and literature of the Middle Ages, sometimes illustrated as one of the knight's archenemies and as a quintessential villain during the crusades.\n\nThe word Assassin, in variant forms, had already passed into European usage in this general sense as a term for a hired professional murderer. The Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani, who died in 1348, tells how the lord of Lucca sent 'his assassins' (i suoi assassini) to Pisa to kill a troublesome enemy there. Even earlier, Dante, in a passing reference in the 19th canto of the \"Inferno\", speaks of 'the treacherous assassin' (lo perfido assassin); his fourteenth-century commentator Francesco da Buti, explaining a term which for some readers at the time may still have been strange and obscure, remarks: 'Assassino è colui che uccide altrui per danari' (An assassin is one who kills others for money).\n\nThe Assassins appear in many role-playing games and video games, especially in massively multiplayer online games. The assassin character class is a common feature of many such games, usually specializing in single combat and stealth skills, often combined in order to defeat an opponent without exposing the assassin to counter-attack.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They describe switchings between a finite set of tasks in a modular fashion. Their strength comes from their ability to create very complex tasks composed of simple tasks, without worrying how the simple tasks are implemented. BTs present some similarities to hierarchical state machines with the key difference that the main building block of a behavior is a task rather than a state. Its ease of human understanding make BTs less error prone and very popular in the game developer community. BTs have been shown to generalize several other control architectures. \n\nBTs originate from the computer game industry as a powerful tool to model the behavior of non-player characters (NPCs).\nThey have been extensively used in high-profile video games such as Halo, Bioshock, and Spore. Recent works propose BTs as a multi-mission control framework for UAV, complex robots, robotic manipulation, and multi-robot systems.\nBT have now reached the maturity to be treated in Game AI textbooks \nas well as generic game environments such as PyGame and Unreal Engine (see links below).\n\nIt has been shown that BTs generalize a number of earlier control architectures, such as\n\nBT is graphically represented as a directed tree in which the nodes are classified as root, control flow nodes, or execution nodes (tasks). For each pair of connected nodes the outgoing node is called parent and the incoming node is called child. The root has no parents and exactly one child, the control flow nodes have one parent and at least one child, and the execution nodes have one parent and no children. Graphically, the children of a control flow node are placed below it, ordered from left to right.\n\nThe execution of a BT starts from the root which sends ticks with a certain frequency to its child. A tick is an enabling signal that allows the execution of a child. When the execution of a node in the BT is allowed, it returns to the parent a status running if its execution has not finished yet, success if it has achieved its goal, or failure otherwise.\n\nA control flow node is used to control the subtasks of which it is composed. A control flow node may be either a selector (fallback) node or a sequence node. They run each of their subtasks in turn. When a subtask is completed and returns its status (success or failure), the control flow node decides whether to execute the next subtask or not.\n\nFallback nodes are used to find and execute the first child that does not fail. A fallback node will return immediately with a status code of success or running when one of its children returns success or running (see Figure I and the pseudocode below). The children are ticked in order of importance, from left to right.\n\nIn pseudocode, the algorithm for a fallback composition is:\n\nSequence nodes are used to find and execute the first child that has not yet succeeded. A sequence node will return immediately with a status code of failure or running when one of its children returns failure or running (see Figure II and the pseudocode below).

{"id": "319888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=319888", "title": "Blame", "text": "Blame\n\nBlame is the act of censuring, holding responsible, making negative statements about an individual or group that their action or actions are socially or morally irresponsible, the opposite of praise. When someone is morally responsible for doing something wrong their action is blameworthy. By contrast, when someone is morally responsible for doing something right, we may say that his or her action is praiseworthy. There are other senses of praise and blame that are not ethically relevant. One may praise someone's good dress sense, and blame their own sense of style for their own dress sense.\n\nBlaming appears to relate to include brain activity in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The amygdala has been found to contribute when we blame others, but not when we respond to their positive actions.\n\nHumans - consciously and unconsciously - constantly make judgments about other people. The psychological criteria for judging others may be partly ingrained, negative and rigid indicating some degree of grandiosity.\n\nBlaming provides a way of devaluing others, with the end result that the blamer feels superior, seeing others as less worthwhile making the blamer \"perfect\". Off-loading blame means putting the other person down by emphasizing his or her flaws.\n\nVictims of manipulation and abuse frequently feel responsible for causing negative feelings in the manipulator/abuser towards them and the resultant anxiety in themselves. This self-blame often becomes a major feature of victim status.\n\nThe victim gets trapped into a self-image of victimization. The psychological profile of victimization includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, pessimism, negative thinking, strong feelings of guilt, shame, remorse, self-blame and depression. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.\n\nTwo main types of self-blame exist:\n\n\nBehavioral self-blame is associated with feelings of guilt within the victim. While the belief that one had control during the abuse (past control) is associated with greater psychological distress, the belief that one has more control during the recovery process (present control) is associated with less distress, less withdrawal, and more cognitive reprocessing.\n\nCounseling responses found helpful in reducing self-blame include:\n\n\nA helpful type of therapy for self-blame is cognitive restructuring or cognitive–behavioral therapy. Cognitive reprocessing is the process of taking the facts and forming a logical conclusion from them that is less influenced by shame or guilt.\n\nVictim blaming is holding the victims of a crime, an accident, or any type of abusive maltreatment to be entirely or partially responsible for the incident that has occurred.\n\nIn sociology individual blame is the tendency of a group or society to hold the individual responsible for his or her situation, whereas system blame is the tendency to focus on social factors that contribute to one's fate. \n\nBlaming others can lead to a \"kick the dog\" effect where individuals in a hierarchy blame their immediate subordinate, and this propagates down a hierarchy until the lowest rung (the \"dog\"). A 2009 experimental study has shown that blaming can be contagious even for uninvolved onlookers.\n\nLabeling theory accounts for blame by postulating that when intentional actors act out to continuously blame an individual for nonexistent psychological traits and for nonexistent variables, those actors aim to induce irrational guilt at an unconscious level. Blame in this case becomes a propaganda tactic, using repetitive blaming behaviors, innuendos, and hyperbole in order to assign negative status to normative humans. When innocent people are blamed fraudulently for nonexistent psychological states and nonexistent behaviors, and there is no qualifying deviance for the blaming behaviors, the intention is to create a negative valuation of innocent humans to induce fear, by using fear mongering. For centuries, governments have used blaming in the form of demonization to influence public perceptions of various other governments, to induce feelings of nationalism in the public. Blame can objectify people, groups, and nations, typically negatively influencing the intended subjects of propaganda, compromising their objectivity. Blame is utilized as a social-control technique.\n\nSome systems theorists and management consultants, such as Gerald Weinberg, see the flow of blame in an organization as one of the most important indicators of that organization's robustness and integrity. Blame flowing upwards in a hierarchy, Weinberg argues, proves that superiors can take responsibility for their orders to their inferiors, and supply them with the resources required to do their jobs. But blame flowing downwards, from management to staff, or laterally between professionals, indicate organizational failure. In a blame culture, problem-solving is replaced by blame-avoidance. Weinberg emphasizes that blame coming from the top generates \"fear, malaise, errors, accidents, and passive-aggressive responses from the bottom\", with those at the bottom feeling powerless and lacking emotional safety.\n\nA \"no-blame culture\" has been widely considered as a means to increase safety, in particular in areas where the consideration of possible human error is important, for instance in hospitals and in aviation. Together with questions of accountability, this has also been subsumed under the concept of creating a \"Just culture\". However, research conducted by King's College London found that increasing transparency and regulation in health care had unintended consequences of increasing defensive practice. Linked to rare but high-profile scandals, a self-interested blame business was found to be increasing a presumption of \"guilty until proven innocent\"\n\n\n"}

The film is about an alleged 1990 murder in the village of Munnsville, New York. The film is in the \"Direct Cinema\" style of the Maysles brothers, who had formerly employed Berlinger and Sinofsky. \n\nThe film contrasts two groups of society; people from rural areas and those from larger cities. It also exhibits how the media flocked to the town to cover the story.\n\nThis movie displays two completely opposite views of the Ward brothers. One opinion is that of the locals, who defend the Ward brothers as simple country folk. The other is that of the press, who stereotype the brothers as uneducated hicks.\n\nThe Ward sister was not featured in this film because of her death in the 1980s. However, her daughter Pat makes an appearance in the DVD's special features.\n\nIn a rural farming community near Syracuse, New York, four brothers lived in a dilapidated house. The brothers were Roscoe (July 23, 1919 - June 23, 2007), Lyman George (July 7, 1923 - August 15, 2007), William Jay (July 10, 1926 - June 6, 1990), and Adelbert Daniel (known as Delbert) (October 5, 1931 - August 6, 1998). The men were barely literate, had no formal education, and farmed land that had been in their family for generations.\n\nWilliam Ward, who had been ill for years, was found dead one morning. Delbert was accused of killing him, perhaps by smothering. The prosecution's theory at trial was that Delbert had performed a mercy killing in order to put William out of his misery after a period of severe headaches and declining health. As the film progresses, it is revealed that during the coroner's examination of William's body, semen was found on clothing and on William's leg, leading to the suggestion that Delbert had killed William in an episode of \"sex gone bad.\" The film never follows up on this media sensation.\n\nDelbert Ward was acquitted at trial, largely because the lack of any physical evidence and that the New York State Police violated Delbert's rights by coercing a confession (which he later retracted) and by having him sign a written statement which he could not understand due to illiteracy.\n\nDelbert Ward died at age 68 at Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, New York on August 6, 1998.\n\nRoscoe Ward died at age 88 on June 23, 2007.\n\nLyman Ward died at age 85 in Utica, New York on August 15, 2007.\n\nThe title \"Brother's Keeper\" comes from the Book of Genesis in the Bible.

{"id": "271430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=271430", "title": "Computational neuroscience", "text": "Computational neuroscience\n\nComputational neuroscience (also known as theoretical neuroscience or mathematical neuroscience) is a branch of neuroscience which employs mathematical models, theoretical analysis and abstractions of the brain to understand the principles that govern the development, structure, physiology and cognitive abilities of the nervous system.\n\nComputational neuroscience focuses on the description of biologically plausible neurons (and neural systems) and their physiology and dynamics, and it is therefore not concerned with biologically unrealistic disciplines such as connectionism, machine learning, artificial neural networks, artificial intelligence and computational learning theory.\n\nIn theory, computational neuroscience would be a sub-field of theoretical neuroscience which employs computational simulations to validate and solve the mathematical models. However, since the biologically plausible mathematical models formulated in neuroscience are in most cases too complex to be solved analytically, the two terms are essentially synonyms and are used interchangeably. The term mathematical neuroscience is also used sometimes, to stress the quantitative nature of the field.\n\nThe mathematical models formulated in computational neuroscience are useful since they capture the essential features of the biological system at multiple spatial-temporal scales, from membrane currents, proteins, and chemical coupling to network oscillations, columnar and topographic architecture, and learning and memory. Furthermore, these computational models frame hypotheses that can be directly tested by biological or psychological experiments.\n\nThe term 'computational neuroscience' was introduced by Eric L. Schwartz, who organized a conference, held in 1985 in Carmel, California, at the request of the Systems Development Foundation to provide a summary of the current status of a field which until that point was referred to by a variety of names, such as neural modeling, brain theory and neural networks. The proceedings of this definitional meeting were published in 1990 as the book \"Computational Neuroscience\". The first open international meeting focused on Computational Neuroscience was organized by James M. Bower and John Miller in San Francisco, California in 1989 and has continued each year since as the annual CNS meeting. The first graduate educational program in computational neuroscience was organized as the Computational and Neural Systems Ph.D. program at the California Institute of Technology in 1985.\n\nThe early historical roots of the field can be traced to the work of people such as Louis Lapicque, Hodgkin & Huxley, Hubel & Wiesel, and David Marr, to name a few. Lapicque introduced the integrate and fire model of the neuron in a seminal article published in 1907. This model is still popular today for artificial neural networks studies because of its simplicity (see a recent review).\n\nAbout 40 years later, Hodgkin & Huxley developed the voltage clamp and created the first biophysical model of the action potential. Hubel & Wiesel discovered that neurons in the primary visual cortex, the first cortical area to process information coming from the retina, have oriented receptive fields and are organized in columns. David Marr's work focused on the interactions between neurons, suggesting computational approaches to the study of how functional groups of neurons within the hippocampus and neocortex interact, store, process, and transmit information. Computational modeling of biophysically realistic neurons and dendrites began with the work of Wilfrid Rall, with the first multicompartmental model using cable theory.\n\nResearch in computational neuroscience can be roughly categorized into several lines of inquiry. Most computational neuroscientists collaborate closely with experimentalists in analyzing novel data and synthesizing new models of biological phenomena.\n\nEven single neurons have complex biophysical characteristics and can perform computations (e.g.). Hodgkin and Huxley's original model only employed two voltage-sensitive currents (Voltage sensitive ion channels are glycoprotein molecules which extend through the lipid bilayer, allowing ions to traverse under certain conditions through the axolemma), the fast-acting sodium and the inward-rectifying potassium. Though successful in predicting the timing and qualitative features of the action potential, it nevertheless failed to predict a number of important features such as adaptation and shunting. Scientists now believe that there are a wide variety of voltage-sensitive currents, and the implications of the differing dynamics, modulations, and sensitivity of these currents is an important topic of computational neuroscience.\n\nThe computational functions of complex dendrites are also under intense investigation. There is a large body of literature regarding how different currents interact with geometric properties of neurons.\n\nSome models are also tracking biochemical pathways at very small scales such as spines or synaptic clefts.\n\nThere are many software packages, such as GENESIS and NEURON, that allow rapid and systematic \"in silico\" modeling of realistic neurons. Blue Brain, a project founded by Henry Markram from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, aims to construct a biophysically detailed simulation of a cortical column on the Blue Gene supercomputer.\n\nModeling the richness of biophysical properties on the single-neuron scale can supply mechanisms that serve as the building blocks for network dynamics. However, detailed neuron descriptions are computationally expensive and this can handicap the pursuit of realistic network investigations, where many neurons need to be simulated. As a result, researchers that study large neural circuits typically represent each neuron and synapse with an artificially simple model, ignoring much of the biological detail. Hence there is a drive to produce simplified neuron models that can retain significant biological fidelity at a low computational overhead. Algorithms have been developed to produce faithful, faster running, simplified surrogate neuron models from computationally expensive, detailed neuron models.\n\nComputational neuroscience aims to address a wide array of questions. How do axons and dendrites form during development? How do axons know where to target and how to reach these targets? How do neurons migrate to the proper position in the central and peripheral systems? How do synapses form? We know from molecular biology that distinct parts of the nervous system release distinct chemical cues, from growth factors to hormones that modulate and influence the growth and development of functional connections between neurons.\n\nTheoretical investigations into the formation and patterning of synaptic connection and morphology are still nascent. One hypothesis that has recently garnered some attention is the \"minimal wiring hypothesis\", which postulates that the formation of axons and dendrites effectively minimizes resource allocation while maintaining maximal information storage.\n\nEarly models of sensory processing understood within a theoretical framework are credited to Horace Barlow. Somewhat similar to the minimal wiring hypothesis described in the preceding section, Barlow understood the processing of the early sensory systems to be a form of efficient coding, where the neurons encoded information which minimized the number of spikes. Experimental and computational work have since supported this hypothesis in one form or another.\n\nCurrent research in sensory processing is divided among a biophysical modelling of different subsystems and a more theoretical modelling of perception. Current models of perception have suggested that the brain performs some form of Bayesian inference and integration of different sensory information in generating our perception of the physical world.\n\nEarlier models of memory are primarily based on the postulates of Hebbian learning. Biologically relevant models such as Hopfield net have been developed to address the properties of associative (also known as \"content-addressable\") style of memory that occur in biological systems. These attempts are primarily focusing on the formation of medium- and long-term memory, localizing in the hippocampus. Models of working memory, relying on theories of network oscillations and persistent activity, have been built to capture some features of the prefrontal cortex in context-related memory.\n\nOne of the major problems in neurophysiological memory is how it is maintained and changed through multiple time scales. Unstable synapses are easy to train but also prone to stochastic disruption. Stable synapses forget less easily, but they are also harder to consolidate. One recent computational hypothesis involves cascades of plasticity that allow synapses to function at multiple time scales. Stereochemically detailed models of the acetylcholine receptor-based synapse with the Monte Carlo method, working at the time scale of microseconds, have been built. It is likely that computational tools will contribute greatly to our understanding of how synapses function and change in relation to external stimulus in the coming decades.\n\nBiological neurons are connected to each other in a complex, recurrent fashion. These connections are, unlike most artificial neural networks, sparse and usually specific. It is not known how information is transmitted through such sparsely connected networks, although specific areas of the brain, such as the Visual cortex, are understood in some detail. It is also unknown what the computational functions of these specific connectivity patterns are, if any.\n\nThe interactions of neurons in a small network can be often reduced to simple models such as the Ising model. The statistical mechanics of such simple systems are well-characterized theoretically. There has been some recent evidence that suggests that dynamics of arbitrary neuronal networks can be reduced to pairwise interactions. It is not known, however, whether such descriptive dynamics impart any important computational function. With the emergence of two-photon microscopy and calcium imaging, we now have powerful experimental methods with which to test the new theories regarding neuronal networks.\n\nIn some cases the complex interactions between \"inhibitory\" and \"excitatory\" neurons can be simplified using mean field theory, which gives rise to the population model of neural networks. While many neurotheorists prefer such models with reduced complexity, others argue that uncovering structural functional relations depends on including as much neuronal and network structure as possible. Models of this type are typically built in large simulation platforms like GENESIS or NEURON. There have been some attempts to provide unified methods that bridge and integrate these levels of complexity.\n\nComputational modeling of higher cognitive functions has only recently begun. Experimental data comes primarily from single-unit recording in primates. The frontal lobe and parietal lobe function as integrators of information from multiple sensory modalities. There are some tentative ideas regarding how simple mutually inhibitory functional circuits in these areas may carry out biologically relevant computation.\n\nThe brain seems to be able to discriminate and adapt particularly well in certain contexts. For instance, human beings seem to have an enormous capacity for memorizing and recognizing faces. One of the key goals of computational neuroscience is to dissect how biological systems carry out these complex computations efficiently and potentially replicate these processes in building intelligent machines.\n\nThe brain's large-scale organizational principles are illuminated by many fields, including biology, psychology, and clinical practice.

{"id": "582279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=582279", "title": "Covenant (Halo)", "text": "Covenant (Halo)\n\nThe Covenant are a fictional theocratic military alliance of alien races who serve as the main antagonists in the first trilogy of the \"Halo\" video game series. They are composed of a variety of diverse species, united under the religious worship of the Forerunners and their belief that Forerunner ringworlds known as Halos will provide a path to salvation. After the Covenant leadership—the High Prophets—declare humanity an affront to their gods, claiming the extermination of [humanity] is the 'will of their gods and [the Covenant] are [the gods'] instrument', the more advanced extraterrestrials subsequently prosecute a lengthy genocidal campaign against the technologically inferior human species.\n\nThe Covenant were first introduced in the 2001 video game \"\" as enemies of the playable character, a human super soldier known as the Master Chief. Not realizing the Halos were meant as weapons of destruction rather than salvation, the Covenant attempt to activate the rings on two separate occasions throughout the series, inadvertently releasing a virulent parasite known as the Flood in the process.\n\nTo develop a distinctive look for the various species of the Covenant, Bungie artists drew inspiration from reptilian, ursine, and avian characteristics. A Covenant design scheme of purples and reflective surfaces was made to separate the alien from human architecture. The Covenant were generally well received by critics who appreciated the challenge they provided to players; several critics lamented the change of the main enemies from Elites to Brutes in \"Halo 3\" and conversely praised their return in the later \"Halo: Reach\".\n\nLike most of the other characters and species in the \"Halo\" universe, the Covenant were slowly developed during the initial concept phase and refined as \"Halo: Combat Evolved\" progressed. During the course of development of \"Halo\", the designers decided upon three \"schools\" of architecture, for each of the races represented — the humans, the Covenant, and the Forerunners. For the Covenant, the team decided on \"sleek and shiny\", with reflective surfaces, organic shapes, and use of purples.\n\nLike the character designs, Covenant technology, architecture, and design continually changed throughout development, occasionally for practical reasons as well as aesthetics. According to Eric Arroyo, the Covenant cruiser \"Truth and Reconciliation\", which plays a major role in \"Halo: Combat Evolved\", was to be boarded by the player by a long ramp. However, due to technical considerations of having a fully textured ship so close to the player, the designers came up with a \"gravity lift\", which allowed the ship to be farther away (thus not requiring as much processing power for detail) as well as adding a \"visually interesting\" component of Covenant technology.\n\nThe art team also spent a large amount of time on Covenant weaponry, in order to make them suitably alien yet still recognizable to players. At the same time, the designers wanted all aspects of Covenant technology, especially the vehicles, to act plausibly. Bungie ended up looking at films and other media for inspiration on almost every aspect of the race.\nTo design the various species of the Covenant, Bungie's artists looked at live animals and films for inspiration; as a result, the species within the Covenant bear simian, reptilian, avian, and ursine characteristics.\n\nOne of the strongest and toughest foes (and allies) of the games, Elites (who are from Sanghelios) are called Sangheili in the fictitious Covenant language. They stand around and feature recharging personal shields. The Elites initially had simple mouths, which developed into pairs of split mandibles substituting for the lower jaws. Bungie concept artist Shi Kai Wang noted that project lead Jason Jones had, at one point, been insistent on giving the Elites a tail. While Wang thought it made the aliens look too animalistic, the idea was eventually dropped due to practical considerations, including where the tail would go when the Elites were driving vehicles. \"At one point, we considered just having the Elites tuck their tails forward, between their legs,\" Wang noted, \"But [we] abandoned that... for obvious reasons.\" According to Paul Russel, when Bungie was bought by Microsoft and \"Halo\" was turned into an Xbox launch title, Microsoft took issue with the design of the Elites, as they felt that the Elites had a resemblance to cats that might alienate Japanese consumers.\n\nAmong the other races developed were Grunts, or Unggoy (from the planet Balaho), viewed in game's fiction as cannon fodder. Depicted as squat and cowardly fighters, Grunts generally break formation, panicking and fleeing in terror if a player or an NPC kills their commanding officer. However, they are also notable for attempting suicide runs against enemies on higher difficulties, charging at their foe with a plasma grenade in each hand in an attempt to kill the opponent and/ or themselves.\n\nUnggoy are intelligent, having been industrialized before their induction into the Covenant. The novels \"Halo: Fall of Reach\" and \"Halo: The Flood\", described the Unggoy as dog-like methane-breathers. They are stocky, possessing both an arthropod-like exoskeleton, and a spinal-based nervous system. Their powerful forearms evolved for climbing vertical terrain. Unggoy have methane suits that allow them to remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Unggoy in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.\n\nJackals, or Kig-Yar, (from the moon of Eayn, orbiting Chu'ot) carry energy shields or ranged weaponry. Shield or armor colors denotes the rank of each caste. In some cases, such as with the Jackals, the overall design was honed once the enemy's role was clearly defined. They look like bird-like creatures or raptors. This particular species did not come into the Covenant in the same way as other species. They work as mercenaries, as their culture is based on piracy and do not follow the religious beliefs like the other species. In the \"Halo\" book, \"Halo: Contact Harvest\", it was revealed that Jackals were the first species in the Covenant to encounter humanity. The resulting events initiated the start of the Human-Covenant War.\n\nHunters, or Mgalekgolo, (from the planet Te) are, according to Bungie's mythology, collectives of worm-like aliens, singularly known as Lekgolo, encased in tough armor. Initial concepts were less humanoid-looking and softer than the final shape, with angular shields and razor-sharp spines. The species are armed with a heavy plasma repeater cannon and also carry a massive shield.\n\nFloating, serene aliens known as Engineers, or Huragok, were pulled from \"Combat Evolved\", but made later appearances in the \"Halo\" novels. They also appeared in \"Halo Wars\", \"Halo 3: ODST\", and \"Halo: Reach\". They serve no actual combat role, although in \"Halo 3: ODST,\" \"Halo Wars\" and \"Halo Reach\" they can aid players or enemies. They are actually artificial lifeforms created by the vanished technologically superior race known as the Forerunners, and are enslaved by the Covenant to build, repair and maintain their technology.\n\nThe Prophets, or San'Shyuum, (from the planet Janjur Qom) serve as the royal rulers of the Covenant, and were primarily designed by Shi Kai Wang and Eric Arroyo. Originally, the Prophets were built in a more unified way, with the gravity thrones they used for flotation and movement fused with the Prophet's organic structures. The characters were also designed to be feeble, yet sinister. The three Prophet Hierarchs were each individually designed.\n\nBrutes (from the planet Doisac) are one of the new fighting forces that were added in \"Halo 2\". They were made physically taller and stronger than the Elites, with their society organized around tribal chieftains. Inspired by the animators watching biker films, the Brutes incorporated simian and ursine elements while retaining an alien look. Wang's final concept for the creature, replete with bandoliers and human skulls, was simplified for the game. Brutes were meant to typify the abusive alien menace of the Covenant and in the words of design lead Jaime Griesemer, to serve as \"barbarians in Rome\".\n\nFor the final installment in the \"Halo\" trilogy, \"Halo 3\", designers had to refine the Covenant for the move to more powerful Xbox 360 hardware. Bungie was dissatisfied with the Brutes in \"Halo 2\"; they were added in late in development, resulting in the Brutes functioning merely as \"damage sponges\" and \"not interesting to fight.\" Their design was also limited, being little more than hairy apes with a bandoleer (reminiscent of the \"Star Wars\" character Chewbacca). With the Elites leaving the Covenant in the game's story, the Brutes became the player's main enemy, necessitating radical changes in the character's behavior and design. For the new look of the Brutes, concept artists took inspiration from rhinoceros and gorillas. The designers added armor with buckles, gauntlets, and leather straps to bring them more in line with the Covenant aesthetic. The more seasoned the Brute, the more ornate clothing and helmets; the armor was designed to convey a culture and tradition to the species, and emphasize their mass and power. Designs for \"Halo 3\" took cues from ancient Greek Spartans. Character animators recorded intended actions for the new Brutes in a padded room at Bungie. A new addition to the Brute artificial intelligence was a pack mentality; leader Brutes direct large-scale actions simultaneously, such as throwing grenades towards a player.\n\nAnother addition to the fighting force debuting in \"Halo 2\" were Drones, or Yanme'e (from the planet Palamok); the animators found the creatures challenging, as they had to be animated to walk, run, crawl, or fly on multiple surfaces. Old concept art from \"Combat Evolved\" was re-purposed in influencing the Drone's final shape, which took cues from cockroaches, grasshoppers, and wasps.\n\nTechnologically, the Covenant are described in \"\" and \"\" to be imitative rather than innovative—most of the Covenant's sophisticated weaponry and propulsion systems are based on Forerunner artifacts, rather than the Covenant's own research. Covenant weapons are generally based on Forerunner technology and utilize plasma. These weapons are built around a battery that generates plasma and discharges it at a target. Frank O'Connor, Bungie's former public relations head, hinted that there may be something more to the Covenant's weaponry, saying \"the actual technology is not plasma as we know it, but something far more dangerous, arcane, and destructive.\" A few of the Covenant's weapons are not plasma-based, including the Needler, which fires razor-sharp pink needles capable of \"homing in\" on organic foes and exploding. A weapons expert noted parallels between the Needler and ancient Greek Amazons painting their daggers pink as a psychological weapon in an issue of gaming magazine \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\".\n\nBungie designed the majority of Covenant technology to mirror the aesthetic of the Elites; the exteriors are sleek and graceful, with a more angular and complex core underneath hinting at the fictional Forerunner origins of the technology. In contrast to the sleek Elite-based designs of the Covenant at large, the Brutes were given their own visual design distinct from the other Covenant. Weaponry was designed to reflect the Brute's \"souls\" distilled to its purest form—conveyed by dangerous shapes, harsh colors, and objects that looked \"dangerous to be around\". A UNSC weapon designed for \"Combat Evolved\" in 1999 that was discarded at the time was re-purposed as the Brute's \"Mauler\" weapon.\n\nCovenant society is a caste system composed of many races, some of which were forcibly incorporated. Each race is required to provide a specific number of troops to remain within the Covenant. In the games, the races are identified by their common UNSC designation; their Covenant names are supplied by the \"Halo 2\" Limited Edition and \"Halo 3\" Limited Edition manuals and several novels.\n\nThe majority of events in the story arc of the \"Halo\" series occur during the \"Ninth Age of Reclamation.\" The Covenant's organization of time and dates is not elaborated on in detail in the game or during any of the novelizations; Bungie cinematic director Joseph Staten, in an interview on \"Halo\" fansite halo.bungie.org, said that the Covenant's date system is split into seven epochs, split into the following Ages: Abandonment, Conflict, Discovery, Reconciliation, Conversion, Doubt, and Reclamation.\n\nThe 2001 and 2007 novels \"\" and \"\" describe humanity's first contact with the Covenant in the year 2525. In \"The Fall of Reach\", a lone Covenant ship bombards the Harvest colony with plasma, turning the planet's crust into molten glass. The lone ship, broadcasts the Covenant edict, \"Your destruction is the will of the gods, and we are their instrument\", and destroys several United Nations Space Command (UNSC) ships sent to attack it. \"Contact Harvest\" describes a lengthy ground engagement between human militia and Covenant before the total assault on Harvest. The Covenant claim that humans are an offense to their gods, but in reality, three Covenant Prophets have learned from a relic left by their gods, the Forerunners, that humans, who may possibly be genetically related to the Forerunners, have been chosen by the Forerunners as their Reclaimers. Realizing such a revelation would splinter the Covenant, the newly crowned Hierarchs decide to obliterate the humans instead and declare that a new Age of the Covenant has begun.\n\nThe Covenant's superior technology allow them to annihilate the outer human colonies within four years; the Covenant begin to destroy the inner colonies soon thereafter. As a defensive measure, the UNSC creates the \"Cole Protocol\"; human ships are prohibited from directly traveling to human worlds to avoid detection by the Covenant, and destruction of a ship's navigation databases and artificial intelligence if threatened with capture. In 2552, the Covenant track the UNSC ship \"Iroquois\" to the world of Reach, Earth's most well-defended colony, by a hidden transmitter. A massive Covenant fleet arrives at Reach and lays waste to much of the planet.\n\nThe Covenant's first appearance in the video games is in \"\" (2001), which picks up towards the end of \"The Fall of Reach\". A detachment of Covenant follow the human vessel \"Pillar of Autumn\" from Reach to Halo, a ring-shaped Forerunner relic that the Covenant believe sacred. Wary of accidentally damaging the ring, the Covenant are forced to fight the humans on foot, and accidentally release the Flood. The Flood, a virulent parasite that infests sentient life, attack human and Covenant alike and threaten to capture a Covenant cruiser to escape their prison on Halo. Meanwhile, the human \"Spartan\" supersoldier Master Chief detonates the \"Pillar of Autumn\"s engines, destroying the ring and the Covenant armada. The novelization of the game, \"\" (2003), describes additional events not seen in the game. In the novel \"First Strike\", The Master Chief, survivors of the \"Autumn\" and surviving Spartans from Reach destroy a Covenant fleet they learn is preparing to strike Earth, and race home to warn of the impending attack.\n\nIn the video game \"Halo 2\" (2004), a member of the Covenant Prophet triumvirate, Regret, arrives at Earth with a fleet. Most of his fleet is destroyed; Regret's ship flees to another ring, Delta Halo, and is followed by the human ship \"In Amber Clad\" and the Master Chief aboard her. The Chief kills Regret before the majority of the Covenant fleet arrives at Delta Halo, along with the Covenant's holy city of \"High Charity\". The death of Regret leads the remaining Prophets to promote the Brutes as their guards, replacing the Elites. The Elites, outraged, threaten to resign from the Covenant high council; in turn the Prophets give the Brutes \"carte blanche\" to kill the Elites, sparking a civil war. In the midst of these developments, the Flood are again released; the High Prophet Mercy is killed by the parasite, while the last remaining leader, Truth, flees to Earth in a Forerunner ship, entrusting the activation of Halo to the Brute Tartarus. The Elites ally with the humans of \"In Amber Clad\" to stop the firing of the ring, but inadvertently set all the remaining Halo rings to be remotely activated from a location known as the Ark, placed outside the range of the Halo Array to protect certain species from the firing of the Halo rings, built as a foundry for the rings including replacing any that get destroyed.\n\nBy the events of \"Halo 3\" (2007), the Flood intelligence known as the Gravemind infests and captures \"High Charity\", while the Elites assist humans on Earth in defending themselves. Truth's forces excavate a portal to the Ark, located outside the Milky Way. The Elites chase Truth, and the Covenant Arbiter (a holy warrior) kills Truth ultimately ending the Covenant. After the Flood controlled \"High Charity\" arrives at the Ark, the Arbiter and Master Chief decide to activate a partially built Halo ring (the replacement for the ring that the Master Chief destroyed in the first game) destroying the Flood and sparing the rest of the galaxy. The remaining humans and Elites escape back through the portal. The Human-Covenant war ends in December 2552, and the Arbiter leads his Elites back to their homeworld.\n\nA rogue splinter faction of the former Covenant were featured in \"Halo 4\" (2012). This group was led by the Elite Jul 'Mdama. This faction still follows the ideology of the old Covenant religion and seeks to find a powerful weapon on Requiem, the fictional planet on which the majority of \"Halo 4\" is set.\n\nJul 'Mdama's faction also appears in Halo 5: Guardians, although they are not the game's main antagonists.\n\nThe Covenant made a cameo in \"Halo Wars 2\" with a flashback of how Atriox betrayed them and formed the Banished.\n\nThe reception of the Covenant as enemies in \"Combat Evolved\" was generally favorable. The ability to experience the storyline of \"Halo 2\" from the Covenant perspective was described as a \"brilliant stroke of game design\". Allowing the player to assume the role of an Elite was described as providing an unexpected plot twist, and allowing the player to experience a \"newfound complexity to the story\". In addition, some reviewers thought that this provided the series with a significant plot element—IGN referred to it as the \"intriguing side story of the Arbiter and his Elites\"—and its elimination in \"Halo 3\" was pointed to as responsible for reducing the role of the Arbiter within the series plot. In 2010 IGN ranked Covenant 26th in the \"Top 100 Videogames Villains\".\n\n"}

{"id": "383564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=383564", "title": "Domingo Faustino Sarmiento", "text": "Domingo Faustino Sarmiento\n\nDomingo Faustino Sarmiento (February 15, 1811 – September 11, 1888) was an Argentine activist, intellectual, writer, statesman and the seventh President of Argentina. His writing spanned a wide range of genres and topics, from journalism to autobiography, to political philosophy and history. He was a member of a group of intellectuals, known as the \"Generation of 1837\", who had a great influence on nineteenth-century Argentina. He was particularly concerned with educational issues and was also an important influence on the region's literature.\n\nSarmiento grew up in a poor but politically active family that paved the way for much of his future accomplishments. Between 1843 and 1850 he was frequently in exile, and wrote in both Chile and in Argentina. His greatest literary achievement was \"Facundo\", a critique of Juan Manuel de Rosas, that Sarmiento wrote while working for the newspaper \"El Progreso\" during his exile in Chile. The book brought him far more than just literary recognition; he expended his efforts and energy on the war against dictatorships, specifically that of Rosas, and contrasted enlightened Europe—a world where, in his eyes, democracy, social services, and intelligent thought were valued—with the barbarism of the \"gaucho\" and especially the \"caudillo\", the ruthless strongmen of nineteenth-century Argentina.\n\nWhile president of Argentina from 1868 to 1874, Sarmiento championed intelligent thought—including education for children and women—and democracy for Latin America. He also took advantage of the opportunity to modernize and develop train systems, a postal system, and a comprehensive education system. He spent many years in ministerial roles on the federal and state levels where he travelled abroad and examined other education systems.\n\nSarmiento died in Asunción, Paraguay, at the age of 77 from a heart attack. He was buried in Buenos Aires. Today, he is respected as a political innovator and writer. Miguel de Unamuno considered him among the greatest writers of Castilian prose.\n\nSarmiento was born in Carrascal, a poor suburb of San Juan, Argentina on February 15, 1811. His father, José Clemente Quiroga Sarmiento y Funes, had served in the military during the wars of independence, returning prisoners of war to San Juan. His mother, Doña Paula Zoila de Albarracín e Irrázabal, was a very pious woman, who lost her father at a young age and was left with very little to support herself. As a result, she took to selling her weaving in order to afford to build a house of her own. On September 21, 1801, José and Paula were married. They had 15 children, 9 of whom died; Domingo was the only son to survive to adulthood. Sarmiento was greatly influenced by his parents, his mother who was always working hard, and his father who told stories of being a patriot and serving his country, something Sarmiento strongly believed in. In Sarmiento's own words:\n\n\"I was born in a family that lived long years in mediocrity bordering on destitution, and which is to this day poor in every sense of the word. My father is a good man whose life has nothing remarkable except [for his] having served in subordinate positions in the War of Independence... My mother is the true figure of Christianity in its purest sense; with her, trust in Providence was always the solution to all difficulties in life.\"\n\nAt the age of four, Sarmiento was taught to read by his father and his uncle, José Eufrasio Quiroga Sarmiento, who later became Bishop of Cuyo. Another uncle who influenced him in his youth was Domingo de Oro, a notable figure in the young Argentine Republic who was influential in bringing Juan Manuel de Rosas to power. Though Sarmiento did not follow de Oro's political and religious leanings, he learned the value of intellectual integrity and honesty. He developed scholarly and oratorical skills, qualities which de Oro was famous for.\nIn 1816, at the age of five, Sarmiento began attending the primary school \"La Escuela de la Patria\". He was a good student, and earned the title of First Citizen (\"Primer Ciudadano\") of the school. After completing primary school, his mother wanted him to go to Córdoba to become a priest. He had spent a year reading the Bible and often spent time as a child helping his uncle with church services, but Sarmiento soon became bored with religion and school, and got involved with a group of aggressive children. Sarmiento's father took him to the Loreto Seminary in 1821, but for reasons unknown, Sarmiento did not enter the seminary, returning instead to San Juan with his father. In 1823, the Minister of State, Bernardino Rivadavia, announced that the six top pupils of each state would be selected to receive higher education in Buenos Aires. Sarmiento was at the top of the list in San Juan, but it was then announced that only ten pupils would receive the scholarship. The selection was made by lot, and Sarmiento was not one of the scholars whose name was drawn.\n\nIn 1826, an assembly elected Bernardino Rivadavia as president of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. This action roused the ire of the provinces, and civil war was the result. Support for a strong, centralized Argentine government was based in Buenos Aires, and gave rise to two opposing groups. The wealthy and educated of the Unitarian Party, such as Sarmiento, favored centralized government. In opposition to them were the Federalists, who were mainly based in rural areas and tended to reject European mores. Numbering figures such as Manuel Dorrego and Juan Facundo Quiroga among their ranks, they were in favor of a loose federation with more autonomy for the individual provinces.\n\nOpinion of the Rivadavia government was divided between the two ideologies. For Unitarians like Sarmiento, Rivadavia's presidency was a positive experience. He set up a European-staffed university and supported a public education program for rural male children. He also supported theater and opera groups, publishing houses and a museum. These contributions were considered as civilizing influences by the Unitarians, but they upset the Federalist constituency. Common laborers had their salaries subjected to a government cap, and the \"gauchos\" were arrested by Rivadavia for vagrancy and forced to work on public projects, usually without pay.\n\nIn 1827, the Unitarians were challenged by Federalist forces. After the resignation of Rivadavia, Manuel Dorrego was installed as governor of Buenos Aires province. He quickly made peace with Brazil but, on returning to Argentina, was overthrown and executed by the Unitarian general Juan Lavalle, who took Dorrego's place. However, Lavalle did not spend long as governor either: he was soon overthrown by militias composed largely of \"gauchos\" led by Rosas and Estanislao López. By the end of 1829 the old legislature that Lavalle had disbanded was back in place and had appointed Rosas as governor of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe first time Sarmiento was forced to leave home was with his uncle, José de Oro, in 1827, because of his military activities. José de Oro was a priest who had fought in the Battle of Chacabuco under General San Martín. Together, Sarmiento and de Oro went to San Francisco del Monte, in the neighbour province of San Luis. He spent much of his time with his uncle learning and began to teach at the only school in town. Later that year, his mother wrote to him asking him to come home. Sarmiento refused, only to receive a response from his father that he was coming to collect him. His father had persuaded the governor of San Juan to send Sarmiento to Buenos Aires to study at the College of Moral Sciences (\"Colegio de Ciencias Morales\").\n\nSoon after Sarmiento's return, the province of San Juan broke out into civil war and Facundo Quiroga invaded Sarmiento's town. As historian William Katra describes this \"traumatic experience\":\n\nUnable to attend school in Buenos Aires due to the political turmoil, Sarmiento chose to fight against Quiroga. He joined and fought in the unitarian army, only to be placed under house arrest when San Juan was eventually taken over by Quiroga after the battle of Pilar. He was later released, only to join the forces of General Paz, a key unitarian figure.\n\nFighting and war soon resumed, but, one by one, Quiroga vanquished the main allies of General Paz, including the Governor of San Juan, and in 1831 Sarmiento fled to Chile. He did not return to Argentina for five years. At the time, Chile was noted for its good public administration, its constitutional organization, and the rare freedom to criticize the regime. In Sarmiento's view, Chile had \"Security of property, the continuation of order, and with both of these, the love of work and the spirit of enterprise that causes the development of wealth and prosperity.\"\n\nAs a form of freedom of expression, Sarmiento began to write political commentary. In addition to writing, he also began teaching in Los Andes. Due to his innovative style of teaching, he found himself in conflict with the governor of the province. He founded his own school in Pocuro as a response to the governor. During this time, Sarmiento fell in love and had an illegitimate daughter named Ana Faustina, who Sarmiento did not acknowledge until she married.\n\nIn 1836, Sarmiento returned to San Juan, seriously ill with typhoid fever; his family and friends thought he would die upon his return, but he recovered and established an anti-federalist journal called \"El Zonda\". The government of San Juan did not like Sarmiento's criticisms and censored the magazine by imposing an unaffordable tax upon each purchase. Sarmiento was forced to cease publication of the magazine in 1840. He also founded a school for girls during this time called the Santa Rosa High School, which was a preparatory school. In addition to the school, he founded a Literary Society.\n\nIt is around this time that Sarmiento became associated with the so-called \"Generation of 1837\". This was a group of activists, who included Esteban Echeverría, Juan Bautista Alberdi, and Bartolomé Mitre, who spent much of the 1830s to 1880s first agitating for and then bringing about social change, advocating republicanism, free trade, freedom of speech, and material progress. Though, based in San Juan, Sarmiento was absent from the initial creation of this group, in 1838 he wrote to Alberdi seeking the latter's advice; and in time he would become the group most fervent supporter.\n\nIn 1840, after being arrested and accused of conspiracy, Sarmiento was forced into exile in Chile again. It was en route to Chile that, in the baths of Zonda, he wrote the graffiti \"On ne tue point les idées,\" an incident that would later serve as the preface to his book \"Facundo\". Once on the other side of the Andes, in 1841 Samiento started writing for the Valparaíso newspaper \"El Mercurio\", as well working as a publisher of the \"Crónica Contemporánea de Latino América\" (\"Contemporary Latin American Chronicle\"). In 1842, Sarmiento was appointed the Director of the first Normal School in South America; the same year he also founded the newspaper \"El Progreso\". During this time he sent for his family from San Juan to Chile. In 1843, Sarmiento published \"Mi Defensa\" (\"My Defence\"), while continuing to teach. And in May 1845, \"El Progreso\" started the serial publication of the first edition of his best-known work, \"Facundo\"; in July, \"Facundo\" appeared in book form.\n\nBetween the years 1845 and 1847, Sarmiento travelled on behalf of the Chilean government across parts of South America to Uruguay, Brazil, to Europe, France, Spain, Algeria, Italy, Armenia, Switzerland, England, to Cuba, and to North America, the United States and Canada in order to examine different education systems and the levels of education and communication. Based on his travels, he wrote the book \"Viajes por Europa, África, y América\" which was published in 1849.\n\nIn 1848, Sarmiento voluntarily left to Chile once again. During the same year, he met widow Benita Martínez Pastoriza, married her, and adopted her son, Domingo Fidel, or Dominguito, who would be killed in action during the War of the Triple Alliance at Curupaytí in 1866. Sarmiento continued to exercise the idea of freedom of the press and began two new periodicals entitled \"La Tribuna\" and \"La Crónica\" respectively, which strongly attacked Juan Manuel de Rosas. During this stay in Chile, Sarmiento's essays became more strongly opposed to Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Argentine government tried to have Sarmiento extradited from Chile to Argentina, but the Chilean government refused to hand him over.\n\nIn 1850, he published both \"Argirópolis\" and \"Recuerdos de Provincia\" (Recollections of a Provincial Past). In 1852, Rosas's regime was finally brought down. Sarmiento became involved in debates about the country's new constitution.\n\nIn 1854, Sarmiento briefly visited Mendoza, just across the border from Chile in Western Argentina, but he was arrested and imprisoned. Upon his release, he went back to Chile. But in 1855 he put an end to what was now his \"self-imposed\" exile in Chile: he arrived in Buenos Aires, soon to become editor-in-chief of the newspaper \"El Nacional\". He was also appointed town councillor in 1856, and 1857 he joined the provincial Senate, a position he held until 1861.\n\nIt was in 1861, shortly after Mitre became Argentine president, that Sarmiento left Buenos Aires and returned to San Juan, where he was elected governor, a post he took up in 1862. It was then that he passed the \"Statutory Law of Public Education\", making it mandatory for children to attend primary school. It allowed for a number of institutions to be opened including secondary schools, military schools and an all-girls school. While governor, he developed roads and infrastructure, built public buildings and hospitals, encouraged agriculture and allowed for mineral mining. He resumed his post as editor of \"El Zonda\". In 1863, Sarmiento fought against the power of the \"caudillo\" of La Rioja and found himself in conflict with the Interior Minister of General Mitre's government, Guillermo Rawson. Sarmiento stepped down as governor of San Juan to become the Plenipotentiary Minister to the United States, where he was sent in 1865, soon after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Moved by the story of Lincoln, Sarmiento ended up writing his book \"Vida de Lincoln\". It was on this trip that Sarmiento received an honorary degree from the University of Michigan. A bust of him stood in the Modern Languages Building at the University of Michigan until multiple student protests prompted its removal. Students installed plaques and painted the bust red to represent the controversies surrounding his policies towards the indigenous people in Argentina. There still stands a statue of Sarmiento at Brown University. While on this trip, he was asked to run for President again. He won, taking office on October 12, 1868.\n\nDomingo Faustino Sarmiento served as President of the Republic of Argentina from 1868–1874, becoming president despite the maneuverings of his predecessor Bartolomé Mitre. According to biographer Allison Bunkley, his presidency \"marks the advent of the middle, or land-owning classes as the pivot power of the nation. The age of the gaucho had ended, and the age of the merchant and cattleman had begun.\" Sarmiento sought to create basic freedoms, and wanted to ensure civil safety and progress for everyone, not just the few. Sarmiento's tour of the United States had given him many new ideas about politics, democracy, and the structure of society, especially when he was the Argentine ambassador to the country from 1865 to 1868. He found New England, specifically the Boston-Cambridge area to be the source of much of his influence, writing in an Argentine newspaper that New England was \"the cradle of the modern republic, the school for all of America.\" He described Boston as \"The pioneer city of the modern world, the Zion of the ancient Puritans ... Europe contemplates in New England the power which in the future will supplant her.\" Not only did Sarmiento evolve political ideas, but also structural ones by transitioning Argentina from a primarily agricultural economy to one focused on cities and industry.\n\nHistorian David Rock notes that, beyond putting an end to caudillismo, Sarmiento's main achievements in government concerned his promotion of education. As Rock reports, \"between 1868 and 1874 educational subsidies from the central government to the provinces quadrupled.\" He established 800 educational and military institutions, and his improvements to the educational system enabled 100,000 children to attend school.\n\nHe also pushed forward modernization more generally, building infrastructure including of telegraph line across the country for improved communications, making it easier for the government in Buenos Aires and the provinces to communicate; modernizing the postal and train systems which he believed to be integral for interregional and national economies, as well as building the Red Line, a train line that would bring goods to Buenos Aires in order to better facilitate trade with Great Britain. By the end of his presidency, the Red Line extended . In 1869, he conducted Argentina's first national census.\n\nThough Sarmiento is well known historically, he was not a popular president. Indeed, Rock judges that \"by and large his administration was a disappointment\". During his presidency, Argentina conducted an unpopular war against Paraguay; at the same time, people were displeased with him for not fighting for the Straits of Magellan from Chile. Although he increased productivity, he increased expenditures, which also negatively affected his popularity. In addition, the arrival of a large influx of European immigrants was blamed for the outbreak of Yellow Fever in Buenos Aires and the risk of civil war. Moreover, Sarmiento's presidency was further marked by ongoing rivalry between Buenos Aires and the provinces. In the war against Paraguay, Sarmiento's adopted son was killed. Sarmiento suffered from immense grief and was thought to never have been the same again.\n\nOn August 22, 1873, Sarmiento was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt, when two Italian anarchist brothers shot at his coach. They had been hired by federal caudillo Ricardo López Jordán. A year later in 1874, he completed his term as President and stepped down, handing his presidency over to Nicolás Avellaneda, his former Minister of Education.\n\nIn 1875, following his term as President, Sarmiento became the General Director of Schools for the Province of Buenos Aires. That same year, he became the Senator for San Juan, a post that he held until 1879, when he became Interior Minister. But he soon resigned, following conflict with the Governor of Buenos Aires, Carlos Tejedor. He then assumed the post of Superintendent General of Schools for the National Education Ministry under President Roca and published \"El Monitor de la Educación Común\", which is a fundamental reference for Argentine education. In 1882, Sarmiento was successful in passing the sanction of Free Education allowing schools to be free, mandatory, and separate from that of religion.\n\nIn May 1888, Sarmiento left Argentina for Paraguay. He was accompanied by his daughter, Ana, and his companion Aurelia Vélez. He died in Asunción on September 11, 1888, from a heart attack, and was buried in Buenos Aires. His tomb at La Recoleta Cemetery lies under a sculpture, a condor upon a pylon, designed by himself and executed by Victor de Pol. Pedro II, the Emperor of Brazil and a great admirer of Sarmiento, sent to his funeral procession a green and gold crown of flowers with a message written in Spanish remembering the highlights of his life: \"Civilization and Barbarism, Tonelero, Monte Caseros, Petrópolis, Public Education. Remembrance and Homage from Pedro de Alcântara.\"\n\nSarmiento was well known for his modernization of the country, and for his improvements to the educational system. He firmly believed in democracy and European liberalism, but was most often seen as a romantic. Sarmiento was well versed in Western philosophy including the works of Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill. He was particularly fascinated with the liberty given to those living in the United States, which he witnessed as a representative of the Peruvian government. He did, however, see pitfalls to liberty, pointing for example to the aftermath of the French Revolution, which he compared to Argentina's own May Revolution. He believed that liberty could turn into anarchy and thus civil war, which is what happened in France and in Argentina. Therefore, his use of the term \"liberty\" was more in reference to a laissez-faire approach to the economy, and religious liberty. Though a Catholic himself, he began to adopt the ideas of separation of church and state modeled after the US. He believed that there should be more religious freedom, and less religious affiliation in schools. This was one of many ways in which Sarmiento tried to connect South America to North America.\n\nSarmiento believed that the material and social needs of people had to be satisfied but not at the cost of order and decorum. He put great importance on law and citizen participation. These ideas he most equated to Rome and to the United States, a society which he viewed as exhibiting similar qualities. In order to civilize the Argentine society and make it equal to that of Rome or the United States, Sarmiento believed in eliminating the caudillos, or the larger landholdings and establishing multiple agricultural colonies run by European immigrants.\n\nComing from a family of writers, orators, and clerics, Domingo Sarmiento placed a great value on education and learning. He opened a number of schools including the first school in Latin America for teachers in Santiago in 1842: \"La Escuela Normal Preceptores de Chile\". He proceeded to open 18 more schools and had mostly female teachers from the USA come to Argentina to instruct graduates how to be effective when teaching. Sarmiento's belief was that education was the key to happiness and success, and that a nation could not be democratic if it was not educated. \"We must educate our rulers,\" he said. \"An ignorant people will always choose Rosas.\"\n\n\nSarmiento was a prolific author. The following is a selection of his other works:\n\n\nThe impact of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento is most obviously seen in the establishment of September 11 as Panamerican Teacher's Day which was done in his honor at the 1943 Interamerican Conference on Education, held in Panama. Today, he is still considered to be Latin America's teacher. In his time, he opened countless schools, created free public libraries, opened immigration, and worked towards a Union of Plate States.\n\nHis impact was not only on the world of education, but also on Argentine political and social structure. His ideas are now revered as innovative, though at the time they were not widely accepted. He was a self-made man and believed in sociological and economic growth for Latin America, something that the Argentine people could not recognize at the time with the soaring standard of living which came with high prices, high wages, and an increased national debt.\n\nThere is a building named in his honor at the Argentine embassy in Washington D.C..\n\nToday, there is a statue in honor of Sarmiento in Boston on the Commonwealth Avenue Mall, between Gloucester and Hereford streets, erected in 1973. There is a square, \"Plaza Sarmiento\" in Rosario, Argentina. One of Rodin's last sculptures was that of Sarmiento which is now in Buenos Aires.\n\n\n\n"}

She is most known for her involvement in Chicago welfare rights campaign of the 1960s. Thurman worked toward welfare rights and reform with a local organization on the north side of the city called J.O.I.N. (Jobs or Income Now), as well as Uptown Voices advocating for quality, affordable housing for low-income people in Uptown, Chicago and its surrounding communities. As President, Dovie worked to empower community members through participation in housing advocacy, development, rehabilitation and management.\n\nDovie Thurman was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1946. She was known as Little Dovie by family and friends after her aunt Dovie Coleman, or Big Dovie. Dovie’s father passed when she was only 1 year old leaving her to be raised by her grandmother. In 1965, after years of living in an all black community in St. Louis, Missouri Thurman and her two children at the time moved back to Chicago where she settled in the Uptown neighborhood. She was 19 years old and married to a man stationed in Vietnam.\n\nThurman began her career as community activist in 1965. That same year, she met Peggy Terry, a white southern migrant worker who relocated to the neighborhood as a civil rights activist, in a storefront office in Uptown. By 1966, a local organization was gaining popularity amongst students sand residents for its efforts of reducing urban poverty. Jobs or Income Now (JOIN) included noted organizers like Rennie Davis, Richard Rothstein, and Casey Hayden lived in Uptown, undertaking the slow and uneven process of pushing locals towards political action. Early successes included a sit-in at the city welfare office, and tenant strikes that resulted in contracts between collectivized renters and landlords. These efforts antagonized most of the local political and social elites. The chapter was permanently relocated to the Uptown neighborhood, focusing attention on a wider range of pressing, and therefore actionable, community issues: welfare, housing conditions, unemployment and police brutality. As more student organizers began to arrive in Chicago, JOIN also welcomed an influx of community members who became a steady force in the organization. Peggy Terry and Candy Hockenberry came to JOIN around the same time, along with Thurman, her aunt Big Dovie, and Virginia Bowers. The five women became fast friends and, together, they formed the core of JOIN’s welfare committee and became the backbone of the organization's housing rights work. Thurman who served as chairperson for the committee recollects her participation with JOIN as her first involvement in the civil rights movement and her first encounter with poor whites. \"I had never seen poor white people,\" says Thurman. After meeting these women she stated, \"We found out we had more in common than we ever thought. It’s because we began to communicate.\" Her involvement with JOIN was an eyeopening experience that allowed for the intersection of two communities to cultivate a movement unprecedented in Uptown.\n\nThurman was highly respected in her community, working as an activist for many social issues, she acknowledges one of her greatest gains as the Welfare, \"Know Your Rights\" campaign in which she traveled to educate people in different communities about the importance on staying informed on the happenings of the system, and how to advocate for yourself within the system. After spending the majority of her life working for civil rights not only in Chicago but also in Alabama and Washington D.C., Thurman decided to document her story of activism in an oral history produced by old friend Studs Terkel. The interview was featured in a series of oral projects featuring community organizers. Thurman’s interview finally shed the emotions and tribulations faced by women like Dovie who humbly fought for years without formal recognition for her works.\n\nThurman’s documentary was produced only a month before her passing. Reporting on the announcement \"The Chicago Tribune\"'s Mary Schmich wrote, \"Thurman gave her own heart away, marching and protesting and speechifying on behalf of poor people, never mind that for years the doctors told her to sit still, lie down, stay quiet. Some politicians would have been happier if she'd obeyed.\" On April 7, 1997 Dovie Thurman died at the age of 51 from heart failure in Chicago, Illinois. Thurman is survived by her three children, James, Kim, and Lynn.\n\nToby Prinz-Dovie Thurman annual award dinner, Northside Action 4 Justice\n"}

Rose was the medical examiner for Dallas County, Texas, at the time of the assassination of John F. Kennedy and he performed autopsies on J. D. Tippit, Lee Harvey Oswald, and Jack Ruby. After being shoved by Kennedy's aides, he stepped aside and allowed Kennedy's body to be removed from Parkland Memorial Hospital without performing an autopsy.\n\nRose was born in Eagle Butte, South Dakota, on September 23, 1926, to Foresta cowboy and rodeo rider and Lena Berghuis Rose. He grew up on a remote ranch 26 miles from Eagle Butte on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. Rose was reported to have ridden his horse five miles to get to school. According to his memoirs, he attended \"one room country grade schools\" before going to high school in Eagle Butte.\n\nIn the spring of 1944, at the end of his junior year, the 17-year-old Rose dropped out of high school and enlisted in the United States Navy where he served on a submarine, the USS \"Sea Devil\", in the Pacific theater of World War II. According to Rose, at the end of hostilities his boat moored in Shanghai and Tsingtao, China, and served as a \"military presence\" patrolling the China Seas. He was discharged from the Navy in 1946, then attended Yankton College from which he graduated with a B.A. 1949. While at Yankton, he met Marilyn Preheim, who was a medical tech student at a nearby hospital. The couple married in the Mennonite Church on July 28, 1951, and eventually had a son and five daughters.\n\nRose studied medicine for two years at the University of South Dakota, then earned his M.D. from the University of Nebraska in 1953. In the mid-1950s, he interned in Denver, Colorado, worked in private practice in Lemmon, South Dakota, then completed specialty training with residencies at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas (surgical pathology) and DePaul Hospital in St. Louis (clinical pathology). Rose then sub-specialized with a residency in forensic pathology at the Medical College of Virginia. He worked as a forensic pathologist in Virginia where he held the title of Deputy Chief Examiner for the Tidewater Region of Virginia.\n\nIn June 1963, Rose moved to Dallas where he became medical examiner for the city and county of Dallas. According to \"The New York Times\", he was \"hired by the county to establish a scientifically valid medical examiner’s system to replace its existing system of elected lay coroners.\" While working as a medical examiner in Dallas, Rose received a law degree from Southern Methodist University.\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Rose was in his office at Parkland Memorial Hospital across the corridor from Trauma Room 1 when he received word that Kennedy was pronounced dead. He walked across the corridor to the trauma room occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy and a priest who had been called in to administer last rites. There, Rose was met by Secret Service agent Roy Kellerman and Kennedy's personal physician George Burkley who told him that there was no time for an autopsy because Mrs. Kennedy would not leave Dallas without her husband's body which was to be delivered promptly to the airport. At the time of the assassination of Kennedy, the murder of a United States President was not covered by federal law. Rose objected, insisting that Texas law required him to perform a post-mortem examination prior to the removal of the body. A heated exchange ensued as he argued with Kennedy's aides. Kennedy's body was placed in a casket and, accompanied by Mrs. Kennedy, rolled down the corridor on a gurney. Rose was reported to have stood in a hospital doorway, backed by a policeman, in an attempt to prevent the removal of the coffin. According to Robert Caro's \"\", the President's aides \"had literally shoved [Rose] and the policeman aside to get out of the building.\" In an interview with \"Journal of the American Medical Association\", Rose stated that he stepped aside feeling that it was unwise to exacerbate the tension.\n\nRose received criticism for arguing with federal officials at Parkland. For his role in the immediate aftermath of the assassination, he was disparaged by William Manchester in his 1967 book \"The Death of a President\". Describing Manchester's portrayal of Rose, Peter Knight wrote: \"If Dallas and Oswald are the overt culprits of the crime, then Earl Rose is the cameo villain of the book.\" According to a 2003 AP report, Rose's son, Forrest, believed that the book \"depicted [Rose] as an unreasonable, petty state bureaucrat with a gripe.\" \"BMJ\" wrote that he was \"portrayed almost comically as a small time official trying to act important; a portrayal most now see as unjustified.\"\n\nIn a 1992 interview published in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\", Rose said, \"The law was broken\" and that \"[a] Texas autopsy would have assured a tight chain of custody on all the evidence.\" In 2003, Rose said he still believed that he and his staff should have been allowed to perform the post-mortem examination of Kennedy and that many conspiracy theories about the assassination would have been quelled had he examined the President.\n\nRose began his autopsy of Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippit at 3:14 pm on November 22. He found bullet entrance wounds on the officer's body: two on the right side of his chest, one in his right temple, and a superficial wound to his left rib. Rose removed the three bullets that had entered Tippit's chest and head, noting that there was massive hemorrhaging as a result of penetration of the lung and liver, as well as a large amount of damage to his brain.\n\nTwo days after the assassination of Kennedy, Rose was called out of church to tend to Oswald, who had been fatally shot by Jack Ruby. Announcing the results of the gross autopsy, Rose said: \"The two things that we could determine were, first, that he died from a hemorrhage from a gunshot wound, and that otherwise he was a physically healthy male.\" His examination found that Ruby's bullet entered Oswald's left side in the front part of the abdomen and caused damage to his spleen, stomach, aorta, vena cava, kidney, liver, diaphragm, and eleventh rib before coming to rest on his right side.\n\nIn 1979, Michael Eddoweswho wrote a book claiming that the man who assassinated Kennedy was a look-alike of Oswald put in place by Soviet secret policefiled suit in Fort Worth, Texas, in order to exhume Oswald's body for verification of its identity. There was reported to have been some controversy regarding Rose's measurement of Oswald's height and that he did not note a mastoidectomy scar which was claimed to exist by others. Rose said he did not object to the exhumation. He was reported to have met Eddowes and to have had \"great respect\" for him.\n\nOn January 3, 1967, Ruby (the murderer of Oswald) died at Parkland Hospital. Rose began the autopsy on Ruby an hour after his death, and a report released the following month indicated that three doctors from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School assisted him in the post-mortem examination. The cause of death was determined to be a lung obstruction due to a massive blood clot. Rose was quoted as saying that the clot originated in one of Ruby's legs and traveled through his heart to the lungs. After what was initially thought to be pneumonia, Ruby was diagnosed with cancer at Parkland in December 1966. Rose indicated that the same type of cancer that affected Ruby's lungs was found in his brain, lymph nodes, liver, pancreas, pleura, ribs, and vertebra. He said that eight tumors were found in his brain, with the largest being three-fourths of an inch. Rose told reporters that he could not definitively answer whether or not the tumors were present in Ruby's brain at the time he shot Oswald, but he indicated metastasis from the lungs to the brain could not have occurred prior to 1964 since X-rays at the county jail that year revealed that his lungs were clear. He added that he found no evidence of epilepsy or other brain abnormalities. Rose stated that his death certificate would note cancer as a contributing cause, but that the clot would likely have killed Ruby even if he had not been weakened by cancer.\n\nIn 1966, Rose performed autopsies on the crew of American Flyers Flight 280 and testified about his findings in a hearing before the Civil Aeronautics Board.\n\nFrom 1968 until his retirement in the early 1992, Rose taught pathology at the University of Iowa. He was an expert witness in the 1977 trial of Robert Williams, who was indicted for the first-degree murder of 10-year-old Pamela Powers. In 1978, he served on the Forensic Pathology Panel of the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations. During their retirement, Rose and his wife worked as small claims court mediators in Johnson County, Iowa.\n\nSuffering from late-onset dementia and Parkinson's disease, Rose lost his long-term memory and the ability to converse over the last year of his life. He contracted a near-fatal case of pneumonia and was bed-ridden prior to his death. On May 1, 2012, Rose died at the Oaknoll Retirement Residence in Iowa City, Iowa from complications due to Parkinson's disease. \n\nRose rejected the idea that there was a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and he supported the Warren Commission's conclusion that a single gunman shot the President. \"The New York Times\" characterized him as \"an outspoken opponent of capital punishment\". According to \"The Des Moines Register\", Rose described himself as a \"'visitor' to the Mennonite faith\".\n\n"}

For a number of years he was a member of the Dutch Senate for the Labour Party, and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He was primarily known as a defender of the rights of paedophiles and an advocate of more lax legislation on public morality.\n\nBrongersma was born in Haarlem as the son of an ophthalmologist. He studied law at the University of Amsterdam (1931–1935) and obtained his degree in 1935. From 1935 to 1937 he was associated with a law firm in Haarlem while working on his doctoral dissertation on the Portuguese constitution of 1933 and Portuguese corporatism of Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, whom he much admired at the time. In 1940 he received his Doctor of Law degree \"cum laude\" from the Catholic University of Nijmegen. His dissertation, on the subject of the corporative state in Portugal, was published as a book and was reprinted several times.\n\nAfter World War II he quickly made a career for himself as a lawyer and politician as well as a prolific writer. He worked as an attorney in Amsterdam from 1940 to 1950, and between 1946 and 1950 he was active within the editorial board of the Dutch journal for the legal profession, Nederlands Juristenblad. In 1946, he was elected to the Dutch Senate for the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA); his term lasted from 1946 to 1950 and later he had a second term, from 1963 to 1977. In the same period (1946–1950), he was a member for the Dutch Labour Party of the Provincial States of North Holland and served on the town council of Heemstede.\n\nHis career was abruptly interrupted in 1950, when he was arrested for having sexual relations with a 17-year-old male. At the time, the age of consent for homosexual contacts was 21, based on article 248bis Dutch Criminal Code. The conviction of Brongersma resulted in 11 months imprisonment.\n\nHe subsequently continued his career in the 1950s as a journalist and critic. From 1953 to 1956, he was a member of the executive committee of the Dutch Labour Party in the Utrecht region. In 1956 he was recruited for a four-year term as director of community work in Haarlem. As a result of his conviction, he had been disbarred in 1950, but re-admitted to the Dutch Bar in 1959. He resumed his legal practice and continued to work as a lawyer until 1980.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1967, he was a senior lecturer at the Criminological Institute of Utrecht University, where he worked very closely with Professor of Law W. Pompe. In 1963, at the request of the Dutch Labour Party, he rejoined the Senate for a second term which would last until his resignation in 1977. From 1969 to 1977 he was chairman and spokesman for the Permanent Senate's Committee for Justice. For his political service, he was made a Companion in the Order of the Dutch Lion on 29 April 1975. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee he functioned from 1969 to 1977.\n\nBrongersma was primarily known for his publications and his advocacy of more liberal morality legislation, a subject in which he was keenly interested. Because of his expertise, he played a major role in 1971 as a member of the Senate in abolishing Article 248bis of the Dutch Criminal Code, the same article on the basis of which he had been convicted in 1950. The age of consent for homosexual contacts was then lowered from 21 to 16 (the same as for heterosexual contacts). He advocated lowering the age of consent even further and allowing young people greater freedom to enter into sexual relations.\n\nIn the course of his lifetime he collected a huge number of scientific and academic publications on these themes, consisting of a library and personal archives. In 1979 he donated them to a foundation bearing his name, the object of which as stated in its articles of association was \"promoting scientific study and publications in the field of sexual relations between adults and young people\". In 1992 the objective was broadened to \"promoting research of the sexual-emotional health of children and young people\".\n\nAfter resigning from the Dutch Senate in 1977, Brongersma devoted himself completely to the objectives of his foundation. It was then that he wrote his magnum opus \"Loving Boys\" (published in two parts, 1987 and 1990), while continuing to expand his collections.\n\nBrongersma published extensively on a wide variety of topics, authoring some 1200 books and articles between 1930 and 1998 on social and philosophical subjects such as criminal law, constitutional law, criminology, philosophy, religion, sexology, legislation on public morals and literary topics. Able to speak ten Western European languages, he has written books on the Civil War in Spain, Portugal and the Portuguese, penal law and social problems. Beginning with his years at the Criminological Institute, he has written extensively in the area of sexology, especially on pornography, ephebophilia, pedophilia and the age of consent. His books on this subjects include: \"Das Verfehmte Geschlecht\" (in German, 1970), \"Sex en Straf\" (\"Sex and Punishment\", 1972), \"Over pedofielen en kinderlokkers\" (\"On Pedophiles and Child Molesters\", 1975), and his last work is his \"magnum opus\" and entitled \"Loving Boys\" (two volumes, 1988–1990).\n\nBrongersma's work and activism regarding pedophilia focused exclusively on homosexual pedophilia between males and admitted several times that he knew little or nothing about heterosexual or lesbian pedophila. Brongersma opposed the other prominent figure in the 1970s pedophile emancipation movement in the Netherlands, psychologist Frits Bernard, who considered pedophilia not pathological irrespective of the gender of the participants.\n\nBrongersma died in 1998 by means of voluntary euthanasia. His health failed and he grew lonely as his best friends died one by one. The social changes that had started in the 1980s, in response to the sexual revolution of the 1970s, caused him to become dispirited. Initially his pleas to liberalise legislation on public morals and the rights of paedophiles had been positively received by some, both in the Netherlands and internationally. But gradually the social climate became less receptive to these ideas. Following his death, discussion flared up in the Netherlands as to whether people who were weary of life should be allowed to end their lives with the aid of a physician. Flip Sutorius, the doctor from Overveen who helped Brongersma in his chosen death, was prosecuted but not punished. The verdict was finally maintained in 2002 by the \"Hoge Raad\" (Dutch Supreme Court).\n\nA great deal of commotion ensued following his death when some of the visual material in his collections was seized. The images were deemed to be child pornography. Legislation passed in 1996 made it an offence to have such pictures \"on hand\".\n\nAfter his death, his entire social-sexuological collections as well as his private archives were placed in the International Institute for Social History (IISG) in Amsterdam (www.iisg.nl), this without the visual material which had been seized by the authorities. The executive board of the foundation continued its activities; in 1998, the \"Fund for Scientific Research of Sexuality\" was set up, with the stated aims of: obtaining more insight into sexual development processes in relation to social, emotional, cognitive and physical development; contributing to sexual health and to helping develop the capacity for relationships, and a sense of responsibility; supporting parents, guardians, educators, teachers, public relations officers and care and welfare workers by effectively channelling the knowledge gained from research; and promoting debate in circles of lawyers, sociologists, government officials and politicians on various social and legal frameworks.\n\nThis article is for a great part based on the archives of dr E. Brongersma, preserved at the International Institute of Social History (IISH), Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n"}
{"id": "26237839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26237839", "title": "Engaged Spirituality", "text": "Engaged Spirituality\n\nEngaged Spirituality refers to religious or spiritual people who actively engage in the world in order to transform it in positive ways while finding nurturance, inspiration and guidance in their spiritual beliefs and practices. The term was inspired by Engaged Buddhism a concept and set of values developed by the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh. Engaged Spirituality encompasses people committed to social change from all the major faith traditions as well as people who refer to themselves as “spiritual but not religious.” It has numerous iterations in practice yet common themes unite the many forms it takes. For some in the Catholic tradition, Liberation Theology guides their form of engaged spirituality.\n\nIndividuals who practice this mode of spirituality tend to hold progressive values that, supported by their spiritual practices galvanize their efforts for social change. They see a deep connection between personal and social transformation such that they feel compelled to engage in organized causes or service activities. Their activities are infused with their spiritual sensibilities regarding how matters of ultimate concern – the overarching context delineated by their faith tradition – are related to daily living, habits and practices. Examples of activities are: peace activism, civil rights and human rights activism for minority groups, environmental activism, and service on behalf of the poor and homeless.\n\nUnlike much of the pop spirituality that is promoted in countless books, audio programs, and internet sites, engaged spirituality maintains a focus on societal transformation. Pop spirituality on the other hand, despite its politically liberal leanings, tends to concern itself primarily with personal, psychological betterment that lacks a deep commitment to social change and activism.\n\nEngaged spirituality involves a synthesis of individual, subjective experiences and outer, collective activities. The individual and the collective mutually support, shape and transform each other. For example, prayer or meditation may serve as a way for an individual to gather strength and gain insight that will guide and enhance the efficacy of their social change efforts. Their experiences gathered in their outer activities – which involve relating to and learning from others – may influence the texture of their prayer or meditation experiences. Thus there is a continual, interwoven process of spiritual growth and reaffirmation to improving one’s local/global community.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "642196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=642196", "title": "Francis II, Duke of Brittany", "text": "Francis II, Duke of Brittany\n\nFrancis II of Brittany (in Breton Frañsez II, in French François II) (23 June 1433 – 9 September 1488) was Duke of Brittany from 1458 to his death. He was the grandson of John IV, Duke of Brittany. A recurring theme in Francis' life would be his quest to maintain the quasi-independence of Brittany from France. As such, his reign was characterized by conflicts with King Louis XI of France and with his daughter, Anne of France, who served as regent during the minority of her brother, King Charles VIII. The armed and unarmed conflicts between 1484–1488 have been called the Mad War (\"la Guerre Folle\") and also the \"War of the Public Weal\".\n\nFrancis II was born on 23 June 1433 to Richard of Brittany, Count of Étampes (1395–1438) and his wife, Margaret of Orléans, Countess of Vertus (1406–1466). Richard of Brittany was the youngest son of Duke John IV of Brittany. Richard's older brothers, John V and Arthur III, both succeeded their father as duke, but upon Arthur's death in 1458, the only legitimate male heir was Francis his nephew.\n\nDuke Francis II unforeseenably became the protector of England's House of Lancaster in exile from 1471–1484.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 15th century, civil war existed in England as the House of York and House of Lancaster fought each other for the English throne. In 1471, the Yorkists defeated their rivals in the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury. The Lancastrian king, Henry VI of England and his only son, Edward of Westminster, died in the aftermath of the Battle of Tewkesbury. Their deaths left the House of Lancaster with no direct claimants to the throne. Subsequently, the Yorkist king, Edward IV of England, was in complete control of England. He attainted those who refused to submit to his rule, such as Jasper Tudor and his nephew Henry Tudor (later King Henry VII of England), naming them as traitors and confiscating their lands.\n\nThe Tudors tried to flee to France but strong winds in the English Channel forced them to land at Le Conquet in Brittany, where they were taken into the custody of Duke Francis II. Henry Tudor, the only remaining Lancastrian noble with a trace of royal bloodline, had a weak claim to the throne, and King Edward IV regarded him as \"a nobody.\" However, Francis II viewed Henry as a valuable tool to bargain for England's aid, when in conflicts with France, and therefore kept the Tudors under his protection. He housed Jasper Tudor, Henry Tudor, and the core of their group of exiled Lancastrians at the Château de Suscinio in Sarzeau, where they remained there for 11 years. There, Francis II generously supported this group of exiled Englishmen against all the Plantagenet demands that he should surrender them.\n\nIn October 1483, Henry Tudor launched a failed invasion of England from Brittany. Duke Francis II supported this invasion by providing 40,000 gold crowns, 15,000 soldiers, and a fleet of transport ships. Henry's fleet of 15 chartered vessels was scattered by a storm, and his ship reached the coast of England in company with only one other vessel. Henry realized that the soldiers on shore were the men of the new Yorkist king, Richard III of England, and so he decided to abandon the invasion and return to Brittany. As for Henry's main conspirator in England, Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, he was convicted of treason and beheaded on 2 November 1483, way before Henry's ships landed in England. For Henry's conspiracy against King Richard III had been unravelled, and without the Duke of Buckingham or Henry Tudor, the rebellion was easily crushed.\n\nSurvivors of the failed uprising then fled to Brittany, where they openly supported Henry Tudor's claim to the throne. On Christmas Day in 1483 at the Rennes Cathedral, Henry swore an oath to marry King Edward IV's daughter, Elizabeth of York, and thus unite the warring houses of York and Lancaster. Henry's rising prominence made him a great threat to King Richard III, and the Yorkist king made several overtures to Duke Francis II to surrender the young Lancastrian. Francis II refused, holding out for the possibility of better terms from the King. In mid-1484, Francis was incapacitated by one of his periods of illness, and while recuperating, his treasurer, Pierre Landais, took over the reins of government. Landais reached an agreement with King Richard III to send Henry and his uncle Jasper back to England in exchange for a pledge of 3,000 English archers to defend Brittany against a threatened French attack. John Morton, a bishop of Flanders, learned of the scheme and warned the Tudors in time. The Tudors then managed to separately escape, hours ahead of Landais' soldiers, across the nearby border into France. They were received at the court of King Charles VIII of France who allowed them to stay and provided them with resources. Shortly afterwards, when Francis II had recovered, he offered the 400 remaining Lancastrians, still at and around the Château de Suscinio, safe-conduct into France and even paid for their expenses. For the French, the Tudors were useful pawns to ensure that King Richard III did not interfere with French plans to acquire Brittany. Thus, the loss of the Lancastrians seriously played against the interests of Francis II.\n\nCirca 1136, King Stephen of England named Alan of Penthièvre of Brittany (also known as Alan the Black) the 1st Earl of Richmond. After Alan, the title and its possessions (the Honour of Richmond) were typically bestowed upon the Dukes of Brittany, with a few interruptions, through the ducal reign of John IV, which ended in 1399. After John IV, the English kings would bestow the title Earl of Richmond on nobles other than the Dukes of Brittany, including Edmund Tudor, Henry Tudor's father. However the dukes of Brittany from John V through Francis II would continue to use the titulary Earl of Richmond. It is possible that Francis willed whatever remained of his claims to the earldom and the Honour of Richmond to Henry Tudor. On successfully gaining the English crown after the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, Henry VII merged the earldom and its possessions into the crown.\n\nLouis XI was renowned as a cunning adversary and a master at diplomacy, if not the military arts. His contemporary nickname was \"The Universal Spider,\" reflecting his constant political plotting.\n\nFrancis II became a member of the League of the Public Weal. This was an alliance of feudal nobles organized in 1465 in defiance of the centralized authority of King Louis XI of France, whose declared aim was to enlarge the French royal domain by annexing all of the duchies – Burgundy, Berry, Normandy, Orléans, Brittany, etc. It was masterminded by Charles the Bold, Count of Charolais, son of the Duke of Burgundy, with the king's brother Charles, Duke of Berry, as a figurehead.\n\nIn 1467 Charles the Bold inherited the Duchy of Burgundy, which held fiefs in France that included the counties of Artois and Flanders, and the Imperial lands of Holland, Brabant, and Luxembourg. As Duke of Burgundy, Charles aspired to forge a kingdom of his own between France and Germany, approximating the former domains of the Frankish Emperor Lothair I. In pursuit of this goal, Charles was killed in 1477 at the Battle of Nancy against René II, Duke of Lorraine and a hired army of Swiss mercenaries, and Louis was saved from his greatest adversary. The great Duchy of Burgundy was then absorbed into the Kingdom of France, and the League of the Public Weal was essentially defeated, although several members would re-ally for the Mad War in 1485.\n\nThe fortunes of Francis II and Brittany would continue to suffer after Louis XI's death in 1483, as Louis' daughter Anne of France would serve as regent for his successor, Charles VIII.\n\nFrancis II was anxious to maintain his duchy's autonomy during the minority of Charles VIII of France. He aligned himself with Louis, the Duke of Orléans (the future Louis XII) and Charles, Count of Angoulême, against the regency of Anne of France. Anne had been pursuing the same underhand politics as her father, Louis XI, towards Brittany.\n\nIn focusing on relations with his neighbour France, however, Francis II neglected his own realm. His corrupt and oppressive prime minister, Guillaume Chauvin, was overthrown by treasurer general Pierre Landais in 1477. A large part of the nobility had been bribed by Anne and Charles and supported them in their eagerness to subjugate Brittany. These nobles performed a \"coup d'état\" against Landais, who was eventually hanged in 1485.\n\nIn 1486, the Estates of Brittany confirmed the succession of Brittany on Francis' daughter Anne, to further assure the Duchy's autonomy from France. The Treaty of Chateaubriant was signed with France in 1487 and reaffirmed Brittany's autonomy. Despite the Treaty of Chateaubriant, however, the French continued to harass the Duchy. Under the leadership of Louis II de la Trémoille, the French royal army struck against Vannes and Fougères, controlling access to Brittany.\n\nFrancis II then allied with Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, against France. Alain d'Albret, a rebel lord, believing he would marry Francis' daughter Anne, reinforced the Breton army with 5000 troops supplied by the king of Spain. Maximilian I of Austria also sent 1500 men, and Edward Woodville, Lord Scales, brought over a force of archers from Britain. However Brittany was defeated 28 July 1488 in the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier. This battle also destroyed the power-base of the warring noble leaders as Edward Woodville was killed, and Louis of Orléans and Jean, Prince of Orange were captured. Alain d'Albret and the Maréchal de Rieux succeeded in escaping, and played an important part in continuing the conflict.\n\nA few days later, on 10 August, Francis was forced to sign the Treaty of Verger. Under the terms of the treaty, the duke was compelled to submit himself and his duchy as a vassal of the king of France, and to expel foreign princes and troops from Brittany. It also restricted his ability to marry his children to suitors of his choosing and required that he cede territory in Saint-Malo, Fougères, Dinan, and Saint-Aubin to the king as a guarantee that in the absence of a male successor the king would determine the succession. Francis died a few months later as a result of a fall from his horse during a leisurely ride. He left only a daughter, Anne of Brittany, so the treaty was used to force her, as his successor, to marry Charles VIII, and later Louis XII. Despite the French victory and the signing of the treaty, la Guerre Folle dragged on beyond Francis II's death for three more years until December 1491, when Anne married Charles VIII.\n\nFrancis II is interred in an elaborate tomb in the Nantes Cathedral. His tomb was commissioned by his daughter Anne, and is an important early example of Renaissance sculpture in France.\n\nFrancis II was married twice.\n\nHis first wife was Margaret of Brittany, the eldest daughter of Francis I, Duke of Brittany (his first cousin) and Isabella of Scotland. They had one son who died shortly after his birth: \n\nHis second wife was Margaret of Foix, Princess of Navarre, daughter of Gaston IV, Count of Foix and Queen Eleanor of Navarre. They had two children:\n\nFrancis II also had five illegitimate children with Antoinette de Maignelais, the former mistress of King Charles VII of France.\n\nBreton nobles acted to safeguard Anne as their Duchess and to protect the Duchy's autonomy for which Francis had fought so hard. In 1489 these nobles signed the Treaty of Redon with Henry VII; that treaty between Brittany and England was intended to prevent the annexation of Brittany by France. However, in 1491 Charles VIII of France invaded Brittany and forced Anne to marry him, thereby gaining control of the duchy. Then in 1492 Henry VII signed the Treaty of Etaples with France, effectively removing England's defense of Breton autonomy in return for promises from the French to no longer support Perkin Warbeck, pretender to the English throne, and to pay a war indemnity. The duchy's autonomy was all but lost as the process of merging it into the French crown began, and Brittany's strongest ally was neutralized. Anne, however, would become a formidable Queen Consort and would fight to preserve Brittany's autonomy and Francis II's legacy for herself, the Breton people, and her descendants.\n\n\n"}

Germany’s responsibility for the sinking was suppressed by Admiral Karl Dönitz and the Nazi propaganda. Lemp died on 9 May 1941 when the U-boat he commanded was captured.\n\nOn 3 September 1939, while in command of U-30, he sank the 13,581 ton passenger ship , the first British ship sunk in World War II. Lemp later claimed that the fact she was steering a zigzag course which seemed to be well off the normal shipping routes made him believe she was either a troopship or an armed merchant cruiser; when he realized his error he took the first steps to conceal the facts by omitting to make an entry in the submarine's log, and swearing his crew to secrecy. Adolf Hitler decided the incident should be kept secret for political reasons, and the German newspaper \"Völkischer Beobachter\" published an article which blamed the loss of the \"Athenia\" on the British, accusing Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, of sinking the ship to turn neutral opinion against Nazi Germany. The truth did not emerge until January 1946 at the Nuremberg trials, during the case against Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, when a statement by Admiral Dönitz was read in which he admitted that \"Athenia\" had been torpedoed by \"U-30\" and every effort had been made to cover it up, including ordering Lemp to alter his log book.\n\n\"U-110\" was captured on 9 May 1941 in the North Atlantic south of Iceland by the destroyers , HMS \"Broadway\" and the British corvette . After depth charges forced the boat to the surface, where she was shelled, Lemp ordered the crew to abandon ship and open the vents in order to sink the crippled U-boat.\n\nLemp was not among the 34 survivors rescued by the Allied vessels, and one account of his fate has him swimming back to the submarine when he realized that the scuttling charges were not going to detonate and either being shot and killed by the boarding party or drowning in the icy water. After the war the Germans claimed that Lemp had been shot in the water, either by Sub-Lieutenant Balme's boarding party from HMS \"Bulldog\" or from the \"Bulldog\". Balme, however, assured German journalists that no shot had been fired at any time by his party. Joe Baker-Cresswell, commander of the \"Bulldog\", also denied that Lemp had been shot, and the official British explanation remains that Lemp committed suicide by drowning when he realized the consequences of his failure.\nBalme's party boarded the U-boat, capturing an intact Enigma machine and the code books, which would contribute to the deciphering of German military codes by British intelligence based at Bletchley Park.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26266653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26266653", "title": "Frustration", "text": "Frustration\n\nIn psychology, frustration is a common emotional response to opposition, related to anger, annoyance and disappointment, frustration arises from the perceived resistance to the fulfillment of an individual's will or goal and is likely to increase when a will or goal is denied or blocked. There are two types of frustration; internal and external. Internal frustration may arise from challenges in fulfilling personal goals, desires, instinctual drives and needs, or dealing with perceived deficiencies, such as a lack of confidence or fear of social situations. Conflict, such as when one has competing goals that interfere with one another, can also be an internal source of frustration and can create cognitive dissonance. External causes of frustration involve conditions outside an individual's control, such as a physical roadblock, a difficult task, or the perception of wasting time. There are multiple ways individuals cope with frustration such as passive–aggressive behavior, anger, or violence, although frustration may also propel positive processes via enhanced effort and strive. This broad range of potential outcomes makes it difficult to identify the original cause(s) of frustration, as the responses may be indirect. However, a more direct and common response is a propensity towards aggression.\n\nFrustration originates from feelings of uncertainty and insecurity which stems from a sense of inability to fulfill needs. If the needs of an individual are blocked, uneasiness and frustration are more likely to occur. When these needs are constantly ignored or unsatisfied, anger, depression, loss of self-confidence, annoyance, aggression, and sometimes violence are likely to follow. Needs can be blocked two different ways; internally and externally. Internal blocking happens within an individual's mind, either through lack of ability, confidence, conflicting goals and desires, and/or fears. External blocking happens to an individual outside their control such as physical roadblocks, difficult tasks, or perceived waste of time.\n\nSome people are predisposed towards feelings of frustration, indexed in terms of temperament (frustration), in adolescence and neuroticism in adulthood. Temperamental frustration is associated with perceptual alterations including changes in perceived relationship affection.\n\nFrustration can be considered a problem–response behavior and can have a number of effects, depending on the mental health of the individual. In positive cases, this frustration will build until a level that is too great for the individual to contain or allow to continue, and thus produce action directed at solving the inherent problem in a disposition that does not cause social or physical harm. In negative cases, however, the individual may perceive the source of frustration to be outside their control, and thus the frustration will continue to build, leading eventually to further problematic behavior (e.g. violent reaction against perceived oppressors or enemies).\n\nStubborn refusal to respond to new conditions affecting the goal, such as removal or modification of the barrier, sometimes occurs. As pointed out by J.A.C. Brown, severe punishment may cause individuals to continue non-adaptive behavior blindly: \"Either it may have an effect opposite to that of reward and as such, discourage the repetition of the act, or, by functioning as a frustrating agent, it may lead to fixation and the other symptoms of frustration as well. It follows that punishment is a dangerous tool, since it often has effects which are entirely the opposite of those desired\".\n\nFrustration tolerance is one's ability to resist becoming frustrated when facing difficult tasks. Having a low frustration tolerance is related to trait anger and a higher level of frustration tolerance is related to lower levels of anger and longer persistence on difficult tasks. For example, a child with a high frustration tolerance may be able to deal with repeated challenges and failures without experiencing significant frustration. The child with a low frustration tolerance can be quick to experience frustration when asked to perform tasks of moderate difficulty.\n\n\nFrustration \n"}

He is best known as the second husband of Vipsania, eldest daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and first wife of Tiberius, who ultimately imprisoned him.\n\nIn 11 BC he married Vipsania Agrippina, daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and his first wife Caecilia Attica, and the former wife of Tiberius. Their union proved fruitful and produced at least six children. Gallus also claimed true paternity of Julius Caesar Drusus, earning him Tiberius' animosity. If Gallus' claim was true, he might also have been the father of the child Vipsania was expecting on her divorce. \n\nHe is mentioned among the speakers at the senate meeting discussing Augustus' funeral in 14; on the subject of last honours he proposed that the funeral train should pass under a triumphal gateway. When the senate met to discuss the transfer of power, Gallus made a joke at Tiberius' expense; when Tiberius remarked he would undertake charge of whichever department was assigned to him, Gallus responded by asking him to choose whichever he wishes. This embarrassed Tiberius publicly, and although Gallus attempted to quell the emperor's anger, he was unsuccessful.\n\nIn 30, he was arrested on Tiberius' order. At Tiberius' instigation, the Senate declared Gallus a public enemy, and he was held in conditions of solitary confinement: \"He had no companion or servant with him, spoke to no one, and saw no one, except when he was compelled to take food. And the food was of such quality and amount as neither to afford him any satisfaction or strength nor yet to allow him to die.\"\n\nHe died in prison of starvation in the year 33 (others mistakenly say 30). When Agrippina died in October of that same year, Tiberius accused her of \"having had Asinius Gallus as a paramour and being driven by his death to loathe existence\". His name was erased from public monuments (a practice known as \"damnatio memoriae\"), though they were restored after Tiberius' death.\n\nAsinius Gallus' marriage to Vispania (11 BC) produced the following known children:\n\n\nIn the BBC television series I, Claudius, Gallus is portrayed by Charles Kay.\n\nIn Lloyd C Douglas's novel \"The Robe\", Gallus is furnished with a fictional daughter Diana, the love interest of the story.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55281799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55281799", "title": "Gapjil", "text": "Gapjil\n\nGapjil (Hangul: 갑질) refers to the arrogant and authoritarian attitude or actions of people in South Korea who have positions of power over others. Gapjil is a neologism made by combining the word Gap (갑; 甲)—which is used to introduce the first party in a contract, but also refers to a party's superior status—and jil (-질), a suffix that negatively refers to particular actions. It is a phenomenon associated with the hierarchical nature of Korean society and work culture—a structure which results in the social superiority of those with higher wealth. Various incidents, such as the nut rage, have brought this phenomenon to the attention of the world media.\n\nSong Jae-ryung, a professor of sociology at Kyunghee University, points out that Gapjil is not simply a matter of an individual's morality, but a societal problem. As the bottom of Korean society is constituted by the repressive role of Gap and submissive attitude of Eul, individuals follow the culture of the elite. In other words, the cause of gapjil is a cultural tendency for people to merely perform the roles which are shaped by the high power distance in Korea. This is why an individual who was Eul in another situation is doing the same thing (gapjil) in another relationship when he or she becomes another Gap. In order to solve the gapjil problem, Prof. Song says, each individual needs to admit the social position that is different horizontally, not vertically, and the social atmosphere that fosters this awareness needs to be formed.\n\nAccording to an article in Economic Review, a Korean magazine, there are some obvious types of gapjil depending on the context: owner gapjil, push-driven distribution gapjil, and passion-pay.\n\n'Owner gapjil' is the most common type of gapjil, where representatives or executive family members of a company treat their employees with contempt, using abusive language or even assault. Owner gapjil reflects the mistaken view that employers can treat employees however they want because of the extreme vertical relationship between the two.\n\nOn 23 December 2015, there was a report that Kim Man-sik, honorary president of Monggo Food, had used abusive language and assaulted his chauffeur 'B'. The assaulted employee said, \"President Kim indulges in violence and hurl abuses almost like a habit, if his mood is bad\". After Monggo Food posted an apology on its website on 23 December, Kim Man-sik and Kim Hyeon-seung, CEO of the firm, apologized to the public and to the person directly involved, on 25 December in a press conference. Although there had been a disagreement with victims concerning a problem of reinstatement, an amicable settlement was made with the victims of the assault. On 19 April 2016, the Masan Branch of the Changwon District Public Prosecutor's Office requested that Kim Man-sik issue a summary order of 7,000,000 won (about 6,000 dollars as of July 2018) in fines relating to habitual assaults, violence and violation of labour standards.\n\nIn October 2010, Choi Cheol-won, the CEO of M&M, called a tank truck driver—who had gone on a demonstration in front of the SK headquarters—to his office and assaulted them with such things as a baseball bat. As a result, the driver suffered injuries requiring two weeks of medical treatment. This incident was reported in the editorial program of MBC, which aired on 28 November 2010. Huge amounts of public criticism, particularly resulting from a memorandum that had been written to certify that the driver was given 20,000,000 won (about 20,000 dollars as of July 2018) as compensation for the violence. After Choi Cheol-won had been charged on 30 November, the police started to investigate the scandal. On 8 February 2011, the Seoul Central District Court sentenced him to 18 months in prison and the appellate tribunal sentenced him to 18 months in prison with three years of probation and 120 hours of community service. The judgement of the court's decision saying, \"Social criticism is a reason for the sentence\" caused controversy.\n\nWhen Korean Air executive ‘Cho Hyun-min’ allegedly sprayed water on company's employees, foreign media paid attention. In March 2018, the allegations of yelling and spraying water to an advertising agent caused rising controversy. When concerns over Cho's behavior became widespread, Korean Air explained, “It is true that during the meeting, the water rose and splashed when the bucket fell on the floor, but it did not spray water on the staff”. Cho apologized for her behavior. This incident caused many foreign media to start using the word \"gapjil\" directly.\n\n'Push-driven distribution gapjil' is a type of gapjil where large corporations make pressing delivery (or supply) demands to small businesses (franchises).\n\nIn May 2013, Namyang Co. was criticised following an accusation that the firm had pressed local franchises to buy products for a long time, as well as a tape-recording of rough words to local owners. Namyang Co. caused more than 20 billion wons' worth (about 18 million dollars as of July 2018) of damage through illegal activities—such as high-pressure sales and shifting wages of salesmen to local franchises—for the past seven years, for which the Seoul Central District Court convicted it in January 2014. With this case, the chronic gapjil problem in Korean society became a public social issue. There was also a boycott against Namyang Corporation.\n\nIn September 2017, Hyundai Mobis was suspected of pressure to achieve sales goals and forced sales by 1600 branches of local maintenance shops from January 2010 to November 2013. The manager of the local shops was pressed to buy unnecessary parts of an automobile under the name of \"Random Sales\" and \"Negotiated Sales\" in order to achieve the goal of the head office. Hyundai Mobis admitted carrying out these acts and since then has been establishing a plan to ensure they do not reoccur.\n\nPassion-pay is a type of labour extortion where the corporation pays less than minimum wage, or even nothing, for the labor of young job seekers who have trouble finding a job.\n\nIn January 2015, Lie Sang Bong design studio, which is managed by Korean fashion designer Lie Sang Bong, was embroiled in controversy about passion-pay. Although the studio imposed excessive workloads on workers, the studio offered relatively low wages: 100,000 won (about 100 dollars as of July 2018) for apprentices, 300,000 won (about 300 dollars) for interns and 1,100,000 won (about 1,100 dollars) for regular workers. After the controversy, Lie Sang Bong said \"I deeply apologized to the youths of the fashion industry who get hurt with working environment and treatment, and I'll try to improve the overall problem of the fashion industry in this opportunity\".\n\nIn September 2017, Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) was in a controversy because it did passion-pay on newly graduated nurses for five years since 2012, for \"probationary education period\". It turned out that SNUH only paid 360,000 won (about 360 dollars as of July 2018) for 24 days work to 1,212 nurses in their period of education. Based on an eight hour working day, the sum of 360,000 won is equivalent to an hourly rate of 1,800 won (about 2 dollars), which is far below the minimum wage of 6,470 won (about 6 dollars). The hospital explained that they did not know whether they should pay full wages during the training session. In addition, they plan to provide retroactive payment to nurses under three years, which is a period appointed by the recent labor standard law.\n\nBoycott can be defined as a movement of consumers' refusal to buy a particular item in order to accomplish a specific purpose.\n\nUnlike gapjil (which is a structural problem between 'Gap' and 'Eul', like the franchise-maker and the retailer), the boycott campaign showed that it can explode instantly when the problem touches consumer's feelings. This is because consumers think that not consuming products of gapjil firms is the best thing they can do. This movement suggests that the gapjil of company owners or executives is becoming a 'self-harm' activity which decreases corporate profits. Experts emphasize that in order to reduce corporate ethical problems, such as gapjil, consumers need to change their perception as a consumer in a larger frame of mind. Corporations will be changed when consumer involvement such as resentment at gapjil and boycott is increased. A consumer movement group staged boycott campaigns and received favourable responses from consumers, but there has not yet been a massive and organised boycott.\n\nOn 11 April 2016, the Korean civil society organisation Public Welfare Committee (PWC) opened a 24-hour call centre for reporting gapjil damages and behavior. It is operated for rooting out irregular practices. PWC explained that the purpose of the call center was to prevent gapjil behavior, which is prevalent in South Korean society, and to conduct criminal and civil measures through case verification.\n\nAfter Kim Sang-jo was inaugurated as chairperson of the Korean Fair Trade Commission (FTC), the FTC started an investigation of all industrial head offices and franchises to resolve all gapjil cases in four major areas: distribution, affiliate, subcontract, and franchise.\n\nBeginning 10 August 2017, the FTC began investigating the transactions between headquarters and agencies, which targeted about 4,800 headquarters, 70 franchises and group of franchises of all domestic industry. The investigation was conducted as a survey targeting the headquarters between August and September, and since then targeted the franchises and groups of franchises from September to December. The FTC said the purpose of the investigation was to secure basic data to prevent unfair trade practices between headquarters and franchises, in order to prepare policies and improve the system.\n\nIn July 2017, the FTC established an ombudsman for permanent surveillance of protection measures about franchises. The ombudsman was organised with former and current merchants with experience in franchise trading and 13 members of the FTC. They planned to expand the members to 30, including wholesale, retail, and service sectors. The ombudsman regularly monitors trading practices in franchise sectors and reports to the FTC when signs of unfair trade are detected. In addition, they state their opinion in policy enforcement, and they suggest ideas to improve the system by collecting problems information on the field.\n\nFor the first time in local government, the Seoul Metropolitan Government started to eradicate unfair practices in the franchise industry, declaring, \"2016 economic democratisation city, Seoul\". The Seoul Metropolitan Government has operated an unfair damage counselling centre, where anyone who suffered from unfair damages can report their case through the member's office.\n\nNot only the franchiser who is operating the franchise but also an ex-franchiser and even a group of franchisers can report and gather unfair cases of members. When the report is received, first, the government identifies the exact facts of the incident through an in-depth consultation with the franchiser who reported the incident, then meeting with a group of franchisers. According to the issue, the government recommends to the headquarters of the franchise a voluntary corrective action or handles arrangements. Depending on the degree of violation of the law, the investigation request to the FTC or the prosecution are reviewed.\n\nIn December 2014, the nut rage incident was covered by numerous international media, and gapjil reached a level of global prominence. In February 2015, the Reuters news agency reported about Korean gapjil culture and the judgement of the nut rage incident. According to the article, it seemed that Korean gapjil culture originates from a traditional vertical hierarchy in Korean society. In May 2015, \"The Independent\", British newspaper, reported on the No-Look Pass issue of Korean politician Kim Moo-sung, and pointed out that most gapjil is done by Korean adult men, especially middle aged men.\n\n"}
{"id": "29790329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29790329", "title": "Geriatric trauma", "text": "Geriatric trauma\n\nGeriatric trauma refers to a traumatic injury that occurs to an elderly person. The three prevailing causes of traumatic death in the elderly are falls (which account for 40% of traumatic death in this age group), traffic collisions and burns.\n\nA progressive decline in central nervous system function leads to a loss of proprioception, balance and overall motor coordination, as well as a reduction in eye–hand coordination, reaction time and an unsteady gait. These degenerative changes are often accompanied by osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease), which leads to a reduction in the range of motion of the head, neck and extremities. Furthermore, elderly people frequently take multiple medications for control of various diseases and conditions. The side effects of some of these medications may either predispose to injury, or may cause a minor trauma to result in a much more severe condition. For example, a person taking warfarin (Coumadin) and/or clopidogrel (Plavix) may experience a life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage after sustaining a relatively minor closed head injury, as a result of the defect in the hemostatic mechanism caused by such medications. The combined effects of these changes greatly predisposes elderly people to traumatic injury. Both the incidence of falls and the severity of associated complications increase with advancing age.\n\nVirtually all organ systems experience a progressive decline in function as a result of the aging process. One example is a decline in circulatory system function caused in part by thickening of the cardiac muscle. This can lead to congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.\n\nAtrophy of the brain begins to accelerate at around seventy years of age, which leads to a significant reduction in brain mass. Since the skull does not decrease in size with the brain, there is significant space between the two when this occurs which puts the elderly at a higher risk of a subdural hematoma after sustaining a closed head injury. The reduction of brain size can lead to issues with eyesight, cognition and hearing.\n\nElderly people are the most rapidly growing demographic in developed nations. Although they sustain traumatic injury less commonly than children and young adults, the mortality rate for trauma in the elderly is higher than in younger people. In the United States, this population accounts for 14% of all traumatic injuries, of which a majority are secondary to falls.\n\n"}

He is a two-time super featherweight world champion, having held the WBA (Super) title since April 2018 and previously the IBF title in 2017. As of July 2018, Davis is ranked as the world's second best active super featherweight by \"The Ring\" magazine, the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board, and Boxrec.\n\nDavis has been training at Upton Boxing Center since he was five years old. Davis is trained by Calvin Ford who was the inspiration for the character Dennis \"Cutty\" Wise on the hit HBO television series, \"The Wire\". Davis had a very successful amateur career, winning many national championships. He won the 2012 National Golden Gloves Championship, three straight National Silver Gloves Championships from 2006–2008, two National Junior Olympics gold medals, two National Police Athletic League Championships, and two Ringside World Championships, among others. Davis finished his illustrious amateur career with an impressive record of 206–15.\n\nDavis originally hails from the Sandtown-Winchester community in West Baltimore, which is one of the most crime-ridden areas of the city. He attended Digital Harbor High School, a local magnet school, but dropped out to focus on his career. He later earned his secondary degree through a GED program.\n\nDavis made his debut at the age of 18 on February 22, 2013 against Desi Williams, who had a professional record of no wins and 4 losses, all by stoppage. The fight took place at the D.C. Armory in Washington on the undercard of IBF super lightweight fight between Lamont Peterson and Kendall Holt. Davis won the bout via 1st round knockout. By August 2014, Davis had recorded 8 wins and no losses, with all wins coming inside the distance. Davis was taken the six round distance for the first time in October 2014 against veteran 28 year old German Meraz (47–31–1, 25 KOs).

The normally durable Mora was stopped for the first time in his career.

The fight would take place as an undercard fight to the super middleweight world title unification fight between James Degale and Badou Jack. The IBF granted Pedraza an exception to fight Davis, as he had a mandatory fight against British boxer Liam Walsh looming. prior to the fight being announced, Mayweather promotions matchmaker tried to make a deal for Davis to fight titleholder Jason Sosa. Davis defeated Pedraza in a seventh-round knockout to win the IBF junior lightweight title. After the fight, Davis said that he had studied the early career of his promoter and mentor, Floyd Mayweather Jr., in order to stay composed. He said, \"I had a lot of experience [from the amateur ranks], but I learned how to keep my composure. Floyd told me to stay calm, and I studied Floyd Mayweather [videos] when he was 'Pretty Boy.' My uppercut was my best shot, and it was landing all night. It felt really good to fight the way I did. I could take it and dish it out.\" Mayweather Jr. himself enthusiastically branded his protégé as the future of boxing. For the fight, Davis earned $75,000 compared to Pedraza, who earned the lions share of $225,000, in what was his third defence. At the time of stoppage, Davis was ahead 59–55 on all three judges scorecards. The bout took place on the undercard of the super middleweight unification fight between James DeGale and Badou Jack and averaged 344,000 viewers.\n\nOn May 7, 2017 it was announced Davis would travel to London, England for his first title defence. The news came from Frank Warren, promoter of challenger Liam Walsh (21–0, 14 KO), who was also ranked number 1 by the IBF. The fight was scheduled to take place on May 20, 2017 and billed as \"'Show me the Money\"'. At the official weigh in on May 19, Davis made weight on his third attempt. His first attempt, although he was naked, he weighed two ounces over. He was then given the two hours to attempt to lose the extra weight, although he came back earlier thinking he had lost it. He eventually met the limit of 130 pounds on his third attempt. Davis stopped Walsh in the third-round to retain his IBF title. After two cagey rounds, which were controlled by Davis, he came out with power punches at the start of the third. Walsh's legs looked to give way and David pounced with accurate hooks to the head, eventually dropping Walsh. Walsh beat the count on unsteady legs. The fight resumed and Davis went on the attack again, connected with every shot he threw, forcing referee Michael Alexander to stop the fight. The time of stoppage was 2 minutes and 11 seconds of round 3. Many at ringside believed the stoppage was premature, including Walsh, \"That was a bad stoppage. He's very fast and very active but it was too quick. He won fair and square but in England sometimes they stop the fight too early.\" Davis believed he would have caught Walsh eventually. The fight was shown live on Showtime in the USA averaging 228,000 viewers and peaking at 253,000 viewers.\n\nAccording to TMZ Sports in early July 2017, it was reported that Davis would feature in the co-main event of Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor on August 26, 2017 at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada. On July 29, The Ring Magazine reported that Davis would likely defend his IBF title against former WBO champion Román 'Rocky' Martínez, whose last fight was a knockout loss to Vasyl Lomachenko in June 2016. On August 10, Ringtv reported that Davis would instead fight unbeaten prospect Francisco Fonseca (19-0-1, 13 KOs), who at the time was ranked number 7 by the IBF. According to some sources, the potential fight with Martínez was dropped due to notice and Martínez would not have had enough time to make the 130 pound limit. Prior to the fight being announced, the IBF had ordered Fonseca to fight their number 3 ranked Billy Dib (42-4, 24 KOs) in a final eliminator, as they were the two highest ranked available. At the weigh in, Fonseca came in at the 130 pound limit. Davis showed up an hour late and came in at 132 pounds, 2 pounds over the weight limit. Davis declined to weigh in after two hours, forcing the IBF to strip him of the title. The title was declared vacant, but the title would be still up for grabs if Fonseca secured victory. In what was billed as an easy fight for Davis, he won the fight via knockout in round 8, with the ending being controversial. The final punch appeared to be an illegal punch to the back of the head to Fonseca and referee Russell Mora counted him out 39 seconds into the round. After the fight, Davis mocked Fonseca. Fonseca appeared hurt before the knockout blow, which Davis, who was being booed by the crowd, explained to Jim Gray of Showtime in the post fight interview, “I actually caught him with a body shot before that and he was hurt. So he took advantage of me hitting him in the back of his head and went down.” With the win, Davis scored his 10th straight knockout victory. Due to Davis winning the fight, the IBF title remained vacant. For the fight, Davis earned a purse of $600,000 compared to the amount $35,000 that Fonseca received.\n\nOn November 15, 2017 Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions announced that Davis would be making his in ring return in the first quarter of 2018 alongside stablemate Badou Jack. He also revealed that Davis would fight a high-level opponent. According to Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe, Davis would remain at super featherweight and likely challenge for a world title in 2018. On January 24, 2018 Showtime announced that Davis would next appear on television on the undercard of Broner vs. Vargas on April 21 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. A day later, Ellerbe stated a deal was close to being reached for Davis to fight Australian former world champion and IBF #3 Billy Dib (43-4, 24 KOs, 2 NC) in what would be an IBF eliminator. A purse bid, which was due to take place on January 25 was postponed to February 6. On February 21, it was reported by ESPN, the fight would not happen. Instead it was stated Davis's likely opponent would be former featherweight champion Jesús Cuellar (28-2, 21 KOs). On March 5, the fight was finalized for the vacant WBA 'Regular' super featherweight title. Prior to the fight, Albert Machado, the 'Super' Champion at the same weight class, was inexplicably downgraded to \"Regular' Champion, and the Davis-Cuellar fight was upgraded to be for Machado's WBA (Super) super featherweight title.\n\nIn front of 13,964 in attendance, Davis knocked out Cuellar in round 3. Davis first knocked down Cuellar in round 2 courtesy of a left hook to the body and then put him down twice in round 3 to get the stoppage. Referee Benjy Esteves Jr. stopped the action at the 2:45 mark. Davis landed 49% of his power shots in the fight. Both boxers earned $350,000 apiece. After the fight, Davis stated he wanted to unify with the winner of Tevin Farmer vs. Billy Dib, which would be contested for the IBF belt, the same belt Davis was stripped off. The bout opened Showtime’s broadcast and averaged 460,000 viewers and peaked at 527,000 viewers.\n\nOn September 19, 2017 an arrest warrant was issued for Davis, who was being accused of first-degree aggravated assault. According to Maryland court records, the alleged incident took place on August 1, 2017 but did not indicate who was involved or what happened. An amount of $100,000 unsecured bond was posted for Davis' release. Davis was due to appear in court on October 19. The charge was later changed to misdemeanor second-degree assault, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 10 years or a fine of $2,500 or both. At the court, Anthony Wheeler, a childhood friend, complained that Davis punched him on the side of the head with a 'gloved fist'. He then stated he was diagnosed with a concussion in hospital. The incident took place at the Upton Boxing Center in West Baltimore. It was said that Davis would stand trial on November 29, 2017. In court, the charges were dropped by Wheeler. The Baltimore Sun stated that Davis and Wheeler both embraced and walked out of the courtroom together.\n\nOn September 14, 2018 Davis was arrested in Washington D.C. According to a police report, he and another man started a fist fight. Punches were being landed around the upper body. It was said that some had tried to break up the fight and both men tried to flee before the police arrived. \n\n"}

He is considered one of the most famous columbia dancers and his mysterious death has been the subject of numerous essays, poems and songs, most notably \"Malanga murió\", written by Faustino Drake and performed by Arsenio Rodríguez amongst others.\n\nJosé Rosario Oviedo was born on October 5, 1885 in \"La Esperanza\", an ingenio near the village of Alacranes in the Unión de Reyes municipality, Matanzas Province, Cuba. He was baptisted on November 29 as the son of an \"unknown father\". His mother, Funciana Oviedo, was an ex-slave and raised him in the town of Unión de Reyes after living in several ingenios such as \"Majagua\" and \"San Gonzalo\". His godmother Saturnina Oviedo and his grandfather (also his godfather) José Quintero played an important role in his upbringing. Despite being christened in the Catholic faith, Malanga became a Santería practitioner; his orisha was Ochosí. He soon became a talented rumba dancer, performing with a group which featured Ángel Timbo, Ángel Calazán, Faustino Drake and Donato Torres. The percussionists played cajones, wooden boxes that preceded the conga drum.\n\nMalanga's style of dancing was unlike that of his contemporaries. He danced on his tiptoes, like ballet dancers, and often danced \"on top of a dining room table with a glass of water on his head, making all the movements of the dance or picking up a handkerchief off the floor without spilling the water\".\n\nApart from being a dancer, Malanga worked as a representative for the Partido Liberal in Unión de Reyes, and as a sugar cane cutter, especially in the 1910s and 1920s, when work opportunities decreased in the region. During the \"zafra\" season he had to migrate to the \"sugar triangle\" towns of Florida, Morón and Ciego de Ávila.\n\nIn the summer of 1927, when returning alone from Morón, Malanga died in unexplained circumstances. The most popular account of Malanga's death has been given by Crescencio Hernández \"Chencho\", according to whom Malanga was murdered with broken glass hidden in his food at a dance contest in Ceballos, near Morón. However, this \"modus operandi\" has generally been debunked. No death certificate had been found, and the location of his grave remains unknown.\n\nTogether with others such as Mulense, Chenche and Tanganica, Malanga is one of Cuba's \"legendary \"rumberos\"\", being remembered as one of the most notable rumba dancers, especially in the columbia style. As a result, his life and especially his death have been the subject of many works, from essays to poems and songs. Cuban poet Fernando García González wrote a poem in 1985 dedicated to Malanga entitled \"Canto al Rumbero Mayor\".\n\nCajón de quinto drummer Faustino Drake, one of Malanga's dearest friends, composed the song \"Malanga murió\", also known as \"A Malanga\" in 1927 as an elegy. It is one of the most popular guaguancós and its tone is remarkably solemn, as summarized by its well-known chorus: \"Unión de Reyes llora / porque Malanga murió\" (Unión de Reyes cries / because Malanga died). The song was originally sung by Roncona and later recorded by Arsenio Rodríguez as \"Llora timbero\" in 1941.\n"}

Her establishment was located on the Place Vendôme in Paris. An early collection in 1930 established Bruyère as comparable to Schiaparelli, Alix, Rochas and Mainbocher, with her coats and tailored suits proving a particular strength. Her suits were particularly noted for their subtle and unusual design elements. In August 1932 \"Fortune\" noted that her designs were rather more successful with Americans than with the French, who did not visit Bruyère's shop on the Rue de Mondovi. Bruyère's designs were imported to the United States, and in 1932, \"Fortune\" noted that a survey of copies of Paris couture gowns in the stores of Manhattan showed that Bruyère was the third most popular name, behind Vionnet and Lanvin.\n\nBruyère continued to present collections during the German occupation, now taking into account the needs of Frenchwomen who needed practical clothing that could handle the bitter winters and harsh realities of life while occupied.\n\nAfter the war ended, Bruyère was not a supporter of the full-skirted New Look as popularised by Christian Dior, instead offering extremely simple, slim-line dresses and suits with plunging necklines in 1951.\n\nIn the 1950s, Bruyère began to focus on ready-to-wear clothing. She came to an agreement in 1951 with the Baron-Peters dress firm in the United States to reproduce her designs for the American medium-priced ready-to-wear market, carefully emphasising that the designs were pure replicas of her Paris collection, and not \"whipped up for American tastes.\" In 1952 it was noted that most of Bruyère's business came from American clients.\n\nIn 1958 Bruyère was noted alongside a number of other female Parisian fashion designers, her designs described as flowing and ladylike, and worn by many famous actresses and socialites. She is thought to have ceased business during the 1950s.\n"}
{"id": "2926742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2926742", "title": "Misty of Chincoteague", "text": "Misty of Chincoteague\n\nMisty of Chincoteague is a children's novel written by Marguerite Henry, illustrated by Wesley Dennis, and published by Rand McNally in 1947. Set in the island town of Chincoteague, Virginia, the book tells the story of the Beebe family and their efforts to raise a filly born to a wild horse. It was one of the runners-up for the annual Newbery Medal, now called Newbery Honor Books. The 1961 film \"Misty\" was based on the book.\n\n\"Misty of Chincoteague\" begins with an account of the wreck of a Spanish galleon on the shores of Assateague Island off the coast of Virginia. The ponies in the hold of the galleon swim to Assateague and become feral as the years and eventually the centuries pass.\n\nThe book then tells the story of two orphan children, Paul and Maureen Beebe, who move in with their grandparents after their parents die. Paul and Maureen work to earn money to buy a Chincoteague pony mare named the Phantom, who has escaped the roundup men on Pony Penning Day for the past two years. Paul and Maureen save enough to buy Phantom, and Paul is able to capture her on the roundup because she is slowed down by her new foal, Misty. However, a man from the mainland buys the pair of ponies for his son before Paul and Maureen can give their money to the fire chief. Paul and Maureen are distressed, but they end up being able to buy Phantom and Misty because the original buyer's son won a colt in the yearly raffle and then decided he didn't need another pony, and chose the colt from the raffle.\n\nPaul and Maureen eventually break the Phantom to ride, and the next year Paul races her on Pony Penning Day. Phantom wins, but the next day becomes distressed when she sees the herd she once belonged to, led by a stallion called Pied Piper, being released to swim back to Assateague. Paul releases Phantom, and she gallops to join Pied Piper and the herd as they return to freedom on their ancestral island. Misty remains behind with Paul and Maureen.\n\n\"Misty\" was inspired by a real-life Chincoteague Pony by the same name. The real-life Misty was foaled in domesticity in 1946, on Chincoteague at the Beebe Ranch, not in the wild on Assateague Island as told in the book. As in the book, however, she was in fact sired by a chestnut pinto stallion named Pied Piper, from a smokey-black pinto dam called Phantom. Although these horses also were domesticated in real life, they too provided inspiration to Henry for the wild ponies portrayed in the novel.\n\nMisty was a chestnut and white pinto, whose coloration and markings included a large patch of white on her side shaped much like the United States. Her hoof prints are impressed in the cement of the sidewalk outside the Roxy Movie Theatre in Chincoteague.\n\nAfter being purchased by Marguerite Henry as a weanling in November 1946, and spending her early life at Henry's Wayne, Illinois home, she was later moved back to the Beebe Ranch in Chincoteague in 1957. A goodbye party with over 300 children and 160 adults in attendance was held by Henry in Wayne for Misty when she left for Chincoteague.\n\nBack in Chincoteague, Misty had three foals: \"Phantom Wings\" in 1960, \"Wisp O' Mist\" in 1961, and \"Stormy\", a chestnut pinto filly with a blaze in the shape of a crescent moon on her forehead, in 1962. As of 2015, there were almost 200 known descendants of Misty.\n\nPaul Beebe died in a car accident in 1957 at the age of 21. Clarence Beebe died two months later in 1957 after Paul's accident. Three years later Ida Beebe died in 1960. Misty died in 1972. Her body, and that of her foal Stormy who died in 1993, have been preserved through taxidermy, and can be seen at the Beebe Ranch.\n\nThe Misty of Chincoteague Foundation was formed by Marguerite Henry and Rebecca Guisti in 1990, with the two-fold mission of preserving Misty's legacy, and promoting reading by children. Funds were raised to commission a statue of Misty, sculpted by Brian Maughan, to be erected on Chincoteague, which was formally unveiled on July 29, 1997. An identical casting of the Maughan statue was also placed at Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\n\nIn the second novel, \"Sea Star\", published only two years after the original, Misty is \"sold to be shared with children the country over\" and the Beebe children rescue a \"tiny orphaned colt\" after the Pony Penning.\n\nThe third novel, \"Stormy, Misty's Foal\", was published in 1963. It tells of the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962 on Chincoteague, and the birth of Misty's last foal Stormy. Misty and Stormy had made appearances at theaters and schools in the area to help raise funds for replenishment of the herds on Assateague in the aftermath of the 1962 storm.\n\nThe fourth novel, \"Misty's Twilight\", was published after Henry's 90th birthday, and almost 30 years after the third. \"Kirkus Reviews\" observed that it was \"billed as fiction but more like a fictionalization concerning one of Misty's descendants\". It concluded its contemporary review, \"this adult-centered narrative about an affluent doctor—whose troubles with her horse are always addressed by hiring yet another trainer—may be authentic, it will be of interest mostly to those who relish every crumb about Misty's family.\"\n\nFor the 50th anniversary in 1997 of the original novel, only the month before Henry's death, Simon & Schuster released a diary garnished with quotations from \"Misty of Chincoteague\" and new illustrations by Bill Farnsworth (Little Simon, October 1997); .\n\nSeveral of the real-life Misty's descendants have been featured in books by other authors, in addition to Henry:\n\nA series of children's books by Misty family pony-breeder Kendy Allen debuted in 2006.

The case remains unsolved to this day. Many have speculated that her grandfather may have been responsible for her death, but others believe that the crime was committed by someone local to the area. Journalist James Renner has published his theory that the case may be connected to the murders of Tina Harmon, Krista Harrison, Deborah Smith and Amy Mihaljevic.\n\nBarnes was described as having been a soft-spoken girl who did well in school. She was in eighth grade and attended the nearby Harding Middle School. Because of the short distance between her home and her school, she walked to and from it every day, along with many other students. Her father had been shot to death in 1989, which had affected her to the point where her personality had changed.\n\nIt was reported by a classmate that Barnes was walking to school in her hometown of Steubenville, Ohio when she was abducted on December 7, 1995. After she failed to return home, an investigation began, including statewide searches. On February 22, 1996, her remains were discovered by surveyors in a riverbed and the cause of death was determined by examiners to have been by strangulation and she had also been raped.\n\nAlthough her body was discovered on the property of her uncle, Louis Boyce, he was not charged with her murder. Boyce has remained under suspicion due to the fact that he reportedly did not pass a polygraph test regarding the murder of Barbara. He is also believed by Barnes' family as well as members of the city to have been partially responsible for the murder of Barbara's father, although one man is currently serving life in prison for his death.\n\nA friend of Boyce expressed that it was unlikely that her grandfather had anything to do with the murder, stating that it was not likely for him to have harmed any of his grandchildren. Other leads include a Florida man convicted of abducting children who had been present in Steubenville when Barbara Barnes was abducted, although some members of the police department are skeptical, supporting the theory that she may have been murdered by someone native to the area.\n\n"}

The case is notable for the eventual admission into evidence of a letter written by the deceased prior to her death, expressing suspicion of her husband's intentions.\n\nJulie Jensen investigated her husband, checking his planner, photographing a note and documenting her suspicions. She gave the letter to a neighbor with instructions to hand it to police if anything should happen to her. She wrote that she would never commit suicide and that if she died, police should consider her husband a suspect. \"I pray that I am wrong and nothing happens, but I am suspicious of Mark's suspicious behaviors and fear for my early demise.\"\n\nIn 2008, Mark Jensen was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, a verdict which was later overturned.\n\nJulie Griffin was working at a Sears department store in Oshkosh when she met Mark Jensen in 1981. Both were students at a local college; Mark graduated but Julie did not. The couple moved to the Carol Beach neighborhood of Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin and had two children, David and Douglas, aged 8 and 3 at the time of Julie's death. Julie was described as having a complicated family life (her mother was an alcoholic and her younger brother died in an accident as a toddler), but was a devoted mother to her children. At the time of her death, Julie worked a part-time job for the Port Authority in Chicago, while Mark Jensen was employed at a construction firm.\n\nSpecial Prosecutor Robert Jambois contended that Mark Jensen poisoned his wife Julie, then 40, with ethylene glycol (antifreeze) and then suffocated her inside the garage of their home in Pleasant Prairie on December 3, 1998. The trial was moved from Kenosha County to Walworth County in response to pre-trial publicity. Defense counsel Craig Albee argued that Julie Jensen was a depressed woman who killed herself and framed her husband. Moreover, the deceased had seen a therapist at least three times for depression and was aware of her husband's extramarital affair with a co-worker, Kelly LaBonte Grieman whom Mark Jensen later married, and who assumed custody of the Jensens' two sons after Mark's eventual imprisonment. Evidence was introduced showing that Mark Jensen had discussed poisoning his wife with co-workers and a jailhouse associate, as well as searching on the internet for information relating to spousal murder and poisoning techniques. The prosecution contended further that Jensen remained angry over his wife's brief affair in 1991 with co-worker Perry Tarica. The letter's use by the prosecutors was controversial, because such evidence has been blocked from court for years by strict hearsay rules based on criminal defendants' right, under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to confront their accusers. But the Wisconsin Supreme Court, guided by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling (Crawford v Washington 541 U.S. 36 (2004)), created a hearsay exception that permitted the use of Julie Jensen's letter and statements as a dying declaration — that is, evidence of her state of mind at the time of her death.\nThe letter was the critical factor in the trial that ended on February 22, 2008. The jury found Jensen, 48, guilty of his wife's murder after more than 30 hours of deliberations. He was sentenced by Kenosha County Circuit Court Judge Bruce Schroeder on February 27, 2008 to life in prison with no chance of parole.\n\nOn December 19, 2013, a federal judge overturned Jensen's conviction, and ordered he be released from prison within 90 days. The court agreed with Jensen's argument that the state's use of his dead wife's words violated his Constitutional right to confront witnesses testifying against him. The state of Wisconsin appealed the case, but in 2015 the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the district court's decision on September 8, 2015.\n\nProsecutors decided to retry Jensen for the murder of his wife in January 2016. On September 1, 2017, Kenosha Circuit Judge Chad Kerkman reinstated Mark Jensen’s conviction.\n"}
{"id": "6077021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6077021", "title": "Orbiting Frog Otolith", "text": "Orbiting Frog Otolith\n\nThe Orbiting Frog Otolith (OFO) was a NASA space program which sent two bullfrogs into orbit on 9 November 1970 for the study of weightlessness. The name, derived through common use, was a functional description of the biological experiment carried by the satellite. \"Otolith\" referred to the frog's inner ear balance mechanism.\n\nThe Orbiting Frog Otolith Program was a part of the research program of NASA's Office of Advanced Research and Technology (OART). One of the goals of the OART was to study the vestibular system function in space and on Earth. The experiment was designed to study the adaptability of the otolith to sustained weightlessness, to provide information for crewed space flight. The otolith is a structure in the inner ear that is associated with equilibrium control: acceleration with respect to gravity as its primary sensory input.\n\nThe Frog Otolith Experiment (FOE) was developed by Torquato Gualtierotti of the University of Milan, Italy, when he was assigned to the Ames Research Center as a resident Research Associate sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences. Originally planned in 1966 to be included on an early Apollo mission, the experiment was deferred when that mission was canceled. In late 1967 authorization was given to orbit the FOE when a supporting spacecraft could be designed. The project, part of NASA's Human Factor Systems program, was officially designated \"OFO\" in 1968. After a series of delays, OFO was launched into orbit on 9 November 1970.\n\nAfter the successful OFO-A mission in 1970, interest in the research continued. A project called Vestibular Function Research was initiated in 1975 to fly a vestibular experiment in an Earth-orbiting spacecraft. This flight project was eventually discontinued, but a number of ground studies were conducted. The research has given rise to several very useful offshoots, including the ground-based Vestibular Research Facility located at ARC.\n\nOFO should not to be confused with similar acronyms describing the Orbiting Observatory series of spacecraft, such as Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (OGO), Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO), and Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO).\n\nThe OFO experiment was originally designed for flight within the Apollo Applications Program, which was established to make optimum use of hardware used in Apollo lunar missions. However, because the low acceleration levels needed for the experiment could not easily be maintained in a manned Apollo spacecraft, an unmanned satellite was later chosen as a more suitable vehicle. The satellite's design eliminated exposures to acceleration levels above 10\"g\" (10 mm/s²). This meant that the experimental specimens could experience an almost weightless state.\n\nThe spacecraft had a diameter of approximately 30 in (760 mm) and a length of 47 in (1,190 mm). The octagonal lower section of the spacecraft housed the electronic apparatus. The upper section, which contained the experiment package, was shaped like a truncated cone. A heat shield covering this upper section protected the experiment during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. A yo-yo de-spin assembly was located around the girth of the spacecraft. Four booms, folded against the side of the spacecraft, were located radially around the satellite. After the spacecraft separated from the launch vehicle, the yo-yo despin subsystem slowed spacecraft rotation. The four booms were then released to extend from the side of the spacecraft. The extension of the booms increased the moment of inertia of the spacecraft, permitting the acceleration level to remain below 10g.\n\nThe OFO-A mission was launched on November 9, 1970 (06:00 GMT) from Wallops Island launch site. The satellite carrying the OFO-A experiment remained in orbit for almost seven days. Recovery of the spacecraft was not planned. The payload was the Frog Otolith Experiment Package (FOEP).\n\nThe objective of the experiment was to investigate the effect of microgravity on the otolith, a sensory organ that responds to changes in an animal's orientation within the Earth's gravitational field.\n\nTwo American bullfrogs (\"Rana catesbeiana\") were used as experimental subjects in the flight experiment. The bullfrog was chosen for study because its inner ear labyrinth is very similar to that of humans. Since it is an amphibian, preflight surgery could be performed above water, but it could be kept in water during the flight. The water medium served to cushion the vibration and acceleration of launch, and to facilitate gas exchange with the organisms.\n\nBoth flight frogs had electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes implanted in their thoracic cavities and microelectrodes implanted in their vestibular nerves. The frogs were demotorized by cutting their limb nerves to prevent them from dislodging their implanted electrodes, and to reduce their metabolic rates. With this lowered metabolic activity, the frogs could survive in good health without being fed for as long as one month. Immersion in water allowed the frogs to breathe through their skin. The water medium also helped to move carbon dioxide and heat away from the animals.\n\nThe flight hardware unit, the FOEP, was a pressure-tight canister containing a water-filled centrifuge that housed the two frogs. The centrifuge was a cylindrical structure that rotated the frogs' heads at scheduled intervals. The FOEP also contained a life support system which could maintain a regulated environment for the frogs. This system consisted of two closed loops, one containing liquid and the other containing gas. The interface between the two loops was a selectively permeable silicone rubber that acted as an artificial lung. Oxygen passed through the membrane from the gas to the liquid side, and carbon dioxide from the liquid to the gas side. The frogs were immersed in the liquid loop. A pump circulated oxygen through the gas-containing loop. Carbon dioxide entering the gas loop was removed by an absorbent and the purified oxygen returned to the pump for recirculation. A water evaporator and an electric heater maintained the water temperature at about 60 °F (15 °C). An amplifier system in the FOEP increased voltage output from the microelectrodes implanted in the animals to the level required by the telemetry apparatus.\n\nSurgical preparation of the flight frogs was completed about 12 hours before launch, and the animals were sealed inside the FOEP. A backup FOEP was also prepared with similar specimens. The flight FOEP was installed in the satellite about three hours before launch.\n\nThe centrifuge was activated as soon as possible once the satellite was in orbit and stabilized at 10\"g\" (10 mm/s²). The centrifuge applied gravity stimuli in cycles. Each cycle lasted about 8 minutes, and consisted of the following: a 1-minute period without acceleration, an 8-second period when rotation slowly began, 14 seconds of constant 0.6 \"g\" (6 m/s²), an 8-second period when rotation slowly stopped, and a 6-minute period when aftereffects of rotation could be measured. Cycles were performed every 30 minutes during the initial 3 hours in orbit, and less frequently during the rest of the flight.\n\nThe OFO experiment continued until the seventh day in orbit, at which time the onboard battery failed. Recovery of the OFO spacecraft and FOEP hardware were not required.\n\nThe experiment was successful. Electrocardiography (ECG) indices showed the flight frogs to be in good health during the entire flight. Vestibular recordings were made as expected. Two equipment malfunctions occurred during the flight: pressure in the canister increased to , and the temperature decreased to for nine hours. However, control experiments performed on the ground showed that these malfunctions had little effect on the outcome of the flight experiment.\n\nSeveral vestibular response changes were noted during the early period in weightlessness. All of the observed changes reverted to normal during the last 10 to 20 hours of the flight, suggesting acclimatization.\n\nThe Frog Otolith Experiment Package (FOEP) contains all apparatus necessary to assure survival of two frogs. Specimens are housed in a water-filled, self-contained centrifuge which supplies the test acceleration during orbit. Frogs are demotorized to prevent dislodging of implanted electrodes and to reduce their metabolic rate.\n\nLife Support System (LSS): The LSS maintains a regulated environment within the FOEP to assure the survival and normal functioning of two demotorized frogs. The lower bulkhead of the inner assembly structure provides mounting space for all life support equipment.\n\nThe package's dimensions were 18 in (457 mm) diameter × 18 in length, weighed 91 lb (41 kg) when loaded. Data acquisition consisted of ECG, body temperature, and vestibular activity. There was also a ground-based FOEP test unit which the FOEP could be connected preflight for ventilation and verification of environmental conditions prior to loading in the spacecraft.\n\nThe outer housing of the FOEP is a pressure-tight canister 18⁄ inches (458.8 mm) in diameter and 18½ inches (470 mm) long. The bottom closure and removable top lid are both slightly domed to prevent implosion should pressure reversals be encountered. The inner assembly structure is fastened to a support ring approximately 6 inches from the bottom of the canister and consists of upper and lower bulkheads joined by a cylinder. Cutouts in the cylinder permit access to the centrifuge, which houses the frogs. Near the top of the canister are two electrical feed-through receptacles for the power supply and data line.\n\nThe centrifuge is a hollow cylinder 6 inches in diameter and 13.5 inches long with both end caps in place. The cylinder is mounted perpendicular to the canister and supported by ball bearings housed in the upper and lower bulkheads. The rotational axis of the centrifuge is formed by shafts centrally located in the vertical plane at right angles to the cylinder, held in place by the ball bearings. Thin, shallow-domed end caps are bolted to each end of the centrifuge with intervening rubber gaskets to prevent leakage. In the center of each cap is a fitting which allows frog specimens to be fully instrumented and mounted directly to the end caps before insertion into the centrifuge, and immersion. The water serves as a cushion for the high accelerations and vibrations of launch and as a medium for gas exchange via the frogs' skin. The centrifuge is locked in position and not released until after the spacecraft orbit is fully stabilized. The motor which drives the centrifuge is mounted to the upper bulkhead. Signal amplifiers and an accelerometer are mounted on the centrifuge.\n\nThe micro-electrode consists of a probe of tungsten wire 50 µm in diameter, sharpened electrically to a point less than 1 µm in diameter and completely insulated to the tip. A bubble of air trapped in the polyethylene tubing which contains the probe adds buoyancy and makes the electrode the same density as the nerve in which it is implanted, thereby allowing the two to move together. A section of paraffin is used to connect the electrode to a handle which is used only during the implantation process, then removed. Nerve impulses detected by the microelectrodes are fed into a preamplifier directly attached to the frog's jaw, and passed on to a post-data amplifier for spacecraft telemetry.\n\nThe life support system (LSS) of the Frog Otolith Experiment Package (FOEP) maintains a regulated environment within the FOEP to assure the survival and normal functioning of the experimental specimens. The LSS is designed to meet the physiological requirements of two demotorized frogs weighing 350 g (12 oz) each. Frogs are demotorized by cutting the limb nerves, which reduces their metabolic rate. In this condition, the frogs require no artificial respiration and can remain healthy without being fed, for as long as a month. After being installed in the centrifuge the frogs are completely immersed in water, which serves as the medium for exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide and heat through the frog's skin.\n\nThe LSS primarily consists of two closed loops: one containing liquid and the other containing gas. The lower bulkhead of the inner assembly structure provides mounting space for all LSS equipment. The oxygen supply system operates through these loops and includes a 4.5 cm³ capacity oxygen bottle, a pressure reducer and regulator, an artificial lung, CO absorber, and water supply. Limited control over the temperature of the frogs' environment is available by means of a water evaporator/heater.\n\nThe interface between loops occurs at a selectively permeable membrane of silicon rubber which separates the liquid and gas. This membrane, called the lung, passes oxygen from the gas loop to the liquid loop, and CO from the liquid loop to the gas loop.\n\nThe frogs, housed in the centrifuge, are in the liquid loop. Moving from the lung to the frogs, the loop contains water and dissolved oxygen; moving from the frogs back to the lung, it contains water and free CO. A double layer of polyurethane foam lining the interior of the centrifuge prevents frog waste matter from fouling the water circulation system. Water is circulated through the liquid loop using a small pump and must pass through the filter before leaving the centrifuge.\n\nThe gas loop consists of a circuit in the lower bulkhead through which oxygen is circulated by a small pump. The pump delivers pure oxygen to the lung where some of it passes into the liquid loop, while the remainder becomes mixed with the CO coming from the liquid loop. From the lung, the oxygen-CO mixture is passed through a bed of Baralyme which absorbs the CO. Pure oxygen is returned from the Baralyme to the pump and recirculated. The oxygen supply is replenished by gas from the small oxygen tank.\n\nAugmented by the thermal environment of the spacecraft, the water evaporator and 8 Watt electric heater will maintain water temperature at 60±5 °F (15.5±3 °C). The water supply for the evaporator is contained in a rubber bladder supported by a ring in the canister immediately above the lower dome. When water temperature exceeds the nominal 60 °F, a ground command actuates a timing circuit operating a valve. As a result of the ambient pressure inside the canister, water is forced from the bladder through the valve and into the evaporator. Internal heat loads are transferred through a heat exchanger to the evaporator and are dissipated in evaporating the water.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38058488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38058488", "title": "Orderud case", "text": "Orderud case\n\nThe Orderud case () was a notorious case of triple murder that occurred in Norway on 22 May 1999. The victims were 47-year-old Anne Orderud Paust, her mother 84-year-old Marie Orderud and her father 81-year-old Kristian Orderud who were found shot and killed at their country estate in Sørum, Akershus.\n\nEventually Anne's brother Per Kristian Orderud, his wife Veronica Orderud, Veronica's sister Kristin Kirkemo and Kristin's ex-boyfriend Lars Grønnerød were arrested and were convicted of complicity to premeditated murder in 2001. The mysterious triple murder case is the criminal case that has probably generated the most media attention in Norwegian history. Despite four people being convicted, the actual killer has never been caught.\n\nOn 17 July 1998, while heading to work at the Ministry of Defence, the Norwegian defense minister's personal secretary, Anne Orderud Paust discovered a charge of explosives under her truck. The 500g explosive device was of the type Solex. The incident was given \"extremely high priority\" with the Oslo police. On 12. August her husband Per Paust, a high level Ministry of Foreign Affairs official, stated that there had been an attempt to ignite a propane gas tank at the stairwell of their apartment in Skillebekk, Oslo. He discovered the 5-kilo tank with an open vent, outside his door which was doused in gasoline. Officials from the fire department claimed that the whole building could easily have been \"blown apart\". These two assassination attempts received wide publicity and caused a media sensation. In the end no one was charged or arrested in connection with either of the two incidents.\n\nThe couple then spent a few months in New York City where Per worked as a temporary Consul-General, returning to Norway in January 1999. Around 15 May, an anonymous person called and warned the authorities that Anne Paust and her parents would be murdered. Despite extensive searches, the caller was never found, and one week later the same people were found dead.\n\nOn the night of 22 May, Anne Orderud Paust and her parents, Marie (b. 1915) and Kristian Orderud (b. 1918), were shot and killed in the parents' home, on the Olerud Estate in Sørum, Akershus. Hiding in the adjacent woods until the cover of nightfall, the assailant entered the house sometime between midnight and 5am by climbing on to the second floor porch and breaking the window on the veranda door.\n\nProbably awoken by the noise, 84-year old Marie Orderud confronted the intruder as he was entering the house and was shot at close range and killed instantly. Meanwhile, their daughter 47-year old Anne, also entered the room and was likewise shot and killed in the same manner, both women were found in their nightgowns. The assailant then went to the couples bedroom where 80-year-old Kristian Orderud was lying. He was impaired by his old age and was unable to escape or otherwise offer any resistance to the gunman. He was executed from point-blank range. The gunman then proceeded to escape through the same back-door from which he had entered, the only visible trace being the broken door-window.\n\nThe next morning, Kristian's brother Hans came to visit, and upon seeing the broken door went in for a closer look. He then discovered the bodies of his family members and contacted the police. \nThe killings happened just weeks after Anne Orderud Paust had voluntarily declined to be assigned close protection officers from the Police Security Service.\n\nEarly in the investigation, the police felt confident that the assailant or assailants were familiar with the victims and that the victims probably knew their killer. The investigators theorized that the time of the killings had not been coincidental. Based on the fact that only a handful of people knew that Anne would be visiting on that precise time, the investigators concluded that the killer had the house under careful surveillance, and acting when seeing her car parked outside. The main theory is that Anne Orderud Paust was the main target of the killer or killers.\n\n\nThe police further speculated that the victims did not initially realize the danger they were facing, the location of the bodies in the estate's second floor indicated that they did not consider escaping when they faced their intruder, and in spite of the unexpected and dramatic break-in nobody made any effort to alert the police or others. One explanation may be that the victims initially did not feel the intruder to be threatening or did not see it necessary to contact the police. The fact that Kristian Orderud was killed while lying in his bed, indicated that the perpetrator was not a random predator without intimate knowledge of the family, but rather knew exactly who his victims were. This was backed up by the fact that nothing was missing from the house, ruling out a robbery.\n\nIn June, four people were charged with premeditated murder or complicity in to premeditated murder: Anne Orderud Paust's brother Per Kristian Orderud (b. 1954), his wife Veronica Orderud (b. 1972), Veronica Orderud's half sister Kristin Kirkemo (later Kristin Kirkemo Haukeland (b. 1973)) and her former partner Lars Grønnerød (b. 1958). The motive for the killings were according to the prosecution a conflict of ownership of the Orderud estate and farm. Marie and Kristian Orderud were registered as the owners of the farm even though their son for years had operated it and wanted to take it over. Prosecutors believed that all four were involved in the murder, but neither the investigation nor the subsequent trials gave answers to who actually carried out the brutal killings.\n\nOn 22 June 2001, both Per and Veronica Orderud, along with Kristin Kirkemo was found guilty on all charges and each received sentences of 21 years in prison. Lars Grønnerød was found guilty of illegal weapons charges and sentenced to two and a half years in prison.\n\nThe murder of Anne Orderud Paust and her parents received media attention like that of no other criminal case in the country's history, with almost daily coverage in the month after the killings, and very intimate account of the accused individuals under the full name. The media coverage led to debate about the media's handling of the case and the police and the defenders' leaks to the media.\n\nAccording to NRK \"Brennpunkt\", reliable sources independently tie both Per Paust and Anne Orderud Paust to Norwegian intelligence services. Per Paust's death fourteen days before the Orderud murders, reportedly from cancer after short-term sickness, has been suspected by people close to him to in reality have been caused by poisoning. Per Paust had worked in Serbia during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, describing it in private as his most difficult task ever, with balancing acts between the two sides in the conflict and involved in work attempting to stop illegal weapons smuggling. Anne Orderud Paust in turn worked with managing threats against the Foreign Ministry.\n\nKristin Kirkemo, who was convicted for co-conspiracy to the murders, had in turn established close ties to Yugoslavian mafia in Oslo. The godparents to her son are considered by police to be part of Yugoslavian mafia involved in weapons trade, drug trade, and illegal gambling. Income from the mafia reportedly financed Kosovo Albanian guerilla activity. In early 1999 Norwegian police took part in a European-wide crackdown on Kosovo Albanian mafia, including Princ Dobroshi which has been proposed as background for the murders, although no direct link has been uncovered. Although overturned in the Eidsivating Court of Appeal, the Nes District Court initially deemed it proven that Kristin Kirkemo placed dynamite under Anne Paus Orderud's car in the 1998 assassination attempt.\n\nA cousin to Per Orderud claims to have been in contact with criminal sources in Oslo, which alleges that two Yugoslavians from Sweden committed the murders in an ordered hit. Private investigator Tore Sandberg in 2009 produced the name of a suspected killer from Balkan who allegedly committed the murders along with two others.\n\n"}

Bellas and R.J. Duro in the Integrated Group for Engineering Research (GII) at the University of Coruña, in Spain. It evolves variable size feedforward artificial neural networks (ANN) that are encoded into sequences of genes for constructing a basic ANN unit. Each of these blocks is preceded by a gene promoter acting as an on/off switch that determines if that particular unit will be expressed or not.\n\nThe basic unit in the PBGA is a neuron with all of its inbound connections as represented in the following figure:\n\nThe genotype of a basic unit is a set of real valued weights followed by the parameters of the neuron and proceeded by an integer valued field that determines the promoter gene value and, consequently, the expression of the unit. By concatenating units of this type we can construct the whole network.\n\nWith this encoding it is imposed that the information that is not expressed is still carried by the genotype in evolution but it is shielded from direct selective pressure, maintaining this way the diversity in the population, which has been a design premise for this algorithm. Therefore, a clear difference is established between the search space and the solution space, permitting information learned and encoded into the genotypic representation to be preserved by disabling promoter genes.\n\nThe PBGA was originally presented within the field of autonomous robotics, in particular in the real time learning of environment models of the robot.\n\nIt has been used inside the Multilevel Darwinist Brain (MDB) cognitive mechanism developed in the GII for real robots on-line learning. In another paper it is shown how the application of the PBGA together with an external memory that stores the successful obtained world models, is an optimal strategy for adaptation in dynamic environments. \n\nRecently, the PBGA has provided results that outperform other neuroevolutionary algorithms in non-stationary problems, where the fitness function varies in time.\n\n"}

It applies data consistency objectives to continuous data protection services. Following the definitions for RPO and RTO, RCO defines a measurement for the consistency of distributed business data within interlinked systems after a disaster incident. Similar terms used in this context are \"Recovery Consistency Characteristics\" (RCC) and \"recovery object granularity\" (ROG). \nThe term RCO focuses on business data consistency across multiple systems in SOA-driven business applications such as SAP ERP. It can be defined per business processes and reflects the individual requirements of corresponding business data and cross-system consistency. While RTO and RPO are absolute per-system values, RCO is expressed as percentage measuring the deviation between actual and targeted state of business data across systems for individual business processes or process groups.\n\nThe following formula calculates RCO with \"n\" representing the number of business processes and \"entities\" representing an abstract value for business data:\nformula_1\nTargeting 100% RCO for a business process (distributed across several systems) would mean that no business data deviation is allowed after a disaster incident whereas any target below 100% allows deviation. Target values for RCO increase with the criticality of the underlying business data: logistics and banking-related business processes are often characterized by higher RCO requirements than those of CRM or HR systems. \n\nIncluding RCO considerations in addition to RTO and RPO in the business impact analysis helps to focus on the integrity of business data and processes in complex application environments. RCO considerations should be included in the Disaster Recovery Architecture by manually defining multiple consistency points across the landscape or by special Disaster Recovery mirroring tools.\n"}
{"id": "929016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=929016", "title": "Skinning", "text": "Skinning\n\nSkinning is the act of skin removal. The process is done with animals, mainly as a means to prepare the muscle tissues beneath for consumption or for use of the fur or tanning of the skin. The skin may also be used as a trophy, sold on the fur market, or, in the case of a declared pest, used as proof of kill to obtain a bounty from a government health, agricultural, or game agency.\n\nTwo common methods of skinning are open skinning and case skinning. Typically, large animals are open skinned and smaller animals are case skinned.\n\nSkinning, when it is performed on live humans as a form of capital punishment or murder, is referred to as \"flaying\".\n\n\"Case skinning\" is a method where the skin is peeled from the animal like a sock. This method is usually used if the animal is going to be stretched out or put in dry storage. Many smaller animals are case skinned, leaving the skin mostly undamaged in the shape of a tube.\n\nAlthough the methods of case skinning individual animals vary slightly, the general steps remain the same. To case skin an animal, it is hung upside down by its feet. A cut is made in one foot, and continued up the leg, around the anus and down the other leg. From there the skin is pulled down the animal as though removing a sweater.\n\n\"Open skinning\" is a method where the skin is removed from the animal like a jacket. This method is generally used if the skin is going to be tanned immediately or frozen for storage. A skin removed by the open method can be used for wall hangings or rugs. Larger animals are often skinned using the open method.\n\nTo open skin an animal, the body is placed on a flat surface. A cut is made from the anus to the lower lip, and up the legs of the animal. The skin is then opened and removed from the animal.\n\nThe final step is to scrape the excess fat and flesh from the inside of the skin with a blunt stone or bone tool.\n\n\"Dorsal skinning\" is very similar to open skinning, however instead of making a cut up the stomach of the animal, the cut is made along the spine. This method of skinning is very popular among taxidermists, as the backbone is easier to access and cleaner than the stomach and between the legs.\nA dorsal incision is made by laying the animal on its abdomen and making a single cut from the base of the tail to the shoulder region. The animal’s skin is easier to remove if the animal has been freshly killed.\n\n\"Cape skinning\" is the process of removing the shoulder, neck and head skin for the purpose of displaying the animal as a trophy.\n\nNative Americans used skins for many purposes other than decoration, clothing and blankets. Animal skin was a staple in the Native Americans' daily lives. It was used to make tents, to build boats, to make bags, to create musical instruments such as drums, and to make quivers.\n\nSince Native Americans were practiced in the means of acquiring and manipulating animal skin, fur trading developed from contact between them and Europeans in the 16th century. Animal skin was a valuable currency which the Native Americans had in excess and would trade for things such as iron-based tools and tobacco which were common in the more developed European areas. Beaver hats became very popular towards the end of the 16th century, and skinning beavers was necessary to acquire their wool. In this time, the beaver skin drastically rose in demand and in value. However, the high number of beavers being harvested for their pelts led to a depletion of beavers, and the industry had to slow down.\n\nTo raise animals for the purpose of collecting their skin is called \"fur farming\". People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) alleges that fur farmers are involved in skinning live animals. Killing tactics deemed brutal by PETA are also a concern. Many fur farms allegedly skin animals alive to keep the pelts intact from damage that could occur while killing them. To avoid bullet holes, tears or slits from a knife, fur farmers use methods such as beating the animal, electrocuting them, using poison to paralyse them, or breaking their necks. Although these methods ensure an undamaged pelt, they are sometimes not enough to confirm the death of the animal, leaving the creature to be skinned alive.\n\nThe fur trade, however, insists that the only evidence of a fur animal ever being skinned alive was almost certainly staged by animal rights activists. This was a video taken in a Chinese market of a raccoon dog being skinned alive, released in 2005 by Swiss Animal Protection. \n\nThe fur trade furthermore insists that, for several reasons, animals are never skinned alive. Aside from the inhumanity and illegality of such an act, it says that skinning an animal that was still alive would expose the operator to the risk of infection from the animal's claws and teeth, as well as to the risk of being cut with their own knife; would take longer than skinning a dead animal; and would result in a spoiled fur because the animal's beating heart would cover it in blood.\n\nAmong many campaigns, one of PETA’s goals is to enforce animal rights so that animals will not be used in any way as tools for humans; including as family pets. This includes utilizing their skin for clothing or decoration, and especially hurting the animals in any way. Therefore, regardless of the method used for animal skinning, PETA is against the industry in general.\n\n\n"}

The perpetrator, student Eric Hainstock, entered the school's main hallway with a revolver and fatally shot principal John Klang. He is serving a life sentence and will be eligible for parole in 2037.\n\nOn 29 September 2006, Eric Hainstock, a 15 year old freshman at Weston High School, entered the main hallway of the school with a .22 caliber revolver and a 20-gauge shotgun taken from his father's locked gun cabinet. After arriving at school around 8:00 a.m., he aimed the shotgun at a social studies teacher. The school custodian, Dave Thompson, wrestled the shotgun away from Hainstock. Principal John Alfred Klang then entered the hallway and confronted Hainstock, who was still armed with the handgun. Hainstock grabbed the revolver from inside his jacket and fired several shots. Klang then grabbed Hainstock, wrestled him to the ground and swept away the gun. Klang was on top of Hainstock, a pool of blood by Klang's leg. Staff and students apprehended Hainstock, holding him until the police arrived.\n\nKlang was treated at Reedsburg Area Medical Center where he underwent surgery, and was then flown to the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison, where he died shortly after 3 p.m. Klang was the only one shot in the shooting. For his actions in wrestling away the gun and subduing Hainstock, Klang was posthumously awarded the Carnegie Medal by the Carnegie Hero Fund.\n\nThe high school students were initially taken to the elementary school gym, where they had the option to talk to a crisis counselor or go home. The elementary students were taken home by bus or by their parents. The homecoming events were canceled.\n\nThe perpetrator of the shooting was 15-year-old Eric Hainstock, a freshman at Weston High School. Hainstock lived with his father and stepmother in a two-story A-Frame farm house about four miles northwest of Cazenovia in La Valle located on a hill surrounded by farm land. Eric Hainstock was born on April 4, 1991 in La Crosse, Wisconsin to Shawn Hainstock and Lisa Marie Buttke. His parents divorced when he was two years old, and in December 1995 went to court to seek custody of Eric. When Hainstock was nine, his mother's parental rights were terminated by court-order after she failed to pay child support.\n\nHis father remarried and Eric was adopted by his stepmother. Hainstock's father was unemployed and received disability pensions. In September 2001, the Sauk County Department of Children and Families were called to the residence after he had allegedly kicked his son. By court-order, Eric was forced to live with his paternal grandmother, before he returned to his father's care in April 2002. In a letter he submitted to Madison based newspaper \"Isthmus\", Eric claimed he was treated like a slave by his father, having to do all of the cleaning, even having to clean past midnight. He claimed to have been severely disciplined by his father. He claimed that his father would make him stand in his bedroom corner with his nose touching a wall and holding one of his legs in the air for long periods.\n\nAt Weston High School, Eric claimed that about 25 to 30 students bullied him. When he complained to the faculty at the school, Eric claims that nothing was done to prevent the bullying. In early 2006, Hainstock had started his fifth year at Weston High School where he had transferred in 6th grade, after having behavior problems and relatively poor test scores at his previous school. On one occasion shortly before the shooting, Eric and his stepmother were involved in a physical confrontation and Eric was left with human bite marks on him. After Eric shot John Klang, he told police that he had not meant to hurt him; his goal was to confront him and \"make him listen\" about the bullying. He reported that he was only allowed to shower once a week, which left him with poor hygiene. The clothes and shoes that his father bought for him were in poor condition and were not the right size.\n\nIt later transpired that as a student, Eric had been under medication and using prescription drugs in a bid to treat ADHD. Dr. Peter Breggin, a doctor and an expert on the US drug industry has theorized that there is a possibility that these prescription drugs could have caused imbalances in Eric, leading to him carrying out the shooting.\n\nWhile in prison, Michael Caldwell from Middleton, Wisconsin diagnosed Eric with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\nHainstock was charged with first-degree murder by the Sauk County District Attorney's office, and was found guilty on August 2, 2007. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and will be eligible for parole in 2037 when he is 46 years old.\n\nHainstock is currently serving his sentence at the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility in Boscobel, Wisconsin after previously being incarcerated at the Green Bay Correctional Institution in Green Bay, Wisconsin. While in prison, he has allowed \"Isthmus\" to share his story. He has written a ten-page letter with the help of his cell-mate. According to Hainstock, he has gained 50 pounds, his reading went from a fourth grade level to a tenth grade level, and he is working on his GED. Hainstock's father and stepmother Priscilla visit him about every month. In his letter, Hainstock takes responsibility for what he did, but he believes that he is not to blame for everything. In October 2008, Hainstock's supportive cellmate at Green Bay was reassigned without any official explanation.\n\n"}
