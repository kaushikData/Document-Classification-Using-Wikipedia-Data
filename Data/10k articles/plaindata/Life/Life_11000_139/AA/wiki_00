He signed with Universal in 2007 and his collaboration with T-Pain on the song \"She Got It\", which peaked at #7 on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart in 2008, and hit #2 on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart.\n\nFrom a broken home, Saunders grew up being looked after by his extended family. By his teens, he became involved in local crime and in 2005 was incarcerated for eight months. After this he became involved in music promotion and formed a group called Blood Money Union, which consisted of other DJs, producers and rappers.\n\nSaunders' first success in rapping had come with a self-released record called \"Dirty Foot,\" which he wrote while still in high school and distributed in the Tarpon Springs area, at the urging of his cousin. After hearing it played in a local dance club and then witnessing another rapper's performance, 2 Pistols had his first chance to perform on-stage. After taking the stage and performing his own single (\"Dirty Foot\"), 2 Pistols' confidence in his abilities grew to a point that he began to take his chances at making a career of music seriously.\n\nHis debut album, \"Death Before Dishonor\", was released on June 17, 2008 and featured production from the Grammy-winning J.U.S.T.I.C.E.

As a teenager, he became the drummer (and later the bass guitar player) of the band initially formed by his brothers Bill and Bob Cowsill, playing popular tunes at local dance clubs. By the late 1960s, the band expanded to include younger brother John (on drums), his mother Barbara, older brother Paul, and younger sister Susan. The Cowsills went on to churn out a string of hits (including the #2's \"The Rain the Park and Other Things\" and \"Hair\") before officially disbanding by 1972.\n\nAfter the group broke up, Cowsill moved frequently and worked various jobs including construction and waiting tables. For a time, Cowsill owned a bar in Austin which he admitted he lost because he \"drank it dry. I was drinking my face off in those days.\" Throughout his life, he continued to play music and participated in various post-heyday incarnations of the Cowsills. In 1998, he released his first solo CD, \"As Is\". In 2002, he relocated to his hometown of Newport, Rhode Island. In 2005, Cowsill relocated again to New Orleans. Shortly before his death, he had made plans to enter a Los Angeles rehab facility to seek help for his alcoholism. His flight to Los Angeles had been scheduled for August 28, but those plans were stymied when Hurricane Katrina hit the city on August 29.\n\nIn 1987, Cowsill married a woman named Deborah with whom he had two children (he also had an older daughter). Cowsill and his wife were divorced in 2003.\n\nOn August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the city of New Orleans. Cowsill, who chose not to evacuate, weathered the storm in an abandoned warehouse. Cowsill survived the storm but was in need of help. He called his sister Susan from a pay phone (Susan also lived in New Orleans with her family but chose to evacuate) and left four voice mail messages saying he was surrounded by looters and people shooting. Susan Cowsill did not receive the messages until September 2. Cowsill was never heard from again. After an extensive search, Cowsill's body was found under a wharf on the Mississippi River on December 28, 2005. His body was subsequently identified by comparison to dental records. Cowsill's death was attributed to drowning as a result of the flooding following Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe Cowsill family held two memorials for Barry in Newport and New Orleans.\n\n\n"}

A worker can explode suicidally and aggressively as an ultimate act of defense, an ability it has in common with several other species in this genus and a few other insects. The ant has an enormously enlarged mandibular (jaw) gland, many times the size of a normal ant, which produces defense adhesive secretions.\n\nIts defensive behaviours include self-destruction by autothysis, a term coined by Maschwitz and Maschwitz (1974). Two oversized, poison-filled mandibular glands run the entire length of the ant's body. When combat takes a turn for the worse, the worker ant violently contracts its abdominal muscles to rupture its gaster at the intersegmental fold, which also bursts the mandibular glands, thereby spraying a sticky secretion in all directions from the anterior region of its head. The glue, which also has corrosive properties and functions as a chemical irritant, can entangle and immobilize all nearby victims.\n\nDirect observation by Jones (2004) found that \"C. saundersi\" adhesive secretions range from bright white at the end of the wet season to cream or pale yellow in the dry season and start of the wet season. These variations in coloration represent a shift in internal pH, likely due to seasonal changes in diet.\n\nAutothysis in \"C. saundersi\" is common during territorial battles with other ant species or groups. Territorial weaver ants (\"Oecophylla smaragdina\") are known to stalk and attack \"C. saundersi\" for territory as well as for predation. Self-sacrifice of \"C. saundersi\" workers is likely to help the colony as a whole by ensuring that the colony retains its foraging territory. Therefore, such behavior would continue within a population given that the behavior was already genetically present within the majority of workers.\n\n\"C. saundersi\" uses autothysis to defend against predation by other arboreal arthropods (weaver ants, spiders), which are believed to be the main predatory threat to \"C. saundersi\" for two reasons:\n\"C. saundersi\" also uses autothysis to defend against vertebrate predators because the chemicals involved are inedible, which could deter certain predators from engaging this species of ant in the future.\n\nThe \"toxic glue\" of \"C. saundersi\" is predominately composed of polyacetates, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and alcohols. Branched-skeleton lactones and methylated isocoumarins produced in the hindgut function as trail pheromones, while straight-chain hydrocarbons and esters produced in the Dufour‘s glands act as alarm pheromones in \"C. saundersi\" and related species.\nJones, et al. (2004) identified the following chemicals within the secretion:\n\nPhenols\nAliphatics\nTerpenoids\n\nBoth 2,4-Dihydroxyacetophenone and 2-Methyl-5,7-dihydroxychromone are phenolic ketones which cause the pH-dependent color changes of the secretion.\n\n(6R)-(E)-2,6-Dimethyl-2-octen-1,8-dionic acid is an acyclic monoterpene previously undocumented in insects. However, the chemical is well known to be a urinary metabolite in mammals, with overproduction resulting in toxic acidosis in various species.\n\n\n"}

Due to the recent explosion of epigenome datasets, computational methods play an increasing role in all areas of epigenetic research.\n\nResearch in computational epigenetics comprises the development and application of bioinformatics methods for solving epigenetic questions, as well as computational data analysis and theoretical modeling in the context of epigenetics. This includes modelling of the effects of histone and DNA CpG island methylation.\n\nVarious experimental techniques have been developed for genome-wide mapping of epigenetic information, the most widely used being ChIP-on-chip, ChIP-seq and bisulfite sequencing. All of these methods generate large amounts of data and require efficient ways of data processing and quality control by bioinformatic methods.\n\nA substantial amount of bioinformatic research has been devoted to the prediction of epigenetic information from characteristics of the genome sequence. Such predictions serve a dual purpose. First, accurate epigenome predictions can substitute for experimental data, to some degree, which is particularly relevant for newly discovered epigenetic mechanisms and for species other than human and mouse. Second, prediction algorithms build statistical models of epigenetic information from training data and can therefore act as a first step toward quantitative modeling of an epigenetic mechanism. Successful computational prediction of DNA and lysine methylation and acetylation has been achieved by combinations of various features.\nThe important role of epigenetic defects for cancer opens up new opportunities for improved diagnosis and therapy. These active areas of research give rise to two questions that are particularly amenable to bioinformatic analysis. First, given a list of genomic regions exhibiting epigenetic differences between tumor cells and controls (or between different disease subtypes), can we detect common patterns or find evidence of a functional relationship of these regions to cancer? Second, can we use bioinformatic methods in order to improve diagnosis and therapy by detecting and classifying important disease subtypes?\n\nThe first wave of research in the field of computational epigenetics was driven by rapid progress of experimental methods for data generation, which required adequate computational methods for data processing and quality control, prompted epigenome prediction studies as a means of understanding the genomic distribution of epigenetic information, and provided the foundation for initial projects on cancer epigenetics. While these topics will continue to be major areas of research and the mere quantity of epigenetic data arising from epigenome projects poses a significant bioinformatic challenge, several additional topics are currently emerging.\n\n\n"}

Martinus Beijerinck (1851-1931), a Dutch microbiologist and botanist, first used the term when studying the tobacco mosaic virus, becoming convinced that the virus had a liquid nature. \n\nIn 1892 Dmitri Ivanovsky had discovered that the cause of tobacco mosaic disease could pass through Chamberland's porcelain filter. He noted these findings but felt that they could only have resulted from a cracked filter. It was left to Beijerinck in 1898 to put forward the idea that the pathogen was small enough to pass through the filter routinely used to trap bacteria. \n\nIvanovsky, irked that Beijerinck had not cited him, recreated Beijerinck's experimental set-up and demonstrated that particles of ink were small enough to pass through the filter, thus leaving the particulate or fluid nature of the pathogen unresolved. The invention of the electron microscope in 1931 led to the first virus images in 1935 by the American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley.

{"id": "55838656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55838656", "title": "Culture of violence theory", "text": "Culture of violence theory\n\nThe culture of violence theory addresses the pervasiveness of specific violent patterns within in a societal dimension. The concept of violence being ingrained in Western society and culture has been around for at least the past century. Developed from structural violence, as research progressed the notion that a culture can sanction violent acts developed into what we know as culture of violence theory today. Two prominent examples of culture legitimizing violence can be seen in rape myths and victim blaming. Rape myths lead to misconstrued notions of blame; it is common for the responsibility associated with the rape to be placed on the victim rather than the offender.\n\nFurthermore, the culture of violence theory potentially accounts for inter-generational theories of violence and domestic violence. Childhood exposure to violence in the household may later lead to similar patterns in marital relations. Similarly, early experience with domestic violence is likely to increase an individual's potential for development of clinical symptoms. Additionally, presence of a preexisting mental disorder may heighten the chances of becoming involved in an abusive relationship.\n\nThere are many factors which contribute to the persistence of violence among individuals and on a societal level; gender is one relevant factor to understanding the culture of violence theory. In the United States, a majority of reported rapes involve female victims. However, there is a growing body of evidence to support the notion that women can perpetuate relational cycles of violence. While a culture of violence has an impact on people as a whole, for individuals who have experienced trauma in their lives the impact can be much larger.\n\nAs mentioned previously the culture of violence theory addresses the pervasiveness of specific violent patterns within in a societal dimension. Specifically, culture of violence theory explains how cultures and societies can sanction violent acts. While related to structural violence, cultural violence theory is different by explaining why direct acts of violence or violence built into systems of society exists and how they are legitimized. Research suggests that cultures can encourage and permit violence to exist as a response to various environmental obstacles, such as widespread resource impoverishment. This can be seen within various aspects of culture, such as film, television, music, language, art, and propaganda.\n\nRape myths refer to the inaccurate views and stereotypes of forced sexual acts, and the victims and perpetuators of them. These notions are prevalent among the general population and often suggest that the victims of non-consensual sexual acts have bad reputations, are promiscuous, dress provocatively, or are fabricating assault when they regret the consensual acts after the fact. These views are often legitimized by the status quo of men dominating women across domains such as family, education, work, and many others. Rape myth acceptance can lead to poor assault/rape prevention measures, decrease in reporting of assaults/rapes, increases of assaults/rapes, and re-victimization.\n\nViolence in relationships, commonly referred to as intimate partner violence (IPV), is impacted by various factors including the presence of mental illness or use of substances. Specifically, individuals with depression, generalized anxiety (GAD), or panic disorder are potentially at risk for physical violence towards a partner; findings are consistent for both men and women regarding the connection between psychiatric diagnoses and perpetuation of relationship violence. Additionally, propensity to engage in specific behaviors such as gambling or endorsement of violent pornography have also been associated with increased risk for relationship violence occurrence. Individual factors have also been suggested to be associated with relationship violence including anger, aggressiveness, and adverse emotional internalization. Contrarily, exposure to relationship violence is also linked to the later development of mental health symptoms or diagnoses.\n\nThe prevalence of legitimization of violence may be facilitated by its presence in various media. There is evidence to suggest that sex-related crimes account for nearly 10% of all dialogue on television related to sex, most of which is found on fictional programs. Additionally, research has also found a positive relationship between pornography consumption and attitudes supporting violence against women, especially when the pornography in question is violent in nature. However, consideration of individual differences is necessary in evaluating exposure to violent media and overall outcomes. Factors which influence media content exposure and subsequent outcomes include gender and personality traits. Individuals who are male, hostile, impulsive, and are low on empathy are more likely to be susceptible to violent media exposure.\n\nPublic justification of violence arise when those not necessarily directly involved in the violent act will not react negatively to the violence because they believe it is warranted. Examples of public justification of violence are most evident in rape myths and victim blaming, as discussed above. However, the common belief regarding legitimate violence tends to place responsibility on victims or potential victims of violence. Another example that is not as often noted, is the pervasive notion of the \"chosen one,\" within some extremist religious language and various nationalism propaganda that will function as a means to perpetuate the undermining of the other and allowance of violence against the other.\n\nEarly childhood trauma, specifically exposure to abuse or violence, is linked to mental health disorder development. Witnessing domestic violence during childhood places individuals at a greater risk for developing psychological disorders such as depression. General functioning may be impacted in behavioral or emotional domains as a result of exposure to domestic violence as a child. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a widely supported potential resultant diagnosis of childhood trauma. More specifically, interpersonal trauma places children and adolescents at an increased risk for developing PTSD, with girls being the most susceptible. Furthermore, exposure to bullying has also been shown to induce symptoms of PTSD or be connected to a PTSD diagnosis. Bullying and trauma responses have been observed in both child and adult populations as well as across various environments including academic or professional settings.\n\nFor individuals who have experienced rape or sexual violence, interventions are implemented to address symptoms of trauma. Various types of therapeutic interventions, including cognitive-processing therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, and eye movement desensitization, have been utilized for trauma responses.\n"}

He graduated from the University of Florida in 1917, and later that same year was admitted to the Florida Bar. After graduating, he served at the naval base in Key West, Florida, then attended the United States Naval Academy, where he received a commission to serve on the gunboat Annapolis. During World War I he served as an ensign aboard the USS Minneapolis (C-13).\n\nAfter the war, he returned to West Palm Beach to practice law with his father. He married Marjorie M. McKinley, a Cornell University student and daughter of old friends of the Chillingworth family.\n\nHe remained in the U.S. Naval Reserves and was recalled to active duty in 1942. During World War II, he was stationed in London and Plymouth, England, where he participated in planning the occupation and recovery of Germany. He was released from active duty in 1945 as a full Commander.\n\nIn 1921, at the age of 24, Chillingworth began his career as county judge. In 1923, he became the newly elected circuit judge, a position he held for 32 years until his death in 1955.\n\nA neighborhood park in West Palm Beach is named in honor of Chillingworth.\n\nChillingworth and his wife were last seen at a dinner in West Palm Beach, Florida, on the evening of June 14, 1955. They left the dinner about 10p.m. for their Manalapan home. They went to bed expecting a carpenter to arrive in the morning of June 15 to build a playground for their grandchildren.\n\nThe carpenter arrived at 8a.m. and observed that the Chillingworths' door had been left open and that their home appeared to be empty. Later that same day, Judge Chillingworth failed to appear as scheduled at a 10a.m. hearing at the courthouse in West Palm Beach.\n\nAn accidental drowning during a morning swim was quickly ruled out, and $40 found to be in Marjorie's pocketbook ruled out robbery. The keys were still in the ignition of Chillingworth's Plymouth. No further clues were obtained and (at that point) the case went cold. In 1957, Curtis and Marjorie Chillingworth were declared legally dead. Several suspects were considered, including Charles Nelson, brother of Chillingworth's friend Trapper Nelson, whose trial for murder Chillingworth had presided over.\n\nWhen in 1953 Joseph Peel represented both sides in a divorce, he was severely reprimanded by Chillingworth. In June 1955, Peel was slated to appear in court to answer charges of unethical conduct in yet another divorce case; disbarment was a possible consequence. At this point, Peel was using his position as an elected municipal judge to protect bolita operators and moonshiners by giving them advance warnings of raids in return for financial consideration. Disbarment would mean the loss of his position and therefore his lucrative illegal racket.\n\nBy early June 1955, Peel was in a panic. The top legal officer in the county, Chillingworth, had already stated that Peel would get no second chance. Peel then hired Floyd \"Lucky\" Holzapfel (a known criminal and a carpenter's apprentice) to murder the Chillingworths. On the night of June 14, Holzapfel and an accomplice named Bobby Lincoln went to Manalapan and landed on the beach behind the Chillingworths' house around 1a.m. Bobby Lincoln crouched in the bushes as Holzapfel knocked on the door. The judge answered in his pajamas. Holzapfel pulled a pistol from under his shirt and forced the judge and his wife into the boat. After the boat drifted for about an hour, the couple were thrown overboard with lead weights strapped to their legs.\n\nIn 1959, Holzapfel had bragged to a friend, James Yenzer, that he knew who had killed the Chillingworths, and in September 1960, Yenzer and a friend, ex-West Beach police officer Jim Wilber, lured Holzapfel to a hotel in Melbourne, Florida. Yenzer and Wilber managed to get Holzapfel drunk and discuss what he knew of the murders. Unbeknown to Holzapfel, a member of the Florida Sheriff's Bureau, tipped off by Yenzer and Wilber, was in an adjacent room in the hotel capturing his comments on tape.\n\nHolzapfel was arrested on October 1, 1960, and on December 12, 1960, he pleaded guilty to both murders. He was sent to death row, but his death sentence was commuted in 1966, and he died in prison thirty years later. On March 30, 1961, Peel was found guilty of accessory to murder. He received two life sentences, but was paroled in 1982 while in seriously ill health, and died just nine days later. The accomplice to the murder, Bobby Lincoln, finished his federal prison term in Michigan in 1962.\n\n\n"}

She had been a beauty pageant contestant.\n\nShe was the daughter of Latice Sutton and Michael Richardson. She was raised by her mother and stepfather Larry Sutton in Covina, California. Mitrice Richardson was gay, and at the time of her death, had been dating girlfriend Tessa Moon for about two years.\n\nOn the evening of September 16, 2009, Richardson entered the parking lot of Geoffrey's restaurant in Malibu. Due to what staff and patrons at the restaurant described as \"bizarre\" behavior and the fact that she was unable to pay her $89 bill, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department from the Malibu/Lost Hills Station was called to assess her condition. The officers on the scene purportedly administered a field sobriety test and determined that she was not intoxicated and not under the influence of any substance. She was arrested on charges of \"suspicion of not paying for the meal\" and possession of less than an ounce of marijuana.\n\nAccording to the arresting officers, upon her arrest, her phone, purse and money were secured in her car and her car was towed to a tow yard on the Pacific Coast Highway. Richardson was detained and booked at the Malibu/Lost Hills Sheriff's Station approximately ten miles up Malibu Canyon.\n\nAlthough Richardson's mother informed the station of concern for her daughter's mental health, and despite promises from the station personnel that she would not be released until later in the morning, Richardson was released on September 17, 2009, at 12:28 AM with no belongings and no means of calling for assistance. Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, said Richardson was released from jail because \"She exhibited no signs of mental illness or intoxication. She was fine. She's an adult.\"\n\nSeveral hours later, at 6:30 AM, she was seen in the backyard of former KTLA news anchor Bill Smith in Monte Nido. When Smith opened his window and asked if she was OK, Richardson told Smith that she was \"resting.\" Neighbors stated that they heard a woman's voice in the tennis courts of Smith's home. Others stated that they heard and saw Richardson either leaving or attempting to enter Smith's home and that she had been in the presence of a man who frequented the home for a few days after her disappearance. Neighbors also stated that they heard loud screams in a vacant home around the time that Richardson went missing. They stated that the police were called.\n\nOn January 9, 2010, four months after she was reported missing, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department conducted one of the largest-scale searches in the history of the department. Over 300 volunteers trained in search and rescue operations participated in the 18-square-mile search in the area of Malibu Canyon. The search included both air and ground searches of creeks, trails, and ridges. Richardson was not found during this search.\n\nMaurice Dubois, father of slain Escondido, California, teen Amber Dubois, assisted Richardson's family in a two-day search on June 5 and 6, 2010, in the Monte Nido, California, area of Malibu Canyon. Over 100 private-citizen volunteers participated in the search of the area. Although Richardson's remains were not discovered, searchers found racially and sexually offensive graffiti on the walls of a culvert in the canyon. The graffiti was freshly painted and paint cans, brushes and other potential evidence were left at the scene.\n\nThe creek bed in Malibu Canyon where Richardson's naked mummified remains were eventually discovered is adjacent to a 21-acre ranch that is known for producing pornography. It is very secluded and has direct access to the creek bed. When her body was discovered, the detectives on the case removed her body against the order of the coroner. Though residents reportedly heard screams in that area several nights after Richardson disappeared, her death was deemed to not be a homicide; there was no foul play.\n\nRichardson's disappearance was covered on an episode of \"Disappeared\" on the Investigation Discovery channel, entitled \"Lost in the Dark\"; it first aired on November 19, 2012 as the Season 6 premiere.\n\nRichardson's family has filed several lawsuits against the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for releasing her from jail even though, they claim, she was experiencing severe bipolar disorder at the time. In 2011, her parents, who had sued separately, were awarded $450,000 each. Richardson's girlfriend, Tessa Moon, refutes claims that Richardson had any mental illness.\n\nRichardson's family also asked the California Attorney General's office to review the sheriff's office's handling of the case. In November 2015, after reviewing 500 pages of documents sent with the request, the office of California then-Attorney General Kamala Harris replied that it had not found any grounds for criminal charges against the sheriff or his deputies. The Attorney General's office also found no evidence that the sheriff's office had mishandled Richardson's family's complaint against it. However, in January 2016, the California Attorney General's office reversed itself and announced it was beginning a criminal investigation of the case.\n\nOn December 30, 2016, the California Attorney General's office concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support criminal prosecution of anyone involved in the handling of the case.\n\n"}
{"id": "183503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183503", "title": "Description logic", "text": "Description logic\n\nDescription logics (DL) are a family of formal knowledge representation languages. Many DLs are more expressive than propositional logic but less expressive than first-order logic. In contrast to the latter, the core reasoning problems for DLs are (usually) decidable, and efficient decision procedures have been designed and implemented for these problems. There are general, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and fuzzy descriptions logics, and each description logic features a different balance between DL expressivity and reasoning complexity by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors.\n\nDLs are used in artificial intelligence to describe and reason about the relevant concepts of an application domain (known as \"terminological knowledge\"). It is of particular importance in providing a logical formalism for ontologies and the Semantic Web: the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and its profile is based on DLs. The most notable application of DLs and OWL is in biomedical informatics where DL assists in the codification of biomedical knowledge.\n\nA description logic (DL) models \"concepts\", \"roles\" and \"individuals\", and their relationships.\n\nThe fundamental modeling concept of a DL is the \"axiom\"—a logical statement relating roles and/or concepts. This is a key difference from the frames paradigm where a \"frame specification\" declares and completely defines a class.\n\nThe description logic community uses different terminology than the first-order logic (FOL) community for operationally equivalent notions; some examples are given below. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) uses again a different terminology, also given in the table below.\n\nThere are many varieties of description logics and there is an informal naming convention, roughly describing the operators allowed. The expressivity is encoded in the label for a logic starting with one of the following basic logics:\n\nFollowed by any of the following extensions:\nSome canonical DLs that do not exactly fit this convention are:\nAs an example, formula_1 is a centrally important description logic from which comparisons with other varieties can be made. formula_1 is simply formula_3 with complement of any concept allowed, not just atomic concepts. formula_1 is used instead of the equivalent formula_5.\n\nA further example, the description logic formula_6 is the logic formula_1 plus extended cardinality restrictions, and transitive and inverse roles. The naming conventions aren't purely systematic so that the logic formula_8 might be referred to as formula_9 and abbreviations are made where possible,\n\nThe Protégé ontology editor supports formula_10. Three major biomedical informatics terminology bases, SNOMED CT, GALEN, and GO, are expressible in formula_11 (with additional role properties).\n\nOWL 2 provides the expressiveness of formula_12, OWL-DL is based on formula_10, and for OWL-Lite it is formula_14.\n\nDescription logic was given its current name in the 1980s. Previous to this it was called (chronologically): \"terminological systems\", and \"concept languages\".\n\nFrames and semantic networks lack formal (logic-based) semantics. DL was first introduced into knowledge representation (KR) systems to overcome this deficiency.\n\nThe first DL-based KR system was KL-ONE (by Ronald J. Brachman and Schmolze, 1985). During the '80s other DL-based systems using \"structural subsumption algorithms\" were developed including KRYPTON (1983), LOOM (1987), BACK (1988), K-REP (1991) and CLASSIC (1991). This approach featured DL with limited expressiveness but relatively efficient (polynomial time) reasoning.\n\nIn the early '90s, the introduction of a new \"tableau based algorithm\" paradigm allowed efficient reasoning on more expressive DL. DL-based systems using these algorithms - such as KRIS (1991) - show acceptable reasoning performance on typical inference problems even though the worst case complexity is no longer polynomial.\n\nFrom the mid '90s, reasoners were created with good practical performance on very expressive DL with high worst case complexity. Examples from this period include FaCT, RACER (2001), CEL (2005), and KAON 2 (2005).\n\nDL reasoners, such as FaCT, FaCT++, RACER, DLP and Pellet, implement the method of analytic tableaux. KAON2 is implemented by algorithms which reduce a SHIQ(D) knowledge base to a disjunctive datalog program.\n\nThe DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) and Ontology Inference Layer (OIL) ontology languages for the Semantic Web can be viewed as\nsyntactic variants of DL. In particular, the formal semantics and reasoning in OIL use the formula_6 DL. The DAML+OIL DL was developed as a submission to—and formed the starting point of—the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Ontology Working Group. In 2004, the Web Ontology Working Group completed its work by issuing the OWL recommendation. The design of OWL is based on the formula_16 family of DL with OWL DL and OWL Lite based on formula_10 and formula_14 respectively.\n\nThe W3C OWL Working Group began work in 2007 on a refinement of - and extension to - OWL. In 2009, this was completed by the issuance of the OWL2 recommendation. OWL2 is based on the description logic formula_12. Practical experience demonstrated that OWL DL lacked several key features necessary to model complex domains.\n\nIn DL, a distinction is drawn between the so-called TBox (terminological box) and the ABox (assertional box). In general, the TBox contains sentences describing concept hierarchies (i.e., relations between concepts) while the ABox contains ground sentences stating where in the hierarchy individuals belong (i.e., relations between individuals and concepts). For example, the statement:\n\nbelongs in the TBox, while the statement:\n\nbelongs in the ABox.\n\nNote that the TBox/ABox distinction is not significant, in the same sense that the two \"kinds\" of sentences are not treated differently in first-order logic (which subsumes most DL). When translated into first-order logic, a subsumption axiom like () is simply a conditional restriction to unary predicates (concepts) with only variables appearing in it. Clearly, a sentence of this form is not privileged or special over sentences in which only constants (\"grounded\" values) appear like ().\n\nSo why was the distinction introduced? The primary reason is that the separation can be useful when describing and formulating decision-procedures for various DL. For example, a reasoner might process the TBox and ABox separately, in part because certain key inference problems are tied to one but not the other one ('classification' is related to the TBox, 'instance checking' to the ABox). Another example is that the complexity of the TBox can greatly affect the performance of a given decision-procedure for a certain DL, independently of the ABox. Thus, it is useful to have a way to talk about that specific part of the knowledge base.\n\nThe secondary reason is that the distinction can make sense from the knowledge base modeler's perspective. It is plausible to distinguish between our conception of terms/concepts in the world (class axioms in the TBox) and particular manifestations of those terms/concepts (instance assertions in the ABox). In the above example: when the hierarchy within a company is the same in every branch but the assignment to employees is different in every department (because there are other people working there), it makes sense to reuse the TBox for different branches that do not use the same ABox.\n\nThere are two features of description logic that are not shared by most other data description formalisms: DL does not make the Unique name assumption (UNA) or the Closed-world assumption (CWA). Not having UNA means that two concepts with different names may be allowed by some inference to be shown to be equivalent. Not having CWA, or rather having the Open world assumption (OWA) means that lack of knowledge of a fact does not immediately imply knowledge of the negation of a fact.\n\nLike first-order logic (FOL), a syntax defines which collections of symbols are legal expressions in a description logic, and semantics determine meaning. Unlike FOL, a DL may have several well known syntactic variants.\n\nThe syntax of a member of the description logic family is characterized by its recursive definition, in which the constructors that can be used to form concept terms are stated. Some constructors are related to logical constructors in first-order logic (FOL) such as \"intersection\" or \"conjunction\" of concepts, \"union\" or \"disjunction\" of concepts, \"negation\" or \"complement\" of concepts, \"universal restriction\" and \"existential restriction\". Other constructors have no corresponding construction in FOL including restrictions on roles for example, inverse, transitivity and functionality.\n\nLet C and D be concepts, a and b be individuals, and R be a role.\n\nIf a is R-related to b, then b is called an R-successor of a.\n\nThe prototypical DL \"Attributive Concept Language with Complements\" (formula_1) was introduced by Manfred Schmidt-Schauß and Gert Smolka in 1991, and is the basis of many more expressive DLs. The following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al.\n\nLet formula_21, formula_22 and formula_23 be (respectively) sets of \"concept names\" (also known as \"atomic concepts\"), \"role names\" and \"individual names\" (also known as \"individuals\", \"nominals\" or \"objects\"). Then the ordered triple (formula_21, formula_22, formula_23) is the \"signature\".\n\nThe set of formula_1 \"concepts\" is the smallest set such that:\n\n\nA \"general concept inclusion\" (GCI) has the form formula_39 where formula_31 and formula_32 are \"concepts\". Write formula_42 when formula_39 and formula_44. A \"TBox\" is any finite set of GCIs.\n\n\nAn \"ABox\" is a finite set of assertional axioms.\n\nA \"knowledge base\" (KB) is an ordered pair formula_49 for TBox formula_50 and ABox formula_51.\n\nThe semantics of description logics are defined by interpreting concepts as sets of individuals and roles as sets of ordered pairs of individuals. Those individuals are typically assumed from a given domain. The semantics of non-atomic concepts and roles is then defined in terms of atomic concepts and roles. This is done by using a recursive definition similar to the syntax.\n\nThe following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al.\n\nA \"terminological interpretation\" formula_52 over a \"signature\" formula_53 consists of\nsuch that\n\nDefine formula_67 (read \"in I holds\") as follows\n\n\n\nLet formula_80 be a knowledge base.\n\n\nIn addition to the ability to describe concepts formally, one also would like to employ the description of a set of concepts to ask questions about the concepts and instances described. The most common decision problems are basic database-query-like questions like \"instance checking\" (is a particular instance (member of an A-box) a member of a given concept) and \"relation checking\" (does a relation/role hold between two instances, in other words does a have property b), and the more global-database-questions like \"subsumption\" (is a concept a subset of another concept), and \"concept consistency\" (is there no contradiction among the definitions or chain of definitions). The more operators one includes in a logic and the more complicated the T-box (having cycles, allowing non-atomic concepts to include each other), usually the higher the computational complexity is for each of these problems (see Description Logic Complexity Navigator for examples).\n\nMany DLs are decidable fragments of first-order logic (FOL) and are usually fragments of two-variable logic or guarded logic. In addition, some DLs have features that are not covered in FOL; this includes \"concrete domains\" (such as integer or strings, which can be used as ranges for roles such as \"hasAge\" or \"hasName\") or an operator on roles for the transitive closure of that role.\n\nFuzzy description logics combines fuzzy logic with DLs. Since many concepts that are needed for intelligent systems lack well defined boundaries, or precisely defined criteria of membership, fuzzy logic is needed to deal with notions of vagueness and imprecision. This offers a motivation for a generalization of description logic towards dealing with imprecise and vague concepts.\n\nDescription logic is related to—but developed independently of—modal logic (ML). Many—but not all—DL are syntactic variants of ML.\n\nIn general, an object corresponds to a possible world, a concept corresponds to a modal proposition, and a role-bounded quantifier to a modal operator with that role as its accessibility relation.\n\nOperations on roles (such as composition, inversion, etc.) correspond to the modal operations used in dynamic logic.\n\nTemporal description logic represents—and allows reasoning about—time dependent concepts and many different approaches to this problem exist. For example, a description logic might be combined with a modal temporal logic such as linear temporal logic.\n\n\n\n\nThere are some semantic reasoners that deal with OWL and DL. These are some of the most popular:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19361526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19361526", "title": "Desire", "text": "Desire\n\nDesire is a sense of longing or hoping for a person, object, or outcome. The same sense is expressed by emotions such as \"craving\". When a person desires something or someone, their sense of longing is excited by the enjoyment or the thought of the item or person, and they want to take actions to obtain their goal. The motivational aspect of desire has long been noted by philosophers; Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) asserted that human desire is the fundamental motivation of all human action.\n\nWhile desires are often classified as emotions by laypersons, psychologists often describe desires as different from emotions; psychologists tend to argue that desires arise from bodily structures, such as the stomach's need for food, whereas emotions arise from a person's mental state. Marketing and advertising companies have used psychological research on how desire is stimulated to find more effective ways to induce consumers into buying a given product or service. While some advertising attempts to give buyers a sense of lack or wanting, other types of advertising create desire associating the product with desirable attributes, by showing either a celebrity or a model with the product.\n\nThe theme of desire is at the core of romance novels, which often create drama by showing cases where human desire is impeded by social conventions, class, or cultural barriers. The theme of desire is also used in other literary genres, such as Gothic novels (e.g., \"Dracula\" by Bram Stoker, in which desire is mingled with fear and dread). Poets ranging from Homer to Toni Morrison have dealt with the theme of desire in their work. Just as desire is central to the written fiction genre of romance, it is the central theme of melodrama films, which use plots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience by showing \"crises of human emotion, failed romance or friendship\", in which desire is thwarted or unrequited.\n\nIn philosophy, desire has been identified as a philosophical problem since Antiquity. In \"The Republic\", Plato argues that individual desires must be postponed in the name of the higher ideal. In \"De Anima\", Aristotle claims that desire is implicated in animal interactions and the propensity of animals to motion; at the same time, he acknowledges that reasoning also interacts with desire.\n\nHobbes (1588–1679) proposed the concept of psychological hedonism, which asserts that the \"fundamental motivation of all human action is the desire for pleasure.\" Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677) had a view which contrasted with Hobbes, in that \"he saw natural desires as a form of bondage\" that are not chosen by a person of their own free will. David Hume (1711–1776) claimed that desires and passions are non-cognitive, automatic bodily responses, and he argued that reasoning is \"capable only of devising means to ends set by [bodily] desire\".\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724–1804) called any action based on desires a hypothetical imperative, meaning by this that it is a command of reason that applies only if one desires the goal in question. Kant also established a relation between the beautiful and pleasure in \"Critique of Judgment\". Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel claimed that \"self-consciousness is desire\".\n\nBecause desire can cause humans to become obsessed and embittered, it has been called one of the causes of woe for mankind. Within the teachings of Buddhism, craving is thought to be the cause of all suffering that one experiences in human existence. The eradication of craving leads one to ultimate happiness, or Nirvana. However, desire for wholesome things is seen as liberating and enhancing. While the stream of desire for sense-pleasures must be cut eventually, a practitioner on the path to liberation is encouraged by the Buddha to \"generate desire\" for the fostering of skillful qualities and the abandoning of unskillful ones.\n\nIn Hinduism, the Rig Veda's creation myth Nasadiya Sukta states regarding the one (ekam) spirit: \"In the beginning there was Desire (kama) that was first seed of mind. Poets found the bond of being in non-being in their heart's thought\".\n\nIn Buddhism, for an individual to effect his or her liberation, the flow of sense-desire must be cut completely; however, while training, he or she must work with motivational processes based on skillfully applied desire. According to the early Buddhist scriptures, the Buddha stated that monks should \"generate desire\" for the sake of fostering skillful qualities and abandoning unskillful ones.\n\nThere is a double message here between what Buddha said, that desire must be created, and what some monks propose to their followers, that desire must be cut.\nTruth is Buddhism entails two aspects: the ideas monks taught to civilize peasantry, on the one hand, and the esoteric teachings of tantra (aimed at leaders) for self-realization, on the other, where—just as Buddha said—desire must be generated.\nDr. Oscar R. Gómez holds that teachings imparted privately by H.H. 14th Dalai Lama are meant for leaders to be able to choose a specific desire consciously by creating it previously from the inside. People have a tendency to live based on desires coming from the outside, and such desires are the ones making choices for them. As an alternative, tantric Tibetan Buddhism allows to choose a desire consciously; to create desire rather than being created by it.\n\nWithin Christianity, desire is seen as something that can either lead a person towards God and destiny or away from him. Desire is not considered to be a bad thing in and of itself; rather, it is a powerful force within the human that, once submitted to the Lordship of Christ, can become a tool for good, for advancement, and for abundant living.\n\nWhile desires are often classified as emotions by laypersons, psychologists often describe desires as different from emotions. For psychologists, desires arise from bodily structures and functions (e.g., the stomach needing food and the blood needing oxygen). On the other hand, emotions arise from a person's mental state. A 2008 study by the University of Michigan indicated that, while humans experience desire and fear as psychological opposites, they share the same brain circuit. A 2008 study entitled \"The Neural Correlates of Desire\" showed that the human brain categorizes stimuli according to its desirability by activating three different brain areas: the superior orbitofrontal cortex, the mid-cingulate cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex.\n\nIn affective neuroscience, \"desire\" and \"wanting\" are operationally defined as motivational salience; the form of \"desire\" or \"wanting\" associated with a rewarding stimulus (i.e., a stimulus which acts as a positive reinforcer, such as palatable food, an attractive mate, or an addictive drug) is called \"incentive salience\" and research has demonstrated that incentive salience, the sensation of pleasure, and positive reinforcement are all derived from neuronal activity within the reward system. Studies have shown that dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens shell and endogenous opioid signaling in the ventral pallidum are at least partially responsible for mediating an individual's desire (i.e., incentive salience) for a rewarding stimulus and the subjective perception of pleasure derived from experiencing or \"consuming\" a rewarding stimulus (e.g., pleasure derived from eating palatable food, sexual pleasure from intercourse with an attractive mate, or euphoria from using an addictive drug). Research also shows that the orbitofrontal cortex has connections to both the opioid and dopamine systems, and stimulating this cortex is associated with subjective reports of pleasure.\n\nAustrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud, who is best known for his theories of the unconscious mind and the defense mechanism of repression and for creating the clinical practice of psychoanalysis, proposed the notion of the Oedipus complex, which argues that desire for the mother creates neuroses in their sons. Freud used the Greek myth of Oedipus to argue that people desire incest and must repress that desire. He claimed that children pass through several stages, including a stage in which they fixate on the mother as a sexual object.\nThat this \"complex\" is universal has long since been disputed. Even if it were true, that would not explain those neuroses in daughters, but only in sons. While it is true that sexual confusion \"can\" be aberrative in a few cases, there is no credible evidence to suggest that it is a universal scenario. While Freud was correct in labeling the various symptoms behind most compulsions, phobias and disorders, he was largely incorrect in his theories regarding the etiology of what he identified.\n\nFrench psychoanalyst and psychiatrist Jacques Lacan (1901–1981) argues that desire first occurs during a \"mirror phase\" of a baby's development, when the baby sees an image of wholeness in a mirror which gives them a desire for that being. As a person matures, Lacan claims that they still feel separated from themselves by language, which is incomplete, and so a person continually strives to become whole. He uses the term \"jouissance\" to refer to the lost object or feeling of absence which a person believes to be unobtainable. For more details on the Lacanian conception of desire, see desire (psychoanalysis). \n\nIn the field of marketing, desire is the human appetite for a given object of attention. Desire for a product is stimulated by advertising, which attempts to give buyers a sense of lack or wanting. In store retailing, merchants attempt to increase the desire of the buyer by showcasing the product attractively, in the case of clothes or jewellery, or, for food stores, by offering samples. With print, TV, and radio advertising, desire is created by giving the potential buyer a sense of lacking (\"Are you still driving that old car?\") or by associating the product with desirable attributes, either by showing a celebrity using or wearing the product, or by giving the product a \"halo effect\" by showing attractive models with the product. Nike's \"Just Do It\" ads for sports shoes are appealing to consumers' desires for self-betterment.\n\nIn some cases, the potential buyer already has the desire for the product before they enter the store, as in the case of a decorating buff entering their favorite furniture store. The role of the salespeople in these cases is simply to guide the customer towards making a choice; they do not have to try to \"sell\" the general idea of making a purchase, because the customer already wants the products. In other cases, the potential buyer does not have a desire for the product or service, and so the company has to create the sense of desire. An example of this situation is for life insurance. Most young adults are not thinking about dying, so they are not naturally thinking about how they need to have accidental death insurance. Life insurance companies, though, are attempting to create a desire for life insurance with advertising that shows pictures of children and asks \"If anything happens to you, who will pay for the children's upkeep?\".\n\nMarketing theorists call desire the third stage in the hierarchy of effects, which occurs when the buyer develops a sense that if they felt the need for the type of product in question, the advertised product is what would quench their desire.\n\nThe theme of desire is at the core of the romance novel. Novels which are based around the theme of desire, which can range from a long aching feeling to an unstoppable torrent, include \"Madame Bovary\" by Gustave Flaubert; \"Love in the Time of Cholera\" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez; \"Lolita\" by Vladimir Nabokov; \"Jane Eyre\" by Charlotte Brontë, and \"Dracula\" by Bram Stoker. Brontë's characterization of Jane Eyre depicts her as torn by an inner conflict between reason and desire, because \"customs\" and \"conventionalities\" stand in the way of her romantic desires. E.M. Forster's novels use homoerotic codes to describe same-sex desire and longing. Close male friendships with subtle homoerotic undercurrents occur in every novel, which subverts the conventional, heterosexual plot of the novels. In the Gothic-themed \"Dracula\", Stoker depicts the theme of desire which is coupled with fear. When the Lucy character is seduced by Dracula, she describes her sensations in the graveyard as a mixture of fear and blissful emotion.\n\nPoet W.B. Yeats depicts the positive and negative aspects of desire in his poems such as \"The Rose for the World\", \"Adam's Curse\", \"No Second Troy\", \"All Things can Tempt me\", and \"Meditations in Time of Civil War\". Some poems depict desire as a poison for the soul; Yeats worked through his desire for his beloved, Maud Gonne, and realized that \"Our longing, our craving, our thirsting for something other than Reality is what dissatisfies us\". In \"The Rose for the World\", he admires her beauty, but feels pain because he cannot be with her. In the poem \"No Second Troy\", Yeats overflows with anger and bitterness because of their unrequited love. Poet T. S. Eliot dealt with the themes of desire and homoeroticism in his poetry, prose and drama. Other poems on the theme of desire include John Donne's poem \"To His Mistress Going to Bed\", Carol Ann Duffy's longings in \"Warming Her Pearls\"; Ted Hughes' \"Lovesong\" about the savage intensity of desire; and Wendy Cope's humorous poem \"Song\".\n\nPhilippe Borgeaud's novels analyse how emotions such as erotic desire and seduction are connected to fear and wrath by examining cases where people are worried about issues of impurity, sin, and shame.\n\nJust as desire is central to the written fiction genre of romance, it is the central theme of melodrama films, which are a subgenre of the drama film. Like drama, a melodrama depends mostly on in-depth character development, interaction, and highly emotional themes. Melodramatic films tend to use plots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience. Melodramatic plots often deal with \"crises of human emotion, failed romance or friendship, strained familial situations, tragedy, illness, neuroses, or emotional and physical hardship.\" Film critics sometimes use the term \"pejoratively to connote an unrealistic, bathos-filled, campy tale of romance or domestic situations with stereotypical characters (often including a central female character) that would directly appeal to feminine audiences.\" Also called \"women's movies\", \"weepies\", tearjerkers, or \"chick flicks\".\n\n\"Melodrama… is Hollywood's fairly consistent way of treating desire and subject identity\", as can be seen in well-known films such as \"Gone with the Wind\", in which \"desire is the driving force for both Scarlett and the hero, Rhett\". Scarlett desires love, money, the attention of men, and the vision of being a virtuous \"true lady\". Rhett Butler desires to be with Scarlett, which builds to a burning longing that is ultimately his undoing, because Scarlett keeps refuses his advances; when she finally confesses her secret desire, Rhett is worn out and his longing is spent.\n\nIn Cathy Cupitt's article on \"Desire and Vision in Blade Runner\", she argues that film, as a \"visual narrative form, plays with the voyeuristic desires of its audience\". Focusing on the dystopian 1980s science fiction film \"Blade Runner\", she calls the film an \"Object of Visual Desire\", in which it plays to an \"expectation of an audience's delight in visual texture, with the 'retro-fitted' spectacle of the post-modern city to ogle\" and with the use of the \"motif of the 'eye'\". In the film, \"desire is a key motivating influence on the narrative of the film, both in the 'real world', and within the text.\"\n\nBarry Long defined desire as stress or strain. It is a tension between an individual and the thing or state that that individual desires. As the thing does not feel this stress, the desiring is a one-way tension within the individual, an apparent reaching out towards the desired object or person.\n\nWhen the person responds in the way desired, or the object is attained, the desire settles down into a relationship. A relationship is identifiable by the presence of an attitude in yourself which reacts in terms of \"mine\".\n\nWhen a desire has been reduced to the level of a habit or idea it can be dealt with and eliminated fairly quickly by observation - seeing it for what it is.

DAI is closely related to and a predecessor of the field of Multi-Agent Systems.\n\nDistributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is an approach to solving complex learning, planning, and decision making problems. It is embarrassingly parallel, thus able to exploit large scale computation and spatial distribution of computing resources. These properties allow it to solve problems that require the processing of very large data sets. DAI systems consist of autonomous learning processing nodes (agents), that are distributed, often at a very large scale. DAI nodes can act independently and partial solutions are integrated by communication between nodes, often asynchronously. By virtue of their scale, DAI systems are robust and elastic, and by necessity, loosely coupled. Furthermore, DAI systems are built to be adaptive to changes in the problem definition or underlying data sets due to the scale and difficulty in redeployment.\n\nDAI systems do not require all the relevant data to be aggregated in a single location, in contrast to monolithic or centralized Artificial Intelligence systems which have tightly coupled and geographically close processing nodes. Therefore, DAI systems often operate on sub-samples or hashed impressions of very large datasets. In addition, the source dataset may change or be updated during the course of the execution of a DAI system.\n\nThe objectives of Distributed Artificial Intelligence are to solve the reasoning, planning, learning and perception problems of Artificial Intelligence, especially if they require large data, by distributing the problem to autonomous processing nodes (agents). To reach the objective, DAI requires:\n\nThere are many reasons for wanting to distribute intelligence or cope with multi-agent systems. Mainstream problems in DAI research include the following:\n\nIn the 1975 distributed artificial intelligence emerged as a subfield of artificial intelligence that dealt with interaction of intelligent agents[2]. Distributed artificial intelligence systems were conceived as a group of intelligent entities, called agents, that interacted by cooperation, by coexistence or by competition. DAI is categorized into Multi-agent systems and distributed problem solving [1]. In Multi-agent systems the main focus is how agents coordinate their knowledge and activities. For distributed problem solving the major focus is how the problem is decomposed and the solutions are synthesized.\n\nMulti-agent systems and distributed problem solving are the two main DAI approaches. There are numerous applications and tools.\n\nTwo types of DAI has emerged: \n\nDAI can apply a bottom-up approach to AI, similar to the subsumption architecture as well as the traditional top-down\napproach of AI. In addition, DAI can also be a vehicle for emergence.\n\nAreas where DAI have been applied are:\n\n\nNotion of Agents: Agents can be described as distinct entities with standard boundaries and interfaces designed for problem solving.\n\nNotion of Multi-Agents:Multi-Agent system is defined as a network of agents which are loosely coupled working as a single entity like society for problem solving that an individual agent cannot solve.\n\nThe key concept used in DPS and MABS is the abstraction called software agents. An agent is a virtual (or physical) entity that has an understanding of its environment and acts upon it. An agent is usually able to communicate with other agents in the same system to achieve a common goal, that one agent alone could not achieve. This communication system uses an agent communication language.\n\nA first classification that is useful is to divide agents into:\n\nWell-recognized agent architectures that describe how an agent is internally structured are:\n\nThe challenges in Distributed AI are:\n\n1.How to carry out communication and interaction of agents and which communication language or protocols should be used.\n\n2.How to ensure the coherency of agents.\n\n3.How to synthesise the results among 'intelligent agents' group by formulation, description, decomposition and allocation.\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence Review, 6(1):35-66, 1992.\nintelligence, pages 187-210, 1996.\nand design support.

A stumpy-tailed, portly, and unattractive tabby cat, he was a favourite of Lear's and played an important role as a companion in the poet's lonely later years. Foss is mentioned frequently in Lear's correspondence and makes an appearance in his illustrations and at least one poem. Foss is said to have been the inspiration for the pussycat in Lear's illustrations for his poem \"The Owl and the Pussycat\". The funeral that Lear provided for Foss, which included an epigraphed headstone, is said to have been more elaborate than Lear's own.\n\nFoss is said to have been adopted by Edward Lear whilst a kitten in 1873, though he was later claimed by Lear to be older. His full name was the Greek Aderphos, but he was generally known by the shortened form of \"Foss\" or, particularly by Lear, \"Old Foss\". Foss was a tabby cat described as unattractive. His tail was cut short by Lear's servants in an attempt to prevent him from wandering. No photographs survive of the cat, as he jumped out of Lear's arms on the only occasion when one was to be taken.\n\nLear grew fond of Foss and he was said to be his favourite animal. Foss was mentioned often in Lear's correspondence, to the extent that he was said to have been almost as famous as Lear at the time. He was said to roll on Lear's manuscripts to help dry the ink. Many accounts say that when Lear was planning his relocation to Sanremo, he had his architect design his new villa on the same floorplan as his previous home to avoid confusing Foss. Despite this on his first day in the villa Foss climbed into one of its chimneys.\n\nFoss is said to have been the model for the pussycat in Lear's \"The Owl and the Pussycat\" illustrations, though he chose to depict a full-length tail. Foss is also mentioned in Lear's poem \"How Pleasant to Know Mr Lear\":\nThere are also many drawings by Lear of Foss including the two together and a series depicting Foss in supposed heraldic poses – these include couchant, passant, rampant, regardant, and the more fanciful \"dansant\" (dancing) and \"a untin\" (hunting). The \"New York Times\" stated that Lear's illustrations of Foss were his best caricatures.\n\nFoss was a key companion in Lear's later years at a time when Lear was battling depression and loneliness. Foss died at Lear's Villa Tennyson in Sanremo in November 1887, just two months before Lear's own death. Foss has been reported as being 14, 16 or 17 years old at the time of his death, though Lear was convinced that he was much older and had the age of 31 years engraved on Foss' headstone. Some of Lear's pre-1872 drawings depict a cat very similar to Foss with a stumpy tail, tabby markings, and a portly appearance, and it is possible that Lear, knowingly or otherwise, conflated his imagined cat with the real Foss.\n\nFoss was buried under his own headstone – with an epitaph composed by Lear – beneath a fig tree in the garden at Villa Tennyson. Foss' funeral is said to have had greater pomp and ceremony than Lear's own, which was poorly attended. Foss is mentioned in the song \"Mr Lear\" by British folk singer Al Stewart on his 2005 album \"A Beach Full of Shells\".\n"}

He died in a secret CIA prison, or black site, located in northern Kabul, Afghanistan and known as the Salt Pit. He had been captured October 29, 2002.\n\nHis name was kept secret by the United States for more than seven years although his death was announced. In 2010 the Associated Press reported that before his death he was left half-stripped and chained against a concrete wall on a night when the temperature was close to freezing. The United States government did not notify his family (wife and four daughters) of his death, according to the report.\n\nGul Rahman was captured and arrested on 29 October 2002 during a joint operation by U.S. agents and Pakistani security forces against Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin. He was reportedly arrested with the physician Ghairat Baheer, the son-in-law of the warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who leads the insurgent faction Hezb-e-Islami. Rahman had traveled from Peshawar to Islamabad, Pakistan for a medical checkup when he was arrested at the home of Ghairat Baheer, and subsequently flown by the CIA to Afghanistan.\n\nU.S. officials claim Rahman was \"violently uncooperative\" while in custody at the Salt Pit, the CIA code name for an abandoned brick factory that had been turned into a CIA black site or covert interrogation center, including threatening to kill his guards – who responded by beating him. Rahman was also subjected to \"48 hours of sleep deprivation, auditory overload, total darkness, isolation, a cold shower and rough treatment\". Gul Rahman reportedly died on 20 November 2002 after being stripped naked from the waist down and shackled to a cold cement wall in the Salt Pit, where temperatures were approximately .\n\nThis technique of shackling is known as \"short-chaining.\" The detainee is shackled \"in a short chain position, which prevents prisoners from standing upright.\" A CIA pathologist reported that Rahman \"likely\" froze to death.\n\nHis death prompted an internal CIA review and the development of improved guidance. No one was ever charged in his death.\n\nAccording to Gul's brother, Habib Rahman, Gul Rahman was involved in a 1994 rescue of Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan since 2004. Karzai had been imprisoned by the government forces, and Rahman was working for Hekmatyar, whose forces fired rockets at the building while Rahman entered and freed Karzai. Rahman took him to a safe house in Kabul.\n\nOn December 9, 2014 the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on CIA torture was published.\nAccording to that report he had been subjected to total darkness, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, cold shower, \"rough treatment\", short shackling and finally froze to death. The report said he was the only captive known to have died in CIA custody.\n\nSteven W. Hawkins, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, writing in \"The Guardian\", reported that he found that the CIA official responsible for Rahman's death, Jose Rodriguez was not only not punished, or sanctioned, rather, he received a cash bonus for his \"consistently superior work\".\n\nOn October 13, 2015 the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of Rahman's estate and two other former detainees against two psychologists, James Mitchell and John Jessen, who they maintain were responsible for designing the protocols that resulted in Rahman's death and the torture of the other two plaintifs. The ACLU case is the first lawsuit brought against significant individuals identified in the Senate report since it was published. On July 28, 2017, U.S. District Judge Justin Lowe Quackenbush denied both parties motions for summary judgment, noted that the defendants are indemnified by the United States government, and encouraged the attorneys to reach a settlement before trial.\n\n"}

He is a former professor and chairman of the art department at Northern Kentucky University. In 2000, he authored \"My Descent Into Death\", which chronicles his alleged near-death experience. Storm's near-death experience has been cited in literature on near-death studies, and his book has garnered endorsement by gothic fiction writer Anne Rice before it was acquired by Doubleday and republished in 2005. Storm has retold his story on NBC's \"Today Show\", \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", \"48 Hours\", \"Discovery Channel\" and \"Coast to Coast AM\".\n\nHoward Storm was born in Newton, Massachusetts. He graduated from the University of California Berkeley with a master's degree, and he later became an art professor at Northern Kentucky University, a position he held for 20 years. During an interview with \"Unsolved Mysteries\" in 1997, he reported of his life prior to his near-death experience that he was an atheist and an aggressive person, feared by his wife and children.\n\nIn June 1985, Storm took a group of his students on a field trip to Europe. After returning to his Paris hotel room with his wife around 11:00 a.m. from a morning excursion, he had a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. He was evaluated at a Paris hospital and diagnosed with a duodenal perforation, which required surgery. The soonest a surgeon could perform this procedure was around 9:00 p.m. that day. As he lay waiting for surgery, he truly believed that he was going to die due to the severity of his pain and so mentally prepared himself for death. After saying goodbye to his wife, he eventually passed out.\n\nStorm reports the following subconscious experience: He opened his eyes and found himself standing outside of his body, looking down at the hospital bed with his wife crying beside him. He was without pain and hypersensitive. His wife could not see or hear him. He was then drawn by voices calling his name outside the hospital room, and he followed them, believing they were taking him to a doctor. He describes pale humanoid creatures that urged him down the hallway, saying that they had been waiting for him. The creatures became increasingly hostile, and upon refusing to continue following, they began to attack him. He then heard a voice saying, \"pray to God,\" and so he recited fragment Bible verses and the Pledge of Allegiance. With mention of the word \"God,\" the creatures would retract, and eventually he was alone again. After a period of time, he called out for Jesus to save him, and suddenly was rescued by \"spiritual beings of light.\"\n\nThereafter, he had a recollection of his entire life, a life review, which highlighted some negative aspects of his life, before the \"beings of light\" answered his questions. They told him that the United States was a \"blessed nation\" but one which required a change lest lose its prosperity. He describes visions of a future plagued by war, natural disasters and despair, but which could be avoided should there be a major spiritual \"shift\" in the consciousness of the world. These beings told him that the \"correct religion\" is that religion which \"brings you closest to God.\"\n\nWhen he awoke, he was being prepped for surgery, which repaired the duodenal perforation. In the following days, he reports that he was visited by a doctor upon whose arrival the room lightened, and upon his exit, it darkened again. The nurse (who's desk was just outside Storm's room) had seen nothing. Storm also recounts \"a Voice\" that told him to ignore the advice of doctors and buy return tickets to the U.S. a week after his procedure, which he did. Upon his arrival in Cincinnati, he was admitted in the hospital in critical condition with double pneumonia, collapsed lung, extreme peritonitis, and non-A non-B hepatitis. His recovery took five weeks, and he reported a period of 7 months of extreme weakness before he was able to return to work.\nStorm concedes that there is no medical evidence to suggest that he actually died.\n\nStorm stated that over time he \"became more tempered\" about his experience. He became involved with a church, entered the seminary, and was ordained. He served as pastor of Zion United Church of Christ in Norwood, Ohio from 1992 to 2005, and he was also a pastor of the Covington United Church of Christ in Covington, Ohio.\n\n"}

Concepts of spirituality, intuition, and metaphysics are considered subjectively valuable only, primarily because they are unfalsifiable, and therefore can never progress beyond the realm of personal opinion. A boundary is not drawn between nature and what lies \"beyond\" nature; everything is regarded as a result of explainable processes within nature, with nothing lying outside it. \nThe belief is that all living things are intricate extensions of nature, and therefore deserve some degree of mutual respect from human beings. Naturalists accept the need for adaptation to current change, however it may be, and also that life must feed upon life for survival. However, they also recognize the necessity for a fair exchange of resources between all species. Humanistic naturalists are generally concerned with the ethical aspects of \"worldview naturalism.\"\nIndustry and technology are sometimes regarded as enemies to naturalism, but this is not always the case. For those who do believe in such threats, the thought is that the majority of human history, societies were largely agricultural and hunter-gatherer and lived in relative harmony and balance with nature. With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, some humanistic naturalists see this balance as being increasingly threatened. This view has some similarities with anarcho-primitivism and other anti-modernist perspectives.\n\n"}
{"id": "27455497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27455497", "title": "Hun and po", "text": "Hun and po\n\nHun () and po () are types of souls in Chinese philosophy and traditional religion. Within this ancient soul dualism tradition, every living human has both a \"hun\" spiritual, ethereal, yang soul which leaves the body after death, and also a \"po\" corporeal, substantive, yin soul which remains with the corpse of the deceased. Some controversy exists over the number of souls in a person; for instance, one of the traditions within Daoism proposes a soul structure of \"sanhunqipo\" 三魂七魄; that is, \"three \"hun\" and seven \"po\"\". The historian Yü Ying-shih describes \"hun\" and \"po\" as \"two pivotal concepts that have been, and remain today, the key to understanding Chinese views of the human soul and the afterlife.\"\n\nThe Chinese characters 魂 and 魄 for \"hun\" and \"po\" typify the most common character classification of \"radical-phonetic\" or \"phono-semantic\" graphs, which combine a \"radical\" or \"signific\" (recurring graphic elements that roughly provide semantic information) with a \"phonetic\" (suggesting ancient pronunciation). \"Hun\" (or 䰟) and \"po\" have the \"ghost radical\" \"gui\" \"ghost; devil\" and phonetics of \"yun\" \"cloud; cloudy\" and \"bai\" \"white; clear; pure\".\n\nBesides the common meaning of \"a soul\", \"po\" 魄 was a variant Chinese character for \"po\" \"a lunar phase\" and \"po\" \"dregs\". The \"Book of Documents\" used \"po\" 魄 as a graphic variant for \"po\" 霸 \"dark aspect of the moon\" – this character usually means \"ba\" 霸 \"overlord; hegemon\". For example, \"On the third month, when (the growth phase, 生魄) of the moon began to wane, the duke of Chow [i.e., Duke of Zhou] commenced the foundations, and proceeded to build the new great city of Lǒ\" (tr. Legge 1865:434). The \"Zhuangzi\" \"[Writings of] Master Zhuang\" wrote \"zaopo\" 糟粕 (lit. \"rotten dregs\") \"worthless; unwanted; waste matter\" with a \"po\" 魄 variant. A wheelwright sees Duke Huan of Qi with books by dead sages and says, \"what you are reading there is nothing but the [糟魄] chaff and dregs of the men of old!\" (tr. Watson 1968:152).\n\nIn the history of Chinese writing, characters for \"po\" 魄/霸 \"lunar brightness\" appeared before those for \"hun\" 魂 \"soul; spirit\". The spiritual \"hun\" 魂 and \"po\" 魄 \"dual souls\" are first recorded in Warring States period (475–221 BCE) seal script characters. The lunar \"po\" 魄 or 霸 \"moon's brightness\" appears in both Zhou dynasty (1045–256 BCE) Bronzeware script and oracle bone script, but not in Shang dynasty (ca. 1600–1046 BCE) oracle inscriptions. The earliest form of this \"lunar brightness\" character was found on a (ca. 11th century BCE) Zhou oracle bone inscription (Yü 1987:370).\n\nThe \"po\" soul's etymology is better understood than the \"hun\" soul's. Schuessler (2007:290, 417) reconstructs \"hun\" 魂 \"'spiritual soul' which makes a human personality\" and \"po\" 魄 \"vegetative or animal soul … which accounts for growth and physiological functions\" as Middle Chinese \"γuən\" and \"pʰak\" from Old Chinese *\"wûn\" and *\"phrâk\".\n\nThe (ca. 80 CE) \"Baihu Tang\" 白虎堂 gave pseudo-etymologies for \"hun\" and \"po\" through Chinese character puns. It explains \"hun\" 魂 with \"zhuan\" 傳 \"deliver; pass on; impart; spread\" and \"yun\" 芸 \"rue (used to keep insects out of books); to weed\", and \"po\" 魄 with \"po\" 迫 \" compel; force; coerce; urgent\" and \"bai\" 白 \"white; bright\".\n\nWhat do the words \"hun\" and [\"po\"] mean? \"Hun\" expresses the idea of continuous propagation ([\"zhuan\"] 傳), unresting flight; it is the \"qi\" of the Lesser Yang, working in man in an external direction, and it governs the nature (or the instincts, [\"xing\"] 性). [\"Po\"] expresses the idea of a continuous pressing urge ([\"po\"] 迫) on man; it is the [\"qi\"] of the Lesser Yin, and works in him, governing the emotions ([\"qing\"] 情). \"Hun\" is connected with the idea of weeding ([\"yun\"] 芸), for with the instincts the evil weeds (in man's nature) are removed. [\"Po\"] is connected with the idea of brightening ([\"bai\"] 白), for with the emotions the interior (of the personality) is governed. (tr. Needham and Lu 1974:87) \n\nEtymologically, Schuessler says \"pò\" 魄 \"animal soul\" \"is the same word as\" \"pò\" 霸 \"a lunar phase\". He cites the \"Zuozhuan\" (534 BCE, see below) using the lunar \"jishengpo\" 既生魄 to mean \"With the first development of a fetus grows the vegetative soul\".\n\"Pò\", the soul responsible for growth, is the same as \"pò\" the waxing and waning of the moon\". The meaning 'soul' has probably been transferred from the moon since men must have been aware of lunar phases long before they had developed theories on the soul. This is supported by the etymology 'bright', and by the inverted word order which can only have originated with meteorological expressions … The association with the moon explains perhaps why the \"pò\" soul is classified as Yin … in spite of the etymology 'bright' (which should be Yang), hun's Yang classificiation may be due to the association with clouds and by extension sky, even though the word invokes 'dark'. 'Soul' and 'moon' are related in other cultures, by cognation or convergence, as in Tibeto-Burman and Proto-Lolo–Burmese *\"s/ʼ-la\" \"moon; soul; spirit\", Written Tibetan cognates \"bla\" \"soul\" and \"zla\" \"moon\", and Proto-Miao–Yao *\"bla\" \"spirit; soul; moon\". (2007:417) \n\nLunar associations of \"po\" are evident in the Classical Chinese terms \"chanpo\" 蟾魄 \"the moon\" (with \"toad; toad in the moon; moon\") and \"haopo\" 皓魄 \"moon; moonlight\" (with \"white; bright; luminous\").\n\nThe semantics of \"po\" 魄 \"white soul\" probably originated with 霸 \"lunar whiteness\". Zhou bronze inscriptions commonly recorded lunar phases with the terms \"jishengpo\" 既生魄 \"after the brightness has grown\" and \"jisipo\" 既死魄 \"after the brightness has died\", which Schuessler explains as \"second quarter of the lunar month\" and \"last quarter of the lunar month\". Chinese scholars have variously interpreted these two terms as lunar quarters or fixed days, and (Shaughnessy 1992:136–145) Wang Guowei's lunar-quarter analysis the most likely. Thus, \"jishengpo\" is from the 7th/8th to the 14th/15th days of the lunar month and \"jisipo\" is from the 23rd/24th to the end of the month. Yü (1987:370) translates them as \"after the birth of the crescent\" and \"after the death of the crescent\". Etymologically, lunar and spiritual \"po\" < \"pʰak\" < *\"phrâk\" 魄 are cognate with \"bai\" < \"bɐk\" < *\"brâk\" 白 \"white\" (Matisoff 1980, Yü 1981, Carr 1985). According to Hu Shih (1946:30), \"po\" etymologically means \"white, whiteness, and bright light\"; \"The primitive Chinese seem to have regarded the changing phases of the moon as periodic birth and death of its [\"po\"], its 'white light' or soul.\" Yü (1981:83) says this ancient association between the \"po\" soul and the \"growing light of the new moon is of tremendous importance to our understanding of certain myths related to the seventh day of the months.\" Two celebrated examples in Chinese mythology are Xi Wangmu and Emperor Wu meeting on the seventh day of the first lunar month and The Princess and the Cowherd or Qixi Festival held on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month.\n\nThe etymology of \"hun\" < \"γuən\" < *\"wûn\" 魂 is comparatively less certain. Hu (1946:31) said, \"The word \"hun\" is etymologically the same as the word \"yun\", meaning \"clouds.\" The clouds float about and seem more free and more active than the cold, white-lighted portion of the growing and waning moon.\" Schuessler cites two possibilities. Since \"pò\" is the 'bright' soul, \"hún\" is the 'dark' soul and therefore cognate to \"yún\" 雲 'cloud' [Carr 1985:62], perhaps in the sense of 'shadowy' because some believe that the \"hún\" soul will live after death in a world of shadows [Eberhard 1967:17]. (2007:290) \n\nThe correlative \"soul\" words \"hun\" 魂 and \"po\" 魄 have several meanings in Chinese plus many translations and explanations in English. The table below shows translation equivalents from some major Chinese-English dictionaries.\n\nBoth Chinese \"hun\" and \"po\" are translatable as English \"soul\" or \"spirit\", and both are basic components in \"soul\" compounds. In the following examples, all Chinese-English translation equivalents are from DeFrancis (2003).\n\n\n\"Hunpo\" and \"linghun\" are the most frequently used among these \"soul\" words.\n\nJoseph Needham and Lu Gwei-djen, eminent historians of science and technology in China, (1974:88) define \"hun\" and \"po\" in modern terms. \"Peering as far as one can into these ancient psycho-physiological ideas, one gains the impression that the distinction was something like that between what we would call motor and sensory activity on the one hand, and also voluntary as against vegetative processes on the other.\"\n\nFarzeen Baldrian-Hussein (2008:521) cautions about \"hun\" and \"po\" translations: \"Although the term \"souls\" is often used to refer to them, they are better seen as two types of vital entities, the source of life in every individual. The \"hun\" is Yang, luminous, and volatile, while the \"po\" is Yin, somber, and heavy.\"\n\nBased on \"Zuozhuan\" usages of \"hun\" and \"po\" in four historical contexts, Yü (1987:370) extrapolates that \"po\" was the original name for a human soul, and the dualistic conception of \"hun\" and \"po\" \"began to gain currency in the middle of the sixth century\" BCE.\n\nTwo earlier 6th century contexts used the \"po\" soul alone. Both describe \"Tian\" 天 \"heaven; god\" \"duo\" 奪 \"seizing; taking away\" a person's \"po\", which resulted in a loss of mental faculties. In 593 BCE (Duke Xuan 15th year, tr. Legge 1872:329), after Zhao Tong 趙同 behaved inappropriately at the Zhou court, an observer predicted: \"In less than ten years [Zhao Tong] will be sure to meet with great calamity. Heaven has taken his [魄] wits away from him.\" In 543 BCE (Duke Xiang 29th year, tr. Legge 1872:551), Boyou 伯有 from the state of Zheng acted irrationally, which an official interpreted as: \"Heaven is destroying [Boyou], and has taken away his [魄] reason.\" Boyou's political enemies subsequently arranged to take away his hereditary position and assassinate him.\n\nTwo later sixth-century \"Zuozhuan\" contexts used \"po\" together with the \"hun\" soul. In 534 BCE, the ghost of Boyou 伯有 (above) was seeking revenge on his murderers, and terrifying the people of Zheng. The philosopher and statesman Zi Chan, realizing that Boyou's loss of hereditary office had caused his spirit to be deprived of sacrifices, reinstated his son to the family position, and the ghost disappeared. When a friend asked Zi Chan to explain ghosts, he gave what Yu calls \"the \"locus classicus\" on the subject of the human soul in the Chinese tradition.\"\n\nCompare the translation of Needham and Lu, who interpret this as an early Chinese discourse on embryology. \nIn 516 BCE (Duke Zhao, Year 20), the Duke of Song and a guest named Shusun 叔孫 were both seen weeping during a supposedly joyful gathering. Yue Qi 樂祁, a Song court official, said:\n\"Hun\" and \"po\" souls, explains Yu (1987:371), \"are regarded as the very essence of the mind, the source of knowledge and intelligence. Death is thought to follow inevitably when the \"hun\" and the \"p'o\" leave the body. We have reason to believe that around this time the idea of \"hun\" was still relatively new.\"\n\nSoon after death, it was believed that a person's \"hun\" and \"po\" could be temporarily reunited through a ritual called the \"fu\" 復 \"recall; return\", \"zhaohun\" 招魂 \"summon the \"hun\" soul\", or \"zhaohun fupo\" 招魂復魄 \"to summon the \"hun\"-soul to reunite with the \"po\"-soul\". The earliest known account of this ritual is found in the (3rd century BCE) \"Chuci\" poems \"Zhao Hun\" 招魂 \"Summons of the Soul\" and \"Dazhao\" 大招 \"The Great Summons\". For example, the \"wu\" Yang () summons a man's soul in the \"Zhao Hun\".\n\nHu (1946:31–32) proposed, \"The idea of a \"hun\" may have been a contribution from the southern peoples\" (who originated \"Zhao Hun\" rituals) and then spread to the north sometime during the sixth century BCE. Calling this southern hypothesis \"quite possible\", Yu (1987:373) cites the \"Chuci\", associated with the southern state of Chu, demonstrating \"there can be little doubt that in the southern tradition the \"hun\" was regarded as a more active and vital soul than the \"p'o\". The \"Chuci\" uses \"hun\" 65 times and \"po\" 5 times (4 in \"hunpo\", which the \"Chuci\" uses interchangeably with \"hun\", Brashier 1996:131).\n\nThe identification of the \"yin-yang\" principle with the \"hun\" and \"po\" souls evidently occurred in the late fourth and early third centuries BCE (Yü 1987:374), and by \"the second century at the latest, the Chinese dualistic conception of soul had reached its definitive formulation.\" The \"Liji\" (11, tr. Legge 1885:444) compounds \"hun\" and \"po\" with \"qi\" \"breath; life force\" and \"xing\" \"form; shape; body\" in \"hunqi\" 魂氣 and \"xingpo\" 形魄. \"The [魂氣] intelligent spirit returns to heaven the [形魄] body and the animal soul return to the earth; and hence arose the idea of seeking (for the deceased) in sacrifice in the unseen darkness and in the bright region above.\" Compare this modern translation (Yü 1987:374), \"The breath-soul (\"hun-ch'I\" 魂氣) returns to heaven; the bodily soul (\"hsing-p'o\" 形魄) returns to earth. Therefore, in sacrificial-offering one should seek the meaning in the \"yin-yang\" 陰陽 principle.\" Yü summarizes \"hun\"/\"po\" dualism.\n\nLoewe (1979:9) explains with a candle metaphor; the physical \"xing\" is the \"wick and substance of a candle\", the spiritual \"po\" and \"hun\" are the \"force that keeps the candle alight\" and \"light that emanates from the candle\".\n\nThe Yin \"po\" and Yang \"hun\" were correlated with Chinese spiritual and medical beliefs. \"Hun\" 魂 is associated with \"shen\" 神 \"spirit; god\" and \"po\" 魄with \"gui\" 鬼 \"ghost; demon; devil\" (Carr 1985:62). The (ca. 1st century BCE) \"Lingshu Jing\" medical text spiritually applies Wu Xing \"Five Phase\" theory to the \"Zang-fu\" \"organs\", associating the \"hun\" soul with liver (Chinese medicine) and blood, and the \"po\" soul with lung (Chinese medicine) and breath.\n\nThe \"Lingshu Jing\" (Brashier 1996:142) also records that the \"hun\" and \"po\" souls taking flight can cause restless dreaming, and eye disorders can scatter the souls causing mental confusion. Han medical texts reveal that \"hun\" and \"po\" departing from the body does not necessarily cause death but rather distress and sickness. Brashier (1996:145–6) parallels the translation of \"hun\" and \"po\", \"If one were to put an English word to them, they are our 'wits', our ability to demarcate clearly, and like the English concept of \"wits,\" they can be scared out of us or can dissipate in old age.\"\nDuring the Han Dynasty, the belief in \"hun\" and \"po\" remained prominent, although there was a great diversity of different, sometimes contradictory, beliefs about the afterlife (Hansen 2000:119; Csikszentmihalyi 2006:116–117, 140–142). Han burial customs provided nourishment and comfort for the \"po\" with the placement of grave goods, including food, commodities, and even money within the tomb of the deceased (Hansen 2000:119). Chinese jade was believed to delay the decomposition of a body. Pieces of jade were commonly placed in bodily orifices, or rarely crafted into jade burial suits.\n\nGenerations of sinologists have repeatedly asserted that Han-era people commonly believed the heavenly \"hun\" and earthly \"po\" souls separated at death, but recent scholarship and archeology suggest that \"hunpo\" dualism was more an academic theory than a popular faith. Anna Seidel analyzed funerary texts discovered in Han tombs, which mention not only \"po\" souls but also \"hun\" remaining with entombed corpses, and wrote (1982:107), \"Indeed, a clear separation of a \"p'o\", appeased with the wealth included in the tomb, from a \"hun\" departed to heavenly realms is not possible.\" Seidel later (1987:227) called for reappraising Han abstract notions of \"hun\" and \"po\", which \"do not seem to have had as wide a currency as we assumed up to now.\" Pu Muzhou surveyed usages of the words \"hun\" and \"po\" on Han Dynasty \"bei\" 碑 \"stele\" erected at graves and shrines, and concluded (1993:216, tr. Brashier 1996126), \"The thinking of ordinary people seems to have been quite hazy on the matter of what distinguished the \"hun\" from the \"po\".\" These stele texts contrasted souls between a corporeal \"hun\" or \"hunpo\" at the cemetery and a spiritual \"shen\" at the family shrine. Kenneth Brashier (1996:158) reexamined the evidence for \"hunpo\" dualism and relegated it \"to the realm of scholasticism rather than general beliefs on death.\" Brashier (1996:136–137) cited several Han sources (grave deeds, \"Book of the Later Han\", and \"Jiaoshi Yilin\") attesting beliefs that \"the \"hun\" remains in the grave instead of flying up to heaven\", and suggested it \"was sealed into the grave to prevent its escape.\" Another Han text, the \"Fengsu Tongyi\" says, \"The vital energy of the \"hun\" of a dead person floats away; therefore a mask is made in order to retain it.\n\n\"Hun\" 魂 and \"po\" 魄 spiritual concepts were important in several Daoist traditions. For instance (Baldrian-Hussein 2008:522), \"Since the volatile \"hun\" is fond of wandering and leaving the body during sleep, techniques were devised to restrain it, one of which entailed a method of staying constantly awake.\"\n\nThe \"sanhunqipo\" 三魂七魄 \"three \"hun\" and seven \"po\"\" were anthropomorphized and visualized. Ge Hong's (ca. 320 CE) \"Baopuzi\" frequently mentions the \"hun\" and \"po\" \"ethereal and gross souls\". The \"Genii\" Chapter argues that these dual souls cause illness and death.\nAll men, wise or foolish, know that their bodies contain ethereal as well as gross breaths, and that when some of them quit the body, illness ensues; when they all leave him, a man dies. In the former case, the magicians have amulets for restraining them; in the latter case, \"The Rites\" [i.e., \"Yili\"] provide ceremonials for summoning them back. These breaths are most intimately bound up with us, for they are born when we are, but over a whole lifetime probably nobody actually hears or sees them. Would one conclude that they do not exist because they are neither seen nor heard? (2, tr. Ware 1966:49–50)\n\nThis \"magicians\" translates fangshi 方士 \"doctor; diviner' magician\". Both \"fangshi\" and \"daoshi\" 道士 \"Daoist priests\" developed methods and rituals to summon \"hun\" and \"po\" back into a person's body. The \"Gold and Cinnabar\" chapter records a Daoist alchemical reanimation pill that can return the \"hun\" and \"po\" souls to a recent corpse: \"Taiyi zhaohunpo dan fa\" 太乙招魂魄丹法 \"The Great One's Elixir Method for Summoning Souls\".\n\nIn T'ai-i's elixir for Summoning Gross and Ethereal Breaths the five minerals [i.e., cinnabar, realgar, arsenolite, malachite, and magnetite] are used and sealed with Six-One lute as in the Nine-crucible cinnabars. It is particularly effective for raising those who have died of a stroke. In cases where the corpse has been dead less than four days, force open the corpse's mouth and insert a pill of this elixir and one of sulphur, washing them down its gullet with water. The corpse will immediately come to life. In every case the resurrected remark that they have seen a messenger with a baton of authority summoning them. (4, tr. Ware 1966:87)\nFor visualizing the ten souls, the \"Baopuzi\" \"Truth on Earth\" chapter recommends taking \"dayao\" 大藥 \"great medicines\" and practicing a \"fenxing\" \"divide/multiply the body\" multilocation technique.\n\nMy teacher used to say that to preserve Unity was to practice jointly Bright Mirror, and that on becoming successful in the mirror procedure a man would be able to multiply his body to several dozen all with the same dress and facial expression. My teacher also used to say that you should take the great medicines diligently if you wished to enjoy Fullness of Life, and that you should use metal solutions and a multiplication of your person if you wished to communicate with the gods. By multiplying the body, the three \"Hun\" and the seven \"Po\" are automatically seen within the body, and in addition it becomes possible to meet and visit the powers of heaven and the deities of earth and to have all the gods of the mountains and rivers in one's service. (18, tr. Ware 1966:306)\n\nThe Daoist Shangqing School has several meditation techniques for visualizing the \"hun\" and \"po\". In Shangqing Neidan \"Internal Alchemy\", Baldrian-Hussein says,\nthe \"po\" plays a particularly somber role as it represents the passions that dominate the \"hun\". This causes the vital force to decay, especially during sexual activity, and eventually leads to death. The inner alchemical practice seeks to concentrate the vital forces within the body by reversing the respective roles of \"hun\" and \"po\", so that the \"hun\" (Yang) controls the \"po\" (Yin). (2008:533) \n\nThe number of human \"souls\" has been a long-standing source of controversy among Chinese religious traditions. Stevan Harrell (1979:521) concludes, \"Almost every number from one to a dozen has at one time or another been proposed as the correct one.\" The most commonly believed numbers of \"souls\" in a person are one, two, three, and ten.\n\nOne \"soul\" or \"linghun\" 靈魂 is the simplest idea. Harrell gives a fieldwork example.\nWhen rural Taiwanese perform ancestral sacrifices at home, they naturally think of the \"ling-hun\" in the tablet; when they take offerings to the cemetery, they think of it in the grave; and when they go on shamanistic trips, they think of it in the \"yin\" world. Because the contexts are separate, there is little conflict and little need for abstract reasoning about a nonexistent problem. (1979:523) \nTwo \"souls\" is a common folk belief, and reinforced by \"yin-yang\" theory. These paired souls can be called \"hun\" and \"po\", \"hunpo\" and \"shen\", or \"linghun\" and \"shen\".\n\nThree \"souls\" comes from widespread beliefs that the soul of a dead person can exist in the multiple locations. The missionary Justus Doolittle recorded that Chinese people in Fuzhou \nBelieve each person has \"three distinct\" souls while living. These souls separate at the death of the adult to whom they belong. One resides in the ancestral tablet erected to his memory, if the head of a family; another lurks in the coffin or the grave, and the third departs to the infernal regions to undergo its merited punishment. (1865 II:401–2) \n\nTen \"souls\" of \"sanhunqipo\" 三魂七魄 \"three \"hun\" and seven \"po\"\" is not only Daoist; \"Some authorities would maintain that the three-seven \"soul\" is basic to all Chinese religion\" (Harrell 1979:522). During the Later Han period, Daoists fixed the number of \"hun\" souls at three and the number of \"po\" souls at seven. A newly deceased person may return () to his home at some nights, sometimes one week () after his death and the seven po would disappear one by one every 7 days after death. According to Needham and Lu (1974:88), \"It is a little difficult to ascertain the reason for this, since fives and sixes (if they corresponded to the viscera) would have rather been expected.\" Three \"hun\" may stand for the \"sangang\" 三綱 \"three principles of social order: relationships between ruler-subject, father-child, and husband-wife\" (Needham 1974:89). Seven \"po\" may stand for the \"qiqiao\" 七竅 \"seven apertures (in the head, eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth)\" or the \"qiqing\" 七情 \"seven emotions (joy, anger, sorrow, fear, worry, grief, fright)\" in traditional Chinese medicine (Baldrian-Hussein 2008:522). Sanhunqipo also stand for other names.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54976874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54976874", "title": "Infectious tolerance", "text": "Infectious tolerance\n\nInfectious tolerance is a term referring to a phenomenon where a tolerance-inducing state is transferred from one cell population to another. It can be induced in many ways; although it is often artificially induced, it is a natural \"in vivo\" process. A number of research deal with the development of a strategy utilizing this phenomenon in transplantation immunology. The goal is to achieve long-term tolerance of the transplant through short-term therapy.\n\nThe term \"infectious tolerance\" was originally used by Gershon and Kondo in 1970 for suppression of naive lymphocyte populations by cells with regulatory function and for the ability to transfer a state of unresponsiveness from one animal to another. Gershon and Kondo discovered that T cells can not only amplify but also diminish immune responses. The T cell population causing this down-regulation was called suppressor T cells and was intensively studied for the following years (nowadays they are called regulatory T cells and are again a very attractive for research). These and other research in the 1970s showed greater complexity of immune regulation, unfortunately these experiments were largely disregarded, as methodological difficulties prevented clear evidence. Later developed new tolerogenic strategies have provided strong evidence to re-evaluate the phenomenon of T cell mediated suppression, in particular the use of non-depleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating that neither thymus nor clonal deletion is necessary to induce tolerance. In 1989 was successfully induced classical transplantation tolerance to skin grafts in adult mice using antibodies blocking T cell coreceptors in CD4+ populations. Later was shown that the effect of monoclonal antibodies is formation of regulatory T lymphocytes. It has been shown that transfer of tolerance to other recipients can be made without further manipulation and that this tolerance transfer depends only on CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Because second-generation tolerance arises in the absence of any monoclonal antibodies to CD4 or CD8, it probably represents a natural response of the immune system, which, once initiated, becomes self-sustaining. This ensures the long duration of once induced tolerance, for as long as the donor antigens are present.\n\nDuring a tolerant state potential effector cells remain but are tightly regulated by induced antigen-specific CD4+ regulatory T cells (iTregs). Many subsets of iTregs play a part in this proces, but CD4CD25FoxP3 Tregs play a key role, because they have the ability to convert conventional T cells into iTregs directly by secretion of the suppressive cytokines TGF-β, IL-10 or IL-35, or indirectly via dendritic cells (DCs). Production of IL-10 induces the formation of another population of regulatory T cells called Tr1. Tr1 cells are dependent on IL-10 and TGF-β as well as Tregs, but differ from them by lacking expression of Foxp3. High IL-10 production is characteristic for Tr1 cells themselves and they also produce TGF-β. In the presence of IL-10 can be also induced tolerogenic DCs from monocytes, whose production of IL-10 is also important for Tr1 formation. These interactions lead to the production of enzymes such as IDO (indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase) that catabolize essential amino acids. This microenvironment with a lack of essential amino acids together with other signals results in mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibition which, particularly in synergy with TGF-β, direct the induction of new FoxP3 (forkhead box protein 3) expressing Tregs.\n\n"}
{"id": "202835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202835", "title": "Jack Kevorkian", "text": "Jack Kevorkian\n\nJack Kevorkian (; May 26, 1928 – June 3, 2011) was an American pathologist and euthanasia proponent. He is best known for publicly championing a terminal patient's right to die via physician-assisted suicide; he claimed to have assisted at least 130 patients to that end. He was often portrayed in the media with the name of \"Dr. Death\". There was support for his cause, and he helped set the platform for reform. He said, \"Dying is not a crime\".\n\nIn 1999, Kevorkian was arrested and tried for his direct role in a case of voluntary euthanasia. He was convicted of second-degree murder and served eight years of a 10-to-25-year prison sentence. He was released on parole on June 1, 2007, on condition he would not offer advice nor participate nor be present in the act of any type of suicide involving euthanasia to any other person; as well as neither promote nor talk about the procedure of assisted suicide.\n\nKevorkian was born in Pontiac, Michigan, on May 26, 1928, to Armenian immigrants. His father, Levon, was born in the village of Passen, near Erzurum, and his mother, Satenig, was born in the village of Govdun, near Sivas. His father left Armenia in the Ottoman Empire and made his way to Pontiac in 1912, where he found work at an automobile foundry. Satenig fled the Armenian Genocide of 1915, finding refuge with relatives in Paris, and eventually reuniting with her brother in Pontiac. Levon and Satenig met through the Armenian community in their city, where they married and began their family. The couple had a daughter, Margaret, in 1926, followed by son Jack – and, their third and last child, Flora. \n\nKevorkian graduated from Pontiac Central High School with honors in 1945, at the age of 17. In 1952, he graduated from the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor.\n\nKevorkian completed residency training in anatomical and clinical pathology and briefly conducted research on blood transfusion.\n\nOver a period of decades, Kevorkian developed several controversial ideas related to death. In a 1959 journal article, he wrote:\n\nSenior doctors at the University of Michigan, Kevorkian's employer, opposed his proposal and Kevorkian chose to leave the University rather than stop advocating his ideas. Ultimately, he gained little support for his plan. He returned to the idea of using death row inmates for medical purposes after the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in \"Gregg v. Georgia\" re-instituted the death penalty. He advocated harvesting the organs from inmates after the death penalty was carried out for transplant into sick patients, but failed to gain the cooperation of prison officials.\n\nAs a pathologist at Pontiac General Hospital, Kevorkian experimented with transfusing blood from the recently deceased into live patients. He drew blood from corpses recently brought into the hospital and transferred it successfully into the bodies of hospital staff members. Kevorkian thought that the U.S. military might be interested in using this technique to help wounded soldiers during a battle, but the Pentagon was not interested.\n\nIn the 1980s, Kevorkian wrote a series of articles for the German journal \"Medicine and Law\" that laid out his thinking on the ethics of euthanasia.\n\nIn 1987, Kevorkian started advertising in Detroit newspapers as a physician consultant for \"death counseling\". His first public assisted suicide, of Janet Adkins, a 54-year-old woman diagnosed in 1989 with Alzheimer's disease, took place in 1990. Charges of murder were dropped on December 13, 1990, as there were, at that time, no laws in Michigan regarding assisted suicide. In 1991, however, the State of Michigan revoked Kevorkian's medical license and made it clear that given his actions, he was no longer permitted to practice medicine or to work with patients.\n\nAccording to his lawyer Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian assisted in the deaths of 130 terminally ill people between 1990 and 1998. In each of these cases, the individuals themselves allegedly took the final action which resulted in their own deaths. Kevorkian allegedly assisted only by attaching the individual to a euthanasia device that he had devised and constructed. The individual then pushed a button which released the drugs or chemicals that would end his or her own life. Two deaths were assisted by means of a device which delivered the euthanizing drugs intravenously. Kevorkian called the device a \"Thanatron\" (\"Death machine\", from the Greek \"thanatos\" meaning \"death\"). Other people were assisted by a device which employed a gas mask fed by a canister of carbon monoxide, which Kevorkian called the \"Mercitron\" (\"Mercy machine\"). \n\nAccording to a report by the \"Detroit Free Press\", 60% of the patients who died with Kevorkian's help were not terminally ill, and at least 13 had not complained of pain. The report further asserted that Kevorkian's counseling was too brief (with at least 19 patients dying less than 24 hours after first meeting Kevorkian) and lacked a psychiatric exam in at least 19 cases, 5 of which involved people with histories of depression, though Kevorkian was sometimes alerted that the patient was unhappy for reasons other than their medical condition. (In 1992, Kevorkian himself wrote that it is always necessary to consult a psychiatrist when performing assisted suicides because a person's \"mental state is ... of paramount importance.\") The report also stated that Kevorkian failed to refer at least 17 patients to a pain specialist after they complained of chronic pain, and sometimes failed to obtain a complete medical record for his patients, with at least three autopsies of suicides Kevorkian had assisted with showing the person who committed suicide to have no physical sign of disease. Rebecca Badger, a patient of Kevorkian's and a mentally troubled drug abuser, had been mistakenly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The report also stated that Janet Adkins, Kevorkian's first euthanasia patient, had been chosen without Kevorkian ever speaking to her, only with her husband, and that when Kevorkian first met Adkins two days before her assisted suicide he \"made no real effort to discover whether Ms. Adkins wished to end her life,\" as the Michigan Court of Appeals put it in a 1995 ruling upholding an order against Kevorkian's activity. According to \"The Economist\": \"Studies of those who sought out Dr. Kevorkian, however, suggest that though many had a worsening illness ... it was not usually terminal. Autopsies showed five people had no disease at all. ... Little over a third were in pain. Some presumably suffered from no more than hypochondria or depression.\"\n\nIn response, Kevorkian's attorney Geoffrey Fieger published an essay stating, \"I've never met any doctor who lived by such exacting guidelines as Kevorkian ... he published them in an article for the American Journal of Forensic Psychiatry in 1992. Last year he got a committee of doctors, the Physicians of Mercy, to lay down new guidelines, which he scrupulously follows.\" However, Fieger stated that Kevorkian found it difficult to follow his \"exacting guidelines\" because of \"persecution and prosecution\", adding \"[H]e's proposed these guidelines saying this is what ought to be done. These are not to be done in times of war, and we're at war.\"\n\nIn a 2010 interview with Sanjay Gupta, Kevorkian stated an objection to the status of assisted suicide in Oregon, Washington, and Montana. At that time, only in those three states was assisted suicide legal in the United States, and then only for terminally ill patients. To Gupta, Kevorkian stated, \"What difference does it make if someone is terminal? We are all terminal.\" In his view, a patient did not have to be terminally ill to be assisted in committing suicide, but needed to be suffering. However, he also said in that same interview that he declined four out of every five assisted suicide requests, on the grounds that the patient needed more treatment or medical records had to be checked.\n\nIn 2011, disability rights and anti-legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia group Not Dead Yet spoke out against Kevorkian, citing potentially concerning sentiments he expressed in his published writing. For instance, on page 214 of \"Prescription: Medicide, the Goodness of Planned Death\", Kevorkian wrote that assisting \"suffering or doomed persons kill themselves\" was \"merely the first step, an early distasteful professional obligation ... What I find most satisfying is the prospect of making possible the performance of invaluable experiments or other beneficial medical acts under conditions that this first unpleasant step can help establish – in a word obitiatry.\" In a journal article, \"The last fearsome taboo: Medical aspects of planned death\", Kevorkian also detailed anesthetizing, experimenting on, and utilizing the organs of a disabled newborn as a token of \"daring and highly imaginative research\" that would be possible \"beyond the constraints of traditional but outmoded, hopelessly inadequate, and essentially irrelevant ethical codes now sustained for the most part by vacuous sentimental reverence.\"\n\nKevorkian was a jazz musician and composer. \"The Kevorkian Suite: A Very Still Life\" was a 1997 limited-release CD of 5,000 copies from the 'Lucid Subjazz' label. It features Kevorkian on the flute and organ playing his own works with \"The Morpheus Quintet\". It was reviewed in \"Entertainment Weekly\" online as \"weird\" but \"good-natured\". As of 1997, 1,400 units had been sold. Kevorkian wrote all the songs but one; the album was reviewed in \"jazzreview.com\" as \"very much grooviness\" except for one tune, with \"stuff in between that's worthy of multiple spins.\"\n\nThe first public performance of the complete classical organ works by Jack Kevorkian was by Craig Rifel in a live concert on January 30, 1996 at Central United Methodist Church in Waterford, Michigan, including Kevorkian's Prelude & Fugue in E-flat, Pipe Dream, Sonata in D, Passacaglia on B-A-C-H, Pastorale & Fugue in B-Flat, and Fantasy & Fugue in C.\n\nHe was also an oil painter. His work tended toward the grotesque and surreal, and he had created pieces of symbolic art, such as one \"of a child eating the flesh off a decomposing corpse.\" Of his known works, six were made available in the 1990s for print release. The Ariana Gallery in Royal Oak, Michigan, is the exclusive distributor of Kevorkian's artwork. The original oil prints are not for release. Sludge metal band Acid Bath used his painting \"For He is Raised\" as the cover art for their 1996 album \"Paegan Terrorism Tactics\".\n\nIn 2011, his paintings became the center of a legal entanglement between his sole heir and a Massachusetts museum.\n\nKevorkian was tried four times for assisting suicides between May 1994 and June 1997. With the assistance of Fieger, Kevorkian was acquitted three times. The fourth trial ended in a mistrial. The trials helped Kevorkian gain public support for his cause. After Oakland County prosecutor Richard Thompson lost a primary election to a Republican challenger, Thompson attributed the loss in part to the declining public support for the prosecution of Kevorkian and its associated legal expenses.\n\nOn November 22, 1998, broadcast of CBS News' \"60 Minutes\", Kevorkian allowed the airing of a videotape he made on September 17, 1998, which depicted the voluntary euthanasia of Thomas Youk, 52, who was in the final stages of Lou Gehrig's disease. After Youk provided his fully informed consent (a sometimes complex legal determination made in this case by editorial consensus) on September 17, 1998, Kevorkian himself administered Thomas Youk a lethal injection. This was highly significant, as all of his earlier clients had reportedly completed the process themselves. During the videotape, Kevorkian dared the authorities to try to convict him or stop him from carrying out mercy killings. Youk's family described the lethal injection as humane, not murder.\n\nOn March 26, 1999, Kevorkian was charged with second-degree murder and the delivery of a controlled substance (administering the lethal injection to Thomas Youk). Because Kevorkian's license to practice medicine had been revoked eight years previously, he was not legally allowed to possess the controlled substance. As homicide law is relatively fixed and routine, this trial was markedly different from earlier ones that involved an area of law in flux (assisted suicide). Kevorkian discharged his attorneys and proceeded through the trial representing himself, a decision he later regretted. The judge ordered a criminal defense attorney to remain available at trial as standby counsel for information and advice. Inexperienced in law but persisting in his efforts to represent himself, Kevorkian encountered great difficulty in presenting his evidence and arguments. He was not able to call any witnesses to the stand as the judge did not deem the testimony of any of his witnesses relevant.\n\nAfter a two-day trial, the Michigan jury found Kevorkian guilty of second-degree homicide. Judge Jessica Cooper sentenced Kevorkian to serve 10–25 years in prison and told him:\n\nThis is a court of law and you said you invited yourself here to take a final stand. But this trial was not an opportunity for a referendum. The law prohibiting euthanasia was specifically reviewed and clarified by the Michigan Supreme Court several years ago in a decision involving your very own cases, sir. So the charge here should come as no surprise to you. You invited yourself to the wrong forum. Well, we are a nation of laws, and we are a nation that tolerates differences of opinion because we have a civilized and a nonviolent way of resolving our conflicts that weighs the law and adheres to the law. We have the means and the methods to protest the laws with which we disagree. You can criticize the law, you can write or lecture about the law, you can speak to the media or petition the voters.\n\nKevorkian was sent to a prison in Coldwater, Michigan, to serve his sentence. After his conviction (and subsequent losses on appeal), Kevorkian was denied parole repeatedly until 2007.\n\nIn an MSNBC interview aired on September 29, 2005, Kevorkian said that if he were granted parole, he would not resume directly helping people die and would restrict himself to campaigning to have the law changed. On December 22, 2005, Kevorkian was denied parole by a board on the count of 7–2 recommending not to give parole.\n\nReportedly terminally ill with Hepatitis C, which he contracted while doing research on blood transfusions in the 1960s, Kevorkian was expected to die within a year in May 2006. After applying for a pardon, parole, or commutation by the parole board and Governor Jennifer Granholm, he was paroled for good behavior on June 1, 2007. He had spent eight years and two and a half months in prison.\n\nKevorkian was on parole for two years, under the conditions that he would not help anyone else die, or provide care for anyone older than 62 or disabled. Kevorkian said he would abstain from assisting any more terminal patients with death, and his role in the matter would strictly be to persuade states to change their laws on assisted suicide. He was also forbidden by the rules of his parole from commenting about assisted suicide.\n\nKevorkian gave a number of lectures upon his release. He lectured at universities such as the University of Florida, Nova Southeastern University, and the University of California, Los Angeles. His lectures were not limited to the topic of euthanasia; he also discussed such topics as tyranny, the criminal justice system, politics, the Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Armenian culture. He appeared on Fox News Channel's \"Your World with Neil Cavuto\" on September 2, 2009, to discuss health care reform.\n\nOn April 15 and 16, 2010, Kevorkian appeared on CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360°\", Cooper asked, \"You are saying doctors play God all the time?\" Kevorkian said: \"Of course. Anytime you interfere with a natural process, you are playing God.\"\nDirector Barry Levinson and actors Susan Sarandon and John Goodman, who appeared in \"You Don't Know Jack\", a film based on Kevorkian's life, were interviewed alongside Kevorkian. Kevorkian was again interviewed by Cavuto on \"Your World\" on April 19, 2010 regarding the movie and Kevorkian's world view. \"You Don't Know Jack\" premiered April 24, 2010 on HBO. The film premiered April 14 at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City. Kevorkian walked the red carpet alongside Al Pacino, who portrayed him in the film. Pacino received Emmy and Golden Globe awards for his portrayal, and personally thanked Kevorkian, who was in the audience, upon receiving both of these awards. Kevorkian stated that both the film and Pacino's performance \"brings tears to my eyes – and I lived through it\".\n\nOn March 12, 2008, Kevorkian announced plans to run for United States Congress to represent Michigan's 9th congressional district as an independent against eight-term congressman Joe Knollenberg (R-Bloomfield Hills), former Michigan Lottery commissioner and state senator Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township), Adam Goodman (L-Royal Oak) and Douglas Campbell (G-Ferndale). The race had already garnered national attention due to Democrats targeting the historically Republican district based in Oakland County, which Knollenberg barely won in 2006 against a little-known opponent, and which would suffer some of the worst brunt of the Great Recession due to declines in Detroit's automotive industry. Upon Kevorkian's entry into the race, one analyst viewed Kevorkian as a potential spoiler to Peters' candidacy.\n\nUltimately, Kevorkian received 8,987 votes (2.6% of the vote) in the election, in which Peters defeated the incumbent Knollenberg by a nine-percent margin. Peters would eventually serve three terms in Congress before making a successful run for the United States Senate.\n\nKevorkian taught himself the German and Japanese languages.\n\nKevorkian had struggled with kidney problems for years. He was diagnosed with liver cancer, which \"may have been caused by hepatitis C,\" according to his longtime friend Neal Nicol. Kevorkian was hospitalized on May 18, 2011, with kidney problems and pneumonia. Kevorkian's condition grew rapidly worse and he died from a thrombosis on June 3, 2011, eight days after his 83rd birthday, at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan. According to his attorney, Mayer Morganroth, there were no artificial attempts to keep him alive and his death was painless. Kevorkian was buried in White Chapel Memorial Park Cemetery in Troy, Michigan.\n\nJudge Thomas Jackson, who presided over Kevorkian's first murder trial in 1994, commented that he wanted to express sorrow at Kevorkian's death and that the 1994 case was brought under \"a badly written law\" aimed at Kevorkian, but he attempted to give him \"the best trial possible.\" Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's lawyer during the 1990s, gave a speech at a press conference in which he stated: \"Dr. Jack Kevorkian didn't seek out history, but he made history.\" Fieger said that Kevorkian revolutionized the concept of suicide by working to help people end their own suffering, because he believed physicians are responsible for alleviating the suffering of patients, even if that meant allowing patients to die. John Finn, medical director of palliative care at the Catholic St. John's Hospital, said Kevorkian's methods were unorthodox and inappropriate. He added that many of Kevorkian's patients were isolated, lonely, and potentially depressed, and therefore in no state to mindfully choose whether to live or die. Derek Humphry, author of the suicide handbook \"Final Exit\", said Kevorkian was \"too obsessed, too fanatical, in his interest in death and suicide to offer direction for the nation.\" In a 2015 Retro Report story about Kevorkian's legacy and the Right to Die movement, journalist Jack Lessenberry said Kevorkian \"got a national debate going, which I think he then helped stifle by his own outrageous actions.\" Howard Markel, a medical historian at the University of Michigan, said that Kevorkian \"was a major historical figure in modern medicine.\" The Catholic Church in Detroit said Kevorkian left behind a \"deadly legacy\" that denied scores of people their right to humane deaths. Philip Nitschke, founder and director of right-to-die organization Exit International, said that Kevorkian \"moved the debate forward in ways the rest of us can only imagine. He started at a time when it was hardly talked about and got people thinking about the issue. He paid one hell of a price, and that is one of the hallmarks of true heroism.\"\n\nThe epitaph on Kevorkian's tombstone reads, \"He sacrificed himself for everyone's rights.\"\n\nBooks\n\nSelected journal articles\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12594600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12594600", "title": "Jason Macendale", "text": "Jason Macendale\n\nJason Philip Macendale, Jr. is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nThe character first appears in \"Machine Man\" #19 (Feb 1981), created by writer Tom DeFalco and artist Steve Ditko. In \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #289 (June 1987) he switches identities from Jack O'Lantern to the Hobgoblin.\n\nThe character was killed off in \"Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives\" #1 in order to make room for Roderick Kingsley to assume the Hobgoblin mantle. Writer Roger Stern recounted that he was initially uncertain of how to resolve the situation of there being two Hobgoblins: \n\nJason Philip Macendale was a former CIA agent who was recruited out of college to become an agent for the organization. Macendale proved to be a liability to the organization, due to his violent nature and amoral personality. This rejection turned Macendale to become a mercenary and ultimately a costumed terrorist, as he adopted the costumed alter ego of Jack O'Lantern.\n\nJack O'Lantern became a regular nemesis for Spider-Man, meeting him in battle the first time in \"Spectacular Spider-Man\" #56. He was later hired to retrieve the Hobgoblin's lost battle van and despite the untimely appearance of Spider-Man, pulled off the mission successfully.\n\nWishing to increase his underworld status, Macendale formed an alliance with the Hobgoblin, who at this time was using brainwashed journalist Ned Leeds as a proxy. The brainwashing treatments used on Ned Leeds to make him Hobgoblin began to affect his sanity, ultimately leading to him doublecrossing Macendale when the two were fleeing a horde of police officers. Macendale vowed revenge against Ned Leeds, ultimately hiring the Foreigner to have him killed. Upon killing Leeds, all known copies of the Hobgoblin's weapons and costumes were handed over to Macendale, who took over the identity in order to steal Ned's notoriety within the supervillain community.\n\nMacendale's scheme was foiled; he was exposed as the new Hobgoblin, and lost a battle against Spider-Man which was meant to prove his ability. Deciding he needed the original Hobgoblin's powers if he was to match his reputation, Macendale attempted to steal the Green Goblin's secret formula for superhuman strength, resulting in a confrontation between himself and Harry Osborn, the second Green Goblin. Green Goblin overcame the Hobgoblin.\n\nDejected and humiliated, Macendale offered to sell his soul to N'astirh, a demon leading an invasion of Manhattan, in exchange for the power of a demon. N'astirh fused a demon to Macendale. Enhanced by the demon's power, but horrified to see his once handsome face transformed into a demonic one, Macendale blamed his suffering on Spider-Man and hunted him down for revenge. With his new demonic powers, he defeated Spider-Man easily, but Mary Jane Watson intervened before he could deliver the killing blow.\n\nMacendale put aside his personal enmity for Spider-Man, and used his new demonic powers to become a top contract killer. As an independent mercenary and criminal, Macendale would clash with many other heroes, including Ghost Rider, Sleepwalker, Doctor Strange, and Darkhawk. He would also join two reformed incarnations of the Sinister Six.\n\nEventually, Macendale's personality was overcome by the insane demon who shared his body, and he began to consider himself an agent of God sent to Earth to kill sinners. This led him into conflict with Ghost Riders Danny Ketch and Johnny Blaze and Spider-Man; during the battle, a blast from Johnny Blaze's \"Hellfire Shotgun\" destabilized the demon within Macendale, long enough for him to briefly regain his sanity.\n\nDuring a fight between Macendale, Spider-Man, Moon Knight, and Doctor Strange, the heroes realized that Macendale's insanity was partly caused by despair over losing his handsome face. To try to calm the monstrous man/demon, Doctor Strange agreed to cast an illusion spell upon Macendale that caused Macendale to see his true face in reflections of himself. This helped Macendale enough that he was ultimately able to expel the demon from within himself, with the demon referring to itself as the Demogoblin. As Hobgoblin, Macendale was stiff-armed by Doctor Octopus into joining the 2nd incarnation of the group the Sinister Six, which twice tried to take over the world, failing due to counter measures by Spider-Man, the Hulk, Ghost Rider, the Fantastic Four, and many more heroes. In a rare event, Macendale teamed up with Spider-Man to defeat the duo of Demogoblin and Doppelganger.\n\nNext the Hobgoblin was hired by the Foreigner to assassinate Moon Knight and Nick Katzenberg, only to be stopped by Moon Knight and Spider-Man. Spider-Man turned him over to the authorities.\n\nMacendale obtained the strength formula of Kraven the Hunter, which enabled him to easily defeat his demonic doppelganger, Demogoblin, who then died saving a young child in battle.\n\nMacendale was defeated once more by Spider-Man along with Coldheart, during an attempt to kidnap Macendale's long-lost son. However, Macendale's reunion would be an unhappy one as Macendale attempted (unsuccessfully) to use his son as a hostage to avoid going back to jail. He would remain in jail for some time before being freed by Gaunt, sending him into combat against the new Spider-Man, Ben Reilly. In exchange for doing Gaunt's bidding, the scientist turned Macendale into a cyborg, complete with removal of one of Macendale's eyes with a new high-tech cybernetic eye. He failed however and was once again arrested.\n\nJason Macendale went on trial for his many crimes. Found guilty on several counts, including convictions for acts caused by both the Roderick and Leeds Hobgoblins, a disgusted Macendale responded by revealing that Ned Leeds \"was\" Hobgoblin. Roderick Kingsley, fearful that Macendale's continued testimony could expose him as the original Hobgoblin, broke into prison and murdered Macendale.\n\nA bank robbing Jack O'Lantern initially misidentified as Macendale is captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. in \"Secret War\". This individual was using several false aliases including Jason Macendale, Maguire Beck (Mysterio's cousin), and Mad Jack (Daniel Berkhart). The true identify of this Jack O'Lantern was never revealed but it was not any of the aliases he was using.\n\nMacendale originally possessed no superhuman powers, but used similar paraphernalia to the Hobgoblin and Green Goblin; in both his Jack O'Lantern and Hobgoblin persona he used a rocket-powered glider, pumpkin bombs, and gauntlet blasters.\n\nDuring the time in which a demon was grafted to him, he had superhuman strength, speed, and agility, as well as hellfire powers enabling him to create weapons and gliders at will. In one story it is implied that his demonic abilities allowed him to create organic fibers strong enough to bind a normal person.\n\nAfter Macendale acquired the formula of Kraven the Hunter, he had enhanced his strength, speed, stamina, durability, reflexes, and agility to superhuman levels which were greater than Kraven's, thanks to anomalies in his blood left over when he and Demogoblin were one, but the formula's effects seemed to have later wore off like it would with Kraven. His later cybernetically enhanced body further increased his strength, speed, reflexes, durability, and stamina.\n\nMacendale had extensive military training in hand-to-hand combat, martial arts, espionage, and knowledge of conventional weaponry. He often used conventional military weapons. When he adopted the Hobgoblin persona, he was able to make improvements to the maneuverability of the goblin glider by utilizing skills he gained from his master's degrees in both mechanical engineering and physics.\n\nMacendale was a sociopath and a sadist, which led to his dishonorable discharge from the military.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4428615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4428615", "title": "John Cavil", "text": "John Cavil\n\nJohn Cavil (Number One) is a fictional character and the main antagonist from the re-imagined \"Battlestar Galactica\" television series. He is portrayed by Dean Stockwell. In the fourth-season episode \"Six of One\", Cavil's model number was revealed as Number One.\n\nJohn Cavil, aka Number One, is a humanoid Cylon model that appears as a highly rational, eccentric man in his late-sixties. The Cavils have a heavy sarcastic demeanor and a sense of humor. They take neither religion nor death seriously and are the only atheist Cylon model. A Cavil is first seen aboard the Galactica assuming the role of a priest, offering spiritual guidance, and going by the name \"Brother Cavil\".\n\nOne of the unique characteristics of the Cavils is the sadistic, cruel and Machiavellian streak in their personalities. The Cavils openly mock their fellow Cylons every time they attempt contact with humans, even when it is absolutely necessary.\n\nEven though they view death as only a nuisance, the Cavils are extremely displeased with pain (placing the blame on the Final Five). This view fuels the idea that the Cavils wanted death to the humans to be as quick as possible, but were unprepared for the aftermath. Their attitude towards mankind's mortality, rather than irrational hatred, derives from their overall lack of knowledge about absolute death and the consequences that it carries. As revealed on \"\", the Cavil that was stationed in Caprica learns from Samuel Anders the motives for the resistance; that humans do not leave anyone behind, even their dead. Respecting their resilience, the \"Caprica\" Cavil agrees with Caprica Six and Sharon Valerii (Boomer) to abandon the Colonies. Disappointed with the other Cylon models after failing to accomplish anything through boycott and sabotage, the \"Galactica\" Cavil fails to learn any lesson. As they are discovered and airlocked from Galactica, \"Galactica\" Cavil swears to \"box\" \"Caprica\" Cavil for his insubordination and is indicated to be the same Cavil that is the main enemy of season four given his plans to destroy humanity once and for all once he resurrects.\n\nIt is later implied in the series that the Cavils, akin to their creators, lack superhuman strength, and are actually the least likely to defend themselves. It is also implied that the Cavil who led the Civil War, and who killed himself in the CIC when he realized he was losing and had no chance of winning, is the resurrected \"Galactica\" Cavil. Like the Simons and Number Threes, and in contrast to Leobens, Dorals, Number Sixes, and Number Eights, Cavils appear to be relatively uncommon and seldom appear in large groups, though in the third-season episode \"Rapture\" a large number were seen presumably taking care of the boxing of the three line of Cylons.\n\nThe Cavils' superior awareness of all situations (attributable to their being the only human model Cylon with full knowledge of their origin) and uncanny manipulative traits make their series the de facto leaders of the Cylons. However, their vast superiority and manipulations over their fellow Cylons goes beyond comprehension, as they manage to annihilate the Twelve Colonies and repeatedly attack the survivors without hurting the Final Five, and ensure their survival only to make them 'the ones who suffer the most', and basically carrying on with the annihilation of billions only to teach their creators a lesson.\n\nA comment made by Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii indicates the Cavils are against the idea of the Cylons reproducing themselves biologically, which makes sense given their distaste for human traits as well as lack of faith in the Cylon god, whose commandments include, \"Be fruitful.\" Ellen Tigh also mentions that the idea that the only hope for the future of the Cylon race might be 'messy biological reproduction' is too much for Cavil.\n\nCavil is very insistent the Cylons not seek out or discuss the Final Five models. He also actively tries to prevent D'Anna from learning their identities, even threatening her at gunpoint in \"Rapture\". After she sees their faces, he boxes her before she can tell anyone, while claiming support from the other Cylons. The reason is he knows the identities of the Final Five and doesn't want them exposed (he’s waiting until they've learned their \"lesson.\")\n\nTwo versions of Cavil appear at the end of the second season – in the two-part episode \"Lay Down Your Burdens.\" His first appearance is as a religious counselor provided by the fleet, with whom Chief Tyrol meets after he physically attacks deck hand Cally Henderson when she awakens him from a recurring nightmare. Tyrol states he dreams of killing himself, and Cavil suggests Tyrol subconsciously believes he is a Cylon sleeper agent like his former girlfriend Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii.\n\nCavil assures Tyrol he is no Cylon, joking \"I've never seen you at any of the [Cylon] meetings.\" Despite posing as a priest, Cavil is critical of the Lords of Kobol, telling Tyrol praying to them will not help. Cavil states humans have been given the choice to decide their own destinies, and the Lords play no part in their affairs. Cavil later meets with President Laura Roslin, and offers prayers to the Lords of Kobol for Roslin's success in her presidential campaign against Gaius Baltar.\n\nA second version of Cavil appears among the survivors from Caprica after Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace leads a rescue mission to the planet. During a Cylon attack, the Cylons suddenly cease fire and withdraw. The Cavil among the group announces the Cylons have left Caprica, and that the group has been spared. Upon their return to the fleet, Chief Tyrol spots the second Cavil disembarking from a Raptor, and alerts the guards he is a Cylon. \"Caprica\" Cavil admits to being a Cylon with a message for their leader. Admiral Adama has the man taken to the brig. Meanwhile, \"Galactica\" Cavil is arrested, and emphatically protests his innocence until he sees another copy of himself in the brig. He simply says \"Oh, well...okay then,\" and calmly enters the cell.\n\nCaprica Cavil gives a message to Roslin, stating the Cylon attack on the Colonies, as well as pursuit of the fleet, was an error. Cavil further explains two Cylon heroes, the Number Six model known as Caprica Six and Number Eight (that version of Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii that was stationed on \"Galactica\" and shot Admiral Adama), have convinced them the war is futile. He states though the Cylons are machines, they strive to be the best machines possible, and believe they will one day rise above their creators. Their first step had been to replace the humans, and they believed they could do this by hijacking their lives and taking their places. They have determined, however, they have become no better than the creators they despise, and offer a reprieve from the genocide, suggesting that human and Cylon go their separate ways.\n\nAdama and Roslin furiously reject the idea, stating they simply cannot walk away after the Cylons have destroyed their home worlds. Adama asks the two Cavils whether the new plan comes from their God, and Cavil says \"there is no God. Supernatural divinities are the primitive's answer to why the sun goes down at night...or at least that's what we've been telling the others for years,\" although he acknowledges neither position can be proven. Despite the apparent sincerity of the message, and the offer of truce, Roslin orders both Cavils to be airlocked, suggesting they will rapidly discover whether or not God exists. The actual disposal through the airlock is not shown on screen, but is shown in the film \"The Plan\". \"Galactica\" Cavil reveals that there is a Resurrection Ship nearby and, given his comments, his resurrected self is likely the one that leads the Civil War.\n\nAt least two Cavil versions are present on New Caprica during the Cylon occupation. The New Caprica Cavils display particularly venomous anti-human sentiments, taking great pleasure in taunting human prisoners and shrugging off the human casualties of insurgent suicide bombings. One Cavil in particular takes pleasure in blackmailing Ellen Tigh for sexual favors in exchange for releasing her husband Saul from captivity and not killing him. Saul Tigh is eventually released, having lost his right eye.\n\nLater in the season, Cavil is one of three Cylons to board \"Galactica\" to meet with William Adama and Laura Roslin about the Eye of Jupiter artifiact. He is willing to hand Gaius Baltar over to the humans as part of a deal for the relic, \"to sweeten the pot.\" Upon returning to his Basestar, Cavil feels that the annihilation of \"Galactica\" is the best option, given the standoff, because Cylons are machines, and can wait out the human fleet.\n\nIn \"Rapture, Cavil finds D'Anna in the temple on the Algae Planet, and, realizing she has come to discover the identities of the Final Five, he orders her at gunpoint not to proceed any further. However, Baltar shoots him from behind, and D'Anna finally sees their faces, but she loses consciousness and dies shortly thereafter.\n\nCavil is present as D'Anna resurrects. He states all members of her line, the Number Threes are fundamentally flawed, and suffer from messianic delusions. He claims he and the other Cylon models agree the Number Threes must all be \"boxed\" – deactivated, with their memories placed into cold storage. The boxing is carried out by Cavil.\n\nCavil takes a major role in Season Four, as the leader and head negotiator of one of the two warring Cylon factions. In \"Six of One,\" Natalie, the leader of the opposing faction, demands he stop lobotomizing the Raiders, and reveals that she has restored free will to the Centurions. The Centurions then slaughter Cavil and the other Cylons in the room.\n\nCavil resurrects in \"The Ties That Bind,\" and claims that, although he does not agree with Natalie and her followers, he will respect their wishes. The Number Twos, Number Sixes and Number Eights (except Boomer) demand the Threes be unboxed to end the deadlock. Cavil seemingly acquiesces but, in reality, sets a trap to destroy Natalie and her followers. Boomer starts to have second thoughts about going against her fellow Eights. However, Cavil, who has developed a relationship with her, encourages her to embrace her true nature as a machine, and abandon her emotions.\n\nNatalie survives the attack, and a civil war ensues. D'Anna is unboxed by Cavil in \"The Hub\". Cavil hopes she will be able to mediate peace between the warring Cylon factions, but she kills him and escapes with Helo and a Number Eight.\n\nIn \"No Exit\", it is revealed Ellen Tigh was involved in the creation of Cavil, modelling him after the image of her own father, John. Cavil was the first of a new generation of Cylons, and he assisted in the creation of models Two to Eight. Because Ellen Tigh favored the Number Seven (Daniel) model, Cavil's jealousy grew and he had the entire line destroyed by tampering with the amniotic fluid housing the Daniel copies. Cavil was also responsible for the Final Five being banished to live as humans. His rage fueled in part by the Final Five condemning him to an existence complete with all of humanity's weaknesses, and realizing the Five would try to avert another war against the humans, he killed them and when they resurrected, he erased their memories and left them among the humans so they could witness the eventual genocide of the human race. Cavil manipulated his \"parents\", the Final Five, to be among those who suffered the most.\n\nIt was also speculated (although never explicitly stated) Cavil was the one who programmed models Two to Eight to not seek out or discuss the Final Five. This theory has been confirmed in an interview with writer Ryan Mottesheard:\n\n\"John/Cavil is the only one who knows the Final Five because he corrupted the programming of the other six models to never speak of the Final Five or search for their identities. Obviously, if they did, then his little house of cards topples, which is why he boxed D’Anna.\"\nAfter Ellen Tigh is poisoned by her husband, she resurrects aboard one of Cavil's ships and is held prisoner there for 18 months (No Exit). In the process of downloading to a new body, Ellen regains the memories Cavil had erased. Later, when the Cylons' resurrection capability is destroyed, Cavil attempts to acquire Ellen's knowledge of the technology (she and the other Final Five being the ones who developed the ability to resurrect). Cavil plans to kill Ellen and recover the information from her brain. Boomer seemingly rebels against him and helps Ellen escape. It is later revealed, however, Ellen's escape was orchestrated by Cavil to sneak Boomer onto \"Galactica\" in order to kidnap Hera Agathon.\n\nIt is stated by Ellen in No Exit that Cavil is a sadist who enjoys playing mind games with the Final Five as evidenced by him taking Galen Tyrol's confession, a copy following Sam Anders in the resistance, torturing Tigh on New Caprica as well as extorting Ellen for sexual favors. He is also responsible for her being placed on a ship as it was leaving a destroyed Colony as part of his manipulations of the Final Five.\n\nCavil fully embraces his identity as a machine and believes humans are inherently lesser than Cylons, dismissing Ellen's arguments that humans, for all their imperfections, have something real and precious: Love, compassion, creativity, emotion.\n\nThe character of Cavil has echoes of the story of Oedipus. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger sees Cavil as \"a cruel hybrid of the Biblical Cain (he murdered his brother, and his mother is fond of apples), Oedipus (has sex with his mother, though the eye he puts out belongs to his father) and a kind of Pinocchio in reverse.\"\n\nCavil wants Hera, as he sees her as the only chance for the Cylon race to continue, following the destruction of Resurrection. After Boomer helps Hera escape, Cavil personally leads a boarding party onto \"Galactica\" to retrieve her. In \"Galactica\"'s CIC, Cavil is captured, while a Simon and Doral with him are killed by the bridge crew. Cavil takes advantage of an explosion to take a gun from a Colonial Marine guard, after knocking him down, and takes Hera hostage. Baltar lowers his side arm, and tries to convince Cavil to end the cycle of violence, and end the standoff on the bridge; Cavil begins to waver from Baltar's speech, but he refuses – without Hera, he believes his race will end.\n\nTigh offers Cavil Resurrection technology if he releases Hera and stops pursuing humanity. Cavil agrees, and calls off his troops, saying he's a man of his word. Cavil becomes impatient, and sarcastically tells the Final Five Cylons to \"hurry up\" their discussions, as they are \"keeping two civilizations waiting.\" As the Final Five come together to generate the data necessary for Resurrection technology, Tyrol, discovering Tory was responsible for the death of his wife Cally, breaks the link and kills her. Cavil realizes that, since each of the Final Five possessed part of the secret to Resurrection, that in killing one, then the secret of Resurrection has effectively been lost with the death of Tory.\n\nAt that very moment, the Cylon Colony is hit by a barrage of \"Galactica\"'s remaining nuclear warheads fired by Racetrack's Raptor, which knocks the Colony out of orbit, and dooms it to be swallowed by the black hole. The surviving Simon and Doral, deciding the whole process has been a trick, recommence the battle with the humans, and are gunned down. Cavil shouts \"Frak!\", puts his gun into his mouth, and commits suicide.\n\n"}
{"id": "1784196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1784196", "title": "Laotian rock rat", "text": "Laotian rock rat\n\nThe Laotian rock rat or kha-nyou (Latin: \"Laonastes aenigmamus\", Lao: ຂະຍຸ), sometimes called the \"rat-squirrel\", is a rodent species of the Khammouan region of Laos. The species was first described in a 2005 article by Paulina Jenkins and coauthors, who considered the animal to be so distinct from all living rodents, they placed it in a new family, Laonastidae. It is in the monotypic genus \"Laonastes\".\nIn 2006, the classification of the Laotian rock rat was disputed by Mary Dawson and coauthors. Dawson and her colleagues suggested instead it belongs to the ancient fossil family Diatomyidae, that was thought to have been extinct for 11 million years, since the late Miocene. It would thereby represent a Lazarus species. The animals resemble large, dark rats with hairy, thick tails like those of a squirrel. Their skulls are very distinctive and have features that separate them from all other living mammals.\n\nUpon their initial discovery, Jenkins and coauthors (2005) considered the Laotian rock rat to represent a completely new family. The discovery of a new species of an extant mammal genus happens periodically, such as with the leaf muntjac or saola. The discovery of a completely new family is, by comparison, much more unusual. The most recent incident before the discovery of the family Laonastidae by Western science was the discovery of the bumblebee bat (\"Craseonycteris thonglongyai\"; family Craseonycteridae) in 1974. The only other examples from the 20th century are species that are only considered distinct families by a few authorities. These discoveries are: the Chinese river dolphin (\"Lipotes vexillifer\"; family Lipotidae) in 1918, the Zagros mouse-like hamster (\"Calomyscus bailwardi\"; family Calomyscidae) in 1905, and Goeldi's marmoset (\"Callimico goeldii\"; family Callimiconidae) in 1904. Representatives from all the remaining rodent families with living representatives (approximately 30) were discovered before 1900.\n\nJenkins \"et al.\" (2004) did not compare the specimens to known rodent fossils. After such a comparison, Dawson \"et al.\" (2006) were of the opinion that the Laotian rock rat belongs to a previously described family which had only been known from fossils, the Diatomyidae. The Diatomyidae are known from a series of fossils from the early Oligocene (~32.5 mya) until the Miocene (~11 mya). The discovery of the Laotian rock rat means an 11 million-year gap exists in the fossil record where no diatomyids have been found. Dawson \"et al.\" (2006) described the Diatomyidae as a Lazarus taxon due to this gap. The only other mammal Lazarus taxon with a comparable time gap between it and its most recently known fossil relative is the monito del monte, which is part of a marsupial family (Microbiotheriidae) also most recently known from Miocene deposits. Mary Dawson described \"Laonastes\" as the \"coelacanth of rodents\".\n\nThe analysis of mtDNA 12S rRNA and cytochrome \"b\" sequence by Jenkins \"et al.\" (2004) allied \"Laonastes\" with African hystricognath rodents, namely the blesmols and the dassie rat. Support for such a placement was fair, but the exact position could not be resolved. Huchon \"et al.\" (2007) conducted a large-scale molecular phylogeny of rodents, including representatives of all major rodent taxonomic groups, based on 5.5 kb of sequence data from four nuclear and two mitochondrial genes, and a short, interspersed element, insertion analysis including 11 informative loci. Their molecular data place \"Laonastes\" robustly as a sister clade of Ctenodactylidae, and support an ancient divergence during the Lutetian (Early/Middle Eocene, ~44 mya). The earlier molecular study was in error due to long branch attraction and inadequate sampling.\n\nThe genus name for this animal, \"Laonastes\", means \"inhabitant of stone\" (from Greek λαας = \"laas\" = stone, gen: λαος = \"laos\" = of stone and Greek ναστης = \"nastes\" = inhabitant). This is in reference to its presence around limestone rocks and also to the country where it was recently discovered. The specific epithet \"aenigmamus\" means \"enigma mouse\" (from Greek αινιγμα = \"ænigma\" and μυς = \"mus\", \"mouse\") referring to its unknown position among the rodents (Jenkins \"et al.\", 2004).\n\nThe first specimens were found for sale as meat at a market in Thakhek, Khammouan, in 1996. Remains of three additional animals were obtained in 1998 from villagers and in an owl pellet. Return trips to Laos by the Wildlife Conservation Society researchers uncovered several other specimens. These new discoveries have prompted the suggestion that the animals may not be as rare as once thought. On June 13, 2006, David Redfield, a professor emeritus of Florida State University, and Thai wildlife biologist Uthai Treesucon announced they had captured, photographed and videotaped a live specimen of the species in the village of Doy in Laos.\n\nThe animals look generally like rats, with thick, furred tails similar to a squirrel's, but limp. The head is large, with round ears and a somewhat bulbous bridge of the nose, and very long whiskers. Their fur is dark slate grey, with a blackish tail. The belly is lighter, with a small, whitish area in the center. Their eyes are beady and black. They are about long with a tail and weigh about . Jenkins \"et al.\" (2004) described the jaw as hystricognathous, but Dawson \"et al.\" (2006) argued it is sciurognathous. The infraorbital foramen is enlarged, consistent with a hystricomorphous zygomasseteric system. The pterygoid fossae do not connect to the orbit, setting them apart from the hystricognathous rodents.\n\nThe Laotian Rock rat is found in limestone karsts of Khammouan Province and southern Bolikhamxai Province, Laos, and also in a small area of Minh Hóa District, western Quảng Bình Province, Vietnam. In Vietnam, it is found in the 5 communes (\"xã\") of Thượng Hoá, Hóa Sơn, Trung Hoá, Hóa Hợp, and Dân Hoá, and in , near the villages of the Vietic-speaking Ruc, Sach, and Chut ethnic groups. It is also found directly across the border in Hin Namno National Biodiversity Conservation Area, Laos. In Laos, it is most common in the Phou Hin Poun National Biodiversity Conservation Area. Nguyen et al. (2014) suggests that the Quảng Bình and Phou Hin Poun populations may be distinct and genetically isolated from each other.\n\nNicolas et al. (2012) found 8 major geographical clades and 8 to 16 evolutionary significant units among Laotian rock rat populations in Laos, and suggests that \"Laonastes\" may in fact consist of various undescribed cryptic species.\n\nLaotian rock rats are found in regions of karst limestone. They appear to be found only among limestone boulders on hillsides. Villagers in the area are familiar with the animal, calling it \"kha-nyou\", and trapping it for food (Jenkins et al., 2005). The animals are presumed to be nocturnal.\n\nThese rock rats appear to be predominantly herbivores, eating leaves, grass and seeds. They may eat insects, as well, but probably not in high abundance. Females may give birth to a single young (Jenkins \"et al.\", 2005).\n\nLaotian rock rats appear to be quite docile and slow-moving over open ground. They walk with feet splayed outward in a gait described as duck-like. Although not ideal for mobility on open surfaces, this appears to be efficient when scrambling up and across large rocks, the sideways angle allowing for greater surface area for their feet to find purchase on angled surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He succeeded his father as count of Nevers and his grandfather as count of Flanders in 1322. He inherited the county of Rethel from his mother.\n\nIn 1320 Louis married Margaret, second daughter of King Philip V of France and Joan II, Countess of Burgundy, who would later inherit her mother's counties of Burgundy and Artois in 1361. This marriage alliance made him break with the anti-French policy of his grandfather Robert III and great-grandfather Guy I.\n\nHis pro-French policies and excessive taxations levied by Louis caused an uprising in 1323. Beginning as a series of scattered rural riots, the peasant insurrection escalated into a full-scale rebellion that dominated public affairs in Flanders for nearly five years until 1328. The rebels, led by Nicolaas Zannekin, captured the towns of Nieuwpoort, Veurne, Ieper and Kortrijk. In Kortrijk, Zannekin was able to capture Louis himself. In 1325 the King of France, Charles IV intervened whereupon Louis was released from captivity in February 1326 and the \"Peace of Arques\" was sealed. The peace didn't last long and soon hostilities erupted again which made the count flee to France. Louis was able to convince his new liege Philip VI of France to come to his aid and Zannekin and his adherents were decisively defeated by the French royal army in the Battle of Cassel.\n\nWhen the Hundred Years War started, Louis remained steadfast in his French policy, even with the county being economically dependent on England. His actions resulted in an English boycott of the wool trade which in turn sparked a new insurrection under Jacob van Artevelde. In 1339 the count had to flee his lands, never being able to return. Louis was killed at the Battle of Crécy in 1346.\n\nHe and Margaret had one son:\n\n"}
{"id": "311144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311144", "title": "Margaret Fuller", "text": "Margaret Fuller\n\nSarah Margaret Fuller Ossoli (May 23, 1810 – July 19, 1850), commonly known as Margaret Fuller, was an American journalist, critic, and women's rights advocate associated with the American transcendentalism movement. She was the first full-time American female book reviewer in journalism. Her book \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century\" is considered the first major feminist work in the United States.\n\nBorn Sarah Margaret Fuller in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she was given a substantial early education by her father, Timothy Fuller. She later had more formal schooling and became a teacher before, in 1839, she began overseeing what she called \"conversations\": discussions among women meant to compensate for their lack of access to higher education. She became the first editor of the transcendentalist journal \"The Dial\" in 1840, before joining the staff of the \"New York Tribune\" under Horace Greeley in 1844. By the time she was in her 30s, Fuller had earned a reputation as the best-read person in New England, male or female, and became the first woman allowed to use the library at Harvard College. Her seminal work, \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century\", was published in 1845. A year later, she was sent to Europe for the \"Tribune\" as its first female correspondent. She soon became involved with the revolutions in Italy and allied herself with Giuseppe Mazzini. She had a relationship with Giovanni Ossoli, with whom she had a child. All three members of the family died in a shipwreck off Fire Island, New York, as they were traveling to the United States in 1850. Fuller's body was never recovered.\n\nFuller was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. She also encouraged many other reforms in society, including prison reform and the emancipation of slaves in the United States. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including Susan B. Anthony, cite Fuller as a source of inspiration. Many of her contemporaries, however, were not supportive, including her former friend Harriet Martineau. She said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist. Shortly after Fuller's death, her importance faded; the editors who prepared her letters to be published, believing her fame would be short-lived, censored or altered much of her work before publication.\n\nSarah Margaret Fuller was born on May 23, 1810, in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, the first child of Congressman Timothy Fuller and Margaret Crane Fuller. She was named after her paternal grandmother and her mother, but by age nine she dropped \"Sarah\" and insisted on being called \"Margaret.\" The Margaret Fuller House, in which she was born, is still standing. Her father taught her to read and write at the age of three and a half, shortly after the couple's second daughter, Julia Adelaide, died at 14 months old. He offered her an education as rigorous as any boy's at the time and forbade her to read the typical feminine fare of the time, such as etiquette books and sentimental novels. He incorporated Latin into his teaching shortly after the birth of the couple's son Eugene in May 1815, and soon Margaret was translating simple passages from Virgil. Later in life Margaret blamed her father's exacting love and his valuation of accuracy and precision for her childhood nightmares and sleepwalking. During the day Margaret spent time with her mother, who taught her household chores and sewing. In 1817, her brother William Henry Fuller was born, and her father was elected as a representative in the United States Congress. For the next eight years, he spent four to six months a year in Washington, D.C. At age ten, Fuller wrote a cryptic note which her father saved: \"On 23 May 1810, was born one foredoomed to sorrow and pain, and like others to have misfortunes.\"\n\nFuller began her formal education at the Port School in Cambridgeport in 1819 before attending the Boston Lyceum for Young Ladies from 1821 to 1822. In 1824, she was sent to the School for Young Ladies in Groton, on the advice of aunts and uncles, though she resisted the idea at first. While she was there, Timothy Fuller did not run for re-election, in order to help John Quincy Adams with his presidential campaign in 1824; he hoped Adams would return the favor with a governmental appointment. On June 17, 1825, Fuller attended the ceremony at which the American Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette laid the cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument 50 years after the battle. Fuller left the Groton school after two years and returned home at 16. At home she studied the classics and trained herself in several modern languages and read world literature. By this time, she realized she did not fit in with other young women her age. She wrote, \"I have felt that I was not born to the common womanly lot.\" Eliza Farrar, wife of Harvard professor John Farrar and author of \"The Young Lady's Friend\" (1836), attempted to train her in feminine etiquette until the age of 20, but was never wholly successful.\n\nFuller was an avid reader. By the time she was in her 30s, she had earned a reputation as the best-read person, male or female, in New England. She used her knowledge to give private lessons based on the teaching style of Elizabeth Palmer Peabody. Fuller hoped to earn her living through journalism and translation; her first published work, a response to historian George Bancroft, appeared in November 1834 in the \"North American Review\". When she was 23, her father's law practice failed and he moved the family to a farm in Groton. On February 20, 1835, Frederic Henry Hedge and James Freeman Clarke asked her to contribute to each of their periodicals. Clarke helped her publish her first literary review in the \"Western Messenger\" in June: criticisms of recent biographies on George Crabbe and Hannah More. In the fall of that year, she suffered a terrible migraine with a fever that lasted nine days. Fuller continued to experience such headaches throughout her life. While she was still recovering, her father died of cholera on October 2, 1835. She was deeply affected by his death: \"My father's image follows me constantly\", she wrote. She vowed to step in as the head of the family and take care of her widowed mother and younger siblings. Her father had not left a will, and two of her uncles gained control of his property and finances, later assessed at $18,098.15, and the family had to rely on them for support. Humiliated by the way her uncles were treating the family, Fuller wrote that she regretted being \"of the softer sex, and never more than now\".\nAround this time, Fuller was hoping to prepare a biography of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, but felt that she could work on it only if she traveled to Europe. Her father's death and her sudden responsibility for her family caused her to abandon this idea. In 1836, Fuller was given a job teaching at Bronson Alcott's Temple School in Boston, where she remained for a year. She then accepted an invitation to teach under Hiram Fuller (no relation) at the Greene Street School in Providence, Rhode Island, in April 1837 with the unusually high salary of $1,000 per year. Her family sold the Groton farm and Fuller moved with them to Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. On November 6, 1839, Fuller held the first of her \"conversations\", discussions among local women who met in the Boston home of the Peabodys. Fuller intended to compensate for the lack of women's education with discussions and debates focused on subjects including the fine arts, history, mythology, literature, and nature. Serving as the \"nucleus of conversation\", Fuller also intended to answer the \"great questions\" facing women: \"What were we born to do? How shall we do it? which so few ever propose to themselves 'till their best years are gone by\". A number of significant figures in the women's rights movement attended these gatherings, including Sophia Dana Ripley, Caroline Sturgis, and Maria White Lowell.\n\nIn October 1839, Ralph Waldo Emerson was seeking an editor for his transcendentalist journal \"The Dial\". After several declined the position, he offered it to Fuller, referring to her as \"my vivacious friend.\" Emerson had met Fuller in Cambridge in 1835; of that meeting, he admitted: \"she made me laugh more than I liked.\" The next summer, Fuller spent two weeks at Emerson's home in Concord. Fuller accepted Emerson's offer to edit \"The Dial\" on October 20, 1839, and began work in the first week of 1840. She edited the journal from 1840 to 1842, though her promised annual salary of $200 was never paid. Because of her role, she was soon recognized as one of the most important figures of the transcendental movement and was invited to George Ripley's Brook Farm, a communal experiment. Fuller never officially joined the community but was a frequent visitor, often spending New Year's Eve there. In the summer of 1843, she traveled to Chicago, Milwaukee, Niagara Falls, and Buffalo, New York; while there, she interacted with several Native Americans, including members of the Ottawa and the Chippewa tribes. She reported her experiences in a book called \"Summer on the Lakes\", which she completed writing on her 34th birthday in 1844. The critic Evert Augustus Duyckinck called it \"the only genuine book, I can think of, this season.\" Fuller used the library at Harvard College to do research on the Great Lakes region, and became the first woman allowed to use Harvard's library.\n\nFuller's \"The Great Lawsuit\" was written in serial form for \"The Dial\". She originally intended to name the work \"The Great Lawsuit: Man 'versus' Men, Woman 'versus' Women\"; when it was expanded and published independently in 1845, it was entitled \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century\". After completing it, she wrote to a friend: \"I had put a good deal of my true self in it, as if, I suppose I went away now, the measure of my footprint would be left on earth.\" The work discussed the role that women played in American democracy and Fuller's opinion on possibilities for improvement. It has since become one of the major documents in American feminism. It is considered the first of its kind in the United States.\n\nFuller left \"The Dial\" in 1844 in part because of ill health but also because of her disappointment with the publication's dwindling subscription list. She moved to New York that autumn and joined Horace Greeley's \"New York Tribune\" as a literary critic, becoming the first full-time book reviewer in American journalism and, by 1846, the publication's first female editor. Her first article, a review of a collection of essays by Emerson, appeared in the December 1, 1844, issue. At this time, the \"Tribune\" had some 50,000 subscribers and Fuller earned $500 a year for her work. In addition to American books, she reviewed foreign literature, concerts, lectures, and art exhibits. During her four years with the publication, she published more than 250 columns, most signed with a \"*\" as a byline. In these columns, Fuller discussed topics ranging from art and literature to political and social issues such as the plight of slaves and women's rights. She also published poetry; her poems, styled after the work of Emerson, do not have the same intellectual vigor as her criticism.\n\nAround this time, she was also involved in a scandal involving fellow literary critic Edgar Allan Poe, who had been carrying on a public flirtation with the married poet Frances Sargent Osgood. Another poet, Elizabeth F. Ellet, had become enamored of Poe and jealous of Osgood and suggested the relationship between Poe and Osgood was more than an innocent flirtation. Osgood then sent Fuller and Anne Lynch Botta to Poe's cottage on her behalf to request that he return the personal letters she had sent him. Angered by their interference, Poe called them \"Busy-bodies\". A public scandal erupted and continued until Osgood's estranged husband Samuel Stillman Osgood stepped in and threatened to sue Ellet.\n\nIn 1846 the \"New York Tribune\" sent Fuller to Europe, specifically England and Italy, as its first female foreign correspondent. She traveled from Boston to Liverpool in August on the \"Cambria\", a vessel that used both sail and steam to make the journey in ten days and sixteen hours. Over the next four years she provided the \"Tribune\" with thirty-seven reports. She interviewed many prominent writers including George Sand and Thomas Carlyle—whom she found disappointing because of his reactionary politics, among other things. George Sand had previously been an idol of hers, but Fuller was disappointed when Sand chose not to run for the French National Assembly, saying that women were not ready to vote or to hold political office. Fuller was also given a letter of introduction to Elizabeth Barrett by Cornelius Mathews, but did not meet her at that time, because Barrett had just eloped with Robert Browning.\n\nIn England in the spring of 1846, she met Giuseppe Mazzini, who had been in exile there from Italy since 1837. Fuller also met the Italian revolutionary Giovanni Angelo Ossoli, a marquis who had been disinherited by his family because of his support for Mazzini. Fuller and Ossoli moved in together in Florence, Italy, likely before they were married, though whether they ever married is uncertain. Fuller was originally opposed to marrying him, in part because of the difference in their religions; she was Protestant and he was Roman Catholic. Emerson speculated that the couple was \"married perhaps in Oct. Nov. or Dec\" of 1847, though he did not explain his reasoning. Biographers have speculated that the couple married on April 4, 1848, to celebrate the anniversary of their first meeting but one biographer provided evidence they first met on April 1 during the ceremony called \"Lavanda degli Altari\" (Altars Lavage). By the time the couple moved to Florence, they were referred to as husband and wife, though it is unclear if any formal ceremony took place. It seems certain that at the time their child was born, they were not married. By New Year's Day 1848, she suspected that she was pregnant but kept it from Ossoli for several weeks. Their child, Angelo Eugene Philip Ossoli, was born in early September 1848 and nicknamed Angelino. The couple was very secretive about their relationship but, after Angelino suffered an unnamed illness, they became less so. Fuller informed her mother about Ossoli and Angelino in August 1849 in a letter that explained that she had kept silent so as not to upset her \"but it has become necessary, on account of the child, for us to live publicly and permanently together.\" Her mother's response makes it clear that she was aware that the couple was not legally married. Even so, she was happy for her daughter, writing: \"I send my first kiss with my fervent blessing to my grandson.\"\n\nThe couple supported Giuseppe Mazzini's revolution for the establishment of a Roman Republic in 1849. Ossoli fought in the struggle while Fuller volunteered at a supporting hospital. When the republicans they supported met defeat, they had to flee Italy and decided to move to the United States. En route, they returned to Paris, where she finally met Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Fuller intended to use her experience in Italy to write a book about the history of the Roman Republic—a work she may have begun as early as 1847— and hoped to find an American publisher after a British one rejected it. She believed the work would be her most important, referring to it in a March 1849 letter to her brother Richard as, \"something good which may survive my troubled existence.\"\n\nIn the beginning of 1850, Fuller wrote to a friend: \"It has long seemed that in the year 1850 I should stand on some important plateau in the ascent of life ... I feel however no marked and important change as yet.\" Also that year, Fuller wrote: \"I am absurdly fearful and various omens have combined to give me a dark feeling ... It seems to me that my future upon earth will soon close ... I have a vague expectation of some crisis—I know not what\". A few days after writing this, Fuller, Ossoli, and their child began a five-week return voyage to the United States aboard the ship \"Elizabeth\", an American merchant freighter carrying cargo that included mostly marble from Carrara. They set sail on May 17. At sea, the ship's captain, Seth Hasty, died of smallpox. Angelino contracted the disease and recovered.\n\nPossibly because of the inexperienced first mate, now serving as captain, the ship slammed into a sandbar less than 100 yards from Fire Island, New York, on July 19, 1850, around Many of the other passengers and crew members abandoned ship. The first mate, Mr. Bangs, urged Fuller and Ossoli to try to save themselves and their child as he himself jumped overboard, later claiming he believed Fuller had wanted to be left behind to die. On the beach, people arrived with carts hoping to salvage any cargo washed ashore. None made any effort to rescue the crew or passengers of the \"Elizabeth\", though they were only 50 yards from shore. Most of those aboard attempted to swim to shore, leaving Fuller and Ossoli and Angelino some of the last on the ship. Ossoli was thrown overboard by a massive wave and, after the wave had passed, a crewman who witnessed the event said Fuller could not be seen.\n\nHenry David Thoreau traveled to New York, at the urging of Emerson, to search the shore but neither Fuller's body nor that of her husband was ever recovered. Angelino's had washed ashore. Few of their possessions were found other than some of the child's clothes and a few letters. Fuller's manuscript on the history of the Roman Republic was also lost. A memorial to Fuller was erected on the beach at Fire Island in 1901 through the efforts of Julia Ward Howe. A cenotaph to Fuller and Ossoli, under which Angelino is buried, is in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The inscription reads, in part:\n\nWithin a week after her death, Horace Greeley suggested to Emerson that a biography of Fuller, to be called \"Margaret and Her Friends\", be prepared quickly \"before the interest excited by her sad decease has passed away\". Many of her writings were soon collected together by her brother Arthur as \"At Home and Abroad\" (1856) and \"Life Without and Life Within\" (1858). He also edited a new version of \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century\" in 1855. In February 1852, \"The Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli\" was published, edited by Emerson, James Freeman Clarke, and William Henry Channing, though much of the work was censored or reworded. It left out details about her love affair with Ossoli and an earlier relationship with a man named James Nathan. The three editors, believing the public interest in Fuller would be short-lived and that she would not survive as a historical figure, were not concerned about accuracy. For a time, it was the best-selling biography of the decade and went through thirteen editions before the end of the century. The book focused on her personality rather than her work. Detractors of the book ignored her status as a critic and instead criticized her personal life and her \"unwomanly\" arrogance.\n\nFuller was an early proponent of feminism and especially believed in providing education to women. Once equal educational rights were afforded women, she believed, women could push for equal political rights as well. She advocated that women seek any employment they wish, rather than catering to the stereotypical \"feminine\" roles of the time, such as teaching. She once said, \"If you ask me what office women should fill, I reply—any ... let them be sea captains if you will. I do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office\". She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time and disliked the popular female poets of her time. Fuller also warned women to be careful about marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, \"I wish woman to live, \"first\" for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty\". By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single. Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: \"There is no wholly masculine man ... no purely feminine\" but that both were present in any individual. She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the Minerva) and the \"lyrical\" or \"Femality\" side (the Muse). She admired the work of Emanuel Swedenborg, who believed men and women shared \"an angelic ministry\", as she wrote, as well as Charles Fourier, who placed \"Woman on an entire equality with Man\". Unlike several contemporary women writers, including \"Mrs. Sigourney\" and \"Mrs. Stowe\", she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as \"Margaret\".\n\nFuller also advocated reform at all levels of society, including prison. In October 1844, she visited Sing Sing and interviewed the women prisoners, even staying overnight in the facility. Sing Sing was developing a more humane system for its women inmates, many of whom were prostitutes. Fuller was also concerned about the homeless and those living in dire poverty, especially in New York. She also admitted that, though she was raised to believe \"that the Indian obstinately refused to be civilized\", her travels in the American West made her realize that the white man unfairly treated the Native Americans; she considered Native Americans an important part of American heritage. She also supported the rights of African-Americans, referring to \"this cancer of slavery\", and suggested that those who were interested in the abolition movement follow the same reasoning when considering the rights of women: \"As the friend of the Negro assumes that one man cannot by right hold another in bondage, so should the Friend of Woman assume that Man cannot by right lay even well-meant restrictions on Woman.\" She suggested that those who spoke against the emancipation of slaves were similar to those who did not support the emancipation of Italy.\n\nFuller agreed with the transcendental concern for the psychological well-being of the individual, though she was never comfortable being labeled a transcendentalist. Even so, she wrote, if being labeled a transcendentalist means \"that I have an active mind frequently busy with large topics I hope it is so\". She criticized people such as Emerson, however, for focusing too much on individual improvement and not enough on social reform. Like other members of the so-called Transcendental Club, she rebelled against the past and believed in the possibility of change. However, unlike others in the movement, her rebellion was not based on religion. Though Fuller occasionally attended Unitarian congregations, she did not entirely identify with that religion. As biographer Charles Capper has noted, she \"was happy to remain on the Unitarian margins.\"\n\nMargaret Fuller was especially known in her time for her personality and, in particular, for being overly self-confident and having a bad temper. This personality was the inspiration for the character Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel \"The Scarlet Letter\", specifically her radical thinking about \"the whole race of womanhood\". She may also be the basis for the character Zenobia in another of Hawthorne's works, \"The Blithedale Romance\". Hawthorne and his then-fiancée Sophia had first met Fuller in October 1839.\n\nShe was also an inspiration to poet Walt Whitman, who believed in her call for the forging of a new national identity and a truly American literature. Elizabeth Barrett Browning was also a strong admirer, but believed that Fuller's unconventional views were unappreciated in the United States and, therefore, she was better off dead. She also said that Fuller's history of the Roman Republic would have been her greatest work: \"The work she was preparing upon Italy would probably have been more equal to her faculty than anything previously produced by her pen (her other writings being curiously inferior to the impressions her conversation gave you)\". An 1860 essay collection, \"Historical Pictures Retouched\", by Caroline Healey Dall, called Fuller's \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century\" \"doubtless the most brilliant, complete, and scholarly statement ever made on the subject\". Despite his personal issues with Fuller, the typically harsh literary critic Edgar Allan Poe wrote of the work as \"a book which few women in the country could have written, and no woman in the country would have published, with the exception of Miss Fuller\", noting its \"independence\" and \"unmitigated radicalism\". Thoreau also thought highly of the book, suggesting that its strength came in part from Fuller's conversational ability. As he called it, it was \"rich extempore writing, talking with pen in hand\".\n\nAnother admirer of Fuller was Susan B. Anthony, a pioneer of women's rights, who wrote that Fuller \"possessed more influence on the thought of American women than any woman previous to her time\". Fuller's work may have partially inspired the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848. Anthony, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Matilda Joslyn Gage wrote in their \"History of Woman Suffrage\" that Fuller \"was the precursor of the Women's Rights agitation\". Modern scholars have suggested \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century\" was the first major women's rights work since Mary Wollstonecraft's \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" (1792), though an early comparison between the two women came from George Eliot in 1855. It is unclear if Fuller was familiar with Wollstonecraft's works; in her childhood, her father prevented her from reading them. In 1995, Fuller was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\n\nFuller, however, was not without her critics. A one-time friend, the English writer Harriet Martineau was one of her harshest detractors after Fuller's death. Martineau said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist, that she had \"shallow conceits\" and often \"looked down upon persons who acted instead of talking finely ... and despised those who, like myself, could not adopt her scale of valuation\". The influential editor Rufus Wilmot Griswold, who believed she went against his notion of feminine modesty, referred to \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century\" as \"an eloquent expression of her discontent at having been created female\". New York writer Charles Frederick Briggs said that she was \"wasting the time of her readers\", especially because she was an unmarried woman and therefore could not \"truly represent the female character\". English writer and critic Matthew Arnold scoffed at Fuller's conversations as well, saying, \"My G–d, what rot did she and the other female dogs of Boston talk about Greek mythology!\" Sophia Hawthorne, who had previously been a supporter of Fuller, was critical of her after \"Woman of the Nineteenth Century\" was published:\nFuller had angered fellow poet and critic James Russell Lowell when she reviewed his work, calling him \"absolutely wanting in the true spirit and tone of poesy ... his verse is stereotyped, his thought sounds no depth; and posterity will not remember him.\" In response, Lowell took revenge in his satirical \"A Fable for Critics\", first published in October 1848. At first, he considered excluding her entirely but ultimately gave her what was called the \"most wholly negative characterization\" in the work. Referring to her as Miranda, Lowell wrote that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own, she was genuine only in her spite and \"when acting as censor, she privately blows a censer of vanity 'neath her own nose\".\n\nShortly after Fuller's death, her importance faded. Her obituary in the newspaper she had once edited, the \"Daily Tribune\", said that her works had a few great sentiments, \"but as a whole they must commend themselves mainly by their vigor of thought and habitual fearlessness rather than freedom of utterance\". As biographer Abby Slater wrote, \"Margaret had been demoted from a position of importance in her own right to one in which her only importance was in the company she kept\". Years later, Hawthorne's son Julian wrote, \"The majority of readers will, I think, not be inconsolable that poor Margaret Fuller has at last taken her place with the numberless other dismal frauds who fill the limbo of human pretension and failure.\" In the twentieth century, American writer Elizabeth Hardwick, former wife of Robert Lowell, wrote an essay called \"The Genius of Margaret Fuller\" (1986). She compared her own move from Boston to New York to Fuller's, saying that Boston was not a good place for intellectuals, despite the assumption that it was the best place for intellectuals.\n\nIn 1995, Fuller was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\n\nOn June 21, 2016, a historical marker in honor of Fuller was placed in Polhill Park in Beacon, NY, to commemorate her staying at Van Vliet boarding house. For the dedication ceremony, Fuller's poem, \"Truth and Form,\" was set to music by Debra Kaye and performed by singer, Kelly Ellenwood.\n\nPosthumous editions\n\n\n\nBiographical information\nWorks\nOther\n"}
{"id": "89796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89796", "title": "Mitochondrial DNA", "text": "Mitochondrial DNA\n\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA or mDNA) is the DNA located in mitochondria, cellular organelles within eukaryotic cells that convert chemical energy from food into a form that cells can use, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mitochondrial DNA is only a small portion of the DNA in a eukaryotic cell; most of the DNA can be found in the cell nucleus and, in plants and algae, also in plastids such as chloroplasts.\n\nIn humans, the 16,569 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA encode for only 37 genes. Human mitochondrial DNA was the first significant part of the human genome to be sequenced. In most species, including humans, mtDNA is inherited solely from the mother.\n\nSince animal mtDNA evolves faster than nuclear genetic markers, it represents a mainstay of phylogenetics and evolutionary biology. It also permits an examination of the relatedness of populations, and so has become important in anthropology and biogeography.\n\nNuclear and mitochondrial DNA are thought to be of separate evolutionary origin, with the mtDNA being derived from the circular genomes of the bacteria that were engulfed by the early ancestors of today's eukaryotic cells. This theory is called the endosymbiotic theory. Each mitochondrion is estimated to contain 2–10 mtDNA copies. In the cells of extant organisms, the vast majority of the proteins present in the mitochondria (numbering approximately 1500 different types in mammals) are coded for by nuclear DNA, but the genes for some, if not most, of them are thought to have originally been of bacterial origin, having since been transferred to the eukaryotic nucleus during evolution.\n\nThe reasons why mitochondria have retained some genes are debated. The existence in some species of mitochondrion-derived organelles lacking a genome suggests that complete gene loss is possible, and transferring mitochondrial genes to the nucleus has several advantages. The difficulty of targeting remotely-produced hydrophobic protein products to the mitochondrion is one hypothesis for why some genes are retained in mtDNA; colocalisation for redox regulation is another, citing the desirability of localised control over mitochondrial machinery. Recent analysis of a wide range of mtDNA genomes suggests that both these features may dictate mitochondrial gene retention.\n\nIn most multicellular organisms, mtDNA is inherited from the mother (maternally inherited). Mechanisms for this include simple dilution (an egg contains on average 200,000 mtDNA molecules, whereas a healthy human sperm was reported to contain on average 5 molecules ), degradation of sperm mtDNA in the male genital tract, in the fertilized egg, and, at least in a few organisms, failure of sperm mtDNA to enter the egg. Whatever the mechanism, this single parent (uniparental inheritance) pattern of mtDNA inheritance is found in most animals, most plants and in fungi as well.\n\nIn sexual reproduction, mitochondria are normally inherited exclusively from the mother; the mitochondria in mammalian sperm are usually destroyed by the egg cell after fertilization. Also, most mitochondria are present at the base of the sperm's tail, which is used for propelling the sperm cells; sometimes the tail is lost during fertilization. In 1999 it was reported that paternal sperm mitochondria (containing mtDNA) are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. Some \"in vitro\" fertilization techniques, particularly injecting a sperm into an oocyte, may interfere with this.\n\nThe fact that mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited enables genealogical researchers to trace maternal lineage far back in time. (Y-chromosomal DNA, paternally inherited, is used in an analogous way to determine the patrilineal history.) This is usually accomplished on human mitochondrial DNA by sequencing the hypervariable control regions (HVR1 or HVR2), and sometimes the complete molecule of the mitochondrial DNA, as a genealogical DNA test. HVR1, for example, consists of about 440 base pairs. These 440 base pairs are then compared to the control regions of other individuals (either specific people or subjects in a database) to determine maternal lineage. Most often, the comparison is made to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence. Vilà \"et al.\" have published studies tracing the matrilineal descent of domestic dogs to wolves.\nThe concept of the Mitochondrial Eve is based on the same type of analysis, attempting to discover the origin of humanity by tracking the lineage back in time.\n\nmtDNA is highly conserved, and its relatively slow mutation rates (compared to other DNA regions such as microsatellites) make it useful for studying the evolutionary relationships—phylogeny—of organisms. Biologists can determine and then compare mtDNA sequences among different species and use the comparisons to build an evolutionary tree for the species examined. However, due to the slow mutation rates it experiences, it is often hard to distinguish between closely related species to any large degree, so other methods of analysis must be used.\n\nEntities undergoing uniparental inheritance and with little to no recombination may be expected to be subject to Muller's ratchet, the accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost. Animal populations of mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process known as the mtDNA bottleneck. The bottleneck exploits stochastic processes in the cell to increase in the cell-to-cell variability in mutant load as an organism develops: a single egg cell with some proportion of mutant mtDNA thus produces an embryo where different cells have different mutant loads. Cell-level selection may then act to remove those cells with more mutant mtDNA, leading to a stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations. The mechanism underlying the bottleneck is debated, with a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence for a combination of random partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and random turnover of mtDNA molecules within the cell.\n\nDoubly uniparental inheritance of mtDNA is observed in bivalve mollusks. In those species, females have only one type of mtDNA (F), whereas males have F type mtDNA in their somatic cells, but M type of mtDNA (which can be as much as 30% divergent) in germline cells. Paternally inherited mitochondria have additionally been reported in some insects such as fruit flies, honeybees, and periodical cicadas.\n\nMale mitochondrial inheritance was recently discovered in Plymouth Rock chickens. Evidence supports rare instances of male mitochondrial inheritance in some mammals as well. Specifically, documented occurrences exist for mice, where the male-inherited mitochondria were subsequently rejected. It has also been found in sheep, and in cloned cattle. Rare cases of male mitochondrial inheritance have been documented in humans.\n\nAlthough many of these cases involve cloned embryos or subsequent rejection of the paternal mitochondria, others document \"in vivo\" inheritance and persistence under lab conditions.\n\nAn IVF technique known as mitochondrial donation or mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT) results in offspring containing mtDNA from a donor female, and nuclear DNA from the mother and father. In the spindle transfer procedure, the nucleus of an egg is inserted into the cytoplasm of an egg from a donor female which has had its nucleus removed, but still contains the donor female's mtDNA. The composite egg is then fertilized with the male's sperm. The procedure is used when a woman with genetically defective mitochondria wishes to procreate and produce offspring with healthy mitochondria. The first known child to be born as a result of mitochondrial donation was a boy born to a Jordanian couple in Mexico on 6 April 2016.\n\nIn most multicellular organisms, the mtDNA – or mitogenome – is organized as a circular, covalently closed, double-stranded DNA. But in many unicellular (e.g. the ciliate \"Tetrahymena\" or the green alga \"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\") and in rare cases also in multicellular organisms (e.g. in some species of Cnidaria) the mtDNA is found as linearly organized DNA. Most of these linear mtDNAs possess telomerase-independent telomeres (i.e. the ends of the linear DNA) with different modes of replication, which have made them interesting objects of research, as many of these unicellular organisms with linear mtDNA are known pathogens.\n\nFor human mitochondrial DNA (and probably for that of metazoans in general), 100–10,000 separate copies of mtDNA are usually present per somatic cell (egg and sperm cells are exceptions). In mammals, each double-stranded circular mtDNA molecule consists of 15,000–17,000 base pairs. The two strands of mtDNA are differentiated by their nucleotide content, with a guanine-rich strand referred to as the heavy strand (or H-strand) and a cytosine-rich strand referred to as the light strand (or L-strand). However, confusion of labeling of these strands is widespread, and appears to originate with a identification of the majority coding strand as the heavy in one influential article in 1999. The light strand encodes 28 genes, and the heavy strand encodes 9 genes for a total of 37 genes. Of the 37 genes, 13 are for proteins (polypeptides), 22 are for transfer RNA (tRNA) and two are for the small and large subunits of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The human mitogenome contains overlapping genes (ATP8 and ATP6 as well as ND4L and ND4: see the human mitochondrial genome map), a feature that is rare in animal genomes. The 37-gene pattern is also seen among most metazoans, although in some cases one or more of these genes is absent and the mtDNA size range is greater.\n\nGreat variation in mtDNA gene content and size exists among fungi and plants, although there appears to be a core subset of genes that are present in all eukaryotes (except for the few that have no mitochondria at all).\nSome plant species have enormous mitochondrial genomes, with \"Silene conica\" mtDNA containing as many as 11,300,000 base pairs. Surprisingly, even those huge mtDNAs contain the same number and kinds of genes as related plants with much smaller mtDNAs.\nThe genome of the mitochondrion of the cucumber (\"Cucumis sativus\") consists of three circular chromosomes (lengths 1556, 84 and 45 kilobases), which are entirely or largely autonomous with regard to their replication.\n\nThe smallest mitochondrial genome sequenced to date is the 5,967 bp mtDNA of the parasite \"Plasmodium falciparum\".\n\nThere are six main genome types found in mitochondrial genomes, classified by their structure (e.g. circular versus linear), size, presence of introns or plasmid like structures, and whether the genetic material is a singular molecule or collection of homogeneous or heterogeneous molecules.\n\nThere is only one mitochondrial genome type found in animal cells. This genome usually contains one circular molecule with between 11–28 kbp of genetic material (type 1).\n\nThere are three different genome types found in plants and fungi. The first type is a circular genome that has introns (type 2) and may range from 19 to 1000 kbp in length. The second genome type is a circular genome (about 20–1000 kbp) that also has a plasmid-like structure (1 kb) (type 3). The final genome type that can be found in plant and fungi is a linear genome made up of homogeneous DNA molecules (type 5).\n\nProtists contain the most diverse mitochondrial genomes, with five different types found in this kingdom. Type 2, type 3 and type 5 mentioned in the plant and fungal genomes also exists in some protist, as well as two unique genome types. The first of these is a heterogeneous collection of circular DNA molecules (type 4) and the final genome type found in protists is a heterogeneous collection of linear molecules (type 6). Genome types 4 and 6 both range from 1–200 kbp in size.\n\nEndosymbiotic gene transfer, the process of genes that were coded in the mitochondrial genome being transferred to the cell's main genome likely explains why more complex organisms, such as humans, have smaller mitochondrial genomes than simpler organisms, such as protists.\n\nMitochondrial DNA is replicated by the DNA polymerase gamma complex which is composed of a 140 kDa catalytic DNA polymerase encoded by the \"POLG\" gene and two 55 kDa accessory subunits encoded by the \"POLG2\" gene. The replisome machinery is formed by DNA polymerase, TWINKLE and mitochondrial SSB proteins. TWINKLE is a helicase, which unwinds short stretches of dsDNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction. All these polypeptides are encoded in the nuclear genome.\n\nDuring embryogenesis, replication of mtDNA is strictly down-regulated from the fertilized oocyte through the preimplantation embryo. The resulting reduction in per-cell copy number of mtDNA plays a role in the mitochondrial bottleneck, exploiting cell-to-cell variability to ameliorate the inheritance of damaging mutations. At the blastocyst stage, the onset of mtDNA replication is specific to the cells of the trophectoderm. In contrast, the cells of the inner cell mass restrict mtDNA replication until they receive the signals to differentiate to specific cell types.\n\nIn animal mitochondria, each DNA strand is transcribed continuously and produces a polycistronic RNA molecule. Between most (but not all) protein-coding regions, tRNAs are present (see the human mitochondrial genome map). During transcription, the tRNAs acquire their characteristic L-shape that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes. With the mitochondrial RNA processing, individual mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA sequences are released from the primary transcript. Folded tRNAs therefore act as secondary structure punctuations.\n\nThe concept that mtDNA is particularly susceptible to reactive oxygen species generated by the respiratory chain due to its proximity remains controversial. mtDNA does not accumulate any more oxidative base damage than nuclear DNA. It has been reported that at least some types of oxidative DNA damage are repaired more efficiently in mitochondria than they are in the nucleus. mtDNA is packaged with proteins which appear to be as protective as proteins of the nuclear chromatin. Moreover, mitochondria evolved a unique mechanism which maintains mtDNA integrity through degradation of excessively damaged genomes followed by replication of intact/repaired mtDNA. This mechanism is not present in the nucleus and is enabled by multiple copies of mtDNA present in mitochondria The outcome of mutation in mtDNA may be an alteration in the coding instructions for some proteins, which may have an effect on organism metabolism and/or fitness.\n\nMutations of mitochondrial DNA can lead to a number of illnesses including exercise intolerance and Kearns–Sayre syndrome (KSS), which causes a person to lose full function of heart, eye, and muscle movements. Some evidence suggests that they might be major contributors to the aging process and age-associated pathologies. Particularly in the context of disease, the proportion of mutant mtDNA molecules in a cell is termed heteroplasmy. The within-cell and between-cell distributions of heteroplasmy dictate the onset and severity of disease and are influenced by complicated stochastic processes within the cell and during development.\n\nMutations in mitochondrial tRNAs can be responsible for severe diseases like the MELAS and MERRF syndromes.\n\nMutations in nuclear genes that encode proteins that mitochondria use can also contribute to mitochondrial diseases. These diseases do not follow mitochondrial inheritance patterns, but instead follow Mendelian inheritance patterns.\n\nRecently a mutation in mtDNA has been used to help diagnose prostate cancer in patients with negative prostate biopsy.\n\nThough the idea is controversial, some evidence suggests a link between aging and mitochondrial genome dysfunction. In essence, mutations in mtDNA upset a careful balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enzymatic ROS scavenging (by enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and others). However, some mutations that increase ROS production (e.g., by reducing antioxidant defenses) in worms increase, rather than decrease, their longevity. Also, naked mole rats, rodents about the size of mice, live about eight times longer than mice despite having reduced, compared to mice, antioxidant defenses and increased oxidative damage to biomolecules. Once, there was thought to be a positive feedback loop at work (a 'Vicious Cycle'); as mitochondrial DNA accumulates genetic damage caused by free radicals, the mitochondria lose function and leak free radicals into the cytosol. A decrease in mitochondrial function reduces overall metabolic efficiency. However, this concept was conclusively disproved when it was demonstrated that mice, which were genetically altered to accumulate mtDNA mutations at accelerated rate do age prematurely, but their tissues do not produce more ROS as predicted by the 'Vicious Cycle' hypothesis. Supporting a link between longevity and mitochondrial DNA, some studies have found correlations between biochemical properties of the mitochondrial DNA and the longevity of species. Extensive research is being conducted to further investigate this link and methods to combat aging. Presently, gene therapy and nutraceutical supplementation are popular areas of ongoing research. Bjelakovic et al. analyzed the results of 78 studies between 1977 and 2012, involving a total of 296,707 participants, and concluded that antioxidant supplements do not reduce all-cause mortality nor extend lifespan, while some of them, such as beta carotene, vitamin E, and higher doses of vitamin A, may actually increase mortality.\n\nIncreased mtDNA damage is a feature of several neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nThe brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease have elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage in both nuclear DNA and mtDNA, but the mtDNA has approximately 10-fold higher levels than nuclear DNA. It has been proposed that aged mitochondria is the critical factor in the origin of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nIn Huntington’s disease, mutant huntingtin protein causes mitochondria dysfunction involving inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport, higher levels of reactive oxygen species and increased oxidative stress. Mutant huntingtin protein promotes oxidative damage to mtDNA, as well as nuclear DNA, that may contribute to Huntington’s disease pathology.\n\nThe DNA oxidation product 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is a well-established marker of oxidative DNA damage. In persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the enzymes that normally repair 8-oxoG DNA damages in the mtDNA of spinal motor neurons are impaired. Thus oxidative damage to mtDNA of motor neurons may be a significant factor in the etiology of ALS.\n\nOver the past decade, an Israeli research group led by Professor Vadim Fraifeld has shown that extraordinarily strong and significant correlations exist between the mtDNA base composition and animal species-specific maximum life spans. As demonstrated in their work, higher mtDNA guanine + cytosine content (GC%) strongly associates with longer maximum life spans across animal species. An additional astonishing observation is that the mtDNA GC% correlation with the maximum life spans is independent of the well-known correlation between animal species metabolic rate and maximum life spans. The mtDNA GC% and resting metabolic rate explain the differences in animal species maximum life spans in a multiplicative manner (i.e., species maximum life span = their mtDNA GC% * metabolic rate). To support the scientific community in carrying out comparative analyses between mtDNA features and longevity across animals, a dedicated database was built named MitoAge.\n\nDeletion breakpoints frequently occur within or near regions showing non-canonical (non-B) conformations, namely hairpins, cruciforms and cloverleaf-like elements. Moreover, there is data supporting the involvement of helix-distorting intrinsically curved regions and long G-tetrads in eliciting instability events. In addition, higher breakpoint densities were consistently observed within GC-skewed regions and in the close vicinity of the degenerate sequence motif YMMYMNNMMHM. Recently (2017) was found that all mitochodrial genomes sequenced so far contain many of inverted repeats necessary for cruciform DNA formation and these loci are particularly enriched in replication origin sites, D-loops and stem loops.\n\nUnlike nuclear DNA, which is inherited from both parents and in which genes are rearranged in the process of recombination, there is usually no change in mtDNA from parent to offspring. Although mtDNA also recombines, it does so with copies of itself within the same mitochondrion. Because of this and because the mutation rate of animal mtDNA is higher than that of nuclear DNA, mtDNA is a powerful tool for tracking ancestry through females (matrilineage) and has been used in this role to track the ancestry of many species back hundreds of generations.\n\nThe rapid mutation rate (in animals) makes mtDNA useful for assessing genetic relationships of individuals or groups within a species and also for identifying and quantifying the phylogeny (evolutionary relationships; see phylogenetics) among different species. To do this, biologists determine and then compare the mtDNA sequences from different individuals or species. Data from the comparisons is used to construct a network of relationships among the sequences, which provides an estimate of the relationships among the individuals or species from which the mtDNAs were taken. mtDNA can be used to estimate the relationship between both closely related and distantly related species. Due to the high mutation rate of mtDNA in animals, the 3rd positions of the codons change relatively rapidly, and thus provide information about the genetic distances among closely related individuals or species. On the other hand, the substitution rate of mt-proteins is very low, thus amino acid changes accumulate slowly (with corresponding slow changes at 1st and 2nd codon positions) and thus they provide information about the genetic distances of distantly related species. Statistical models that treat substitution rates among codon positions separately, can thus be used to simultaneously estimate phylogenies that contain both closely and distantly related species\n\nMitochondrial DNA was admitted into evidence for the first time ever in a United States courtroom in 1996 during \"State of Tennessee v. Paul Ware\".\n\nIn the 1998 United States court case of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Patricia Lynne Rorrer, mitochondrial DNA was admitted into evidence in the State of Pennsylvania for the first time. The case was featured in episode 55 of season 5 of the true crime drama series Forensic Files (season 5).\n\nMitochondrial DNA was first admitted into evidence in California, United States, in the successful prosecution of David Westerfield for the 2002 kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old Danielle van Dam in San Diego: it was used for both human and dog identification. This was the first trial in the U.S. to admit canine DNA.\n\nThe remains of King Richard III were identified by comparing his mtDNA with that of two matrilineal descendants of his sister.\n\nMitochondrial DNA was discovered in the 1960s by Margit M. K. Nass and Sylvan Nass by electron microscopy as DNase-sensitive threads inside mitochondria, and by Ellen Haslbrunner, Hans Tuppy and Gottfried Schatz by biochemical assays on highly purified mitochondrial fractions.\n\nSeveral specialized databases have been founded to collect mitochondrial genome sequences and other information. Although most of them focus on sequence data, some of them include phylogenetic or functional information.\n\n\nSeveral specialized databases exist that report polymorphisms and mutations in the human mitochondrial DNA, together with the assessment of their pathogenicity.\n\n"}

In 1925, aged only 20, he moved to Rome to study at Accademia di Belle Arti together with different artists of Scuola romana like Mafai, Omiccioli, Fazzini and Gentilizi; in Rome he had a close friendship with artists and intellectualis like Sarra, Guttuso and Fellini.\n\nNicola Rubino was an exponent of the artistic cultural current called \"Scuola romana\" and of the international sculpture of the 20th century. His works, besides being present in various Italian cities, are exhibited in museums and private collections in Italy and abroad; a valuable collection is kept and exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Alcamo, inside the l'ex Collegio dei Gesuiti.\n\nHis very rich artistic production, from the second half of the 1920s to the beginning of the 1980s, was created inside his study in via Margutta. He liked female figures, that also come back in his paintings realized by Rubino in the last period of his activity, in which he uses a symbolical natural style.\n\nIn 1942 he took part in the fourth Rome Quadriennale and in 1948 into the \"Rassegna d'arte figurativa\" (Exposition of figurative art) of Rome. In 1952 he took part in the fifth Rome Quadriennale and in the XXVI Venice Biennale and his works were then exhibited in foreign countries, among which there were Greece, Turkey and Egypt.\n\nBetween 1953 and 1959 he participated at the \"Mostra d'arte del Mezzogiorno\" (Southern Italy Art Exhibition) of Rome (1953), Naples (1953 and 1954) where he is assigned the prize \"Salvator Rosa\", and then at the \"International Medal Exhibition\" (Palazzo Venezia in Rome). In 1953 they assigned him one of the ten prizes at the contest for the \"monument to the Unknown Political Prisoner\". He took part in the Venice Biennale in 1954 and in he set up a retrospective of medals and exhibited four works at the Rome Quadriennale.\n\nHe also works for private customers (Targioni, Fusi, Lombardo from Rome), and as a teacher at \"Scuole Media\" (first-grade secondary school) and Liceo artistico in Rome.\n\nIn 1956 the Ministry of Transport commissioned him the portal, in Istrian stone, for the Venezia Santa Lucia railway station. In this bas-Relief, six metres high and five large, Rubino has represented instraight lines, the history of Venice through the most important events: the discovery of Saint Mark's corpse, the Republic of Venice, the conquest of Costantinople, the Battle of Lepanto and the Crusades. In 1958 Rubino participated in the \"Premio Internazionale Città di Carrara\" and, in 1959, at the \"International Medal Exhibition\" at the Mint of Bruxelles.\n\nIn the same year he won a contest proclaimed by the Province of Rome and realized a bronze bas-relief for the Technical School \"Maffeo Pantaleoni\" of Rome.\n\nIn 1961 he made the bronze bas-reliefs for the 18th century Porta Palermo (a Gate) in Alcamo, which were commissioned him by the former Lord Mayor Ludovico Corrao and representing \"The poet Cielo d'Alcamo at the court of Federico II\" and \"Active life of Alcamo\".\n\nIn 1963 he took part in the \"Exposition of Figurative Arts\" of Rome and Lazio and, with two of his works, at the Contest Exhibition of Figurative Arts of INPS (National Social Insurance Agency); besides he realized fifteen medals that he showed at the \"International Exhibition of contemporary religious medal\" (Palazzo Braschi in Rome) and five medals at the \"Exposicion de la medalla actual\" of Madrid (1964).\n\nBetween 1964 and 1973 Rubino won 5 competitions and realized the bronze and marble bas-reliefs for the buildings of Lecce, Campobasso, EUR, Rome, Syracuse and Cuneo. The bas-relief at the Inps of Rome represents an idealized vision of work: you can see rural and handcraft life, with a proletarian family in the middle: Rubino wants to intend work as unity and social redemption of it.\n\nIn 1965 he participated, with 5 works, at the IX Rome Quadriennale and exhibited in Paris, nine medals at the Exposition \"La medalle italienne à la Monnale de Paris\". Two years later he presented nine medals at the Exhibition of French, Italian and Spanish Medal (Palazzo Braschi) in Rome.\n\nThen his works were exhibited in Rome in 1972, as a retrospective at the gallery \"Il Camino\", and in 1973 at the \"Club Internazionale dell'Antiquariato\" (Antiques). In 1977 Nicola Rubino showed his pictures, in his first painting retrospective, at the Gallery \"San Marco\" of Rome.\n\nAfter his death in Rome, his wife and two children ordered that some of his works were donated to the municipality of Alcamo, with the obligation of allocating them in the museum inside the Castle of the Counts of Modica; as a whole, la collezione è composta, oltre a 10 tele, di 27 opere, tra gessi e bronzi,the collection is made up, apart 10 paintings, of 27 works (bronzes and plasters) created between the 1950s and 1960s, and testify how Nicola Rubino always tried the naturalness of shape, of movement: the \"dancer”, the “Woman combing herself”, the Pharao’s bather”, the “Mother with a child” are some examples of this.\n\nThere are also the allegorical figures: \"Justice\" (bronze bas-relief openwork), \"Lady Luck\", \"Woman with a dove\" (plasters), \"The winged horse\" (a bronze), and finally, the religious themes, like \"Mater Ecclesiae\" (plaster) and the \" Stations of the Cross\" with four figures (bronze bas-relief).\n\nIn 1999 they entitled the \"Exhibition Room\" of \"Centro Congressi Marconi\" of Alcamo to Nicola Rubino, and on 20 April 2007 they inaugurated the plaster casts gallery, dedicated to the sculptor, inside the Castle of the Counts of Modica di Alcamo, later moved to the Museum of Contemporary Art of Alcamo at the ex Collegio dei Gesuiti.\n\nHis works are characterized by an elegant and linear style; Rubino, in the realization of his sculptures, utilized different materials: plaster, bronze, marble or clay that he was able to model in an admirable way, giving shape to figures which recall the classical world and above all, the hellenic one. \nAs the scholar Gioacchino Aldo Ruggieri affirms, Nicola Rubino can be defined a neoclassical artist because his vision of art is a search for an accomplished beauty, like the one expressed by Canova or Foscolo.\n\nThere is a tight correlation between his sculpture and his painting: according to Franco Miele, Rubino reveals the same ability in modelling a statue or using colour; he is able to express everything with a linear simplicity in both things.\nHis works are exhibited in some galleries (Galleria d'Arte Moderna in Rome, Museo di Roma etc.), and in several private collections too.\n\nSome of his works, realized between the 1950s and 1960s, are exhibited in the plaster cast gallery at the ex Collegio dei Gesuiti in Alcamo; these are the most important:\n\nDancer, marble \n\n\n\n\n"}

Progress achieved by the Office so far includes:\n\n• Greater visibility, political will and momentum than ever before;\n\n• Development of a robust legislative framework in the Security Council, which has given the Office new tools to drive the mandate to the ground and begin to effect some changes in behaviour;\n\n• More strategic and structured engagement with the security and justice sectors, as part of a prevention strategy;\n\n• Beginning to see some accountability at international and national levels, as a vital aspect of deterrence and prevention;\n\n• Beginning to see national ownership, leadership and responsibility, evident in formal commitments that many governments are making to deal with this problem in their countries as well as commitments by regional organizations.\n\nThe three priorities of current SRSG Pramila Patten are:\n\ni. Converting cultures of impunity into cultures of prevention and deterrence through justice and accountability\n\nii. Addressing structural gender-based inequality as the root cause and invisible driver of sexual violence in times of war and peace\n\niii. Fostering national ownership and leadership for a sustainable and holistic survivor-centered response.\n\nAccording to the 2017 Report of the Secretary-General on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence, the Office focuses on 19 country situations, including 13 conflict settings, four post-conflict countries and two additional situations of concern.\n\nThe Office's Team of Experts (TOE) on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict works to strengthen the capacity of national rule of law and justice actors to investigate and prosecute for acts of conflict-related sexual violence. The lack of adequate national capacity to deliver justice often leads to widespread impunity and threatens survivors' access to justice, security and safety. The Team of Experts has been operational since 2011 and is the sole Security Council-mandated body tasked with building national capacity to enhance accountability for conflict-related sexual violence. It includes experts from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which serve as co-lead entities. In addition, the Team is complemented by a law enforcement expert seconded by the Government of Sweden and a reparations expert. Pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1888 (2009), the Team focuses on: (i) working closely with national legal and judicial officials and other personnel in the relevant governments’ civilian and military justice systems to address impunity, including by strengthening national capacity and drawing attention to the full range of justice mechanisms to be considered; (ii) identifying gaps in national response and encouraging a holistic national approach in addressing conflict-related sexual violence, including by enhancing criminal accountability, judicial capacity and responsiveness to victims (such as reparations mechanisms); (iii) making recommendations to coordinate domestic and international efforts and resources to reinforce governments’ ability to address conflict-related sexual violence; and (iv) working with other UN mechanisms including UN Missions, Country Teams, and the SRSG-SVC towards the full implementation of resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), 1960 (2010), 2106 (2013) and 2331 (2016). In line with its mandate, the Team of Experts provides assistance to governments, including in the areas of criminal investigation and prosecution; military justice; legislative reform; protection of victims and witnesses; reparations for survivors; and security sector oversight. In support of the Office of the SRSG-SVC, the TOE also serves a catalytic role in implementing joint communiqués and frameworks of cooperation agreed between the SRSG-SVC and national authorities, regional actors and other UN entities, complementing the work of UN country presences.\n\nUN Action is a cross-UN initiative that unites the work of 14 entities with the goal of ending conflict-related sexual violence. The Chair of UN Action is the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Pramila Patten. Endorsed by the Secretary-General's Policy Committee in June 2007, it represents a concerted effort by the UN to work as one by amplifying advocacy, improving coordination and accountability and supporting country efforts to prevent conflict-related sexual violence and respond effectively to the needs of survivors. The UN Action Secretariat is based in the OSRSG-SVC and focuses on three main pillars:\n\nCountry-level Action: Strategic support to integrated UN Missions to help them design comprehensive strategies to combat conflict-related sexual violence and targeted support to strengthen joint UN programming.\n\nAdvocacy for Action: Raising public awareness and generating political will to address conflict-related sexual violence as part of a broader campaigns to Stop Rape Now and Unite to End Violence Against Women.\n\nLearning by Doing: Creating a knowledge hub on the scale of conflict-related sexual violence and effective responses by the UN and partners.\n\nThe 14 entities in the network are: United Nations Department of Political Affairs (DPA), United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office (UN-PBSO), Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), World Health Organization (WHO), Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\n\nThe Office publishes the Report of the Secretary-General on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence annually to highlight a number of new and emerging concerns in relation to the use of sexual violence by parties to armed conflict as a tactic of war and terrorism. The report contains an annex of a list of parties credibly suspected of committing or being responsible for patterns of rape or other forms of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict, the majority of whom are non-state actors. It tracks developments relevant to the implementation of Resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010) in 19 conflict-affected and post-conflict states and it is compiled through the analysis of data provided by United Nations offices, civil society and regional organizations, as well as Member States. The 2017 Report covers the following countries: Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burundi, Central African Republic, Colombia, Cote d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Iraq, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan (Darfur), Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen.\n\n"}
{"id": "41279760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41279760", "title": "Pain catastrophizing", "text": "Pain catastrophizing\n\nPain catastrophizing is the tendency to describe a pain experience in more exaggerated terms than the average person, to ruminate on it more (e.g., \"I kept thinking 'this is terrible'\"), and/or to feel more helpless about the experience (\"I thought it was never going to get better\"). People who report a large number of such thoughts during a pain experience are more likely to rate the pain as more intense than those who report fewer such thoughts.\n\nIt is generally assumed that the tendency to catastrophize plays a causal role in the pain experience – that is, it \"causes\" the person to experience the pain as more intense. One suggestion is that catastrophizing influences pain perception through altering attention and anticipation, and heightening emotional responses to pain. However, we cannot yet rule out the possibility that at least some aspects of catastrophization may actually be the \"product\" of an intense pain experience, rather than its cause. That is, the more intense the pain feels to the person, the more likely they are to have thoughts about it that fit the definition of catastrophization.\n\nThe components of catastrophizing that are considered primary were long under debate until the development of the pain catastrophizing scale (PCS). The pain catastrophizing scale is a 13-item self-report scale to measure pain catastrophizing created by Michael J. L. Sullivan, Scott R. Bishop and Jayne Pivik. In the PCS, each item is rated on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (all the time). It is broken into three subscales being magnification, rumination, and helplessness. The scale was developed as a self-report measurement tool that provided a valid index of catastrophizing in clinical and non-clinical populations. It is hypothesized that pain catastrophizing is related to various levels of pain, physical disability and psychological disability in clinical and nonclinical populations.\n\n(Note: For the listed items above, (R) Rumination, (M) Magnification, and (H) Helplessness.)\n\nBefore the development of the PCS there had been no other self-report measurement tool that focused primarily on catastrophizing. Other self-report measurement tools such as: the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ), the Pain-Related Self-Statements Scale (PRSS) and the Cognitive Coping Strategy Inventory (CCS) had subscales for assessing catastrophizing but failed to explore specific dimensions of catastrophizing.\n\nStudies of the PCS have generally used a self-report design. Participants are asked about pain experiences in their past; they then rate how well various statements fit their thoughts and feelings at the time. Several such studies have shown the PCS to be invariant, with most accuracy in the three oblique factor structure, across genders and both clinical and non-clinical groups. The gender focused study expressed that female subjects report more frequent experiences of pain, varied intensity with increased persistence, and lower pain tolerances and thresholds. However, it is important to remember that these studies ask participants to report on pain experiences from their past; the overall level of pain experienced is not controlled across genders. If female participants have, on average, experienced more intense and/or persistent pain in their past than male participants, this could also explain their higher endorsement of items relating to pain catastrophizing. Further, more controlled studies are urgently needed to tease apart these issues of cause and effect.\n\nWith minimal modification, to address the subject of the catastrophizing, the PCS can also be applied to pain catastrophizing in a social context. The social aspects studied were parents of disabled children and spouses of individuals with chronic pain. Specifically it has been shown to determine illness related stress and depression issues that arise from parent's catastrophizing about their child's pain in regards to a disability or illness. Similarly with respect to pain catastrophizing between romantic partners, spouse catastrophizing about a partner's chronic pain was related to depressive and pain severity levels in both spouses.\n\nResearch on pain catastrophizing has found that catastrophic thinking is associated with a more intense experience of pain. It is generally believed that the catastrophic thoughts cause the person to experience pain more intensely. This may in turn lead to increased use of health care and longer hospital stays. Following this logic, if the catastrophic thinking can be addressed, then the person's pain experience might also be reduced, which in turn might reduce health care utilization. The use of scales such as the PCS may be useful for measuring pain catastrophizing in these contexts.\n\nThe primary treatment for pain catastrophizing is cognitive behavior therapy for chronic pain. This is typically delivered in individual psychotherapy sessions, or in group pain coping skills classes. These sessions and classes typically span 6 to 12 weeks, and cover a variety of psychobehavioral topics in addition to pain catastrophizing. In 2014, researchers at Stanford University found that a single-session class that they developed specifically to treat pain catastrophizing was effective. However, to date, there have been no studies that meet the usual standards required for medical treatment intervention studies (for example, where patients are randomly allocated to a treatment or an appropriate control condition, and patients are unaware of which condition is expected to be associated with the better outcome).\n"}

Bennington (8 October 1947 – c. 11 July 2009) was a New Zealand museum executive. Bennington served as the chief executive of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, the national museum of New Zealand, from January 2003 until his death in 2009, and had also been the director of the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from 1994 until 2002.\n\nSeddon Bennington was born in Hanmer Springs, North Canterbury, on the South Island of New Zealand. His parents, Charles and Lillian Jean Bennington, reportedly named their son after former New Zealand Prime Minister Richard Seddon, whom they admired for his efforts to benefit working class New Zealanders.\n\nBennington attended Hanmer Springs Primary School, Culverden District High School and Shirley Boys' High School as a student. He credited a teacher at Culverden with introducing him to biology, his favourite subject. An art teacher also took Bennington and other students on a birdwatching trip to Kapiti Island when he was in seventh grade, and the trip left him with a lifelong appreciation for art and nature.\n\nBennington joined the Volunteer Service Abroad in Western Samoa in 1966. He then returned to New Zealand to study across the arts and sciences, and during this time also worked as a teacher. \n\nHe obtained his doctorate in zoology from the University of Canterbury, and also studied a variety of subjects, including New Zealand history, Māori studies, art history and anthropology.\n\nBennington had two sons, Emile and Marcel.\n\nBennington was appointed the head of the Otago Early Settlers' Museum in Dunedin, and then director of the Wellington City Art Gallery, early in his career. He went on to serve as the head of both the Scitech Discovery Centre in Perth, Australia, and the Division of Professional Services at the Western Australian Museum. He authored a book entitled, \"Handbook for Small Museums\", while living and working in Australia.\n\nBennington became the director of the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1994. He is credited with reviving the science center and making the institution financially stable.\n\nBennington joined the Carnegie Science Center at the height of the museum's financial and attendance woes. The museum, which opened a new building in Pittsburgh's North Side in 1991, was suffering from budget deficits and a wavering mission since its opening three years prior to Bennington's arrival.\n\nHe quickly moved to establish a new vision and mission for the Carnegie Science Center. Much of his strategy centred on the establishment and maintenance of institutional relationships between the Science Center and other cultural, scientific and business organisations. He introduced travelling exhibits to the museum, especially through the former UPMC SportsWorks complex.\n\nBennington became a fixture within Pittsburgh's cultural and artistic communities during his nine-year tenure as director of the museum, and volunteered with the city's theatre and art groups.\n\nThe reforms which Bennington brought to the Carnegie Science Center proved popular with the general public. The Carnegie Science Center became the most popular museum of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh during his term as director, and it continues to be the most visited museum of the Carnegie system as of July 2009.\n\nBennington departed the Carnegie Science Museum in late 2002 to become director the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in his native New Zealand.\n\nBennington sought to emphasise and redefine Te Papa's strengths to the public during his six years as the museum's head. He worked with staff to create exhibits which would grab the audience's attention saying, \"I want our exhibitions to be richer in things and richer in information\".\n\nOne of the highlights of Bennington's tenure was the opening of the \"Monet and the Impressionists\" exhibition at Te Papa in early 2009. The travelling exhibit featuring Monet's masterpieces arrived at Te Papa following two years of negotiations with the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts. Bennington noted at the time, \"It's the most significant collection of works by Monet that will ever have come to New Zealand or Australia. It's certainly the most valuable exhibition that has come to New Zealand\".\n\nSeddon Bennington and longtime family friend, Marcella Jackson, 54, disappeared while tramping in the Tararua Range on the North Island of New Zealand on 11 July 2009. Authorities were alerted after the pair failed to return from a weekend of tramping, as hiking is called in New Zealand. They had planned to hike from Otaki Forks to Kime Hut within the Tararua Range, but were caught in a sudden winter southerly storm on Saturday, 11 July, on an exposed section of the Tararuas.\n\nTheir bodies were recovered on 15 July 2009, four days after they went missing. Both had died from hypothermia. Bennington was 61 years old.\n\nA memorial service and funeral for Bennington was held at the Te Papa museum in Wellington. His body was taken to Te Papa's marae on 21 July 2009. \n\nBennington's family members carried his coffin to the entrance of the marae, where it was given to Te Papa staff members who carried it up the stairs accompanied by Māori instrumental music and conch shells. Bennington's casket was then returned to his family at the top of the stairs, to be carried onto the marae.\n\nBennington's coffin was greeted by Te Papa's staff with a haka, and was then placed on a stage in the center of the marae and covered with three kahu kiwi (kiwi feather coats) as a sign of respect. One of the kiwi cloaks had been used for the tangi, or funeral, of former Prime Minister Richard Seddon in 1906. The cloak was significant not only because Bennington was named after the Prime Minister, but also because Bennington had personally accepted the cloak from the Seddon family as a donation to Te Papa. The second cloak was originally from Tuhoe, where Bennington spent time during his younger years. The third kiwi cloak used to cover Bennington's coffin had been used previously to repatriate the remains of New Zealanders who died abroad back to their homeland.\n\nTe Papa spokesperson Jane Keig noted the significance of the kiwi cloaks in Bennington's memorial service, \"Kahu kiwi are very chiefly cloaks.\" She explained that the placing the kahu kiwis over the coffin symbolises, \"keeping the person warm as he starts making his way towards the ancestors.\"\n\nBennington funeral was held on 22 July 2009, at the marae at Te Papa in Wellington.\n"}

In 1949, during the Yangtze Incident, he received the PDSA's Dickin Medal after surviving injuries from a cannon shell, raising morale, and killing off a rat infestation during his service.\n\nSimon was found wandering the dockyards of Hong Kong in March 1948 by 17-year-old Ordinary Seaman George Hickinbottom, a member of the crew of the British frigate HMS \"Amethyst\" stationed in the city in the late 1940s. At this stage, it is thought Simon was approximately a year old, and was very undernourished and unwell. Hickinbottom smuggled the cat aboard ship, and Simon soon ingratiated himself with the crew and officers, particularly because he was adept at catching and killing rats on the lower decks. Simon rapidly gained a reputation for cheekiness, leaving presents of dead rats in sailors' beds, and sleeping in the captain's cap.\n\nThe crew viewed Simon as a lucky mascot, and when the ship's commander changed later in 1948, the outgoing Ian Griffiths left the cat for his successor, Lieutenant Commander Bernard Skinner, who took an immediate liking to the friendly animal. However, Skinner's first mission in command of the \"Amethyst\" was to travel up the Yangtze River to Nanjing to replace the duty ship there, HMS \"Consort\". Halfway up the river the ship became embroiled in the \"Amethyst\" Incident, when Chinese Communist gun batteries opened fire on the frigate. One of the first rounds tore through the captain's cabin, seriously wounding Simon. Lieutenant Commander Skinner died of his wounds soon after the attack.\n\nThe badly wounded cat crawled on deck, and was rushed to the medical bay, where the ship's surviving medical staff cleaned his burns, and removed four pieces of shrapnel, but he was not expected to last the night. He managed to survive, however, and after a period of recovery, returned to his former duties in spite of the indifference he faced from the new captain Lieutenant Commander John Kerans. While anchored in the river, the ship had become overrun with rats, and Simon took on the task of removing them with vigour, as well as raising the morale of the sailors.\n\nFollowing the ship's escape from the Yangtze, Simon became an instant celebrity, lauded in British and world news, and presented with the \"Animal Victoria Cross\", the Dickin Medal; as of 2018, Simon is the only cat to win the award. He was also awarded a Blue Cross medal, the \"Amethyst\" campaign medal, and the fanciful rank of \"Able Seacat\". Thousands of letters were written to him, so much that one Lt. Stewart Hett was appointed \"cat officer\" to deal with Simon's post. At every port \"Amethyst\" stopped at on its route home, Simon was presented with honour, and a special welcome was made for him at Plymouth in November when the ship returned. Simon was, however, like all animals entering the UK, subject to quarantine regulations, and was immediately sent to an animal centre in Surrey.\n\nWhilst in quarantine, Simon contracted a virus and, despite the attentions of medical staff and thousands of well-wishers, died on 28 November 1949 from a complication of the viral infection caused by his war wounds. Hundreds, including the entire crew of HMS \"Amethyst\", attended his funeral at the PDSA Ilford Animal Cemetery in east London. His gravestone reads:\nIN\nMEMORY OF\n\"SIMON\"\nSERVED IN\nH.M.S.

{"id": "51472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51472", "title": "Spore", "text": "Spore\n\nIn biology, a spore is a unit of sexual or asexual reproduction that may be adapted for dispersal and for survival, often for extended periods of time, in unfavourable conditions. Spores form part of the life cycles of many plants, algae, fungi and protozoa. Bacterial spores are not part of a sexual cycle but are resistant structures used for survival under unfavourable conditions. Myxozoan spores release amoebulae into their hosts for parasitic infection, but also reproduce within the hosts through the pairing of two nuclei within the plasmodium, which develops from the amoebula.\n\nSpores are usually haploid and unicellular and are produced by meiosis in the sporangium of a diploid sporophyte. Under favourable conditions the spore can develop into a new organism using mitotic division, producing a multicellular gametophyte, which eventually goes on to produce gametes. Two gametes fuse to form a zygote which develops into a new sporophyte. This cycle is known as alternation of generations.\n\nThe spores of seed plants, however, are produced internally and the megaspores, formed within the ovules and the microspores are involved in the formation of more complex structures that form the dispersal units, the seeds and pollen grains.\n\nThe term \"spore\" derives from the ancient Greek word σπορά \"spora\", meaning \"seed, sowing\", related to σπόρος \"sporos\", \"sowing,\" and σπείρειν \"speirein\", \"to sow.\"\n\nIn common parlance, the difference between a \"spore\" and a \"gamete\" (both together called gonites) is that a spore will germinate and develop into a sporeling, while a gamete needs to combine with another gamete to form a zygote before developing further.\n\nThe main difference between spores and seeds as dispersal units is that spores are unicellular, while seeds contain within them a multicellular gametophyte that produces a developing embryo, the multicellular sporophyte of the next generation. Spores germinate to give rise to haploid gametophytes, while seeds germinate to give rise to diploid sporophytes.\n\nVascular plant spores are always haploid. Vascular plants are either homosporous (or isosporous) or heterosporous. Plants that are homosporous produce spores of the same size and type. \n\nHeterosporous plants, such as seed plants, spikemosses, quillworts, and ferns of the order Salviniales produce spores of two different sizes: the larger spore (megaspore) in effect functioning as a \"female\" spore and the smaller (microspore) functioning as a \"male\". Such plants typically give rise to the two kind of spores from within separate sporangia, either a megasporangium that produces megaspores or a microsporangium that produces microspores. In flowering plants, these sporangia occur within the carpel and anthers, respectively.\n\nFungi commonly produce spores, as a result of sexual, or asexual, reproduction. Spores are always haploid and grow into mature haploid individuals through mitotic division of cells. In multicellular species, the visible fungus is composed entirely of haploid cells. Only during sexual reproduction are diploid cells present, as a result of the fusion of two haloid gamate cells. These diploid cells produce the haploid spores.\n\nSpores can be classified in several ways:\n\nIn fungi and fungus-like organisms, spores are often classified by the structure in which meiosis and spore production occurs. Since fungi are often classified according to their spore-producing structures, these spores are often characteristic of a particular taxon of the fungi.\n\n\n\nSpores can be differentiated by whether they can move or not.\n\nUnder high magnification, spores can be categorized as either monolete spores or trilete spores. In monolete spores, there is a single line on the spore indicating the axis on which the mother spore was split into four along a vertical axis. In trilete spores, all four spores share a common origin and are in contact with each other, so when they separate, each spore shows three lines radiating from a center pole.\n\nEnvelope-enclosed spore tetrads are taken as the earliest evidence of plant life on land, dating from the mid-Ordovician (early Llanvirn, ~), a period from which no macrofossils have yet been recovered.\nIndividual trilete spores resembling those of modern cryptogamic plants first appeared in the fossil record at the end of the Ordovician period.\n\nIn fungi, both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores of many fungal species are actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as travelling through the air over long distances. Many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms as well as spore-surface structures, such as hydrophobins, for spore ejection. These mechanisms include, for example, forcible discharge of ascospores enabled by the structure of the ascus and accumulation of osmolytes in the fluids of the ascus that lead to explosive discharge of the ascospores into the air.\n\nThe forcible discharge of single spores termed \"ballistospores\" involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000 g. Other fungi rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces, exemplified by puffballs. Attracting insects, such as flies, to fruiting structures, by virtue of their having lively colours and a putrid odour, for dispersal of fungal spores is yet another strategy, most prominently used by the stinkhorns.\n\nIn Common Smoothcap moss (\"Atrichum undulatum\"), the vibration of sporophyte has been shown to be an important mechanism for spore release.\n\nIn the case of spore-shedding vascular plants such as ferns, wind distribution of very light spores provides great capacity for dispersal. Also, spores are less subject to animal predation than seeds because they contain almost no food reserve; however they are more subject to fungal and bacterial predation. Their chief advantage is that, of all forms of progeny, spores require the least energy and materials to produce.\n\nIn the spikemoss \"Selaginella lepidophylla\", dispersal is achieved in part by an unusual type of diaspore, a tumbleweed.\n\n"}

The fall-out from the event has contributed to a growing effort to curb gratuitous violence in hockey, and professional sports in general.\n\nSteve Moore was drafted by the Colorado Avalanche in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft in the second round, the 53rd pick overall. Moore played in 69 games for the Avalanche from 2001 to 2004, scoring five goals and seven assists, all of which were scored in the latter season, before being seriously injured by Todd Bertuzzi who at the time played for the Vancouver Canucks (see below). At the time of the incident, the Avalanche were first overall in the NHL standings, and Moore was playing on the Avalanche's top line, on Right Wing, with linemates Joe Sakic (Center), and Paul Kariya (Left Wing).\n\nOn February 16, 2004, during a Vancouver-Colorado game, Moore injured Canucks team captain Markus Näslund with a high hit while Näslund was reaching for a puck through centre ice. Moore contacted Näslund's head in the play. No penalty was called in connection with the hit, but Näslund suffered a concussion and a bone chip in his elbow as a result, and missed three games. After reviewing tapes of the hit, the NHL ruled that the hit was legal and did not fine or suspend Moore. Canucks head coach Marc Crawford and general manager Brian Burke publicly criticized the non-call by the referees on the incident. \n\nDuring the next game between the Canucks and Avalanche held in Denver, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and NHL executive vice-president Colin Campbell attended the game, which ended in a tie and saw no major incidents break out.\n\nHowever, on March 8, 2004, during another rematch between the Avalanche and Canucks, things went differently. In the first period, Moore fought Vancouver player Matt Cooke in a fairly even brawl, and served the 5-minute penalty for fighting. The Avalanche would go on to build up a large lead of 8-2 in a fight-filled game. Late in the third period, Todd Bertuzzi was sent onto the ice. After failing to instigate Moore to fight, Bertuzzi skated after Moore, pulled him back by the jersey and punched him in the back of the head. As Moore fell unconscious to the ice, Bertuzzi's weight and momentum drove Moore's head into the ice. Moore's teammate Andrei Nikolishin and Bertuzzi's teammate Sean Pronger then piled on to Moore and Bertuzzi. Moore was knocked out and lay motionless for ten minutes before being carried off on a stretcher. The combination of the hit, fall, and piling-on had resulted in three fractured neck vertebrae, facial cuts and a concussion.\n\nBertuzzi was assessed a match penalty for his actions, which carries an automatic indefinite suspension under NHL rules. On March 11, 2004, the NHL announced Bertuzzi would remain suspended for at least the remainder of the Canucks' season, including any playoff games. The IIHF subsequently honoured the NHL suspension, preventing Bertuzzi playing in any international tournaments or leagues during the 2004–05 NHL lockout.\n\nOn August 22, 2004, Moore was released from a Denver-area hospital. He wore a neck brace for one year and then started physical therapy for his neck injury and concussion.\n\nOn February 17, 2005, Moore filed a civil lawsuit against Bertuzzi. Also named were Brad May (who was quoted as saying that there would \"definitely be a bounty on Moore's head\" after the game), Brian Burke and the Canucks organization. The lawsuit was thrown out in October 2005, with the judge suggesting that the lawsuit be re-filed in Canada, where the incident took place. The lawsuit was re-filed in Canada, in February 2006.\nOn August 8, 2005, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced that Bertuzzi would be allowed to play again at the start of the 2005–06 NHL season. In the league's decision, they cited many reasons for ending the suspension, such as: \n\nOn August 12, 2005, Brian Burke, formerly Vancouver's general manager who was now serving in the same capacity with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, had made an offer to Moore. It was a two-way contract that would have paid Moore $475,000 US in the NHL and $75,000 if the player suited up for Portland, the Ducks' American Hockey League affiliate. Moore's lawyer Tim Danson described the offer as a self-serving attempt by Burke (who was a defendant in the lawsuit) to mitigate potential legal damages, by attempting to suggest Moore was a minor league player. Further, Danson said that Moore would return to the Avalanche except that Moore was not medically cleared to play hockey, which Brian Burke was well aware of, and described it as adding insult to injury.\n\nOn August 15, 2005, Bertuzzi broke his 17-month-long silence by expressing a desire to move on with his life. \"I'm sure just like Steve Moore and his family, it's been difficult for both parties. I know I wish that day never happened. It's been some tough times, but I've got good family and good friends and good peers in the league that have helped me get over the hump and move forward and come through it.\"\n\nOn November 8, 2005, Moore's Toronto-based lawyer, Tim Danson, said that Moore was skating and doing regular workouts, but continued to suffer concussion-related symptoms. He continued working out for some years afterward, but had to abandon his comeback attempt when it became apparent he would never be medically cleared to return to the ice again.\n\nIn July, 2012, former Avalanche enforcer Scott Parker, who had been a teammate of Moore's very briefly the season prior to the Bertuzzi incident in 2004, made some controversial comments. In an interview with milehighhockey.com, Parker was quoted as saying \"he (Moore) went to Harvard, you know what, blow me. College grad. I never went to college, but I can kick your ass. I'll bring you right down to my IQ level if you want. I'll hit you about four times in the skull, that'll bring you right down.\" \n\nOn February 16, 2006, Moore filed a civil suit in the province of Ontario against Bertuzzi, the Canucks, and the parent company of the Canucks, \"Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment\" for the loss of his NHL career, in his Rookie Year. The lawsuit was seeking $15 million in pecuniary damages for loss of income, $1 million for aggravated damages, and $2 million for punitive damages. Moore's lawyer filed the suit one day before its two-year limitation expired, saying it was because Steve Moore did not want to file the suit and waited until the last minute while he tried to attain medical clearance to resume his career.\n\nBettman attempted to get Bertuzzi and Moore to agree on an out-of-court settlement in the lawsuit filed by Moore. Bertuzzi offered $350,000 to settle the case, an amount which was called \"an insult\" by Moore's lawyer.\n\nOn March 28, 2008, Bertuzzi filed a lawsuit against Crawford, alleging that he was contractually obliged to obey Crawford and that therefore Crawford shares responsibility for the injury to Moore. In response, Crawford later stated that Bertuzzi acted in \"direct disobedience\" to orders from the bench to get off the ice before attacking Moore. On January 14, 2013, The Toronto Star reported that both Moore v. Bertuzzi, et al. and Bertuzzi v. Crawford would begin, after having been postponed several times, in April 2013. Both cases will be held in the Ontario Superior Court before a six-person jury.\n\nOn January 4, 2012, Bertuzzi dropped his third-party lawsuit against Crawford. In the month of October 2013, it was announced that the court date for Moore v. Bertuzzi, et al. will begin on September 8, 2014. On July 2, 2014, Moore's lawsuit was amended, seeking $68 million in damages, up from $38 million. On August 19, 2014, it was announced that an out-of-court settlement had been reached in Steve Moore's lawsuit. Terms of the settlement are confidential.\n\nSteve Moore's older brother Mark, and younger brother, Dominic, all played four years at Harvard University. Because of their relative closeness in age, all three were able to play in the same year for Harvard during the 1999–2000 season. Dominic also went on to play in the NHL.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1821871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821871", "title": "Talat Mahmood", "text": "Talat Mahmood\n\nTalat Mahmood (24 February 1924 – 9 May 1998) is considered one of the greatest male Indian non-classical and semi-classical singers. He was a born singer with an intuitive sense of beauty, charm and grace. He was an Indian playback singer. Although he tried his luck as a film actor, he didn't succeed a great deal in acting.\n\nTalat received Padma Bhushan in 1992, in recognition of his artistic contributions in the spheres of cinematic and ghazal music. he had a unique, elegant and profoundly artistic style of singing. Talat was a very gifted singer in every sense. He was particularly famous for singing soft and sombre semi-classical and non-classical \"ghazal\"s, but the film songs sung by him are also considered critically flawless and outstanding. Although Talat's typical genre was Ghazal, he was an astoundingly brilliant film singer who sung innumerable fantastic film songs.\n\nRomantic and tragic were the moods he liked most and it was he who helped a great deal in shaping the style and method of modern ghazal singing. He can be described as the real founder of modern semi-classical and non-classical ghazal. During the 1950s and 60s, Talat was the first choice of the high-brow literary and artistic community of Indian sub-continent, especially Urdu-speaking community. Even his cancelled songs were immensely popular among them. No other singer had such intellectually high-class and learned audience at the time with an exception of Manna Dey. Talat's voice has often been described as the softest male voice of the Indian sub-continent; not only this, but his voice is also considered among the most soulful male voices ever heard in the Indian sub-continent.\n\nTalat Mahmood was born in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, to Manzoor Mahmood. Talat showed his musical leanings from a very young age and would enjoy sitting through all-night music soirees listening patiently to some of the biggest names in classical Indian music then.\n\nComing from a conservative Muslim background, singing was not encouraged. Talat had to choose between working in films and staying at home. Despite his parental objection he opted for the former, though his family accepted the fact only about a decade later when he gained respect in the industry.\n\nTalat apprenticed classical music under Pandit S.C.R. Bhat at Marris College of Music, Lucknow (presently Bhatkhande Music Institute) some time in late-30s. He started his career purely as a \"ghazal\" singer in 1939. Talat Mahmood began his singing career at the age of 16 in 1939 when he began singing the \"Ghazal\"s of Daag, Mir, Jigar etc. on All India Radio, Lucknow. His voice had a quality distinct from all the other singers. HMV was quick to notice this and offered Talat his first disc in 1941 \"Sab din ek samaan nahin tha, Bun jaoon ga kya se kya main, Iska to kuch dhyan nahin tha\".\n\nHis reputation as a \"ghazal\" singer was not limited to his hometown of Lucknow, but it reached the city that proved to shape his destiny – Calcutta. The then famous \"ghazal\" singers were Ustad Barkat Ali Khan, K.L. Saigal and M.A. Rauf. The classical songs he sang were \" Sapnon Ki Suhaani Duniyaa Ko \" for film Shikast and \" Laage Tose Naina \" for Chaandi Ki Deewar.\n\nIn 1944 came the hit \"Tasveer teri dil mera behela nah sake gi\". Its popularity was so phenomenal and unrivalled that even today it remains one of the top selling non-film discs. This disc brought Talat the fame throughout India and soon he was beckoned by the Calcutta film industry. Talat made cameo appearances and starred in about 16 movies, for both the Calcutta (film hub of the 1940s) and Bombay Film Industry. The three movies in which he starred were regional hits in Calcutta. Initially, in Calcutta, he recorded a lot of Bangla songs (basic album) under the assumed name of \"Tapankumar\". Several of his Bangla numbers were super hits in Bengal and are still aired on All India Radio old song reminisces. He sang to the tune of eminent music directors like Kamal Dasgupta [\" Du'ti paakhi du'ti teere... \"], Sudhin Dasgupta [\" Ei rimjhimjhim barosha... \"], Rabin Chattopadhyayaa [ \" Chander eto aalo... \" ], Hemanta Mukhopadhayay [ \" E Jodi aakash hoy... \" ] and V. Balsara [ \" Tumi sundar jodi nahi... \" ] during the 50s and early 60s.\n\nIn 1949 Talat moved to Bombay, to sing for the Hindi film industry. His name and fame had already preceded him and soon he was flooded with offers. His big break came with the song \"Ae dil mujhe aisi jagha le chal jahan koi na ho\" composed by music director Anil Biswas for the soundtrack of the movie \"Arzoo\". The song proved to be extremely popular.\n\nTalat Mehmood was the real founder of modern semi-classical and non-classical ghazal. So, his influence upon other contemporary and succeeding ghazal singers has been broad and profound. It was he who paved the way for such legendary ghazal singers as \"Mehdi Hassan\" and \"Jagjit Singh\". Hence he will always be placed very high for his contributions to transform and revitalize the whole art and form ghazal singing.\n\nTalat Mehmood can safely be placed among the greatest male gazal and/or film singers of the Indian subcontinent together with the singers like \"K. L. Saigal\", \"Mohammed Rafi\", \"Ahmed Rushdi\", \"Mehdi Hassan\", \"Manna Dey\", \"K. J. Yesudas\", Ustad \"Amanat Ali Khan\", \"Kishore Kumar\", \"Jagjit Singh\", Ustad \"Ghulam Ali\" and \"Mukesh\". Because of his soft and silky voice, subtly intricate and detailed method, correct pronunciation, infallible striking of the notes that are being tried, very sound knowledge of Indian music, striking the right note on the right time, and never missing a single bit of a beat, Talat conquered the souls of countless people throughout the globe, wherever Urdu and Hindi are spoken and understood. He is particularly and immensely popular among learned Urdu-speaking audiences having literary or artistic background, especially in Pakistan.\n\nTalat was a member of the famous male singers' troika of the 1950s who had their respective separate fan-followings throughout the Indian subcontinent, the other two were \"Muhammad Rafi\" and \"Mukesh\".This famous troika was the most popular group of the film singers of the 1950s in the entire sub-continent, who enjoyed the largest audience ever existed during any period of sub-continent's cinematic history. Talat exerted a profound influence upon the ghazal singing of his time with his immensely melodious voice and artistic craftsmanship, particularly suitable for typically semi-classical ghazal singing. He was born to be a Ghazal singer, with his majestic style and brilliant diction he conquered not only the hearts of innumerable high-brow listeners but also common folks of his time. He was the heart-favorite singer of the older and maturer audience of his time, and this type of audience still listens to him more than any of the ghazal singers who ever sung except the Shahenshah-e-Ghazal \"Mehdi Hassan\" and \"Jagjit Singh\". So, in a sense, he still necessarily is a member of another troika, to be more precise, the three most influential ghazal singers of all time.\n\nTalat particularly and profoundly influenced a whole generation of young singers who succeeded him; including legendary ghazal singers \"Jagjit Singh\" and \"Pankaj Udhas\" (who always honors him with the title of Shahenshah-E-Ghazal), singer \"Sajjad Ali\" and playback singer \"Abhijeet Bhattacharya\".\n\nG. M. Durrani was a model to many playback singers who followed then. The soulful renditions of Durrani were to be reminded of by Talat's singing as well.\n\nBesides being a gifted singer, Mahmood was quite handsome as well. He acted in over a dozen films with top actresses of the time like Nutan, Mala Sinha, Suraiya and others. Later he decided to give up acting to concentrate on singing.\n\nTalat acted in the following Hindi films :\n\nThe advent of rock-n-roll in the late 1960s sidelined singers like Talat. As long as he was top box-office draw, the movie producers insisted on including his songs in their movies. Talat's velvety vocals posed a special challenge to the music-composers, most of whom leaned towards the deep baritones of Mohammad Rafi and Mukesh. The resultant demise of his movie career led to the decline of his singing career. At the same time, the social changes and happiness brought about by increasing prosperity in India meant that blue mood ghazals and heart-rending ballads were not popular any more. Talat continued to record good songs, but less in number. His last soundtrack recording, in 1985, is the song \"Mere Shareek-e-Safar\", a duet sung with Miss Hemlata, from the movie \"Wali-e-Azam\" composed by Chitragupt and written by Ahmed Wasi.\n\nHowever, Talat who was the first Indian singer to go on foreign concert tours in 1956 to East Africa found eager fans awaiting his arrival in other foreign countries. Jam packed audience in the United States, the UK, West Indies and other countries awaited his arrival enthusiastically. He performed in famous Royal Albert Hall in London, Madison Square Garden in the States and Jean Pierre Complex in the West Indies. He continued singing in the packed auditoriums until 1991 when he toured Holland. Talat sang about 800 songs in his long career. His songs are still popular among the music lovers as they were in the days these were released.\n\nTalat married a Bengali Christian girl from Calcutta, who also acted in films and was a great fan of his, Latika Mullick, later named Nasreen on 20 February 1951 and had two children Khalid born in 1953 and Sabina born in 1959\n\nPeople, who were close to Talat, describe his nature as a quiet one. He is often remarked as a decent man, and his velvety and silky voice also reflected that decency and sense of calmness. Music directors, who worked with him, claimed that while listening to him, one would develop the feeling that Talat was a soft-hearted man. Dilip Kumar termed Talat as \"a perfect gentleman\". He was a fine gentleman who always had time and respect for his admirers.\n\nTalat sang approximately 800 songs spread over 4 decades spanning between the 40s and 80s. Some of the most popular work of Talat is available even today with the following titles:\n\n\nEven though Talat sang hundreds of hits, some of his most memorable songs from Indian cinema are:\n\n\n"}

A. Bayona and written by Sergio G. Sánchez. It is based on the experience of María Belón and her family in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The cast includes Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor and Tom Holland.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics for its direction and its acting, especially for Watts who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.\n\nMaria Bennett (Naomi Watts), her husband Henry (Ewan McGregor), and their three sons Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) go on a Christmas holiday in 2004 to Khao Lak, Thailand. Arriving on Christmas Eve, they settle in and begin to enjoy the brand new Orchid Beach Resort. Two days later on Boxing Day, the massive 2004 tsunami inundates the area.\n\nMaria and Lucas eventually emerge from the swirling water and find one another, with Maria having sustained serious injuries to her leg and chest. They help a young boy, Daniel, from the wreckage and are soon found by locals who transfer them to a local hospital in the city of Takua Pa. Daniel is separated from them during the journey. At the hospital, Maria encourages Lucas to help others find their family members while she goes into surgery for her chest injuries.\n\nMeanwhile, Henry, Thomas and Simon have also survived and are together. Henry leaves the two boys with another family who head to the mountains for safe shelter while he stays behind to search for Maria and Lucas. While out looking, injured and alone, he is picked up by a passer-by and driven to a nearby bus shelter to wait out with other survivors. Communication facilities are scarce but eventually a tourist named Karl (Sönke Möhring), who has also been separated from his family, lends Henry his cell phone to contact his relatives. Henry promises Maria's father he will look everywhere for his family and that he will find them. Karl tells the group his wife had left him a note confirming they were at the beach, their location when the wave hit. He volunteers to accompany Henry to look for Maria and Lucas and his own family, too.\n\nWhile Maria is in surgery, her medical chart is mixed-up with another patient who has died. Lucas returns to find his mother's bed empty and is then taken to a tent where children without families are kept safe. The mistake is discovered when Lucas cannot identify any of the dead woman's jewelry and he is subsequently reunited with his mother who has been moved to a private room in the ICU. In the hospital while he waits, Lucas finds Daniel who has been reunited with his father.\n\nHenry and Karl search for their families in various places before they arrive at the hospital where Henry is given five minutes to look. Karl gives him a piece of paper with his family members’ names on. The vehicle carrying Thomas and Simon also stops outside the hospital and the boys get off so Simon can urinate. From a distance, Lucas recognizes his father and while searching him out in the chaotic crowd outside, Lucas' brothers spot him and they reunite. Henry finds the three of them together. He learns that Maria is in the hospital ready to undergo more surgery for her leg, which she survives. Flashbacks reveal how she came to be badly injured and how she surfaced the water. While in surgery, Lucas tells his father he has something really important to tell Maria.\n\nThe following day, the family boards an ambulance airplane to Singapore so Maria may receive further medical treatment, arranged by their insurance company. On the plane, Lucas tells his mother he knows Daniel is safe. Maria looks out the window at the chaos left behind.\n\n\nThe film was a co-production of Spanish film companies Apaches Entertainment and Telecinco Cinema, and employed much of the crew from \"The Orphanage\", including the director, writer, production manager, cinematographer, composer, and editor. Principal photography began 23 August 2010, in Alicante, Spain, and continued in October in Thailand.\n\nDirector Juan Antonio Bayona decided not to specify the nationalities of the main characters in order to create a universal film in which nationalities were irrelevant to the plot.\n\nThe tsunami was recreated with a mixture of digital effects and real water surges filmed in slow motion created in a water tank in Spain using miniatures that were destroyed by a huge wave. Bayona committed to working with real water rather than a computer-generated wave because he wanted the story to be authentic. This meant Watts and Holland spent five weeks filming physically and psychologically demanding scenes in a massive water tank. Holland, aged 14 at the time of filming, later described it as a \"scary environment ...You can imagine how tiring and brutal that was.\"\n\n\"The Impossible\" is the second collaboration between Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor after appearing together in the 2005 film \"Stay\".\n\nWarner Bros. released the film in Spain on 11 October 2012. The United States distribution rights were pre-bought by Summit Entertainment. A teaser trailer was released on 26 December 2011. After a full-length English language trailer was released on 20 August 2012, a United States release date of 21 December 2012 was confirmed by Summit. It was released on 11 October 2012 in Spain and in Ireland and the United Kingdom on 1 January 2013. The film was released in the US on 4 January 2013 and was made available by Summit Entertainment through a website streaming the film to members of SAG-AFTRA for consideration of the SAG awards.\n\nIt was released on DVD/Blu-ray in the US and Canada on Tuesday, 23 April 2013, with a European release 13 May 2013.\n\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 81% based on 188 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The screenplay isn't quite as powerful as the direction or the acting, but with such an astonishing real-life story at its center, \"The Impossible\" is never less than compelling.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating to reviews, the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave a perfect four-star rating, praising the performances of Watts and McGregor, and the direction of Bayona. He called it \"one of the best films of the year\".\n\nDeborah Young of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave a very positive review, praising the performances of the two leading stars, stating that \"Watts packs a huge charge of emotion as the battered, ever-weakening Maria whose tears of pain and fear never appear fake or idealised. McGregor, cut and streaked with excessive blood he seems too distraught to wash away, keeps the tension razor-sharp as he pursues his family in a vast, shattered landscape.\" About the film she added, \"\"The Impossible\" is one of the most emotionally realistic disaster movies in recent memory – and certainly one of the most frightening in its epic re-creation of the catastrophic 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\"\n\nJustin Chang of \"Variety\" magazine gave a positive review, praising Bayona's directing and Sánchez's writing: \"Collaborating again after their impressive 2007 debut feature, \"The Orphanage\", Bayona and Sanchez get many things right here, starting with their decision to eschew a more panoramic view of the disaster to follow one family's journey from start to finish.\" About the performances of the main cast members he added, \"Watts has few equals at conveying physical and emotional extremes, something she again demonstrates in a mostly bedridden role, and McGregor, in one of his better recent performances, manages to turn a simple phone call home into a small aria of heartbreak. Holland, in his live-action bigscreen debut, is wonderful as a kind, somewhat short-tempered kid who still has plenty to learn, setting the tone for similarly heartrending turns by young Joslin and Pendergast.\"\nDamon Wise of \"The Guardian\" gave the film four stars out of five. He also praised the performances, stating that \"as Maria, Watts is both brave and vulnerable, and her scenes with the young Lucas (the excellent Tom Holland) are among the film's best, with adult and child now unexpected equals, the mother humbled, the son rising to the challenge. McGregor, meanwhile, gives one of his best performances as the sad and desperate Henry, trying to play the hero, the provider, while knowing his cause is almost certainly lost.\" About the film, he added: \"Part of the appeal of this affecting and powerful drama is that it puts the viewer right in the moment at every stage, using authentic locations and tsunami survivors to hammer home the reality of this tragedy.\"\n\nEric Kohn of \"IndieWire\" gave the film a \"B-\" grade and stated that the film \"suffers from the greater problem of emphasising a feel-good plot within the context of mass destruction.\"\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times\" reviewer A. O. Scott, this narrowly-defined cinematic framing of the disaster through European and not Thai lenses represents \"a troubling complacency and a lack of compassion in \"The Impossible\",\" a movie which he found to be \"less an examination of mass destruction than the tale of a spoiled holiday.\"\n\nSimon Jenkins, a British survivor from Portsmouth, wrote to \"The Guardian\", stating the film is \"beautifully accurate\". This was in response to critics commenting that the film is \"overdramatic\" and \"whitewashed\". He says of the comments, \"As I must, I've never been the sort of person to revisit and analyse events of the past, but some of these articles frustrated me. Had this film been purely about the tale of a western middle class family's 'ruined' holiday then I would have agreed. For me, it was the exact opposite. Rather than concentrating on the 'privileged white visitors', the film portrayed the profound sense of community and unity that I experienced in Thailand, with this family at the centre of it. Both for my (then) 16-year-old self and the Belón family, it was the Thai people who waded through the settled water after the first wave had struck to help individuals and families... The Thai people had just lost everything – homes, businesses, families – yet their instinct was to help the tourists.\"\n\nSupport UK, a support group for survivors of the tsunami, lobbied to have the trailer screened with a warning notice beforehand. A spokesman for Odeon Cinemas stated that it had no control over the content of the BBFC-approved trailer, saying, \"We can only apologise for any offence caused on this occasion.\"\n\n\"The Impossible\" was a box office success. In Spain the film was released on 11 October 2012, and opened in 638 cinemas, grossing $11,569,306 on its opening weekend, ranking No. 1 with a per-cinema average of $18,134, the highest-grossing opening weekend for a film in Spain. On its second weekend the film remained at No. 1 and grossed $9,016,065 with a per-cinema average of $14,022. On its third weekend it remained at No. 1 and made $5,768,184 with a per-cinema average of $9,098. The film ended up earning $54,536,668 at the Spanish box office and $180,274,123 worldwide, compared with its estimated $45 million production budget.\n\n\n"}

As a concept, Forward Engagement draws heavily on the fields of Futures Studies and Complex Systems Research. \n\nForward Engagement asserts: (1) that major social change is accelerating at a rate fast enough to challenge the adaptive capacity of whole societies; (2) that governments ought to address such possibilities as far in advance as possible; and (3) that there needs to be a system to help governments visualize more consistently what may be approaching in order to deliberate sufficiently about responses. \n\nFurther, Forward Engagement makes the proposition that there has been a shift in the nature of the major problems societies face: they increasingly interact with other problems, blur the lines between foreign and domestic, produce unplanned consequences, and mutate into new problems as parts of continuing processes. Such \"complex\" societal problems call for interdisciplinary and anticipatory approaches to problem solving. \n\nForward Engagement has been the subject of a project funded by the George Washington University and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and directed by Leon Fuerth since 2001.

Digges' treatise had been leaked to the Earl of Leicester shortly before the attempted Spanish invasion of England in 1588.\n\nWhen the fear of a French invasion was imminent, Adamson, who hailed from Lancashire, edited this tract with additions of his own, giving an account of ‘such stores of war and other materials as are requisite for the defence of a fort, a train of artillery, and for a magazine belonging to a field army;..’ adding also a list: (1) of the ships of war, (2) of the governors of the garrisons of England, (3) of the lord-lieutenants and high sheriffs of the counties adjacent to the coasts; and concluding his tract by a statement of the wages paid per month to the officers and seamen in the fleet.\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes that Adamson feared a French invasion would be supported by English Catholics and that he expressed the view that the people of England should take action against any such invasion - even to the point of deposing governors of garrisons should this be necessary.

Why Can't We?\" Firms began reexamining the techniques of quality control invented over the past 50 years and how those techniques had been so successfully employed by the Japanese. It was in the midst of this economic turmoil that TQM took root.\n\nThe exact origin of the term \"total quality management\" is uncertain. It is almost certainly inspired by Armand V. Feigenbaum's multi-edition book \"Total Quality Control\" () and Kaoru Ishikawa's \"What Is Total Quality Control? The Japanese Way\" (). It may have been first coined in the United Kingdom by the Department of Trade and Industry during its 1983 \"National Quality Campaign\". Or it may have been first coined in the United States by the Naval Air Systems Command to describe its quality-improvement efforts in 1985.\n\nIn the spring of 1984, an arm of the United States Navy asked some of its civilian researchers to assess statistical process control and the work of several prominent quality consultants and to make recommendations as to how to apply their approaches to improve the Navy's operational effectiveness. The recommendation was to adopt the teachings of W. Edwards Deming. The Navy branded the effort \"Total Quality Management\" in 1985.\n\nFrom the Navy, TQM spread throughout the US Federal Government, resulting in the following:\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency's Underground Storage Tanks program, which was established in 1985, also employed Total Quality Management to develop its management style. The private sector followed suit, flocking to TQM principles not only as a means to recapture market share from the Japanese, but also to remain competitive when bidding for contracts from the Federal Government since \"total quality\" requires involving suppliers, not just employees, in process improvement efforts.\n\nThere is no widespread agreement as to what TQM is and what actions it requires of organizations, however a review of the original United States Navy effort gives a rough understanding of what is involved in TQM.\n\nThe key concepts in the TQM effort undertaken by the Navy in the 1980s include:\n\nThe Navy used the following tools and techniques:\n\nWhile there is no generally accepted definition of TQM, several notable organizations have attempted to define it. These include:\n\n\"Total Quality Management (TQM) in the Department of Defense is a strategy for continuously improving performance at every level, and in all areas of responsibility. It combines fundamental management techniques, existing improvement efforts, and specialized technical tools under a disciplined structure focused on continuously improving all processes. Improved performance is directed at satisfying such broad goals as cost, quality, schedule, and mission need and suitability. Increasing user satisfaction is the overriding objective. The TQM effort builds on the pioneering work of Dr. W. E. Deming, Dr. J. M. Juran, and others, and benefits from both private and public sector experience with continuous process improvement.\"\n\n\"A management philosophy and company practices that aim to harness the human and material resources of an organization in the most effective way to achieve the objectives of the organization.\"\n\n\"A management approach of an organisation centred on quality, based on the participation of all its members and aiming at long term success through customer satisfaction and benefits to all members of the organisation and society.\"\n\n\"A term first used to describe a management approach to quality improvement. Since then, TQM has taken on many meanings. Simply put, it is a management approach to long-term success through customer satisfaction. TQM is based on all members of an organization participating in improving processes, products, services and the culture in which they work. The methods for implementing this approach are found in the teachings of such quality leaders as Philip B. Crosby, W. Edwards Deming, Armand V. Feigenbaum, Kaoru Ishikawa and Joseph M. Juran.\"\n\n\"TQM is a philosophy for managing an organisation in a way which enables it to meet stakeholder needs and expectations efficiently and effectively, without compromising ethical values.\"\n\nIn the United States, the Baldrige Award, created by Public Law 100-107, annually recognizes American businesses, education institutions, health care organizations, and government or nonprofit organizations that are role models for organizational performance excellence. Organizations are judged on criteria from seven categories:\n\nExample criteria are:\n\nJoseph M. Juran believed the Baldrige Award judging criteria to be the most widely accepted description of what TQM entails.\n\nDuring the 1990s, standards bodies in Belgium, France, Germany, Turkey, and the United Kingdom attempted to standardize TQM. While many of these standards have since been explicitly withdrawn, they all are effectively superseded by ISO 9000:\n\nInterest in TQM as an academic subject peaked around 1993.\n\nThe Federal Quality Institute was shuttered in September 1995 as part of the Clinton administration's efforts to streamline government. The European Centre for Total Quality Management closed in August 2009, a casualty of the Great Recession.\n\nTQM as a vaguely defined quality management approach was largely supplanted by the ISO 9000 collection of standards and their formal certification processes in the 1990s. Business interest in quality improvement under the TQM name also faded as Jack Welch's success attracted attention to Six Sigma and Toyota's success attracted attention to Lean manufacturing, though the three share many of the same tools, techniques, and significant portions of the same philosophy.\n\nTQM lives on in various national quality awards around the globe.\n\nThe social scientist Bettina Warzecha (2017) describes the central concepts of Quality Management (QM), such as e.g. process orientation, controllability, and zero defects as modern myths. She demonstrates that zero-error processes and the associated illusion of controllability involve the epistemological problem of self-referentiality. The emphasis on the processes in QM also ignores the artificiality and thus arbitrariness of the difference between structure and process. Above all, the complexity of management cannot be reduced to standardized (mathematical) procedures. According to her, the risks and negative side effects of QM are usually greater than the benefits (see also \"brand eins\", 2010).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "285313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=285313", "title": "Ubuntu philosophy", "text": "Ubuntu philosophy\n\nUbuntu () is a Nguni Bantu term meaning \"humanity\". It is often translated as \"I am because we are,\" and also \"humanity towards others\", but is often used in a more philosophical sense to mean \"the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity\".\n\nIn Southern Africa, it has come to be used as a term for a kind of humanist philosophy, ethic, or ideology, also known as \"Ubuntuism\" propagated in the Africanisation (transition to majority rule) process of these countries during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nSince the transition to democracy in South Africa with the Nelson Mandela presidency in 1994, the term has become more widely known outside of Southern Africa, notably popularised to English-language readers through the ubuntu theology of Desmond Tutu. Tutu was the chairman of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), and many have argued that \"ubuntu\" was a formative influence on the TRC. However, this view is challenged and contextualized by Christian B. N. Gade in \"A Discourse on African Philosophy: A New Perspective on Ubuntu and Transitional Justice in South Africa\". One of Gade's key findings is that former TRC commissioners and committee members question the importance of \"ubuntu\" in the TRC process. Another is that there are several differing and historically developing interpretations of \"ubuntu\", some of which have evident political implications and reflect non-factual and creative uses of history.\n\nThe term \"ubuntu\" appears in South African sources from as early as the mid-19th century. Reported translations covered the semantic field of \"human nature, humanness, humanity; virtue, goodness, kindness\". Grammatically, the word combines the root \"-ntʊ̀\" \"person, human being\" with the class 14 \"ubu-\" prefix forming abstract nouns, so that the term is exactly parallel in formation to the abstract noun \"humanity\".\n\nThe concept was popularised in terms of a \"philosophy\" or \"world view\" (as opposed to a quality attributed to an individual) beginning in the 1950s, notably in the writings of Jordan Kush Ngubane published in the \"African Drum\" magazine.\nFrom the 1970s, the \"ubuntu\" began to be described as a specific kind of \"African humanism\". Based on the context of Africanisation propagated by the political thinkers in the 1960s period of decolonisation, \n\"ubuntu\" was used as a term for a specifically African (or Southern African) kind of humanism found in the context of the transition to black majority rule in Zimbabwe and South Africa.\nThe first publication dedicated to \"ubuntu\" as a philosophical concept appeared in 1980, \"Hunhuism or Ubuntuism: A Zimbabwe Indigenous Political Philosophy\" (\"hunhu\" being the Shona equivalent of Nguni \"ubuntu\") by Stanlake J. W. T. Samkange. Hunhuism or Ubuntuism is presented as political ideology for the new Zimbabwe, as Southern Rhodesia was granted independence from the United Kingdom. \n\nFrom Zimbabwe, the concept was taken over in South Africa in the 1990s as a guiding ideal for the transition from apartheid to majority rule.\nThe term appears in the Epilogue of the Interim Constitution of South Africa (1993), \"there is a need for understanding but not for vengeance, a need for reparation but not for retaliation, a need for \"ubuntu\" but not for victimisation\".\n\nThere are many different, and not always compatible, definitions of what ubuntu is (for a survey of how ubuntu is defined among South Africans see Gade 2012: \"What is Ubuntu? Different Interpretations among South Africans of African Descent\"). \nUbuntu asserts that society, not a transcendent being, gives human beings their humanity. An example is a Zulu-speaking person who when commanding to speak in Zulu would say “\"khuluma isintu\",” which means \"speak the language of people\". When someone behaves according to custom, a Sotho-speaking person would say “\"ke motho\",” which means \"he/she is a human\". The exclusionary and abhorrent aspect of this would be exemplified by a tale told (often, in private quarters) in Nguni “\"kushone abantu ababili ne Shangaan\"”, in Sepedi “\"go tlhokofetje batho ba babedi le leShangane\"”, in English (two people died and one Shangaan). In each of these examples, humanity comes from conforming to or being part of the tribe.\n\nAccording to Michael Onyebuchi Eze, the core of ubuntu can best be summarised as follows: \n\n'A person is a person through other people' strikes an affirmation of one’s humanity through recognition of an ‘other’ in his or her uniqueness and difference. It is a demand for a creative intersubjective formation in which the ‘other’ becomes a mirror (but only a mirror) for my subjectivity. This idealism suggests to us that humanity is not embedded in my person solely as an individual; my humanity is co-substantively bestowed upon the other and me. Humanity is a quality we owe to each other. We create each other and need to sustain this otherness creation. And if we belong to each other, we participate in our creations: we are because you are, and since you are, definitely I am. The ‘I am’ is not a rigid subject, but a dynamic self-constitution dependent on this otherness creation of relation and distance.\n\nAn \"extroverted communities\" aspect is the most visible part of this ideology. There is sincere warmth with which people treat both strangers and members of the community. This overt display of warmth is not merely aesthetic but enables formation of spontaneous communities. The resultant collaborative work within these spontaneous communities transcends the aesthetic and gives functional significance to the value of warmth. How else are you to ask for sugar from your neighbour? Warmth is not the sine qua non of community formation but guards against instrumentalist relationships. Unfortunately, sincere warmth may leave one vulnerable to those with ulterior motives.\n\n\"Ubuntu\" as political philosophy has aspects of socialism, propagating the redistribution of wealth. This is similar to redistributive policies in liberalism. This socialisation is a vestige of agrarian peoples as a hedge against the crop failures of individuals. Socialisation presupposes a community population with which individuals empathise and concomitantly, have a vested interest in its collective prosperity. Urbanisation and the aggregation of people into an abstract and bureaucratic state undermines this empathy. African Intellectual historians like Michael Onyebuchi Eze have argued however that this ideal of \"collective responsibility\" must not be understood as absolute in which the community's good is prior to the individual's good. On this view, ubuntu it is argued, is a communitarian philosophy that is widely differentiated from the Western notion of communitarian socialism. In fact, ubuntu induces an ideal of shared human subjectivity that promotes a community's good through an unconditional recognition and appreciation of individual uniqueness and difference Audrey Tang has suggested that Ubuntu \"implies that everyone has different skills and strengths; people are not isolated, and through mutual support they can help each other to complete themselves.\"\n\n\"Redemption\" relates to how people deal with errant, deviant and dissident members of the community. The belief is that man is born formless like a lump of clay. It is up to the community, as a whole, to use the fire of experience and the wheel of social control to mould him into a pot that may be of general use. Any imperfections should be borne by the community and the community should always seek to redeem man. An example of this is the statement by the African National Congress (in South Africa) that it does not throw out its own but rather redeems. A possible limitation of this is that not all clay is the same and not all tools are pots or of general use. Likewise, not all people are the same or similar, and not all people are fated to have the same or similar function.\n\nIn the Shona language, the majority spoken language in Zimbabwe, ubuntu is \"unhu\". The concept of ubuntu is viewed the same in Zimbabwe as in other African cultures, and the Zulu saying is also common in Shona: \"munhu munhu nekuda kwevanhu\".\n\nStanlake J. W. T. Samkange (1980) highlights the three maxims of Hunhuism or Ubuntuism that shape this philosophy: The first maxim asserts that 'To be human is to affirm one's humanity by recognizing the humanity of others and, on that basis, establish respectful human relations with them.' And 'the second maxim means that if and when one is faced with a decisive choice between wealth and the preservation of the life of another human being, then one should opt for the preservation of life'. The third 'maxim' as a 'principle deeply embedded in traditional African political philosophy' says 'that the king owed his status, including all the powers associated with it, to the will of the people under him'.\n\nWhile sharing is incorporated within \"unhu\", it is only one of the multiplicity of virtues within \"unhu\". In the \"unhu\" domain, visitors do not need to burden themselves with carrying provisions – all they need is to dress properly and be on the road. All visitors are provided for and protected in every home they pass through without payment being expected. In fact, every individual should try his or her best to make visitors comfortable – and this applies to everyone who is aware of the presence of a visitor within a locality.\n\nOther manifestations of ubuntu are that it is taboo to call elderly people by their given names; instead they are called by their surnames. This has the effect of banishing individualism and replacing it with a representative role, in which the individual effectively stands for the people among whom he comes from at all times. The individual identity is replaced with the larger societal identity within the individual. Thus, families are portrayed or reflected in the individual and this phenomenon is extended to villages, districts, provinces and regions being portrayed in the individual. This places high demands on the individual to behave in the highest standards and to portray the highest possible virtues that society strives for. \"Unhu\" embodies all the invaluable virtues that society strives for towards maintaining harmony and the spirit of sharing among its members.\n\nA key concept associated with \"unhu\" is how we behave and interact in our various social roles, e.g., daughters-in-law traditionally kneel down when greeting their parents-in-law and serve them food as a sign of respect and maintain the highest standards of behaviour that will be extended or reflected to her family and all the women raised in that family. The daughter-in-law does this as part of the ambassadorial function that she plays and assumes at all times. However, this does not apply only to daughters-in-law but to all women in general, even among friends and equals such as brother and sister.\n\nUnder \"unhu\" children are never orphans since the roles of mother and father are by definition not vested in a single individual with respect to a single child. Furthermore, a man or a woman with \"unhu\" will never allow any child around them to be an orphan.\n\nThe concept of \"unhu\" also constitutes the kernel of African Traditional Jurisprudence as well as leadership and governance. In the concept of unhu, a crime committed by one individual on another extends far beyond the two individuals and has far-reaching implications to the people from among whom the perpetrator of the crime comes. Unhu jurisprudence tends to support remedies and punishments that tend to bring people together. For instance, a crime of murder would lead to the creation of a bond of marriage between the victim's family and the accused's family in addition to the perpetrator being punished both inside and outside his social circles. The role of \"tertiary perpetrator\" to the murder crime is extended to the family and the society where the individual perpetrator hails from. However, the punishment of the tertiary perpetrator is a huge fine and a social stigma, which they must shake off after many years of demonstrating \"unhu\" or \"ubuntu\". A leader who has \"unhu\" is selfless and consults widely and listens to subjects. Such a person does not adopt a lifestyle that is different from the subjects, but lives among them and shares property. A leader who has \"unhu\" does not lead, but allows the people to lead themselves and cannot impose his will on his people, which is incompatible with \"unhu\".\n\nUbuntu: \"I am what I am because of who we all are.\" (From a definition offered by Liberian peace activist Leymah Gbowee.)\n\nArchbishop Desmond Tutu offered a definition in a 1999 book:\nTutu further explained Ubuntu in 2008:\nNelson Mandela explained Ubuntu as follows:\nTim Jackson refers to Ubuntu as a philosophy that supports the changes he says are necessary to create a future that is economically and environmentally sustainable.\n\nJudge Colin Lamont expanded on the definition during his ruling on the hate speech trial of Julius Malema:\n\nAt Nelson Mandela's memorial, United States President Barack Obama spoke about Ubuntu, saying,\n\nIn Malawi, the same philosophy is called \"uMunthu\". \nAccording to the Catholic Diocese of Zomba bishop Rt. Rev. Fr. Thomas Msusa, “The African worldview is about living as one family, belonging to God”. \nMsusa noted that in Africa “We say ‘I am because we are’, or in Chichewa \"kali kokha nkanyama, tili awiri ntiwanthu\" (when you are on your own you are as good as an animal of the wild; when there are two of you, you form a community).”\n\nThe philosophy of uMunthu has been passed on through proverbs such as \"Mwana wa mnzako ngwako yemwe, ukachenjera manja udya naye\" (your neighbor's child is your own, his/her success is your success too). Some notable Malawian uMunthu philosophers and intellectuals who have written about this worldview are Augustine Musopole, Gerard Chigona, Chiwoza Bandawe, Richard Tambulasi, Harvey Kwiyani and Happy Kayuni. This includes Malawian philosopher and theologist Harvey Sindima’s treatment of uMunthu as an important African philosophy is highlighted in his 1995 book ‘Africa’s Agenda: The legacy of liberalism and colonialism in the crisis of African values’.\nIn film, the English translation of the proverb lent its hand to forming the title of Madonna's documentary, \"I Am Because We Are\" about Malawian orphans.\n\nIn June 2009, in her swearing-in remarks as US Department of State Special Representative for Global Partnerships, Global Partnership Initiative, Office of the Secretary of State (served 18 June 2009 – 10 October 2010), Elizabeth Frawley Bagley discussed ubuntu in the context of American foreign policy, stating: \"In understanding the responsibilities that come with our interconnectedness, we realize that we must rely on each other to lift our World from where it is now to where we want it to be in our lifetime, while casting aside our worn out preconceptions, and our outdated modes of statecraft.\" She then introduced the notion of \"Ubuntu Diplomacy\" with the following words:\n\nUbuntu was a major theme in John Boorman's 2004 film \"In My Country\".\nFormer US president Bill Clinton used the term at the 2006 Labour Party conference in the UK to explain why society is important.\nThe Boston Celtics, the 2008 NBA champions, have chanted \"ubuntu\" when breaking a huddle since the start of the 2007–2008 season.\n\nAt the 2002 UN World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), there was an Ubuntu Village exposition centre. Ubuntu was the theme of the 76th General Convention of the American Episcopal Church. The logo includes the text \"I in You and You in Me\".\n\nIn October 2004 Mark Shuttleworth, a South African entrepreneur and owner of UK based company Canonical Ltd., founded the Ubuntu Foundation that is the company behind the creation of a computer operating system based on Debian Linux. He named the Linux distribution Ubuntu.\n\nIn film, the English translation of the proverb lent its hand to forming the title of pop singer Madonna's documentary, \"I Am Because We Are\" about Malawian orphans.\n\nA character in the 2008 animated comedy \"The Goode Family\" is named Ubuntu.\n\nUbuntu was the title and theme of an EP released by British band Clockwork Radio in 2012.\n\n\n\n"}

Long recognized for its size, the Webster Sycamore was the largest living American sycamore tree in West Virginia until its felling in 2010. The tree stood approximately east of Webster Springs in Webster County, in a moist flood plain along the banks of the Back Fork Elk River, a tributary stream of the Elk River.\n\nThe Webster Sycamore reached a tree height measurement of , a tree crown measurement of , and a circumference of at breast height. In 1955, the American Forests Association declared the tree the largest of its species in the United States. It only held the title for three weeks, before the association identified a larger American sycamore in Maryland. Despite losing its national title, the sycamore remained the largest American sycamore in West Virginia. Following a 1963 survey of large trees in West Virginia, the Webster Sycamore was named the second-largest tree after a white oak (\"Quercus alba\") in Randolph County.\n\nThe land upon which the Webster Sycamore was located was owned by the Pardee and Curtin Lumber Company, which spared the tree during its lumber operations in the area during the 1950s. West Virginia University biologist W. H. Gillespie averred that the tree stood as \"a memorial of the original virgin forest\". The Pardee and Curtin Lumber Company preserved the land surrounding the tree as a park, known as Big Sycamore Park. During the annual events Webster Wildwater Weekend in April and the Webster County Nature Weekend in May, hiking excursions were led to the Webster Sycamore.\n\nOn September 3, 2007, a malicious fire was set in the base of the Webster Sycamore's trunk. The tree survived the blaze, but suffered irreparable damage. The West Virginia Division of Forestry performed a safety and risk assessment of the tree, and determined that structural mitigation was not feasible, and that the Webster Sycamore was to be \"considered an extreme hazard\". In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from Bergoo was formally charged with a felony count of arson for setting fire to the tree. Following the fire, experts recommended that the Webster Sycamore be felled or fenced off as a safety measure. According to the Division of Forestry, the tree was finally brought down during the summer of 2010. At the time of its death, the tree was estimated to be over 500 years old.\n\nPrior to the arrival of European American settlers and explorers, the Allegheny Mountain Range of the Appalachian Mountains was overlaid with old-growth forests consisting predominantly of deciduous hardwood trees, which were characterized by individual trees of enormous size and girth. The American sycamore (\"Platanus occidentalis\") was one of the species of trees that proliferated throughout these old-growth forests. American sycamores can grow at least in height and the species is distributed throughout the Eastern United States. It usually thrives in moist soils along streams, especially in sandy loam soils. American sycamores are a dominant species in bottomland and riparian forests. The species is present throughout every county in West Virginia, and is most abundant along the state's streams.\n\nFormerly West Virginia's largest American sycamore, the Webster Sycamore (alternatively known as the Webster Springs Sycamore and the Big Sycamore Tree) was located in a moist flood plain along the banks of the Back Fork Elk River, a tributary stream of the Elk River, in Webster County. The tree was located approximately east of Webster Springs.\n\nVarious measurements were taken of the tree during the latter part of its lifetime; however, measurements of the circumference differ. In 1955, the tree's circumference at breast height, when measured from the ground, was . At a tree fork from the ground, its trunk measured in diameter. The trunk stood to a height of , where it had been decapitated by a previous windstorm. The tree's horizontal canopy spread measured approximately in width. The lowest limb of the sycamore was from the ground, and measured in diameter. According to official measurements in 1963, however, the diameter at breast height of the Webster Sycamore, when measured from the ground, was more than and its circumference measured . The sycamore was estimated to be at least in height. Its trunk measured approximately in diameter when measured from the forest floor.\n\nAccording to the West Virginia Division of Forestry and West Virginia Humanities Council in 2002 and the West Virginia Big Tree Program in 2011, the Webster Sycamore was the largest American sycamore in West Virginia, with a height of , a tree crown measurement of , and a circumference of at breast height.\n\nBy the time of its felling in 2010, the Webster Sycamore was estimated to be over 500 years in age.\n\nIn 1955, an eastern hemlock (\"Tsuga canadensis\") measuring in height grew from a rotten knothole in the tree's main south fork. By 1963, the hemlock that had taken root in the tree's south fork remained. In describing the growth of the hemlock from an upper tree fork of the Webster Sycamore, writer William C. Blizzard referenced the idiom of Pelion piled upon Ossa. No tree hollows or visible outer blemishes were reported on the sycamore at that time; however, by 2007, the tree's trunk had developed an opening into its hollow center at its base, which allowed visitors to step inside of it.\n\nThe Webster Sycamore had long been a local landmark on account of its age and size, and was known locally as being the world's largest American sycamore. By 1920, author Edwin Lincoln Mosely had included an image and a brief description of a similar American sycamore near Webster Springs – probably the Webster Sycamore – in his book \"Trees, Stars and Birds: A Book of Outdoor Science\".\n\nIt was in 1955 that the tree won recognition from the American Forests Association as the largest tree of its species in the United States. It only held the title for three weeks before a larger American sycamore in Maryland was discovered and recognized by the association. Despite losing its national title, the sycamore remained the largest American sycamore in West Virginia.\n\nDuring the West Virginia Centennial \"big-tree contest\" of 1963, the honorific of the state's largest tree went to a white oak (\"Quercus alba\") near Huttonsville in Randolph County, thus beating out the Webster Sycamore. The white oak measured in diameter. An elm (\"Ulmus\") tree in Putnam County also bested the Webster Sycamore at in diameter.\n\nDuring a speech to the United States Senate in honor of West Virginia Day on June 20, 2004, U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd mentioned the Webster Sycamore while boasting of \"the biggest and best of West Virginia\".\n\nThe land upon which the Webster Sycamore was located was owned by the Purdee and Curtin Lumber Company of nearby Webster Springs. The company spared the tree in the 1950s, during its lumber operations in the area. According to West Virginia University biologist W. H. Gillespie in \"Castanea\", the tree stood as \"a memorial of the original virgin forest\". The Purdee and Curtin Lumber Company preserved the land surrounding the tree as a park, known as Big Sycamore Park. The park was utilized by campers, and by tourists visiting the tree. A swinging bridge across the Back Fork of Elk River provided access to the tree and the park.\n\nIn 2002, the Webster Sycamore was one of five trees nominated by the West Virginia Humanities Council to the National Register of Historic Trees, a registry of historic trees maintained by the American Forests Historic Tree Nursery.\n\nDuring the annual events Webster Wildwater Weekend in April and the Webster County Nature Weekend in May, hiking excursions were led to the Webster Sycamore, in addition to the nearby Three Falls of Back Fork.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 3, 2007, a malicious fire was set in the base of the Webster Sycamore's trunk. The fire burned up through the hollow center of the tree's hollow bole. The Webster Springs Fire Department, Webster County Sheriff's Department, and the West Virginia Division of Forestry provided a joint response to the fire, and remained on the scene for several hours until the flames were out. The tree survived the blaze but suffered irreparable damage.\n\nInitially following the fire, the tree's vicinity was closed for the investigation and for an assessment of the extent of damage and safety risk. On September 27, 2007, the West Virginia Division of Forestry's urban forestry coordinator Bob Hannah and technical specialist Jennifer Brashears engaged in an inspection and evaluation of the tree to provide recommendations. In their report, Hannah and Brashears assessed that the tree's \"severe structural weakness\" was not caused by the fire, and instead highlighted the tree's \"size, age, and severity of defects\" as the cause of its instability. They did, however, assess that the fire may have caused further mortality of the tree's cambium. They used various measurements developed by the International Society of Arboriculture and the United States Forest Service to formulate a tree risk assessment. At the time of their investigation, the tree's diameter at breast height was , with 27% of the trunk consisting of open space. Hannah and Brashears also found that one-third of the lower trunk and root crown demonstrated callus formation and no new growth, but instead severe decay and peeling bark. Hannah and Brashears further determined that structural mitigation was not feasible, and that the Webster Sycamore was to be \"considered an extreme hazard\" and the public should be \"excluded from its striking zone through fencing and signage\".\n\nThe investigation into the fire was led by the Division of Forestry's chief investigator, Sam Butcher. The investigation lasted four months, and once a suspect had been identified, the case was turned over to the Webster County prosecuting attorney's office. Butcher credited Art Yagel, a Division of Forestry investigator, for bringing the investigation to its conclusion. In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from Bergoo was formally charged with a felony count of arson for setting fire to the tree, while a second juvenile was also charged with a misdemeanor for providing false information to investigators. The suspect was also charged with misdemeanor counts of providing false information to conservation officers, possession of marijuana, and underage consumption of alcohol. The second juvenile was not involved in the setting of the fire.\n\nFollowing the fire, experts recommended that the Webster Sycamore be felled or fenced off as a security measure. According to the Division of Forestry, the tree was finally brought down during the summer of 2010.\n\nIn recognition of the tree, the Health Policy Division of the Office of the West Virginia Insurance Commissioner considered the name \"Sycamore Healthcare Exchange\" as one of the naming options for West Virginia's health insurance marketplace in 2011, following the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n"}
