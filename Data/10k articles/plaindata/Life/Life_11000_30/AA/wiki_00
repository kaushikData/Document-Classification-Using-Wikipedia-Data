The network uses memistors. It was developed by Professor Bernard Widrow and his graduate student Ted Hoff at Stanford University in 1960. It is based on the McCulloch–Pitts neuron. It consists of a weight, a bias and a summation function.\n\nThe difference between Adaline and the standard (McCulloch–Pitts) perceptron is that in the learning phase, the weights are adjusted according to the weighted sum of the inputs (the net). In the standard perceptron, the net is passed to the activation (transfer) function and the function's output is used for adjusting the weights.\n\nA multilayer network of ADALINE units is known as a MADALINE.\n\nAdaline is a single layer neural network with multiple nodes where each node accepts multiple inputs and generates one output. Given the following variables:as\n\nthen we find that the output is formula_6. If we further assume that\n\nthen the output further reduces to: formula_9\n\nLet us assume:\n\nthen the weights are updated as follows formula_13. The ADALINE converges to the least squares error which is formula_14.\nThis update rule is in fact the stochastic gradient descent update for linear regression.\n\nMADALINE (Many ADALINE) is a three-layer (input, hidden, output), fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network architecture for classification that uses ADALINE units in its hidden and output layers, i.e. its activation function is the sign function. The three-layer network uses memistors. Three different training algorithms for MADALINE networks, which cannot be learned using backpropagation because the sign function is not differentiable, have been suggested, called Rule I, Rule II and Rule III. The first of these dates back to 1962 and cannot adapt the weights of the hidden-output connection. The second training algorithm improved on Rule I and was described in 1988. The third \"Rule\" applied to a modified network with sigmoid activations instead of signum; it was later found to be equivalent to backpropagation.\n\nThe Rule II training algorithm is based on a principle called \"minimal disturbance\". It proceeds by looping over training examples, then for each example, it:\n\nAdditionally, when flipping single units' signs does not drive the error to zero for a particular example, the training algorithm starts flipping pairs of units' signs, then triples of units, etc.\n\n\n"}

Socrates of Constantinople calls him \"bishop of Persia\".\n\nAbdas was born in fourth-century Chaldor to a Zoroastrian mother, who educated him in matters of virtue. After Abdas reached adulthood, he was ordained a Christian priest, and built up in his hometown a monastery and a school, which grew to have around 60 teachers. Abdas baptized many converts in Chaldor, which caused the magi to arrest him. In prison, Abdas was subjected to humiliations, hunger and pain, but remained a Christian until his release. Abdas became a bishop in Kaskhar (Susa).\n\nAbdas was an associate of Maruthas of Martyropolis. Abdas is supposed to have helped Maruthas in driving out a demon from King Yezdegerd's son. However, his impetuosity, put an end to the good relations between the Persian king and the Christian community. Engaged in a dispute with the local magi in AD 420, Abdas destroyed one of the fire temples of the Zoroastrians. Complaint was made to King Yazdegerd, who ordered the bishop to restore the building and make good all damage that he had committed. Abdas refused to rebuild a heathen temple at his own expense. These events soured the relationship between the Christian church and the Persian government, which had previously been good, and caused a wave of persecution against the Christians in Persia. The result was that orders were issued for the destruction of all churches, and these were carried out by the Zoroastrians, who had regarded with great envy the royal favour extended to Maruthas and his co-religionists. Before long the destruction of churches developed into a general persecution, in which Abdas was one of the first martyrs.\n\nHis companions included the priests Hashu and Isaac, the secretary Ephrem, the hypodeacon Papa, the laymen Daduk and Durdan, and Papa, a brother of Abdas himself were also killed. His feast day is 5 September or 16 May in the Roman Catholic Church, and March 31 in the Syrian church.\n\n"}

{"id": "73962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73962", "title": "Abgar V", "text": "Abgar V\n\nAbgar V (died c. AD 40), called Ukamma (the Black), was the King of Osroene with his capital at Edessa.\n\nAbgar was described as \"king of the Arabs\" by Tacitus, a near-contemporary source. According to Movses Khorenatsi, Abgar was an Armenian. Yet both Robert W.Thomson and Richard G. Hovannisian state Abgar's Armenian ethnicity was invented by Khorenatsi. Most modern academics present the Abgarid dynasty as an Arab dynasty. Consequently, Lucas Van Rompay, Professor Emeritus of Religious Studies, states that, \"as far as the ethnic descent of the Abgarid kings is concerned, we cannot ascertain whether they were Arabs(as some of the names may indicate), Aramean, Parthian, or Armenian\". Abgar's nephew, King Sanatruk of Armenia, is also chronicled extensively in Armenian writings.\n\nAbgar V came to power in 4 BC. He became a Roman client, lost his throne in 7 AD and regained it five years later.\n\nArmenian historian Movses Khorenatsi, or Moses of Chorene (ca. 410–490s AD), reported that the chief wife of King Abgar V was Queen Helena of Adiabene, the wife of King Monobaz I of Adiabene, and thus the kingdoms of Edessa and Adiabene were linked in some manner. Robert Eisenman suggests Queen Helena as one of the wives of King Abgar V, who allotted her the lands of Adiabene. Professor Eisenman derived this association from Movses Khorenatsi mentioning the same famine relief to Judaea as does Flavius Josephus:\nProfessor Eisenman goes on to equate King Abgarus V with the Agabus in Acts of the Apostles (Acts 11:27-30), because Agabus was identified with the same famine relief as Queen Helena. By necessity Eisenman then equates the biblical Antioch Orontes with Antioch Edessa, indicating that Paul the Apostle and Barnabas went to Edessa.\n\nOn August 24, 2009, the board of the Central Bank of Armenia adopted a decision on introducing a new banknote with a nominal value of AMD 100,000. The new banknote depicts King Abgar V, described as King of Armenian Mesopotamia. The front of the banknote depicts Abgar pointing at the royal flag bearing an image of the Mandylion. The reverse of the banknote depicts disciple Thaddeus of Edessa handing the canvas to King Abgar V and his consequent miraculous healing.\n\nAbgar V is claimed to be one of the first Christian kings in history, having been converted to the faith by Thaddeus of Edessa, one of the seventy disciples.\n\nThe church historian Eusebius records that the Edessan archives contained a copy of a correspondence exchanged between Abgar of Edessa and Jesus. The correspondence consisted of Abgar's letter and the answer dictated by Jesus. On August 15, 944, the Church of St. Mary of Blachernae in Constantinople received the letter and the Mandylion. Both relics were then moved to the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos.\n\nThe account of this enjoyed great popularity in the East, and also in the West, during the Middle Ages: Jesus' letter was copied on parchment, inscribed in marble and metal, and used as a talisman or an amulet. Of this correspondence, there survive not only a Syriac text, but an Armenian translation as well, two independent Greek versions, shorter than the Syriac, and several inscriptions on stone.\n\nA curious growth has arisen from this event, with scholars disputing whether Abgar suffered from gout or from leprosy, whether the correspondence was on parchment or papyrus, and so forth.\n\nThe text of the letter was:\nJesus gave the messenger the reply to return to Abgar:\nEgeria wrote of the letter in her account of her pilgrimage in Edessa. She read the letter during her stay, and remarked that the copy in Edessa was fuller than the copies in her home (which was likely France).\n\nIn addition to the importance it attained in the apocryphal cycle, the correspondence of King Abgar also gained a place in liturgy for some time. The Syriac liturgies commemorate the correspondence of Abgar during Lent. The Celtic liturgy appears to have attached importance to it; the \"Liber Hymnorum\", a manuscript preserved at Trinity College, Dublin (E. 4, 2), gives two collects on the lines of the letter to Abgar. It is even possible that this letter, followed by various prayers, may have formed a minor liturgical office in some Catholic churches.\n\nThis event has played an important part in the self-definition of several Eastern churches. Abgar is counted as saint, with feasts on May 11 and October 28 in the Eastern Orthodox Church, August 1 in the Syrian Church, and daily in the Mass of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The Armenian Apostolic Church in Scottsdale, Arizona, is named after Saint Abgar (also spelled as Apkar).\n\nThe scholar Bart D. Ehrman cites evidence from Han Drijvers and others for regarding the whole correspondence as forged in the third century by orthodox Christians \"as an anti-Manichaean polemic\", and entirely spurious.\n\nA number of contemporary scholars have suggested origins of the tradition of Abgar's conversion apart from historical record. S. K. Ross suggests the story of Abgar is in the genre of a genealogical myth which traces the origin of a community back to a mythical or divine ancestor. F. C. Burkitt argues that the conversion of Edessa at the time of Abgar VIII was retrojected upon the Apostolic age. William Adler suggests the origin of the story of the conversion of Abgar V was an invention of an antiquarian researcher employed by Abgar VIII, who had recently converted to Christianity, in an effort to securely root Christianity in the history of the city. Walter Bauer, on the other hand, argued the legend was written without sources to reinforce group cohesiveness, orthodoxy, and apostolic succession against heretical schismatics.\n\nSignificant advances in scholarship on the topic have been made by Desreumaux's translation with commentary, M. Illert's collection of textual witnesses to the legend, and detailed studies of the ideology of the sources by Brock, Griffith, and Mirkovic. The majority of scholars now claim the goal of the authors and editors of texts regarding the conversion of Abgar were not so much concerned with historical reconstruction of the Christianisation of Edessa as the relationships between church and state power, based on the political and ecclesiological ideas of Ephraem the Syrian. However, the origins of the story are far still from certain, although the stories as recorded seem to have been shaped by the controversies of the third century CE, especially as a response to Bardaisan.\n\n\n"}

It often involves breaking down and examining the distinctive patterns and characteristics of the programming code and then comparing them to computer code whose authorship is known. Unlike software forensics, code stylometry attributes authorship for purposes other than intellectual property infringement, including plagiarism detection, copyright investigation, and authorship verification.\n\nIn 1989, researchers Paul Oman and Curtis Cook identified the authorship of 18 different Pascal programs written by six authors by using “markers” based on typographic characteristics.\n\nIn 1998, researchers Stephen MacDonell, Andrew Gray, and Philip Sallis developed a dictionary-based author attribution system called IDENTIFIED (Integrated Dictionary-based Extraction of Non-language-dependent Token Information for Forensic Identification, Examination, and Discrimination) that determined the authorship of source code in computer programs written in C++. The researchers noted that authorship can be identified using degrees if flexibility in the writing style of the source code, such as:\n\n\nThe IDENTIFIED system attributed authorship by first merging all the relevant files to produce a single source code file and then subjecting it to a metrics analysis by counting the number of occurrences for each metric. In addition, the system was language-independent due to its ability to create new dictionary files and meta-dictionaries.\n\nIn 1999, a team of researchers led by Stephen MacDonell tested the performance of three different program authorship discrimination techniques on 351 programs written in C++ by 7 different authors. The researchers compared the effectiveness of using a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) that was trained on a back-propagation algorithm, multiple discriminant analysis (MDA), and case-based reasoning (CBR). At the end of the experiment, both the neural network and the MDA had an accuracy rate of 81.1%, while the CBR reached an accuracy performance of 88.0%.\n\nIn 2005, researchers from the Laboratory of Information and Communication Systems Security at Aegean University introduced a language-independent method of program authorship attribution where they used byte-level n-grams to classify a program to an author. This technique scanned the files and then created a table of different n-grams found in the source code and the number of times they appear. In addition, the system could operate with limited numbers of training examples from each author. However, the more source code programs that were present for each author, the more reliable the author attribution. In an experiment testing their approach, the researchers found that classification using n-grams reached an accuracy rate of up to 100%, although the rate declined drastically if the profile size exceeded 500 and the n-gram size was 3 or less.\n\nIn 2011, researchers from the University of Wisconsin created a program authorship attribution system that identified a programmer based on the binary code of a program instead of the source code. The researchers utilized machine learning and training code to determine which characteristics of the code would be helpful in describing the programming style. In an experiment testing the approach on a set of programs written by 10 different authors, the system achieved an accuracy rate of 81%. When tested using a set of programs written by almost 200 different authors, the system performed with an accuracy rate of 51%.\n\nIn 2015, a team of postdoctoral researchers from Princeton University, Drexel University, the University of Maryland, and the University of Goettingen as well as researchers from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory developed a program authorship attribution system that could determine the author of a program from a sample pool with programs written by 1,600 coders with a 94 percent accuracy. The methodology consisted of four steps:\n\n\nThis approach analyzed various characteristics of the code, such as blank space, the use of tabs and spaces, and the names of variables, and then used a method of evaluation called a syntax tree analysis that translated the sample code into tree-like diagrams that displayed the structural decisions involved in writing the code. The design of these diagrams prioritized the order of the commands and the depths of the functions that were nestled in the code.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials were able to determine that the 2014 cyber attack on Sony Pictures was sponsored by North Korea after evaluating the software, techniques, and network sources. The attribution was made after cybersecurity experts noticed similarities between the code used in the attack and a malicious software known as Shamoon, which was used in the 2013 attacks against South Korean banks and broadcasting companies by North Korea.\n"}

It involves an illegal agreement between two or more parties in which one party agrees to kill the target in exchange for some form of payment, monetary or otherwise. Either party may be a person, group, or an organization. In the United States, the crime is punishable by 15 years to life in a state penitentiary. Contract killing has been associated with organized crime, government conspiracies, and vendettas. For example, in the United States, the gang Murder, Inc. committed hundreds of murders on behalf of the National Crime Syndicate during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nContract killing provides the hiring party with the advantage of not having to commit the actual killing, making it more difficult for law enforcement to connect said party with the murder. The likelihood that authorities will establish that party's guilt for the committed crime, especially due to lack of forensic evidence linked to the contracting party, makes the case more difficult to attribute to the hiring party.\n\nA study by the Australian Institute of Criminology of 162 attempted or actual contract murders in Australia between 1989 and 2002 indicated that the most common reason for murder-for-hire was insurance policies payouts. The study also found that the average payment for a \"hit\" was $15,000 with variation from $5,000 up to $30,000 and that the most commonly used weapons were firearms. Contract killings accounted for 2% of murders in Australia during that time period.\nContract killings also make up a relatively similar percentage of all killings elsewhere. For example, they made up about 5% of all murders in Scotland from 1993 to 2002.\n\n\n\n\nFictional cases of contract killing or \"hitmen\" are depicted in a range of popular fiction genres in the 20th and 21st century, including films, comic books and video games. A notiable example being the video game series \"Hitman\", where the player controls a hired gun simply known as Agent 47.\n\n\n\n"}

Her father was a carpenter and semi-professional musician, playing clarinet and saxophone with a group called Os Oito Batutas (the Eight Batons). He died when Dalva was just eight years old, and, as a result, Dalva and her three sisters were placed into an orphanage, where Dalva remained for three years. At the orphanage, Dalva learned to play piano and organ, as well as choral singing. Dalva left the orphanage due to an illness, and went to live with her mother in the city of São Paulo.\n\nIn 1933, while still a teenager, Dalva began working as a singer, touring (together with her mother) with a group led by Antônio Zovetti.

His brother, the then-President and current First Secretary Raúl Castro, made an announcement about his death on state television. Most foreign government officials, most notably in Latin America, Africa, and South Asia, praised Castro for improving healthcare and education for Cuba's rural poor, opposing international racism, and standing up to US hegemony in the Western Hemisphere while others, especially in the US, Europe, and Canada were more critical of his legacy, bashing him as an evil tyrant who drove the Cuban economy to the ground and quashed all opposition to his rule. Some officials gave more neutral condolences while others issued statements about positive binational relations with Cuba (South Africa, Namibia, and Angola praised Castro for ending apartheid in South Africa and freeing Namibia in order to reinforce Mandela's common cause with Castro in fighting racism). Castro's body was cremated and his ashes were interred in Santiago de Cuba on 4 December 2016, and hundreds of thousands of Cubans commemorated the event.\n\nIn April 2016, Castro told the Communist Party: \"I'll be 90 years old soon. Soon, I'll be like all the others. The time will come for all of us, but the ideas of the Cuban communists will remain as proof on this planet that if they are worked at with fervour and dignity, they can produce the material and cultural goods that human beings need, and we need to fight without truce to obtain them.\" In February 2016, his older brother Ramón died at the age of 91.\n\nCastro's death was expected in South Florida, with media and governments expecting and hoping that it would cause chaotic celebrations and regime change plans. The city of Miami had planned to open the Orange Bowl Stadium for celebrations; schools might have dismissed early; and police and government officials might have blocked boat piers to prevent Cuban exiles from trying to invade the island. The \"Miami Herald\" created a \"Cuba plan\" more than 20 years before Castro's death; as much as 60 pages in length, it included multiple newspaper extras and reporters joining the United States Coast Guard as it handled the expected large number of refugees fleeing the island. Its journalists prepared to surreptitiously enter Cuba; employees knew that Castro's death would interrupt any vacation or weekend. After Raúl Castro became the country's leader and visiting Cuba became easier, such plans became less important.\n\nFollowing Castro's death, his brother Raúl Castro announced: \"According to the will expressed by comrade Fidel, his body will be cremated in the early hours\" of 26 November 2016. The cremation was a private affair, with only state and party officials attending together with Fidel's family and friends.\n\nThe casket carrying his ashes then lay in state for Cubans to pay homage to Castro at the José Martí Memorial in Havana on 28 and 29 November. A memorial rally then took place at the Plaza de la Revolución at 19:00 on 29 November in which President Raúl Castro as well as various world leaders who were allies of Castro paid tribute, including the presidents of Panama, Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela and South Africa, along with the prime minister of Greece and leaders of a host of smaller countries in Africa. From 29 November to 3 December the casket carrying his ashes travelled along a 900 kilometres route to Santiago de Cuba, tracing in reverse the route of the \"Freedom Caravan\" of January 1959 in which Castro and his rebels took power. At one point, the jeep broke down and had to be pushed by attending soldiers.\n\nOn 3 December at 19:00, another mass gathering took place at Plaza Antonio Maceo in Santiago de Cuba and Raul and other foreign leaders and dignitaries People waved the flag of Cuba and sang the national anthem. Raul Castro said in a final speech that Castro showed it was \"possible to firmly maintain the inalienable principles of our sovereignty without fear to the nuclear blackmail of the United States during those days of the missile crisis in October 1962.\" He further added that in Castro's images and statues will not be displayed in public places and roads will not be named after him. \"The leader of the revolution strongly opposed any manifestation of cult of personality.\" again paid tribute to Fidel. The next day, 4 December at 7:00, the interment of Castro's ashes occurred in a private ceremony in Santa Ifigenia Cemetery in Santiago de Cuba, where Cuban national hero José Martí is also buried. As a camouflage-green hearse went to the cemetery, mourners lined the streets and cheered Viva Fidel!\" and “Yo Soy, Fidel!\" A secretly constructed tomb was also at the venue. Final events occurred as a 21-gun salute was fired and the ashes, in a coffin wrapped in Cuban flag, disappeared from public view as television cameras and journalists were not allowed inside, save for cameramen from the Sistema Informativo de la Television, which provided the live coverage for television channels islandwide.\n\nMost states sent delegations led by high or mid-ranking officials to the funeral; many African and Latin American states sent delegations led by presidents or prime ministers.\n\nU.K. Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn was scheduled to attend as part of his country's delegation. However, his attendance was later denied. U.S. preacher and civil rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson spoke at a memorial for Castro in Havana. Others in attendance included Hollywood's Danny Glover and Argentine football player Diego Maradona, who said: \"I feel Cuban.\"\n\nMemorials in Castro's names were conducted in places outside Cuba:\n\nAlgeria declared eight days of mourning; Bolivia decreed seven days of national mourning; Equatorial Guinea decreed three days of national mourning; Nicaragua decreed nine days of national mourning; North Korea declared a period of mourning for three days; and Venezuela decreed three days of national mourning., Namibia declared a period of mourning for three days Uruguay, Vietnam, Angola decreed one day of national mourning; Trinidad and Tobago decreed that the national flag be flown at half-mast for one day; while Haiti decreed three days of mourning; and Dominica declared national mourning for Castro.\n\nIn Venezuela, a ceremony was held at Mountain Barrack, where President Nicolas Maduro told a crowd on 27 November: \"Men and women of this great Latin American and Caribbean homeland! Fidel and (Hugo) Chavez, who are already together there in the heaven of the just, are more future than anything else in the battles we are going to fight today. And I am sure they have only one destiny: the definitive victory of their ideas. Long live the eternal memory of Fidel Castro. Long live the example of the martyrs. Long live the legacy of Hugo Chavez.\" In Bolivia, President Evo Morales spoke at Ivirgarzama in Cochabamba saying that Castro's fight had not been for Cuban and Latin American people alone, but \"for the people of the world who fight for their liberation.\" He further gave tribute to \"a human being\" who \"gave his life for the people of the world.\" In Quito, Ecuador, the statue of Castro was a focal point as people also congregated outside the National Theater in tribute. Mourners also signed a book of condolences at the Cuban embassy, while a concert was organised outside the House of Culture, where Castro had once visited.\n\nAbout 500 people also gathered at the Cuban embassy in Mexico City. Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang, who was the last head of state to meet Castro in Cuba, and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc paid their respects at the Cuban embassy in Hanoi on 28 November in commemoration of Castro. Hundreds of other Vietnamese people attended the ceremony and brought flowers to the embassy too. In Cape Town, mourners reflected of Castro's anti-apartheid solidarity with Nelson Mandela.\n\nPresident Raúl Castro somberly announced on national television: \"The commander in chief of the Cuban revolution died at 22:29 (CST) this evening.\" He recalled at the end of his speech: \"¡Hasta la victoria siempre!\" (\"Towards victory, always!\")\n\nThe Council of State of the Republic of Cuba declared nine days of national mourning from 06:00 on 26 November until 12:00 on 4 December. A statement read: \"During the mourning period, all public events and activities will cease, the national flag will fly at half-mast on public buildings and at military facilities and television and radio will broadcast informative, patriotic and historical programmes.\" This included the postponement of the grand military parade to mark the 60th anniversary of the landing of the yacht \"Granma\" and Armed Forces Day in Havana's Plaza de la Revolucion by a month from 2 December to 2 January 2017. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla suspended a visit to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe Cuban Embassy in the United States made an announcement in writing: \"Until forever, Commander! This No. 25, at 10:29 p.m. the Commander in Chief of the Cuban Revolution Fidel Castro Ruz passed away.\" It also posted an image that read: \"Hasta Siempre, Comandante.\"\n\nOn 29 November, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Havana to pay tribute to Castro. They chanted slogans such as: \"Long live the revolution!\" and \"Fidel! Fidel!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the early hours of 26 November, the Cuban-American diaspora in Little Havana, Miami, as well as in Hialeah, Florida, also had celebrations amongst the thousands of exiles. In San Francisco, California, the diasporic reaction was more mixed. Cuban-American celebrities commented on Castro's death, including: Jose Canseco, who wrote he \"[c]an't say I feel anything for his death. There is a reason many defected to USA;\" and Gloria Estefan, who stated that the event marks \"the symbolic death of the destructive ideologies that he espoused that, I believe, is filling the Cuban exile community with renewed hope and a relief that has been long in coming.\" Castro's death became public too late for eastern U.S. newspapers' print editions, but CNN covered Raúl Castro's announcement as breaking news. The \"Herald\" posted online its long-ready obituary, written in 2001.\n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Adolfo Pérez Esquivel said: \"From the roots of Our America Fidel left for eternity. Liberator, apostle, humanist, friend…\" His fellow Nobel laureate Rigoberta Menchú said: \"Our revolution is humanist because it humanises man.\" Former Argentine footballer Diego Maradona stated that Castro was a \"great\" man and that, while he was away for the 2016 Davis Cup in Croatia: \"[t]hey called me from Buenos Aires and it was a shock. I'm terribly sad as he was like a second father.\"\n\nMinoru Hataguchi, who led Castro through the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum as its director, said Castro sympathised with the ordeal of \"hibakusha\". He quoted Castro as having said: \"Che Guevara told me to go to Hiroshima. I’m glad I came.\" He added that Castro \"sympathised with the people of Hiroshima and his death is unfortunate.\" He further noted that Castro's questions \"showed his character, that he was trying to understand the agonies of the \"hibakusha\".\" Masakazu Masukawa, another \"hibakusha\" who had met Castro during a visit to Cuba in 2012 recalled that Castro \"was a person of influence. If he had called on the world to abandon nuclear weapons early on, momentum might have grown bigger.\"\n\nChairman of the Human Rights Foundation Garry Kasparov wrote: \"Fidel Castro was one of the 20th century's many monsters. We should lament only that he had so long to inflict misery on Cuba and beyond.\" Amnesty International's Americas Director Erika Guevara-Rosas issued a statement that described Castro as a \"progressive but deeply flawed leader.\" It cited: \"Access to public services such as health and education for Cubans were substantially improved by the Cuban revolution and for this, his leadership must be applauded. However, despite these achievements in areas of social policy, Fidel Castro’s 49-year reign was characterised by a ruthless suppression of freedom of expression... Fidel Castro’s legacy is a tale of two worlds. The question now is what human rights will look like in a future Cuba. The lives of many depend on it.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "53949150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53949150", "title": "Death of Don Kemp", "text": "Death of Don Kemp\n\nP. Donald \"Don\" Kemp (1947 – ca. November 16, 1982) was an advertising executive from New York who disappeared in mysterious circumstances in a remote part of Wyoming in 1982. He remained missing until his remains were discovered in 1986, a short distance from where his car was found abandoned four years previously.\n\nKemp was working in advertising on Madison Avenue in New York City when a traffic accident left him with debilitating injuries that took him several years to recover from. He decided to leave the rat race and embark on a fresh start in a mountain cabin in the Jackson Hole valley in Wyoming.\n\nKemp left New York in September 1982 and drove to Wyoming in his Chevrolet Blazer. On November 15, 1982, the day before he disappeared, he visited a museum in Cheyenne, where he stayed for around two hours and did not speak to anyone. Upon leaving the museum, he left behind his briefcase, which contained his diaries, address book, traveler's checks and glasses needed for driving.\n\nOn the morning of November 16, 1982, Kemp's car was found abandoned with its engine still running, on a ramp off the I-80, 40 miles from the nearest town. The car was so full of belongings that there would have been no space for anyone except the driver. A single pair of footprints in the snow led investigators six miles into the wilderness to a barn, where they found a pile of sticks arranged to start a fire, and three of Kemp's socks. There were no footprints leading away from the barn, but Kemp was nowhere to be found. Nearby, investigators found a duffel bag containing laundry soap, clothes and a teapot, all of which belonged to Kemp.\n\nDue to the solitary set of footprints, the lack of space for anyone else in the car, and the featureless terrain which should have enabled searchers to easily spot a human being, investigators believed from the outset that Kemp had either disappeared of his own volition and did not want to be found, or was mentally unstable. Deputy Rod Johnson stated: “I felt the guy was disorientated, and I felt that he didn’t want to be found. If he would’ve wanted to be found, he would have heard the aircraft, could have waved his arms, got our attention, gone up to a ridge, anywhere, and been sighted.”\n\nThree days after Kemp's disappearance, there was a blizzard and the search was called off. Everyone involved in the search agreed that if Kemp was in the area and not already dead, he would have died in the blizzard.\n\nSeveral months after Kemp disappeared, Judy Aiello, a close friend of his from New York, returned home from an extended vacation to find six messages on her answering machine featuring a voice that she was certain was Kemp's, although the caller never stated their name. The caller sounded panicked and read out a number, urging Aiello to call him back. She did so the next day: a man answered and Aiello asked if Don was there. The man replied \"Yes,\" then almost immediately said, \"No\". Aiello asked the man if he could ask Don to call her back; the man replied \"Yeah\" and hung up. Aiello never received a call back.\n\nAiello informed Kemp's mother, Mary, who in turn informed the authorities. They traced the calls to a rented trailer in Casper, Wyoming, occupied by a man named Mark Dennis. Dennis denied making the calls and of ever having met Don Kemp. He suggested that either someone else used his telephone without his knowledge, or that the telephone company made a mistake about the number used to call Aiello. He agreed to a polygraph test and the authorities described him as cooperative and were satisfied that he was not involved in Kemp's disappearance.\n\nMary Kemp disagreed with the police's opinion on Dennis and traveled to Wyoming to question him herself. Dennis refused to speak to Mary Kemp and hired an attorney, before abruptly moving away from Casper three weeks after he was initially questioned by the police.\n\nKemp's decomposed remains were discovered in 1985 by hunters a few miles from where his car was found. The autopsy showed no signs of foul play, and the authorities are satisfied that he walked into the wilderness voluntarily and died in or before the blizzard in the immediate aftermath. However, it remains a mystery as to how Kemp's body was not found during the initial search, as his body was located in a clearly visible place that had already been searched.\n\nMary Kemp never accepted the findings and claimed up until her death in 2014 that her son was murdered by Mark Dennis.\n\nThe telephone calls remain a mystery, as Judy Aiello's number was unlisted. Theories on online forums have surmised that someone found Kemp's address book that he had left at the museum in Cheyenne, and phoned Aiello as a prank, while others have suggested that Kemp may have been abducted upon leaving the museum, explaining why Aiello was convinced that it was Kemp's voice on the voicemail messages.\n\nIn addition, two separate sightings of Kemp were reported in Casper in the months following the believed time of his death. One sighting was at an Abraham Lincoln exhibition and the other was at a bar.\n\nOnline enthusiasts have theorised that Kemp may have been targeted in relation to his research on Abraham Lincoln, believing that he discovered something about Lincoln that would have caused shockwaves and was consequently silenced. In the years following Kemp's death, some of his research notes were stolen, and several of the people who came into possession of these notes died in suspicious circumstances.\n\nKemp's case was covered in the first-ever episode of long-running investigative show \"Unsolved Mysteries\" in January 1987.\n\nThe case was covered in a June 2016 episode of true-crime podcast \"The Trail Went Cold\".\n\n"}

Both of his parents were computer programmers in China. At age 11, he moved to Iowa with his mother (his father was not able to join them for several years). He attended Theodore Roosevelt High School and Central Academy in Des Moines, graduating in 2000. In 1999 he attended the acclaimed Research Science Institute at MIT, and in 2000 he won 3rd Place in the Intel Science Talent Search. He earned his A.B. in Chemistry and Physics from Harvard University in 2004 where he worked with Xiaowei Zhuang. He then received his Ph.D. in chemical and biological engineering from Stanford University in 2009 under the guidance of Karl Deisseroth where he developed the technologies behind optogenetics with Edward Boyden. He served as an independent Junior Fellow in the Harvard Society of Fellows.\n\nZhang's lab is focused on using synthetic biology to develop technologies for genome and epigenome engineering to study neurobiology. He is a leader in the field of optogenetics, which was named the 2010 \"Method of the Year\". As a postdoc, he began work on using TAL effectors to control gene transcription.\n\nBased on previous work by the Sylvain Moineau Lab, Dr. Zhang began work to harness and optimize the CRISPR system to work in human cells in early 2011. While Zhang's group was optimizing the Cas9 system in human cells, the collaborating groups of Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna described a chimeric RNA design which is capable of facilitating cleavage of free-floating DNA using purified Cas9 protein and a synthetic guide. Zhang's group compared their RNA expression approach with a design based on the Doudna / Charpentier chimeric RNA for use in human cells and established features of the guide necessary for Cas9 to function effectively in mammalian cells which are dispensable in biochemical assays.\n\nHis lab has developed a sensitive diagnostic nucleic acid detection protocol that is based on CRISPR termed SHERLOCK (Specific High sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) that is able to detect and distinguish strains of viruses and bacteria present in as low as attomolar (10 M) concentration.\n\nZhang is a recipient of the NIH Director's Pioneer Award and a 2012 Searle Scholar.

{"id": "169552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169552", "title": "Fifth force", "text": "Fifth force\n\nIn physics, there are four conventionally accepted fundamental forces or interactions that form the basis of all known interactions in nature: gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces.\nSome speculative theories have proposed a fifth force to explain various anomalous observations that do not fit existing theories. The characteristics of this fifth force depend on the theory being advanced. Many postulate a force roughly the strength of gravity (i.e. it is much weaker than electromagnetism or the nuclear forces) with a range of anywhere from less than a millimeter to cosmological scales. Another proposal is a new weak force, mediated by W' and Z' bosons.\n\nThe search for a fifth force has increased in recent decades due to two discoveries in cosmology which are not explained by current theories. It has been discovered that most of the mass of the universe is accounted for by an unknown form of matter called dark matter. Most physicists believe that dark matter is some new undiscovered subatomic particle, but some believe that it could be related to an unknown fundamental force. Second, it has also recently been discovered that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, which has been attributed to a form of energy called dark energy. Some physicists speculate that a form of dark energy called quintessence could be a fifth force.\n\nA new fundamental force might be difficult to test. Gravity, for example, is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass. Therefore, it takes very sensitive equipment to measure gravitational interactions between objects that are small compared to the Earth. A new (or \"fifth\") fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect. Nonetheless, in the late 1980s a fifth force, operating on municipal scales (i.e. with a range of about 100 meters), was reported by researchers (Fischbach \"et al.\") who were reanalyzing results of Loránd Eötvös from earlier in the century. The force was believed to be linked with hypercharge. Over a number of years, other experiments have failed to duplicate this result.\n\nThere are at least three kinds of searches that can be undertaken, which depend on the kind of force being considered, and its range.\n\nOne way to search for a fifth force is with tests of the strong equivalence principle: this is one of the most powerful tests of Einstein's theory of gravity: general relativity. Alternative theories of gravity, such as Brans–Dicke theory, have a fifth force—possibly with infinite range. This is because gravitational interactions, in theories other than general relativity, have degrees of freedom other than the \"metric\", which dictates the curvature of space, and different kinds of degrees of freedom produce different effects. For example, a scalar field cannot produce the bending of light rays. The fifth force would manifest itself in an effect on solar system orbits, called the Nordtvedt effect. This is tested with Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and very long baseline interferometry.\n\nAnother kind of fifth force, which arises in Kaluza–Klein theory, where the universe has extra dimensions, or in supergravity or string theory is the Yukawa force, which is transmitted by a light scalar field (i.e. a scalar field with a long Compton wavelength, which determines the range). This has prompted a lot of recent interest, as a theory of supersymmetric large extra dimensions—dimensions with size slightly less than a millimeter—has prompted an experimental effort to test gravity on these very small scales. This requires extremely sensitive experiments which search for a deviation from the inverse square law of gravity over a range of distances. Essentially, they are looking for signs that the Yukawa interaction is kicking in at a certain length.\n\nAustralian researchers, attempting to measure the gravitational constant deep in a mine shaft, found a discrepancy between the predicted and measured value, with the measured value being two percent too small. They concluded that the results may be explained by a repulsive fifth force with a range from a few centimetres to a kilometre. Similar experiments have been carried out on board a submarine, USS \"Dolphin\" (AGSS-555), while deeply submerged. A further experiment measuring the gravitational constant in a deep borehole in the Greenland ice sheet found discrepancies of a few percent, but it was not possible to eliminate a geological source for the observed signal.\n\nAnother experiment uses the earth's mantle as a giant particle detector, focusing on geoelectrons.\n\nIn 2012 Bhuvnesh Jain and others examined existing data on the rate of pulsation of cepheid variable stars in 25 galaxies comprising over a thousand stars in all. Theory suggests that the rate of pulsation would follow a different pattern in galaxies screened from a hypothetical fifth force by neighbourhood clusters from those that are not screened. They were unable to find any variation from Einstein’s theory of gravity.\n\nSome experiments used a lake plus a tower that is high. A comprehensive review by Ephraim Fischbach and Carrick Talmadge suggested there is no compelling evidence for the fifth force, though scientists still search for it. The Fishbach-Talmadge article was written in 1992, and since then, other evidence has come to light that may indicate a fifth force.\n\nThe above experiments search for a fifth force that is, like gravity, independent of the composition of an object, so all objects experience the force in proportion to their masses. Forces that depend on the composition of an object can be very sensitively tested by torsion balance experiments of a type invented by Loránd Eötvös. Such forces may depend, for example, on the ratio of protons to neutrons in an atomic nucleus, nuclear spin, or the relative amount of different kinds of binding energy in a nucleus (see the semi-empirical mass formula). Searches have been done from very short ranges, to municipal scales, to the scale of the Earth, the sun, and dark matter at the center of the galaxy.\n\nAlso known as non-local gravity. A few physicists think that Einstein's theory of gravity will have to be modified, not at small scales, but at large distances, or, equivalently, small accelerations. This would change the gravity force to a non-local force. They point out that dark matter and dark energy are unexplained by the Standard Model of particle physics and suggest that some modification of gravity, possibly arising from Modified Newtonian Dynamics or the holographic principle, is necessary. This is fundamentally different from conventional ideas of a fifth force, as it grows stronger relative to gravity at longer distances. Most physicists, however, think that dark matter and dark energy are not \"ad hoc\", but are supported by a large number of complementary observations and described by a very simple model.\n\nIn 2015, Attila Krasznahorkay at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences's Institute for Nuclear Research in Debrecen, Hungary, and his colleagues posited the existence of a new, light boson only 34 times heavier than the electron. In an effort to find a dark photon, the Hungarian team fired protons at thin targets of lithium-7, which created unstable beryllium-8 nuclei that then decayed and spat out pairs of electrons and positrons. Excess decays were observed at an opening angle of 140° between the \"e\" and \"e\" and a combined energy of 17 MeV, which indicated that a small fraction of beryllium-8 will shed excess energy in the form of a new particle.\n\nIn 2016, Jonathan Feng et al., proposed that a protophobic X-boson with a mass of 16.7 MeV with suppressed couplings to protons relative to neutrons and electrons and femtometer range could explain the data. The force may explain m-2 muon anomaly and provide a dark matter candidate. Several research experiments are underway to attempt to validate or refute these results.\n"}
{"id": "53307338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53307338", "title": "FlowFET", "text": "FlowFET\n\nA flowFET is a microfluidic component which allows the rate of flow of liquid in a microfluidic channel to be modulated by the electrical potential applied to it. In this way, it behaves as a microfluidic analogue to the field effect transistor, except that in the flowFET the flow of liquid takes the place of the flow of electric current. Indeed, the name of the flowFET is derived from the naming convention of electronic FETs (e.g. MOSFET, FINFET etc.).\n\nA flowFET relies on the principal of electro-osmotic flow (EOF). In many liquid-solid interfaces, there is an electrical double layer that develops due to interactions between the two phases. In the case of a microfluidic channel, this results in a charged layer of liquid on the periphery of the fluid column which surrounds the bulk of the liquid. This electric double layer has an associated potential difference known as the zeta potential. When an appropriately-oriented electrical field is applied to this interfacial double layer (i.e. parallel to the channel and in the plane of the electric double layer), the charged liquid ions experience a motive Lorentz force. Since this layer sheaths the fluid column, and since this layer moves, the entire column of liquid will begin to move with a speed formula_1. The velocity of the fluid layer \"diffuses\" into the bulk of the channel from the periphery towards the centre due to viscous coupling. The speed is related to the strength of the electric field formula_2, the magnitude of the zeta potential formula_3, the permittivity formula_4 and the viscosity formula_5 of the fluid:\n\nformula_6\n\nIn a FlowFET, the zeta potential between the channel walls and the fluid can be altered by applying an electrical field \"perpendicular\" to the channel walls. This has the effect of altering the motive force experienced by the mobile liquid atoms in the double layer. This change in the zeta-potential can be used to control both the magnitude and direction of the electro-osmotic flow in the microchannel.\n\nThe controlling voltage need only be in the range of 50 V for a typical microfluidic channel, since this correlates to a gradient of 1.5 MV/cm due to the channel size.\n\nVariation of the FlowFET dimensions (e.g. insulating layer thickness between the channel wall and gate electrode) due to the manufacturing process can lead to inexact control of the zeta potential. This can be exacerbated in the case of wall contamination, which can alter the channel wall surface's electrical properties adjacent to the gate electrode. This will affect the local flow characteristics, which may be especially important in chemical synthesis systems whose stoichiometry are directly related to the transport rate of reaction precursors and reaction products.\n\nThere are constraints placed on the fluid that can be manipulated in a FlowFET. Since it relies on EOF, only fluids producing an EOF in response to an applied electric field may be used.\n\nWhile the controlling voltage need only be on the order of 50V, the EOF-producing voltage along the channel axis is larger, on the order of 300V. It is noticed experimentally that electrolysis may occur at the electrode contacts. This water electrolysis can alter the pH in the channel and adversely affect biological cells and biomolecules, while gas bubbles tend to \"clog\" microfluidic systems.\n\nIn further analogy with microelectronic systems, the switching time for a flowFET is inversely proportional to its size. Scaling down a flowFET results in a reduction in the amount of time for the flow to equilibrate to a new flow rate following a change in the applied electrical field. It should be noted, however, that the frequency of flowFET is many orders of magnitude slower than with an electronic FET.\n\nA FlowFET sees potential uses in massively parallel microfluidic manipulation, for example in DNA microarrays.\n\nWithout using a FlowFET, it is necessary to control the rate of EOF by changing the magnitude of the EOF-producing field (i.e. the field parallel to the channel's axis) while leaving the zeta potential unaltered. In this arrangement, however, simultaneous control of EOF in channels connected with each other cannot easily be accomplished.\n\nA FlowFET provides a way of controlling microfluidic flow in a way that uses no moving parts. This is in stark contrast to other solutions including pneumatically-actuated peristaltic pumps such as presented by Wu et al. Fewer moving parts allows less opportunity for mechanical breakdown of a microfluidic device. This may be increasingly relevant as large future iterations of large microelectronic fluidic (MEF) arrays continue to increase in size and complexity.\n\nThe use of bi-directional electronically-controlled flow has interesting options for particle and bubble cleaning operations.\n"}
{"id": "302040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302040", "title": "Game Genie", "text": "Game Genie\n\nGame Genie is the name of a line of video game cheat cartridges originally designed by Codemasters and sold by Camerica and Galoob. The first device in the series was released in 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, with subsequent devices released for the Super NES, Game Boy, Genesis, and Game Gear. All the devices temporarily modify game data, manipulate various aspects of games, and sometimes access unused assets and functions. Five million units of the original Game Genie products were sold worldwide, and most video game console emulators feature Game Genie code support. Emulators that have Game Genie support also allow a near-unlimited number of codes to be entered whereas the actual products have a much smaller limit, between three and six codes.\n\nIn mid-1993 Codemasters began development on a \"Game Genie 2\", with Galoob again due to market and distribute the device in North America, but ultimately no Game Genie devices were released by Codemasters for the fifth generation of consoles. However, other companies have produced similar hacking devices such as the Code Breaker and GameShark. The Game Genie brand was later revived by the company Hyperkin, who released cheat systems for newer consoles.\n\nThe original Game Genie systems were pass-through devices that attached between a cartridge and the console. Upon starting the console, the player is presented with a menu that they can use to enter a series of characters referred to as a \"code\", that reference addresses in the ROM of the cartridge. Each code contains an integer value that is read by the system in place of the data actually present on the cartridge. The Game Genie is covered by US Patent #5112051, \"Interfacing device for a computer games system\", filed May 30, 1990. This patent expired on May 30, 2010, according to current US patent law.\n\nBecause the Game Genie patches the program code of a game, the codes are sometimes referred to as patch codes. These codes can have a variety of effects. Most published codes give the player some form of invulnerability, infinite ammunition, level skipping, or other modifications that allow the player to be more powerful than intended by the developers. In rare cases, codes can make the game more difficult or even unlock hidden game features that developers had scrapped and rendered unreachable in normal play.\n\nThe Game Genie sold with a booklet of codes for use with various games available for the system. However, new codes continued to be developed and new games were released after these booklets were published. To address this, Galoob created a paid subscription service where subscribers would receive quarterly code updates. In addition, Galoob also ran ads in certain gaming publications, such as \"GamePro\", that featured codes for newer games.\n\nTo create new codes, it is possible to enter random codes into a Game Genie. This evolutionary approach is equivalent to using random POKE operations. Usually, entering random codes will result in no noticeable change in the game or freezing the game and possibly corrupting save data, but a useful difference may appear in the game if this process is repeated many times. One must write down the random codes for each attempt because there is no method to view the codes after starting the game. Once a useful code is discovered, making slight modifications to this code has a much higher probability of producing additional useful codes. With ROM files, emulators, and decompilers for these games and systems, it has become possible to reverse engineer games to find specific ROM data to modify. This information can be directly converted into Game Genie codes.\n\nThe Game Genie attaches to the end of the NES cartridge, causing the cartridge to protrude from the console when fully inserted, making the depression impossible. Therefore, the Game Genie was designed in such a way that it did not need to be depressed in order to start the game. This design put even more stress on the LIF socket than standard game insertion, bending pins and eventually causing units to be unplayable without the Game Genie present.\n\nThe design of the Game Genie also made it very difficult to insert into a newer top-loading NES without pressing very hard. An adapter was created to deal with the problem, which Galoob offered to Game Genie owners free of charge, but few were requested, and the stock was liquidated.\n\nThere also exists a version of the Game Genie for the Family Computer, distributed by Realtec and sold in Latin American countries.\n\nInitially the Game Genie did not work with Super NES games that contain a performance enhancing chip, but did offer an updated version to address these problems with some games such as \"\". The Game Genie remains incompatible with certain games, such as \"Star Fox\" and \"\", because those games use the extra pins that most other Super NES games never utilize, as there is no circuitry to accommodate these pins of the games' PCBs. It also has problems with the SNS-101 remodel SNES. When used with a SNS-101, only two codes can be used at a time, and they must be entered on the top and bottom lines of the Game Genie menu. There are three known versions of the SNES Game Genie (v1, v1.1, v2). Images of v1 and v2 PCB have been posted and the difference is night and day, with v2 containing much fewer components on the PCB. All three versions look exactly the same from the outside but when v1.1 is booted up, it will have dashes present before any code is entered. The only way to tell v1 and v2 apart is by opening the cart and checking the PCB.\n\nThe Game Boy edition similarly has a slot for cartridges while itself needing to be inserted into the console's game slot. It has two face buttons for toggling codes on/off or to return to the code input screen, and it houses a compartment to contain a very small code booklet in the back.\n\nThe physical design made it difficult to be used with any version of the Game Boy other than the original. Although it could be made to work, if one attempted to use the Game Genie on the Game Boy Pocket or Game Boy Color, they would find the large top portion of the Game Genie would come into contact with the top of the Game Boy Pocket/Color before it was fully engaged. Therefore, the Game Genie would need to be bent backwards, placing strain on the mechanism to allow it to be pressed down far enough to reach the Game Boy Pocket/Color cartridge contacts. Despite this history, it will work fairly well with the Game Boy Advance SP. A standard unit will not fit in a Super Game Boy, but with some minor modification to the plastic, it will fit and work normally. There was also a third party \"Super Game Boy to Game Genie Adapter\", allowing the player to connect the Game Genie to a Super Game Boy cartridge.\n\nThe unit is also not compatible with Game Boy Color cartridges (which will not physically fit into the unit). This, however, includes original Game Boy games with Game Boy Color enhancements, when played in a Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance system. However, color enhanced games will function if played in an original Game Boy system.\n\nOn the Genesis/Mega Drive, the Game Genie can function as a country converter cartridge since most of these games are only \"locked\" to their respective regions by the shape of the cartridges and a set of a few bytes in the header of the ROM.\nSome games do not work with the Genesis Game Genie; see \"legal issues\" below.\n\nThe Game Gear version of the Game Genie had a more complicated design than those for other systems. When inserted into the cartridge slot, another slot would pop-up to insert the Game Gear cartridge. It also had a compartment which contained a book of codes. The codes were printed on sticky labels to put on the back of the Game Gear cartridge. When entering codes, the player could easily see what to type in rather than looking through the book.\n\nOn the screen in which a code is entered for the Game Gear Game Genie, a player typing the word \"DEAD\" will cause the screen to move up and down, possibly as an Easter egg.\n\nSome games do not work with the Game Genie (see \"legal issues\" below).\n\nThe introduction of the original NES Game Genie was met by fierce opposition from Nintendo. Nintendo then sued Galoob in the case \"Galoob v. Nintendo\", claiming that the Game Genie created derivative works in violation of copyright law. Sales of the Game Genie initially stopped in the U.S., but not in Canada. In many gaming magazines of the time, Galoob placed Game Genie ads saying \"Thank You Canada!\" However, after the courts found that use of the Game Genie did not result in a derivative work, Nintendo could do nothing to stop the Game Genie from being sold in the U.S. Before the lawsuit was filed, Galoob offered to make the Game Genie an officially licensed product but was turned down by Nintendo.\n\nAround the time of the lawsuit from Galoob, Nintendo tried to use other methods to thwart the Game Genie, using ROM checksums in later titles intended to detect the cheat modifications. These measures were partially successful but some could be bypassed with additional codes. Later versions of the Game Genie had the ability to hide Genie modifications from checksum routines.\n\nSega, on the other hand, was a full endorser of the Game Genie, with their official seal of approval. One of Sega's requirements for this, however, was that the Game Genie wouldn't work with games that have a save feature, such as the \"Phantasy Star\" or \"Shining Force\" series.\n\nA substantially more powerful device was developed by Codemasters for the Super NES, with many improvements including the ability for users to find their own cheat codes, to selectively activate cheats during gameplay using the game controller, to switch games into a slow-motion mode, as well as automatically save and restore the high-scores from games into battery-backed memory on the Game Genie device itself. A fully working prototype of the device was completed, but was not brought to market due to changes in market conditions. One prototype is known to remain in existence, in the possession of Richard Aplin, one of the original creators.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53995681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53995681", "title": "Genetically encoded voltage indicator", "text": "Genetically encoded voltage indicator\n\nGenetically encoded voltage indicator (or GEVI) is a protein that can sense membrane potential in a cell and relate the change in voltage to a form of output, often fluorescent level. It is a promising optogenetic recording tool that enables exporting electrophysiological signals from cultured cells, live animals, and ultimately human brain. Examples of notable GEVIs include ArcLight, ASAP1, ASAP2s, and Ace2N-mNeon.\n\nDespite that the idea of optical measurement of neuronal activity was proposed in the late 1960s, the first successful GEVI that was convenient enough to put into actual use was not developed until technologies of genetic engineering had become mature in the late 1990s. The first GEVI, coined FlaSh, was constructed by fusing a modified green fluorescent protein with a voltage-sensitive K channel (Shaker). Unlike fluorescent proteins, the discovery of new GEVIs were seldomly inspired by the nature, for it is hard to find an organism which naturally has the ability to change its fluorescence based on voltage. Therefore, new GEVIs are mostly the products of genetic and protein engineering.\n\nTwo methods can be utilized to find novel GEVIs: rational design and directed evolution. The former method contributes to the most of new GEVI variants, but recent researches using directed evolution have shown promising results in GEVI optimization.\n\nGEVI can have many configuration designs in order to realize voltage sensing function. An essential feature of GEVI structure is that it must situate on the cell membrane. Conceptually, the structure of a GEVI should permit the function of sensing the voltage difference and reporting it by change in fluorescence. Usually, the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) of a GEVI spans across the membrane, and is connected to the fluorescent protein(s). However, it is not necessary that sensing and reporting should happen in different structures, e.g. Arch.\n\nBy structure, GEVIs can be classified into four categories based on the current findings: (1) GEVIs contain a fluorescent protein FRET pair, e.g. VSFP1, (2) Single opsion GEVIs, e.g. Arch, (3) Opsin-FP FRET pair GEVIs, e.g. MacQ-mCitrine, (4) single FP with special types of voltage sensing domains, e.g. ASAP1. A majority of GEVIs are based on the \"Ciona intestinalis\" voltage sensitive phosphatase (Ci-VSP or Ci-VSD (domain)), which was discovered in 2005 from the genomic survey of the organism. Some GEVIs might have similar components, but with different positioning of them. For example, ASAP1 and ArcLight both use a VSD and one FP, but the FP of ASAP1 is on the outside of the cell whereas that of ArcLight is on the inside, and the two FPs of VSFP-Butterfly are separated by the VSD, while the two FPs of Mermaid are relatively close to each other. \n\nA GEVI can be evaluated by its many characteristics. These traits can be classified into two categories: performance and compatibility. The performance properties include brightness, photostability, sensitivity, kinetics (speed), linearity of response, etc., while the compatibility properties cover toxicity (phototoxicity), plasma membrane localization, adaptability of deep-tissue imaging, etc. For now, no existing GEVI meets all the desired properties, so searching for a perfect GEVI is still a quite competitive research area.\n\nDifferent types of GEVIs are seen being used in many biological or physiological research areas. It is thought to be superior to conventional voltage detecting methods like electrode-based electrophysiological recordings, calcium imaging, or voltage sensitive dyes. It can show neuron signals with subcellular spatial resolution. It has fast temporal resolution (sub-millisecond), matching or surpassing that of the electrode recordings, and about one magnitude faster than calcium imaging. Researchers have used it to probe neural communications of an intact brain (of \"Drosophila\" or mouse), electrical spiking of bacteria (\"E. coli\"), and human stem-cell derived cardiomyocyte.\n"}

At the time in Italy, divorce was not permitted and adultery was still a crime. Occhini herself was tried for abandoning her marriage. Her story became emblematic of the conformist and repressive climate of that period.\n\nHer nickname originated after the 1954 St. Moritz stage of the Giro d'Italia, when Pierre Chany, a journalist with \"L'Équipe\", wrote: \"We would like to know more about that lady in white (\"dame en blanc\") we saw near Coppi,” referring to the snow-coloured duffel coat she wore.\n\nOcchini was married to Enrico Locatelli, a medical practitioner in Varano Borghi, and who was a passionate fan of Coppi. She met Fausto Coppi during the 1953 Tour at the end of the Passo dello Stelvio stage and publicly appeared with the \"Campionissimo\" at the World Championships Prize 1953 in Lugano. Their friendship started in 1948 when the Locatelli had asked his wife to obtain an autograph of the \"Campionissimo\" at the end of the Tre Valli Varesine. Later Occhini entered into correspondence with Coppi, who, solicited by Locatelli, personally met his family in a short visit to Varese. A romance began between Occhini and Coppi and they spent the summer together as lovers in 1953, vacationing in Capri.\n\nSince they were both married, the relationship aroused great scandal at that time and was strongly opposed by public opinion, particularly by Fausto Coppi's fans, and Occhini was even the recipient of Pope Pius XII's public condemnation. Coppi and his wife, Bruna Ciampolini, unanimously separated in 1954, while Locatelli denounced Occhini for adultery. As a result of this, according to Italian law of time, the lovers having been caught “in flagrante”, the woman was punished with a month's imprisonment in Alessandria and then a period of house arrest in Ancona. Coppi’s passport was withdrawn. Among these many difficulties, Coppi and Occhini married in Mexico (a marriage never recognized in Italy) and Occhini gave birth to a son, Angelo Fausto Coppi, who was born on May 13, 1955 in Buenos Aires.\n\nGiulia Occhini died on January 6, 1993. After almost a year and a half of coma. She had been admitted to San Giacomo Hospital in Novi Ligure following injuries sustained in a car accident that occurred just in front of Villa Coppi in hamlet Barbellotta of Novi Ligure on 3 August 1991 on board a Fiat Tipo, driven by a family friend, who was hit by a Volkswagen Golf GTI with two young people on board. Giulia Occhini is buried in the new graveyard of Serravalle Scrivia, next to her daughter Loretta \"Lolli\" Locatelli (1946-1981), who died of leukemia.\n\n\n"}

After spending time building railways, he moved to Iowa, where was elected to the State Senate. He became head of a manufacturer's association, and was appointed to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1894 by President Grover Cleveland. Yeomans was reappointed by President William McKinley and then by Theodore Roosevelt. He retired from the commission in 1905 and spent time pursuing his business interests until he died in Washington DC in 1906.\n\nYeomans was born in Bennington, New York and educated in the public schools there. In 1862, he obtained a job with the Erie Railroad Company, and served two years with the company. He then went to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and worked on railroads for the Federal Government for the remainder of the American Civil War.\n\nYeomans returned to the Northeast after the war. In 1872, he became assistant superintendent of the Buffalo, New York and Philadelphia Railway, and a year later was made its superintendent.

He initially made his name in racing on two wheels, winning the Swiss 350 cc motorcycle championship in 1959, before switching to four wheels with a Formula Junior Stanguellini. Siffert graduated to Formula One as a privateer in 1962, with a four-cylinder Lotus-Climax. He later moved to Swiss team Scuderia Filipinetti, and in 1964 joined Rob Walker's private British Rob Walker Racing Team. Early successes included victories in the non-Championship 1964 and 1965 Mediterranean Grands Prix, both times beating Jim Clark by a very narrow margin. He won two races in Formula One for the Rob Walker Racing Team and BRM. He died at the 1971 World Championship Victory Race, having his car roll over after a crash caused by a mechanical failure and being caught under the burning vehicle. Siffert was married twice and to his second wife Simone during the height of his career in the late 1960s and at the time of his death. They had two children together, Véronique and Philippe.\n\nIn 1968, Siffert drove into the F1 history books by winning the 1968 British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch in Rob Walker Racing Team's Lotus 49B, beating Chris Amon's Ferrari into second place after a race-long battle. This is regarded as the last GP victory by a genuine privateer.\n\nWhile Siffert's status in F1 grew slowly, his fame came as a leading driver for the factory Porsche effort in its quest for the World Sportscar Championship. In 1968, Siffert and Hans Herrmann won the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring in a Porsche 907, marking the first major outright wins for the company, apart from a few earlier victories on twisty tracks.\n\nLater on, Siffert's driving displays in the Porsche 917 earned him several major wins in Europe. In addition, Siffert was chosen by Porsche to help launch its CanAm development programme, driving a Porsche 917PA spyder in 1969 and finishing fourth in the championship despite few entries.\n\nIn 1970 he teamed up with Brian Redman to drive a Porsche 908/3 to victory at the Targa Florio. That same year, Porsche bankrolled Siffert's seat in a works March Engineering F1 since the German company did not wish to lose one of their prize drivers to rival Ferrari. His association with March in F1 was disastrous, so he was pleased to join rival Porsche racer Pedro Rodriguez at BRM the following season.\n\nSiffert won the 1971 Austrian Grand Prix, and was later killed in the non-championship World Championship Victory Race at Brands Hatch, Kent, England, the scene of his first victory in 1968. The suspension of his BRM had been damaged in a lap one incident with Ronnie Peterson, and broke later. This was not admitted by BRM until much later when it was accidentally divulged by a BRM ex-mechanic. The BRM crashed and immediately caught fire. Siffert could not free himself from the burning car.\n\nThis accident led to a rapid overhaul of safety, both in-car and on circuit. In the subsequent Royal Automobile Club (the UK organising and regulatory representative of the FIA at the time) investigation, it was discovered that the crash itself caused non-fatal injuries but Siffert had rather been killed by smoke inhalation. None of the trackside fire extinguishers worked, and it was found to be impossible to reach the car and extract Siffert because of the intense fire. On-board fire extinguishers (using BCF—bromochlorodifluoromethane, an aircraft product) became mandatory and also piped air for the drivers, direct into their helmets.\n\nHis funeral in Switzerland was attended by 50,000 people and a Gulf-Porsche 917 of Team John Wyer led the hearse and procession through the streets of Fribourg. Benoit was a period Formula 1 sports reporter and knew Siffert well. He was also present at Siffert's tragic last Brands Hatch race in 1971. The night before the race, Benoit took pictures of Siffert, his wife Simone and his mother Maria as well as a friend Jean Tinguely at an evening victory celebration. He then also took the very last picture of Siffert alive as he sat waiting in his BRM in the pole position on the starting line five minutes before the start of the race.\n\nIn the final round of the 2007–08 A1GP season, at Brands Hatch, the A1 Team Switzerland car carried the message \"Jo 'Seppi' Siffert - 40th Anniversary - Brands Hatch\".

He is a former unified light-welterweight world champion, having held the WBA (Unified), IBF, and IBO titles between 2016 and 2017. As an amateur, Indongo represented Namibia at the 2008 Olympics, reaching the first round of the lightweight bracket.\n\nIndongo first took up boxing at the age of 17. In 2002, he won the amateur Namibian National Championships and he appeared poised for success. However, Indongo was struck by tuberculosis, which interrupted his career for 2 years. After recovering, Indongo qualified to represent his country in the 2008 Olympics. Right before his first fight, Indongo broke his right hand. He decided to fight regardless but was easily outpointed by Anthony Little.\n\nIndongo debuted professionally at the age of 25, on 25 July 2009, with a points decision (PTS) win over Pohamba Mandume. After winning his first six fights, he won his first regional title, the Namibian lightweight title, by defeating Samuel Kapapu, and retained it against Peter Malakia.\n\nAfter improving to 14 consecutive wins, he won the WBO Africa light-welterweight title in October 2012 via victory over James Onyango. Indongo went on to make six successful defenses of that title between 2014 and 2016. Indongo was a late bloomer on the world stage, with his first world title fight taking place when he was 33. His trainer, Nestor Tobias, stated that he often needed to be more aggressive and \"deliver the killer punch\".\n\nIn October 2016, undefeated IBF and IBO light-welterweight champion Eduard Troyanovsky (25-0, 22 KOs) stated he would make a voluntary defence on the Lebedev-Gassiev card in Russia on 3 December. On 7 November, Indongo, who was ranked WBO #3, WBA #15 and IBF #10, was announced as his opponent, for the fight to take place in Moscow, in his first bout held outside of Namibia. Despite being a favoured underdog, Indongo knocked out Troyanovsky after only forty seconds of the first round with a left hook, becoming Namibia's fourth world boxing champion. Troyanovsky was badly hurt from the shot and did not get up. Referee Mark Calo-Oy immediately halted the fight with Troyanovsky still down on the canvas. After some assistance, they eventually got Troyanovsky back to his feet and took him out of the ring.\n\nIn late December, there were talks for a potential unification fight between Indongo and WBA champion Ricky Burns. On 9 January, Burns' manager Tommy Morrison confirmed a deal was being put together for Burns to fight Indongo in a unification fight in April at The SSE Hydro in Glasgow. On 11 January, Sky Sports confirmed a deal was reached for Burns and Indongo in a unification title bout on 15 April 2017. The WBA, IBF and IBO titles would be at stake. This was Scotland's first ever unification fight. Burns failed to become Scotland's first unified world champion when he lost a via a one-sided unanimous decision with wide scores of 120-108, 118-110 and 116-112. In the last two rounds, Burns hit the canvas three times, but these were ruled as a slip. Following the defeat, Burns praised Indongo, \"He was so so awkward. He was a lot better than we thought he was going to be. He can hit as well.\" He also said that he wouldn't retire.\n\nOn 1 July 2017, Top Rank announced that a light welterweight unification fight between Indongo and WBC, WBO, \"Ring\" magazine, and lineal champion Terence Crawford was agreed to take place on 19 August at the Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln, Nebraska live on ESPN in US and Sky Sports in the UK. The projected unification of every major world title in boxing (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO, \"The Ring\", and lineal) will determine the light welterweight division's first undisputed champion since Kostya Tszyu in 2004, and the first time all the aforementioned titles have been at stake in a single fight since Bernard Hopkins vs. Jermain Taylor in 2005. Both fighters paid over $100,000 US dollars in sanctioning fees. Indongo vacated the IBO belt to avoid paying even more in sanctioning fees. Crawford entered the fight as a heavy favourite to win.\n\nOn fight night, Crawford blasted Indongo, knocking him down in the second round before finishing him with a vicious body shot in just three rounds. The fight took place in front of a raucous home crowd for Crawford. Crawford landed 27 total punches to Indongo's 13 and 17 power punches to Indongo's 10. Following the fight, Indongo stated \"When he hit me like that, my mind was gone\" about Crawford's body shot. According to CompuBox stats, Crawford landed 26 of his 75 punches thrown (35%), while Indongo landed 13 of 74 thrown (18%). Both boxers earned an undisclosed 7-figure purse. Following the fight, Indongo stated \"When he hit me like that, my mind was gone\" about Crawford's body shot. Crawford stated that he had yet to make a decision on the next step in his career but there was speculation about him moving up to the welterweight division or defending his light welterweight titles against Mikey Garcia. The card averaged 965,000 viewers on ESPN.\n\nOn 5 January 2018, Lou DiBella of DiBella Entertainment announced that he had signed Indongo on a long-term promotional contract. A few hours later, Nestor Tobias, Indongo's manager and promoter from Namibia claimed that Indongo and DiBella had breached contract. Tobias stated that Indongo was under contract with his MTC Nestor Sunshine Boxing & Fitness Academy until 2020.\n\nThe WBC super lightweight title became vacant after Terence Crawford decided to move up to welterweight. It was announced that number 1 ranked Amir Imam would fight number 3 ranked Jose Ramirez for the vacant title. WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman then announced that Viktor Postol, who was ranked number 4, would fight number 2 ranked Regis Prograis (20-0, 17 KOs) for the interim WBC title. The winner of both fights would then meet to become the full titleholder. In January 2018, a deal was finally reached for the fight between Postol and Prograis to take place on 9 March at the Buffalo Run Casino in Miami, Florida. On 12 February, ESPN reported that Postol suffered a fractured thumb and forced to drop out of the bout. Indongo was announced as his replacement, with the bout still taking place on 9 March, however the venue was changed to Deadwood Mountain Grand, a casino and resort in Deadwood, South Dakota, with Showtime televising the bout live. Prograis knocked Indongo down four times in the fight, dropping him once in round 1 and three more times in round 2 before referee Ian John Lewis stopped the fight at 2:54 of round 2. Indongo started the fight well before being hit with a hard jab that dropped him. Indongo was hurt with this shot. Indongo fought close to Prograis, which seemed to benefit Prograis. After the fight, Prograis told Showtime's Steve Farhood, “After the first round, I felt his punches. He couldn't punch. He couldn’t hurt me. I got a little reckless. But, I got the job done, so I can’t complain.” Prograis landed 46 of 94 punches thrown (49%) and Indongo connected on 32 of his 120 thown (27%).\n\n"}

He was the son of Khosrow II. He became king after orchestrating a coup d'état against his father.\n\nKavadh II was the son of Khosrow II, the king of the Sasanian Empire, and Maria, daughter of Maurice, the emperor of the Byzantine Empire. Kavadh was later imprisoned by his father, who wanted to ensure the succession of his favorite son Mardanshah, the son of his favorite wife, Shirin.\nHis father's reputation had been ruined during the last phase of the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628. In 627, the Sasanian general Rhahzadh was slain and Dastgerd, the king's favorite residence, had been sacked into oblivion by Byzantine emperor Heraclius, who was advancing towards the nearby Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon (both in present Iraq). In 628, Kavadh was released by the feudal families of the Sasanian Empire, which included the Ispahbudhan \"spahbed\" (army chief) Farrukh Hormizd and his two sons Rostam Farrokhzad and Farrukhzad, Shahrbaraz of the House of Mihran, the Armenian faction represented by Varaztirots II Bagratuni and finally the Kanarang.\n\nOn 25 February, Kavadh, along with Aspad Gushnasp, captured Ctesiphon and imprisoned Khosrow II. Kavadh II then proclaimed himself as king of the Sasanian Empire and ordered the execution of all his brothers and half-brothers, which included his main rival Mardanshah, the favorite son of Khosrow II. Three days later he ordered Mihr Hormozd to execute his father. However, after the regicide of his father, Kavadh had Mihr Hormozd killed.\n\nWith the agreement of the Persian nobles, Kavadh then made peace with the victorious emperor Heraclius, which awarded the Byzantines to (re)gain all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, along with the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.\n\nKavadh also appointed Armenian nobleman Varaztirots II Bagratuni as Marzban (margrave and military viceroy) of Persian Armenia, and appointed Ishoyahb II (628–645) as the new Catholicos (Eastern Patriarch) of the Nestorian Church of the East (at Seleucia-Ctesiphon).\nKavadh II later died from plague after a few months' reign on 6 September 628. He was succeeded by his eight-year-old son Ardashir III, for whom he decreed Emperor Heraclius act as regent. These decisions along with his Christian faith (from his mother) led the Zoroastrian priesthood to eliminate him and his young heir not long after.\n\nA passage of the Chronicle of Edessa identifies \"Anzoy the Roman\" as the wife of Kavadh II and mother of Ardashir III. She was probably a Christian princess from the Byzantine Empire.\n\nSiroe is the subject of operas by a number of composers on a libretto by Metastasio, including Pasquale Errichelli, Johann Adolph Hasse, Leonardo Vinci, Antonio Vivaldi and George Frideric Handel. He is also identified as Solomon of Persia by the Alians.\n\n"}
{"id": "1199133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1199133", "title": "Kermit Washington", "text": "Kermit Washington\n\nKermit Alan Washington (born September 17, 1951) is an American former professional basketball player. Washington is best remembered for punching opposing player Rudy Tomjanovich during an on-court fight in 1977. His punch nearly killed Tomjanovich, and resulted in severe medical problems that ultimately ended Tomjanovich's playing career. \n\nWashington was not a highly coveted player coming out of high school and barely got into college on an athletic scholarship. He averaged a mere four points per game (ppg) during his senior season of high school. He improved rapidly once at American University, and became one of only seven players in NCAA history to average 20 points and 20 rebounds throughout the course of their career.\n\nA big defensive forward, Washington was known for his ability to gather rebounds. He averaged 9.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game in ten National Basketball Association (NBA) seasons and played in the All-Star Game once. Washington was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers with the fifth overall pick in the 1973 NBA draft. He played sparingly his first three seasons, and sought the help of retired basketball coach Pete Newell before his fourth season. Under Newell's tutelage, Washington's game rapidly improved and he became a starter for several teams. He played for the Lakers, Boston Celtics, San Diego Clippers, Portland Trail Blazers and Golden State Warriors.\n\nKermit Washington's mother Barbara graduated from Miner's Teacher's College (later subsumed into Howard University), where she was an excellent student; his father Alexander was an X-ray technician. Washington had a rough childhood. When he was three years old, his parents had a fight in which his maternal uncle became involved and in which someone violently attacked his uncle with an iron. His parents soon divorced, with his father awarded custody of the children. His mother, who suffered from bipolar disorder, then took him and his older brother Eric from their father on an ill-advised sojourn for which they were poorly prepared. Struggling to find money to feed the children, she eventually called their father, who came and took them back. His stay with his father did not last long, and he and his brother were passed around to various relatives on both sides of the family.\n\nThe effect of being shuttled into and out of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth. The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while. According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive. After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying \"I thought it was our dream come true. All our lives we had seen nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family.\" However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother. As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, Chris. Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood. He had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades. When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.\n\nAs a senior in high school, Washington stood but weighed a mere 150 lbs. After some rare positive feedback by his biology teacher, Barbara Thomas, he began to study and put forth a greater effort in that class. He quickly became a solid student in biology but poor in all other subjects. When Thomas became his home room teacher and saw his grades in other classes she encouraged him to try hard in all of his courses. Washington rapidly improved his marks, making the honor roll in his senior year.\n\nHis basketball performance in high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated from high school he would be thrown out of the house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day toward the end of his senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at the University of Maryland to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.\n\nDuring the summer between his senior year of high school and his freshman year of college, Washington grew four inches. He began an intense regimen of weight training, and ran up and down the flights of steps in his seven-story dormitory building wearing a weighted vest to improve his endurance. Washington became more extroverted in college, so much so that he later said his life could be separated into two parts—his pre-college life and his life after college. He has frequently described his college years as \"the happiest time in my life.\" He began dating his future wife Pat when he was a freshman. They met after she noticed him accidentally scoring four consecutive points for the opposing team in a freshman basketball game. She pursued him even though he often remained silent when she spent time with him. A lot of the emergence of Washington's personality is credited to Pat, who encouraged him to be more outgoing and overcome his low self-esteem. Washington spent a lot of his free time practicing in the gym. He played playground basketball in the summer, and was on several Urban League teams. He averaged 19.4 points and 22.3 rebounds on his freshman team at American. Pat helped him with his grades—despite the fact that he had done well his senior year of high school he was still far behind; he did not even know what a paragraph was when he entered college or how to write a report.\n\nHe averaged 18.6 points on 46.8 percent shooting and 20.5 rebounds in his first year of varsity basketball. He still played a somewhat unaggressive or \"soft\" brand of basketball, and it was hurting his chances of being drafted by a professional team. Between his sophomore and junior years he began lifting weights with Trey Coleman, a former football player from the University of Nebraska who was studying as an undergrad at American. Coleman encouraged him to be more aggressive on the court, and Washington told him that it was not in his nature. Coleman admonished him, telling him he could not afford to be \"cool\" on the court given his talent level if he wanted to join the pro ranks. Washington was named an academic All-American his junior year. He averaged 21.0 points on 54.4 percent shooting and an NCAA-leading 19.8 rebounds in his junior season. He was drafted after his junior season by the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and offered a four-year contract for $100,000 a year, which astonished him. He decided to stay at American with coach Young for his senior season because he felt he owed the school which had given him a chance when he was coming out of a difficult period in high school. He was offered an invite to try for the 1972 Olympic basketball team after the season, but did not make the squad.\n\nWashington was one of the best players in the country going into his senior season. He marveled at newspaper reports in the \"Washington Post\" that mentioned \"coaches of opposing teams and how they were planning to stop \"Kermit Washington\".\" He led the nation in rebounding again in his senior season. He was a second team All-American, and helped American into the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). In the last game of his college career, Washington needed to score 39 points to average 20 points and 20 rebounds a game for his career in college. He became extremely nervous before the game and could neither eat nor sleep. The game set American University attendance records, and Washington felt light on his feet when he was introduced before the raucous crowd. He managed to score 40 points and in so doing, became just the seventh player to reach the 20/20 mark. He was thrown a party, and there was a campus wide celebration after the game. He graduated with a 3.37 GPA and a degree in sociology. Washington was a two-time Academic All-American, who taught courses in social sciences his senior year.\n\nWashington was drafted fifth overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1973 NBA draft. A week before the team began training camp, Pat and Kermit were married. They invited neither of their families; they just drove together to LA's city hall for the ceremony. He had a difficult time making the transition from college center to NBA power forward. In basketball, many players succeed in high school and college due to superior physical skills, but when they arrive in the professional ranks, they are typically going against players that are often as physically gifted as them. Washington also had played in a primarily zone defense system in college and was not versed in man-to-man defense, which is more common in the NBA. He arrived on a team which had legend Jerry West, who was in the waning stages of a career that would result in him becoming the silhouette seen on the NBA's logo. Washington admits that he was terrified of West, and felt anxiety every time he made a mistake in front of him. Though healthy, he played in only 45 games and averaged 8.9 minutes a game his rookie season. He hurt his back that year but kept quiet about it, fearing he would be \"labeled soft.\" The injury would bother him the rest of his career. He continued to struggle in his second season, and discovered that finding individual coaching in the professional game at that time was difficult. Between the rigorous schedule, and the coaches assuming players already knew how to play for the most part when they entered the league, no one, including head coach Bill Sharman, was willing to work with him on a one-on-one basis.\nEntering his fourth season, Washington knew the only thing keeping him in the league was his guaranteed contract and that the Lakers had essentially written him off. The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills, so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies. Washington was particularly disturbed when in a game against Golden State, he got into an awkward collision with Rick Barry, upon which Barry remarked: \"Listen, you better learn how to play this game.\" The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry's rebuke was correct. Desperate to improve, he contacted Pete Newell at the recommendation of an agent. Newell was a retired pro and college coach who worked in a front office position with the Lakers, and had drafted Washington when he was then the team's GM. In truth, while Newell says he felt some responsibility considering he drafted him, he was involved in many player transactions over the course of his long career, and was not especially attached to Washington. He was surprised by this request, however, and unhappy with his new highly marginalized job within the organization, so Newell agreed to meet Washington for individual drills. He scheduled the practices very early in the morning to test Washington's dedication, thinking a professional athlete would not bother to get up at that hour every day. Washington showed up without complaint and Newell put him through intense training sessions. Newell is often seen as a kind, gentlemanly person, who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the game of basketball. In private practice, however, he could be an intense, unforgiving teacher, and he was even more unforgiving than usual with Washington as he felt that if he were to offer his services for free he would only do so if the player was willing to train maniacally.\n\nNewell had Washington watch tapes of Paul Silas, who was a rebounding forward for the Boston Celtics, and convinced him to have more confidence in his offensive game. He reworked Washington's game from the ground up, and in so doing established a name for himself as a tremendous coach of big men—he would later conduct a yearly \"Big Man Camp\" in Hawaii which was attended by hundreds of NBA players.\n\nLos Angeles had acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Washington's style of play complemented him, as Abdul-Jabbar was not an especially physical player. Washington played well, averaging 9.7 points and 9.3 rebounds; however, he struggled with tendinitis in his knee the entire season. His wife pleaded with him to sit out some games, but he took painkillers and kept playing. Washington finally tore the patella tendon in a late season game against Denver. \"I could feel it tearing inside. I looked down, and my kneecap was hanging on the side of my leg.\" Doctors covered his entire leg in a cast and told him his basketball career was most likely over.\n\nNewell was the person to bring Washington out of the despair Kermit felt when he heard his playing career was probably over. Newell forced him through even more grueling training sessions the following summer, after some of which, Washington strongly considered quitting. His leg had atrophied from the injury and he was scared of re-injuring it during their training sessions. Newell ignored his pleas and told him that if he ever wanted to play again he had to train more than before and work even harder. Washington came back to play the following season and performed well; through the first 25 games he was averaging career highs in points (11.6) and rebounds (10.8). He had been featured in the NBA preview edition of \"Sports Illustrated\" (which was dedicated to enforcers that year) before the season and was praised therein for his intimidating nature and fighting skills. The magazine had posed Washington shirtless in a boxing stance as part of a picture layout entitled, \"Nobody, but Nobody, Is Gonna Hurt My Teammates.\"\n\nOn December 9, 1977, during an NBA game between the Lakers and the Houston Rockets, a scuffle broke out between several players at midcourt.\n\nThe events that precipitated the fight have been frequently debated, and variously interpreted. Two months earlier, on opening night of the season, the Lakers played the Milwaukee Bucks. Bucks center Kent Benson elbowed Abdul-Jabbar in the stomach, and Abdul-Jabbar appeared to be in intense pain. Abdul-Jabbar then punched Benson from behind, breaking Benson's jaw and his own hand. Washington got into a brawl with several Buffalo Braves players a few games later. In the December game, at the beginning of the game's second half, Lakers guard Norm Nixon missed a shot. Houston's Kevin Kunnert and Washington both contended for the rebound, which Kunnert eventually got and passed out to teammate John Lucas. Their battle for the rebound was more physical than usual, however. Abdul-Jabbar became involved and wrestled with Kunnert. As a result, Kermit Washington stayed behind in the backcourt in order to watch over and make sure nothing happened. After the two disengaged, Washington grabbed Kunnert's shorts in order to prevent him from getting back over on offense quickly. Kunnert threw an elbow that hit Washington on the upper arm and this move spun him around so that he was facing Washington. What happened next is disputed: Washington, several Lakers, and Rocket forward Robert Reid insisted that Kunnert punched him, Kunnert said Washington swung first after he attempted to free himself from Washington's grasp. The referee who saw the action saw merely a \"scuffle\" between Kunnert and Abdul-Jabbar followed by the one between Kunnert and Washington then Washington's punch. Both Washington and Abdul-Jabbar reject this account.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar then ran up behind Kunnert and grabbed his arms to try to pull him away from the scuffle. But this only left him defenseless for Washington's first punch, which hit Kunnert in the head and brought him down on one knee.\n\nWashington saw Tomjanovich running toward the altercation. Not knowing that he intended to break up the fight, Washington hit Tomjanovich with a short right-hand punch. The blow, which took Tomjanovich by surprise, fractured his face about one-third of an inch (8 mm) away from his skull and left Tomjanovich unconscious in a pool of blood in the middle of the arena. Abdul-Jabbar likened the sound of the punch to a melon being dropped onto concrete. Tomjanovich had a reputation around the league as a peacemaker. Players involved say that right after Tomjanovich collapsed the absence of sound at the arena, which was filled with shocked fans, was \"the loudest silence you have ever heard.\" Reporters heard the sound of the punch all the way in the second floor press box, and some rushed to the playing floor in disbelief.\n\nTomjanovich was able to get up and walk around, however, and on the way into the locker room he saw Washington. Tomjanovich says that he became aggressive and asked Washington why he punched him. Washington yelled something inaudible about Kunnert, and they were broken up by two security personnel. Tomjanovich was in no condition to fight despite his aggressiveness; besides having the bone structure of his face detached from his skull and suffering a cerebral concussion and broken jaw and nose, he was leaking blood and spinal fluid into his skull capsule. His skull was fractured in such a way that Tomjanovich could taste the spinal fluid leaking into his mouth. He later recalled that at the time of the incident, he believed the scoreboard had fallen on him. The doctor who worked on Tomjanovich said \"I have seen many people with far less serious injuries not make it,\" and likened the surgery to Scotch-taping together a badly shattered eggshell.\n\nWorsening matters for Washington, the only available replay of the incident showed just his punch, not the scuffle that preceded it. This made the attack appear unprovoked, and \"Saturday Night Live\", then watched by an average of 30 to 35 million people, replayed the punch countless times as a gag, having cast member Garrett Morris comically defend the punch. It was also the subject of a \"New York Times\" editorial and investigated on CBS News by Walter Cronkite. Washington was fined $10,000, and suspended for 60 days, missing 26 games; then the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history. The Rockets were furious. Tomjanovich missed the rest of the season and they felt Washington should at least have done likewise.\n\nOn-court fights had been all too common in the 1970s, often including bench-clearing brawls. In the season opener, when Abdul-Jabbar punched Benson, no suspension had been levied. However, Washington's punch resulted in the league enacting strict penalties for on-court fights. Former NBA commissioner David Stern, then the NBA's chief counsel, later said that the incident made NBA officials realize that \"you couldn't allow men that big and that strong to go around throwing punches at each other.\" Currently, any player who throws a punch at another player—even if he misses—is automatically ejected from the game, and suspended for at least his team's next game. The league added a third referee to its game crew after the season; this referee would have trailed the play and could have called a foul when Washington grabbed Kunnert's shorts, thereby potentially stopping the play and preventing the melee that succeeded it.\n\nWashington received no support from the Lakers front office, aside from a single call the day after the fight from Cooke, and was sent torrents of hate mail filled with racial epithets. He was advised by police not to order room service when he played again, as it was feared he would be poisoned. Larry Fleisher, head of the Players' Association, wanted Washington to appeal his suspension, an idea which he originally considered, but ultimately rejected. Although many players around the league sympathized with Washington and said that he had a good reputation off the court, he and his wife became ostracized. They had a two-year-old daughter, and Washington's wife was eight months pregnant with the couple's first son at the time of the punch. His wife recalls she and her children were treated like pariahs after the incident. Her obstetrician refused her service because she was Washington's wife, and her friends asked her what kind of person Washington was that he could commit such an act. The only person who contacted them was Newell. Later in the year Washington went to Newell's home with a big screen television which he insisted Newell accept.\nOn December 27, 1977, just two weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a longtime fan of Washington's. His wife, Pat, stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. He pulled himself together, and began running up and down the flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.\n\nYears later, Jerry West, who was the Lakers coach at the time, told John Feinstein he still wanted Washington on the roster. Then-general manager Bill Sharman said he was \"on the fence.\" Cooke, however, decided to move on.\n\nWashington started alongside Hall of Fame center Dave Cowens, who enjoyed playing with Washington, remarking, \"It's great fun, you can always hear him grunt when he's rebounding.\" Auerbach said, \"Kermit was fighting a battle he couldn't win. Nothing he could say or do was going to change the way people perceived him because of that moment. I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted.\" Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of \"The Boston Globe\" wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.\n\nKunnert signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.\n\nWashington and Kunnert became involved in one of the more unusual player transactions in NBA history. Celtics owner Irv Levin wanted to move closer to his home, and business interests, in California but also wanted continue to own an NBA team. To solve this problem, he and John Y. Brown, Jr., owner of the Buffalo Braves NBA team, exchanged franchises. Washington and Kunnert were two of four Celtics sent to Buffalo as part of the deal. Levin then moved the Buffalo Braves to San Diego, where they were renamed the San Diego Clippers.\n\nIn November 1978, San Diego played in Houston. Tomjanovich scored 26 points and collected 11 rebounds while Washington had six and two. Before the game, the Clippers coach, Gene Shue, had suggested to the Rockets coach, Tom Nissalke, that the players shake hands at center court prior to tipoff. Tomjanovich rejected the idea.\n\nAfter a year in San Diego, Washington was traded again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert, and Randy Smith to Portland in exchange for Walton. This became the second time Washington and Kunnert were part of the same trade. \n\nPortland had strongly desired Washington, and their general manager Stu Inman, was a close friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.\n\nDuring the same off-season, Tomjanovich and the Rockets' civil suit vs. the Lakers occurred. Houston's side argued that Los Angeles had failed to control Washington. During the trial, numerous players and coaches who were at the game testified, while Washington sat at the defense table, listening to himself be portrayed as a dangerous rogue. Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington's testimony, angrily branding him a liar. While the two were playing for San Diego, their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on his team to prevent him from suing him. Jack Ramsay, Portland's coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center Swen Nater when his team was asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered fair compensation for Walton.\n\nWashington shared time at the Trail Blazers power forward spot with Maurice Lucas at first, but after Lucas' trade to the New Jersey Nets, he became the full-time starter. He played three seasons in Portland, during which he earned a spot in the 1980 NBA All-Star Game, after some of the top players sat out due to injury. During that All-Star weekend, which was held in Landover, Maryland, nearby American U. held a halftime ceremony in which they retired Washington's number. He was named a team captain for the following season. In his post-punch career, numerous players, coaches, and officials noted that he became less aggressive on the court out of fear of getting into another fight; something he never did. Washington started experiencing pain in his back and knees during the 1980–81 season. The pain became unbearable during the 1981–82 season, and he retired in January 1982 after missing all but 20 games. In 1987, after more than five years out of the league, he tried to make a comeback with the Warriors, but lasted only eight games on the roster (playing in six of them) before being cut.\n\nSince retiring, Washington has run restaurants and is a founder and operator of a number of charitable organizations. He ran a restaurant in the Portland metropolitan area with former Blazer teammate Kevin Duckworth, called \"Le Slam.\" The restaurant closed in 2001. He has also served in a coaching role with Stanford University, and worked at Pete Newell's fabled \"Big Man Camp\" for 15 years. In 1995, he founded The 6th Man Foundation, otherwise known as Project Contact Africa. In August 1994, Washington accompanied a team of doctors and nurses on a humanitarian mission to Goma, Zaire, working in a refugee camp helping victims of the bloody Rwandan Civil War. The stench of death and human waste extended for miles. \"It was a sad, sad sight\", Washington later recalled, \"a sight I'll never forget.\"\n\nAfter his career, Washington has complained of treatment he has received in relation to his punching of Tomjanovich. Washington has sought to portray himself as a victim of the fight and appears to have exaggerated some of the misfortunes that came his way as a result of it. Washington told \"The New York Times\" that he has been refused work as a coach time and again. However, Tom Davis hired him as an assistant coach at Stanford, and Davis wanted to bring him to Iowa when he went to coach there. Washington stayed at Stanford and later quit his assistant coaching position, and he subsequently worked as strength and conditioning coach for the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nWashington also claimed that American University cut off contact with him after he punched Tomjanovich. However, this appears to be a misrepresentation of certain events. When he tried to become athletic director of American in 1995, the school offered to hire him as assistant to the athletic director, since Washington had no front office experience. When confronted about this Washington stated: \"I didn't see why I couldn't be the AD so they could use my name out front and then have someone with more experience be my assistant.\" John Feinstein and others have suggested that the most lasting damage caused by the fight between Washington and Tomjanovich has been to Washington's self-image, and his supposed refusal to accept responsibility for his actions in that fight. Pat later said it went deeper than that, as when she met him in college:\nWashington currently lives in the Washington, D.C. area, where he is employed as a regional representative of the National Basketball Players Association.\n\nOn May 25, 2016, Washington was indicted for allegedly embezzling roughly $500,000 meant for children in Africa. On December 4, 2017, he pled guilty to three counts: one of aggravated identity theft, and two of making a false statement in a tax return. Washington used the charity to launder money he received as kickbacks. Washington, as a regional representative for the National Basketball Players Association, referred NBA players to San Diego attorney Ronald Mix, who then made donations to the charity, but were actually illegal referral payments. Washington then withdrew this money for personal spending. Washington failed to report this money as income on his tax return. In July 2018, he was sentenced to six years in federal prison for charity fraud.\n\n\n\n"}

Licklider, which was published during the year 1960.\n\nMan-computer symbiosis is a fundamental or key text of the modern computing revolution.\n\nThe work describes something of Lickliders' vision for a complementary (symbiotic) relationship between humans and computers at a potential time of the future. According to \"Bardini\", Licklider envisioned a future time when machine cognition (\"cerebration\") would surpass and become independent of human direction, as a basic stage of development within human evolution. \"Jacucci\" gives the description of Lickliders' vision as being the \"very tight coupling of human brains and computing machines\" (c.f. \"brain\", the term \"cohesion\" & the general definitions of the term \"coupling\").\n\nAs a necessary \"pre-requisite\" of human-computer symbiosis, Licklider conceived of a thing known as the \"Thinking centre\". Altogether these things were pre-conditions for the development of networks.\n\n\"Streeter\" identifies as the main empirical element of the work as the time and motion analysis, which is shown under Part 3 of the work. In addition he identified two reasons for Licklider to have considered such a concept as a \"symbiotic human computer relationship\" at all as beneficial, to be firstly, for it might bring about an advantage emerging from the use of a computer, such that there are similarities with the necessary methodology of such a use (i.e. \"trial and error\"), to the methodology of problem solving through play, and secondarily, because of the advantage which results from using computers in situations of battle. \"Foster\" states Licklider sought to promote computer use in order to:\n\nAs his personal motivating force, Streeter considers Licklider to be positing an escape from the limitations of the mode of computer use during his time, which was batch processing. Russell thinks Licklider was stimulated by an encounter with the newly developed PDP-1.\n\nThe work shows the following contents:\n\nPart 1 is titled Introduction and has 2 sub-headings, \"Symbiosis\" (part 1.1) and \"Between \"Mechanically Extended Man\" and \"Artificial Intelligence\"\" (part 1.2).\n\nPart 1.1 begins by showing a definition of the term symbiosis using the illustration of the relationship between two organisms, a fig-tree, and its pollinator, a type of fig-wasp. The article continues to sub-classify the concept of a symbiotic relationship between humans and computers within the larger defined thing which is the relationship between men and machines generally (\"man-machine systems\"), and outlines the intentions of its author in the possibility within the future of a relationship for the benefit of human thinking.\n\nPart 1.2 references J. D. North's, \"The rational behavior of mechanically extended man\" to begin a brief discussion on \"mechanically extended man\" and proceeds to include developments and future developments within artificial intelligence.\n\nPart 2 is titled \"Aims of Man-Computer Symbiosis\".\n\nPart 3 is titled \"Need for Computer Participation in Formulative and Real-Time Thinking\" and begins by continuing from a preceding statement on the likelihood of data-processing machines improving human thinking and problem solving. This part proceeds to an outline of an investigation sub-headed \"A Preliminary and Informal Time-and-Motion Analysis of Technical Thinking\", in which Licklider investigated his own activities during the spring and summer of 1957. This discussion includes a statement on the currently understood definition of the term computer, as \"a wide class of calculating, data-processing, and information-storage-and-retrieval machines\" (c.f. Information storage and retrieval).Licklider begins a comparison between the so-called \"genotypic\" similarities between humans and computers, in the seventh passage of this part, with a definition of men as:\n\nand ends with the acknowledgement of differences between inherent processing speed and use of language.\n\nPart 4 is titled \"Separable Functions of Men and Computers in the Anticipated Symbiotic Association\". Licklider in the first passage of this part makes reference to the SAGE System. The text continues to identify ways in which theoretically active computers would function in ways including; to interpolate, extrapolate, convert static equations or logical statements into dynamic models (see also \"conceptual models\").The part concludes with a statement of the functioning of a potential computer as performing diagnosis, pattern-matching, and relevance-recognizing.\n\nPart 5 is the final part of the article and is titled \"Prerequisites for Realization of Man-Computer Symbiosis\". It has five sub-headings, \"Speed Mismatch Between Men and Computers, Memory Hardware Requirements, Memory Organization Requirements, The Language Problem\", and \"Input and Output Equipment.\"\n\nPart 5.3. mentions the concept of trie memory (\"E. Fredkin, \"Trie memory,\" Communications of the ACM, Sept. 1960\").\n\nPart 5.4. begins initially by demonstrating the differences between human language and computer language, the latter in regards especially to FORTRAN, an \"Information Processing Language\" identified by J. C. Shaw, A. Newell, H. A. Simon, and T. O. Ellis (in \"A command structure for complex information processing, Proc. WJCC, pp. 119-128; May, 1958\"), ALGOL (\"and related systems\"), and continues from the second passage from the statement:\n\nparticularly recognising the existence of human goals (see also \"Goal orientation\").\n\nThe work references 26 studies, of which fourteen are concerning acoustic studies and related areas of investigation, and fifteen on computing and studies related to this, including four related to studies on the subject of chess.\n\n\"See also: IEEE, Cybernetics & Human–machine system\"\n\nInstitute of Radio Engineers (IRE) Transactions ceased publishing during 1962, and is now publishing instead as \"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics\", and \"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems\".\n\nDuring August 1962, Licklider and Welden Clark joint published \"On-Line Man-Computer Communication\". \n\nMIT published a paper during 1966, written by Warren Teitelman, entitled \"Pilot: A Step Towards Man-Computer Symbiosis\". \n\nAt the time of the publication of one paper, during 2004, there were very few computer applications known to the authors, which exhibited the qualities of computers identified by Licklider within his 1960 article, of being human-like with respect to being collaboratory and possessing the ability to communicate in human like ways. As part of their paper, the authors (N Lesh \"et al\") mention a discussion of prototypes under development by the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14511141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14511141", "title": "Mastotermes darwiniensis", "text": "Mastotermes darwiniensis\n\nMastotermes darwiniensis, common names giant northern termite and Darwin termite, is a termite species found only in northern Australia. It is the most primitive termite alive.\n\nThis species shows uncanny similarities to certain cockroaches, the termites' closest relatives. These similarities include the anal lobe of the wing and the laying of eggs in bunches, rather than singly. It is the only living member of its genus \"Mastotermes\" and its family Mastotermitidae, though numerous fossil taxa are known. The termites were traditionally placed in the Exopterygota, but such an indiscriminate treatment makes that group a paraphyletic grade of basal neopterans. Thus, the cockroaches, termites, and their relatives are nowadays placed in a clade called the Dictyoptera. These singular termites appear at first glance like a cockroach's abdomen stuck to a termite's fore part. Their wings have the same form as those of the roaches, and its eggs are laid in a case as are roach eggs. It is thought to have evolved from the same ancestors as the wood roaches (\"Cryptocercus\") in the Permian. Fossil wings have been discovered in the Permian of Kansas which have a close resemblance to wings of \"Mastotermes\" of the Mastotermitidae, which is the most primitive living termite. This fossil is called \"Pycnoblattina\". It folded its wings in a convex pattern between segments 1a and 2a. \"Mastotermes\" is the only living insect that does the same.\n\nUnlike cockroaches, only the reproductives have wings (see Life cycle of termites); wings that are considerably longer than their abdomen. Alates are approximately 35 mm long with a 50 mm wingspan. Soldiers are 11–13 mm long and workers are 10–11.5 mm long.\n\n\"Mastotermes darwiniensis\" is usually not very numerous, nor are the colonies large when left to natural conditions. However, when given abundant water (such as regular irrigation) and favourable food and soil conditions (such as stored timber or timber structures), populations can be enormous, numbering in the millions, quickly destroying their host. Its diet is varied, as it will eat introduced plants, damaged ivory and leather, and wood and debris, and in fact almost anything organic. It becomes a major agricultural pest, to the extent that vegetable farming has been virtually abandoned in Northern Australia wherever this termite is numerous, which it is outside of the rain forest or bauxite soils. It has developed the ability to bore up into a living tree and ring bark it such that it dies and becomes the center of a colony.\n\n\"M. darwiniensis\" is the only known host of the symbiotic protozoan \"Mixotricha paradoxa\", remarkable for its multiple bacterial symbionts.\n\n"}

{"id": "33822994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33822994", "title": "Monstrous birth", "text": "Monstrous birth\n\nA monstrous birth, variously defined in history, is a birth in which a defect of some sort renders the animal or human child monstrous. Such births were often taken as omens, signs of God, or moral warnings, but besides these supernatural or religious explanations, medical explanations were also given, in which often the mother's state of mind or her sexual behavior was responsible for the deformed fetus. In early and medieval Christianity, monstrous births posed difficult theological problems about humanity and salvation; in the early modern period the interest shifted toward scientific inquiry.\n\nAn early reference to monstrous birth is found in the apocalyptic biblical text 2 Esdras, where it is linked to menstruation: \"women in their uncleanness will bear monsters.\" Monstrous births are often placed in a religious context and interpreted as signs and symbols, as is evidenced in the 1493 \"Nuremberg Chronicle\". According to David Hume's \"The Natural History of Religion\", they are among the first signs that arouse the barbarian's interest. Monstrous human births raise the question of the difference between humans and animals, and anthropologists have described different interpretations of and behaviors toward such births. Among the East African Nuer people, monstrous births are acted on in a way that restores the division between the categories of human and animal: \"the Nuer treat monstrous births as baby hippopotamuses, accidentally born to humans, and, with this labelling, the appropriate action is clear. They gently lay them in the river where they belong.\"\n\nWhether monstrous births were natural, unnatural, or supernatural remained a topic of discussion. Saint Augustine held that nothing \"done by the will of God could be contrary to nature,\" whereas Thomas Aquinas considered some miracles to be against nature.\n\nReasons for monstrous births given in early medieval penitentials (concerned with sexual sin) and thirteenth-century medical texts (concerned with physical purity) include pollution through menses and intercourse during menstruation. Such explanations are found in many medieval literary texts, including Jean Maillart's fourteenth-century \"Roman du Comte Anjou\" and Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Man of Law's Tale.\"\n\nSixteenth- and seventeenth-century medical texts, which treat pregnancy as a disease, suggest that monstrous births may be the result of the mother's sickness or distress, and they continue the myth of (bestial) intercourse during pregnancy as a cause. The mother's role is of the greatest importance, and what was presupposed was the possibility of an emotional transference from mother to fetus, referred to as the \"theory of the maternal imagination\":According to most of the authors of the sixteenth through early eighteenth centuries, an expectant mother's cravings, desires, and experiences--especially experiences that aroused strong passions such as fear and lust--were capable of \"directly\" inscribing themselves upon the body of the fetus, producing deformities and monstrosities that retained the semantic content of the original impression.\n\nAt the same time, an epistemological shift was taking place, and monstrous births changed from \"signs to facts.\" Such births were now often publicized in pamphlets and broadsides and became the subject of scientific investigation; the early sixteenth century produced an \"apparent upsurge of interest in monstrous births.\"\n\nMonstrous animal births often figure in times of religious upheaval. Many occurred in the Europe of the Reformation: the advent of Luther was supposedly announced by the 1522 birth of a monstrous calf (a mooncalf) in Saxony, and the accession of Elizabeth I of England was supposedly indicated by monstrous births as well, as a warning to \"Catholics and other sinners.\"\n\nA misshapen calf, born in Freiberg, Saxony, on 8 December 1522, quickly became important in the German Reformation. It was born with oddly shaped legs (its hind legs straight as a human's) and with a fold of skin over its head shaped like a cowl—hence its comparison to a monk. An illustration made its way to a Prague astrologer, who \"discovered that the monster did indeed signify something terrible, indeed the most awful thing possible--Martin Luther.\" Luther himself responded quickly with a pamphlet containing a mock exegesis of the creature, \"Monk Calf\", in which the \"Monk Calf\" stands, in all its monstrosity, for the Catholic church. Luther's anti-papist pamphlet appeared together with a tract by Philipp Melanchthon which discussed a fictional monster, the Pope-Ass, a hybrid between a man and a donkey supposedly found near Rome after the 1496 flood. Circulated in 1523, Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon's pamphlet was titled \"The Meaning of Two Horrific Figures, the Papal Ass at Rome and the Monk Calf Found at Freyberg in Meissen\". Luca Cranach the Elder and his workshop provided the illustrations of the Papal Ass and the Monk Calf for the pamphlet. Variations of Luther and Melanchthon’s pamphlet eventually were circulated, including one that depicted the Papal Ass and the Monk Calf in “an encounter between the two creatures. This opening page adds a new phrase to the title of the book: ‘with signs of the Day of Judgement.'\"\n\nEspecially monstrous births among humans were, from the early Middle Ages on, seen as signifying God's interaction with the world: \"a monstrous birth \"is\" the shape of wickedness, not only the result of original sin but of more local and immediate forms as well.\" One of the best known examples of such births was the Monster of Ravenna.\n\nAlthough the connections between a monstrous birth and improper maternal behavior were eventually dismissed by reliable authorities, a particularly late incident involving such allegations took place in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Mary Dyer, later to become a Quaker martyr, gave birth to a deformed child in October 1637. Noted religious dissenter Anne Hutchinson, who was acquainted with the Dyer family and was present at that birth, was herself delivered of a \"monster\" in the next year. Both cases were publicized by John Winthrop, who was at the time bringing legal proceedings against both women for heresy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30544310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30544310", "title": "Murder of Anni Dewani", "text": "Murder of Anni Dewani\n\nAnni Ninna Dewani (\"née\" Hindocha; 12 March 1982 – 13 November 2010) was a Swedish woman of Indian origin who was murdered while on her honeymoon in South Africa after the taxi in which she and her husband were travelling was hijacked.\n\nArrests were made in the days following the crime; hijackers Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni, and hotel receptionist Monde Mbolombo admitted to their involvement in an unintentionally fatal robbery and kidnapping. Facing life in prison, Qwabe and Mbolombo later changed their stories to allege the crime had been a premeditated murder for hire at the behest of Anni's husband Shrien Dewani. Taxi driver Zola Tongo initially claimed to be an innocent victim of the incident but, faced with the weight of evidence implicating him in the crime and in the wake of his fellow conspirators' allegations of a \"murder for hire\" plot, he too changed his story to allege the husband was the instigator. Attractive plea bargains were offered to the conspirators in exchange for future testimony in legal proceedings related to the crime. The allegation of the husband's involvement made global headlines; Shrien Dewani's supporters emphatically denied the accusations, saying it was \"ludicrous\" to suggest he had solicited an attack on his wife from the first taxi driver he met within hours of their arrival in Cape Town. However, there has also been serious questions asked about Dewanis innocence. For example, why he would take his wife to a dangerous neighbourhood so late at night to 'sightsee' Then the secret meeting between Dewani & Tongo the day after the murder which was caught on hotel surveillance. to 18 years in prison. Mziwamadoda Qwabe pleaded guilty to murder in August 2012 and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Xolile Mngeni was tried and convicted of murder in November 2012 and was sentenced to life in prison. Monde Mbolombo admitted his involvement but was offered immunity in exchange for testimony against the other men alleged to have been involved in the crime.\n\nSouth African prosecutors formulated charges against Shrien Dewani based on the later-discredited confessions of Tongo, Qwabe and Mbolombo, who were found to have committed perjury. Charges were brought on the basis Anni had been the victim of a premeditated kidnapping and murder for hire that was staged to appear as a random carjacking at the alleged behest of her husband. Following a long legal battle, Shrien was extradited from the UK to South Africa to face trial. He was exonerated by a Western Cape High Court, which in December 2014 ruled there was no credible evidence to support the allegations against him nor to support the allegation the crime was a premeditated murder for hire.\n\nThe Hindocha family was forced to leave Uganda in the early 1970s after the country's president Idi Amin expelled all Asians living there. They were granted residence in Sweden and settled in Mariestad, where their daughter Anni was born and raised. \n\nAnni Hindocha met Shrien Dewani in London in 2009; they maintained a long-distance relationship until Hindocha moved to the UK in March 2010, where they became engaged in May that year. The couple, whose relationship was sometimes troubled, married at Lake Powai near Mumbai, India, on 29 October 2010. They were planning to hold a civil ceremony in the UK in 2011 for friends who could not attend their wedding in India.\n\nAfter landing at Cape Town International Airport on 7 November 2010, Dewani and her husband took a domestic flight and stayed at Kruger National Park for four nights. On 12 November, the couple returned to Cape Town International Airport, where they met and engaged taxi driver Zola Tongo to drive them to the five-star Cape Grace Hotel.\n\nOn 13 November, having retained Tongo as a tour guide, the couple were driven through the city in his VW Sharan into Gugulethu. Tongo drove past a BBQ restaurant (Mzolis) and they continued to Surfside Restaurant in Strand, where the couple dined. After their meal, Tongo drove the Dewanis back into Gugulethu. Shortly after turning off the main road, two armed men hijacked the vehicle. After driving a short distance, Tongo was ejected from the taxi. Shrien Dewani was robbed of his money, wallet, designer watch and mobile telephone, and after being driven for about 20 minutes, he was also ejected from the vehicle. On the street, a bystander assisted him by calling the police.\n\nAt 07:50 on 14 November, in Lingelethu West, Anni Dewani was found dead in the back of the VW Sharan taxi. She had suffered a single gunshot wound to her neck. Police later confirmed Anni's Giorgio Armani wristwatch, a white-gold and diamond bracelet, her handbag and her BlackBerry mobile telephone were missing, and assumed they were stolen. The items stolen in the robbery had an estimated value of R90,000.\n\nAnni Dewani's body was taken to a Cape Town hospital. The post-mortem examination revealed bruising on her inner leg, indicating she had been involved in a struggle. It also indicated she had died from a single gunshot that passed through her hand and neck, severing an artery. There was no sign of sexual assault. On 17 November, Dewani's body was released by the South African authorities and returned to the United Kingdom on a British Airways flight, accompanied by her husband. Six months after her death, in a Hindu ceremony, her family scattered her ashes in her favourite area of the Vänern lake, close to her home town, Mariestad, Sweden.\n\nAs a result of a palm print found on the abandoned taxi, Xolile Mngeni was arrested on Tuesday 16 November 2010. Mngeni made a videotaped confession in the presence of Captain Jonker of the South African Police Service, admitting involvement in a hijack, armed robbery and kidnapping operation. He described Shrien and Anni Dewani as victims and said Qwabe shot Anni Dewani during a struggle for her handbag.\n\nMziwamadoda Qwabe was arrested at around 01:00 on Thursday 18 November 2010 as a result of a tip-off from a trusted township informant. After initial denials, Qwabe was allowed to consult with arrested co-conspirators Mbolombo and Mngeni, and subsequently admitted involvement in the hijack, armed robbery and kidnapping. He described Shrien and Anni Dewani as victims. He changed his story during an interview recorded at 17:21 that day, saying the incident was a murder planned at the behest of Shrien Dewani.\n\nMonde Mbolombo was arrested in the early hours of Thursday 18 November 2010 as a result of Qwabe providing his name to the police. After initially denying involvement, Mbolombo made a recorded confession at 16:30, admitting arranging a hijacking and armed robbery operation. The confession did not mention a planned murder or Shrien Dewani's involvement. The following day, Mbolombo changed his story, saying the operation was a planned murder at the behest of Shrien Dewani.\n\nTaxi driver Zola Tongo reported the hijacking to a police station in Gugulethu after he was ejected from the vehicle, and made a statement saying he was an unknowing victim. On 17 November, Tongo gave a statement to Officer Hendrikse of the SAPS, again saying he was an innocent victim. The following day, Tongo appointed attorney William De Grass, and on Saturday 20 November he surrendered to police and said the operation was a planned murder that was staged to appear as a random hijacking at the behest of Shrien Dewani.\n\nIn South Africa, there was much media coverage of the case following the discovery of the body. With an economy reliant on tourism, tour operators reported an immediate drop in bookings as potential visitors became aware of the country's murder rate; on average, 46 per day. There were also concerns the killing would negate the goodwill resulting from the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The assignment of the Police Hawks team, and the early arrests, conviction and statement implicating Shrien Dewani led to increased media coverage.\n\nAn episode of the BBC television documentary series \"Panorama\" in March 2012 reported that the original South African post-mortem report showed the bullet that killed Anni Dewani had passed through her left hand followed by her chest, and that the wound on her neck was an exit wound. The report said the bullet left \"an irregular gunshot exit wound\", which suggested there had been a struggle. A second \"Panorama\" programme broadcast in September 2013 revisited the case and highlighted numerous inconsistencies between the physical evidence, witness testimony, and the South African prosecutors' purported version of events. In particular it said the forensic evidence had not been collected properly and that it indicated an accidental shooting during a struggle rather than a deliberate killing. In addition, while Tongo's alleged share of the fee for the killing was between a half and a third of his usual monthly salary, the two gunmen made substantially more money from the theft of the Dewanis' belongings than the value of the alleged contract. The programme also showed CCTV evidence that supported the idea a surprise helicopter flight for Anni was being arranged between the taxi driver and the intermediary on behalf of Shrien; this being the reason for the money he changed on the morning of the murder.\n\nMziwamadoda Qwabe and Zola Tongo were offered reduced sentences in exchange for guilty pleas and the promise of truthful testimony against Shrien Dewani and in other criminal proceedings related to the crime. These plea deals were granted in accordance with Section 105A of the Criminal Procedure Act. Monde Mbolombo was granted full immunity from prosecution in exchange for his promise of truthful testimony against Shrien Dewani and in other criminal proceedings related to the crime. This plea deal was granted in accordance with Section 204 of the Criminal Procedure Act.\n\nOn 7 December 2010, Zola Tongo appeared in the Western Cape High Court; in accordance with his plea deal under Section 105A of the Criminal Procedure Act, he pleaded guilty to the armed robbery, kidnapping and murder of Anni Dewani—crimes he alleged were committed at the behest of Shrien Dewani. According to the terms of his Section 105A agreement, Tongo was sentenced to 18 years in prison, contingent on him testifying truthfully against Dewani in any future legal proceedings.\n\nTongo was expected to give evidence in the trials of Mngeni and Qwabe in 2011 and 2012. Qwabe avoided trial by pleading guilty pursuant to a Section 105A plea deal. Tongo was not called as a witness at Mngeni’s trial in 2012.\n\n, Tongo was serving his 18-year sentence in Malmesbury Prison, and will be eligible for release in 2019.\n\nIn pre-trial hearings on 18 February at Wynberg Magistrates Court, counsel for Mziwamadoda Qwabe said the court was unable to provide a fair trial for his client. Thabo Nogemane said, \"I am instructed that some unknown police officer assaulted him by means of a big torch. He was hit all over his body. He said the statement was a suggestion put to him by the police. They already had the allegations so they told him: 'Just sign here'. I wouldn't refer to it as a confession, just a statement.\" According to the terms of his Section 105A agreement, Qwabe was sentenced to 25 years in prison, contingent on him testifying truthfully in future legal proceedings relating to the case. Qwabe will be eligible for release in 2027.\n\nIn 2011, Mngeni's lawyer Vusi Tshabalala said his client had been suffocated with a plastic bag before signing a statement admitting his involvement in the killing, further saying police resorted to \"irregular methods\" because of the pressure they were under to solve the high-profile case. The start of Mngeni's trial was delayed, and on 13 June 2011 it was announced he had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumour.\n\nDespite having admitted to his role in the robbery and kidnapping of Anni Dewani in a videotaped confession, Mngeni pleaded not guilty at the start of his 2012 trial, saying he had an alibi and was not at the scene of the crime. Mngeni’s lawyers said his initial confession should be ruled inadmissible as evidence because it was allegedly extracted using torture. Justice Robert Henney ruled against Mngeni and said the confession was admissible. Before testifying in the Mngeni trial, key witness Monde Mbolombo read out a prepared statement confessing to lying in his two previous affidavits and promised to tell the truth when testifying.\n\nOn 19 November 2012, Mngeni was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in jail. The court accepted Mziwamadoda Qwabe's and Monde Mbolombo's version of events, according to which the crime was a contract killing. Mngeni was ruled to have been the person who shot Anni Dewani. The court's findings were superseded by the judgement in the later trial of Shrien Dewani, in which the court found the earlier determinations had been made on the basis of flawed forensic evidence, and perjury of Qwabe and Mbolombo, the two key witnesses.\n\nIn July 2014, it was confirmed that a medical parole application had been made for Mngeni, who was terminally ill with a brain tumour. He was denied parole and died in jail at the Goodwood Centre of Excellence on 18 October 2014.\n\nAfter a long legal battle, Shrien Dewani was extradited from the United Kingdom to South Africa on 7 April 2014. Upon arrival he was arrested, charged and ordered to stand trial for allegedly arranging the murder of his wife. He was charged with five offences; conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, murder, kidnapping and obstructing the administration of justice. He pleaded not guilty to all five charges.\n\nDewani's trial began on 6 October 2014. Under cross examination, the key witnesses who alleged Dewani's involvement—Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Monde Mbolombo—contradicted their previous statements and each other on most of the key elements of the \"murder for hire\" story. Tongo and Mbolombo were found to have fabricated telephone calls and text messages that did not exist and refused to identify a fifth conspirator referred to in taped recordings. Qwabe refused to explain to the court why Anni was driven into a residential area.\n\nOn 24 November 2014, after the close of the prosecution's case, Dewani's counsel argued for the case to be dismissed under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Act, citing a lack of credible evidence linking his client to the crime. On 8 December, the application for dismissal under Section 174 was granted by the Honourable Judge Traverso; Dewani was acquitted and exonerated of all involvement with the crimes. In her judgement, Traverso ruled there was no credible evidence linking Shrien Dewani to the crime and explained her ruling by saying:\n\nThe court overturned the finding of Justice Henney in the Mngeni trial, ruling that Xolile Mngeni could not have been the person who shot Anni, and that some of the key conclusions reached in the 2012 Mngeni trial were erroneous, being based on flawed forensic evidence and the admitted lies of Monde Mbolombo. The court also ruled that Monde Mbolombo had again committed perjury and would not be granted indemnity from prosecution. Judge Traverso said, \"Before Mr. Mbolombo proceeded with his evidence, he delivered a pre-prepared speech which, from the record, appears to be virtually identical to a similarly emotive speech which he gave the court in the Mngeni trial, before blatantly lying about material aspects.\"\n\nMonde Mbolombo has not been prosecuted or punished for his self-confessed role in the crime, nor for his self-confessed perjury whilst testifying. On 19 November 2015 the Director of Public Prosecutions decided Mbolombo could not be prosecuted.\n\nOn 22 January 2015, a complaint was lodged by the Higher Education Transformation Network (HETN), alleging judicial bias and prejudiced behaviour of Judge Traverso in the trial of Shrien Dewani. On 25 April that year, a Judicial Conduct Committee dismissed the HETN's complaint, describing it as \"frivolous\" and lacking in substance.

It was the last book he finished in his lifetime, running to some 90 pages of a single long essay. It is commonly referred to as his \"Freiheitsschrift\" (freedom text) or \"freedom essay\".\n\nDescribed by Hans Urs von Balthasar as \"the most titanic work of German idealism\", it is also seen as anticipating much of the collection of basic existentialist motifs. Its ambitions were high: to tackle the problem of radical evil, and to innovate at a metaphysical level, in particular to correct dualism. As its title suggests, it intends to give an account of human freedom, and the requirements on the philosophical side to protect this idea from particular formulations, at issue during the period, of determinism.\n\nThe literature on the history of philosophy contains many assertions about the general influences on Schelling. There are also more specific comments about other thinkers and traditions that had a definite effect on this transitional work. The opening pages make it clear that Schelling is engaged in arguing against Spinozism, a position which (often simply called \"dogmatism\") had been a target for both philosophical and religious thinkers in Germany for decades. Schelling was not concerned about rejecting all that Baruch Spinoza's thought implied, in the terms of that debate, but to salvage something from the unification of view (monism) that came with it, while allowing room for freedom.\n\nAt this time Schelling was influenced also by Franz Xaver von Baader and the writings of Jakob Böhme. In fact \"Of Human Freedom\" contains explicit references to Baader's doctrine of evil, and Böhme's schematic creation myths, and uses the term theosophy; a detailed mapping of Böhme's thought onto Schelling's argument in the \"Freiheitsschrift\" has been carried out by Paola Mayer. On the other hand Robert Schneider and Ernst Benz have argued for the more direct influence of the pietist Johann Albrecht Bengel and theosophist Friedrich Christoph Oetinger.\n\nExplicit concerns of Schelling in the book are: the existence of evil and the emergence into reason. Schelling offers a solution to the first, an old theological chestnut, in brief that “evil makes arbitrary choice possible”. On the other hand, by no means all interpretations of the work come from the direction of theology and the problem of evil. The second idea, requiring a rationale of emergence, was more innovative, because of the place it gave to irrationalism and anthropomorphism, within the \"cosmic\" setting (which need not be taken literally). The work stands also in relation to a decade of previous publications, formulations, and rivalries.\n\nA view from the nineteenth century is that of Harald Høffding (who sets the book in the context of a supposed personal crisis and philosophical block):\n\nModern readings of Schelling's intentions can differ quite widely from this interpretation (and each other). This writing of Schelling is also seen as the beginning of his critique of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and an announcement of a transitional moment in philosophy; part of the purpose was self-justification, verging on polemic in defence of Schelling's panentheism. It is therefore a signpost marking a fork in the road for what is now called \"classical German philosophy\": even if it had its time of dominance, absolute idealism in Hegel's sense is (after the \"freedom essay\") just one branch of the discussion of the Absolute in German idealism. Hegel became a system-builder while Schelling produced no systematic or finished philosophy in three decades after the \"Freiheitsschrift\".\n\nThe conception of evil is set against both the Neoplatonic \"privatio boni\" and the Manichaean division into two disconnected and contending powers. Evil must be seen as active, in both God and natural creatures. There is a distinction: in God evil can never stray out of its place (at the base), while in man it certainly may exceed its role of basing self-hood.\n\nSlavoj Žižek writes that the central tenet is that\n\nJohn W. Cooper writes\n\nAt the time of writing the \"Freiheitschrift\", Schelling had on his mind an accusation of pantheism, levelled at him by Friedrich Schlegel in \"Über Sprache und Weisheit der Indier\" (1808). The German Pantheism controversy of the 1780s continued to cast a long shadow. F. H. Jacobi, who had launched it, was someone with whom Schelling was in contact in Munich, where the book was written.\n\nIn his book, Schelling takes up the issue of pantheism, concerned to refute the idea that it necessarily leads to fatalism, so negating human freedom. Here he is closer to Spinoza, erasing the distinction between nature and God. On the other hand, Schelling is trying to overcome the distinction made in Spinoza's system, between \"natura naturans\" (dynamic) and \"natura naturata\" (passive). Schelling wanted to locate the fatalism in Spinoza, not in the pantheism or monism, but in his formulation.\n\nAccording to Andrew Bowie:\n\nSchelling considered that the idealist conception of freedom, in Immanuel Kant and Johann Gottlieb Fichte, had remained undeveloped, absent a cleaner break with the rationalist systems of Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz, and a distinctive theory of its human element. In another view of the book's main theme, leading onto the further development of the philosophy of the \"Weltalter\" (Ages of the World), Schelling\n\nIn this approach, the Absolute takes on a darker side, and shows therefore the connection to the theme of the problem of evil. This aspect then pervades all life:\n\nThis is an approximate summary of the content of the \"Freiheitsschrift\" using page numbering as appears in Schelling's \"Works\". There is no division except into paragraphs.\n\n\nSchelling placed the \"Freiheitsschrift\" at the end of the first volume of his \"Sämmtliche Werke\" (Collected Works). The correct periodisation of his philosophy is still a contentious area, and there are differing views of what kind of punctuation mark it really represents in Schelling's work. It is admittedly important that the book itself begins with an outright rejection of “system”. The publication of this book is said, on the one hand, to mark the beginning of Schelling's “middle period”. As such it marks the break with the “identity philosophy” on which he worked in the first decade of the nineteenth century, after his beginnings as a follower of Johann Fichte and developer of \"Naturphilosophie\".\n\nThe divergence of Schelling and Hegel becomes clear from around this year, with Hegel's ambitions being systematic and explicitly encyclopedic, notions of freedom being quite different, and the use of dialectic becoming obviously distinct on the two sides. Hegel's star was in the ascendent, while Schelling's other road led into the wilderness, at least as far as academic respectability was concerned. Academic recognition for Schelling's work as important to philosophy, as opposed to an idiosyncratic contribution to philosophy of religion, was indeed slow to come. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, one of Schelling's contemporaries and followers, rated it highly.\n\nIn 1936, Martin Heidegger gave a series of lectures on Schelling's freedom essay. These were published in German in 1971 and translated into English in 1984. Heidegger largely treated the \"Freiheitschrift\" as continuous with the \"identity philosophy\" period leading up to it. Heidegger by 1941 had hardened his line to the position that Schelling is still a theorist of an enclosing subjectivity, while treating the \"Freiheitsschrift\" as the apex (\"Gipfel\") of the metaphysics of German idealism. This view is still contested: other authors read the book as the start of something new in philosophy. Schelling's \"Stuttgart Vorlesungen\" of 1810 reformulate and build on the freedom essay, and the \"Weltalter\" manuscripts go further in trying to work out details of the Behmenist insights. The debate is therefore really whether the \"Freiheitschrift\" is culminating, seminal, or possibly both.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11383517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11383517", "title": "Pleistocene rewilding", "text": "Pleistocene rewilding\n\nPleistocene rewilding is the advocacy of the reintroduction of descendants of Pleistocene megafauna, or their close ecological equivalents. An extension of the conservation practice of rewilding, which involves reintroducing species to areas where they became extinct in recent history (hundreds of years ago or less).\n\nTowards the end of the Pleistocene era (roughly 13,000 to 10,000 years ago), nearly all megafauna of Eurasia, Australia, and South/North America, dwindled towards extinction, in what has been referred to as the Quaternary extinction event. With the loss of large herbivores and predator species, niches important for ecosystem functioning were left unoccupied. In the words of the biologist Tim Flannery, \"ever since the extinction of the megafauna 13,000 years ago, the continent has had a seriously unbalanced fauna\". This means, for example, that the managers of national parks in North America have to resort to culling to keep the population of ungulates under control.\n\nPaul S. Martin (originator of the Pleistocene overkill hypothesis) states that present ecological communities in North America do not function appropriately in the absence of megafauna, because much of the native flora and fauna evolved under the influence of large mammals.\n\nResearch shows that species interactions play a pivotal role in conservation efforts. Communities where species evolved in response to Pleistocene megafauna (but now lack large mammals) may be in danger of collapse. Most living megafauna are threatened or endangered; extant megafauna have a significant impact on the communities they occupy, which supports the idea that communities evolved in response to large mammals. Pleistocene rewilding could \"serve as additional refugia to help preserve that evolutionary potential\" of megafauna. Reintroducing megafauna to North America could preserve current megafauna, while filling ecological niches that have been vacant since the Pleistocene.\n\nPleistocene rewilding aims at the promotion of extant fauna and the reintroduction of extinct genera in the southwestern and central United States. Native fauna are the first genera proposed for reintroduction. The Bolson tortoise was widespread during the Pleistocene era, and continued to be common during the Holocene epoch until recent times. Its reintroduction from northern Mexico would be a necessary step to recreate the soil humidity present in the Pleistocene, which would support grassland and extant shrub-land and provide the habitat required for the herbivores set for reintroduction. Other large tortoise species might later be introduced to fill the roll of various species of Hesperotestudo. However, to be successful, ecologists must first support fauna already present in the region.\n\nThe pronghorn, which is extant in most of the west after almost becoming extinct, is crucial to the revival of the ancient ecosystem. Pronghorns are native to the region, which once supported large numbers of the species and extinct relatives of the same family. It would occupy the great plains and other arid regions of the west and southwest.\n\nThe plains bison numbered in the millions during the Pleistocene and most of the Holocene, until European settlers drove them to near-extinction in the late 19th century. The bison has made a recovery in many regions of its former range, and is involved in several local rewilding projects across the Midwestern United States.\n\nBighorn sheep and mountain goats are already present in the surrounding mountainous areas and therefore should not pose a problem in rewilding more mountainous areas. Mountain goats are already being introduced to areas formerly occupied by Oreamnos haringtoni, a more southern relative that went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. Reintroducing extant species of deer to the more forested areas of the region would be beneficial for the ecosystems they occupy, providing rich nutrients for the forested regions and helping to maintain them. These species include elk, white-tailed and mule deer.\n\nHerbivorous species considered beneficial for the regional ecosystems include the collared peccary, a species of New World wild pig that was abundant in the Pleistocene. Although this species (along with the flat-headed and long-nosed peccaries) are extinct in many regions of North America, their relatives survive in Central and South America and the collared peccary can still be found in southern Arizona and Texas. The Chacoan peccary, which is morphologically very similar to the flat-headed peccary, might be able to replace it in areas of the Great Plains and the South.\n\nHorses originated in North America and spread to Asia via the Ice Age land bridge, but became extinct in their evolutionary homeland alongside the mammoth and ground sloth. The Pleistocene grasslands of North America were the birthplace of the modern horse, and by extension the wild horse. Przewalski's horses are well adapted to arid and grassland regions and could be introduced as a substitute for their close North American relative, Scott's horse. The stilt-legged horses might be approximated by the morphologically similar onagers, kiangs, and asses. Animals that would serve as predators of these equine species would include lions and wolves.\n\nAlongside the wild horse, camels evolved in the drier regions of North America. Although camelids are extinct in North America, they have survived in South America until today: the guanaco and vicuña, and the domesticated llama and alpaca. North America links the South American camelids with those of the Old World (the dromedary, Bactrian camel and wild Bactrian camel). Pleistocene rewilding suggests that the closest relatives of the North American species of camelid be reintroduced. The best candidates would be the wild Bactrian as a proxy for Camelops, the guanaco as a proxy for Hemiauchenia, and possibly the Vicuña as a proxy for Palaeolama. These species would live in the arid regions and grasslands of North America. Free-ranging camels face predators typical of their regional distribution, which include wolves and lions. The main predator of guanacos and vicuñas is the cougar.\nDuring the Pleistocene, a species of tapir existed in North America with many regional variants. They became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene era, but their relatives survive in Asia and South America. The mountain tapir would be an excellent choice for rewilding humid areas, such as those near lakes and rivers. The mountain tapir is the only extant non-tropical species of tapir. Predators of mountain tapirs include cougars, bears, and, less commonly, jaguars. Good introduction areas might include forested ecosystems of the west and east coasts, and the more scrub-like or wetland ecosystem of the south.\n\nDuring the Pleistocene, large populations of Proboscideans lived in North America, such as the Columbian mammoth and the American mastodon. The mastodons all became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene era, as did the mammoths of North America. However, an extant relative of the mammoth is the Asian elephant. It now resides only in tropical southeastern Asia, but the fossil record shows that it was much more widespread, living in temperate northern China as well as the Middle East (an area bearing an ecological similarity to the southern and central United States). The Asian elephant is possibly a good candidate for Pleistocene rewilding in North America. Asian elephants would do well in the environments previously occupied by the Columbian mammoth. African elephants have also been suggested for introduction into North America.\n\nPleistocene America boasted a wide variety of dangerous carnivores (most of which are extinct today), such as the short-faced bear, saber-toothed cats (e.g. Homotherium), the American lion, dire wolf, and the American cheetah. Some carnivores and omnivores survived the end of the Pleistocene era and were widespread in North America until Europeans arrived, such as grizzly bears, cougars, jaguars, grey and red wolves, bobcats, and coyotes. The cheetah could serve as a substitute for \"Miracinonyx\", keeping the population of pronghorns in check. Jaguars could be reintroduced back to areas of North America to control populations of prey animals. Some of the larger cats such as the African lion could act as a proxy for the Pleistocene American lion, they could be introduced to keep the numbers of American bison, equids, and camelids in check.\n\nThe main criticism of the Pleistocene rewilding is that it is unrealistic to assume that communities today are functionally similar to their state 10,000 years ago. Opponents argue that there has been more than enough time for communities to evolve in the absence of mega-fauna, and thus the reintroduction of large mammals could thwart ecosystem dynamics and possibly cause collapse. Under this argument, the prospective taxa for reintroduction are considered exotic and could potentially harm natives of North America through invasion, disease, or other factors.\n\nOpponents of the Pleistocene rewilding present an alternative conservation program, in which more recent North American natives will be reintroduced into parts of their native ranges where they became extinct during historical times. Another way of rewilding Americas, Asia, etc. is by using de-extinction, bringing extinct species back to life through cloning.\n\nThis plan was considered by Josh Donlan and Jens-C. Svenning, and involves (as in rewilding North America) creating a Pleistocene habitat in portions of Europe.[12] Svenning claims that \"Pleistocene Rewilding can be taken for consideration outside of North America\". Incidentally, an independent \"Rewilding Europe\" initiative was established in the Netherlands in 2011, with the western Iberian Peninsula, Velebit, the Danube delta and the eastern and southern Carpathians as particular targets.[13]\n\nThe proxies which may be used for this project(s) are:\n\n\n\nThe aim of Siberian Pleistocene rewilding is to recreate the ancient mammoth steppe by reintroducing megafauna. The first step was the successful reintroduction of musk oxen on the Taymyr Peninsula and Wrangel island. In 1988, researcher Sergey Zimov created Pleistocene Park – a nature reserve in northeastern Siberia for full-scale megafauna rewilding. Reindeer, Siberian roe deer and moose were already present; Yakutian horses, muskox, Altai wapiti and wisent were reintroduced. Reintroduction is also planned for yak, Bactrian camels, snow sheep, Saiga antelope, and Siberian tigers.\n\nThe wood bison, the closest relative of the ancient bison which became extinct in Siberia 1,000 to 2,000 years ago, is an important species for the ecology of Siberia. In 2006, 30 bison calves were flown from Edmonton, Alberta to Yakutsk. Now they live in the government-run Ust'-Buotama reserve.\n\n\n\nMegafauna that arose on insular landmasses were especially vulnerable to human influence because they evolved in isolation from other landmasses, and thus were not subjected to the same selection pressures that surviving fauna were subject to, and many forms of insular megafauna were wiped out after the arrival of humans. Therefore, scientists have suggested introducing closely related taxa to replace the extinct taxa. This is being done on several islands, with replacing closely related or ecologically functional giant tortoises to replace extinct giant tortoises. For example, the Aldabra giant tortoise has been suggested for replacing the extinct Malagasy giant tortoises, and Malagasy radiated tortoises have been introduced to Maritius to replace the tortoises that were present there. However, the usage of tortoises in rewilding experiments have not been limited to replacing extinct tortoises. At the Makauwahi Cave Reserve in Hawaii, exotic tortoises are being used as a replacement for the extinct moa-nalo, a large flightless duck hunted to extinction by the first Polynesians to reach Hawaii. The grazing habits of these tortoises control and reduce the spread of invasive plants, and promote the growth of native flora.\n\nExpanding populations\nExtant outside Australia\n\n\n"}

Similar to a pacemaker that monitors and responds to heart rhythms, the RNS System monitors and responds to brain activity. The RNS System is made by NeuroPace, Inc.\n\nThe RNS neurostimulator is a small, implantable device connected to leads (tiny wires) that are placed in up to two seizure onset areas. The device continuously monitors brain activity, detects abnormal patterns, and in response delivers imperceptible electrical pulses to normalize the activity before an individual experiences seizures.\n\nThe RNS System was FDA approved in 2013 to treat adults with partial onset seizures that are not controlled by medications. The RNS System is currently available in most Level 4 Comprehensive Epilepsy Centers throughout the United States and is broadly covered by private and government insurance. As of March, 2017 over 1,000 patients have been implanted with the RNS System.\n\nHow the RNS System helps prevent seizures:\n\nThe RNS System continuously monitors brain activity at the seizure source. It works in the background, without the patient feeling anything.\n\nThe device is programmed by physicians to detect early, abnormal electrical patterns that can lead to seizures. These patterns are different for every individual, and the device can be personalized to recognize each brain's unique \"fingerprint\".\n\nWithin milliseconds of detecting abnormal brain activity, the RNS System sends tiny electrical pulses to disrupt the abnormal activity and normalize brainwaves. This real-time response is designed to prevent seizures from occurring.\n\nThe RNS System is the only treatment option that monitors and responds to brain activity directly at the seizure source. It delivers treatment when needed, on average less than 6 minutes of stimulation per day.\n\nOnce implanted, the RNS System is unnoticeable under and individual's hair, and device setting are personalized so that the stimulation is not felt.\n\nA window to the brain: The RNS System is the only epilepsy therapy that also provides physicians clinically meaningful ongoing data about their patients’ seizure frequency and electrocorticographic activity. The patient uses a simple remote monitor at home to wirelessly collect and upload data from their neurostimulator. The data is made available to their doctor to review and analyze, so that they can improve patient care. The RNS System is surgically implanted in the skull by a trained neurosurgeon and typically involves an overnight stay in the hospital. The therapy is reversible; the procedure does not involve removing any brain tissue. For many medically refractory partial-onset epilepsy patients who are not candidates for epilepsy surgery, the RNS System provides a clinically proven therapy option to reduce seizure frequency and improve quality of life.\n\nThe RNS System Clinical Summary:\n\nThe RNS System was evaluated in a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded clinical study—one of the largest and most rigorously conducted pivotal trials for any neuromodulation technology. The study included adults who have medically refractory, partial onset seizures with up to two localized seizure foci, and who had failed at least two medications. In total, 191 patients were randomized 1:1 to either treatment with the RNS System or sham stimulation. After the four month blinded period, stimulation was turned on for all patients. Treatment with the RNS System resulted in statistically significant seizure reductions compared to the sham group. By the end of the blinded period, patients in the Treatment group had a 41.5% reduction in disabling seizures compared to 9.4% in the Sham group (p=0.008). The safety profile of the RNS System compared favorably to deep brain stimulation as well as implantation of intracranial electrodes and epilepsy surgery (Morrell, 2011).\n\nPatients treated with the RNS System experience substantial seizure reductions in the first year that continue to improve over time. At seven years, patients achieved a 72% median reduction in seizures (Bergey, 2015). Quality of life (QOL) and mood are often negatively affected by epilepsy, particularly in patients with poorly controlled seizures. Patients treated with the RNS System reported statistically significant improvements in mood and overall quality of life, including physical health, mental health, cognitive effects, and seizure worry (Meador, 2015).\n\nPatients treated with the RNS System show no evidence of cognitive decline. In fact, they have demonstrated statistically significant\nimprovements in naming and verbal memory. This is meaningful because individuals with epilepsy are at risk for cognitive disability and\ndecline which has also been associated with other epilepsy treatments. For example, many antiepileptic drugs have adverse cognitive\neffects, patients treated with deep brain stimulation have reported cognitive decline, and epilepsy surgery carries risks for decline in\ncognitive areas specifically related to those regions of the brain that are resected (Loring, 2015).\nAnother notable feature of the RNS system is the subtle, virtually imperceptible, nature of the therapy. Device settings are personalized\nso that patients do not feel or notice the stimulation. This is in contrast to other therapies, such as vagus nerve stimulation, which can\nhave chronic stimulation-related side effects such as voice alterations, coughing, throat discomfort, and shortness of breath.\n\n\n\nMedia Contacts:\nHillary Marder\nMSL Group for NeuroPace\nhillary.marder@mslgroup.com\n"}

{"id": "190057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190057", "title": "Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)", "text": "Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)\n\nSymphony No. 4 in G major by Gustav Mahler was written in 1899 and 1900, though it incorporates a song originally written in 1892. The song, \"Das himmlische Leben\", presents a child's vision of Heaven. It is sung by a soprano in the work's fourth and final movement. Although typically described as being in the key of G major, the symphony employs a progressive tonal scheme ('(b)/G—E').\n\nMahler's first four symphonies are often referred to as the \"Wunderhorn\" symphonies because many of their themes originate in earlier songs by Mahler on texts from \"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\" (\"The Boy's Magic Horn\"). The fourth symphony is built around a single song, \"Das himmlische Leben\" (\"The Heavenly Life\"). It is prefigured in various ways in the first three movements and sung in its entirety by a solo soprano in the fourth movement.\n\nMahler composed \"Das himmlische Leben\" as a freestanding piece in 1892. The title is Mahler's own: in the \"Wunderhorn\" collection the poem is called \"Der Himmel hängt voll Geigen\" (an idiomatic expression akin to \"there's not a cloud in the sky\"). Several years later Mahler considered using the song as the seventh and final movement of his Symphony No. 3. While motifs from \"Das himmlische Leben\" are found in the Symphony No. 3, Mahler eventually decided not to include it in that work and, instead, made the song the goal and source of his Symphony No. 4. This symphony thus presents a thematic fulfilment of the musical world of No. 3, which is part of the larger tetralogy of the first four symphonies, as Mahler described them to Natalie Bauer-Lechner. Early plans in which the Symphony was projected as a six-movement work included another \"Wunderhorn\" song, \"Das irdische Leben\" (\"The Earthly Life\") as a somber pendant to \"Das himmlische Leben\", offering a tableau of childhood starvation in juxtaposition to heavenly abundance, but Mahler later decided on a simpler structure for the score.\n\nA typical performance of the symphony lasts about an hour, making it one of Mahler's shorter symphonies. The performing forces are also small by Mahler's usual standard.\n\nThe movements of the symphony:\n\nFlutes and sleigh bells open the unusually restrained first movement (and used later with a melodic theme known commonly as the 'bell theme', which helps define sections throughout the movement) often described as possessing classical poise. \nAs would be expected for the first movement of a symphony, the first movement of Mahler's Symphony No. 4 is in sonata form.\n\nThe primary theme:\nThe secondary theme:\n\nThe second movement is a scherzo that features a part for a solo violin whose strings are tuned a whole tone higher than usual.\nThe violin depicts Freund Hein, (lit. \"Friend Henry\") a figure from medieval German art; Hain (or Hein) is a traditional German personification of death, invented by poet Matthias Claudius. Freund Hein is a skeleton who plays the fiddle and leads a Totentanz or \"danse macabre\". According to Mahler's widow, Alma, Mahler took inspiration for this movement from an 1872 painting by the Swiss artist Arnold Bocklin entitled \"Self-Portrait with Death playing the Fiddle\". The scherzo represents his dance and the unusual tuning of the violin adds tension to its sound and contributes to the music's ghostly character.\n\nThe third movement is a solemn processional march cast as a set of variations. Mahler uses the theme and variation structure in a more unconventional way. This movement can be divided into five main sections: A1 – B1 – A2 – B2 – A3 – coda. The theme is presented in the first 16 bars of A1,\nbut the true variations do not appear until section A3, although the theme is developed slightly within the preceding sections; sections A1, A2, B1 and B2 are in bar form. This movement remains mostly in G major, but does modulate to D minor, E minor and E major; the B2 section has a rather unstable tonality, being more chromatic and moving through many keys.\n\nThe fourth movement opens with a relaxed, bucolic scene in G major.\nA child, voiced by a soprano, presents a sunny, naive vision of Heaven and describes the feast being prepared for all the saints.\nThe scene has its darker elements: the child makes it clear that the heavenly feast takes place at the expense of animals, including a sacrificed lamb. The child's narrative is punctuated by faster passages recapitulating the first movement. Unlike the final movement of traditional symphonies, the fourth movement of Mahler's No. 4 is essentially a song, containing verses, with interludes, a prelude and a postlude (a strophic structure). By the time the postlude is heard, there is a modulation to E major (the tonic major of the relative minor) and unusually stays in this key, ending the symphony away from the tonic of G major. Several ties to Symphony No. 3 can be heard in these passages as well.\n\nThe symphony is scored for fairly small orchestra by Mahler's standards, consisting of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, Denmark on 19 May 1838 with \"The True Soldier\" (one-act verse play) and \"That Was Done by the Zombie\" (poem) in \"Three Poetical Works\".\n\nReitzel paid Andersen 40 rixdollars for the story. In the tale, Andersen continues to perfect his colloquial style. Andersen read the tale aloud in the late 1830s with his novel \"Only a Fiddler\". The tale irritated the young Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard with its satirical portrait of a bird that babbles on endlessly in a philosophical vein.\n\nThe story is set in Copenhagen. A group of guests are holding a large party. During the festivity Counciler of Justice Knap argues that the Middle Ages were a time better than their own, more specifically the time of King Hans. Suddenly two fairies arrive, dressed up as house maids. One is old, Dame Care, the other is a minion of Dame Fortune. The dame has brought a pair of galoshes along that can transport whoever wears them to whatever time, place or condition in life that he desires. And his every wish in regard to time and place will be instantly granted. Dame Care predicts that it will nevertheless make the person unhappy, wishing he was back in the present.\n\nAs the party concludes Councilor Knap decides to go home. He finds the galoshes, puts them on and is sent back to the reign of King Hans. He is not immediately aware of what happened, but does notice that the unpaved streets are full with filth and mud. He notices a procession for the Bishop of Seeland and assumes it's for the bishop from his time period. As he wants to cross the bridge to Palace Square he notices it's gone and ask two men in a boat where the bridge is and that he wants to go to Christian's Harbour on Little Market Street. The men have no idea what he is talking about and Knap has trouble understanding their speech, which he assumes is an accent that belongs to people of Bornholm. As a result, he continues his walk, frustrated that not only the bridge is gone and all the lights are out, but that there are also no cabs to take. He decides to walk back to the East Street, but to his amazement the East Gate is now a meadow. Knap assumes he must be ill and desperately wants to go home, but he can't recognize any of the buildings. As he enters a tavern he tries to find his local paper, but they don't have it. When he notices a woodcut of a meteor over Cologne he wonders where the owners \"got this rare old print?\". As he discusses the content he gets into a conversation in Latin with a man who holds a bachelor in theology. They discuss many topics and Knap keeps misinterpreting these medieval topics for events that happened in his own lifetime. For instance, he confuses a remark about the Black Plague with a reference to a cholera epidemic in the 19th century. As the evening continues they all begin to drink more and Knap is repulsed by the vulgar behaviour of the people. He decides to sneak out, but the others pull him back from under the table by his feet, thereby pulling off the galoshes and breaking the spell. Waking up in his own age Knapp assumes it was all a dream and now fancies his own time period as the best.\n\nNext, a watchman tries the galoshes on. He wishes to be the lieutenant, because he assumes his life is much better than his. The galoshes do their work and suddenly the watchmen becomes the lieutenant, sitting at his desk. He notices the lieutenant had written a poem called, \"If Only I Were Rich\", which confesses that the lieutenant actually feels he is short on money and is lonely as a result. Then he realizes he would rather be a watchman, because he at least has a wife and children who share his joy and sorrows. The galoshes then transform him back into himself. The watchman, still unaware what has happened, watches a falling star. He wishes he could travel to the moon and suddenly the galoshes send him there at the speed of light. There he meets several moon men who all wonder whether Earth is inhabited and decide this must be impossible. Back on Earth the lifeless body of the watchman is found and he is brought to a hospital, where they take his shoes off, breaking the spell again. He awakens and declares it to have been the most terrible night he had ever experienced.\n\nAs the galoshes remain in the hospital one of the young night internes tries them on. His task is to guard the hospital fence, but he wishes to get out for a while, wondering whether he \"could get his head through the fence and escape.\" As soon as he thinks this his head is stuck and he's unable to pull it back. He struggles for a while, until he wishes he was free again, which is granted by the galoshes. The next day the intern attends a theatrical play called \"My Grandmother's Spectacles\" in Kannike Street. The spectacles in the play are able to let anyone who wears them read the future from people's faces. The internee wishes he had such a pair of glasses and soon enough he has them. As he witnesses into the spectators' on the front row's hearts he notices all kinds of bizarre views. He concludes he must have had too much blood rushing to his head and wishes he could take a Russian steam bath. Suddenly he is indeed there, but fully clothed and scaring off the other people in the room. He has enough sense to pull himself together and tell everybody it's part of a bet. He then returns home and the next day he has a blistered back.\n\nMeanwhile, the watchman picks up the galoshes at the hospital and turns them in at the police station where they are accidentally given to a clerk whose galoshes happened to have been lost too. During a walk the clerk meets a friend who is a poet and desires to live his life, for it seems to be much more enjoyable than his. At first the clerk enjoys being a poet full of inspiration. Then he wishes he was a lark, but is caught by a little boy and sold off to a family, where he is put inside a cage. He talks with a canary and parrot, who both lament the days when they were still free. As it so happens the cage door is open and the clerk tries to fly away, but is attacked by a cat. He manages to fly back to his own home, where the spell is broken again.\n\nThen the fairy tale concludes with the clerk's neighbour, a theological student, asking for the galoshes. The clerk gives them to him. As the student walks away he wishes he could travel to Switzerland and Italy, whereupon he is on top of the Mont Blanc. In the freezing weather he wishes he was on the other side of the Alps, where he ends up in Italy, near Lake Thrasymene. There he enjoys the beautiful landscapes, but he is confronted with the local people's hunger and poverty. He concludes that it would be better off if his body could rest, while the spirit flies on without it. The galoshes grant his wish and he is now peacefully dead. Andersen concludes with a quote by Solon: \"Call no man happy until he rests in his grave.\" Dame Care then tells the other fairy that her predictions have indeed all came true. Though she does grant the student a favor. She takes off his galoshes and takes them back with her, causing him to be brought back to life.\n\n\n"}

During this period, Monaco designed more than 450 projects, of which approximately 100 were built. His work can be seen in buildings in Rome, Pisa, Naples, and Taranto, as well as in Dalmatia, Iran, France, and Tunisia.\n\nEven before receiving a degree in architecture from Sapienza University of Rome in 1934, Monaco collaborated with F. Petrucci and C. Longo in national competitions; one in 1933 to design four new postal buildings in Rome, and one in 1934 to design the Clinical Hospital of Modena. In 1936, he worked with G. Calza Bini, S. Muratori, F. Petrucci, Ludovico Quaroni, and E. Tedeschi on the sixth Triennale di Milano.\n\nIn 1937, Monaco began working with Luccichenti, a partnership that would last until 1963. Together, they worked on the Augustine Exhibition of the Roman Empire (Italian: \"Mostra Augustea della Romanità\") and the Palazzo dei Congressi in EUR, Rome, in 1938; buildings at the Circus Maximus in 1953; the Olympic Village for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome from 1958–60; Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport from 1957–60; the SIAE building in EUR from 1963–65, the Roccaraso Church in 1966; and the Jolly Hotel in Rome in 1968.\n\nThe collaboration between Monaco and Luccichenti influenced the design of a number of apartment buildings, villas, and Roman houses from 1945 to 1955. They were noted for their experimental and rational style, which can be seen in several buildings in Rome, including the office of the Shipping Company of Italy, KLM's air travel agency on Via Barberini, a Lancia dealership, and the SIAE building on Via Emanuele Gianturco; the restructurations of Caffè Rosati in via Veneto at the 1946 and the night club Le Pleiadi in via Sistina, 1947, both places of worship of Dolce Vita.\n\nAt the end of the 1950s, the Monaco-Luccichenti Studio was chosen by the Ministry of Public Works to manage the international engineering and architectural work for the 1960 Summer Olympics, including the Olympic Village, in collaboration with Adalberto Libera, Luigi Moretti, Vittorio Cafiero, and Pier Luigi Nervi.\n\nIn 1955, during the presidency of Giovanni Gronchi, Monaco realized the restructuring of the Lupa Hall at Palazzo Montecitorio. Other works include the enlargement of Castelporziano, the official palace in San Rossore, the Villa Maria Pia in the estate of the president, Villa Rosebery in Naples.\n\nOther works to remember are: In Rome in 1948, Palazzina Street S.

Brenton Hall was son of Rev. Samuel Hall of Cheshire (Yale, 1716). Described by Ezra Stiles as the wealthiest minister in Connecticut, the Rev. Hall owned extensive properties in central Connecticut, as well as land inherited from his mother's prominent Rhode Island family, the Brentons.\n\nHall was extraordinarily well-connected. His uncle, Jonathan Law (Harvard 1695), served as Governor (1741–1750) and Chief Justice of Connecticut (1724–1741). His great-grandfather, served on the Governor's Council. His cousin, Lyman Hall, would serve as Governor of Georgia and would be signer of the Declaration of Independence. His uncle Elihu Hall (Yale 1731) was King's Attorney for the Colony. The land-rich Halls and their kin were pillars of the Old Light faction of Congregationalists that opposed the Great Awakening and the ascendant commercial interests associated with it.\n\nWilliam Brenton Hall attended local schools and was prepared for Yale by the Rev. Enoch Huntington of Middletown. He entered the college in 1782. On graduating in 1786, he went to Philadelphia to attend medical lectures at Pennsylvania Hospital, then completed his training with Dr. Jared Potter of Wallingford (Yale 1760). He set up practice in Middletown, then the largest city in the state and one of its most prosperous seaports.\n\nIn 1796, Dr. Hall married Mehetable Parsons, daughter of Revolutionary hero, Major General Samuel Holden Parsons (Harvard 1756), who had died while serving as Chief Justice of the Northwest Territory. The marriage brought him substantial land holdings in Ohio, as well as a host of distinguished relatives, including brothers-in-law, Stephen Titus Hosmer, who would become Chief Justice of the State of Connecticut, Enoch Parsons, who would head the Middletown branch of the Bank of the United States, and Samuel Holden Parsons, who would long serve as High Sheriff of Middlesex County.\n\nBetter prepared than most of his apprenticeship-trained contemporaries, Hall quickly became one of the leading physicians in the state. He pioneered obstetrics, guided by the detailed illustrated manuals, published in Edinburgh, that he brought back from his studies in Philadelphia. He was particularly concerned with epidemic disease, repeatedly petitioning town authorities in Wallingford and Middletown for permission to establish a \"pock house\" for inoculating against small pox.\n\nHall's anti-federalist political inclinations may have helped him to develop a relationship with Boston physician Benjamin Waterhouse, a correspondent of British physician Edward Jenner, discoverer of vaccination. Jenner sent samples of cowpox matter to Waterhouse, some of which may have been passed on to Hall, who appears to have been the first physician in Connecticut to practice vaccination.\n\nIn 1796, Hall played a heroic role during a yellow fever epidemic at Knowles Landing, south of Middletown on the Connecticut River. When all the village's established physicians had fled, Hall stayed on to care for the sick and bury the dead. His exploits were reported in Miner & Tully's \"Essays on Fevers\" (1823), a pioneering study of epidemic disease.\n\nHall played a leading role in organizing the Connecticut Medical Society and served as its treasurer from 1799 until his death a decade later. He was noted as an educator of physicians and often had as many as six apprentices residing with him in his spacious house on Middletown's Main Street (William Brenton Hall Account Book, 1807–1809).\n\nAs Federalists struggled to take control of the Medical Society in 1807, Hall and his Jeffersonian friends, who were officers of the society, became the object of a vicious satirical poem by physician and wit, Mason Fitch Cogswell:\n\nAccording to his contemporaries, alcoholism was an occupational disease for physicians in this era. Hall, known to be a heavy drinker, began to fail in the spring of 1809. Attempting to visit a patient in June 1809, he fell from his horse and died of his injuries on June 29, aged 45. He was buried in the Liberty Street Cemetery in Middletown. He left a widow and two young sons, William Brenton Hall Jr. and State Senator Samuel H. P. Hall (1804–1877).\n\nDespite the advantages of pedigree and education, Hall was handicapped by the time and place in which he lived. The extensive kinship network of which he was a part would have served him well had the Old Lights been able to maintain their political dominance. Defeats at the polls and in ecclesiastical tribunals pushed them to the margins. Many, like Hall and his father Brenton (who represented Meriden in the legislature for many terms), became anti-federalists and ardent Jeffersonians. Others, like Hall's siblings, abandoned the established Congregational church for dissenting sects. This constituted a major obstacle to success in a state dominated by an oppressive Federalist-Congregationalist political machine.\n\nHad Hall followed his Yale classmate, fellow physician Elihu Hubbard Smith, to New York City—where political and religious heterodoxy was tolerated --, he might have had a more distinguished career. Smith, who also studied medicine at Pennsylvania Hospital, established himself in New York, where he founded America's first medical journal, the \"Medical Repository\".\n\n"}
