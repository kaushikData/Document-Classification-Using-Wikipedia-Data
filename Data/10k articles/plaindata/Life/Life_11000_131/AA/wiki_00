The species name was selected by visitors to the museum, in efforts to connect members of the public to issues of taxonomy and the description of biodiversity.\n\n\"A. dementor\" is colored in red and black. Its mandibles and most of its clypeus, prothorax, mesothorax, and posterolateral areas are all light red, while its abdomen and much of its head is black. Its wings are slightly yellow. It has long, slender legs, and a tubular petiole, as long as the tergum. Female length varies between 9.6 and 10.9 mm; the male length is unknown.\n\nThe wasp has an unusual behavior towards cockroaches. As it stings its prey, it releases a toxin into the victim's neural nodes. This toxin blocks the cockroach's octopamine receptors, leaving the cockroach alive, but unable to direct its movements. Its muscle functions still active, the cockroach then \"runs into\" the wasp's nest, allowing for its easier capture by the wasp.\n\nAt the time of the wasp's description, visitors to the Museum für Naturkunde (in which the species was described) were asked through pamphlet distribution to choose between four names, of which the third was chosen:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3409", "title": "Being", "text": "Being\n\nIn philosophy, being means the existence of a thing. Anything that exists has being. Ontology is the branch of philosophy that studies being. Being is a concept encompassing objective and subjective features of reality and existence. Anything that partakes in being is also called a \"being\", though often this usage is limited to entities that have subjectivity (as in the expression \"human being\"). The notion of \"being\" has, inevitably, been elusive and controversial in the history of philosophy, beginning in Western philosophy with attempts among the pre-Socratics to deploy it intelligibly. The first effort to recognize and define the concept came from Parmenides, who famously said of it that \"what is-is\". Common words such as \"is\", \"are\", and \"am\" refer directly or indirectly to being.\n\nAs an example of efforts in recent times, Martin Heidegger (who himself drew on ancient Greek sources) adopted after German terms like \"Dasein\" to articulate the topic. Several modern approaches build on such continental European exemplars as Heidegger, and apply metaphysical results to the understanding of human psychology and the human condition generally (notably in the Existentialist tradition). By contrast, in mainstream Analytical philosophy the topic is more confined to abstract investigation, in the work of such influential theorists as W. V. O. Quine, to name one of many. One of the most fundamental questions that continues to exercise philosophers is posed by William James: \"How comes the world to be here at all instead of the nonentity which might be imagined in its place? ... from nothing to being there is no logical bridge.\"\n\nThe deficit of such a bridge was first encountered in history by the Pre-Socratic philosophers during the process of evolving a classification of all beings (noun). Aristotle, who wrote after the Pre-Socratics, applies the term category (perhaps not originally) to ten highest-level classes. They comprise one category of substance (ousiae) existing independently (man, tree) and nine categories of accidents, which can only exist in something else (time, place). In Aristotle, substances are to be clarified by stating their definition: a note expressing a larger class (the genus) followed by further notes expressing specific differences (differentiae) within the class. The substance so defined was a species. For example, the species, man, may be defined as an animal (genus) that is rational (difference). As the difference is potential within the genus; that is, an animal may or may not be rational, the difference is not identical to, and may be distinct from, the genus.\n\nApplied to being, the system fails to arrive at a definition for the simple reason that no difference can be found. The species, the genus, and the difference are all equally being: a being is a being that is being. The genus cannot be nothing because nothing is not a class of everything. The trivial solution that being is being added to nothing is only a tautology: being is being. There is no simpler intermediary between being and non-being that explains and classifies being.\nPre-Socratic reaction to this deficit was varied. As substance theorists they accepted a priori the hypothesis that appearances are deceiving, that reality is to be reached through reasoning. Parmenides reasoned that if everything is identical to being and being is a category of the same thing then there can be neither differences between things nor any change. To be different, or to change, would amount to becoming or being non-being; that is, not existing. Therefore, being is a homogeneous and non-differentiated sphere and the appearance of beings is illusory. Heraclitus, on the other hand, foreshadowed modern thought by denying existence. Reality does not exist, it flows, and beings are an illusion upon the flow.\n\nAristotle knew of this tradition when he began his \"Metaphysics\", and had already drawn his own conclusion, which he presented under the guise of asking what being is:\"And indeed the question which was raised of old is raised now and always, and is always the subject of doubt, viz., what being is, is just the question, what is substance? For it is this that some assert to be one, others more than one, and that some assert to be limited in number, others unlimited. And so we also must consider chiefly and primarily and almost exclusively what that is which is in this sense.\"\n\nand reiterates in no uncertain terms: \"Nothing, then, which is not a species of a genus will have an essence – only species will have it ...\". Being, however, for Aristotle, is not a genus.\n\nOne might expect a solution to follow from such certain language but none does. Instead Aristotle launches into a rephrasing of the problem, the Theory of Act and Potency. In the definition of man as a two-legged animal Aristotle presumes that \"two-legged\" and \"animal\" are parts of other beings, but as far as man is concerned, are only potentially man. At the point where they are united into a single being, man, the being, becomes actual, or real. Unity is the basis of actuality: \"... 'being' is being combined and one, and 'not being' is being not combined but more than one.\" Actuality has taken the place of existence, but Aristotle is no longer seeking to know what the actual is; he accepts it without question as something generated from the potential. He has found a \"half-being\" or a \"pre-being\", the potency, which is fully being as part of some other substance. Substances, in Aristotle, unite what they actually are now with everything they might become.\n\nSome of Thomas Aquinas' propositions were reputedly condemned by Étienne Tempier, the local Bishop of Paris (not the Papal Magisterium itself) in 1270 and 1277, but his dedication to the use of philosophy to elucidate theology was so thorough that he was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church in 1568. Those who adopt it are called Thomists.\n\nIn a single sentence, parallel to Aristotle's statement asserting that being is substance, St. Thomas pushes away from the Aristotelian doctrine: \"Being is not a genus, since it is not predicated univocally but only analogically.\" His term for analogy is Latin \"analogia\". In the categorical classification of all beings, all substances are partly the same: man and chimpanzee are both animals and the animal part in man is \"the same\" as the animal part in chimpanzee. Most fundamentally all substances are matter, a theme taken up by science, which postulated one or more matters, such as earth, air, fire or water (Empedocles). In today's chemistry the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in a chimpanzee are identical to the same elements in a man.\n\nThe original text reads, \"Although equivocal predications must be reduced to univocal, still in actions, the non-univocal agent must precede the univocal agent. For the non-univocal agent is the universal cause of the whole species, as for instance the sun is the cause of the generation of all men; whereas the univocal agent is not the universal efficient cause of the whole species (otherwise it would be the cause of itself, since it is contained in the species), but is a particular cause of this individual which it places under the species by way of participation. Therefore the universal cause of the whole species is not an univocal agent; and the universal cause comes before the particular cause. But this universal agent, whilst it is not univocal, nevertheless is not altogether equivocal, otherwise it could not produce its own likeness, but rather it is to be called an analogical agent, as all univocal predications are reduced to one first non-univocal analogical predication, which is being.\"\n\nIf substance is the highest category and there is no substance, being, then the unity perceived in all beings by virtue of their existing must be viewed in another way. St. Thomas chose the analogy: all beings are like, or analogous to, each other in existing. This comparison is the basis of his Analogy of Being. The analogy is said of being in many different ways, but the key to it is the real distinction between existence and essence. Existence is the principle that gives reality to an essence not the same in any way as the existence: \"If things having essences are real, and it is not of their essence to be, then the reality of these things must be found in some principle other than (really distinct from) their essence.\" Substance can be real or not. What makes an individual substance – a man, a tree, a planet – real is a distinct act, a \"to be\", which actuates its unity. An analogy of proportion is therefore possible: \"essence is related to existence as potency is related to act.\"\n\nExistences are not things; they do not themselves exist, they lend themselves to essences, which do not intrinsically have them. They have no nature; an existence receives its nature from the essence it actuates. Existence is not being; it gives being – here a customary phrase is used, existence is a principle (a source) of being, not a previous source, but one which is continually in effect. The stage is set for the concept of God as the cause of all existence, who, as the Almighty, holds everything actual without reason or explanation as an act purely of will.\n\nAristotle's classificatory scheme had included the five predicables, or characteristics that might be predicated of a substance. One of these was the property, an essential universal true of the species, but not in the definition (in modern terms, some examples would be grammatical language, a property of man, or a spectral pattern characteristic of an element, both of which are defined in other ways). Pointing out that predicables are predicated univocally of substances; that is, they refer to \"the same thing\" found in each instance, St. Thomas argued that whatever can be said about being is not univocal, because all beings are unique, each actuated by a unique existence. It is the analogous possession of an existence that allows them to be identified as being; therefore, being is an analogous predication.\n\nWhatever can be predicated of all things is universal-like but not universal, category-like but not a category. St. Thomas called them (perhaps not originally) the \"transcendentia\", \"transcendentals\", because they \"climb above\" the categories, just as being climbs above substance. Later academics also referred to them as \"the properties of being.\" The number is generally three or four.\n\nThe nature of \"being\" has also been debated and explored in Islamic philosophy, notably by Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Suhrawardi, and Mulla Sadra. A modern linguistic approach which notices that Persian language has exceptionally developed two kinds of \"is\"es, i.e. \"ast\" (\"is\", as a copula) and \"hast\" (as an existential \"is\") examines the linguistic properties of the two lexemes in the first place, then evaluates how the statements made by other languages with regard to \"being\" can stand the test of Persian frame of reference.\n\nIn this modern linguistic approach, it is noticed that the original language of the source, e.g. Greek (like German or French or English), has only one word for two concepts, \"ast\" and \"hast\", or, like Arabic, has no word at all for either word. It therefore exploits the Persian \"hast\" (existential \"is\") versus \"ast\" (predicative \"is\" or copula) to address both Western and Islamic ontological arguments on \"being\" and \"existence\".\n\nThis linguistic method shows the scope of confusion created by languages which cannot differentiate between existential be and copula. It manifests, for instance, that the main theme of Heidegger's \"Being and Time\" is \"astī\" (is-ness) rather than \"hastī\" (existence). When, in the beginning of his book, Heidegger claims that people always talk about existence in their everyday language, without knowing what it means, the example he resorts to is: \"the sky \"is\" blue\" which in Persian can be ONLY translated with the use of the copula \"ast\", and says nothing about \"being\" or \"existence\".\n\nIn the same manner, the linguistic method addresses the ontological works written in Arabic. Since Arabic, like Latin in Europe, had become the official language of philosophical and scientific works in the so-called Islamic World, the early Persian or Arab philosophers had difficulty discussing \"being\" or \"existence\", since the Arabic language, like other Semitic languages, had no verb for either predicative \"be\" (copula) or existential \"be\". So if you try to translate the aforementioned Heidegger's example into Arabic it appears as السماء زرقاء (viz. \"The Sky-- blue\") with no linking \"is\" to be a sign of existential statement. To overcome the problem, when translating the ancient Greek philosophy, certain words were coined like ایس \"aysa\" (from Arabic لیس \"laysa\" 'not') for 'is'. Eventually the Arabic verb وجد \"wajada\" (to find) prevailed, since it was thought that whatever is existent, is to be \"found\" in the world. Hence \"existence\" or Being was called وجود \"wujud\" (Cf. Swedish \"finns\" [found]> there exist; also the Medieval Latin coinage of \"exsistere\" 'standing out (there in the world)' > appear> exist). Now, with regard to the fact that Persian, as the mother tongue of both Avicenna and Sadrā, was in conflict with either Greek or Arabic in this regard, these philosophers should have been warned implicitly by their mother tongue not to confuse two kinds of linguistic beings (viz. copula vs. existential). In fact when analyzed thoroughly, copula, or Persian \"ast\" ('is') indicates an ever-moving chain of relations with no fixed \"entity\" to hold onto (every \"entity\", say A, will be dissolved into \"A is B\" and so on, as soon as one tries to define it). Therefore, the whole reality or what we see as existence (\"found\" in our world) resembles an ever-changing world of \"astī\" (is-ness) flowing in time and space. On the other hand, while Persian \"ast\" can be considered as the 3rd person singular of the verb 'to be', there is no verb but an arbitrary one supporting \"hast\" ('is' as an existential be= exists) has neither future nor past tense and nor a negative form of its own: \"hast\" is just a single untouchable lexeme. It needs no other linguistic element to be complete (\"Hast.\" is a complete sentence meaning \"s/he it exists\"). In fact, any manipulation of the arbitrary verb, e.g. its conjugation, turns \"hast\" back into a copula.\n\nEventually from such linguistic analyses, it appears that while \"astī\" (is-ness) would resemble the world of Heraclitus, \"hastī\" (existence) would rather approaches a metaphysical concept resembling the Parmenidas's interpretation of \"existence\".\n\nIn this regard, Avicenna, who was a firm follower of Aristotle, could not accept either Heraclitian \"is-ness\" (where only constant was \"change\"), nor Parmenidean \"monist immoveable existence\" (the \"hastī\" itself being constant). To solve the contradiction, it so appeared to Philosophers of Islamic world that Aristotle considered the core of existence (i.e. its \"substance\"/\"essence\") as a fixed constant, while its facade (accident) was prone to change. To translate such a philosophical image into Persian it is like having \"hastī\" (existence) as a unique constant core covered by \"astī\" (is-ness) as a cloud of ever-changing relationships. It is clear that the Persian language, deconstructs such a composite as a sheer mirage, since it is not clear how to link the interior core (existence) with the exterior shell (is-ness). Furthermore, \"hast\" cannot be linked to anything but itself (as it is self-referent).\n\nThe argument has a theological echos as well: assuming that God is the \"Existence\", beyond time and space, a question is raised by philosophers of the Islamic world as how he, as a transcendental existence, may ever create or contact a world of \"is-ness\" in space-time.\n\nHowever, Avicenna who was more philosopher than theologian, followed the same line of argumentation as that of his ancient master, Aristotle, and tried to reconcile between \"ast\" and \"hast\", by considering the latter as higher order of existence than the former. It is like a hierarchical order of existence. It was a philosophical Tower of Babel that the restriction of his own mother tongue (Persian) would not allow to be built, but he could maneuver in Arabic by giving the two concepts the same name \"wujud\", although with different attributes. So, implicitly, \"astī\" (is-ness) appears as ممکن الوجود \"momken-al-wujud\" (contingent being), and \"hastī\" (existence) as واجب الوجود \"wājeb-al-wujud\" (necessary being).\n\nOn the other hand, centuries later, Sadrā, chose a more radical route, by inclining towards the reality of \"astī\" (is-ness), as the true mode of existence, and tried to get rid of the concept of \"hastī\" (existence as fixed or immovable). Thus, in his philosophy, the universal movement penetrates deep into the Aristotelian \"substance\"/\"essence\", in unison with changing accident. He called this deep existential change حرکت جوهری \"harekat-e jowhari\" (Substantial Movement). In such a changing existence, the whole world has to go through instantaneous annihilation and recreation incessantly, while as Avicenna had predicted in his remarks on Nature, such a universal change or substantial movement would eventually entail the shortening and lengthening of time as well which has never been observed. This logical objection, which was made on Aristotle's argumentation, could not be answered in the ancient times or medieval age, but now it does not sound contradictory to the real nature of Time (as addressed in relativity theory), so by a reverse argument, a philosopher may indeed deduce that everything is changing (moving) even in the deepest core of Being.\n\nAlthough innovated in the late medieval period, Thomism was dogmatized in the Renaissance. From roughly 1277 to 1567, it dominated the philosophic landscape. The rationalist philosophers, however, with a new emphasis on Reason as a tool of the intellect, brought the classical and medieval traditions under new scrutiny, exercising a new concept of doubt, with varying outcomes. Foremost among the new doubters were the empiricists, the advocates of scientific method, with its emphasis on experimentation and reliance on evidence gathered from sensory experience. In parallel with the revolutions against rising political absolutism based on established religion and the replacement of faith by reasonable faith, new systems of metaphysics were promulgated in the lecture halls by charismatic professors, such as Immanuel Kant, and Hegel. The late 19th and 20th centuries featured an emotional return to the concept of existence under the name of existentialism. These philosophers were concerned mainly with ethics and religion. The metaphysical side became the domain of the phenomenalists. In parallel with these philosophies Thomism continued under the protection of the Catholic Church; in particular, the Jesuit order.\n\nRationalism and empiricism have had many definitions, most concerned with specific schools of philosophy or groups of philosophers in particular countries, such as Germany. In general rationalism is the predominant school of thought in the multi-national, cross-cultural Age of reason, which began in the century straddling 1600 as a conventional date, empiricism is the reliance on sensory data gathered in experimentation by scientists of any country, who, in the Age of Reason were rationalists. An early professed empiricist, Thomas Hobbes, known as an eccentric denizen of the court of Charles II of England (an \"old bear\"), published in 1651 \"Leviathan\", a political treatise written during the English civil war, containing an early manifesto in English of rationalism.\nHobbes said:\"The Latines called Accounts of mony Rationes ... and thence it seems to proceed that they extended the word Ratio, to the faculty of Reckoning in all other things...When a man reasoneth hee does nothing else but conceive a summe totall ... For Reason ... is nothing but Reckoning ... of the consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the marking and signifying of our thoughts ...\"\nIn Hobbes reasoning is the right process of drawing conclusions from definitions (the \"names agreed upon\"). He goes on to define error as self-contradiction of definition (\"an absurdity, or senselesse Speech\") or conclusions that do not follow the definitions on which they are supposed to be based. Science, on the other hand, is the outcome of \"right reasoning,\" which is based on \"natural sense and imagination\", a kind of sensitivity to nature, as \"nature it selfe cannot erre.\"\n\nHaving chosen his ground carefully Hobbes launches an epistemological attack on metaphysics. The academic philosophers had arrived at the Theory of Matter and Form from consideration of certain natural paradoxes subsumed under the general heading of the Unity Problem. For example, a body appears to be one thing and yet it is distributed into many parts. Which is it, one or many? Aristotle had arrived at the real distinction between matter and form, metaphysical components whose interpenetration produces the paradox. The whole unity comes from the substantial form and the distribution into parts from the matter. Inhering in the parts giving them really distinct unities are the accidental forms. The unity of the whole being is actuated by another really distinct principle, the existence.\n\nIf nature cannot err, then there are no paradoxes in it; to Hobbes, the paradox is a form of the absurd, which is inconsistency: \"Natural sense and imagination, are not subject to absurdity\" and \"For error is but a deception ... But when we make a generall assertion, unlesse it be a true one, the possibility of it is inconceivable. And words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call Absurd ...\" Among Hobbes examples are \"round quadrangle\", \"immaterial substance\", \"free subject.\" Of the scholastics he says:\"Yet they will have us beleeve, that by the Almighty power of God, one body may be at one and the same time in many places [the problem of the universals]; and many bodies at one and the same time in one place [the whole and the parts]; ... And these are but a small part of the Incongruencies they are forced to, from their disputing philosophically, instead of admiring, and adoring of the Divine and Incomprehensible Nature ...\"\n\nThe real distinction between essence and existence, and that between form and matter, which served for so long as the basis of metaphysics, Hobbes identifies as \"the Error of Separated Essences.\" The words \"Is, or Bee, or Are, and the like\" add no meaning to an argument nor do derived words such as \"Entity, Essence, Essentially, Essentiality\", which \"are the names of nothing\" but are mere \"Signes\" connecting \"one name or attribute to another: as when we say, \"a man is a living body\", we mean not that the \"man\" is one thing, the \"living body\" another, and the \"is\", or \"being\" a third: but that the \"man\", and the \"living body\", is the same thing; ...\" Metaphysiques, Hobbes says, is \"far from the possibility of being understood\" and is \"repugnant to natural reason.\"\n\nBeing to Hobbes (and the other empiricists) is the physical universe:The world, (I mean ... the Universe, that is, the whole masse of all things that are) is corporeall, that is to say, Body; and hath the dimension of magnitude, namely, Length, Bredth and Depth: also every part of Body, is likewise Body ... and consequently every part of the Universe is Body, and that which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: and because the Universe is all, that which is no part of it is nothing; and consequently no where.\"\n\nHobbes' view is representative of his tradition. As Aristotle offered the categories and the act of existence, and Aquinas the analogy of being, the rationalists also had their own system, the great chain of being, an interlocking hierarchy of beings from God to dust.\n\nIn addition to the materialism of the empiricists, under the same aegis of Reason, rationalism produced systems that were diametrically opposed now called idealism, which denied the reality of matter in favor of the reality of mind. By a 20th-century classification, the idealists (Kant, Hegel and others), are considered the beginning of continental philosophy, while the empiricists are the beginning, or the immediate predecessors, of analytical philosophy. \n\nSome philosophers deny that the concept of \"being\" has any meaning at all, since we only define an object's existence by its relation to other objects, and actions it undertakes. The term \"I am\" has no meaning by itself; it must have an action or relation appended to it. This in turn has led to the thought that \"being\" and nothingness are closely related, developed in existential philosophy.\n\nExistentialist philosophers such as Sartre, as well as continental philosophers such as Hegel and Heidegger have also written extensively on the concept of being. Hegel distinguishes between the being of objects (being in itself) and the being of people (\"Geist)\". Hegel, however, did not think there was much hope for delineating a \"meaning\" of being, because being stripped of all predicates is simply nothing.\n\nHeidegger, in his quest to re-pose the original pre-Socratic question of Being, wondered at how to meaningfully ask the question of the meaning of being, since it is both the greatest, as it includes everything that is, and the least, since no particular thing can be said of it. He distinguishes between different modes of beings: a privative mode is present-at-hand, whereas beings in a fuller sense are described as ready-to-hand. The one who asks the question of Being is described as Da-sein (\"there/here-being\") or being-in-the-world. Sartre, popularly understood as misreading Heidegger (an understanding supported by Heidegger's essay \"Letter on Humanism\" which responds to Sartre's famous address, \"Existentialism is a Humanism\"), employs modes of being in an attempt to ground his concept of freedom ontologically by distinguishing between being-in-itself and being-for-itself.\n\nBeing is also understood as one's \"state of being,\" and hence its common meaning is in the context of human (personal) experience, with aspects that involve expressions and manifestations coming from an innate \"being\", or personal character. Heidegger coined the term \"dasein\" for this property of being in his influential work \"Being and Time\" (\"this entity which each of us is himself…we shall denote by the term 'dasein.'\"), in which he argued that being or \"dasein\" links one's sense of one's body to one's perception of world. Heidegger, amongst others, referred to an innate language as the foundation of being, which gives signal to all aspects of being.\n\n\nPhilosophers\n\n"}

Lee was the son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-chuen. He is widely considered by commentators, critics, media, and other martial artists to be one of the most influential martial artists of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century. He is often credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films.\n\nLee was born in Chinatown, San Francisco, on November 27, 1940, to parents from Hong Kong, and was raised with his family in Kowloon, Hong Kong. He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor. Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education at the University of Washington in Seattle, and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films dramatically changed and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in the US, Hong Kong, and the rest of the world.\n\nHe is noted for his roles in five feature-length films: Lo Wei's \"The Big Boss\" (1971) and \"Fist of Fury\" (1972); Golden Harvest's \"Way of the Dragon\" (1972), directed and written by Lee; Golden Harvest and Warner Brothers' \"Enter the Dragon\" (1973) and \"The Game of Death\" (1978), both directed by Robert Clouse. Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, based upon his portrayal of Chinese nationalism in his films and among Asian Americans for defying stereotypes associated with the emasculated Asian male. He trained in the art of Wing Chun and later combined his other influences from various sources into the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist). \nLee held dual nationality in Hong Kong and the US. He died in Kowloon Tong on July 20, 1973, at the age of 32.\n\nBruce Lee was born on November 27, 1940, at the Chinese Hospital, in San Francisco's Chinatown. According to the Chinese zodiac, Lee was born in both the hour and the year of the Dragon, which according to tradition is a strong and fortuitous omen. Lee and his parents returned to Hong Kong when he was three months old.\n\nBruce's father, Lee Hoi-chuen was Han Chinese, and his mother, Grace Ho (何愛瑜), was of Eurasian ancestry. Grace Ho was the adopted daughter of Ho Kom-tong (Ho Gumtong, 何甘棠) and the half-niece of Sir Robert Ho-tung, both notable Hong Kong businessmen and philanthropists. Bruce was the fourth of five children: Phoebe Lee (李秋源), Agnes Lee (李秋鳳), Peter Lee (李忠琛), and Robert Lee (李振輝).\n\nGrace's parentage remains unclear. Linda Lee, in her 1989 biography \"The Bruce Lee Story\", suggests that Grace had a German father and was a Catholic. Bruce Thomas, in his influential 1994 biography \"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit\", suggests that Grace had a Chinese mother and a German father. Lee's relative Eric Peter Ho, in his 2010 book \"Tracing My Children’s Lineage\", suggests that Grace was born in Shanghai to a Eurasian woman named Cheung King-sin. Eric Peter Ho said that Grace Lee was the daughter of a mixed race Shanghainese woman and her father was Ho Kom Tong. Grace Lee said her mother was English and her father was Chinese. Fredda Dudley Balling said Grace Lee was 3/4s Chinese and 1/4th British.\n\nHowever, in his 2018 biography, \"Bruce Lee; A Life\", Matthew Polly identifies Bruce's Lee's mother's grandfather as Moses Hartog Bosman. Born to a Jewish family in Rotterdam, Bosman became a successful businessman in Hong Kong, where he had a Chinese concubine named Sze Tai with whom he had six children, including Lee's grandfather Ho Kom Tong. Bosman subsequently abandoned his family and immigrated to California. Ho Kom Tong, however, became a wealthy businessman with a wife, 13 concubines, and 30 children, one of whom was °Grace Ho, Lee's mother.\n\nLee's Cantonese birth name was \"Lee Jun-fan\" (李振藩). The name homophonically means \"return again\", and was given to Lee by his mother, who felt he would return to the United States once he came of age. Because of his mother's superstitious nature, she had originally named him \"Sai-fon\" (細鳳), which is a feminine name meaning \"small phoenix\". The English name \"Bruce\" is thought to have been given by the hospital attending physician, Dr. Mary Glover.\n\nLee had three other Chinese names: Lee Yuen-cham (李源鑫), a family/clan name; Lee Yuen-kam (李元鑒), which he used as a student name while he was attending La Salle College, and his Chinese screen name Lee Siu-lung (李小龍; \"Siu-lung\" means \"little dragon\"). Lee's given name Jun-fan was originally written in Chinese as 震藩, however, the \"Jun\" (震) Chinese character was identical to part of his grandfather's name, Lee Jun-biu (李震彪). Hence, the Chinese character for \"Jun\" in Lee's name was changed to the homonym 振 instead, to avoid naming taboo in Chinese tradition.\n\nLee's father, Lee Hoi-chuen, was one of the leading Cantonese opera and film actors at the time and was embarking on a year-long opera tour with his family on the eve of the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong. Lee Hoi-chuen had been touring the United States for many years and performing in numerous Chinese communities there.\n\nAlthough many of his peers decided to stay in the US, Lee Hoi-chuen returned to Hong Kong after Bruce's birth. Within months, Hong Kong was invaded and the Lees lived for three years and eight months under Japanese occupation. After the war ended, Lee Hoi-chuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actor during Hong Kong's rebuilding years.\n\nLee's mother, Grace Ho, was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in Hong Kong, the Ho-tungs. She was the half-niece of Sir Robert Ho-tung, the Eurasian patriarch of the clan. As such, the young Bruce Lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment. Despite the advantage of his family's status, the neighborhood in which Lee grew up became overcrowded, dangerous, and full of gang rivalries due to an influx of refugees fleeing communist China for Hong Kong, at that time a British Crown colony.\n\nAfter Lee was involved in several street fights, his parents decided that he needed to be trained in the martial arts. Lee's first introduction to martial arts was through his father, from whom he learned the fundamentals of Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan.\n\nThe largest influence on Lee's martial arts development was his study of Wing Chun. Lee began training in Wing Chun when he was 16 years old under the Wing Chun teacher Yip Man in 1957, after losing several fights with rival gang members. Yip's regular classes generally consisted of the forms practice, \"chi sao\" (sticking hands) drills, wooden dummy techniques, and free-sparring. There was no set pattern to the classes. Yip tried to keep his students from fighting in the street gangs of Hong Kong by encouraging them to fight in organized competitions.\n\nAfter a year into his Wing Chun training, most of Yip Man's other students refused to train with Lee when they learned of his mixed ancestry, as the Chinese were generally against teaching their martial arts techniques to non-Asians. Lee's sparring partner, Hawkins Cheung, states, \"Probably fewer than six people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught, or even partly taught, by Yip Man\". However, Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun and continued to train privately with Yip Man and Wong Shun Leung in 1955. Wan Kam Leung, a student of Wong's, witnessed a sparring bout between Wong and Lee and noted the speed and precision with which Lee was able to deliver his kicks. Lee continued to train with Wong Shun Leung after returning to Hong Kong from America.\n\nAfter attending Tak Sun School (德信學校) (several blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road, Kowloon), Lee entered the primary school division of the Catholic La Salle College at the age of 12. In 1956, due to poor academic performance and possibly poor conduct, he was transferred to St. Francis Xavier's College (high school), where he would be mentored by Brother Edward, a teacher and coach of the school boxing team. In 1958, Bruce won the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament, knocking out the previous champion in the final.\nIn the spring of 1959, Lee got into another street fight, and the police were called.\nUntil his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared triad family. Eventually, Lee's father decided his son should leave Hong Kong to pursue a safer and healthier life in the United States. His parents confirmed the police's fear that this time Lee's opponent had an organized crime background and that there was the possibility that a contract was out for his life.\n\nIn April 1959, Lee's parents decided to send him to the United States to stay with his older sister, Agnes Lee (李秋鳳), who was already living with family friends in San Francisco.\n\nAt the age of 18, Lee returned to the United States. After living in San Francisco for several months, he moved to Seattle in 1959 to continue his high school education, where he also worked for Ruby Chow as a live-in waiter at her restaurant.\n\nChow's husband was a co-worker and friend of Lee's father. Lee's elder brother Peter Lee (李忠琛) would also join him in Seattle for a short stay before moving on to Minnesota to attend college. In December 1960, Lee completed his high school education and received his diploma from Edison Technical School (now Seattle Central Community College, located on Capitol Hill in Seattle).\n\nIn March 1961, Lee enrolled at the University of Washington and studied dramatic arts, philosophy, psychology, and various other subjects. Despite what Lee himself and many others have stated, Lee's official major was drama rather than philosophy according to a 1999 article in the university's alumni publication. He soon met his future wife Linda Emery, a fellow student studying to become a teacher, whom he married in August 1964.\n\nLee had two children with Linda Emery: Brandon Lee (1965–1993) and Shannon Lee (born 1969).\n\nLee began teaching martial arts in the United States in 1959. He called what he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu (literally Bruce Lee's Kung Fu). It was basically his approach to Wing Chun. Lee taught friends he met in Seattle, starting with Judo practitioner Jesse Glover, who continued to teach some of Lee's early techniques. Taky Kimura became Lee's first Assistant Instructor and continued to teach his art and philosophy after Lee's death. Lee opened his first martial arts school, named the Lee Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute, in Seattle.\n\nLee dropped out of college in the spring of 1964 and moved to Oakland to live with James Yimm Lee (嚴鏡海). James Lee was twenty years senior to Bruce Lee and a well-known Chinese martial artist in the area. Together, they founded the second Jun Fan martial arts studio in Oakland. James Lee was also responsible for introducing Bruce Lee to Ed Parker, an American martial artist and organizer of the Long Beach International Karate Championships where Bruce Lee was later \"discovered\" by Hollywood.\n\nAt the invitation of Ed Parker, Lee appeared in the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships and performed repetitions of two-finger push-ups (using the thumb and the index finger of one hand) with feet at approximately shoulder-width apart. In the same Long Beach event he also performed the \"One inch punch.\" Lee stood upright, his right foot forward with knees bent slightly, in front of a standing, stationary partner. Lee's right arm was partly extended and his right fist approximately away from the partner's chest. Without retracting his right arm, Lee then forcibly delivered the punch to his partner while largely maintaining his posture, sending the partner backwards and falling into a chair said to be placed behind the partner to prevent injury, though his partner's momentum soon caused him to fall to the floor. His volunteer was Bob Baker of Stockton, California. \"I told Bruce not to do this type of demonstration again\", Baker recalled. \"When he punched me that last time, I had to stay home from work because the pain in my chest was unbearable\".\n\nIt was at the 1964 championships that Lee first met Taekwondo master Jhoon Goo Rhee. The two developed a friendship – a relationship from which they benefited as martial artists. Rhee taught Lee the side kick in detail, and Lee taught Rhee the \"non-telegraphic\" punch.\nLee appeared at the 1967 Long Beach International Karate Championships and performed various demonstrations, including the famous \"unstoppable punch\" against USKA world Karate champion Vic Moore. Lee allegedly told Moore that he was going to throw a straight punch to the face, and all he had to do was to try to block it. Lee took several steps back and asked if Moore was ready. When Moore nodded in affirmation, Lee glided towards him until he was within striking range. He then threw a straight punch directly at Moore's face, and stopped before impact. In eight attempts, Moore failed to block any of the punches. However, Moore and grandmaster Steve Mohammed claim that Lee had first told Moore that he was going to throw a straight punch to the body, which Moore blocked. Lee attempted another punch, and Moore blocked it as well. The third punch, which Lee threw to Moore's face, did not come nearly within striking distance. Moore claims that Lee never successfully struck Moore but Moore was able to strike Lee after trying on his own. Moore further claims that Bruce Lee said he was the fastest American he's ever seen and that Lee's media crew repeatedly played the one punch towards Moore's face that did not come within striking range, allegedly in an attempt to preserve Lee's superstar image. However, when viewing the video of the demonstration, it is clear that Mohammed and especially Moore were erroneous in their claims.\n\nIn Oakland's Chinatown in 1964, Lee had a controversial private match with Wong Jack Man, a direct student of Ma Kin Fung, known for his mastery of Xingyiquan, Northern Shaolin, and T'ai chi ch'uan. According to Lee, the Chinese community issued an ultimatum to him to stop teaching non-Chinese people. When he refused to comply, he was challenged to a combat match with Wong. The arrangement was that if Lee lost, he would have to shut down his school, while if he won, he would be free to teach white people, or anyone else. Wong denied this, stating that he requested to fight Lee after Lee boasted during one of his demonstrations at a Chinatown theatre that he could beat anyone in San Francisco, and that Wong himself did not discriminate against Whites or other non-Chinese people. Lee commented, \"That paper had all the names of the sifu from Chinatown, but they don't scare me\".\n\nIndividuals known to have witnessed the match include Cadwell, James Lee (Bruce Lee's associate, no relation), and William Chen, a teacher of T'ai chi ch'uan. Wong and William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20–25 minutes. Wong claims that although he had originally expected a serious but polite bout, Lee aggressively attacked him with intent to kill. When Wong presented the traditional handshake, Lee appeared to accept the greeting, but instead, Lee immediately thrust his hand as a spear aimed at Wong's eyes. Forced to defend his life, Wong nonetheless refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could have earned him a prison sentence. The fight ended due to Lee's \"unusually winded\" condition, as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter. By contrast, according to Bruce Lee, Linda Lee Cadwell, and James Yimm Lee, the fight lasted a mere 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Lee. In Cadwell's account, \"The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said 'Do you give up?' and the man said he gave up\".\n\nA couple of weeks after the bout, Lee gave an interview claiming that he had defeated an unnamed challenger, which Wong says was an obvious reference to him. In response, Wong published his own account of the fight in the Chinese \"Pacific Weekly\", a Chinese-language newspaper in San Francisco, with an invitation to a public rematch if Lee was not satisfied with the account. Lee did not respond to the invitation despite his reputation for violently responding to every provocation, and there were no further public announcements by either, though Lee continued to teach white people.\n\nJeet Kune Do originated in 1967. After filming one season of \"The Green Hornet\", Lee found himself out of work and opened The Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute. The controversial match with Wong Jack Man influenced Lee's philosophy about martial arts. Lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential using his Wing Chun techniques. He took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalized to be practical in scenarios of chaotic street fighting. Lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on \"practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency\". He started to use different methods of training such as weight training for strength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility, and many others which he constantly adapted, including fencing and basic boxing techniques.\n\nLee emphasized what he called \"the style of no style\". This consisted of getting rid of the formalized approach which Lee claimed was indicative of traditional styles. Lee felt that even the system he now called Jun Fan Gung Fu was too restrictive, and it eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call \"Jeet Kune Do\" or the \"Way of the Intercepting Fist.\" It is a term he would later regret, because Jeet Kune Do implied specific parameters that styles connote, whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations.\n\nAt and weighing at the time, Lee was renowned for his physical fitness and vigor, achieved by using a dedicated fitness regimen to become as strong as possible. After his match with Wong Jack Man in 1965, Lee changed his approach toward martial arts training. Lee felt that many martial artists of his time did not spend enough time on physical conditioning. Lee included all elements of total fitness—muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility. He used traditional bodybuilding techniques to build some muscle mass, though not overdone, as that could decrease speed or flexibility. At the same time, with respect to balance, Lee maintained that mental and spiritual preparation are fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills. In \"Tao of Jeet Kune Do\" he wrote:\n\nAccording to Linda Lee Cadwell, soon after he moved to the United States, Lee started to take nutrition seriously and developed an interest in health foods, high-protein drinks, and vitamin and mineral supplements. He later concluded that achieving a high-performance body was akin to maintaining the engine of a high-performance automobile. Allegorically, as one could not keep a car running on low-octane fuels, one could not sustain one's body with a steady diet of junk food, and with \"the wrong fuel\", one's body would perform sluggishly or sloppily. Lee also avoided baked goods and refined flour, describing them as providing empty calories that did nothing for his body. He was known for being a fan of Asian cuisine for its variety, and often ate meals with a combination of vegetables, rice, and fish, and drank fresh milk.\n\nLee's father Lee Hoi-chuen was a famous Cantonese opera star. Because of this, Lee was introduced into films at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child. Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film \"Golden Gate Girl\". By the time he was 18, he had appeared in twenty films.\n\nWhile in the United States from 1959 to 1964, Lee abandoned thoughts of a film career in favour of pursuing martial arts. However, a martial arts exhibition on Long Beach in 1964 eventually led to the invitation by William Dozier for an audition for a role in the pilot for \"Number One Son\". The show never aired, but Lee was invited for the role of the sidekick Kato alongside the title character played by Van Williams in the TV series titled \"The Green Hornet\". The show lasted only one season of 26 episodes, from September 1966 to March 1967. Lee and Williams also appeared as their respective characters in three crossover episodes of \"Batman\", another William Dozier-produced television series. This was followed by guest appearances in three television series: \"Ironside\" (1967), \"Here Come the Brides\" (1969), and \"Blondie\" (1969).\n\nAt the time, two of Lee's martial arts students were Hollywood script writer Stirling Silliphant and actor James Coburn. In 1969 the three worked on a script for a film called \"The Silent Flute\", and went together on a location hunt to India. The project was not realised at the time, but the 1978 film \"Circle of Iron\", starring David Carradine, was based on the same plot. In 2010, producer Paul Maslansky was reported to have planned and received funding for a film based on the original script for \"The Silent Flute\". In 1969, Lee made a brief appearance in the Silliphant-penned film \"Marlowe\", where he played a henchman hired to intimidate private detective Philip Marlowe, (played by James Garner), by smashing up his office with leaping kicks and flashing punches, only to later accidentally jump off a tall building while trying to kick Marlowe off. The same year he also choreographed fight scenes for \"The Wrecking Crew\" starring Dean Martin, Sharon Tate, and featuring Chuck Norris in his first role. In 1970, he was responsible for fight choreography for \"A Walk in the Spring Rain\" starring Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn, again written by Silliphant. In 1971, Lee appeared in four episodes of the television series \"Longstreet\", written by Silliphant. Lee played the martial arts instructor of the title character Mike Longstreet (played by James Franciscus), and important aspects of his martial arts philosophy were written into the script.\nAccording to statements made by Lee, and also by Linda Lee Cadwell after Lee's death, in 1971 Lee pitched a television series of his own tentatively titled \"The Warrior\", discussions of which were also confirmed by Warner Bros. During a December 9, 1971 television interview on \"The Pierre Berton Show\", Lee stated that both Paramount and Warner Brothers wanted him \"to be in a modernized type of a thing, and that they think the Western idea is out, whereas I want to do the Western\". According to Cadwell, however, Lee's concept was retooled and renamed \"Kung Fu\", but Warner Bros. gave Lee no credit. Warner Brothers states that they had for some time been developing an identical concept, created by two writers and producers, Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander. According to these sources, the reason Lee was not cast was in part because of his ethnicity, but more so because he had a thick accent. The role of the Shaolin monk in the Wild West was eventually awarded to then-non-martial-artist David Carradine. In \"The Pierre Berton Show\" interview, Lee stated he understood Warner Brothers' attitudes towards casting in the series: \"They think that business-wise it is a risk. I don't blame them. If the situation were reversed, and an American star were to come to Hong Kong, and I was the man with the money, I would have my own concerns as to whether the acceptance would be there\".\n\nProducer Fred Weintraub had advised Lee to return to Hong Kong and make a feature film which he could showcase to executives in Hollywood. Not happy with his supporting roles in the US, Lee returned to Hong Kong. Unaware that \"The Green Hornet\" had been played to success in Hong Kong and was unofficially referred to as \"The Kato Show\", he was surprised to be recognized on the street as the star of the show. After negotiating with both Shaw Brothers Studio and Golden Harvest, Lee signed a film contract to star in two films produced by Golden Harvest.\n\nLee played his first leading role in \"The Big Boss\" (1971), which proved to be an enormous box office success across Asia and catapulted him to stardom. He soon followed up with \"Fist of Fury\" (1972), which broke the box office records set previously by \"The Big Boss\". Having finished his initial two-year contract, Lee negotiated a new deal with Golden Harvest. Lee later formed his own company, Concord Production Inc. (協和電影公司), with Chow. For his third film, \"Way of the Dragon\" (1972), he was given complete control of the film's production as the writer, director, star, and choreographer of the fight scenes. In 1964, at a demonstration in Long Beach, California, Lee had met karate champion Chuck Norris. In \"Way of the Dragon\" Lee introduced Norris to moviegoers as his opponent in the final death fight at the Colosseum in Rome, today considered one of Lee's most legendary fight scenes and one of the most memorable fight scenes in martial arts film history. The role had originally been offered to American karate champion Joe Lewis.\nFrom August to October 1972, Lee began work on his fourth Golden Harvest Film, \"Game of Death\". He began filming some scenes, including his fight sequence with American basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, a former student. Production stopped in November 1972 when Warner Brothers offered Lee the opportunity to star in \"Enter the Dragon\", the first film to be produced jointly by Concord, Golden Harvest, and Warner Bros. Filming began in Hong Kong in January 1973. One month into the filming, another production company, Starseas Motion Pictures, promoted Bruce Lee as a leading actor in \"Fist of Unicorn\", although he had merely agreed to choreograph the fight sequences in the film as a favour to his long-time friend Unicorn Chan. Lee planned to sue the production company, but retained his friendship with Chan. However, only a few months after the completion of \"Enter the Dragon\", and six days before its July 26, 1973 release, Lee died. \"Enter the Dragon\" would go on to become one of the year's highest-grossing films and cement Lee as a martial arts legend. It was made for US$850,000 in 1973 (equivalent to $4 million adjusted for inflation as of 2007). To date, \"Enter the Dragon\" has grossed over $200 million worldwide. The film sparked a brief fad in martial arts, epitomised in songs such as \"Kung Fu Fighting\" and TV shows like \"Kung Fu\".\n\nRobert Clouse, the director of \"Enter the Dragon\", together with Golden Harvest, revived Lee's unfinished film \"Game of Death\". Lee had shot over 100 minutes of footage, including out-takes, for \"Game of Death\" before shooting was stopped to allow him to work on \"Enter the Dragon\". In addition to Abdul-Jabbar, George Lazenby, Hapkido master Ji Han-Jae, and another of Lee's students, Dan Inosanto, were also to appear in the film, which was to culminate in Lee's character, Hai Tien (clad in the now-famous yellow track suit) taking on a series of different challengers on each floor as they make their way through a five-level pagoda. In a controversial move, Robert Clouse finished the film using a look-alike and archive footage of Lee from his other films with a new storyline and cast, which was released in 1978. However, the cobbled-together film contained only fifteen minutes of actual footage of Lee (he had printed many unsuccessful takes) while the rest had a Lee look-alike, Kim Tai Chung, and Yuen Biao as stunt double. The unused footage Lee had filmed was recovered 22 years later and included in the documentary \"\".\n\nApart from \"Game of Death\", other future film projects were planned to feature Lee at the time. In 1972, after the success of \"The Big Boss\" and \"Fist of Fury\", a third film was planned by Raymond Chow at Golden Harvest to be directed by Lo Wei, titled \"Yellow-Faced Tiger\". However, at the time, Lee decided to direct and produce his own script for \"Way of the Dragon\" instead. Although Lee had formed a production company with Raymond Chow, a period film was also planned from September–November 1973 with the competing Shaw Brothers Studio, to be directed by either Chor Yuen or Cheng Kang, and written by Yi Kang and Chang Cheh, titled \"The Seven Sons of the Jade Dragon\". Lee had also worked on several scripts himself. A tape containing a recording of Lee narrating the basic storyline to a film tentatively titled \"Southern Fist/Northern Leg\" exists, showing some similarities with the canned script for \"The Silent Flute\" (\"Circle of Iron\"). Another script had the title \"Green Bamboo Warrior\", set in San Francisco, planned to co-star Bolo Yeung and to be produced by Andrew Vajna who later went on to produce \"First Blood\". Photoshoot costume tests were also organized for some of these planned film projects.\n\nIn 2015, Perfect Storm Entertainment and Bruce Lee's daughter, Shannon Lee announced that the series \"The Warrior\" would be produced and would air on the Cinemax and the filmmaker Justin Lin was chosen to direct the series. Production began on October 22, 2017 in Cape Town, South Africa. The first season will contain 10 episodes.\n\nLee is best known as a martial artist, but he also studied drama and Asian and Western philosophy while a student at the University of Washington and throughout his life. He was well-read and had an extensive library dominated by martial arts subjects and philosophical texts. His own books on martial arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions, both inside and outside of martial arts circles. His eclectic philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to claim that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings. He believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self-knowledge, and said that his chosen method of self-expression was martial arts. His influences include Taoism, Jiddu Krishnamurti, and Buddhism. Lee's philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservative worldview advocated by Confucianism. John Little states that Lee was an atheist. When asked in 1972 about his religious affiliation, he replied, \"none whatsoever\", and when asked if he believed in God, he said, \"To be perfectly frank, I really do not.\"\n\nAside from martial arts and philosophy, which focus on the physical aspect and self-consciousness for truths and principles, Lee also wrote poetry that reflected his emotion and a stage in his life collectively. Many forms of art remain concordant with the artist creating them. Lee's principle of self-expression was applied to his poetry as well. His daughter Shannon Lee said, \"He did write poetry; he was really the consummate artist.\" His poetic works were originally handwritten on paper, then later on edited and published, with John Little being the major author (editor), for Bruce Lee's works. Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce Lee's wife) shared her husband's notes, poems, and experiences with followers. She mentioned \"Lee's poems are, by American standards, rather dark--reflecting the deeper, less exposed recesses of the human psyche\". Most of Bruce Lee's poems are categorized as anti-poetry or fall into a paradox. The mood in his poems shows the side of the man that can be compared with other poets such as Robert Frost, one of many well-known poets expressing himself with dark poetic works. The paradox taken from the Yin and Yang symbol in martial arts was also integrated into his poetry. His martial arts and philosophy contribute a great part to his poetry. The free verse form of Lee's poetry reflects his famous quote \"Be formless … shapeless, like water.\"\n\nOn May 10, 1973, Lee collapsed during an automated dialogue replacement session for \"Enter the Dragon\" at Golden Harvest in Hong Kong. Suffering from seizures and headaches, he was immediately rushed to Hong Kong Baptist Hospital, where doctors diagnosed cerebral edema. They were able to reduce the swelling through the administration of mannitol. The headache and cerebral edema that occurred in his first collapse were later repeated on the day of his death.\n\nOn July 20, 1973, Lee was in Hong Kong, to have dinner with actor George Lazenby, with whom he intended to make a film. According to Lee's wife Linda, Lee met producer Raymond Chow at 2 p.m. at home to discuss the making of the film \"Game of Death\". They worked until 4 p.m. and then drove together to the home of Lee's colleague Betty Ting Pei, a Taiwanese actress. The three went over the script at Ting's home, and then Chow left to attend a dinner meeting.\n\nLater, Lee complained of a headache, and Ting gave him an analgesic, Equagesic, which contained both aspirin and the tranquilizer meprobamate. Around 7:30 p.m., he went to lie down for a nap. When Lee did not come for dinner, producer Raymond Chow came to the apartment, but he was unable to wake Lee up. A doctor was summoned, and spent ten minutes attempting to revive Lee before sending him by ambulance to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Lee was declared dead on arrival, at the age of 32.\n\nThere was no visible external injury; however, according to autopsy reports, Lee's brain had swollen considerably, from 1,400 to 1,575 grams (a 13% increase). The autopsy found Equagesic in his system. On October 15, 2005, Chow stated in an interview that Lee died from an allergic reaction to the tranquilizer meprobamate, the main ingredient in Equagesic, which Chow described as an ingredient commonly used in painkillers. When the doctors announced Lee's death, it was officially ruled a \"death by misadventure\".\n\nLee's wife Linda returned to her hometown of Seattle, and had Lee's body buried in Lot 276 of Lake View Cemetery in Seattle. Pallbearers at Lee's funeral on July 25, 1973, included Taky Kimura, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Chuck Norris, George Lazenby, Dan Inosanto, Peter Chin, and Lee's brother Robert. Around the time of Lee's death, numerous rumors appeared in the media. Lee's iconic status and untimely death fed many wild rumors and theories. These included murder involving the triads and a supposed curse on him and his family.\n\nDonald Teare, a forensic scientist, recommended by Scotland Yard, who had overseen over 1,000 autopsies, was assigned to the Lee case. His conclusion was \"death by misadventure\" caused by an acute cerebral edema due to a reaction to compounds present in the combination medication Equagesic. Although there was initial speculation that cannabis found in Lee's stomach may have contributed to his death, Teare refuted this, stating that it would \"be both 'irresponsible and irrational' to say that [cannabis] might have triggered either the events of Bruce's collapse on May 10 or his death on July 20\". Dr. R. R. Lycette, the clinical pathologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, reported at the coroner hearing that the death could not have been caused by cannabis.\n\nAt the 1975 San Diego Comic-Con convention, Lee's friend Chuck Norris attributed his death to a reaction to the combination of the muscle-relaxant medication he had been taking since 1968 for a ruptured disc in his back and an \"antibiotic\" he was given for his headache on the night of his death. In a 2017 episode of the Reelz TV series \"\", forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Hunter theorized that Lee died of adrenal crisis brought on by the overuse of cortisone, which Lee had been taking since injuring his back in a 1970 weightlifting mishap. Dr. Hunter believes that Lee's exceptionally strong \"drive and ambition\" played a fundamental role in the martial artist's ultimate demise.\n\nIn a 2018 biography, author Matthew Polly consulted with medical experts and theorized that Lee died from cerebral edema caused by over-exertion and heat stroke; and heat stroke was not considered at the time because it was then a poorly-understood condition. Furthermore, Lee had had his underarm sweat glands removed in late 1972, in the apparent belief that underarm sweat was unphotogenic on film. Polly further theorized that this caused Lee's body to overheat while practicing in hot temperatures on May 10 and July 20, 1973, resulting in heat stroke that in turn exacerbated the cerebral edema that led to his death.\n\nBruce Lee personally certified only three instructors: Taky Kimura, James Yimm Lee, and Dan Inosanto. Taky Kimura holds a 5th rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu. James Yimm Lee held a 3rd rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu. Inosanto holds the 3rd rank (Instructor) directly from Bruce Lee in Jeet Kune Do, Jun Fan Gung Fu, and Bruce Lee's Tao of Chinese Gung Fu. Ted Wong holds 2nd rank in Jeet Kune Do certified directly by Bruce Lee and was later promoted to Instructor under Dan Inosanto, who felt that Bruce would have wanted to promote him. Other Jeet Kune Do instructors since Lee's death have been certified directly by Dan Inosanto, some with remaining Bruce Lee-signed certificates.\n\nJames Yimm Lee, a close friend of Lee, certified a few students including Gary Dill, who studied Jeet Kune Do under James and received permission via a personal letter from him in 1972 to pass on his learning of Jun Fan Gung Fu to others. Taky Kimura, to date, has certified only one person in Jun Fan Gung Fu: his son Andy Kimura. Dan Inosanto continued to teach and certify select students in Jeet Kune Do for over 30 years, making it possible for thousands of martial arts practitioners to trace their training lineage back to Bruce Lee. Prior to his death, Lee told his then only two living instructors Kimura and Inosanto (James Yimm Lee had died in 1972) to dismantle his schools. Both Taky Kimura and Dan Inosanto were allowed to teach small classes thereafter, under the guideline \"keep the numbers low, but the quality high\".\n\nBruce also instructed several World Karate Champions including Chuck Norris, Joe Lewis, and Mike Stone.

One is that his early 1970s interview on the TVB show \"Enjoy Yourself Tonight\" cleared the busy streets of Hong Kong as everyone was watching the interview at home.\n\nOn January 6, 2009, it was announced that Bruce's Hong Kong home (41 Cumberland Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong) will be preserved and transformed into a tourist site by philanthropist Yu Pang-lin.\n\nBruce Lee was named by \"Time\" magazine as one of the people of the 20th century. In April 2013, he was posthumously awarded the prestigious Founders Award at The Asian Awards. A Bruce Lee statue was unveiled in Los Angeles' Chinatown on June 15, 2013. It stands at tall and was made in Guangzhou, China. In April 2014, Lee was named a featured character in the video game \"EA Sports UFC\", and is playable in multiple weight classes.\n\nLee was trained in Wu Tai Chi Chuan (also known as Ng-ga) and Jing Mo Tam Tui for the twelve sets. Lee was trained in the martial arts Choy Li Fut, Western Boxing, Épée fencing, Judo, Praying Mantis kung fu, Hsing-I, and Jujitsu.\n\nThough Bruce Lee did not appear in commercials during his lifetime, Nokia launched an internet-based campaign in 2008 with staged \"documentary-looking\" footage of Bruce Lee playing ping-pong with his nunchaku and also igniting matches as they are thrown towards him. The videos went viral on YouTube, creating confusion as some people believed them to be authentic footage.\n\n\n\n\n"}

These \"in silico\" techniques are used, for example, in pharmaceutical companies and academic settings in the process of drug discovery. These methods can also be used in chemical and allied industries in various other forms.\n\nThe term chemoinformatics was defined by F.K. Brown in 1998:\nChemoinformatics is the mixing of those information resources to transform data into information and information into knowledge for the intended purpose of making better decisions faster in the area of drug lead identification and optimization.\nSince then, both spellings have been used, and some have evolved to be established as Cheminformatics, while European Academia settled in 2006 for Chemoinformatics. The recent establishment of the Journal of Cheminformatics is a strong push towards the shorter variant.\n\nCheminformatics combines the scientific working fields of chemistry, computer science and information science for example in the areas of topology, chemical graph theory, information retrieval and data mining in the chemical space. Cheminformatics can also be applied to data analysis for various industries like paper and pulp, dyes and such allied industries.\n\nThe primary application of cheminformatics is in the storage, indexing and search of information relating to compounds. The efficient search of such stored information includes topics that are dealt with in computer science as data mining, information retrieval, information extraction and machine learning. Related research topics include:\n\nThe \"in silico\" representation of chemical structures uses specialized formats such as the XML-based Chemical Markup Language or SMILES. These representations are often used for storage in large chemical databases. While some formats are suited for visual representations in 2 or 3 dimensions, others are more suited for studying physical interactions, modeling and docking studies.\n\nChemical data can pertain to real or virtual molecules. Virtual libraries of compounds\nmay be generated in various ways to explore chemical space and hypothesize novel \ncompounds with desired properties.\n\nVirtual libraries of classes of compounds (drugs, natural products, diversity-oriented synthetic products) were recently generated using the FOG (fragment optimized growth) algorithm. This was done by using cheminformatic tools to train transition probabilities of a Markov chain on authentic classes of compounds, and then using the Markov chain to generate novel compounds that were similar to the training database.\n\nIn contrast to high-throughput screening, virtual screening involves computationally\nscreening \"in silico\" libraries of compounds, by means of various methods such as\ndocking, to identify members likely to possess desired properties\nsuch as biological activity against a given target. In some cases, combinatorial chemistry is used in the development of the library to increase the efficiency in mining the chemical space. More commonly, a diverse library of small molecules or natural products is screened.\n\nThis is the calculation of quantitative structure–activity relationship and quantitative structure property relationship values, used to predict the activity of compounds from their structures. In this context there is also a strong relationship to chemometrics. Chemical expert systems are also relevant, since they represent parts of chemical knowledge as an \"in silico\" representation. There is a relatively new concept of matched molecular pair analysis or prediction-driven MMPA which is coupled with QSAR model in order to identify activity cliff.\n"}

{"id": "614877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=614877", "title": "Coffin birth", "text": "Coffin birth\n\nCoffin birth, also known as postmortem fetal extrusion, is the expulsion of a nonviable fetus through the vaginal opening of the decomposing body of a deceased pregnant woman as a result of the increasing pressure of intra-abdominal gases. This kind of postmortem delivery occurs very rarely during the decomposition of a body. The practice of chemical preservation, whereby chemical preservatives and disinfectant solutions are pumped into a body to replace natural body fluids (and the bacteria that reside therein), have made the occurrence of \"coffin birth\" so rare that the topic is rarely mentioned in international medical discourse.\n\nTypically during the decomposition of a human body, naturally occurring bacteria in the organs of the abdominal cavity (such as the stomach and intestines) generate gases as by-products of metabolism, which causes the body to swell. In some cases, the confined pressure of the gases can squeeze the uterus (the womb), even forcing it downward, and it may turn inside-out and be forced out of the body through the vaginal opening (a process called \"prolapse\"). If a fetus is contained within the uterus, it could therefore be expelled from the mother's body through the vaginal opening when the uterus turns inside-out, in a process that, to outward appearances, mimics childbirth. The main differences lie in the state of the mother and fetus and the mechanism of delivery: in the event of natural, live childbirth, the mother's contractions thin and shorten the cervix to expel the infant from the womb; in a case of coffin birth, built-up gas pressure within the putrefied body of a pregnant woman pushes the dead fetus from the body of the mother.\n\nCases have been recorded by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when the body of a pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated from the body of the pregnant woman about the time of death or during decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.\n\nThe cause of postmortem fetal extrusion is not completely understood, as the event is neither predictable nor replicable under experimental conditions. Evidence has accumulated opportunistically and direct observation is serendipitous. While it is possible that more than one cause can produce the same result, there is an accepted hypothesis, based on established research in the fields of biochemistry and forensic taphonomy, and further supported by observational research, that accounts for the taphonomic mechanisms that would result in the most often encountered cases of postmortem extrusion of a non-viable fetus.\n\nTypically, as a dead body decomposes, body tissues become depleted of oxygen and the body begins to putrefy; anaerobic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract proliferate and as a result of increased metabolic activity, release gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen sulfide. These bacteria secrete exoenzymes to break down body cells and proteins for ingestion which thus weakens organ tissues. Increasing pressure forces the diffusion of excessive gases into the weakened tissues where they enter the circulatory system and spread to other parts of the body, causing both torso and limbs to become bloated. These decompositional processes weaken the structural integrity of organs by separating necrotizing tissue layers. Bloating usually begins from two to five days after death, depending on external temperature, humidity, and other environmental conditions. As the volume of gas increases, the pressure begins to force various body fluids to exude from all natural orifices. It is at this point during the decomposition of a pregnant body that amniotic membranes become stretched and separated, and intra-abdominal gas pressure may force the eversion and prolapse of the uterus, which would result in the expulsion of the fetus through the vaginal canal. It has been observed that the bodies of multiparous women are more likely to spontaneously expel the fetus during decomposition than those who died during their first pregnancy, because of the more elastic nature of the cervix.\n\nNumerous documented cases of postmortem fetal extrusion were described in the medical compendium \"Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine\", first published in 1896. The earliest presented case occurred in 1551 when a pregnant woman was tried and hanged by the courts of the Spanish Inquisition. Four hours after her death, and while the body still hung by the neck, two dead infants were seen to fall free of the body. This is unusual for the short amount of time elapsed between death and the postmortem delivery. As no information is given regarding other ambient circumstances, it is unclear whether the onset of putrefaction was accelerated, or if other causal factors were at work. In the city of Brussels, in 1633, a woman died in convulsions and three days later a fetus was spontaneously expelled. In Weissenfels, in 1861, postmortem fetal extrusion was observed sixty hours after the death of a pregnant woman. Other cases are described, though only a few describe the unexpected discovery of fetal remains following exhumation. Most cases occurred before burial; in some of these, the body was in the casket while in other cases the body was still on its deathbed or on a bier.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, modern embalming techniques were developed, whereby preservative and disinfectant chemical compounds (such as formaldehyde) are pumped into a body, flushing out the body's natural fluids, and with them the bacteria that flourish during putrefaction and generate the gases that comprise the active force behind the expulsion of the fetus. However, the phenomenon was still recognized by medical science and in 1904, John Whitridge Williams wrote a textbook on obstetric medicine that included a section on \"coffin birth\". Although the text has remained an important reference in obstetrics, the subject, whether called \"coffin birth\" or \"postmortem fetal extrusion\", was excluded by its 13th edition in 1966, and was not mentioned in the edition published in 2009. The subject was discussed in German medical literature during the 20th century, though more detailed case reports in the forensic literature have been published recently.\n\nIn 2005, the body of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was discovered in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, it was found that the head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head and shoulders of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as it was the first modern case in which medical practitioners were able to document a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress.\nIn 2008, the body of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was discovered in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman's undergarments. Although the fetus was in a similar state of decomposition, the umbilical cord was intact and still attached to the placenta inside the uterus. This was the first forensic case in which it could be concluded that coffin birth had occurred based on the position of the bodies and the clear attachment of the umbilical cord to the un-expelled placenta.\n\nPostmortem fetal extrusion can be very difficult to recognize once a body has undergone complete skeletonization, and bioarchaeologists are often very cautious about asserting the presence of this phenomenon. There are numerous cultural reasons why a mother and an infant might be interred together, so the joint presence of neonatal remains and an adult female is not taken as conclusive evidence of postmortem fetal extrusion; however, there have been excavated burials where the position of a set of fetal remains relative to those of an adult female supported this hypothesis. There are a few general guidelines when an archaeologist is assessing the placement of the fetus and the adult:\n\nIn 1975, it was reported that during the excavation of a medieval cemetery in Kings Worthy, England, fetal remains appeared to lie within the birth canal of the skeleton of a young woman, with the fetal cranium external to the pelvic outlet and between the two femora (thigh bones) and the fetal leg bones clearly within the pelvic cavity. Other cases of coffin birth at archaeological sites have been described, such as in 1978 at a Neolithic site in Germany, at a medieval site in Denmark in 1982, and in 2009 at an Early Christian period site at Fingal, Ireland. A coffin birth was also described in a 2011 episode of the BBC show \"History Cold Case\", featuring the Roman era remains of a woman and three neonates discovered near Baldock, Hertfordshire. Another was identified in 2006 in a 14th-century Black Death cemetery in Genoa, Italy.\n\nBecause postmortem fetal extrusion is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions regarding the individual and the ambient environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem fetal extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods, experimental research would be highly problematic. At present, forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.\n\nIn archaeology, the study of mortuary context, that is, the interpretation of the postmortem treatment of the dead, whether an individual or as pertains to patterns within a group, has led to the development of hypotheses on social status and/or hierarchy regarding many cultures, ancient and extant. In addition, the determination of whether or not delivery actually occurred before death has a bearing on analyses of the mother's population, as the concentration of trace elements differ markedly between the skeletons of prepartum adult women (before giving birth) and women who are lactating; the identification of coffin birth would lead to more accurate analyses of the number of lactating women in a population or the rate of maternal mortality. It is therefore necessary for investigators to be able to recognize postmortem fetal extrusion when encountered in an excavated burial.\n\nThere are also many cases where the remains of the fetus are found separate from the body of the mother, but expulsion was not through the birth canal, and separation of the two bodies may have been influenced by external environmental factors. The process of separation is so unusual that a specific term for the phenomenon may not have been proposed to the scientific community. These cases may have comparable results, but they are not cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.\n\nIn April 2003, the body of Laci Peterson washed up on a shore near San Francisco Bay; she had been pregnant when she disappeared four months earlier, and the fetus she had been carrying was discovered on a separate beach. When questioned by the media, medical authorities initially speculated that a \"coffin birth\" might have occurred. However, at autopsy the cervix was found to be in a prepartum condition. Medical examiners later concluded that while Peterson's body was in the bay, the skin over the abdominal cavity had ruptured due to natural decompositional processes. Seawater entered the abdominal cavity and washed out most of the internal organs, along with the fetus.\n\nIn 2007, a 23-year-old woman in India, over eight months pregnant, hanged herself after contractions had begun. A viable infant was spontaneously delivered unassisted from the woman's body, which was suspended by the neck. The healthy infant was found on the floor, still tethered to the body of the mother by the umbilical cord. The primary cause of the delivery was the otherwise normal contractions, which had begun before death, and was therefore not related to processes of decomposition. While this is not postmortem fetal extrusion, it may be referred to as a case of \"postmortem delivery\", a term which is applied to a broad range of techniques and phenomena with a resultant delivery of a live infant.\n\nIn 2008, in Germany, a 23-year-old woman in her third trimester was involved in a motor vehicle accident, and died; the non-viable fetus was found between her feet. The vehicle caught fire following initial impact . The woman was unable to escape due to internal injuries and burned to death. Investigators came to the conclusion that the extreme heat of the fire burned away epidermal and subcutaneous tissue around the abdominal cavity, after which the anterior aspect of the uterus ruptured, causing the fetus to spill out of the uterine cavity and land on the floor between the woman's feet. The umbilical cord was still intact and connected the fetus to the placenta through the ruptured wall of the uterus. Unlike the woman, who suffered fourth-degree burns over her entire body, the body of the fetus was relatively undamaged. Because the primary cause of separation from the mother's body was thermally induced traumatic rupture of the abdominal and uterine cavities; traumatic separation was not related to normal decompositional processes; and expulsion of the fetus did not involve passage through the birth canal, this is not considered a case of postmortem fetal extrusion.\n\nWhales can be subject to postmortem fetal extrusion. Many species float when dead, due to the gases of putrefaction. Drift whales that wash up on shore, and the carcasses of hunted whales, if not flensed (stripped of blubber) and processed in a timely manner, posed a risk. Tim Flannery wrote that \"A rotting whale could fill with gas to bursting, ejecting a fetus the size of a motor vehicle with sufficient force to kill a man.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2671343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2671343", "title": "Criticism of religion", "text": "Criticism of religion\n\nCriticism of religion is criticism of the ideas, the truth, or the practice of religion, including its political and social implications.\n\nHistorical records of criticism of religion goes back to at least 5th century BCE in ancient Greece, with Diagoras \"the Atheist\" of Melos. In ancient Rome, an early known example is Lucretius' \"De Rerum Natura\" from the 1st century BCE.\n\nEvery exclusive religion on Earth that promotes exclusive truth claims necessarily denigrates the truth claims of other religions. Critics of religion in general often regard religion as outdated, harmful to the individual, harmful to society, an impediment to the progress of science, a source of immoral acts or customs and a political tool for social control.\n\nIn his work \"De Rerum Natura\", the 1st century BCE Roman poet Titus Lucretius Carus wrote: \"But 'tis that same religion oftener far / Hath bred the foul impieties of men\". A philosopher of the Epicurean school, Lucretius, believed the world was composed solely of matter and void and that all phenomena could be understood as resulting from purely natural causes. Despite believing in Gods, Lucretius, like Epicurus, felt that religion was born of fear and ignorance, and that understanding the natural world would free people of its shackles. He was not against religion in and of itself, but against traditional religion which he saw as superstition for teaching that gods interfered with the world.\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, Niccolò Machiavelli said: \"We Italians are irreligious and corrupt above others... because the church and her representatives have set us the worst example\". To Machiavelli, religion was merely a tool, useful for a ruler wishing to manipulate public opinion.\n\nIn the 18th century, Voltaire was a deist and was strongly critical of religious intolerance. Voltaire complained about Jews killed by other Jews for worshiping a golden calf and similar actions, he also condemned how Christians killed other Christians over religious differences and how Christians killed Native Americans for not being baptised. Voltaire claimed the real reason for these killings was that Christians wanted to plunder the wealth of those killed. Voltaire was also critical of Muslim intolerance.\n\nAlso in the 18th century, David Hume criticised teleological arguments for religion. Hume claimed that natural explanations for the order in the universe were reasonable, see design argument. An important aim of Hume's writings was demonstrating the unsoundness of the philosophical basis for religion.\nIn the early 21st century, the New Atheists became focal polemicists in modern criticism of religion. The four authors come from widely different backgrounds and have published books which have been the focus of criticism of religion narratives, with over 100 books and hundreds of scholarly articles commenting on and critiquing the four Horsemen's works. Their books and articles have spawned debate in multiple fields of inquiry and are heavily quoted in popular media (online forums, YouTube, television and popular philosophy). In \"The End of Faith\", philosopher Sam Harris focuses on violence among other toxic qualities of religion. In \"\", philosopher Daniel Dennett focuses on the question of \"why we believe strange things\". In \"The God Delusion\", biologist Richard Dawkins covers almost every facet of religion injecting both snarky irony and humor. In \"God Is Not Great\", journalist and polemicist Christopher Hitchens focused on how religious forces attacks human dignity and the corruption of religious organizations. In the \"Oxford Handbook of Atheism\", according to Thomas Zenc the four books were published during a time of intense debate on political, religious and sociological questions. The works share many common themes yet notably differ in scope, style and content. While according to Zenc the beginnings of a broader narrative (New Atheism) seems to have emerged it does not, stand up to the full definition of a movement.\n\nToday, religion is broadly conceived as an abstraction which entails beliefs, doctrines and sacred places—even though the ancient and medieval cultures that produced religious texts, like the Bible or the Quran, did not have such conceptions or ideas in their languages, cultures, or histories. However, there is still no scholarly consensus over what a religion is.\n\nBefore the 17th century religion was conflated with every day life. Religion as a modern Western concept developed from the 17th century onwards. For example, in Asia, no one before the 19th century self-identified as a \"Hindu\" or other similar identities.\n\nWith the existence of diverse modern categories of religion such as monotheism, polytheism, pantheism, nontheism and diverse specific religions such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Taoism, Buddhism and many others, it is not always clear to whom the criticisms are aimed at or to what extent they are applicable to other religions.\n\nSome criticisms of monotheistic religions have been:\n\nDennett and Harris have asserted that theist religions and their scriptures are not divinely inspired, but man made to fulfill social, biological and political needs. Dawkins balances the benefits of religious beliefs (mental solace, community building and promotion of virtuous behavior) against the drawbacks. Such criticisms treat religion as a social construct and thus just another human ideology.\n\nDavid Hume argued that religion developed as a source of comfort in the face of the adversity, not as an honest grappling with verifiable truth. Religion is therefore an unsophisticated form of reasoning.\n\nDaniel Dennett has argued that, with the exception of more modern religions such as Raëlism, Mormonism, Scientology and the Bahá'í Faith, most religions were formulated at a time when the origin of life, the workings of the body, and the nature of the stars and planets were poorly understood. These narratives were intended to give solace and a sense of relationship with larger forces. As such, they may have served several important functions in ancient societies. Examples include the views many religions traditionally had towards solar and lunar eclipses and the appearance of comets (forms of astrology). Given current understanding of the physical world, where human knowledge has increased dramatically, Dawkins and French atheist philosopher Michel Onfray contend that continuing to hold on to these belief systems is irrational and no longer useful.\n\nAccording to Karl Marx, the father of \"scientific socialism\", religion is a tool used by the ruling classes whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It is in the interest of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness. Therefore, as long as the public believes in religion, they will not attempt to make any genuine effort to understand and overcome the real source of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their capitalist economic system. In this perspective, Marx saw religion as escapism.\n\nMarx also viewed the Christian doctrine of original sin as being deeply anti-social in character. Original sin, he argued, convinces people that the source of their misery lies in the inherent and unchangeable \"sinfulness\" of humanity rather than in the forms of social organization and institutions, which Marx argued can be changed through the application of collective social planning.\n\nIn his 1976 book \"The Selfish Gene\", Richard Dawkins coined the term memes to describe informational units that can be transmitted culturally, analogous to genes. He later used this concept in the essay \"Viruses of the Mind\" to explain the persistence of religious ideas in human culture.\n\nBoth the religious and non religious are critical of Dawkin's meme theory which has mostly been abandoned. John Bowker criticized the idea that \"God\" and \"Faith\" are viruses of the mind, suggesting that Dawkins' \"account of religious motivation [...] is [...] far removed from evidence and data\" that it is unreasonable to extract certain behaviours solely through religious memes. Alister McGrath has responded by arguing that \"memes have no place in serious scientific reflection\", that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions, that \"evolution\" of ideas is more Lamarckian than Darwinian and that there is no evidence (and certainly none in the essay) that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas. McGrath also points out that it is surveys in the United States report a high life satisfaction rate among the religious is not comparable with a virus.\n\nSam Harris compares religion to mental illness, saying it \"allows otherwise normal human beings to reap the fruits of madness and consider them \"holy\"\". According to a retrospective study on Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ, and the Apostle Paul, they may have had psychotic disorders that contributed inspiration for their revelations. They conclude that people with such disorders have had a monumental influence on civilization.\n\nPsychological studies into the phenomenon of mysticism link disturbing aspects of certain mystics' experiences to childhood abuse. Clifford A. Pickover found evidence suggesting that temporal lobe epilepsy may be linked to a variety of so-called spiritual or \"other worldly\" experiences, such as spiritual possession, originating from altered electrical activity in the brain. Carl Sagan, in his last book \"The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark\", presented his case for the miraculous sightings of religious figures and modern sightings of UFOs coming from the same mental disorder. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran suggests \"It's possible that many great religious leaders had temporal lobe seizures and this predisposes them to having visions, having mystical experiences\". Michael Persinger stimulated the temporal lobes of the brain artificially with a magnetic field using a device nicknamed the \"God helmet\" and was able to artificially induce religious experiences along with near-death experiences and ghost sightings. According to John Bradshaw \"Some forms of temporal lobe tumours or epilepsy are associated with extreme religiosity.\" In his research recent brain imaging of religious subjects praying or meditating show identical activity in the respective human section of the brain which Ramachandran calls God-spots.\n\nPsilocybin from mushrooms affect regions of the brain includingthe serotonergic system, which generating a sense of strong religious meaning, unity and ecstasy. Certain physical rituals may generate similar feelings.\n\nIn Michael Shermer's book \"Why People Believe Strange Things\" he theorizes on how emerging mankind imposed made-up explanations and bizarre rituals for natural phenomena they didn't and couldn't understand. This is similar to the arguments made by Daniel Dennett in \"\" however Shermer's argument goes further in that the peculiar and at times frightening rituals of religion are but one of many forms of strange customs that survive to this day.\n\nPhilosopher Auguste Comte posited that many societal constructs pass through three stages and that religion corresponds to the two earlier, or more primitive stages by stating: \"From the study of the development of human intelligence, in all directions, and through all times, the discovery arises of a great fundamental law, to which it is necessarily subject, and which has a solid foundation of proof, both in the facts of our organization and in our historical experience. The law is this: that each of our leading conceptions – each branch of our knowledge – passes successively through three different theoretical conditions: the theological, or fictitious; the metaphysical, or abstract; and the scientific, or positive\".\n\nIn his book \"Is Religion Dangerous?\", Keith Ward notes that not all false opinions are delusions and that belief in God is different as many great minds and people who live ordinary lives and believe in God are not irrational people. Hyperreligiosity or even \"intensely professed atheism\" can emerge from emotional disturbances involving temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nSome have criticized the effects of adherence to dangerous practices such as self-sacrifice.\n\nA detailed study in 1998 found 140 instances of deaths of children due to religion-based medical neglect. Most of these cases involved Christian parents relying on prayer to cure the child's disease and withholding medical care.\n\nJerusalem has loaned its name to a unique psychological phenomenon where Jewish or Christian individuals who develop obsessive religious themed ideas or delusions (sometimes believing themselves to be Jesus Christ or another prophet) will feel compelled to travel to Jerusalem.\n\nDuring a period of 13 years (1980–1993) for which admissions to the Kfar Shaul Mental Health Centre in Jerusalem were analyzed, it was reported that 1,200 tourists with severe, Jerusalem-themed mental problems, were referred to this clinic. Of these, 470 were admitted to hospital. On average, 100 such tourists have been seen annually, 40 of them requiring admission to hospital. About 2 million tourists visit Jerusalem each year. Kalian and Witztum note that as a proportion of the total numbers of tourists visiting the city, this is not significantly different from any other city. The statements of these claims has however been disputed, with the arguments that experiencers of the Jerusalem syndrome already were mentally ill.\n\nHonor killings once well known in the Western are now extremely rare however they still occur in other parts of the world. An honor is when a person is killed by family for bringing dishonor or shame upon the family.\n\nStoning is a form of capital punishment whereby a group throws stones at a person until death ensues. As of September 2010, stoning is a punishment that is included in the laws in some countries including Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and some states in Nigeria as punishment for zina al-mohsena (\"adultery of married persons\"). While stoning may not be codified in the laws of Afghanistan and Somalia, both countries have seen several incidents of stoning to death.\n\nUntil the early 2000s, stoning was a legal form of capital punishment in Iran. In 2002, the Iranian judiciary officially placed a moratorium on stoning. In 2005, judiciary spokesman Jamal Karimirad stated that \"in the Islamic republic, we do not see such punishments being carried out\", further adding that if stoning sentences were passed by lower courts, they were overruled by higher courts and \"no such verdicts have been carried out\". In 2008, the judiciary decided to fully scrap the punishment from the books in legislation submitted to parliament for approval. In early 2013, Iranian parliament published official report about excluding stoning from penal code and it accused Western media for spreading \"noisy propaganda\" about the case.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, female genital mutilation has no health benefits and is a violation of basic human rights. Though no first tier religious texts prescribe the practice, some practitioners do believe there is religious support for it. While it is mostly found in Muslim countries it is also practiced by some Christian and Animist countries mostly in Africa. GFA is not widely practiced in some Muslim countries making it difficult to separate religion from culture. Some religious leaders promote it, some consider it irrelevant to religion, and others contribute to its elimination\". The practice is illegal in all Western countries and it is also illegal to transport a girl to another country to carry out FGM. Multiple parents have been charged for committing this crime in the United Kingdom with those charged being exclusively from Muslim countries.\n\nMale circumcision is a cost effective way for disease prevention and helps reduce medical costs overall. The health benefits of male circumcision exceed the health risks by at least 100 to 1 and there are no long-term adverse effect in terms of sexual function or pleasure. As such, some have argued that failure to circumcise a baby boy may be unethical because it diminishes his right to good health.\n\nA metareview of 850 research papers on Religion in the United States concluded that \"the majority of well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being (life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect and higher morale and with lower rates of depression, suicidal thoughts and behavior and drug/alcohol use/abuse\". In addition, various surveys done by major opinion poll organizations in the United States including Gallup, a review of 200 papers, a meta analysis of 35 surveys another review of 498 papers and the handbook of religion. Surveys suggest a strong link between faith and altruism. and a meta analysis of 34 recent studies showing that membership of religious groups in the United States was positively correlated with membership of voluntary organizations, higher level of commitment, better self-esteem, are twice as likely to have a more satisfying sex life and lower risk of suicide, higher levels self-esteem, self-actualization and life satisfaction.\n\nA cross-national investigation on subjective well-being has noted that, globally, religious people are usually happier than nonreligious people, though nonreligious people also reach high levels of happiness.\n\nIt should be noted almost all of these studies were conducted within the United States and deal with subjectively reported life happiness. There is no significant correlation between religiosity and individual happiness in Denmark and the Netherlands, countries that have lower rates of religion, lower discrimination against atheists and where both the religious and non-religious are normative. The 2013 World Happiness Report mentions that once crude factors are taken into account, there are no differences in life satisfaction between religious and less religious countries.\n\nDespite honor killings occurring in multiple cultures and religions Islam is frequently blamed for their institution and persistence. Professor Tahira Shaid Khan notes that there is nothing in the Qur'an that permits or sanctions honor killings. attributes it to broader attitudes that view women as property with no rights as the explanation for honor killings. Khan also argues that this view results in violence against women and their being turned \"into a commodity which can be exchanged, bought and sold\".\n\nSome aspects of religion are criticized on the basis that they damage society as a whole. Steven Weinberg, for example, states it takes religion to make good people do evil. Bertrand Russell and Richard Dawkins cite religiously inspired or justified violence, resistance to social change, attacks on science, repression of women and homophobia.\n\nHartung has claimed that major religious moral codes can lead to \"us vs. them\" group solidarity and mentality which can dehumanise or demonise individuals outside their group as \"not fully human\", or less worthy. Results can vary from mild discrimination to outright genocide. A poll by \"The Guardian\" noted that 82% of the British people believe that religion is socially divisive and that this effect is harmful despite the observation that non-believers outnumber believers 2 to 1.\n\nAccording to one study, membership of a religious group can accentuate biases in behavior toward in group versus out group members, which may explain the lower number of interracial friends and greater approval of torture among church members.\n\nWhile terrorism is a complex subject it is argued that terrorists are partially reassured by their religious views of God's support and reward for their actions.\n\nThese conflicts are among the most difficult to resolve, particularly where both sides believe that God is on their side and has endorsed the moral righteousness of their claims. One of the most infamous quotes associated with religious fanaticism was made in 1209 during the siege of Béziers, a Crusader asked the Papal Legate Arnaud Amalric how to tell Catholics from Cathars when the city was taken, to which Amalric replied:\"Tuez-les tous; Dieu reconnaitra les siens\", or \"Kill them all; God will recognize his own\".\n\nTheoretical physicist Michio Kaku considers religious terrorism as one of the main threats in humanity's evolution from a Type 0 to Type 1 civilization.\n\nJohn William Draper and Andrew Dickson White, authors of the conflict thesis, have argued that when a religion offers a complete set of answers to the problems of purpose, morality, origins, or science, it often discourages exploration of those areas by suppressing curiosity, denies its followers a broader perspective and can prevent social, moral and scientific progress. Examples cited in their writings include the trial of Galileo and Giordano Bruno's execution.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the conflict thesis developed. According to this model, any interaction between religion and science must inevitably lead to open hostility, with religion usually taking the part of the aggressor against new scientific ideas. The historical conflict thesis was a popular historiographical approach in the history of science during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but its original form is almost entirely discarded by scholars today. Despite that, conflict theory remains a popular view among the general public and has been publicized by the success of books such as \"The God Delusion\".\n\nHistorians of science including John Hedley Brooke and Ronald Numbers consider the \"religion vs. science\" concept an oversimplification, and prefer to take a more nuanced view of the subject. These historians cite, for example, the Galileo affair and the Scopes trial; and assert that these were not purely instances of conflict between science and religion as personal and political factors also weighed heavily in the development of each. In addition, some historians contend that religious organizations figure prominently in the broader histories of many sciences, with many of the scientific minds until the professionalization of scientific enterprise (in the 19th century) being clergy and other religious thinkers. Some historians contend that many scientific developments such as Kepler's laws and the 19th century reformulation of physics in terms of energy were explicitly driven by religious ideas.\n\nRecent examples of tensions have been the creation-evolution controversy, controversies over the use of birth control, opposition to research into embryonic stem cells, or theological objections to vaccination, anesthesia and blood transfusion.\n\nSome studies show some positive links in the relationship between religiosity and moral behavior and altruism. Some studies have shown similar correlations between religiosity and giving.\n\nSome argue that religious violence confuses religious moral rules and behaviour with non-religious factors. This includes the claim that events like terrorist bombings are more politically motivated than religious. Mark Juergensmeyer argues that religion \"does not ordinarily lead to violence. That happens only with the coalescence of a peculiar set of circumstances—political, social, and ideological—when religion becomes fused with violent expressions of social aspirations, personal pride, and movements for political change\". and that it is unreasonable to attempt to differentiate \"religious violence\" and \"secular violence\" as separate categories. While others assert religion is not inherently violent and while the two are compatible they are not essential and that religious violence can be compared with non-religious violence.\n\nC. S. Lewis suggests that all religions by definition involve faith, or a belief in concepts that cannot be proven or disproven by the sciences. Not all religious people subscribe to the idea that religion and science are mutually exclusive (non-overlapping magisteria) as do some atheists including Stephen Jay Gould . Biologist Richard Dawkins has said that religious practitioners often do not believe in the view of non-overlapping magisteria.\n\nAccording to a survey most religious groups in the United States have no general epistemological conflict with science or with the seeking out of scientific knowledge even if there are epistemic or moral conflicts with their faith. Strict creationists tend to have very favorable views on many of the different sciences. A study on a national sample of United States college students found that the majority of undergraduates in both the natural and social sciences do not see conflict between science and religion. Cross-national studies polled from 1981–2001 on views of science and religion have noted that countries with higher religiosity have stronger trust in science.\n\nRichard Dawkins contends that theistic religions devalue human compassion and morality. In his view, the Bible contains many injunctions against following one's conscience over scripture and positive actions are supposed to originate not from compassion, but from the fear of punishment. Albert Einstein stated that no religious basis is needed in order to display ethical behavior.\n\nSurvey research suggests that believers do tend to hold different views than non-believers on a variety of social, ethical and moral questions. According to a 2003 survey conducted in the United States by The Barna Group, those who described themselves as believers were less likely than those describing themselves as atheists or agnostics to consider the following behaviors morally acceptable: cohabitating with someone of the opposite sex outside of marriage, enjoying sexual fantasies, having an abortion, sexual relationships outside of marriage, gambling, consuming marijuana, looking at pictures of nudity or explicit sexual behavior, getting drunk and \"having a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex\".\n\nIn the 19th century, philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer argued that teaching some ideas to children at a young age could foster resistance to doubting those ideas later on.\n\nIslam has permitted the child marriage of older men to girls as young as 9 years of age. Baptist pastor Jerry Vines denounced Mohammed as a pedophile for marying and having had sex with a nine-year-old, referring to Muhammad as a \"demon-possessed paedophile\".\n\nFor example, one organisation cites the case of a 10-year-old girl who was forced to marry and was raped in Yemen (Nujood Ali), a 13-year-old Yemeni girl dying of internal bleeding three days after marriage and a 12-year-old girl dying in childbirth after marriage. Yemen currently does not have a minimum age for marriage.\n\nLatter Day Saint church founder Joseph Smith married girls as young as 13 and 14 and other Latter Day Saints married girls as young as 10. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints eliminated underaged marriages in the 19th century, but several branches of Mormonism continue the practice.\n\nHomosexuality is unambiguously condemned in Abrahamic religions where prohibition and execution of those who engage in male homosexual activity are found in the Old testament of the bible and in the Koran. Homosexuals are also condemned in the New Testament several times but without obligatory punishment. In the United States, conservative Christian right groups such as the Christian Legal Society and the Alliance Defense Fund have filed numerous lawsuits against public universities, aimed at overturning policies that protect homosexuals from discrimination and hate speech. These groups argue that such policies infringe their right to freely exercise religion as guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\nMost secularised Christian countries have legalised homosexual activity and several have legalised same-sex marriage. However, not all historically Christian countries have done so such as Russia and Uganda which have introduces discriminatory laws ranging from anti-propaganda laws to corporal punishment. Homosexuality is still illegal in most Muslim countries and several of these countries impose the death penalty for homosexual behavior. In July 2005, two Iranian men aged sixteen and eighteen were, supposedly, hanged for homosexuality, causing an international outcry.\nThey were executed after being convicted by the court of having raped a 13-year-old boy. The case attracted international media attention. The British lesbian, gay and bisexual group OutRage!, alleged that the teenagers were executed for consensual homosexual acts and not rape.\n\nIn line with other findings suggesting that religious humanitarianism is largely directed at in-group members, greater religious identification, greater extrinsic religiosity and greater religious fundamentalism were associated with racial prejudice. This is congruent with the fact that 50% of religious congregations in the US are racially segregated, and only 12% have a degree of diversity.\n\nReligion has been used by some as justification for advocating racism. The Christian Identity movement has been associated with racism. However, there are arguments that these positions may be as much reflections of contemporary social views as of what has been called scientific racism.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had excluded African Americans from the priesthood from 1860 to 1978. Most fundamentalist Mormon sects within the Latter Day Saint movement, rejected the Church's 1978 decision to allow African Americans to hold the priesthood and continue to deny activity in the church due to race. Due to these beliefs, in its Spring 2005 \"Intelligence Report\" the Southern Poverty Law Center added the Church to its \"hate group\" listing because of the church's teachings on race, which include a strong condemnation of interracial relationships.\n\nThe content of the holy books of Abrahamic religions contain severe restrictions on the rights of women ranging from prohibiting women from certain behaviour and activities to requiring women to submit to the will of their father and or husband.\n\nAccording to Polly Toynbee, religion interferes with bodily autonomy for both genders and fosters particularly negative attitudes towards women's bodies. Toynbee writes: \"Women's bodies are always the issue - too unclean to be bishops, and dangerous enough to be covered up by Islam and mikvahed by Judaism\".\n\nIt is argued that religious sexual discrimination leads to unequal relations in marriage, creating norms which subordinate the wife to the husband. The word (\"ba`al\"), Hebrew for \"husband\", used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with \"owner\" and \"master\". This mirrors the abrahamic view of God as an omnipotent, perfect power, where this power is one of domination, which is persistently associated with the characteristics of ideal masculinity. Sheila Jeffreys argues: \"Religion gives authority to traditional, patriarchal beliefs about the essentially subordinate nature of women and their naturally separate roles, such as the need for women to be confined to the private world of the home and family, that women should be obedient to their husbands, that women's sexuality should be modest and under the control of their menfolk, and that women should not use contraception or abortion to limit their childbearing. The practice of such ancient beliefs interferes profoundly with women's abilities to exercise their human rights\".\n\nFeminist Julie Bindel argues that religions encourage the domination of men over women and that Islam promotes the submission of women to their husbands and encourages practices such as child marriage. She wrote that religion \"promotes inequality between men and women\", that Islam's message for a woman includes that \"she will be subservient to her husband and devote her life to pleasing him\" and that \"Islam's obsession with virginity and childbirth has led to gender segregation and early marriage.\n\nIslamic laws have been criticized by human rights organizations for exposing women to mistreatment and violence, preventing women from reporting rape and contributing to the discrimination of women. The United Nations say that Islam is used to justify unnecessary and harmful female genital mutilation, when the purposes range from deprivation of sexual satisfaction to discourage adultery, insuring virginity to their husbands, or generating appearance of virginity. Maryam Namazie argues that women are victimized under Sharia law, both in criminal matters (such as punishment for improper veiling) and in civil matters; and also that women have judicial hurdles that are lenient or advantageous for men.\n\nAccording to Phyllis Chesler, Islam is connected to violence against women, especially in the form of honor killings. She rejects the argument that honor killings are not related to Islam and claims that while fundamentalists of all religions place restrictions on women, in Islam not only are these restrictions harsher, but Islam also reacts more violently when these rules are broken.\n\nChristianity has been criticized for painting women as sinful, untrustful, deceiving and desiring to seduce and incite men into sexual sin. Katharine M. Rogers argues that Christianity is misogynistic and that the \"dread of female seduction\" can be found in St. Paul's epistles. K. K. Ruthven argues that the \"legacy of Christian misogyny was consolidated by the so-called 'Fathers' of the Church, like Tertullian, who thought a woman was not only 'the gateway of the devil' but also 'a temple built over a sewer'\". Jack Holland argues the concept of fall of man is misogynistic as \"a myth that blames woman for the ills and sufferings of mankind\".\n\nChristian religious figures have been involved in the Middle Ages and early modern period witch trials, which were generally used to punish assertive or independent women such as midwives since witchcraft was often not in evidence, or activists.\n\nKosher slaughter has historically attracted criticism from non-Jews as allegedly being inhumane and unsanitary, in part as an antisemitic canard that eating ritually slaughtered meat caused degeneration and in part out of economic motivation to remove Jews from the meat industry. Sometimes these criticisms were directed at Judaism as a religion. In 1893, animal advocates campaigning against kosher slaughter in Aberdeen attempted to link cruelty with Jewish religious practice. In the 1920s, Polish critics of kosher slaughter claimed that the practice actually had no basis in Scripture. In contrast, Jewish authorities argue that the slaughter methods are based directly upon Genesis IX:3 and that \"these laws are binding on Jews today\".\n\nWhile supporters of kosher slaughter counter that Judaism requires the practice precisely because it is considered humane, Research conducted by Temple Grandin and Joe M. Regenstein in 1994 concluded that—practiced correctly with proper restraint systems—kosher slaughter results in little pain and suffering and notes that behavioral reactions to the incision made during kosher slaughter are less than those to noises such as clanging or hissing, inversion or pressure during restraint. those who practice and subscribe religiously and philosophically to Jewish vegetarianism disagree, stating that such slaughter is not required while a number, including medieval scholars of Judaism such as Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama, regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal, not just out of a concern for animal welfare, but also the slaughterer.\n\nOther forms of ritual slaughter, such as Islamic ritual slaughter, have also come under controversy. Writing for PETA, Logan Scherer said that animals sacrificed according to Islamic law can not be stunned before they are killed. Muslims are only allowed to eat meat that has been killed according to Sharia law and they say that Islamic law on ritual slaughter is designed to reduce the pain and distress that the animal suffers.\n\nAccording to the Farm Animal Welfare Committee, halal and kosher practices should be banned because when animals are not stunned before death, they suffer needless pain for up to 2 minutes despite some Muslims and Jews arguing that loss of blood from slash to the throat renders the animals unconscious relatively quickly.\n\nNot all religions are hostile to homosexuality. Both Reform Judaism and the Unitarian Universalist Association have advocated for equal rights for gay and lesbian people since the 1970s. Hinduism does not view homosexuality as an issue.\n\nMany Christians have made efforts toward establishing racial equality, contributing to the civil rights movement. \"The African American Review\" sees as important the role Christian revivalism in the black church played in the civil rights movement. Martin Luther King Jr., an ordained Baptist minister, was a leader of the American civil rights movement and president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a Christian civil rights organization.\n\nThe term \"dominionism\" is often used to describe a political movement among fundamentalist Christians. Critics view dominionism as an attempt to improperly impose Christianity as the national faith of the United States. It emerged in the late 1980s inspired by the book, film and lecture series \"Whatever Happened to the Human Race?\" by Francis A. Schaeffer and C. Everett Koop. Schaeffer's views influenced conservatives like Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Tim LaHaye, John W. Whitehead and although they represent different theological and political ideas, dominionists believe they have a Christian duty to take \"control of a sinful secular society\", either by putting fundamentalist Christians in office, or by introducing biblical law into the secular sphere. Social scientists have used the word \"dominionism\" to refer to adherence to dominion theology as well as to the influence in the broader Christian right of ideas inspired by dominion theology.\n\nIn the early 1990s, sociologist Sara Diamond and journalist Frederick Clarkson defined \"dominionism\" as a movement that while including dominion theology and Christian reconstructionism as subsets, it is much broader in scope, extending to much of the Christian right. Beginning in 2004 with essayist Katherine Yurica, a group of authors including journalist Chris Hedges Marion Maddox, James Rudin, Sam Harris and the group TheocracyWatch, began applying the term to a broader spectrum of people than have sociologists such as Diamond.\n\nThere are few full adherents to reconstructionism are limited to conservative Christians. The terms \"dominionist\" and \"dominionism\" are rarely used for self-description and their usage has been attacked from several quarters noting that the term is vague, unfairly links evangelicals to extremism, is highly exaggerated and are more akin to conservative smeer in the likes of a conspiracy theory. Journalist Anthony Williams charged that its purpose is \"to smear the Republican Party as the party of domestic Theocracy, facts be damned\". Kurtz also complained about a perceived link between average Christian evangelicals and extremism such as Christian reconstructionism.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56925556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56925556", "title": "Death-positive movement", "text": "Death-positive movement\n\nThe death-positive movement is a social and philosophical movement that encourages people to speak openly about death, dying, and corpses. The movement seeks to eliminate the silence around death-related topics, decrease anxiety surrounding death, and encourages more diversity in end of life care options available to the public.\n\nThe word death positivity was popularized by Caitlin Doughty as a play on the term sex positivity. However, the ideas behind the movement have existed much longer. The Order of the Good Death website lists the beliefs of the death-positive movement as being that cultural censorship of death and dying does more harm than good, that open discussions about death should be accepted as a natural human curiosity, that families should have full rights to care for the bodies of their loved ones without intervention from funeral businesses, and that end of life care should be diversified and performed in ways that cause less damage to the environment than our current practices. The movement also strongly encourages participants to speak to their families about their own end of life wishes, even if they are young and healthy and is critical of the commercialized funeral industry. It also encourages people to express their feelings about death through art.\n\n"}
{"id": "58448433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58448433", "title": "Egg predation", "text": "Egg predation\n\nEgg predation is a feeding strategy by animals (ovivores) including fish, birds, snakes and insects, in which they consume the eggs of other species. Since an egg represents a complete organism at one stage of its life cycle, eating an egg is a form of predation, the killing of another organism for food.\n\nEgg predation is found widely across the animal kingdom, including in insects such as ladybirds, molluscs such as the leech \"Cystobranchus virginicus\", fishes such as haddock, snakes such as colubrids, birds such as carrion crow and buzzard, and mammals such as red fox, badgers and pine martens. Some species are specialist egg predators, but many more are generalists which take eggs when the opportunity arises.\n\nSnakes specialising in egg predation have greatly reduced venom, implying that the main function of venom is to subdue prey.\n\nEgg predation is an ecological relationship in which an animal (a predator) hunts for and eats the eggs of another (prey) species. This reduces the evolutionary fitness of the parents whose eggs are preyed on. Among birds such as eider ducks in one study, half the individuals started a fresh clutch of eggs, always in a new nest, and they always avoided the area around the robbed nest. Egg predation rates can be high for ground-nesting birds such as the European golden plover, \"Pluvialis apricaria\": in Norway 78.2% of nests of this species were preyed on. Experimental removal of two nest and egg predators, red fox and carrion crow, in another study raised the percentage of pairs that fledged young from c. 18% to c. 75%. Population increases among many generalist predators such as buzzard, badger, carrion crow, pine marten, raven, and red fox in Scotland have contributed to the decline in several ground-nesting bird species by taking eggs, young, and sitting hen (female) birds.\n\nAmong fish, egg predation by species such as haddock (\"Melanogrammus aeglefinus\") can contribute to the decline in other fish populations such as of Atlantic herring (\"Clupea harengus\"). This effect can be important in attempts to restore fisheries damaged by overfishing.\n\nInvasive species such as the harlequin ladybird \"Harmonia axyridis\" frequently prey on eggs and young of native species, in its case including those of other ladybirds such as the two-spot ladybird \"Adalia bipunctata\". Females of the prey species laid eggs with higher amounts of defensive alkaloids when egg predation was occurring.\n\nSome colubrid snakes such as the Formosa kukri snake \"Oligodon formosanus\" specialise in egg predation. Egg predation by snakes is rarely opposed, but the Asian long-tailed skink \"Eutropis longicaudata\" aggressively protects its eggs from the Formosa kukri snake.\n\nEgg-eating snakes such as the marbled sea snake \"Aipysurus eydouxii\" have atrophied venom glands; this has been explained as an evolutionary consequence of their diet, since venom is not required to subdue their prey, unlike the case in their venomous and conventionally predatory ancestors. \n\nThe aquatic piscicolid leech \"Cystobranchus virginicus\" is an egg predator; it may be an obligate egg-feeder as it has not been seen feeding on an adult but has been found in the nests of a variety of species of North American freshwater fish of the genera \"Campostoma\" and \"Moxostoma\".\n\n"}
{"id": "779535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=779535", "title": "Federico Errázuriz Echaurren", "text": "Federico Errázuriz Echaurren\n\nFederico Errázuriz Echaurren (; November 16, 1850 – July 12, 1901) was a Chilean political figure. Born in Santiago, he served as President of Chile between 1896 and his death in 1901. Federico Errázuriz was of Basque descent.\n\nHe was born in Santiago, the first son of former president Federico Errázuriz Zañartu and of First Lady Eulogia Echaurren García-Huidobro. Errázuriz studied at the \"Padres Franceses\", the Instituto Nacional and the Universidad de Chile, where he graduated as a lawyer on March 26, 1873. In 1875, he married Gertrudis Echenique, and together they had two children: Federico and Elena. After the end of his studies, they moved to the hacienda of \"El Huique\", in the province of Colchagua, which he would continue to manage until his death.\n\nErrázuriz Echaurren joined the Liberal party and started his political life in 1876, when he was elected as a deputy for Constitución. He was reelected in 1879 and was characterized as a centrist politician. He did not participate in the campaigns of the War of the Pacific, preferring instead to remain in his hacienda, but during the religious controversies between Church and State under President Domingo Santa María, he joined the conservative forces. In August, 1890, President José Manuel Balmaceda named him Minister of War and Navy, under the so-called \"conciliation cabinet\" of Belisario Prats; but when Prats resigned his position, so did Errázuriz, and both joined the opposition. In 1891 he was one of the signatories of the Act of Deposition of Presidente Balmaceda. Even so, he did not participate in the 1891 Chilean Civil War.\n\nAfter the end of the civil war, he was elected deputy for Cauquenes and Constitución (1891–1894). His ill-health forced him to travel to Germany, in search of specialists. During a year and a half, he travelled through Europe, even visiting Pope Leo XIII. He returned to Chile and in 1894 was elected Senator for Maule and designed Minister of Justice and Public Instruction, under President Jorge Montt.\n\nAfter a very contested election, Errázuriz Echaurren was elected President and assumed power on September 18, 1896. He took over his office at the age of 46, but by then he already was showing the symptoms of the illness that was going to kill him before the end of his mandate. Both his supporters and the opposition considered him a man of great political cunning, but while his supporters saw him as a true patriot, the opposition pictured him as a corrupt politician capable of the worst excesses. These characterizations made his rule difficult from the start, since he had a majority on the Senate but not on the Chamber of Deputies. He received a country where the economic situation had steadily worsened due to the progressive crisis of the nitrate industry and the associated unemployment and social crisis caused by it; while the international relationships with Perú, Bolivia and Argentina were also in a critical state. To counteract the instability he tried to broaden the political consensus of his supporting coalition by forming a cabinet made up of three liberals and three conservatives, with the Liberal Aníbal Zañartu as Minister of the Interior. This seemingly impeccable arrangement only lasted for two months. In what was the norm during the governments of the period, Errázuriz Echaurren went on to have 17 cabinets during his administration.\n\nBetween 1896 and 1897, he named Carlos Antúnez as his Minister of the Interior and charged him with guaranteeing free and \"clean\" elections. Antúnez was in charge until after the general election of March, 1897, considered his mission accomplished after and resigned. This elections were greeted with general pleasure, but did not change the political support for the government, so Errázuriz Echaurren had to continue trying to achieve a balance in order to maintain a semblance of political stability. In the course of this search, Errázuriz Echaurren became closer and closer to the Conservative Party, until in 1898 he named Carlos Walker Martínez, president of the Conservatives as Minister of the Interior. Nonetheless, he remained always loyal to the coalition that elected him, and for example never allowed any member of the Radical party into any of his cabinets. Errázuriz's responses to the cabinet crisis, elections and in general to any problem within his administration was always consistent. He never took any decision without first consulting his political basis in congress, and always subordinated himself to the will of the political parties.\n\nErrázuriz's administration was characterized by a marked advancement in public education. Under his impulse, several institutions for the formation of health professionals were created, such as the courses for matrons and nurses, the \"\" of Valparaíso (Professional Institute for Girls), the \"Instituto Comercial\" of Santiago (Business Institute); and new high schools in Santiago and Iquique. This administration also contributed with new tram systems in Santiago, Valparaíso, San Felipe and San Bernardo. Errázuriz Echaurren contracted the new sewerage system for Santiago, and the water reservoir of Peñuelas, which still provides the water for Valparaíso.\n\nHe faced his biggest problems in the area of monetary policy. The much-wanted return to the metallic conversion, of which he was opposed but which was favored by the parliamentary majorities, was shelved due to the threat of a war with Argentina. The delay of the measure (until 1902) caused a public run on the banks, almost collapsing the banking system, and forcing the government to issue and put into circulation paper money.\n\nThe biggest problem that the administration had to face was on the international area. Chile and Argentina were on the brink of war, due to long-standing border disputes stemming from the peace treaty of 1881, the situation of the \"Puna de Atacama\" (a disputed territory formerly owned by Bolivia and claimed by both countries) and an ongoing naval arms race. President Errázuriz was avowedly pacifist, but at one point both countries actually got to the point where they called their reserve soldiers. The final solution was to submit the problem to an arbitration by the King of England, the adjudication of which was not resolved until 1902, during the administration of Germán Riesco, President Errázuriz's cousin and successor.\n\nTo celebrate the decision to arbitrate and avoid war, Presidente Errázuriz and Argentinian President Julio Argentino Roca held an international meeting in the Strait of Magellan. This meeting is known as the Embrace of the Strait () and took place in front of the city of Punta Arenas on February 15, 1899.\n\nAs most presidents of the time, he became involved early in the election of his successor. The Liberal-Conservative Coalition that supported him went on to proclaim Germán Riesco, cousin and brother-in-law of President Errázuriz, as their candidate on March 8, 1901. The President responded on a public letter: \"...as I have the firm purpose of not intervening in any political campaign and I don't have or want to have any candidate, I am firmly resolved to prevent the participation of any member of this administration in the upcoming elections\".\n\nErrázuriz's ill-health continued to plague him during all his period. Before his election, he already had had to travel to Germany in 1893 for treatment, and the death of his oldest son from tuberculosis in 1897 weakened him further. On June 11, 1900 he had to delegate his mandate on Elías Fernández, who assumed as Vice President, so he could travel again to seek medical advise. He reassumed his duties on October 11 of the same year, but died suddenly of cerebral thrombosis on July 12, 1901 while in Valparaíso. He was constitutionally replaced by his Minister of the Interior Aníbal Zañartu, who assumed as Vice President for the remainder of his mandate.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8951253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8951253", "title": "Frankfurt cases", "text": "Frankfurt cases\n\nFrankfurt cases (also known as Frankfurt counterexamples or Frankfurt-style cases) were presented by philosopher Harry Frankfurt in 1969 as counterexamples to the principle of alternate possibilities (PAP), which holds that an agent is morally responsible for an action only if that person could have done otherwise.\n\nThe principle of alternate possibilities (PAP) forms part of an influential argument for the incompatibility of responsibility and causal determinism, often called the \"core argument\" for incompatibilism. It was formulated by Libertarian Robert Kane. This argument is detailed below:\n\n(1) PAP: An agent is responsible for an action only if said agent could have done otherwise.\n\n(2) An agent could have done otherwise only if causal determinism is false.\n\n(3) Therefore, an agent is responsible for an action only if causal determinism is false.\n\nTraditionally, compatibilists (defenders of the compatibility of free will and determinism, like A. J. Ayer, Walter Terence Stace, and Daniel Dennett) reject premise two, arguing that, properly understood, free will is not incompatible with determinism. According to the traditional compatibilist analysis of free will, an agent is free to do otherwise when he would have done otherwise had he wanted to do otherwise. Agents may possess free will, according to the conditional analysis, even if determinism is true.\n\nFrom the PAP definition \"a person is morally responsible for what he has done only if he could have done otherwise\", Frankfurt infers that a person is not morally responsible for what he has done if he could not have done otherwise – a point with which he takes issue: our theoretical ability to do otherwise, he says, does not necessarily make it \"possible\" for us to do otherwise.\n\nFrankfurt's examples are significant because they suggest an alternative way to defend the compatibility of moral responsibility and determinism, in particular by rejecting the first premise of the argument. According to this view, responsibility is compatible with determinism because responsibility does not require the freedom to do otherwise.\n\nFrankfurt's examples involve agents who are intuitively responsible for their behavior even though they lack the freedom to act otherwise. Here is a typical case:\n\nIf Frankfurt is correct in suggesting both that Donald is morally responsible for voting Democratic and that he is not free to do otherwise, moral responsibility, in general, does not require that an agent have the freedom to do otherwise (that is, the principle of alternate possibilities is false). Thus, even if causal determinism is true, and even if determinism removes the freedom to do otherwise, there is no reason to doubt that people can still be morally responsible for their behavior.\n\nHaving presented his counter argument against the principle of alternate possibilities, Frankfurt suggests that it be revised to take into account the fallacy of the notion that coercion precludes an agent from moral responsibility. It must be \"only because\" of coercion that the agent acts as he does. The best definition, by his reckoning, is this: \"[A] person is not morally responsible for what he has done if he did it \"only because\" he could not have done otherwise.\"\n\nOne of the first objections raised by opponents of the Frankfurt-style cases is the two-horned dilemma. This objection was most notably raised by philosophers such as Widerker, Ginet, and Kane. The two-horned dilemma focuses on the connection between the agent's inclination and the agent's decision. This connection can be either deterministic or indeterministic.\n\nIf the connection between the agent's inclination and the agent's decision is deterministic, then proponents of the Frankfurt-style cases are charged with begging the question. A deterministic connection begs the question because proponents of Frankfurt-style cases are assuming the very thing that is being debated, that moral responsibility does not require alternate possibilities or the ability to do otherwise. Suppose the agent's inclination is causally sufficient for bringing about the agent's decision. This would mean that the agent was determined to make that decision prior to any kind of decision-making. Thus, the agent did not freely come to the decision for reasons of her own. Opponents of the Frankfurt-style cases would immediately contend that the agent is not morally responsible. This is because they are operating from the get-go that moral responsibility requires free will. Therefore, if the Frankfurt-style cases are operating within a metaphysically deterministic framework, then proponents of Frankfurt-style cases cannot reasonably expect their opponents to be convinced. Furthermore, Frankfurt-style cases would be begging the question since they are deriving moral responsibility from a completely deterministic scenario. \n\nOn the other hand, if the connection between the agent's inclination and the agent's decision is indeterministic, then opponents of the Frankfurt-style cases argue that the agent has the ability to do otherwise. This is problematic for proponents of the Frankfurt-style cases because they are supposed to show a situation where an agent is morally responsible her decision and yet is unable to truly do otherwise. Suppose the agent's inclination and the agent's decision is indeterministic. This means that the agent's inclination is not necessarily indicative of what the agent's decision will be. Thus, it is possible for the agent to show the correct inclination, evade the computer device, but then make the \"wrong\" decision. Even if the computer device kicks in after the \"wrong decision,\" the agent still encountered the ability to do otherwise. This kind of Frankfurt-style case would fail to present a situation where an agent is morally responsible while lacking alternate possibilities. \n\nThere have been a number of responses to the two-horned dilemma. One response has been to argue that a deterministic connection does not actually beg the question. Fischer has argued for this response by arguing that the Frankfurt-style case cannot stand alone, but must be taken in conjunction with other arguments. These other arguments are supposed to show that causal determinism in and of itself and apart from ruling out alternate possibilities does not threaten moral responsibility. \n\nA second response is to revise the Frankfurt-style cases. This revision consist in creating a case with an explicit indeterministic connection where the agent is still morally responsible without any alternate possibilities. These kind of Frankfurt-style cases do it by incorporating buffer zones that act to eliminate alternate possibilities.\n\nThe success of these responses are still being debated. It remains to be seen whether the Frankfurt style cases are successfully in showing what Harry Frankfurt intended them to show.\n\nMichael Otsuka provides a more specific answer to proposed problems with Frankfurt's counterexamples. In his article, Otsuka says,\n\"my strategy is to propose that the Principle of Alternate Possibilities be rejected in favor of a different incompatibilist principle,\" that is, different from Frankfurt's, \"that I call the 'Principle of Avoidable Blame'.\"\n\n"}

In contrast to Rh disease, about half of the cases of ABO HDN occur in a firstborn baby and ABO HDN does not become more severe after further pregnancies.\n\nThe ABO blood group system is the best known surface antigen system, expressed on a wide variety of human cells. For Caucasian populations about one fifth of all pregnancies have ABO incompatibility between the fetus and the mother, but only a very small minority develop symptomatic ABO HDN. The latter typically only occurs in mothers of blood group O, because they can produce enough IgG antibodies to cause hemolysis.\n\nAlthough very uncommon, cases of ABO HDN have been reported in infants born to mothers with blood groups A and B.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn about a third of all ABO incompatible pregnancies maternal IgG anti-A or IgG anti-B antibodies pass through the placenta to the fetal circulation leading to a weakly positive direct Coombs test for the neonate's blood. However, ABO HDN is generally mild and short-lived and only occasionally severe because:\n\nRoutine antenatal antibody screening blood tests (indirect Coombs test) do not screen for ABO HDN. If IgG anti-A or IgG anti-B antibodies are found in the pregnant woman's blood, they are not reported with the test results, because they do not correlate well with ABO HDN. Diagnosis is usually made by investigation of a newborn baby who has developed jaundice during the first week of life.\n\nTesting\n\nThe antibodies in ABO HDN cause anemia due to destruction of fetal red blood cells and jaundice due to the rise in blood levels of bilirubin a by-product of hemoglobin break down. If the anemia is severe, it can be treated with a blood transfusion, however this is rarely needed. On the other hand, neonates have underdeveloped livers that are unable to process large amounts of bilirubin and a poorly developed blood-brain barrier that is unable to block bilirubin from entering the brain.This can result in kernicterus if left unchecked. If the bilirubin level is sufficiently high as to cause worry, it can be lowered via phototherapy in the first instance or an exchange transfusion if severely elevated.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55003162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55003162", "title": "Infant crying", "text": "Infant crying\n\nInfant crying is the crying of infants as a response to an internal or external stimulus. Infants cry as a form of basic instinctive communication. Essentially, newborns are transitioning from life in the womb to the external environment. Up to 27% of parents describe problems with infant crying in the first four months. Up to 38% identify a problem with their infant crying within the first year. Parents can be concerned about the amount of time that their infant cries, how the infant can be consoled, and disrupted sleeping patterns. Colic is used as a synonym for excessive crying of infants, even though colic may not be the cause of excessive crying.\n\nCrying may elicit the Valsalva reflex. This reflex negatively impacts sucking pressures and results in poor feeding. The cortisol levels will rise along with blood pressure. Increased blood pressure will have an effect on cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood flow velocity and intracranial pressure. Increased pressures and velocity can lead to intracranial hemmorrhage. Prolonged exhalation may also cause some adverse effects. Obstructed venous return and quick inspiratory gasp can occur. Foramen ovale shunting can occur. Adults can often determine whether an infant's cries signify anger or pain. Most parents also have a better ability to distinguish their own infant's cries than those of a different child. Babies mimic their parents' pitch contour. French infants wail on a rising note while German infants favor a falling melody. Overstimulation may be a contributing factor to infant crying and that periods of active crying might serve the purpose of discharging overstimulation and helping the baby’s nervous system regain homeostasis.\n\nMisconceptions regarding the purpose of crying in the infant are common among caregivers and medical personnel. These are usually determined by cultural mores and not by evidence-based explanations. The crying of an infant is regarded by some to be normal and good. The belief that infants have a need to cry to expand or exercise their lungs is not supported by research. This is because a healthy newborn infant lung's are able to contain a sufficient amount of air plus a reserve. Birth trauma is related to the amount of crying. Mothers who had experienced obstetrical interventions or who were made to feel powerless during birth had babies who cried more than other babies. Babies who had experienced birth complications had longer crying spells at three months of age and awakened more frequently at night crying. When infants cry for no obvious reason after all other causes (such as hunger or pain) are ruled out, the crying may signify a beneficial stress-release mechanism, not all sources agree with this. The \"crying-in-arms\" approach is a way to comfort these infants. Another way of comforting and calming the baby is to mimic the familiarity of the mother’s womb. Consistency and promptness of maternal response is associated with a decline in frequency and duration of crying by the end of the first year individual differences in crying reflect the history of maternal responsiveness rather than constitutional differences in infant irritability. Online training to address the educational needs of the parents of the infant and caregivers in understanding and handling of infant crying.\n\nThough colic is often assumed to be the cause of excessive crying in infants, there are others:\n\nThe term 'colic' was defined in 1954 as: \" crying for more than three hours per day, for more than three days per week, and for more than three weeks in an infant that is well-fed and otherwise healthy.\" Colic and excessive crying by infants is synonymous to some clinicians. Colic is attributed to gastrointestinal discomfort like intestinal cramping. Clinicians often admit that colic can't be treated or that alternative treatments are ineffective. The protocol followed by clinicians to treat colic is described as \"treating the parents\" with reassurance.\n\nCrying in infants is associated with high stress levels and depression in mothers. Excessive crying has also been linked to maternal \"physical aggression\" and \"angry speaking\". The burden of care of the mother, that is, mothers without assistance in caring for the infant, are more prone to physical aggression and angry speaking. During evaluations of maternal depression responses to infant crying, sleeping problems are closely associated with excessive crying and may confound the conclusions of such research. Also, it is not always clear that when sleeping problems are associated with infant crying, whether the sleeping problems are descriptive of the mother or the infant or both. Maternal stress is associated with excessive crying.\n\nOne definition used to study excessive crying in infants is crying for three or more hours per 24 hours. Excessive infant crying has been associated with a twofold increased risk of the overall problem behavior, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6. Excessive infant crying doubles the risk of behavioral, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6, as reported by their mother. Excessive crying is not the only factor in later childhood difficulties. Behavioral problems in childhood include the so-called regulatory problems, such as excessive crying, sleeping, and feeding problems, which occur in 20% of infants in multiproblem families. Excessive crying, whining and sleeping problems at 4–6 months are associated with decreased social development at 12 months.\n\nSeveral factors may contribute to, and partly explain, an association between excessive infant crying and later behavioral and emotional problems. During early infancy, the quality of the mother–child dyad can be considered to be a crucial vehicle for child’s healthy mental development. Both early maternal and early paternal reciprocity in infancy are predictive of social competence and lower aggression in preschoolers.\n\nCompared to other infants, excessive crying infants had a slightly lower birth weight and a slightly younger gestational age. Excessive crying infants more often had a single, lower educated mother, originating from a non-industrialized country, who reported more depression, a higher burden of infant care, and more aggressive behavior and had an authoritarian parenting style. Excessive crying was associated with a higher risk for hyperactivity/inattention problems, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, peer relationship problems, and overall problem behavior at the age of 5–6, as well as a higher risk for decreased pro-social behavior as reported by the mother. Excessive crying was also associated with mood problems as well as generalized anxiety problems at the age of 5–6.\n\nThe physical abuse of infants is related to crying. Crying may be related to the abusive head trauma in infants. This is the most common cause of child abuse death. Fathers are often the ones who shake the infant. Shaking may occur many times. This shaking can cause serious injuries in almost 50% of the time. Some caregivers are unaware that shaking the baby can seriously harm or kill the infant. This type of abuse is being addressed by efforts to educate parents and caregivers with educational flyers and videos.\n\nInfant crying is worse in the first few months of life, but improves as the child grows. A baby can sometimes be calmed by rocking gently, offering a pacifier, singing or talking softly, taking a walk with a stroller, or going for a drive in the car. If a baby won’t stop crying, it can be sick and seen by a doctor. Frustration and stress can be overwhelming for those with a crying infant. If caregivers feel as if they may lose control there are preventative measures that can be taken. The caregiver may benefit by calling a friend, relative, neighbor, or parent helpline for support. Another suggestion is to put the baby in a safe place and walk away. The baby can be checked every 5 to 10 minutes. \nBabies may be in danger if a person who is easily irritated or has a temper or history of violence cares for or watches the baby.\n\nWhen \"normal\" causes of excessive crying are ruled out, some caregivers adopt alternative and complementary treatments for excessive crying. Those practices include: \n\nThose who realize that an infant can be in a situation where abuse is a possibility, support can be offered to give a parent or caregiver a break when needed. Education and understanding can let the parent know that dealing with a crying baby can be very frustrating—especially when they are tired or stressed, but infant crying is normal and it will pass. Parents can be encouraged to take a calming break if needed while the baby is safe in the crib. Others can be sensitive and supportive in situations when parents are trying to calm a crying baby.\n"}

She was also among several female journalists who were establishing their reputations as reporters during the war, such as Rima Maktabi and Najwa Qassem.\nNajib is one of seven journalists to have been killed since the end of civil war in 1990. Najib's death follows behind that of female journalist Atwar Bahjat who was killed while covering the Iraq War.\n\nThe 2006 war was a turning point for female reporters' ability to report at the front lines alongside male reporters. The female journalists of this generation had either lived or practiced journalism during the Lebanon Civil War (1975-1990) but news organizations did not provide them with any training. Najib's death and her job as a photojournalist was mentioned alongside the successes of other females such as Maktabi and Qassem, who were TV journalists in front of the camera.\n\nLayal Najib was from Tripoli, Lebanon. She had been at \"Al Jaras\" for three years but a photographer for 1 year and 8 months. Prior to working for \"Al Jaras\", Najib was a local freelance photographer. She also had been a freelance photojournalist for the international news agency Agence France Presse.\nFor Layal Najib and other Lebanese female journalists, the 2006 war was their first opportunity to cover a combat environment. Najib was reporting on the Israeli bombings in southern Lebanon for \"Al Jaras\" at the time of her death.\n\nLayal Najib was on her way to Sadiqeen to interview and photograph the population that was fleeing under Israeli artillery fire. Those who drove the same route at that time described a drive through a bombed out main road, obstacles that blocked the road, and vehicles that were littered the side of the road, and sometimes alternative routes were all that was available. The Israeli Defense Force killed Layal Najib immediately 23 July 2006 when shrapnel from one of its missiles shot through the roof of her taxi while she was being driven between the villages of Sadiqeen and Qana, which are near Tyre, Lebanon. The driver of the taxi, who said he had driven her from Beirut, survived, and said the Red Cross had taken her corpse to a hospital and Tyre.\n\nThe 2006 Lebanon War was a 33-day conflict between Lebanon and Israel that began after Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah conducted a cross-border raid. The population in southern Lebanon was fleeing cities and villages to avoid bombardments. Tyre's population dwindled down to 20 percent as the majority fled. During the period when Najib was killed, Israeli forces had been \"indiscriminately\" attacking cars, as reported by those attacked, that were driving along southern Lebanon's roads into order to flee. According to a \"Washington Post\" report, Israelis ordered villagers from Tairi to evacuate and then later an Israeli helicopter fired a missile at a white minibus fleeing from there and killed seven out of the 19 passengers. Human Rights Watch claimed ambulances that are not to be targeted during combat were also bombed. Although conservatives called the strike on the ambulances a hoax, HRW confirmed the attack and released a report.\n\nThe International Press Institute conducted interviews among members of the Lebanese media in December 2006 and concluded that they suffered \"fear for their personal safety\" as a consequence of violence that dates back to assassination of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005 and violence against the media that escalated afterwards and culminated in the war. The report describes a destabilized media environment.\nMedia were also targeted by the Israeli forces during the war. The International Federation of Journalists protested after the sixth attack on media. The first media worker killed during the 2006 Lebanon War Suleiman Al Chidiac on 22 July 2006 when Israeli's bombed a Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation transmission facility just north of Beirut.\nFour years after Najib, Assaf Abu Rahhal was the next Lebanese journalist killed by the Israel Defense Forces along the southern Lebanese-Israeli border.\n\nKoïchiro Matsuura, director-general of UNESCO, issued a statement following Al Chidiac's and Najib's death: \"In times of violent conflict it is essential for all parties to respect the important role the media play in enabling the public to make informed choices and working towards peace and democracy. Belligerents can not regard media staff and media outlets as military targets. And in times of extreme hardship for the region, with hundreds of civilian deaths, the courage of journalists attempting to keep us informed of events deserves recognition.\"\nThe International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) wrote a letter to the head of the Israeli Defense Force, asking for an investigation into the cases of the attacks on journalists. IFJ General Secretary Aidan White said, \"It is imperative that we have answers about these incidents otherwise speculation about targeting media will persist. The Israeli authorities must make it clear to military commanders that unarmed journalists and media are non-combats. They must not come under fire.\" The statement drew a sharp response for the national affiliate of the IFJ in Israel when the leader of the National Federation of Israeli Journalists \"suspended\" the relationship and said the IFJ was biased against Israel. The international organization continued to press Israel about the six attacks, including two deaths, it had counted against media.\nReporters Without Borders said, \"We are appalled that the Israeli army is taking so few precautions to avoid civilian deaths or casualties, especially among the media. We demand that the Israel government investigate the shooting that killed Nagib. We will not be satisfied by the army's standard response that the targets were military ones like to Hezbollah.\"\n\nJoel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: \"We are gravely concerned by the killings of our colleagues Layal Najib and Suleiman al-Chidiac. The aerial bombardment of Lebanon by Israel has caused tremendous hardships to civilians, including journalists who are covering the humanitarian crisis. We are alarmed by the air attacks on television transmission and telecommunication facilities. These strikes have already cost the life of one television technician and wounded another.

{"id": "187904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187904", "title": "Louise Brooks", "text": "Louise Brooks\n\nMary Louise Brooks (November 14, 1906 – August 8, 1985) was an American film actress and dancer known professionally as Louise Brooks, who was noted as an iconic symbol of the flapper, and for popularizing the bobbed haircut.\n\nBrooks is best known as the lead in three feature films made in Europe: \"Pandora's Box\" (1929), \"Diary of a Lost Girl\" (1929), and \"Miss Europe\" (1930); the first two were made by G. W. Pabst. She starred in seventeen silent films and eight sound films before retiring in 1938. Brooks published her memoir, \"Lulu in Hollywood\", in 1982; three years later she died of a heart attack at the age of 78.\n\nBorn in Cherryvale, Kansas, Louise Brooks was the daughter of Leonard Porter Brooks, a lawyer, who was usually busy with his practice, and Myra Rude, an artistic mother who said that any \"squalling brats she produced could take care of themselves\".\n\nRude was a talented pianist who played the latest Debussy and Ravel for her children, inspiring them with a love of books and music.\n\nWhen she was nine years old, a neighborhood man sexually abused Louise. This event had a major influence on her life and career, causing her to say in later years that she was incapable of real love, and that this man \"must have had a great deal to do with forming my attitude toward sexual pleasure...For me, nice, soft, easy men were never enough – there had to be an element of domination\". When Brooks at last told her mother of the incident, many years later, her mother suggested that it must have been Louise's fault for \"leading him on\".\n\nBrooks began her entertainment career as a dancer, joining the Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts modern dance company in Los Angeles in 1922. The company included founders Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, as well as a young Martha Graham. In her second season with the company, Brooks advanced to a starring role in one work opposite Shawn. A long-simmering personal conflict between Brooks and St. Denis boiled over one day, and St. Denis abruptly fired Brooks from the troupe in 1924, telling her in front of the other members, \"I am dismissing you from the company because you want life handed to you on a silver salver\". The words left a strong impression on Brooks; when she drew up an outline for a planned autobiographical novel in 1949, \"The Silver Salver\" was the title she gave the tenth and final chapter. Brooks was 15 years old at the time of her dismissal.\n\nThanks to her friend Barbara Bennett, the sister of Constance and Joan Bennett, Brooks almost immediately found employment as a chorus girl in \"George White's Scandals\", followed by an appearance as a featured dancer in the 1925 edition of the \"Ziegfeld Follies\" on Broadway. As a result of her work in the \"Follies\", she came to the attention of Paramount Pictures producer Walter Wanger, who signed her to a five-year contract with the studio in 1925. She was also noticed by visiting movie star Charlie Chaplin, who was in town for the premiere of his film \"The Gold Rush\". The two had a two-month affair that summer.\n\nBrooks made her screen debut in the silent \"The Street of Forgotten Men\", in an uncredited role in 1925. Soon, however, she was playing the female lead in a number of silent light comedies and flapper films over the next few years, starring with Adolphe Menjou and W. C. Fields, among others.\n\nBrooks had an on-and-off affair with Walter Wanger, head of Paramount Pictures, and after her small roles in 1925, both Paramount and MGM offered her contracts. Wanger tried to encourage her to take the MGM contract, so as to avoid rumors that she only got the Paramount contract because of her association with him, but she decided to go with its offer anyhow.\n\nShe was noticed in Europe for her pivotal vamp role in the 1928 Howard Hawks silent \"buddy film\" \"A Girl in Every Port\".\n\nIn the early sound film drama \"Beggars of Life\" (1928), Brooks played an abused country girl who kills her foster father in a moment of desperation. A hobo, Richard Arlen, happens on the murder scene and convinces Brooks to disguise herself as a young boy and escape the law by \"riding the rails\" with him. In a hobo encampment, or \"jungle,\" they meet another hobo, Wallace Beery. Brooks's disguise is soon uncovered and she finds herself the only female in a world of brutal, sex-hungry men. Much of this film was shot on location, and the boom microphone was invented for this film by the director William Wellman, who needed it for one of the first experimental talking scenes in the movies.\n\nBy this time in her life, she was mixing with the rich and famous, and was a regular guest of William Randolph Hearst and his mistress, Marion Davies, at San Simeon, being close friends with Davies' niece, Pepi Lederer. Her distinctive bob haircut helped start a trend; many women styled their hair in imitation of her and fellow film star Colleen Moore. Soon after \"Beggars Of Life\" was made, Brooks, who loathed the Hollywood \"scene\", refused to stay on at Paramount after being denied a promised raise, and left for Europe to make films for G. W. Pabst, the prominent Austrian Expressionist director.\n\nParamount attempted to use the coming of sound films to pressure the actress, but she called the studio's bluff. It was not until 30 years later that this rebellious move would come to be seen as arguably the savviest of her career, securing her immortality as a silent film legend and independent spirit. While her initial snubbing of Paramount alone would not have finished her in Hollywood altogether, her refusal after returning from Germany to come back to Paramount for sound retakes of \"The Canary Murder Case\" (1929) irrevocably placed her on an unofficial blacklist. Margaret Livingston was hired to dub Brooks's voice for the film, as the studio claimed that Brooks's voice was unsuitable for sound pictures.\n\nOnce in Germany, she starred in the 1929 film \"Pandora's Box\", directed by Pabst in his New Objectivity period. The film is based on two plays by Frank Wedekind (\"Erdgeist\" and \"Die Büchse der Pandora\") and Brooks plays the central figure, Lulu. This film is notable for its frank treatment of modern sexual mores, including one of the first screen portrayals of a lesbian. Brooks then starred in the controversial social drama \"Diary of a Lost Girl\" (1929), based on the book by Margarete Böhme and also directed by Pabst, and \"Miss Europe\" (1930) by Italian director Augusto Genina, the latter filmed in France, and having a famous surprise ending. All these films were heavily censored, as they were very \"adult\" and considered shocking for their portrayals of sexuality as well as their social satire.\n\nWhen she returned to Hollywood in 1931, she was cast in two mainstream films, \"God's Gift to Women\" (1931) and \"It Pays to Advertise\" (1931), but her performances in these films were largely ignored, and few other job offers were forthcoming due to her informal \"blacklisting\". \n\nDespite this, William Wellman, her director on \"Beggars of Life\", offered her the female lead in his new picture, \"The Public Enemy\", starring James Cagney. Brooks turned down the role in order to visit her then-lover George Preston Marshall in New York City, and the part instead went to Jean Harlow, who began her own rise to stardom largely as a result. Brooks later explained to Wellman that she simply \"hated Hollywood\", and according to film historian James Card, who came to know Brooks intimately later in her life, \"she just wasn't interested ... She was more interested in Marshall\".\n\nIn the opinion of Brooks's biographer Barry Paris, \"turning down \"Public Enemy\" marked the real end of Louise Brooks's film career\". She made one more film at that time, a comedy short, \"Windy Riley Goes Hollywood\" (1931), directed by Hollywood outcast Fatty Arbuckle, working under the pseudonym \"William Goodrich\".\n\nBrooks declared bankruptcy in 1932 and began dancing in nightclubs to earn a living. She attempted a comeback in 1936, and did a bit part in the Western \"Empty Saddles\", which led Columbia to offer her a screen test, contingent on appearing in the 1937 musical \"When You're in Love\", uncredited, as a specialty ballerina in the chorus. She made two more films after that, including \"Overland Stage Raiders\" (1938), a \"B\" Western in which she played the romantic lead, opposite John Wayne, with a long hairstyle that rendered her all but unrecognizable from her Lulu days.\n\nBrooks then briefly returned to Wichita, where she was raised. \"But that turned out to be another kind of hell,\" she said. \"The citizens of Wichita either resented me having been a success or despised me for being a failure. And I wasn't exactly enchanted with them. I must confess to a lifelong curse: My own failure as a social creature.\" After an unsuccessful attempt at operating a dance studio, she returned East and, after brief stints as a radio actor and a gossip columnist, worked as a salesgirl in a Saks Fifth Avenue store in New York City for a few years, then lived as a courtesan with a few select wealthy men as clients.\nBrooks had been a heavy drinker since the age of 14, but remained relatively sober to begin writing about film, which became her second career. During this period she began her first major writing project, an autobiographical novel called \"Naked on My Goat\", a title taken from Goethe's \"Faust\". After working on the novel for a number of years, she destroyed the manuscript by throwing it into an incinerator.\n\nFrench film historians rediscovered Brooks's films in the early 1950s, proclaiming her an actress who surpassed even Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo as a film icon, much to her amusement. This led to the still ongoing Louise Brooks film revivals and rehabilitated her reputation in her home country.\n\nJames Card, the film curator for the George Eastman House, discovered Brooks living as a recluse in New York City about this time, and persuaded her to move to Rochester, New York, to be near the George Eastman House film collection. With his help, she became a noted film writer. A collection of her writings, \"Lulu in Hollywood\", was published in 1982. She was profiled by the film writer Kenneth Tynan in his essay \"The Girl in The Black Helmet\", the title an allusion to her bobbed hair, worn since childhood.\n\nShe rarely gave interviews, but had special relationships with film historians John Kobal and Kevin Brownlow. In the 1970s she was interviewed extensively on film for the documentaries \"\" (1976), produced and directed by Gary Conklin, and \"Hollywood\" (1980), by Brownlow and David Gill. \"Lulu in Berlin\" (1984) is another rare filmed interview, produced by Richard Leacock and Susan Woll, released a year before her death but filmed a decade earlier. Author Tom Graves was allowed into Brooks's apartment for an interview in 1982, and later wrote about the at times awkward and tense conversation in his article \"My Afternoon With Louise Brooks\", the lead piece in his book \"Louise Brooks, Frank Zappa, & Other Charmers & Dreamers\".\n\nIn the summer of 1926, Brooks married Eddie Sutherland, the director of the film she made with W. C. Fields, but by 1927 had fallen \"terribly in love\" with George Preston Marshall, owner of a chain of laundries and future owner of the Washington Redskins football team, following a chance meeting with him that she later referred to as \"the most fateful encounter of my life\". She divorced Sutherland, mainly due to her budding relationship with Marshall, in June 1928.\n\nIn 1933, she married Chicago millionaire Deering Davis, a son of Nathan Smith Davis, Jr., but abruptly left him in March 1934 after only five months of marriage, \"without a good-bye... and leaving only a note of her intentions\" behind her. According to Card, Davis was just \"another elegant, well-heeled admirer\", nothing more. The couple officially divorced in 1938.\n\nDespite her two marriages, she never had children, referring to herself as \"Barren Brooks\". Her many lovers from years before had included a young William S. Paley, the founder of CBS. According to \"Louise Brooks: Looking For Lulu\", Paley provided a small monthly stipend to Brooks for the rest of her life, and according to the documentary this stipend kept her from committing suicide at one point.\n\nBrooks described her on-again, off-again relationship with George Preston Marshall throughout the 1920s and 1930s as abusive. He was the biggest reason she was able to secure a contract with Pabst. Marshall repeatedly asked her to marry him, but after finding that she had had many affairs while they were together, married film actress Corinne Griffith instead.\n\nSometime before 1955, Brooks converted to Roman Catholicism.\n\nBy her own admission, Brooks was a sexually liberated woman, unafraid to experiment, even posing nude for art photography, and her liaisons with many film people were legendary, although much of it is speculation.\n\nBrooks enjoyed fostering speculation about her sexuality, cultivating friendships with lesbian and bisexual women including Pepi Lederer and Peggy Fears, but eschewing relationships. She admitted to some lesbian dalliances, including a one-night stand with Greta Garbo. She later described Garbo as masculine but a \"charming and tender lover\". Despite all this, she considered herself neither lesbian nor bisexual:\n\nOn August 8, 1985, Brooks was found dead of a heart attack after suffering from arthritis and emphysema for many years. She was buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Rochester, New York.\n\nAs is the case with many of her contemporaries, a number of Brooks's films are considered to be lost. Her key films survive, however, particularly \"Pandora's Box\" and \"Diary of a Lost Girl\", which have been released on DVD in North America by the Criterion Collection and Kino Video, respectively.\n\nAs of 2007, \"Miss Europe\" and \"The Show Off\" have also seen limited North American DVD release. Her short film (and one of her only talkies) \"Windy Riley Goes Hollywood\" was included on the DVD release of \"Diary of a Lost Girl\". Her final film, \"Overland Stage Raiders\", was released on VHS and in 2012 on DVD.\n\nLouise Brooks as an unattainable film image served as an inspiration for Adolfo Bioy Casares when he wrote his science fiction novel \"The Invention of Morel\" (1940) about a man attracted to Faustine, a woman who is only a projected 3-D image.\n\nIn a 1995 interview, Casares explained that Faustine is directly based on his love for Louise Brooks who \"vanished too early from the movies\". (Elements of \"The Invention of Morel\", minus the science fiction elements, served as a basis for Alain Resnais's 1961 film \"Last Year at Marienbad\".)\n\nBrooks also had an influence in the graphics world – she had the distinction of inspiring two separate comics: the long-running \"Dixie Dugan\" newspaper strip by John H. Striebel that started in the late 1920s and ran until 1966, which grew out of the serialized novel and later stage musical, \"Show Girl\", that writer J.P. McEvoy had loosely based on Louise's days as a Follies girl on Broadway; and the erotic comic books of \"Valentina\", by the late Guido Crepax, which began publication in 1965 and continued for many years. Crepax became a friend and regular correspondent with Louise late in her life. Hugo Pratt, another comics artist, also used her as inspiration for characters, and even named them after her.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

Bush era Vision for Space Exploration, which has been replaced with President Barack Obama's space policy. The outpost would have been an inhabited facility on the surface of the Moon. At the time it was proposed, NASA was to construct the outpost over the five years between 2019 and 2024. The United States Congress directed that the U.S. portion, \"shall be designated the Neil A. Armstrong Lunar Outpost\".\n\nOn December 4, 2006, NASA announced the conclusion of its Global Exploration Strategy and Lunar Architecture Study. The Lunar Architecture Study's purpose was to \"define a series of lunar missions constituting NASA's Lunar campaign to fulfill the Lunar Exploration elements\" of the Vision for Space Exploration.\nWhat resulted was a basic plan for a lunar outpost near one of the poles of the Moon, which would permanently house astronauts in six-month shifts. These studies were made before the discovery of water ice (5.6 ± 2.9% by mass) in a polar crater, which may substantially affect plans.\n\nA reference architecture was established for this outpost, based on a location on the rim of the Shackleton crater, located in the immense South Pole-Aitken basin, near the Moon's south pole.\nAt a presentation on December 4, 2006, Doug Cooke (Deputy Associate Administrator, NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate) described an area \"that is... sunlit... 75 to 80 percent of the time, and it is adjacent to a permanently dark region in which there are potentially volatiles that we can extract and use... This sunlit area is about the size of the Washington Mall.\" (approximately 1.25 km²). The Indian Chandrayaan orbiter helped in the determination of the precise location of the outpost.\n\nOther locations considered for possible lunar outposts included the rim of Peary crater near the lunar north pole and the Malapert Mountain region on the rim of Malapert crater.\n\nThe outpost design included:\n\nThe outpost would have been supplied by a mixed crew and cargo Altair lander, capable of bringing four astronauts and a payload of six tons to the Moon's surface.\n\nAs planned, an incremental buildup would begin with four-person crews making several seven-day visits to the moon until their power supplies, rovers and living quarters were operational. The first mission would begin by 2020. This would be followed by 180-day missions to prepare for journeys to Mars.\n\nThe concept of establishing a long-term human presence on the Moon can be traced back to the late 1950s. The Lunex Project, conceptualized in 1958, was a US Air Force plan to construct an underground Air Force Base on the Moon. On June 8, 1959, the US Army's Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) organized a task force called Project Horizon to assess the feasibility of constructing a military base on the Moon.\n\nProject Horizon proposed using a series of Saturn launches to pre-construct an outpost while in Earth orbit, with the intention of subsequently delivering and landing the completed assembly on the Moon. Additional Saturn launches each month would then ship supplies to the inhabitants.\n\nJapanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) plans a manned lunar landing around 2020 that would lead to a manned lunar base by 2030; however, there is no budget yet for this project.\n\nChina National Space Administration (CNSA) has commenced the Chang'e program for exploring the Moon to investigate the prospect of lunar mining, specifically for mining isotope helium-3 for use as an energy source on Earth. CNSA director Luan Enjie has stated, humans must learn to leave Earth and \"set up self-sufficient extraterrestrial homeland.\" China launched the Chang'e 1 robotic lunar orbiter on October 10, 2007.\n\nThe Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) has planned a fully robotic lunar base called Lunny Poligon. The project is planned for 2020, with an expected completion date of 2037.\n\nIn the words of former NASA Administrator, Michael D. Griffin,\n\nNASA proposes six \"Lunar exploration themes\" to answer the question, \"Why should we return to the Moon?\"\n\n\nAccording to retired NASA Office of Inspector General Senior Special Agent Joseph Richard Gutheinz, Jr., if \"NASA succeeds, we may very well see the first permanent manned presence on the moon in 2024.\" Gutheinz, who teaches risk management, once investigated the Mir Space Station fire and collision and frequently speaks out against unnecessary risks in space, although he considers settling the moon to be an acceptable risk.\n\nCriticisms come from groups that want the manned exploration money diverted to Mars, from those who prefer unmanned exploration, and from those who simply want the money spent elsewhere. The criticisms listed here mostly predate the discovery of significant amounts of polar water ice. Jeff Foust, writing for \"The Space Review\", called the six themes that NASA released too \"broad\" and the explanations supporting them \"shallow.\" He also argues that a Moon base is a poor use of resources, since \"science can be done for far less money by robotic missions—which also don't put human lives at risk.\" The \"Los Angeles Times\" seconded that in an editorial, saying \"Manned moon flight may appeal to baby boomers, but it makes little scientific sense for most space missions these days. Robots can now perform, or be developed to perform, most of the tasks people would do at a moon station.\" \n\nColumnist Gregg Easterbrook, who has reported on the space program for decades, has criticized the plans as a poor use of resources. He writes that\n\nAlthough, of course, the base could yield a great discovery, its scientific value is likely to be small while its price is extremely high. Worse, moon-base nonsense may for decades divert NASA resources from the agency's legitimate missions, draining funding from real needs in order to construct human history's silliest white elephant.\n\nAccording to Easterbrook, the billions of dollars that a lunar colony might cost should instead be devoted to exploring the solar system with space probes; space observatories; and protecting the Earth from near-Earth asteroids.\n\nBuzz Aldrin, the second of twelve men to have walked on the Moon, disagrees with NASA's current goals and priorities, including their plans for a lunar outpost. While not necessarily opposed to sending people back to the Moon, Aldrin argues that NASA should concentrate on a crewed mission to Mars and leave further lunar exploration and the establishment of a base there to a consortium of other countries under U.S. leadership. In a July 2009 editorial in the \"Washington Post\", he said that NASA's Vision for Space Exploration \"is not visionary; nor will it ultimately be successful in restoring American space leadership. Like its Apollo predecessor, this plan will prove to be a dead end littered with broken spacecraft, broken dreams and broken policies.\" He continued by saying that\n\nthe lunar surface... is a poor location for homesteading. The moon is a lifeless, barren world, its stark desolation matched by its hostility to all living things. And replaying the glory days of Apollo will not advance the cause of American space leadership or inspire the support and enthusiasm of the public and the next generation of space explorers.\n\nOn June 6, 2008 NASA announced a set of six research opportunities and requested proposals for research funding in response to the announcement. The overall budget for research conducted as part of this \"Lunar Surface Systems Concepts Study\" is anticipated to be $2 million. Proposals will be selected and contracts awarded in August 2008 by the NASA Constellation Lunar Surface Systems Project Office (LSSPO).\n\nThe LSSPO was established at the Johnson Space Center in August 2007. The LSSPO was studying lunar surface systems such as \"habitation systems\", ISRU, rovers, power production and storage, systems to meet science and exploration objectives and safety systems. The LSSPO was expected to conduct a surface system concept review in the 2010 or 2011 timeframe.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50024", "title": "Lust", "text": "Lust\n\nLust is a psychological force producing intense wanting for an object, or circumstance fulfilling the emotion.\nLust can take any form such as the lust for sexuality, money or power. It can take such mundane forms as the lust for food as distinct from the need for food.\n\nReligions, especially Christianity, tend to draw a distinction between passion and lust by further categorizing lust as an inappropriate desire or a desire that is inappropriately strong, and therefore morally wrong, whereas passion (for proper purposes) is maintained to be something God-given and moral.\n\nLust holds a critical position in the philosophical underpinnings of Buddhist reality. It is named in the second of the Four Noble Truths, which are that \n\nLust is the, attachment to, identification with, and passionate desire for certain things in existence, all of which relate to the form, sensation, perception, mentality, and consciousness that certain combinations of these things engender within us. Lust is thus the ultimate cause of general imperfection and the most immediate \"root\" cause of a certain suffering.\n\nThe passionate desire for either non-existence or for freedom from lust is a common misunderstanding. For example, the headlong pursuit of lust (or other \"deadly sin\") in order to fulfill a desire for death is followed by a reincarnation accompanied by a self-fulfilling karma, resulting in an endless wheel of life, until the right way to live, the right worldview, is somehow discovered and practiced. Beholding an endless knot puts one, symbolically, in the position of the one with the right worldview, representing that person who attains freedom from lust.\n\nIn existence are four kinds of things that engender the clinging: rituals, worldviews, pleasures, and the self. The way to eliminate lust is to learn of its unintended effects and to pursue righteousness as concerns a worldview, intention, speech, behavior, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration, in the place where lust formerly sat.\nIn many translations of the New Testament, the word \"lust\" translates the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω, particularly in :\nIn English-speaking countries, the term \"lust\" is often associated with sexual desire, probably because of this verse. But just as the English word was originally a general term for \"desire\", the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω was also a general term for desire. The LSJ lexicon suggests \"set one's heart upon a thing, long for, covet, desire\" as glosses for ἐπιθυμέω, which is used in verses that clearly have nothing to do with sexual desire. In the Septuagint, ἐπιθυμέω is the word used in the commandment to not covet:\n\nWhile coveting your neighbor's wife may involve sexual desire, it's unlikely that coveting a neighbor's house or field is sexual in nature. And in most New Testament uses, the same Greek word, ἐπιθυμέω, does not have a clear sexual connotation. For example, from the American Standard Version the same word is used outside of any sexual connotation:\n\n\nAccording to the Catholic Encyclopedia, a Christian's heart is lustful when \"venereal satisfaction is sought for either outside wedlock or, at any rate, in a manner which is contrary to the laws that govern marital intercourse\". Pope John Paul II said that lust devalues the eternal attraction of male and female, reducing personal riches of the opposite sex to an object for gratification of sexuality.\n\nLust is considered by Catholicism to be a disordered desire for sexual pleasure, where sexual pleasure is \"sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes\". In Catholicism, sexual desire in itself is good, and is considered part of God's plan for humanity. However, when sexual desire is separated from God's love, it becomes disordered and self-seeking. This is seen as lust.\n\nThe Latin for \"extravagance\" (Latin: \"luxuria\") was used by St Jerome to translate a variety of biblical sins, including drunkenness and sexual excess. Gregory the Great placed \"luxuria\" as one of the seven capital sins (it is often considered the least serious of the seven deadly sins), narrowing its scope to disordered desire, and it was in this sense that the Middle Ages generally took \"luxuria\", (although the Old French cognate was adopted into English as \"luxury\" without its sexual meaning by the 14th century).\n\nIn Romanesque art, the personified Luxuria is generally feminine, often represented by a siren or a naked woman with breasts being bitten by snakes. Prudentius in his Psychomachia or Battle of the Soul had described Luxury, lavish of her ruined fame, Loose-haired, wild-eyed, her voice a dying fall, Lost in delight... For Dante, Luxuria was both the first of the circles of incontinence (or self-indulgence) on the descent into hell, and the last of the cornices of Mount Purgatory, representing the excessive (disordered) love of individuals; while for Spenser luxuria was synonymous with the power of desire.\n\nThe daughters (by-products) of Luxuria, for Gregory and subsequent Thomism, included mental blindness, self-love, haste and excessive attachment to the present: Marianne Dashwood has been seen as embodying such characteristics for a later age – as a daughter of Luxuria.\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna, an Avatar of Vishnu, declared in verse 21 that lust is one of the gates to Naraka or hell.\n\nIn this ancient manuscript the idea behind the word 'Lust' is best comprehended as the psychological force called 'Wanting'.\n\nAccording to Brahma Kumaris, a spiritual organization which is based on Hindu philosophy, sexual lust is the greatest enemy to all mankind and the gateway to hell.\n\nFor this reason followers do not eat onions, garlic, eggs, or non-vegetarian food, as the \"sulphur\" in them can excite sexual lust in the body, otherwise bound to celibacy.\n\nThe physical act of sex is \"impure\", leading to body-consciousness and other crimes. This impurity \"poisons\" the body and leads to many kinds of \"diseases\".\n\nThe Brahma Kumaris teach that sexuality is like foraging about in a dark sewer. Students at Spiritual University must conquer lust in order to find the Golden Age, a heaven on earth, where children are conceived by an asexual power of mind, and lasting for 2,500 years in the peace and purity of a holy swan moving on earth, over water, and in air.\n\nIn Islam, intentional lascivious glances are forbidden. Lascivious thoughts are disliked, for they are the first step towards adultery, rape and other antisocial behaviors. Prophet Muhammad also stressed the magnitude of the \"second glance\", as the first glance towards an attractive member of the opposite sex could be just accidental or observatory, the second glance could be that gate into lustful thinking. Islam does not advocate celibacy but it requires marriage to conduct sex legally.\n\nIn Judaism, all evil inclinations and lusts of the flesh are characterized by \"Yetzer hara\" (Hebrew, יצר הרע, the evil inclination). Yetzer hara is not a demonic force; rather, it is man's misuse of the things which the physical body needs to survive, and is often contrasted with \"yetzer hatov\" (Hebrew, יצר הטוב, the positive desire).\n\n\"Yetzer HaRa\" is often identified with Satan and the angel of death, and there is sometimes a tendency to give a personality and separate activity to the \"yetzer\". For the \"yetzer\", like Satan, misleads man in this world, and testifies against him in the world to come. The \"yetzer\" is, however, clearly distinguished from Satan, and on other occasions is made exactly parallel to sin. The Torah is considered the great antidote against this force. Though, like all things which God has made, the \"yetzer hara\" (evil inclination) can be manipulated into doing good: for without it, man would never marry, beget a child, build a house, or occupy himself in a trade.\n\nFew ancient, pagan religions actually considered lust to be a vice. The most famous example of a widespread religious movement practicing lechery as a ritual is the Bacchanalia of the Ancient Roman Bacchantes. However, this activity was soon outlawed by the Roman Senate in 186 BC in the decree \"Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus\". The practice of sacred prostitution, however, continued to be an activity practiced often by the Dionysians.\n\nIn Sikhism, lust is counted among the five cardinal sins or sinful propensities, the others being Wrath, ego, greed and attachment. Uncontrollable expression of sexual lust, as in rape or sexual addiction, is an evil.\n\nThe spiritual teacher Meher Baba described the differences between lust and love:\nIn lust there is reliance upon the object of sense and consequent spiritual subordination of the soul to it, but love puts the soul into direct and co-ordinate relation with the reality which is behind the form. Therefore lust is experienced as being heavy and love is experienced as being light. In lust there is a narrowing down of life and in love there is an expansion in being...If you love the whole world you vicariously live in the whole world, but in lust there is an ebbing down of life and a general sense of hopeless dependence upon a form which is regarded as another. Thus, in lust there is the accentuation of separateness and suffering, but in love there is the feeling of unity and joy...\n\nMedieval prostitutes lived officially sanctioned in \"red light districts.\" In Ruth Mazo Karras' book \"Common Women\", she discusses the meaning of prostitution and how people thought the proper use of prostitutes by unmarried men helped contain male lust. Prostitution was thought of as having a beneficial effect by reducing the sexual frustration in the community.\n\nFrom Ovid to the works of \"les poètes maudits\", characters have always been faced with scenes of lechery, and long since has lust been a common motif in world literature. Many writers, such as Georges Bataille, Casanova and Prosper Mérimée, have written works wherein scenes at bordellos and other unseemly locales take place.\n\nBaudelaire, author of \"Les fleurs du mal\", had once remarked, in regard to the artist, that:\n\nThe most notable work to touch upon the sin of lust, and all of the Seven Deadly Sins, is Dante's \"la Divina Commedia\". Dante's criterion for lust was an \"excessive love of others,\" insofar as an excessive love for man would render one's love of God secondary.\n\nIn the first canticle of Dante's \"Inferno\", the lustful are punished by being continuously swept around in a whirlwind, which symbolizes their passions. The damned who are guilty of lust, like the two famous lovers, Paolo and Francesca, receive what they desired in their mortal lives, their passions never give them rest for all eternity. In \"Purgatorio\", of the selfsame work, the penitents choose to walk through flames in order to purge themselves of their lustful inclinations.\n\nThe link between love and lust has always been a problematic question in philosophy.\n\nSchopenhauer notes the misery which results from sexual relationships. According to him, this directly explains the sentiments of shame and sadness which tend to follow the act of sexual intercourse. For, he states, the only power that reigns is the inextinguishable desire to face, at any price, the blind love present in human existence without any consideration of the outcome. He estimates that a genius of his species is an industrial being who wants only to produce, and wants only to think. The theme of lust for Schopenhauer is thus to consider the horrors which will almost certainly follow the culmination of lust.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas defines the sin of Lust in questions 153 and 154 of his Summa Theologica. Aquinas says the sin of lust is of \"voluptuous emotions,\" and makes the point that sexual pleasures, \"unloosen the human spirit,\" and set aside right reason (Pg.191). Aquinas restricts lust's subject matter to physical desires specifically arising from sexual acts, but Aquinas does not assume all sex-acts are sinful. Sex is not a sin in marriage, because sex is the only way for humans to reproduce. If sex is used naturally and the end purpose is reproduction there is no sin. Aquinas says, \"if the end be good and if what is done is well-adapted to that, then no sin is present,\" (Pg.193). However, sex simply for the sake of pleasure is lustful and therefore, a sin. A man who uses his body for lechery wrongs the Lord.\n\nSex may have the attributes of being sinless; however, when a person seeks sex for pleasure, he or she is sinning with lust. Lust is best defined by its specific attribute of rape, adultery, wet dreams, seduction, unnatural vice, and simple fornication.\n\nWet dreams: St. Thomas Aquinas defined and discussed the topic of nocturnal emission, which occurs when one dreams of physical pleasure. Aquinas argues those who say that wet dreams are a sin and comparable to the actual experience of sex are wrong. Aquinas believes that such an action is sinless, for a dream is not under a person's control or free judgment. When one has a \"nocturnal orgasm,\" it is not a sin, but it can lead to sins (Pg. 227). Aquinas says that wet dreams come from a physical cause of inappropriate pictures within your imagination, a psychological cause when thinking of sex while you fall asleep and a demonical cause where by demons act upon the sleepers body, \"stirring the sleeper's imagination to bring about a orgasm,\" (Pg. 225). In the end, though, dreaming of lustful acts is not sinful. The \"mind's awareness is less hindered,\" as the sleeper lacks right reason; therefore, a person cannot be accountable for what they dream while sleeping, (Pg. 227).\n\nAdultery: One of the main forms of lust seen frequently during the Middle Ages was the sin of adultery. The sin of adultery occurs when a person is unfaithful to his or her spouse, hence \"invading of a bed not one's own,\" (Pg.235). Adultery is a special kind of ugliness and many difficulties arise from it. When a man enters the bed of a married woman it not only is a sin, but it \"wrongs the offspring,\" because the woman now calls into question the legitimacy of children. (Pg.235). If a wife has committed adultery before, then, her husband will question if all his wife's children are his offspring. \nSimple fornication: Simple fornication is having sex with one's wife for enjoyment rather than for bearing children. Fornication is also sex between two unmarried people, which is also a mortal sin. Aquinas says, \"fornication is a deadly crime,\" (Pg.213). Fornication is a mortal sin, but as Aquinas notes, \"Pope Gregory treated sins of the flesh as less grievous than those of the spirit\" (Pg. 217). Fornication was a grave sin such as that against property. Fornication, however, is not as grave as a sin directly against God and human life; therefore, murder is much worse than fornication. Property in this case means that a daughter is the property of her father, and if you do wrong to her, you then do wrong to him; therefore seducing a virgin or seeking pleasure from an unmarried woman is an invasion of a father's property.\n\nRape: Rape is a kind of lust that often coincides with seduction and is defined as a type of lechery. Rape comes with force and violence: Rape occurs when a person craves the pleasures of sex so intensely that he uses force to obtain it. Rape is committed when violence is used to seduce, or deflower a virgin. Rape harms both the unmarried girl and her father, because the girl is property of her father. Rape and seduction can be discussed together, because both sins involve the deflowering of a virgin; however, rape can happen without seduction, as when a man attacks a widow or a sexually experienced woman and violates her. Therefore, wherever violence accompanies sex, you have the quality of rape and the sin of lust.\n\nSeduction: Seduction is a type of lust, because seduction is a sex act, which ravishes a virgin. Lust is a sin of sexual activity, and, \"…a special quality of wrong that appears if a maid still under her father's care is debauched\" (Pg.229). Seduction involves a discussion of property, as an unmarried girl is property of her father. A virgin, even though free from the bond of marriage, is not free from the bond of her family. When a virgin is violated without a promise of engagement, she is prevented from having honorable marriage, which is shameful to herself and her family. A man who performs sexual acts with a virgin must \"endow her and have her to wife,\" and if the father, who is responsible for her, says no, then a man must pay a dowry to compensate for her loss of virginity and future chance of marriage. (Pg.229)\n\nUnnatural vice: Unnatural vice is the worst kind of lust because it is unnatural in act and purpose. Unnatural vice happens variously, but Aquinas provides several examples including bestiality or intercourse with a \"thing of another species,\" for example animals. Aquinas said, \"bestiality goes beyond the bands of humanity\" and is therefore, unnatural.\n\nBarry Long states that lusting is simply thinking or fantasising about an imagined sexual scene and private parts of the body. The action of thinking or fantasising stirs the natural, pure sexual energy into a coarser, more degraded emotional form (lust). Long encourages lovemaking as the practice of converting sexual energy into the knowledge of love: \"You don’t need a celibate body, you need a celibate mind\".\n\nLust, in the domain of psychoanalysis and psychology, is often treated as a case of \"heightened libido\".\n\nA person is more likely to lust after someone who does not resemble themself. Self-relatedness is a cue of kinship and causes an instinctual reaction to not be attracted. Therefore, self-resemblance decreases attractiveness and sexual desire in a person, while less resemblance increases attractiveness and sexual desire, creating a higher possibility of lust.\n\n\n\n"}

He had a sister named Angelina (1912–1999).\n\nNikola's father separated from Joka after World War I and proceeded to get married three times. Nikola lived with his father at first so he attended school in places where his father served with the Serbian army. He eventually finished six grades of gymnasium before becoming a student of geodesy in Belgrade. During his studies, he met Borka (a year younger than him) who was born in Rajkovići near Valjevo in present-day Serbia into a family of old supporters of the People's Radical Party and Nikola Pašić. Borka and Nikola married in 1929 and on 3 August 1930 they had twins Mirjana and Milan. Their first service was in Belgrade. They then moved to Aranđelovac and finally back to Valjevo (where there are Kalabićs today). Nikola Kalabić (until the start of World War II) worked in Land-registry management in Valjevo.\n\nDuring World War II, Nikola Kalabić was commander of Draža Mihailović's elite formation named Mountain Guard Corps ().

{"id": "408309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=408309", "title": "Prayer circle", "text": "Prayer circle\n\nA prayer circles is most simply where participants join hands in a literal circle of prayer, often as part of a vigil. Informal prayer circles have been practiced for centuries. Their recent resurgence in popularity is frequently attributed to their use in the Catholic Charismatic Renewal movement. Similarly, amongst North American and specifically Native American Catholics, prayer circles have formed around Kateri Tekakwitha, who was the first Native American to be beatified by the Roman Catholic Church. Tekakwitha Conference prayer circles, called Kateri Prayer Circles, have been formed on nearly all U.S. Indian Reservations. In Islam, Muslims who make the pilgrimage to Mecca will form concentric circles around the Kaaba in prayer, and these too are commonly referred to as prayer circles.\n\nA prayer circle may also refer to some online communities where people share their thoughts and prayers with other like-minded worshippers, usually within specially-designated message board areas.\n\nRitual prayer in a circle around an altar is not unique to Christianity. Ritual ceremonies around an altar are common in paganism, and ritual prayer dances around an altar were practiced by early Christians, especially Gnostics, before the practice was condemned as a heresy by the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 A.D. (\"See\" Nibley, \"The Early Christian Prayer Circle\", page 41.) Much later, Protestants began conducting informal prayer circles. Sometimes these communities are developed online.\n\nWith the World Wide Web's rapid growth amongst all sectors of society, many Christians and other faith-based peoples have found a niche on the Internet where they can share their prayers, thoughts and wishes with each other. It is not known who was the first to set up an online prayer circle, but today there are dozens, if not hundreds, of Web sites set up for these purposes, from large-scale sites run by The American Bible Society and Beliefnet to smaller message boards run by community churches.\n\nAn online prayer circle is often a vigil set up by a participant in honor of someone close to that participant. Larger online prayer circles are also formed in honor and remembrance of the victims of notable disasters or tragedies. Though religious in tone, online prayer circles are generally non-denominational and at times are not even explicitly Christian.\n\nIn Mormonism, a prayer circle is a mode of prayer practiced by Mormons who have taken part in the endowment ceremony. Established by Joseph Smith in 1842 or 1843, he called it the \"True Order of Prayer\". The ritual involves an antiphonic recitation of prayer by participants joined in a circle, usually around an altar inside a temple. Earlier Mormons had practiced conventional Protestant-type prayer circles at least as early as 1833.\n\nIn The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the largest branch of the Latter Day Saint movement, prayer circles since 1978 are no longer practiced outside of temples, and Mormons do not take part in prayer circles except as part of an endowment ceremony.\n"}
{"id": "367519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367519", "title": "Prey (novel)", "text": "Prey (novel)\n\nPrey is a novel by Michael Crichton, first published in November 2002. An excerpt was published in the January–February 2003 issue of \"Seed\". Like \"Jurassic Park\", the novel serves as a cautionary tale about developments in science and technology; in this case, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, and distributed artificial intelligence.\n\nThe book features relatively new advances in the computing/scientific community, such as artificial life, emergence (and by extension, complexity), genetic algorithms, and agent-based computing. Fields such as population dynamics and host-parasite coevolution are also at the heart of the novel.\n\nFilm rights to the book were purchased by 20th Century Fox.\n\nThe novel is narrated by the protagonist Jack Forman, an unemployed software programmer who used to work for a company called Media Tronics but was fired and blackballed for discovering an internal scandal. As a result, he is forced to take the role of a house husband while his wife Julia serves as a high ranking executive at a nanorobotics company called Xymos. Julia claims that she is working on a new piece of revolutionary imaging technology with her company, which takes up most of her time and makes her grow distant to Jack and her family. He starts believing that during her long hours away from home she is having an affair and becomes watchful of her changes.\n\nOne night Julia comes home late and shows Jack a video of her demonstrating the Xymos nanobots. In the video, the nanobots are put into a human test subject, and video from inside the body is broadcast in real time. Jack is impressed but becomes more suspicious of her straying when he notices the video was not made on the same day as she said it was. \n\nLater in the night, their baby girl Amanda awakens in agony as her body turns red from an unknown cause. Jack takes her to the hospital, but the doctors cannot identify the cause of her pain. She is given an MRI for more examination, then suddenly her pain stops and the skin changes disappear. Bewildered and exhausted, Jack returns home to a strangely indifferent Julia who leaves in a hurry, claiming to go on an urgent business trip.\n\nStrange events happen that lead Jack to suspect something bigger is going on with Julia as their son Eric claims he saw \"silver men\" cleaning the house in the middle of the night, and Jack finds a strange device found underneath Amanda's bed that wasn't there before, memory chips on their son's electronic game console have turned to dust, Julia has not only become distant but has also become abusive to her family, and Julia was seen driving one night with an unidentifiable passenger in her car. On that same night, Julia is injured in a car crash, and Jack is recruited to consult at Xymos, because the project manager, Ricky - a good friend of Jack's and former colleague - is having software issues with the nanobots.\n\nJack is taken to the Xymos research facility in Nevada's Basin Desert, where he is given a tour of the lab, meets the programming team, and is shown a complicated machine used to make the nanobot assemblers from bacteria. Ricky refuses to show Jack the source code for the nanobots, and later Ricky claims that building contractors failed to properly install filters in a certain vent in the building. As a result, hazardous elements such as the assemblers, the bacteria, and the nanobots were blown into the desert, evolving and eventually forming autonomous swarms. These swarms appear to be clouds of solar-powered and self-sufficient nanobots, reproducing and evolving (necroevolution) rapidly. The swarms exhibit predatory behavior, attacking and killing animals in the wild, using code that Jack himself worked on. Most alarmingly, the swarms seem to possess rudimentary intelligence, the ability to quickly learn and to innovate. Jack also learns that Julia helped teach the swarms to improve their intelligence and become more benign, but they regressed when she left. The swarms tend to wander around the plant during the day but quickly leave when strong winds blow or night falls.\n\nThe nanoswarm kills a rabbit outside the complex, and Jack goes outside with Mae to inspect. They find that the rabbit died of suffocation resulting from the nanobots blocking its bronchial tubes. While Mae goes inside for equipment, Jack is attacked by the swarms. He barely manages to get through the airlock into the lab before falling unconscious from anaphylactic shock.\n\nPersuaded by Jack despite Ricky's protests, the team decides to destroy the swarm or else risk its reproducing exponentially and becoming a grey goo plague that could endanger humanity. They believe the swarm must have nested in the desert to reproduce. They attempt to find this nest by tagging the swarm with radioactive isotopes and following them back to their nest at night. Under the cover of a strong wind that forces the swarms to remain dormant, the team goes outside to a storage shack to find the isotopes and build a spray device. However, the wind dies down, and four swarms attack the shack and eventually kill David and Rosie. The rest of the team are forced to take shelter in the cars parked outside.\n\nThe swarms find a way to enter the cars, but not long before the wind picks up in speed again. Jack and Mae manage to escape to the lab, but Charley falls unconscious outside his car after spraying his swarm with the isotope. Bobby, Vince, and Ricky refuse to go outside and help Charley. Jack, dizzy and nauseous, goes back out again to save Charley as the swarms attack again. Using a motorbike found in David's car, Jack manages to get himself and the semi-conscious Charley to the safety of the airlock before Jack falls unconscious again.\n\nAs night falls, Jack, Mae, and Bobby set out to find the swarms. While searching for them, they discover that the swarms are moving the now deceased Rosie through the desert. The team is also shocked to discover that the swarms can replicate the physical features, perceptions, and motions of humans when they see the swarms form replicas of Ricky, David, and Rosie. \n\nThe group follows the body to find the swarms nesting in a cave. As some of the Ricky-swarms come out of the cave after them, a Xymos helicopter arrives and wards off the swarms using its powerful draft. Mae and Jack then venture into the cave and proceed to exterminate the swarms, their nest, and their organic assembly plant (which looks very similar to the original Xymos assembly plant) using explosive thermite caps. They return to the Xymos plant, exhausted.\n\nAt the plant, Jack, Mae, and Bobby are enthusiastically greeted by Julia, who had discharged herself from the hospital and was brought in by the chopper. Julia's behavior seems to be extremely aberrant; she seems to pay heed to nothing except trying to entice Jack and kissing him, even when Charley is found dead in the locked communications room with a swarm flying around him and the communication links cut. Jack cannot understand how the swarm got inside the rigorously protected airtight building, why Charley would have disabled the facility's communications, or why Julia and Ricky seem to be coming up with various out-of-character ways of how he died.\n\nMae discovers security footage of when they were in the desert. To Jack's horror, the video not only reveals that Julia and Ricky had an affair but also shows how Charley engaged in a vicious fight with Ricky and Vince. All of them end up in the communications room where Julia kisses a subdued Charley, injecting a stream of swarm into his mouth while Ricky sabotages the communication systems, and they leave Charley to die from the swarm.\n\nEventually, Jack and Mae realize that everyone in the facility except themselves have been infected by a symbiotic version of the nanobot swarms. These nanobots, although evolved alongside the other swarms, do not show aggressive predatory behavior. Instead, while they seem to invigorate their hosts' physical attributes and their emotional perceptions, the nanobots slowly devour and take over their hosts to produce more nanobots, and in the process affect their decision making and then the bots control them, while allowing them to travel and contaminate others.\n\nJack comes up with a plan to destroy this new strain. Mae and Jack drink vials containing a form of phage that kills the nanobot-producing \"E. coli\" bacteria and thus would protect them from infection by the nanobots. Jack then proceeds to take a sample of the phage and pour it into the sprinkler system and drench everyone with it. He has Mae alert Julia and the infected team. They set out to stop Jack. In the vicious struggle that ensues, Jack is captured and thrown into a magnetic chamber, with Ricky threatening him to either reveal his plan or be killed by the magnets. Jack feigns surrender when Julia walks in to interrogate him, but Jack then reactivates the magnetic chamber with Julia inside, remembering the incident with Amanda in the MRI. Julia's body disintegrates as a swarm is pulled away by the magnetic field to temporarily reveal the real Julia, who has slowly been consumed by the parasitic swarm. Before the swarm can repossess her body, Julia begs Jack to forgive her for putting him in danger, says she loves him, and tells him to stop the swarms and save their children from the same fate, as they have been infected too. Motivated, Jack runs to the roof, fights off the infected team, and finally manages to place the sample into the sprinkler system.\n\nIn order to prevent the sprinkler system from triggering, infected-Ricky disables the plant's safety network. However, this is exactly what Jack wants, as Mae has already allowed the phage into the assembly line, causing the phage to reproduce rapidly. The assembly line is rapidly overheating because of the de-activated safety system. If infected-Ricky and infected-Julia don't turn on the safety system the assembly line will burst, filling the lab with the phage. The infected-team, who are now doomed either way, choose to re-activate the safety network and get drenched with the phage. Jack and Mae escape the facility in a helicopter shortly before the facility explodes due to a methane gas leak combined with thermite Mae has placed in the building. \n\nAfter returning home, Jack doses his children and sister with the phage to eradicate the potential nanobot infestation. Mae calls the U.S. Army and sends a sample of the phage to her lab.\n\nJack puts together all the missing links. The corrosion of the memory chips in his home's electronics and Amanda's skin rash were caused by nanobot assemblers spread by infected-Julia. The MRI's strong magnetic field detached the assemblers from Amanda. Knowing this, Julia called in the Xymos special team to scan Amanda's room. The person whom Jack spotted in Julia's car was in fact the Ricky-swarm. Xymos had intentionally released the swarm into the desert so that it would evolve to stay in a cohesive group in the wind, but then they called him in to destroy the wild strain once it became uncontrollable.\n\n\n\nJim Holt, writing for \"The New York Times\", found the book \"absurd\" but exciting, and said that he \"kept turning the pages feverishly\".\n\nPeter Guttridge, writing for \"The Observer\", said that it finds Crichton \"doing what he does best\".

He was a two-time Olympian (1996 and 2000), and a top 16 finalist in the 100 m freestyle at his Olympic debut in Atlanta (1996). As a member of Ukraine's senior national team, Svanidze had won a total of 37 swimming titles in middle-distance freestyle (100 and 200 m), and in freestyle relays (400 and 800 m). Although he never received a single medal in any international tournament, Svanidze was regarded as one of Ukraine's top swimmers in the post-independence era since the break-up of the Soviet Union. Before his untimely death in 2002, he worked as a senior lecturer under the faculty of physical education in Zaporizhia State Medical University.\n\nSvanidze, a native in Tbilisi, Georgian SSR, started his sporting career at the age of nine. He later became a pupil and a member of the swimming team for Ukraïna Zaporizhzhia, one of Ukraine's top sports clubs, under his longtime coach and mentor Ivan Proskura.\n\nIn 1995, Svanidze made his worldwide breakthrough at the FINA Short Course World Championships in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he placed fifth in a freestyle double (100 and 200 m). He also established a new Ukrainian record of 1:48.73 in the 200 m freestyle.\n\nSvanidze became one of the first ever swimmers to attend Ukraine's historic debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta since the post-Soviet era. In the 100 m freestyle, he powered home with a fourteenth-place effort in the B-Final at 50.43, edging out Canada's Stephen Clarke in a close finish by two-hundredths of a second (0.02).\n\nAt the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Svanidze competed in three swimming events, including two freestyle relays. He posted a FINA B-standard entry time of 1:52.34 (200 m freestyle) from the European Championships in Helsinki, Finland. On the first day of the Games, Svanidze teamed up with Vyacheslav Shyrshov, Pavlo Khnykin, and Artem Honcharenko in the 4×100 m freestyle relay. Svanidze swam the second leg in heat three and recorded a split of 51.69, but the Ukrainians finished the race in fourth place and twelfth overall with a final time of 3:21.48. In the 200 m freestyle, Svanidze placed twenty-fourth on the morning prelims. Swimming in heat four, he picked up a second spot by almost a third of a second (0.33) behind winner Arūnas Savickas of Lithuania, in a time of 1:52.35. Two days later, Svanidze, along with Goncharenko, Ihor Snitko, and Serhiy Fesenko, placed fourteenth in the 4×200 m freestyle relay with a time of 7:32.16.\n\nShortly after his second Olympics, Svanidze announced his retirement from swimming. He worked as a full-time senior lecturer under the faculty of physical education, social pedagogy, and psychology at the Zaporizhia State Medical University in Zaporizhia.\n\nOn October 16, 2002, just three weeks before his thirty-first birthday, Svanidze was found unconscious inside the gymnasium at Zaporizhia State Medical University after having suffered a cardiac arrest. He started to become ill while conducting an evening training session for students. He responded to them: \"I have a headache; train? probably not; Go to class time, my fellow students\". While proceeding to the university's gymnasium, Svanidze felt bad, and eventually collapsed. He was found unconscious by one of his students, before being brought to the University's hospital. Eleven minutes later, he was pronounced dead. Doctors discovered that Svanidze had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, caused by a traumatic aortic rupture, at the time of his death.\n\nSvanidze's untimely death shocked the nation's entire swimming field. Olympic medalist Denys Sylantyev recalled his emotion for a posthumous swimmer: \"It feels like Rostislav just left. Somewhere far away. He and I have never competed, but we were very good friends. In matters of sport, I did not consult with him, because it is impossible to swim in different distances. None of us sought advice in real-life situations, but there is no request that he had not fulfilled. If you cannot do something, It is no longer a promise. We spent a lot of time in training camp, and more often, made fun of each other.\" \n\n"}
{"id": "49830950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49830950", "title": "SS Clifton", "text": "SS Clifton\n\nSS \"Clifton\", originally \"Samuel Mather\", was a whaleback lake freighter built in 1892 for service on the Great Lakes. She was long, beam, and depth, and had a 3,500 ton capacity. The self-propelled barge was built by the American Steel Barge Company in West Superior, Wisconsin. Her builders used a design well-suited to carry iron ore, her intended trade. The new vessel was christened \"Samuel Mather\", after a cofounder of Pickands Mather and Company, which at the time was the second largest fleet on the Great Lakes.\n\nAfter 31 years of service as an ore boat, the vessel was superannuated out of iron ore and was refitted as a carrier of stone aggregate. Her 1923–1924 refitting included the installation of topside self-unloading gear. The Smith-patented tunnel scrapers were intended to enable the ship to unload more quickly and to partially offload at ports that could not previously be serviced by ship. En route between Sturgeon Bay and Detroit on the night of September 21–22, 1924, while loaded with crushed stone, she encountered a storm and sank off Lake Huron's Thunder Bay Island with the loss of Captain Emmett Gallagher and the crew.\n\nAccording to one historian, \"Clifton\" became a \"ghost ship of the Great Lakes\", as there were no survivors and the events immediately leading up to the disaster were not known. The vessel's wreck was discovered on the bed of Lake Huron by technical divers in September 2016, with the discovery confirmed by further dives and research in 2017. When the lost vessel was rediscovered, it was found that a poetic folk ballad, written before 1932 by an Irish-American neighbor of the lost captain, contained a relatively accurate description of the ship's foundering.\n\nThe \"Clifton\" was built by the American Steel Barge Co. and launched in 1892. Designed by Captain Alexander McDougall, whalebacks had a unique form. Their unusual design included a hull that curved, which when fully loaded resembled a whale's back. They were the precursors of the turret deck ship of the late 19th and early 20th century, which like the whaleback had rounded hulls, but unlike the whaleback had conventional bows and sterns and a superstructure. A total of 44 whaleback vessels were constructed from 1887 to 1898, with most operating in the Great Lakes.\n\nAs \"Samuel Mather\", she was the second of seven U.S. merchant ships to bear that name. The eponymously-named \"Mather\", a/k/a \"Clifton\", was built at the personal expense of Samuel Mather, a cofounder of Pickands Mather and Company. For the better part of the twentieth century's first two decades, the company operated the second largest shipping fleet on the Great Lakes.\n\nAfter sailing for 31 years, she was deemed superannuated. The ship would no longer transport iron ore, and instead was retrofitted as a carrier of stone aggregate. This 1923–1924 refit included the installation of topside self-unloading gear, which affected her center of gravity and righting moment. As wreck discoverer David Trotter stated: \"We found that the self-unloading mechanism was still in position, and that was an interesting discovery because we now realize that the unloading mechanism didn’t break free, causing the Clifton to have instability, resulting in her sinking.\" The self-unloading machinery \"was added the same year she disappeared,\" responded maritime expert Valerie Van Heest. She said the discovery has many levels of significance. She said, \"All of it was additional weight above the center line of the vessel\", and that it was not coincidental that three other ships outfitted with an identical self-unloading system all sank. Four of the refitted ships were lost in relatively quick progression.\n\nAt the time of her loss, \"Clifton\" was owned by the Progress Steamship Co. of Cleveland, a subsidiary of Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc.\n\nIn \"Clifton\"s last position report as of 10:20 a.m. on September 21, 1924, it was entering Lake Huron near Mackinaw City approximately from where it ultimately foundered. As the gravel boat tried to make its way down Lake Huron toward its scheduled destination in Detroit on the night of September 21–22, a \"great storm swept [Lake] Huron\". In the opinion of an experienced skipper who had worked his way through the gale, no vessel of \"Clifton\"'s size could have survived in those conditions if she was out to sea.\n\nWreckage was widely scattered. Painted sticks of wreckage from the \"Clifton\" were recovered by \"Peter White\" on September 26, 1924, northeast of Pointe aux Barques Light, and a life raft was found on October 1, 1924. On the Detour, Michigan–Goderich, Ontario course, about away from the latter, hatch covers, and the forward end of a pilot house (with searchlight and clock attached) were recovered by the S.S. \"Glencairn\". The clock had stopped at 4:00, which is hypothesized to have been 4:00 a.m. on September 22, when storm waters on Lake Huron were at their height. A cabin door was found in the vicinity of Thunder Bay. United States Army Air Service airplanes were dispatched from Mount Clemens, Michigan, to conduct a search in Saginaw Bay in the vicinity of Tawas City, Michigan. Debris started washing up on the Canadian shore.\n\nNo bodies were recovered, implying that the sinking was quick without deployment of lifeboats. No mechanical malfunction has yet been discovered or any other definite cause of her sinking. Speculation at the time, which continued to be published decades after the tragedy, was that the newly-installed self-unloading gear could have broken free and contributed to the vessel's metacentric instability. However, after the discovery of the wreck it is now theorized that the vessel was overwhelmed by a wave or waves that drove it under power to the bottom. The obliteration of the first of the bow is testament to the blunt force the ship endured. \"The bow of the Clifton sustained heavy damage\", said Trotter, after having seen footage shot by the divers. “The first 40 feet of the bow section is completely destroyed, likely caused by the impact with the lake’s bottom when she sank.\"\n\nThree of the men lost with the ship, including captain Emmett Gallagher, were from the maritime community of Beaver Island, Michigan. The island community, which at the time was predominantly Irish-American, maintained the tradition of generating a folk-song lament for persons who were seen as having laid down their lives with heroism, and a ballad was written in honor of Captain Gallagher and the crew of \"Clifton\".\n\nAttributed to islander Frank McCauley and collected by a folklore researcher in 1932, \"The Seaman's Lament\" purports to tell the story of the lost captain and crew. Lines 23 through 26 of the lament are of particular interest, as they set forth a hypothesis that the doomed vessel was slewed by a series of waves, an action equivalent to broaching on a sailing ship. Once slewed, the cargo vessel was swamped and then foundered.\n\n<poem>\nAnd the mad billows leap like wild beasts from their lair,\nAnd in their wild rush not a life will they spare!\nAnd as they roll on over that structure of steel,\nThe steamer does tremble from foretop to keel. \n</poem>\n\nThese lines proved to be significant when the vessel was found, as they matched the physical condition of the hull on the lake bottom.\n\nEver since the 1924 sinking, the wreck was considered an ultimate goal for wreck hunters, partly because of its confounding disappearance, and partly because it was the only remaining whaleback to have sunk in Lake Huron and not be found. Exacerbating the problem was the sheer size of Lake Huron and potential ship gravesites. The lake has about with over on the United States side. The data on potential sites was obscure and very oblique, leaving widely scattered possibilities.\n\nDavid Trotter, a shipwreck author, discoverer, deep diver, and maritime archeologist, told the press that the lost vessel had been on his \"bucket list\", ranking close to #1 among non-found Great Lakes shipwrecks. At the time of the discovery, Trotter had found over 60 previously undiscovered wrecks while diving over the last 40 years. Some of his discoveries include sidewheel steamer \"Keystone State\" (1861 sinking with all hands); four-masted schooner, \"Minnedosa\" (1905 with all hands); and the \"Hydrus\", lost with all hands in the 1913 Great Storm on Lake Huron.\n\nTrotter started his search for \"Clifton\" in 1987. Almost 30 years later, in June 2016, he and his team logged the coordinates of an unknown wreck. He stated that they had been working on a project that involved two other wrecks. The team dived the unknown lost vessel in September 2016, and when the diver surfaced, he reported to Trotter that the unidentified vessel was \"a whaleback\". Trotter instantly told his crew that they might well have discovered \"Clifton\", as it was the only as-yet-undiscovered whaleback to have been lost on Lake Huron. The senior diver wanted additional confirmation of this discovery before making it public. After deputizing several team members with action cameras, it was clear that the wreck was indeed a whaleback and was therefore \"Clifton\". Trotter's divers further explored and video-documented the wreck, making nine dives in July–August 2017. Careful work was necessary, as the long-lost hull had been found approximately 100 miles (160 km) from where she had been last seen and was believed to have sunk. Trotter made the identification public in September 2017. The delay made it possible for the news to be formally released on September 21, 2017, the 93rd anniversary of the vessel's last surface sighting. Trotter said that the discovery was \"a personal milestone\" in a quest that he was fortunate enough to complete within his lifetime.\n\nTrotter told the press that \"Clifton\" propeller is intact and its rudder pointing straight. Both data points suggest the vessel was moving in a straight line when it sank. Now, \"she lies heavily on her port side, [indicating] that she got caught broadside by a very large wave\". These factors of the discovery tend to support the McCauley hypothesis of the sinking, as opposed to speculation that the vessel's self-unloading gear had broken its rigging and was swinging from side to side. The hull rests at a 45-degree angle to the lake bottom, consistent with being broadsided by a large wave.\n\nThe 26 members of the lost crew, in rank order with home town as listed by the Progress Steamship company, Cleveland, owners of the boat:\nThe disaster has been memorialized by Frank McCauley's poetic lament. In addition, marine historian and maritime artist Robert McGreevy rendered a drawing of the \"Clifton\" \"fighting for her life\" before she sank in the storm, and another of her resting on the bottom.\n\nThe sinking has been likened to the losses of \"Edmund Fitzgerald\", \"Carl D. Bradley\", and \"Daniel J. Morrell\".\n\nDwight Boyer discussed the 1882 foundering of the SS \"Asia\", the 1924 vanishing of the whaleback SS Clifton with all hands, the 1927 disappearance of the package freighter SS \"Kamloops\", and the 1929 foundering of the car ferry SS \"Milwaukee\", in \"Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes\" (1968), and retold an account of the 1975 disappearance of the SS \"Edmund Fitzgerald\" in his last book, \"Ships and Men of the Great Lakes\" (1977).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48925", "title": "Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester", "text": "Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester\n\nSimon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester ( – 4 August 1265), sometimes referred to as Simon V de Montfort to distinguish him from his namesake relatives, was a nobleman of French origin and a member of the English peerage, who led the baronial opposition to the rule of King Henry III of England, culminating in the Second Barons' War. Following his initial victories over royal forces, he became \"de facto\" ruler of the country, and played a major role in the constitutional development of England.\n\nDuring his rule, Montfort called two famous parliaments. The first stripped the King of unlimited authority, while the second included ordinary citizens from the towns. For this reason, Montfort is regarded today as one of the progenitors of modern parliamentary democracy. As Earl of Leicester he expelled Jews from the city; as he became ruler of England he also cancelled debts owed to Jews through violent seizures of records. Events in London and Worcester, for instance, led to massacres. After a rule of just over a year, Montfort was killed by forces loyal to the King in the Battle of Evesham.\n\nMontfort was a younger son of Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, a French nobleman and crusader, and Alix de Montmorency. His paternal grandmother was Amicia de Beaumont, the senior co-heiress to the Earldom of Leicester and a large estate owned by her brother Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester, in England.\n\nWith the irrevocable loss of Normandy, King John refused to allow the elder Simon to succeed to the earldom of Leicester and instead placed the estates and title into the hands of Montfort senior's cousin Ranulf, the Earl of Chester. The elder Simon had also acquired vast domains during the Albigensian Crusade, but was killed during the Siege of Toulouse in 1218 and his eldest son Amaury was not able to retain them. When Amaury was rebuffed in his attempt to get the earldom back, he agreed to allow his younger brother Simon to claim it in return for all family possessions in France.\n\nSimon arrived in England in 1229, with some education but no knowledge of English, and received a sympathetic hearing from King Henry, who was well-disposed towards foreigners speaking French, then the language of the English court. Henry was in no position to confront the powerful Earl of Chester, so Simon approached the older, childless man himself and convinced him to cede him the earldom. It would take another nine years before Henry formally invested him with the title Earl of Leicester.\n\nAs a younger son, Simon de Montfort attracted little public attention during his youth, and the date of birth remains unknown. He is first mentioned when his mother made a grant to him in 1217. As a boy, Montfort accompanied his parents during his father's campaigns against the Cathars. He was with his mother at the Siege of Toulouse in 1218, where his father died after being struck on the head by a stone pitched by a mangonel. In addition to Amaury, Simon had another older brother, Guy, who was killed at the siege of Castelnaudary in 1220. As a young man, Montfort probably took part in the Albigensian Crusades of the early 1220s. He and Amaury both took part in the Barons' Crusade.\n\nIn 1229 the two surviving brothers (Amaury and Simon) came to an arrangement with King Henry whereby Simon gave up his rights in France and Amaury gave up his rights in England. Thus freed from any allegiance to the King of France, Montfort successfully petitioned for the English inheritance, which he received the next year, although he did not take full possession for several years, and did not win formal recognition as Earl of Leicester until February 1239.\n\nMontfort became a favourite of King Henry III and even issued a charter as \"Earl of Leicester\" in 1236, despite having not yet been granted the title.\n\nIn that same year Simon tried to persuade Joan, Countess of Flanders to marry him. The idea of an alliance between the rich County of Flanders and a close associate of Henry III of England did not sit well with the French crown. The French Queen Dowager Blanche of Castile convinced Joan to marry Thomas II of Savoy instead.\n\nIn January 1238, Montfort married Eleanor of England, daughter of King John and Isabella of Angoulême and sister of King Henry III. While this marriage took place with the King's approval, the act itself was performed secretly and without consulting the great barons, as a marriage of such importance warranted. Eleanor had previously been married to William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, and she swore a vow of perpetual chastity upon his death, when she was sixteen, which she broke by marrying Montfort. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Edmund Rich, condemned the marriage for this reason. The English nobles protested the marriage of the King's sister to a foreigner of modest rank. Most notably, the King's and Eleanor's brother Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, rose up in revolt when he learned of the marriage. King Henry eventually bought off Richard with 6,000 marks and peace was restored.\n\nThe marriage brought the manor of Sutton Valence in Kent into Montfort's possession. Relations between King Henry and Montfort were cordial at first. Henry lent him his support when Montfort embarked for Rome in March 1238 to seek papal approval for his marriage. When Simon and Eleanor's first son was born in November 1238 (despite rumours, more than nine months after the wedding), he was baptised Henry in honour of his royal uncle. In February 1239, Montfort was finally invested with the Earldom of Leicester. He also acted as the king's counsellor and was one of the nine godfathers of Henry's eldest son, Prince Edward, who would inherit the throne and become Edward I (\"Longshanks\").\n\nAs Earl of Leicester, Montfort expelled the small Jewish community from the city in 1231, banishing them \"in my time or in the time of any of my heirs to the end of the world\". He justified his action as being \"for the good of my soul, and for the souls of my ancestors and successors\". His parents had shown a similar hostility to Jews in France, where his father was known for his devout Christianity, and his mother had given the Jews of Toulouse a choice of conversion or expulsion. Grosseteste, then Archdeacon of Leicester, may have prompted the expulsion however, Grosseteste appears to have been a restraining influence on the policy. Expelling the Jews enhanced Montfort's popularity in his new domains because it removed the practice of usury (widely associated with Jews).\n\nLeicester's Jews were allowed to move to the eastern suburbs, which were controlled by Montfort's great-aunt Margaret, Countess of Winchester, who had taken advice from Grosseteste. \n\nShortly after Prince Edward's birth, however, there was a falling out between the brothers-in-law. Simon owed a great sum of money to Thomas II of Savoy, uncle of Queen Eleanor, and named King Henry as security for his repayment. The King evidently had not approved this, and was enraged when he discovered that Montfort had used his name. On 9 August 1239, Henry is reported to have confronted Montfort, called him an excommunicant and threatened to imprison him in the Tower of London. \"You seduced my sister\", King Henry said, \"and when I discovered this, I gave her to you, against my will, to avoid scandal.\" Simon and Eleanor fled to France to escape Henry's wrath.\n\nHaving announced his intention to go on crusade two years before, Simon raised funds and travelled to the Holy Land during the Barons' Crusade, but does not seem to have faced combat there. He was part of the crusading host which, under Richard of Cornwall, negotiated the release of Christian prisoners including Simon's older brother Amaury. In autumn 1241, he left Syria and joined King Henry's campaign against King Louis IX in Poitou. The campaign was a failure, and an exasperated Montfort declared that Henry should be locked up like King Charles the Simple. Like his father, Simon was a soldier as well as a capable administrator. His dispute with King Henry came about due to the latter's determination to ignore the swelling discontent within the country, caused by a combination of factors, including famine and a sense among the English Barons that King Henry was too quick to dispense favour to his Poitevin relatives and Savoyard in-laws.\n\nIn 1248, Montfort again took the cross with the idea of following Louis IX of France to Egypt. But, at the repeated requests of King Henry, he gave up this project in order to act as the king's lieutenant in the Duchy of Aquitaine (Gascony). Bitter complaints were excited by the rigour with which Montfort suppressed the excesses of the Seigneurs and of contending factions in the great communes. Henry yielded to the outcry and instituted a formal inquiry into Simon's administration. Simon was formally acquitted on the charges of oppression, but his accounts were disputed by Henry and Simon retired to France in 1252. The nobles of France offered him the Regency of the kingdom, vacated by the death of Queen Blanche of Castile. The earl preferred to make his peace with Henry III, which he did in 1253, in obedience to the exhortations of the dying Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln. He helped the King deal with disaffection in Gascony, but their reconciliation was a hollow one. In the Parliament of 1254, Simon led the opposition in resisting a royal demand for a subsidy. In 1256–57, when the discontent of all classes was coming to a head, Montfort nominally adhered to the royal cause. He undertook, with Peter of Savoy, the Queen's uncle, the difficult task of extricating the King from the pledges which he had given to the Pope with reference to the Crown of Sicily; and Henry's writs of this date mention Montfort in friendly terms. But at the \"Mad Parliament\" of Oxford (1258) Montfort appeared with the Earl of Gloucester, at the head of the opposition. He was part of the Council of Fifteen who were to constitute the supreme board of control over the administration. The King's success in dividing the barons and in fostering a reaction, however, rendered such projects hopeless. In 1261, Henry revoked his assent to the Provisions of Oxford and Montfort, in despair, left the country.\n\nSimon de Montfort returned to England in 1263, at the invitation of the barons who were now convinced of the King's hostility to all reform and raised a rebellion with the avowed object of restoring the form of government which the Provisions had ordained. Cancellation of debts (owed to Jews) was part of his call to arms. \n\nThese \"cancellations\" involved massacres of Jews by his followers to obtain their financial records, for instance in Worcester and London. The Worcester attack and killings were led by de Montfort's son Henry and Robert Earl Ferrers. At London, one of his key followers John fitz John, led the attack and is said to have killed leading Jewish figures Isaac fil Aaron and Cok fil Abraham with his bare hands. He allegedly shared the loot with Montfort. 500 Jews died.\n\nHis son Simon led a further attack on Jews in Winchester. Jews in Canterbury, were murdered or driven out in by a force led by Gilbert de Clare There was further violence in Lincoln, Cambridge, Wilton and Northampton.\n\nEach attack was aimed at seizure of the records of debts, stored in locked chests within each community called 'archae'. Archae were legally mandated by the king for Jews to be allowed to conduct any business. They were destroyed or gathered for instance at Ely by the rebels.\n\nHenry quickly gave in and allowed Montfort to take control of the council. His son Edward, however, began using patronage and bribes to win over many of the barons. Their disruption of parliament in October led to a renewal of hostilities, which saw the royalists able to trap Simon in London. With few other options available, Montfort agreed to allow Louis IX of France to arbitrate their dispute. Simon was prevented from presenting his case to Louis directly on account of a broken leg, but little suspected that the King of France, known for his innate sense of justice, would completely annul the Provisions in his Mise of Amiens in January 1264. Civil war broke out almost immediately, with the royalists again able to confine the reformist army in London. In early May 1264, Simon marched out to give battle to the King and scored a spectacular triumph at the Battle of Lewes on 14 May 1264, capturing the King, Prince Edward, and Richard of Cornwall, Henry's brother and the titular King of Germany.\n\nMontfort announced after the Battle of Lewes that all debts owed to the Jews were cancelled, as he had promised.\n\nMontfort used his victory to set up a government based on the provisions first established at Oxford in 1258. Henry retained the title and authority of King, but all decisions and approval now rested with his council, led by Montfort and subject to consultation with parliament. His Great Parliament of 1265 (Montfort's Parliament) was a packed assembly to be sure, but it can hardly be supposed that the representation which he granted to the towns was intended to be a temporary expedient.\n\nMontfort sent his summons, in the King's name, to each county and to a select list of boroughs, asking each to send two representatives. This body was not the first elected parliament in England. In 1254, Henry was in Gascony and in need of money. He gave instructions for his regent, Queen Eleanor, to summon a parliament consisting of knights elected by their shires to ask for this 'aid'. Montfort, who was in that parliament, took the innovation further by including ordinary citizens from the boroughs, also elected, and it was from this period that parliamentary representation derives. The list of boroughs which had the right to elect a member grew slowly over the centuries as monarchs granted charters to more English towns. (The last charter was given to Newark in 1674.)\n\nThe right to vote in Parliamentary elections for county constituencies was uniform throughout the country, related to land ownership. In the Boroughs, the electoral franchise varied and individual boroughs had varying arrangements.\n\nThe reaction against Montfort's government was baronial rather than popular. The Welsh Marcher Lords were friends and allies of Prince Edward, and when he escaped in May 1265, they rallied around his opposition. The final nail was the defection of Gilbert de Clare, the Earl of Gloucester, the most powerful baron and Simon's ally at Lewes. Clare had grown resentful of Simon's fame and growing power. When he and his brother Thomas fell out with Simon's sons Henry, Simon, and Guy, they deserted the reforming cause and joined Edward.\n\nThough boosted by Welsh infantry sent by Montfort's ally Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Simon's forces were severely depleted. Prince Edward attacked his cousin, his godfather's son Simon's forces at Kenilworth, capturing more of Montfort's allies. Montfort himself had crossed the Severn with his army, intending to rendezvous with his son Simon. When he saw an army approaching at Evesham, Montfort initially thought it was his son's forces. It was, however, Edward's army flying the Montfort banners they had captured at Kenilworth. At that point, Simon realised he had been out-manoeuvred by Edward.\nAn ominous black cloud hung over the field of Evesham on 4 August 1265 as Montfort led his army in a desperate uphill charge against superior forces, described by one chronicler as the \"murder of Evesham, for battle it was none\". On hearing that his son Henry had been killed, Montfort replied, \"Then it is time to die.\" During the battle, a twelve-man squad of Edward's men had stalked the battlefield independent of Edward's main army, their sole aim being to find the earl and cut him down. Montfort was hemmed in; Roger Mortimer killed Montfort by stabbing him in the neck with a lance. Montfort's last words were said to have been \"Thank God\". Also slain with Montfort were other leaders of his movement, including Peter de Montfort and Hugh Despenser.\n\nMontfort's body was mutilated in a frenzy by the royalists. News reached the mayor and sheriffs of London that \"the head of the earl of Leicester ... was severed from his body, and his testicles cut off and hung on either side of his nose\"; and in such guise the head was sent to Wigmore Castle by Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer, as a gift to his wife, Maud. His hands and feet were also cut off and sent to diverse places to enemies of his as a great mark of dishonour to the deceased. Such remains as could be found were buried under the altar of Evesham Abbey by the canons. It was visited as holy ground by many commoners until King Henry caught wind of it. He declared that Montfort deserved no spot on holy ground and had his remains reburied under an insignificant tree. The remains of some of Montfort's soldiers who had fled the battlefield were found in the nearby village of Cleeve Prior.\n\nMontfort's niece, Margaret of England, later killed one of the soldiers responsible for his death, purposely or inadvertently.\n\nMatthew Paris reports that the Bishop of Lincoln, Robert Grosseteste, once said to Montfort's eldest son, Henry, \"My beloved child, both you and your father will meet your deaths on one day, and by one kind of death, but it will be in the name of justice and truth.\"\n\nIn the years that followed his death, Simon de Montfort's grave was frequently visited by pilgrims. Napoleon Bonaparte described Simon de Montfort as \"one of the greatest Englishmen\". Today, Montfort is mostly remembered as one of the fathers of representative government.\n\nMontfort bears responsibility for persecution of Jews. In addition to his expulsion of Jews from Leicester, his faction in the Second Baron's War initiated pogroms killing perhaps the majority of Jews in Worcester and around 500 in London. The violence and killings unleashed by the war targeting Jews carried on after his death. Leicester City Council made a formal statement in 2001 that \"rebuked De Montfort for his blatant anti-Semitism\".\nEvesham Abbey and the site of Montfort's grave were destroyed with the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. In 1965, a memorial of stone from Montfort-l'Amaury was laid on the site of the former altar by Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Harry Hylton-Foster and Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey.\n\nVarious local honours were dedicated to his memory, and he has become eponymous several times over. De Montfort University in Leicester is named after him, as is the nearby De Montfort Hall, a concert venue. A statue of Montfort is one of four to adorn the Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower in Leicester. A relief of Montfort adorns the wall of the Chamber of the United States House of Representatives.\n\nMontfort's banner called the 'Arms of Honour of Hinckley', blazoned \"party per pale indented argent and gules\", and displayed in stained glass in Chartres Cathedral, is especially used in the coat of arms of the town of Hinckley, part of his Earldom in Leicestershire, and by many of its local organizations. Combined with his personal Coat of Arms, the banner forms part of the club crest for the town's football club Hinckley A.F.C.\n\nA school and a bridge on the north east stretch of the A46 are named after him in Evesham.\n\nSimon de Montfort and Eleanor of England had seven children, many of whom were notable in their own right:\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

As CIGS he was committed to a Western Front strategy focusing on Germany and was against what he saw as peripheral operations on other fronts. While CIGS, Robertson had increasingly poor relations with David Lloyd George, Secretary of State for War and then Prime Minister, and threatened resignation at Lloyd George's attempt to subordinate the British forces to the French Commander-in-Chief, Robert Nivelle. In 1917 Robertson supported the continuation of the Third Ypres Offensive, at odds with Lloyd George's view that Britain's war effort ought to be focused on the other theatres until the arrival of sufficient US troops on the Western Front.\n\nRobertson was the first and only British Army soldier to rise from private soldier to field marshal.\n\nRobertson was born in Welbourn, Lincolnshire, the son of Thomas Charles Robertson, a tailor and postmaster of Scottish ancestry, and Ann Dexter Robertson (née Beet). He was educated at the local church school and as an older child earned 6d a week as a pupil-teacher. After leaving school in 1873 he became a garden boy in the village rectory, then in 1875 he became a footman in the Countess of Cardigan's household at Deene Park. He made no mention of this period in his life in his autobiography and seldom spoke of it, although during the First World War he is once said to have remarked to one of his aides: \"Boy – I was a damn bad footman.\"\n\nHe began his military career in November 1877 by enlisting for twelve years as a trooper in the 16th (The Queen's) Lancers. \nAs he was three months short of the official minimum age of eighteen, at the behest of the recruiting sergeant he declared his age as eighteen years and two months, these extra five months becoming his \"official\" age throughout his time in the Army. \nHis mother wrote to him in horror: \"You know you are the Great Hope of the Family...if you do not like Service you can do something else...there are plenty of things Steady Young Men can do when they can write and read as you can...(the Army) is a refuge for all idle people...I shall name it to no one for I am ashamed to think of it...I would rather bury you than see you in a red coat.\" On his first night in the Army he was so horrified by the rowdiness of the barrack room that he contemplated deserting, only to find that his civilian clothes, which had been parcelled up but not yet sent home, had already been stolen by another deserter.\n\nAs a young soldier Robertson was noted for his prowess at running, and for his voracious reading of military history. He won company first prizes for sword, lance and shooting. Among the young lieutenants under whom he served were future Lieutenant-General \"Jimmy\" Babington and \"Freddy\" Blair who would later be Robertson's Military Secretary at Eastern Command in 1918. He was promoted to lance-corporal in February 1879 and corporal in April 1879. As a corporal he was imprisoned for three weeks with his head shaven when a soldier under arrest, whom he was escorting, escaped near Waterloo Station. Later, whilst serving in Ireland, he once kept soldiers under arrest handcuffed for a twelve-hour train journey rather than risk a repetition of the event.\n\nHe was promoted to lance-sergeant in May 1881, and sergeant in January 1882. He obtained a first class certificate of education in 1883, while serving in Ireland. Robertson was promoted to troop sergeant major in March 1885, to fill a vacancy as his predecessor, a former medical student serving in the ranks, had been demoted for making a botch of the regimental accounts and later committed suicide.\n\nEncouraged by his officers, and the clergyman of his old parish, he passed an examination for an officer's commission and was posted as a second lieutenant in the 3rd Dragoon Guards on 27 June 1888. Normally only four or five rankers were commissioned each year at that time. \nRobertson later recorded that it would have been impossible to live as a cavalry subaltern in Britain, where £300 a year was needed in addition to the £120 official salary (approximately £30,000 and £12,000 at 2010 prices) to keep up the required lifestyle; he was reluctant to leave the cavalry, but his Regiment was deployed to India, where pay was higher and expenses lower than in the UK. Robertson's father made his uniforms and he economised by drinking water with meals and not smoking, as pipes were not permitted in the mess and he could not afford the cigars which officers were expected to smoke. Robertson supplemented his income by studying with native tutors while others slept during the hot afternoons, qualifying as an interpreter—for which officers received cash grants—in Urdu, Hindi, Persian, Pashto and Punjabi.\nPromoted to lieutenant on 1 March 1891, he saw his first active service in 1891, distinguishing himself as Railway Transport Officer for the expedition to Kohat. He was appointed an attaché in the Intelligence Branch of the Quartermaster-General's Department at Simla in India on 5 June 1892. There he became a protégé of Sir Henry Brackenbury, the new Military Member of the Viceroy's Council (i.e. equivalent to War Minister for India), who had been Director of Military Intelligence in London and was keen to beef up the intelligence branch of the Indian army, including mapping the Northwest Frontier. Robertson spent a year writing a long and detailed \"Gazetteer and Military Report on Afghanistan\". After five years in India he was granted his first long leave in 1893, only to find that his mother had died before he reached home.\n\nIn June 1894 he undertook a three month journey via Gilgit and mountainous north Kashmir, crossing the Darkot Pass at over 15,000 feet to reach the Pamirs Plateau at the foot of the Himalayas, returning to India in August by a westerly route via Chilas and Khagan. On the journey he learned Gurkhali from a Gurkha, later qualifying in this, his sixth Indian language.\n\nHe was promoted to captain on 3 April 1895. He took part in the Chitral Expedition as Brigade Intelligence Officer to the force which marched through the Malakand Pass (he was present at the Siege of Malakand (3 April 1895)), across the Swat River, via Dir to Chitral. He was described by Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Low, the Expedition Commander, as a \"very active and intelligent officer of exceptional promise\". After the relief of Chitral and installation of Shuja-ul-Mulk as Mehtar, Robertson was engaged in pacification and reconnaissance duties, but was wounded when attacked by his two guides on a narrow mountain path during a reconnaissance. One guide was armed with a shotgun and fired at Robertson but missed. The other guide attacked him with Robertson's own sword (which he had been carrying, as Robertson had dysentery) but Robertson punched him to the ground then drove off both attackers with his revolver; one was wounded and later captured and executed. The incident was reported and illustrated in the \"Daily Graphic\" and Robertson was awarded the DSO, which was, he later recorded, \"then a rather rare decoration\".\n\nRobertson then applied to attend Staff College at Camberley. Unlike most applicants, he could not afford to take extended leave from his job (on the intelligence staff at Simla) to attend a crammer, and had he failed he would have been too old to apply again, so he rose between 4 and 5 am each day to study mathematics, German, and French with the assistance of his wife. He later qualified as an interpreter in French. He just missed a place, but was given a nominated place on the recommendation of Sir George White (Commander-in-Chief, India). In 1897, accompanied by his wife and baby son, he became the first former ranker to go there.\n\nUnder George Henderson he absorbed the principles, derived from Jomini, Clausewitz, and Edward Hamley's \"Operations of War\" (1866), of concentration of physical and moral force and the destruction of the main enemy army. He passed out second from Staff College in December 1898 and was then seconded for service in the Intelligence Department at the War Office on 1 April 1899. As a staff captain he was the junior of two officers in the Colonial (later renamed Imperial) section.\n\nWith the start of the Second Boer War, Robertson was appointed as Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General to Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts, the British Commander-in-Chief South Africa, on 15 January 1900. He was present at the Battle of Paardeberg (17–26 February 1900), the Battle of Poplar Grove (7 March 1900) and other battles in March and May. Robertson was promoted to major on 10 March 1900 and was mentioned in despatches on 2 April 1901.\n\nHe returned to the War Office in October 1900 and on 29 November 1900 was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel for his services in South Africa. On 1 October 1901 he was appointed Assistant Quartermaster-General with specific responsibility for the Foreign Military Intelligence section, on the recommendation of the Intelligence expert General Sir Henry Brackenbury, and worked closely with William Nicholson (then Director of Military Operations). Although Robertson was later to be a staunch advocate of Britain's concentration of effort on the Western Front, in March 1902 (before the \"Entente Cordiale\") he wrote a paper (\"Treaty Obligations of the British Empire\") recommending that, in the event of Belgian neutrality being violated by France or Germany in any future war, Britain should concentrate on naval warfare and deploy no more troops to Belgium than was needed to \"afford ocular [visible] proof of our share in the war.\" His suggestion did not meet with approval at the highest political level: Foreign Secretary Lord Lansdowne commented that British policy had always been to deploy a small force immediately and (as had been done in the Boer War) a corps as soon as mobilisation was complete, whilst Lord Salisbury, then in his final months as Prime Minister, commented that he disapproved of such \"meditations\".\n\nRobertson was promoted to brevet colonel on 29 November 1903. Having been one of the oldest lieutenants in the army, he was now one of the youngest colonels, heading a staff of nine officers (divided into Imperial, Foreign and Special sections). In the later words of a contemporary, Robertson \"became rated as a superman, and only key appointments were considered good enough for him.\"\n\nRobertson was made Assistant Director of Military Operations under James Grierson and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 30 June 1905. In spring 1905, during the First Moroccan Crisis, Grierson and Robertson conducted a war game based on a German march through Belgium, Robertson commanding the German forces. They were persuaded that early and strong British intervention – it was assumed that British forces would land at Antwerp – was necessary to slow the German advance and avoid French defeat. In 1906 they toured the Charleroi to Namur area with the French liaison officer Victor Huguet. In 1906 Robertson also toured the Balkans, where he was impressed by the size of the mountains, a factor which was later to influence his scepticism about the Salonika Front during World War I.\n\nWhen that job expired in January 1907 Robertson, without a post, was placed on so-called half pay. In fact his salary dropped from £800 to £300, causing him severe financial difficulty, and he earned money by translating German and Austro-Hungarian military manuals into English, again assisted by his wife. He became Assistant Quartermaster-General at Headquarters Aldershot Command on 21 May 1907 and then brigadier general (equivalent to the modern rank of brigadier) on the General Staff at Headquarters Aldershot Command on 29 November 1907. He had hoped for command of a brigade. In 1909 he reconnoitred the likely route of a German invasion – Belgium, the Meuse and Luxembourg – with Smith-Dorrien and Rawlinson.\n\nDuring Brigadier General (later Field Marshal Sir) Henry Wilson's tenure as Commandant at Staff College, Camberley (1906–10) Robertson had lectured on Belgium, the Canadian frontier and the Balkans.\n\nRobertson's patron Nicholson, now Chief of the Imperial General Staff, appointed him Commandant at Staff College, effective 1 August 1910. However, Nicholson had initially (according to Wilson) opposed Robertson \"because of want of breeding\", while Wilson also opposed Robertson's appointment, perhaps feeling that Robertson's lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining. Robertson thought the Camberley job \"greatly underpaid\". He wrote to his friend Godley of a \"pestilential circle\" in top appointments which left \"no chance for the ordinary man\" and that the combination of Wilson as Director of Military Operations at the War Office (a job which Robertson may well have coveted for himself), Ewart as Adjutant-General and Stopford as Commandant of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, was \"enough to make one sick\". On 28 July 1910, shortly before taking up his new position, Robertson visited Camberley with Kitchener, who criticised Wilson. Relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter, beginning a rivalry which was to feature throughout the Great War.\n\nRobertson was a practical lecturer at Camberley whose teaching included withdrawals as well as advances. Edmonds, who had been Robertson's classmate in the 1890s, said he was a better lecturer than even Henderson. He taught officers that they \"were at the Staff College to learn Staff Duties and to qualify for Staff Captain, not to talk irresponsible trash\" about \"subjects of policy or strategy\". These and a number of similar recollections, written up after the Great War, may exaggerate the differences in style between Robertson and Wilson.\n\nHe was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on 16 July 1910 and promoted to major-general on 26 December 1910. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on 26 September 1913; on being knighted he mistakenly rose and shook the King's proffered hand instead of kissing it as required by protocol. The King was privately amused and the two men soon formed a good relationship. He was appointed Director of Military Training at the War Office on 9 October 1913.\n\nEarly in 1914, at an exercise at Staff College, Robertson, acted as Exercise Director, while Wilson acted as chief of staff. Edmonds later wrote that he said to French in a stage whisper \"if you go to war with that operations staff, you are as good as beaten.\" Had war not broken out, French had promised him command of 1st Division at Aldershot in the summer of 1914, in succession to Samuel Lomax.\n\nWith the Cabinet apparently contemplating some kind of military action against the Ulster Volunteers, it was unclear whether the Director of Military Operations (responsible for operations abroad), the Adjutant-General (responsible for domestic aid to the civil power) or the Director of Military Training (DMT, responsible for home defence) was responsible for drawing up deployment plans. On the evening of 18 March Robertson, who had asked practical questions throughout, was told that it was his responsibility as DMT.\n\nAfter Hubert Gough and other officers had threatened to resign (see Curragh Incident), Robertson also supported Wilson in trying in vain to persuade French (CIGS) to warn the government that the Army would not move against Ulster. The affair led to hatred between senior officers and Liberal politicians. Robertson contemplated resigning, but unlike French and Wilson he emerged without any blot on his reputation.\n\nRobertson was expected to remain Director of Military Training on the outbreak of the First World War, or to become chief staff officer to the Home Defence Forces. Instead he replaced Murray (who was promoted to be BEF Chief of Staff) as Quartermaster General of the British Expeditionary Force (under Field Marshal French) from 5 August 1914.\n\nRobertson was concerned that the BEF was concentrating too far forward, and discussed a potential retreat with Major-General Robb, Inspector-General of Lines of Communication, as early as 22 August (the day before the Battle of Mons) when French and Wilson were still talking of advancing. He arranged supply dumps and contingency plans to draw supply from the Atlantic rather than the Belgian coast, all of which proved invaluable during the retreat from Mons. He became known as \"Old Any-Complaints?\" as this was his usual question when checking on troops at mealtimes. In Dan Todman's view, the excellent performance of BEF logistics in August 1914 contrasted favourably with the \"almost farcical\" performance of the BEF General Staff.\n\nRobertson \"felt deeply\" the loss of his close friend Colonel Freddy Kerr, who was killed by a shell while serving as GSO1 (chief of staff) to 2nd Division.\n\nRobertson was then promoted (over the head of Wilson who was already Sub Chief of Staff) Chief of Staff (CGS) of the BEF from 25 January 1915. Robertson had told Wilson (17 January) that he did not want the promotion as he \"could not manage Johnnie, who was sure to come to grief and carry him along with him\". (Wilson commented in his diary on the irony of both of the candidates for the job – they were in a car driving to church together at the time – protesting to one another that they did not want it.) Robertson later wrote that he had hesitated to accept the job, despite the higher pay and position, as he knew he was not French's first choice, but had put his duty first. He refused to have Wilson remain as Sub Chief. French was soon impressed by Robertson's \"sense and soundness\" as CGS. Wilson continued to advise French closely whereas Robertson took his meals in a separate mess. Robertson preferred this, and in common with many other senior BEF officers his relations with French deteriorated badly in 1915.\n\nRobertson improved the functioning of the staff at GHQ by separating Staff Duties and Intelligence out from Operations into separate sections, each headed by a Brigadier-General reporting to himself (previously, the Operations section had been something of a bottleneck, exacerbated by a personality clash between Murray and Harper).\n\nRobertson was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 18 February 1915.\n\nRobertson consistently urged strong commitment to the Western Front. He advised on 22 February that Balkan countries would act in their own interests, not those of Britain, and thought the naval attempt to force the Dardanelles \"a ridiculous farce\". He also advised French on 2 April 1915 that if the government did not make France the main theatre of operations they should stand on the defensive there.\n\nRobertson told Hankey on 1 June that Sir John French was \"always wanting to do reckless and impossible things\" and made similar remarks to Kitchener in July. When French visited London on 23 June to talk to Kitchener, Robertson remained behind as he could not be seen to argue with French in public. He advised on 25 June 1915 against retreat to the Channel Ports, an option contemplated by the Cabinet after the defensive losses at Second Ypres, arguing that it would leave the British \"helpless spectators\" in France's defeat, and on 26 June, in response to a Churchill memorandum, that attacks on entrenched positions at Gallipoli had been just as costly as on the Western Front, but without the chance of defeating the German army. In \"Notes on the Machinery of the Government for the Conduct of the War\" on 30 June 1915 he argued, in Clausewitzian terms, that the government should state its war aims, in this case, the liberation of Belgium and the destruction of German militarism, and then let the professionals achieve them.\n\nThe King had a \"long talk\" with Robertson on 1 July and was left convinced that French should be removed as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF. Attending a council of war in London in early July 1915, Robertson was asked at the end if he had any comments—he produced a map and delivered a 45-minute lecture, and when interrupted stood glaring at the minister. His presentation made a strong impression compared to the indecisiveness of the politicians and Kitchener.\n\nRobertson wrote to Kiggell (20 June 1915) that \"these Germans are dug in up to the neck, or concreted\" in \"one vast fortress\" ... \"attack on a narrow front & we are enfiladed at once\" ... \"attack on wide front is impossible because of insufficient ammunition to bombard and break down the defences\". Tactically, he urged \"slow attrition, by a slow and gradual advance on our part, each step being prepared by a predominant artillery fire and great expenditure of ammunition\" and stressed the importance of counterbattery work. He also (July 1915) advocated surprise, and realistic objectives to prevent attacking infantry outrunning their artillery cover and ragged lines becoming vulnerable to German counterattack. Maurice, who drafted many of Robertson's memos, had advised him (19 June 1915) that such attacks were best carried out in places where the Germans were, for political or strategic reasons, reluctant to retreat so were bound to take heavy losses. Robertson initially opposed the mooted Loos offensive, recommending (20 July) a more limited attack by Second Army to seize Messines-Wyndeschete ridge, and telling Sidney Clive (25 July) it would be \"throwing away thousands of lives in knocking our heads against a brick wall\". He tried to get Sir John \"in a better state of mind & not so ridiculously optimistic about a state of German collapse\", although he told a conference in July that he and Sir John French \"looked out above all things for optimists\".\n\nRobertson also advised (5 August) that Russia, then being driven out of Poland, might make peace without a wholehearted British commitment.\n\nRobertson complained to Wilson (29 July) that French \"chopped & changed every day & was quite hopeless\" and (12 August) was \"very sick with Sir J., he cannot manage him nor influence him\"; Wilson noted that relations between French and Robertson were breaking down, and suspected (correctly) that Robertson was blackening French's reputation by sending home documents which French had refused to read or sign. He wrote a memo to French (3 or 5 August) arguing that the volunteer New Armies should be committed to the Western Front, an idea to which Kitchener was only reluctantly coming round. French refused to read it, explaining that he was \"fully acquainted with the situation\", so Robertson sent it to the King's adviser Wigram anyway.\n\nRobertson was made a Grand Officer of the French Legion of Honour on 10 September 1915 and acted as Commander-in-Chief BEF when French was sick in September.\n\nRobertson later wrote in his memoirs that he was not close to Kitchener, having only ever served with him in South Africa. With Asquith's Coalition Government in danger of breaking up over conscription (which Robertson supported), he blamed Kitchener for the excessive influence which civilians like Churchill and Haldane had come to exert over strategy, allowing \"ad hoc\" campaigns to develop in Sinai, Mesopotamia and Salonika, and not asking the General Staff (whose chief James Wolfe-Murray was intimidated by Kitchener) to study the feasibility of any of these campaigns. Robertson had urged the King's adviser Stamfordham (probably June or July 1915) that a stronger General Staff was needed in London, otherwise \"disaster\" would ensue. By October 1915 Robertson had come to support greater coordination of plans with the French and was in increasingly close touch with Charles Callwell, who had been recalled from retirement to become Director of Military Operations.\n\nWhen the King toured the front (24 October) Haig told him that Robertson should go home and become CIGS, while Robertson told the King (27 October 1915) that Haig should replace French. He was promoted to permanent lieutenant general on 28 October 1915. Robertson clinched his claim as the future CIGS with a lengthy paper (actually written by Maurice, dated 8 November) \"The Conduct of the War\", arguing that all British efforts must be directed at the defeat of Germany. Robertson told Haig from London (15 November 1915), where he was seeing the King and Kitchener, \"the first thing is to get you in command\".\nFrench, finally forced to \"resign\" early in December 1915, recommended Robertson as his successor and Kitchener told Esher (4 December) that the government intended to appoint Robertson Commander-in-Chief, although to Esher's disappointment \"dear old R\" was not appointed. Robertson was willing to relinquish his claim if the job went to Haig, his senior and a front line commander since the start of the war. Conversely, Haig's inarticulacy may also have made him an unappealing choice as CIGS.\n\nKitchener and Asquith were agreed that Robertson should become CIGS, but Robertson refused to do this if Kitchener \"continued to be his own CIGS\", although given Kitchener's great prestige he wanted him not to resign but to be sidelined to an advisory role like the Prussian War Minister. Asquith asked the men to negotiate an agreement, which they did over the exchange of several draft documents at the Hotel de Crillon in Paris. Kitchener agreed that Robertson alone should present strategic advice to the Cabinet, with Kitchener responsible for recruiting and supplying the Army, and that the Secretary of State should sign orders jointly with the CIGS (Robertson had demanded that orders go out over his signature alone). Robertson became Chief of the Imperial General Staff on 23 December 1915, with a Royal Order in Council formalising Kitchener and Robertson's relative positions in January 1916.\n\nRobertson assumed his duties on 23 December 1915. He brought with him three able men from GHQ: Whigham (Robertson's Deputy), Maurice (Operations) and MacDonogh (Intelligence). Their replacements, especially Kiggell (the new CGS BEF), and Charteris (BEF Intelligence) were much less able than their predecessors, a fact which probably affected BEF performance over the next two years.\n\nAlthough Robertson's advice to abandon the Salonika bridgehead had been overruled at the Allied Chantilly Conference (6–8 December 1915), his first act as CIGS was to insist on the evacuation of the Cape Helles bridgehead, which the Royal Navy had wanted to retain as a base and which some (e.g. Balfour, Hankey) had wanted to retain for the sake of British prestige in the Middle East (abandonment of the other Gallipoli bridgehead at Suvla/Anzac, too narrow to defend against enemy artillery, had already been decided on 7 December).\n\nOn his first day as CIGS Robertson also demanded a defensive policy in Mesopotamia, with reinforcements drawn only from India – this was agreed on 29 February 1916, over the objections of Balfour and Lloyd George. Robertson also insisted that Mesopotamian operations (and eventually logistics as well) be brought under his control rather than that of the India Office. Townshend, besieged in Kut, was not initially thought to be in danger, but eventually surrendered in April 1916 after three failed relief attempts.\n\nAnother early act as CIGS (27 December 1915) was to press Kitchener for an extra 18 divisions for the BEF. Conscription of bachelors – for which Robertson lobbied – was enacted in early 1916.\n\nRobertson was a strong supporter of BEF commander Douglas Haig and was committed to a Western Front strategy focusing on Germany and was against what he saw as peripheral operations on other fronts.\n\nHaving seen politicians like Lloyd George and Churchill run rings around Kitchener, Robertson's policy was to present his professional advice and keep on repeating it, flatly refusing to enter into debate, arguing that the government should accept his advice or else find another adviser. However, Robertson reduced the government's freedom of action by cultivating the press, much of which argued that the professional leadership of Haig and Robertson was preferable to civilian interference which had led to disasters like Gallipoli and Kut. He was particularly close to H. A. Gwynne and Charles Repington, who worked for the Northcliffe Press until it ceased to support the generals late in 1917, and advised Haig to cultivate journalists also. Robertson communicated by secret letters and \"R\" telegrams to generals in the field, including Milne, whom he discouraged from offensive operations at Salonika, and Maude who may have \"consciously or unconsciously\" ignored his secret orders from Robertson not to attempt to take Baghdad.\n\nIn a 12 February 1916 paper Robertson urged that the Allies offer a separate peace to Turkey, or else offer Turkish territory to Bulgaria to encourage Bulgaria to make peace. In reply, Grey pointed out that Britain needed her continental allies more than they needed her, and Britain could not, e.g. by reneging on the promise that Russia could have Constantinople, risk them making a compromise peace which left Germany stronger on the continent.\n\nRobertson told the War Committee (22 February 1916) that the French desire to transfer more troops to Salonika showed a weakening in their resolve for trench warfare. He scorned the idea that it would bring Greece into the war on the Allied side, and at a late March 1916 conference argued with Briand (French Prime Minister) and Joffre, who thumped the table and shouted that Robertson was \"un homme terrible\".\n\nWith characteristic bluntness he said of an Italian officer (12 March 1916), who warned that his country might be invaded by Switzerland, \"I'd like to have kicked him in the stomach\".\n\nThe War Committee had only agreed (28 December 1915) with some reluctance to make preparations for the Western Front Offensive agreed at Chantilly, which Haig and Joffre agreed (14 February) should be on the Somme, although Robertson and the War Committee were not pleased at Joffre's suggestion that the British engage in \"wearing out\" attacks prior to the main offensive. For three months, against a backdrop of Russia planning to attack earlier than agreed, Italy reluctant to attack at all and the scaling-down of the planned French commitment because of Battle of Verdun, Robertson continued to urge the politicians to agree to the offensive. He increasingly believed that France was becoming exhausted and that Britain would carry an ever greater burden. After Robertson promised that Haig \"would not make a fool of himself\" (he told Repington that Haig was \"a shrewd Scot who would not do anything rash\"), the War Committee finally agreed (7 April).\n\nRobertson lobbied hard with politicians and the press for the extension of conscription. When the Cabinet finally authorised the Somme Offensive, Robertson had the Army Council make a statement in favour of conscripting married men. In the face of protests from Bonar Law that the government might break up, to be followed by a General Election (which he thought would be divisive, even though the Conservatives would probably win) and conscription brought in by martial law, Robertson refused to compromise and encouraged Dawson, editor of \"The Times\", to make his stance public. After poor relations between French and Kitchener had permitted civilian interference in strategy, Robertson was also determined to stand solid with Haig, telling him (26 April 1916) that they finally had the civilians \"into a corner & have the upper hand\".\n\nRobertson was contemptuous of the House Grey Memorandum (early 1916) and of President Woodrow Wilson's offer to mediate in May 1916. Robertson and Hankey were sent from the room on 24 May 1916 so the politicians could discuss the offer, and McKenna (Exchequer) later told Hankey that he, Asquith, Grey and Balfour, but not Bonar Law or Lloyd George, had been in favour of accepting because of \"the black financial outlook\". The plan was stopped when the entire Army Council, including Kitchener and Robertson, threatened to resign.\n\nAt first Robertson tried to limit information to the War Committee only to a summary of news, most of which had already appeared in the newspapers – this was stopped by Hankey (who called it \"really almost an insult to the intelligence of the War Committee\") and Lloyd George (22–3 May 1916) when it was discovered that Robertson had moved troops from Egypt and Britain to France with little reference to the War Committee. (Given the logistical difficulties, Robertson scoffed at suggestions that the Turks might invade Egypt, and by July, on his orders, Murray had shipped out 240,000 of the 300,000 British Empire troops in Egypt, including 9 infantry divisions, 3 independent infantry brigades and 9 heavy artillery batteries, most of them going to France, leaving him with 4 Territorial divisions and some mounted troops.) In late May Haig and Robertson also angered ministers by challenging their right to inquire into the shipping of animal fodder to France.\n\nRobertson told ministers (30 May) that \"Haig had no idea of any attempt to break through the German lines. It would only be a move to (rescue) the French\", although he was probably not aware of Haig's insistence, overruling Rawlinson's earlier plan, on bombarding deeper into the German defences in the hope of breaking through and \"fighting the enemy in the open\". Maurice later wrote (29 June) Haig \"does not mean to knock his head against a brick wall, and if he finds he is only making a bulge and meeting with heavy opposition he means to stop and consolidate and try somewhere else\".\n\nRobertson was promoted to permanent general on 3 June 1916.\n\nAt an Anglo-French conference at 10 Downing Street (9 June) Robertson finally succeeded in blocking a major offensive from Salonika. In response to French pleas that such an attack might bring Romania into the war, Lloyd George continued to lobby throughout July and August. Robertson's view was that Romania would come in as a result of Russian success, if any, and that peace with Bulgaria, although desirable to cut German-Turkish communications, was best sought by diplomatic means.\n\nRobertson lobbied hard – briefing against him to Stamfordham and \"The Times\" and the \"Morning Post\" – but in vain to prevent Lloyd George, who made no secret of his desire to use his control over military appointments to influence strategy, succeeding Kitchener as Secretary of State for War. Although Robertson retained the special powers he had been granted in December 1915, and Lord Derby, an ally of the soldiers, was appointed Under-Secretary, Robertson still wrote to Kiggell (26 June 1916) \"That d----d fellow L.G. is coming here I fear. I shall have an awful time.\"\n\nRobertson was clear that it would take more than one battle (28 December 1915, 1 January 1916) to defeat Germany, but like many British generals he overestimated the chances of success on the Somme, noting that Britain had more ammunition and big guns than before, that by attacking on a wide front of 20 miles or so, the attackers would not be subjected to enfilade German artillery fire (in the event this probably spread the artillery too thin, contributing to the disaster of 1 July) and that attrition would work in the Allies' favour as \"the Germans are approaching the limit of their resources\".\n\nAfterwards he wrote to Kiggell (5 July) stressing that \"the road to success lies through deliberation\" and that \"nothing is to be gained but very much is to be lost by trying to push on too rapidly\". He recommended \"concentration and not dispersion of artillery fire\" and \"the thing is to advance along a wide front, step by step to very limited and moderate objectives, and to forbid going beyond those objectives until all have been reached by the troops engaged\", and urging Kiggell \"not to show this letter to anyone\". He again wrote to Kiggell (26 July) urging him not let the Germans \"beat you in having the better manpower policy\".\n\nIt was rumoured that Robertson was angling for Haig's job in July, although there is no clear evidence that this was so. This was the month with the highest British casualties of the entire war, at a time when the German Verdun Offensive was already being scaled back. Haig was reluctant to send Robertson full weekly reports and Robertson complained that Haig's daily telegrams to him contained little more information than the daily press releases. \"Not exactly the letter of a CIGS! … He ought to take responsibility also!\" was Haig's comment on one such letter (29 July). F.E. Smith (1 August) circulated a paper by his friend Winston Churchill (then out of office), criticising the high losses and negligible gains of the Somme. Churchill argued that this would leave Germany freer to win victories elsewhere. Robertson issued a strong rebuttal the same day, arguing that Britain's losses were small compared to what France had suffered in previous years, that Germany had had to quadruple the number of her divisions on the Somme sector and that this had taken pressure off Verdun and contributed to the success of Russian and Italian offensives. After the Churchill memorandum, both Robertson and Esher wrote to Haig reminding him of how Robertson was covering Haig's back in London, Robertson reminding Haig of the need to give him \"the necessary data with which to reply to the swines\" (7 and 8 August).\n\nWith Allied offensives apparently making progress on all fronts in August, Robertson hoped that Germany might sue for peace at any time and urged the government to pay more attention to drawing up war aims, lest Britain get a raw deal in the face of collusion between France and Russia, whom Robertson also regarded as long-term threats to Britain (as indeed they had been until the early 1900s). Prompted by Asquith, Robertson submitted a memorandum on war aims (31 August). He wanted Germany preserved as a major power as a block to Russian influence, possibly gaining Austria to compensate for the loss of her colonies, Alsace-Lorraine and her North Sea and Baltic ports (including the Kiel Canal).\n\nRobertson was initially unimpressed by the appointment (20 August) of Hindenburg as German Chief of Staff, and he knew little about Ludendorff.\n\nRobertson correctly guessed that the Bulgarian declaration of war on Romania (1 September) indicated that they had been promised German aid. While Lloyd George, who wanted Greece to be brought into the war on the Allied side, if necessary by a naval bombardment, was visiting the Western Front Robertson persuaded the War Committee (12 September) that Romania was best helped by renewed attacks on the Somme.\n\nRobertson had told Monro, the new Commander-in-Chief India, to \"keep up a good show\" (1 August 1916) in Mesopotamia but wanted to retreat from Kut to Amara rather than make any further attempt to take Baghdad, but this was overruled by Curzon and Chamberlain on the War Committee, which authorised Maude to attack (18 September 1916).\n\nLloyd George criticised Haig to Foch on a visit to the Western Front in September, and proposed sending Robertson on a mission to persuade Russia to make the maximum possible effort. With Royal backing, and despite Lloyd George offering to go himself, Robertson refused to go, later writing to Haig that it had been an excuse for Lloyd George to \"become top dog\" and \"have his wicked way\". Lloyd George continued to demand, in the teeth of Robertson's objections, that aid be sent to help Romania, eventually demanding (9 October) that 8 British divisions be sent to Salonika. This was logistically impossible, but to Robertson's anger the War Committee instructed him to consult Joffre. Derby dissuaded him from resigning the next day, but instead he wrote a long letter to Lloyd George (11 October) complaining that Lloyd George was offering strategic advice contrary to his own and seeking the advice of a foreign general, and threatening to resign if his advice was not followed. That same day Northcliffe stormed into Lloyd George's office to threaten him (he was unavailable) and the Secretary of State also received a warning letter from Gwynne, who had earlier been highly critical of his interview with Foch. Lloyd George had to give his \"word of honour\" to Asquith that he had complete confidence in Haig and Robertson and thought them irreplaceable. However, he wrote to Robertson wanting to know how their differences had been leaked to the press (although he affected to believe that Robertson had not personally \"authorised such a breach of confidence & discipline\") and asserting his right to express his opinions about strategy. The Army Council went on record forbidding unauthorised press contacts, although that did nothing to stop War Office leaks.\n\nAt the inter-Allied conference at Boulogne (20 October) Asquith supported Robertson in opposing major offensives at Salonika, although Britain had to agree to send a second British division, rather than be the only Ally not to send reinforcements. Robertson wrote to Repington (31 October 1916) \"If I were not in my present position I daresay I could find half a dozen different ways of rapidly winning this war. Being in the position I am and knowing what I know I find it not so easy...\". \nHe advised Hankey (31 October 1916) that further high casualties would be needed to defeat Germany's reserves.\n\nThe War Committee met (3 November 1916) without Robertson, so Lloyd George could, in Hankey's words \"air his views freely unhampered by the presence of that old dragon Robertson\". He complained that the Allies had not achieved any definite success, that the Germans had recovered the initiative, had conquered most of Romania, had increased her forces in the East (after increased mobilisation the German Army had increased in size from 169 ½ divisions on 1 June to 197 divisions (of which 70 were in the East, up from 47 ½ on 1 June)) and still had 4 million men in reserve. On this occasion Asquith backed him and the committee's conclusion, which was neither printed nor circulated, was that \"The offensive on the Somme, if continued next year, was not likely to lead to decisive results, and that the losses might make too heavy a drain on our resources having regard to the results to be anticipated.\" It was agreed to consider offensives in other theatres. The ministers again (7 November) discussed, after Robertson had left the room, the plan to send Robertson to a conference in Russia (all except possibly McKenna were in favour) and a further inter-Allied conference to upstage the forthcoming conference of generals at Chantilly. Robertson rejected the idea as \"the Kitchener dodge\" and was angry at the discussion behind his back and, concerned that Lloyd George wanted to \"play hanky panky\", refused to go.\n\nRobertson wanted industrial conscription, national service for men up the age of 55, and 900,000 new army recruits, similar to the new German Hindenburg Programme. He was concerned at the Asquith Coalition's lack of firm leadership, once likening the Cabinet to \"a committee of lunatics\", and although he avoided taking sides in party politics he urged the creation of a small War Committee which would simply give orders to the departmental ministers, and was concerned (letter to Hankey, 9 November) that ministers might be tempted to make peace or else to reduce Britain's Western Front commitment. Robertson gave an abusive response to the Lansdowne Memorandum (13 November 1916) (calling those who wanted to make peace \"cranks, cowards and philosophers … miserable members of society\").\n\nRobertson successfully lobbied Joffre and at the Chantilly Conference (15–16 November 1916) Joffre and Robertson (in Haig's view) \"crushed\" Lloyd George's proposal to send greater resources to Salonika.\n\nThe Somme ended on 18 November. There was already divergence between MacDonogh and Charteris as to the likelihood of German collapse. Robertson had written to Kiggell again (29 September) urging him not to raise expectations too high, and Robertson shocked ministers by forecasting that the war would not end until summer 1918, which proved a broadly accurate forecast. The War Office reported in November and December that the French had suffered much more favourable loss ratios than the British on the Somme, although they attributed better French artillery skills to the French artillery having only increased 2.5 times in size since the start of the war, whereas the British had increased tenfold.\n\nOn 21 November, after a discussion about manpower, Asquith again met ministers without Robertson present, and they agreed they could not order him to go to Russia. His influence was already beginning to wane. In the event departure, originally scheduled for November, was delayed until January and Wilson was sent in Robertson's place.\n\nAt the second Chantilly Conference it had been agreed that Britain would in future take a greater share of the war on the Western Front. Asquith had written to Robertson (21 November 1916) of the War Committee's unanimous approval of the desirability of capturing or rendering inoperable the submarine and destroyer bases at Ostend and Zeebrugge. Haig and Robertson had obtained Joffre's approval for a British Flanders Offensive, after wearing-out attacks by Britain and France.\n\nDuring the December political crisis Robertson advised Lloyd George to \"stick to it\" and form a three-man War Council, which would probably include the Foreign Secretary but not the First Lord of the Admiralty or the Secretary of State for War. He was suspected of briefing the press against Asquith, and had to assure the Palace that this was not so, and there is no evidence that he did. Had he not ousted Asquith, Lloyd George had planned to appeal to the country, his Military Secretary Colonel Arthur Lee having prepared a memo blaming Robertson and the General Staff for the loss of Serbia and Romania. Robertson warned the first meeting of the new 5-man War Cabinet (9 December) against the danger of \"sideshows\". By contrast Hankey (8 December), although he thought Western Front offensives inevitable, advised sending aid to Italy and offensives in Palestine – Lloyd George filed this with the Cabinet papers and used it as the blueprint of future strategy discussions.\n\nWith Murray's support, in the autumn of 1916 Robertson had resisted attempts to send as many as 4,000 men to Rabegh to help the nascent Arab Revolt, stressing that logistical support would bring the total up to 16,000 men, enough to prevent Murray's advance on El Arish. Robertson accused the ministers (8 December 1916) of \"attaching as much importance to a few scallywags in Arabia as I imagine they did to the German attack on Ypres two years ago\", but for the first time ministers contemplated overruling him. Encouraged by hope that the Russians might advance to Mosul, removing any Turkish threat to Mesopotamia, Robertson authorised Maude to attack in December 1916.\n\nRobertson advised against accepting Germany's offer (12 December 1916) of a negotiated peace.\n\nDuring renewed talk of sending more troops to Salonika, Robertson was told not to attend a meeting on 23 December 1916.\n\nRobertson was appointed Aide-de-Camp General to the King on 15 January 1917 and was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 24 January 1917.\n\nFollowing a fractious Anglo-French conference in London (26–8 December) the War Cabinet (30 December) gave Lloyd George authority to \"conclude any arrangement\" at the forthcoming Rome conference. On the train to the Rome Conference Robertson formed a low opinion of the new French War Minister, Hubert Lyautey, correctly predicting that he would not last long in his job.\n\nAt the Rome Conference (5–6 January 1917) Lloyd George, advised by Hankey, proposed sending heavy guns to Italy with a view to defeating Austria-Hungary, possibly to be balanced by a transfer of Italian troops to Salonika. Robertson stressed that this was contrary to agreed policy and hinted that he might resign. Cadorna (Hankey suspected he had been \"got at by Robertson\") stressed the logistical difficulty of accepting the heavy guns, even when Lloyd George removed the precondition that they be returned to the Western Front by May, and even Albert Thomas (French Minister of Munitions) thought it unwise to remove the guns from the Western Front. Robertson wrote to Lloyd George explicitly threatening to resign if he acted on Briand's impassioned plea to send more divisions to Salonika.\n\nA further Conference followed in London (15–16 January 1917). Cadorna was also once again talking of being able to win a major victory if reinforced by 300 heavy guns or 8 British divisions – Robertson predictably opposed this (29 January).\n\nHaig wanted to delay his attack until May to coincide with Italian and Russian attacks, but was told by the government to take over French line as requested, to live up to both the \"letter\" and \"spirit\" of the agreement with the new French Commander-in-Chief Nivelle, to be ready no later than 1 April, and not cause delays, almost certainly a result of private lobbying by Nivelle. Robertson was worried about Nivelle forcing the British to attack before the ground dried, although when Haig blamed the poor state of the railways (he demanded twice the railway requirements for half as many troops as the French), he inquired (28 January) whether Haig's staff had obtained an exaggerated figure by simply adding together the highest estimate of every subordinate formation. Haig demanded a meeting between British and French ministers to resolve matters, although Robertson urged him (14 February) to resolve them in a face-to-face meeting with Nivelle and keep the politicians out of it.\n\nRobertson later claimed that he attended the Calais Conference thinking it would be solely about railways, but this is probably untrue. Robertson was at the War Cabinet (20 February) – he told them that Haig and Nivelle were in complete agreement – which insisted on a conference to draw up a formal agreement about \"the operations of 1917\", and Robertson wrote to Haig (24 February) informing him of this.\n\nNeither Robertson nor Derby were invited to the War Cabinet on 24 February (no minutes were circulated, but on the train to Calais Hankey was instructed to draw up a summary to be circulated \"after\" the conference), at which ministers felt that the French generals and staff had shown themselves to be more skilful than the British, while politically Britain had to give wholehearted support to what would probably be the last major French effort of the war. Hankey also told Stamfordham that on the train to Calais Lloyd George had informed Robertson and Maurice that he had the authority of the War Cabinet \"to decide specifically between Generals Haig & Nivelle\", although the subordination of Haig to Nivelle had not been specifically discussed.\n\nAt Calais (26–7 February), after the railway experts had been sent away, at Lloyd George's request Nivelle produced rules governing the relations between the British and French armies, to be binding also on their successors. Nivelle was to exercise, through British staff at GQG, operational command (including control of logistics and food) of British forces, with Haig left in control only of discipline (which could not legally be placed in foreign hands) and forbidden to make direct contact with London. Haig, Spears later wrote, \"had become a cipher, and (his) units were to be dispersed at the will of the French command, like the Senegalese Regiments, like the Moroccans, like the Foreign Legion, until (his) massed thousands had become mere khaki pawns scattered among the sky-blue pawns\"\n\nThe plans were brought to Robertson, who feeling unwell had dined with Maurice in his room, at around 9pm. In Spears' famous account Robertson's face \"went the colour of mahogany … his eyebrows slanted outwards like a forest of bayonets held at the charge – in fact he showed every sign of having a fit\" He shouted \"Get 'Aig!\". Haig and Robertson visited Lloyd George – one of Robertson's objections was that the agreement could not be binding on Dominion troops – who told them that he had the authority of the War Cabinet and that, although Nivelle's demands were \"excessive\", they must have a scheme agreed by 8am. The next morning, after Nivelle had claimed he had not personally drawn up the scheme and professed astonishment that the British generals had not already been told of it, Robertson \"ramped up and down the room, talking about the horrible idea of putting \"the wonderful army\" under a Frenchman, swearing he would never serve under one, nor his son either, and that no-one could order him to\". Hankey drew up a compromise rather than see Haig and Robertson resign, with Haig still under Nivelle's orders but with tactical control of British forces and right of appeal to the War Cabinet. Robertson later (3 March) regretted even agreeing to this.\n\nRobertson wrote to Haig (28 February) that Lloyd George was \"an awful liar\" for claiming that the French had originated the proposal (the Prime Minister had in fact met Major Berthier de Sauvigny (15 February), a French liaison officer in London, telling him that Haig needed to be subordinated to Nivelle for the offensive and that if necessary he would be replaced), and that he lacked the \"honesty & truth\" to remain Prime Minister. Haig claimed (3 March) that with the BEF spread more thinly by having recently taken over line to the south, German forces (they had recently added 300 battalions by more intensive mobilisation, and by withdrawing to the Hindenburg Line would later free up an extra 15–20 divisions (135 -180 battalions)) might be used to attack at Ypres and cut him off from the Channel Ports. The French assumed Haig was inventing this threat (possibly true – in the summer of 1917 Haig's staff confessed to MacDonogh of playing up such a threat to avoid cooperating with the French).\n\nRobertson, who had been sick in bed, wrote to Haig (3 March) that he did not trust Nivelle. He continued to lobby the War Cabinet (\"it was very unpleasant to listen to\" wrote Spears) of the folly of leaving the British Army under French control, passing on Haig's demand that he keep control of the British reserves, and advising that intelligence reports suggested preparations for large-scale German troop movements in Eastern Belgium. With War Cabinet opinion having turned against Lloyd George – who was also rebuked by the King – Robertson also then submitted a memorandum stating that the Calais Agreement was not to be a permanent arrangement, along with a \"personal statement\" so critical of Lloyd George that he refused to have it included in the minutes.\n\nThe King and Esher also urged Haig and Robertson to come to an agreement with the government.\n\nAt another conference in London (12–13 March) Lloyd George expressed the government's full support for Haig and stressed that the BEF must not be \"mixed up with the French Army\", and Haig and Nivelle met with Robertson and Lyautey to settle their differences. The \"status quo ante\", by which British forces were allies rather than subordinates of the French, but Haig was expected to defer to French wishes as far as possible, was essentially restored.\n\nRobertson later came out to Beauvais in March 1917 to demand that Wilson keep him fully informed of all developments. On a visit to the Italian Front in March 1917 Robertson was unimpressed by the \"white faces and white hands\" of many Italian officers, which suggested that they spent too much time at headquarters and not enough time visiting the front lines.\n\nRobertson was sceptical of suggestions that Russia's war effort would be reinvigorated by the Fall of the Tsar, and recommended that Britain keep up the pressure on Germany by attacking on the Western Front. He thought the USA, which had declared war on Germany, would do little to help win the war. Even if President Wilson sent troops to Europe which was by no means certain, it would take until summer 1918 for 250,000 US troops to be available. Robertson prepared another General Staff appraisal (28 March 1917) stressing how the Allied position had deteriorated since the previous summer, and again recommending diplomatic efforts to detach Germany's allies, although he chose not to circulate it to the civilians. Germany had freed an extra 1.7m men for military service, and by the summer of 1917 the German Army would be an extra 1.25m men stronger, an extra 89 divisions (albeit reduced from 12 infantry battalions to 9).\n\nThe day after the Nivelle Offensive began, Robertson circulated another paper (17 April) warning that Nivelle would be sacked if he failed – which is indeed what happened – and urging the end of the Calais Agreement.\n\nRobertson was awarded the French Croix de guerre on 21 April 1917 and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus on 26 May 1917.\n\nLloyd George wanted to make the destruction of Turkey a major British war aim, and two days after taking office told Robertson that he wanted a major victory, preferably the capture of Jerusalem, to impress British public opinion. Robertson thought the capture of Beersheba should suffice as more divisions were needed to allow Haig to take over more line in France, although he told Murray (31 January 1917) he wanted him to launch a Palestine Offensive, to sustain public morale, in autumn and winter 1917, if the war was still going on then.\n\nA January 1917 paper, probably drafted by Macdonogh, argued that, with a compromise peace leaving Germany in control of the Balkans increasingly likely, Britain should protect her Empire by capturing Aleppo, which would make Turkey's hold on Palestine and Mesopotamia untenable. Aleppo could be more easily reached from Palestine than from Mesopotamia, provided Murray had 9–10 infantry divisions, and it was argued that the Turks would have problems assembling 100,000 men to defend it. This paper was much more optimistic than Robertson's later views, but at this stage Russia was still pinning down many Turkish troops. When consulted, the Admiralty were less enthused about suggestions that the Royal Navy assist with amphibious landings in Palestine. Except for this one \"very secret\" memorandum (sent to ministers 22 February 1917) Robertson tried to keep all his discussions of plans against the Turks verbal. It was agreed to build up Murray's forces to 6 infantry divisions and 2 mounted divisions by the autumn, as well 16 Imperial Camel Companies and possibly some Indian cavalry from France.\n\nWith Maude having taken Baghdad (11 March 1917), the Turks having withdrawn from Persia and been chased out of Medina by the Arabs, and Murray having made an apparently successful attack at Gaza (26 March), Robertson asked the War Cabinet (30 March) for permission to order Murray to renew his offensive. Initial reports turned out to have been exaggerated, and a subsequent attack (17–19 April 1917) also failed. This coincided with the failure of the Nivelle Offensive, reports of unrest among Russian troops after the February Revolution and an escalation of the U-Boat War (it was thought that loss of shipping might make Egypt untenable) causing Robertson to prefer a return to a defensive policy in the Middle East.\n\nAs Chief of Staff BEF Robertson had had Maurice, then Director of Military Operations at GHQ, prepare a study of an Ypres Offensive on 15 March 1915. The study had warned that the capture of Ostend and Zeebrugge \"would be a very difficult enterprise so far as the nature of the country is concerned\" and if successful \"would not materially improve the military situation of the Allies in the western theatre\" except in the unlikely event that it prompted a general German withdrawal – more likely it would leave the British defending a longer line supplied by only two lines of railway, at \"a grave disadvantage\" and \"in a rather dangerous position\" with their backs to the sea as the Germans counterattacked.\n\nBy 1917 Robertson was more keen on the idea of the Germans standing and fighting where they would suffer at the hands of strong British artillery. He wrote to Haig (20 April) cautioning against \"determination to push on regardless of loss\" and repeating Nivelle's error of trying too much to \"break the enemy's front\" and urged him instead to concentrate on \"inflicting heavier losses on (the enemy) than one suffers oneself\". It is unclear that the letter had much effect as Haig appointed Gough, an aggressive cavalryman, to command the Ypres Offensive shortly after receiving it.\n\nWith the Nivelle Offensive in its final stages, Lloyd George went to the Paris Summit authorised by the 1 May 1917 War Cabinet to \"press the French to continue the offensive\". Lloyd George was keen to build bridges with the generals and told them at Paris (3 May 1917) that he would back their plans (\"We must go on hitting and hitting with all our strength\") and stressed that they must choose the time and place of the next offensive. The next day Robertson stressed attrition with limited territorial objectives, while Hankey stressed the importance of Zeebrugge, where the Germans would suffer attrition if they stood and fought. Over dinner the Prime Minister reduced the company to \"fits of laughter\" with an impersonation of Robertson. Robertson thought Paris \"about the best Conference we have had\". With Russian commitment to the war wavering, Smuts, Milner and Curzon agreed with Robertson that Britain must attack in the west lest France or Italy be tempted to make a separate peace.\n\nPetain, committed to only limited attacks, became French Commander-in-Chief (15 May) and with Esher warning that the French government would not honour their Paris commitments, Robertson warned Haig that the British government would not take kindly to high casualties if Britain had to attack without wholehearted French support. Foch, now French chief of staff, also urged Robertson at a meeting (7 June 1917) to conduct only limited attacks (he opposed the planned Flanders Offensive) until the Americans sent more troops, and they discussed the possibility of attacks on Austria-Hungary designed to encourage her to make peace.\n\nRobertson and Haig met (9 June) after the victory at Messines. Robertson warned Haig that the government were diverting manpower into shipbuilding, ship crews and agriculture rather than the Army, and that a prolonged offensive would leave Britain \"without an Army\" by the autumn, and suggested that attacks against Austria-Hungary might be more prudent. Haig, dismayed, retorted that \"Great Britain must … win the war by herself\" and that the government were \"failing at the XIIth hour\". Haig also showed Robertson his \"Present Situation and Future Plans\" (dated 12 June) in which he argued that he had a good chance of clearing the Belgian Coast provided the Germans were unable to transfer reinforcements from the Eastern Front (in the event German reinforcements did not start to arrive in number until November), and that victory at Ypres \"might quite possibly lead to (German) collapse\". Robertson told Haig he disagreed with the statistical appendix (prepared by Charteris who was thought \"a dangerous fool\" in the War Office) showing German manpower near breaking point and refused to show it to the War Cabinet.\n\nThe political consensus of May had broken down. Lloyd George told the War Cabinet (8 June) he was dissatisfied with military advice so far and was setting up a War Policy Committee (himself, Curzon, Milner and Smuts) which held 16 meetings over the next six weeks. Smuts, newly appointed to the Imperial War Cabinet, recommended renewed western front attacks and a policy of attrition. He privately thought Robertson \"good but much too narrow & not adaptable enough\".\n\nRobertson objected to proposals to move 300 heavy guns and 12 divisions to Italy, secretly lobbying Foch, via Spears, in late June 1917. He also warned that the Germans could transfer forces to Italy easily, an attack on Trieste might leave Allied forces vulnerable to counterattack from the north, that Cadorna and his army were not competent, and conversely that they might even make peace if they succeeded in capturing Trieste.\n\nRobertson wrote to Haig (13 June) that \"there is trouble in the land just now\". He complained to him of the War Policy Committee's practice of interviewing key people individually to \"get at facts\" rather than simply setting policy and allowing Robertson and Jellicoe to decide on the military means, and that there would be \"trouble\" when they interviewed himself and Haig. He wrote that \"the (guns) will never go (to Italy) while I am CIGS\". He also urged him not to promise, on his forthcoming visit to London, that he could win the war that year but simply to say that his Flanders plan was the best plan, which Robertson agreed it was, so that the politicians would not \"dare\" overrule both men.\n\nHaig told the War Policy Committee (19 June, and contrary to Robertson's advice of six days earlier) that \"Germany was nearer her end than they seemed to think … Germany was within six months of the total exhaustion of her available manpower, \"if the fighting continues at its present intensity\"\" and (20 June) he had no \"intention of entering into a tremendous offensive involving heavy losses\" while Robertson wanted to avoid \"disproportionate loss\" (23 June). At this time Haig was involved in discussions as to whether Robertson should be appointed First Lord of the Admiralty (a ministerial post), and Woodward suggests that he may have felt that Robertson had outlived his usefulness as CIGS. Ministers were not entirely convinced by Jellicoe's warnings about German submarines and destroyers operating from the Belgian ports, but were influenced by France's decline (the opposite to Robertson's original view that this made a major offensive less sensible) and by the apparent success of the Kerensky Offensive. The Flanders Offensive was finally sanctioned by the War Policy Committee on 18 July and the War Cabinet two days later, on condition that it did not degenerate into a long-drawn out fight like the Somme.\n\nTo Haig's annoyance the War Cabinet had promised to monitor progress and casualties and, if necessary call a halt. Robertson arrived in France (22 July) to be handed a note from Kiggell, urging that the offensive continue to keep France from dropping out (even if Russia or Italy did). Over dinner Haig urged Robertson to \"be firmer and play the man; and, if need be, resign\" rather than submit to political interference and on his return Robertson wrote to Haig to assure him that he would always advise \"supporting wholeheartedly a plan which has once been approved\". Robertson met with Cadorna and Foch (24 July) prior to another inter-Allied conference at Paris, and they agreed that the current simultaneous offensives must take priority over Allied reinforcements for Italy, even though it was now clear that the Kerensky Offensive was failing disastrously and that Germany might sooner or later be able to redeploy divisions to the west.\n\nCurzon (12 May 1917) and Hankey (20 May) continued to urge that Britain seize land in the Middle East. Allenby, Murray's replacement, had been told by Lloyd George that his objective was \"Jerusalem before Christmas\" and that he had only to ask for reinforcements, but Robertson warned him that he must take into account the needs of other fronts for men and shipping. Allenby's exact remit was still undecided when he was appointed.\n\nAllenby arrived on 27 June 1917. Robertson (31 July) wanted him to keep active so as to prevent the Turks concentrating forces in Mesopotamia, although he scoffed at intelligence reports that the Germans might send as many as 160,000 men to that theatre. Allenby was eventually ordered to attack the Turks in southern Palestine, but the extent of his advance was not yet to be decided, advice which Robertson repeated in \"secret and personal\" notes (1 and 10 August).\n\nThird Ypres began on 31 July, with Haig claiming that German losses were double those of the British. Robertson asked Kiggell (2 August) for more information to share with ministers.\n\nAfter the Inter-Allied conference in London (6–8 August 1917), at which Lloyd George had urged the creation of a common Allied General Staff, Robertson again joined with Foch in claiming that there was not time to send heavy guns to Italy for a September offensive. Robertson wrote to Haig (9 August) that Lloyd George would \"put up (the useless) Foch against me as he did Nivelle against you in the Spring. He is a real bad 'un.\" Haig, at the urging of Whigham (Deputy CIGS), wrote to Robertson (13 August) congratulating him at the way he had \"supported the sound policy\" in London, but complaining that Macdonogh's \"pessimistic estimates\" of German losses might cause \"many in authority to take a pessimistic outlook\" whereas \"a contrary view, based on equally good information (sic), would go far to help the nation on to victory\".\n\nWith the offensive already bogged down in unseasonably early wet weather, French (14 August 1917) claimed to Riddell (managing director of the \"News of the World\", and likely to pass on French's views to Lloyd George) that Robertson was \"anxious to get the whole of the military power into his own hands, that he is a capable organiser but not a great soldier, and we are suffering from a lack of military genius\". Lloyd George suggested that all Robertson's plans be submitted to a committee of French, Wilson and one other, although Wilson thought this \"ridiculous and unworkable\".\n\nRobertson wrote to Haig (17 August) warning him of the shortage of manpower, and to \"scrape up all the men (he could) in France\". He also warned Haig that there were at that time less than 8,000 \"A1\" soldiers at home, and that Home Forces were largely made up of \"boys\" of eighteen whom Robertson, having a son only a few years older, thought too young for service in France. Haig had to tell his Army Commanders that the BEF would be 100,000 men under establishment by October.\n\nThe Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo began (18 August) and on 26 August the British Ambassador in Rome advised that there might be \"a complete smashing\" of the Austro-Hungarian Army. Robertson advised that it was \"false strategy\" to call off Third Ypres to send reinforcements to Italy, but after being summoned to George Riddell's home in Sussex, where he was served apple pudding (his favourite dish), agreed to send a message promising support to Cadorna, but only on condition Cadorna promised decisive victory. The Anglo-French leadership agreed in early September to send 100 heavy guns to Italy, 50 of them from the French Army on Haig's left, rather than the 300 which Lloyd George wanted.\n\nRobertson expressed his concern (15 September) that the heavy shelling necessary to break enemy defences at Ypres was destroying the ground.\n\nAs soon as the guns reached Italy Cadorna called off his offensive (21 September).\n\nRobertson felt that Lloyd George's proposal for an Anglo-French landing at Alexandretta would use up too much shipping and told the War Policy Committee (24 September) that he felt Allenby had enough resources to take Jerusalem, although he stressed the logistical difficulties of advancing 400 miles to Aleppo.\n\nBonar Law, having guessed from a recent talk with Robertson that he had little hope \"of anything coming of\" Third Ypres, wrote to Lloyd George that ministers must soon decide whether or not the offensive was to continue. Lloyd George travelled to Boulogne (25 September) where he broached with Painlevé the setting up of an Allied Supreme War Council and then making Foch generalissimo. On 26 September Lloyd George and Robertson met Haig to discuss the recent German peace feelers, one of which suggested she might give up her colonies, Belgium, Serbia and Alsace-Lorraine in return for keeping Poland and the Baltic States. Ministers were reluctant to accept this, but at the same time were concerned that Britain could not defeat Germany singlehandedly (in the event the peace feelers were publicly repudiated by Chancellor Michaelis, and Robertson again urged diplomatic efforts to encourage Bulgaria and Turkey to make peace, although the collapse of Russia made this less likely).\n\nHaig preferred to continue the offensive, encouraged by Plumer's recent successful attacks in dry weather at Menin Road (20 September) and Polygon Wood (26 September), and stating that the Germans were \"very worn out\". Robertson spoke to the Army Commanders, but declined Haig's offer that he do so without Haig present. He later regretted not having done so, although he was aware of the ill-feeling which Painlevé had caused when he asked Nivelle's subordinates to criticise him. He later wrote in his memoirs that \"I was not prepared to carry my doubts to the point of opposing (Haig)\" or of preventing one more push which might have \"convert(ed) an inconclusive battle into a decisive victory\".\n\nOn his return Robertson wrote Haig an equivocal letter (27 September) stating that he stuck to his advice to concentrate effort on the Western Front rather than Palestine out of instinct and lack of any alternative than from any convincing argument. He also wrote that \"Germany may be much nearer the end of her staying power than available evidence shows\" but that given French and Italian weakness it was \"not an easy business to see through the problem\".\n\nRobertson's refusal to advise a halt to Third Ypres cost him the support of Smuts and Milner. By the end of the year the Cabinet Committee on Manpower were hearing about an alarming rise in drunkenness, desertions and psychological disorders in the BEF, and reports of soldiers' returning from the front grumbling about \"the waste of life\" at Ypres, and even Haig himself writing (15 Dec, while arguing against a proposal that the BEF take over line from the French) that many of his divisions were \"much exhausted and much reduced in strength\".\n\nAt the War Policy Committee (3 October) in Robertson's absence, Lloyd George urged greater effort to advance into Syria with a view to knocking Turkey out of the war altogether, and the ministers decided to redeploy 2 divisions from France. Robertson angered the Prime Minister (5 October) by arguing against this, claiming that these troops would be needed in France. He also asked Allenby to state his extra troop requirements to advance from the Gaza–Beersheba line (30 miles wide) to the Jaffa–Jerusalem line (50 miles wide), urging him to take no chances in estimating the threat of a German-reinforced threat (although neither Allenby nor Robertson really thought there was much chance of this happening), but urging Maude not to exaggerate his needs in Mesopotamia.\n\nRobertson, worried that he would be overruled as Painlevé was visiting London for talks, without waiting for Allenby's reply, claimed (9 October) that 5 divisions would need to be redeployed from France to reach the Jaffa-Jerusalem line, and that Allenby would face at least 16 Turkish divisions (120,000 men). That same day Allenby's own estimate arrived, claiming that he would need 13 extra divisions (an impossible demand even if Haig's forces went on the defensive) and that he might face 18 Turkish and 2 German divisions. Yet in private letters Allenby and Robertson agreed that sufficient British Empire troops were already in place to take and hold Jerusalem. In the event the Germans sent only 3 battalions to Palestine, and Turkish strength there was only 21,000 (out of 110,000 on all fronts) facing 100,000 British Empire troops. The politicians were particularly irritated that they were being shown clearly exaggerated estimates at a time when the General Staff were demanding renewed effort to \"divert (Germany's) strategic reserve\" to Flanders.\n\nIn his 8 October paper, Haig claimed that since 1 April 1917, 135 of the 147 German divisions on the Western Front had been driven from their positions or withdrawn after suffering losses, several of them two or three times, and argued that the Allies could beat Germany in 1918 even if Russia were to make peace. The War Cabinet was sceptical, and in his reply (9 October) Robertson, although he thought Haig's memo \"splendid\", cautioned that German Army morale still seemed to be holding up well. He wrote to Haig in the same letter that \"the Palestine thing will \"not\" come off\", and having heard from Lord Robert Cecil that Haig was dissatisfied with him, asked him to \"let me do my own job in my own way\" in standing up for proper principles of warfare against Lloyd George. He also commented that (Lloyd George) was \"out for my blood very much these days\" and claimed that \"Milner, Carson, Cecil, Curzon and Balfour, have each in turn expressly spoken to me separately about his intolerable conduct\", that he hoped \"matters would come to a head\" at the next Cabinet as he was \"sick of this d–d life\", that he would \"manage\" Lloyd George, and that Painleve's recent visit to London had been an attempt to \"carry him off his feet\" but that he \"had big feet!\".\n\nRobertson also (9 October) advised against the Prime Minister's recent talk of setting up a Supreme War Council, reminding ministers of the Nivelle fiasco and the sending of heavy guns to Italy only for Cadorna to call off his offensive, and wanted Britain to dominate operations in 1918 by virtue of the strength of her army and her political stability.\n\nThe War Cabinet (11 October 1917) invited Wilson and French to submit formal written advice, a blatant undermining of Robertson's position. Dining with Wilson and French the night before, Lloyd George claimed that Robertson was \"afraid of Haig, & that both of them are pigheaded, stupid & narrow visioned\". Wilson and French urged no major war-winning offensive until 1919. Robertson thought the War Cabinet a \"weak kneed craven hearted Cabinet ... Lloyd George hypnotises them and is allowed to run riot\". Derby had to remind them that Robertson was still their constitutional adviser, and Haig was too busy to come to a planned showdown to which Lloyd George invited him and Robertson. Haig advised Robertson not to resign until his advice had actually been rejected.\n\nAs advised by Wilson and Viscount French, Lloyd George persuaded the War Cabinet and the French to agree to a Supreme War Council. Hankey (20 October) suspected that the plan of an inter-allied staff of generals in Paris would alone be enough to drive Robertson to resignation. Wilson was appointed British Permanent Military Representative after it had been offered to Robertson (which would have meant giving up his CIGS job). Robertson later claimed in his memoirs that he supported the SWC as a political body, but not the military advisers providing separate advice from the national general staffs.\n\nThe argument was overtaken by disaster on the Italian front: the Battle of Caporetto began on 24 October. Robertson later wrote to Edmonds in 1932 that although he had kept the diversion of divisions to Italy to a minimum, some reinforcements had to be sent as the Italians would not have been impressed by claims that they were best helped by renewed British attacks in Flanders.\n\nRobertson went to Italy to supervise deployment of British divisions, meeting Lloyd George, Hankey and Wilson when they arrived for the Rapallo Conference (6–7 November), which formally established the Supreme War Council. Robertson had been told by Hankey that Lloyd George had the War Cabinet's backing, and Lloyd George (Memoirs ii 440-1) later wrote of Robertson's \"general sulkiness\" and \"sullen and unhelpful\" attitude at the conference. He walked out of the meeting, telling Hankey \"I wash my hands of this business\", and contemplated resignation, as he had over the French-Wilson papers.\n\nLloyd George and Robertson had long been briefing the press (mainly the \"Morning Post\" in Robertson's case) against one another. After Lloyd George's Paris speech (12 November), in which he said that \"when he saw the appalling casualty lists\" he \"wish(ed) it had not been necessary to win so many (\"victories\")\", and unlike the Nivelle Affair, Lloyd George's differences with the generals were being aired in public for the first time. The \"Daily News\", \"Star\" and \"Globe\" attacked Lloyd George.\n\nRobertson reported to the War Cabinet (14 November) that Italy's situation was like that of Russia in 1915 and that she might not recover. In his paper \"Future Military Policy\" (19 November), Robertson was impressed by the French Army's recovery under Petain but advised that lack of French reserves might make major French offensives in 1918 unlikely. He rejected a purely defensive posture in the west, as even defending would still result in heavy casualties, but was sceptical of Haig's wish to renew the Ypres Offensive in Spring 1918, and argued that Britain should build up her strength on the Western Front and then decide on the scale of her 1918 offensives. He warned (correctly) that, with Russia dropping out of the war, the Germans would use the opportunity to attack in 1918 before the American Expeditionary Force were present in strength. Lloyd George replied (wrongly) that the Germans would not attack and would fail if they did.\n\nAmid talk of Austen Chamberlain withdrawing support from the government, Robertson briefed the Opposition Leader Asquith. However, Lloyd George survived the Commons debate on Rapallo (19 November) by praising the generals and claiming that the aim of the Supreme War Council was purely to \"coordinate\" policy.\n\nDerby got the Prime Minister to agree that Robertson should accompany Wilson (British Military Representative) to all Supreme War Council meetings and he would make no proposals until Robertson and the War Council had had a chance to vet them. He then reneged on this promise, telling Derby (26 November) that Robertson would have a chance to comment at the meeting itself and that decisions would have to ratified by the War Cabinet after they had been made. Lloyd George restored Wilson's freedom of action by instructing Wilson to send his reports directly to him.\n\nHankey wrote (26 November) that only Britain, the USA and Germany were likely to last until 1919 and that \"on the whole the balance of advantage lies with us, provided we do not exhaust ourselves prematurely\".\n\nBy the time of the initial SWC meeting (Versailles 1 December 1917) Allenby's successes, culminating in the Fall of Jerusalem (9 December 1917), demonstrated the potential of attacks in the Middle East, particularly compared to Haig's apparently unproductive offensive at Ypres, followed by Cambrai in November (initial success followed by retaking of gains). Russia had finally collapsed (Brest Litovsk Armistice 16 December) yet only a handful of American divisions were available so far in the west.\n\nAfter the Fall of Jerusalem Derby threatened to resign if Lloyd George sacked Robertson, but the War Cabinet (11–12 December) minuted its dissatisfaction at the information which he had given them about Palestine. Maurice claimed that intelligence from Syria \"was too stale to be of use\" and Robertson claimed that the speed of Allenby's advance, often with little water, had taken everyone by surprise.\n\nAfter the Fall of Jerusalem, Allenby irritated Robertson by writing that he could conquer the rest of Palestine with his present force of 6–8 divisions, but said he would need 16–18 divisions for a further advance of 250 miles to Aleppo (the Damascus-Beirut Line) to cut Turkish communications to Mesopotamia. In a paper of 26 December, Robertson claimed that the conquest of the remainder of Palestine might mean an extra 57,000 battle casualties and 20,000 sick. Amery (30 December) thought this \"an amazing document even from him\" and that such arguments could have been produced against any major campaign in history. By mid-January Amery and Lloyd George were arranging for the Permanent Military Representatives at Versailles to discuss Palestine (they thought Turkish ration strength was 250,000 \"at most\" whereas the General Staff put it at 425,000, of whom around half were combatants).\n\nRobertson tried to control Lt Gen Sir William Raine Marshall (Maude's replacement as C-in-C Mesopotamia) by handpicking his staff. Smuts was sent to Egypt to confer with Allenby and Marshall and prepare for major efforts in that theatre. Before his departure, alienated by Robertson's cooking of the figures, he urged Robertson's removal. Allenby told Smuts of Robertson's private instructions (sent by hand of Walter Kirke, appointed by Robertson as Smuts' adviser) that there was no merit in any further advance and worked with Smuts to draw up plans for further advances in Palestine.\n\nWilson wanted Robertson reduced \"from the position of a Master to that of a servant\". Robertson thought Wilson's SWC Joint Note 12, which predicted that neither side could win a decisive victory on the Western Front in 1918, and that decisive results could be had against Turkey, \"d-----d rot in general\" and promised Haig he would \"stick to (his) guns and clear out if (he was) overruled\". Joint Note 12 and Note 14 proposing the formation of a General Reserve were discussed at the second full session of the SWC (30 January – 2 February 1918): Robertson opposed attacks on Turkey, (1 Feb) siding openly with Clemenceau against Lloyd George. Although Robertson apologised for doing so, the Prime Minister was angry and told Wilson afterwards that he would have to get rid of Robertson. Robertson's request to be on the Executive Board controlling the planned Allied General Reserve was overruled.\n\nRobertson called the Executive War Board the \"Versailles Soviet\" and claimed to the King's adviser Lord Stamfordham that having \"practically, two CIGSs\" would lead to \"destruction of confidence among the troops\". He also briefed Gwynne against the proposals, writing that \"the little man\" was \"all out for (his) blood\" and \"to see that the fine British Army is not placed at the mercy of irresponsible people – & some of them foreigners at that\".\n\nRobertson was finally forced out in February 1918 over his refusal to agree that the British representative at the Supreme War Council at Versailles should be Deputy CIGS and a member of the Army Council (giving him the right to issue orders to the BEF). He distrusted the dual chain of command set up by the War Cabinet, he wanted civilians to stay out of military decision-making. Lloyd George offered Robertson a choice of remaining as CIGS in London with reduced powers (reporting to the Secretary of State for War rather than directly to the War Cabinet), or else accepting the Versailles job. Robertson's position was that either the CIGS should himself be the Versailles delegate or else the Versailles representative should be clearly subordinate to the CIGS. There was talk of the government falling, and Lloyd George attempted to have Robertson swap jobs with Plumer, then commanding British troops in Italy (Plumer refused).\n\nHaig was summoned to London to be consulted; while driving from Victoria Station to 10 Downing Street \"by a circuitous route\" Derby, who had threatened to resign in protest, told him (9 Feb) Robertson \"had lately become most difficult to deal with and lost his temper quickly\". Haig, whose relations with Robertson had been deteriorating since at least the Boulogne Conference of September 1917, told Robertson (11 Feb) it was his duty to go to Versailles or anywhere else the government wanted, and advised the King to insist on Robertson going to Versailles. Derby (in Beaverbrook's phrase \"left stranded like a whale on a sandbank\") withdrew his resignation, which Lloyd George permitted on condition he did not resign again.\n\nFour days of argument, 11 February 1918 through to 14 February 1918, now ensued between Robertson and the War Cabinet. The King thought it would be \"a national calamity\" if Robertson was removed but when told of this Lloyd George told Stamfordham that \"he did not share the King's extremely favourable opinion\" of Robertson \"who had never fought at the Front, had hardly ever visited the trenches, and who was not known by the rank and file\" and that the government would resign if the King attempted to block Robertson's removal. Curzon and Balfour were sympathetic to Robertson's position that the Versailles delegate must report to the CIGS, but he lost Balfour's sympathy at a Cabinet meeting on 14 February where he made clear his dislike of Wilson. He had told Stamfordham that he would serve at Versailles under Plumer as CIGS, but not under Wilson \"his Junior\".\n\nAs part of Lloyd George's power struggle with Robertson and his press supporters, on 16 February the prominent journalists Gwynne and Repington appeared at Bow Street Magistrates' Court charged with having contravened DORA Regulation 18 by printing articles discussing the conflict between Versailles and the War Office, Lloyd George's plans to concentrate efforts against Turkey, and the failure to keep the Army up to strength. Robertson's wife was in the crowd, as were his colleagues Macdonogh and Maurice. Repington later claimed that Robertson had told him that he could no more afford to be seen with him than either of them \"could afford to be seen walking down Regent Street with a whore\".\n\nAfter a fortnight of argument Robertson's \"resignation\" was announced. Lloyd George, possibly aware that Robertson was dependent on his army pay, suggested he be given command of an Army in France, but Haig said he \"was quite unfitted to command troops\". Robertson wrote notes thanking Maurice, Macdonogh and Whigham, ending \"now get on with the war\". Wilson and Robertson had a very brief handover meeting at the War Office, at which Robertson (by Wilson's account) was \"grumpy and ungracious & said he had nothing to say – and indeed said nothing\". Wilson later recalled (in his last letter as CIGS, to Rawlinson (13 Feb 1922)) that he \"walked out without handing me over anything in particular; there was indeed a box of matches in the top right-hand drawer and some feathers for pipe-cleaning, or the remains of some of the Staff\".\n\nRobertson was appointed General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Eastern Command in February 1918. He would hold this post for four months.\n\nAfter the German \"Michael\" Offensive, the press (8–9 April) blamed Lloyd George for starving the army of men, with the \"Morning Post\" and \"Daily News\" mentioning that it happened just after Robertson's removal while the \"Star\" called for Robertson to be appointed Secretary of State for War. The \"Star\" later blamed the Versailles machinery for forcing a depleted Fifth Army to take over more front, while the \"Globe\" and \"Morning Post\" called for Robertson's restoration as CIGS. Lloyd George was amenable to Haig's suggestion that Robertson be appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, but Robertson wrote to Haig (19 April) \"my job is CIGS or nothing\". Repington in the \"Morning Post\" (20 and 22 April) called this suggestion \"a pretext for getting him out of the way of the imbeciles\" in London and called for Lloyd George's removal as Prime Minister.\n\nOn 29 April Robertson met with his former assistant Maj-Gen Maurice to discuss concerns, which Maurice had heard being discussed at Haig's GHQ on 15 April, that Lloyd George had misled the House of Commons on 9 April about the weakness of the BEF prior to the German \"Michael\" Offensive. From the context (letters from Robertson 29 and 30 April) it is clear that Robertson suggested that he write to Henry Wilson and then, if necessary to the press. Robertson initially suggested he speak to Asquith, Leader of the Opposition, but Maurice did not do so (in John Grigg's view Asquith probably would have advised against going to the press), and Robertson changed his mind later the same day. Maurice composed his letter on 2 May but did not yet send it. Robertson wrote to him on 4 May, writing that not too much credence should be given to imminent predictions of Lloyd George's downfall, that Maurice should take especial care to get his facts exactly right, and adding: \"You are contemplating a great thing – to your undying credit\".\n\nThe Maurice letter, a blatant breach of King's Regulations, appeared in several newspapers on 7 May. Maurice denied that it was a military conspiracy to overthrow a civilian government, and claimed \"it ha(d) been seen by no soldier\" (omitting to mention that Robertson had praised and encouraged him). Lloyd George later claimed in his memoirs that Robertson had been aiming to topple the government and become a military dictator like Hindenburg, claims which were believed by Beaverbrook. However, although journalists like Gwynne and Maxse sometimes dropped such hints, there is no evidence that this was Robertson's intention. Robertson thought Lloyd George would survive the crisis, although he may have hoped to be restored as CIGS.\n\nHankey recorded (8 May) rumours, seemingly being repeated by Lloyd George, that Robertson was plotting with Asquith, Trenchard (recently resigned as Chief of Air Staff), Repington, Gwynne, Maurice and Jellicoe (recently sacked as First Sea Lord), although the rumours also said that Robertson refused to openly associate with the Maurice Letter. Robertson wrote to Lord Milner (Secretary of State for War) denying that he had been involved in such conspiracies. Lloyd George survived the Maurice Debate (9 May).\n\nRobertson was promoted to General Officer Commanding-in-Chief for Home Forces in June 1918. He visited each regional command, and took a special interest in the air defence of London, correctly predicting that the bombing of civilians would play an ever greater role in future wars.\n\nHaig had gradually established a warily respectful relationship with Wilson, with whom he was on first-name terms, which he never had been with Robertson. (A letter to Haig on 16 February 1918, shortly before his resignation, is the only known occasion on which Robertson addressed Haig by his first name.) After the war Haig paid tribute at a dinner to Wilson, but not to Robertson, who was present. Robertson left remarking he would \"never go farting with 'Aig again\".\n\nRobertson became Commander-in-Chief of the British Army of the Rhine in April 1919. It was at a tennis-party at his house in Cologne that the young Captain Montgomery persuaded him to add his name to the list of officers selected for Staff College, which would be his only hope of ever achieving high command. In late June 1919 it briefly appeared that Germany might refuse to sign the Versailles Treaty. Units – consisting largely of young and inexperienced soldiers as war veterans had been given priority for demobilisation – had to be concentrated to advance further into Germany and be prepared for irregular warfare, but the crisis passed.\n\nRobertson was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in the King's Birthday Honours in June 1919. He was not invited to the peace celebration on 19 July 1919. He was thanked by Parliament, granted £10,000 (the same amount as Wilson, Birdwood or Trenchard; the capital was held in trust and only the income made available) and created a Baronet, of Beaconsfield in the County of Buckingham on 29 December 1919.\n\nAfter the War he was also awarded the Belgian War Cross, the Grand Cross of the Serbian Order of the White Eagle (with Swords) and the American Distinguished Service Medal. This was as well as being appointed to the Chinese Order of Chia-Ho (1st Class), being given the Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy, being appointed to the Russian Order of Alexander Nevsky and receiving the Japanese Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun.\n\nTroop reductions meant that the Rhine Command was being downgraded to a lieutenant-general's command, so in July 1919 Churchill offered Robertson the Irish Command, often a last posting for distinguished generals nearing retirement. Although the level of violence in Ireland in 1919 was not yet as high as it would be in 1920–21, there were concerns that Robertson lacked the subtlety for the job. In October the CIGS Henry Wilson warned Churchill that the planned introduction of Irish Home Rule that autumn would lead to unrest, and asked him to consult the Prime Minister, perhaps in the knowledge that Lloyd George disliked Robertson. Lloyd George suggested that Robertson be appointed Commander-in-Chief, India, but this job was already earmarked for Rawlinson. Lloyd George preferred Macready for the Irish job, as he had experience of peacekeeping duties in South Wales and Belfast as well as having served as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London. Churchill again told the Prime Minister in February 1920 that he wanted Robertson, then protested that he had been overruled. He promoted Robertson to field marshal \"as a consolation prize\" on 29 March 1920,\n\nOn returning to the UK Robertson received no official welcome at Victoria Station and later recorded that \"having secured a broken-down taxi I drove to my residence in Eccleston Square; and thereupon joined the long list of unemployed officers on half-pay\".\n\nRobertson was colonel of the 2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys) from 9 March 1916 and colonel of the 3rd/6th Dragoon Guards from 31 December 1925. He became Colonel of the Royal Horse Guards in 1928; this made him Gold Stick and a member of the Royal Household. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in 1931.\n\nOn retirement Robertson's life savings had been a mere £600 (just over £20,000 at 2014 prices). He became chairman of the Brewers' Trustees and a director of British Dyestuffs Corporation as well as President of the British Legion. He became a director of the British Palestine Corporation and of the London General Omnibus Company – forty years later he was still remembered for his efforts on behalf of the men's welfare. Despite having made gifts to members of his family, on his death he left a modest fortune of £49,000 (almost £3,000,000 at 2014 prices).\n\nAlthough not a pacifist, in his later years Robertson often spoke out against the cost – both financial and human – of war. His interests were fishing, shooting and golf. Early in 1933 he told Edmonds that his chief regret was that he had never had a command in the field. He died from a thrombosis on 12 February 1933, aged 73. Mount Robertson in the Canadian Rockies and Sir William Robertson High School in his birth village, Welbourn, were named after him.\n\nHe is buried in Brookwood Cemetery.\n\nRobertson was a man of strong physique and physical presence, admired by the King for his rise from humble origins. He had a prodigious memory and was very quick on the uptake, sometimes interrupting briefings with: \"yes, I have got that, get on to the next point\". However, although he could be amusing company off duty, as he rose the career ladder his brusque manner, possibly adopted to assert his authority, became more marked, even with superiors. \"I've 'eard different\" was a favourite retort to politicians who made military suggestions.\n\nChurchill later wrote that Robertson \"was an outstanding military personality. His vision as a strategist was not profound … he had no ideas of his own, but a sensible judgement negative in bias\" but he also commented that Robertson \"had never himself at any time led even a troop in action, and whose war duties involved him in no more risk than many clerks\". Hankey wrote that \"he knew what he wanted and he nearly always got his own way\".\n\nIn October 1918 Foch told Derby that Robertson was \"a far sounder man than Wilson\" with a greater grasp of strategic detail, but less able to keep the British Cabinet on side. Foch had earlier told Spears \"Robertson builds small, but he builds solid\".\n\nSpears wrote that he was \"an overwhelming personality ... very intolerant of () ignorance ... arrogant, aitchless when excited, and flat-footed (both figuratively and physically) ... an ambulating refrigerator ... when speaking of (any minister) he generally closed the sentence by making the gesture of a governess rapping the knuckles of a child fiddling with things on the table ... a great man, probably the best and finest soldier we produced in the war ... his manners were not good ... for the sake of standing by Haig he probably put aside and overrode many ideas of his own ... (in his loyalty to Haig) he was \"plus royaliste que le roi\"\". His papers were \"a monument of common sense and foresight\". Spears' secretary was the daughter of Maurice, whom he described as \"Man Friday\" to \"this whale of a man, this soldier shipwrecked on the desert island of politics\".\n\nMaurice Hankey recorded that on a prewar committee which he had chaired Robertson, then Director of Military Training, had sat rudely with his back turned to him, until he had flattered him by seeking his advice privately. He wrote that \"Perhaps his greatest quality … was \"character\". His was a dominating personality … (until) he had to give place to a more nimble and versatile mind (i.e. Wilson)\".\n\nLloyd George (Memoirs Vol i. p467) accused Robertson of having \"a profound and disturbing suspicion of all foreigners\", but this is an exaggeration – with Britain and France allies for only the second time in their history, Robertson had played a leading role in instigating the Chantilly Conference at the end of 1915, and extended his hand to reach agreement with Nivelle in March 1917 and Petain in summer 1917.\n\nLloyd George's biographer John Grigg is extremely critical of Robertson's behaviour during the Maurice Affair of May 1918. He comments that both Robertson and Maurice had time on their hands following their recent ousting and that men in such circumstances are apt to persuade themselves that great issues of principle are at stake. \"In a remarkable, if flawed, career this was the ignoblest episode … Robertson's manipulative conduct [in encouraging Maurice to breach King's Regulations and destroy his own career] stands to his eternal discredit\". Grigg believes that Robertson hoped to be reinstated as CIGS. Given Robertson's behaviour, Lloyd George's fears of a military plot to oust him were \"not entirely fanciful\".\n\nRobertson later wrote that \"there was never, so far as I know, any material difference of opinion between (himself and Haig) in regard to the main principles to be observed in order to win the war\".\n\nDavid Woodward argues that, while his partnership with Haig was \"arguably the most important partnership in British military history\", which helped to ensure a massive British commitment to the Western Front, to some extent Robertson would have preferred more cautious attritional attacks rather than Haig's attempts at achieving deeper territorial objectives and possibly even breakthrough. Lloyd George claimed that Robertson was dominated by Haig, his senior in rank and social position; Woodward does not wholly accept this: although he did discourage Haig's promotion to field marshal while the Somme battle was still underway, in general Robertson simply thought it inappropriate to question Haig's plans while they were being carried out.\n\nCassar writes that Robertson was \"blunt, graceless and prone to emotional outbursts when upset\". \"One can only speculate why someone as tough-minded and opinionated as Robertson would habitually defer to Haig. The reason, it would seem, was … because he was convinced that any split between the two would be exploited by the politicians to further their own agendas\".\n\nHaig's diary does record that Robertson was hard to work with as he was not \"a gentleman\", and he wrote to his wife (30 May 1917) that he was \"tactless\" for wanting to come out to France during Messines \"all for his own advertisement\".\n\nRobertson's rival Wilson appears to have held him in similar social disdain. Early in Robertson's tenure as Commandant at Staff College (20 December 1910), he did not speak to Wilson when he visited Staff College with the CIGS Nicholson, causing his predecessor to complain to Nicholson about his \"most rude & unpardonable behaviour\". After Robertson had again not spoken to him at a Staff College point-to-point (25 March 1911), Wilson wrote that he was \"an ill-mannered swine, though I don't think he means to be rude\". Wilson wrote (in 1915) \"He is secretive &, like all underbreds, suspicious; also his manners are somewhat repugnant\" and that he was \"a slippery old boy\" and \"It is d(amnable?) to work with a man who is not a gentleman. The moment the strain comes so does the hairy heel.\"\n\nRobertson's lack of social graces was also remarked on by the staff officer Philip Howell (letter to his wife 10 April 1915) and, in 1933, by General \"Tavish\" Davidson to Spears.\n\nEdmonds later argued in the Official History that Robertson had lost his position because of his bluntness and inability to get on with politicians. Woodward rejects this argument, arguing that although the government's failure to agree on clear war aims, other than defeating Germany, made his job much harder, ministers largely supported Robertson's commitment to the Western Front throughout 1916 and 1917, rather than Lloyd George's many schemes, until the manpower situation meant that a winding-down of that commitment was becoming inevitable (although in fact the war would take a different turn in 1918). Robertson himself noted in 1932 that Lloyd George's object (the \"firework strategy\" as he called it at the time) had been \"to avoid fighting Germans\" and that his survival as CIGS had often depended on Lloyd George's inability to persuade either the French or his ministerial colleagues to adopt his plans rather than Robertson's.\n\nMuch ink has been spilled over Robertson's behaviour over Third Ypres, when he kept from the government both his disagreements with Haig (over the likelihood of territorial gains, Germany's nearness to defeat and the necessity for serious French participation) and, in mid-June, Lt-Col Edward Spears' reports on the extent of the French Mutiny. Terraine, quoting Victor Bonham-Carter, argued that by the second half of 1917 the distrust between Robertson and Lloyd George was such that he felt that, if he did not stand solid with Haig, Lloyd George would lose the war by transferring resources to other fronts. Woodward describes Robertson's behaviour as \"indefensible\".\n\nHankey tried to institute weekly breakfasts between Lloyd George and Robertson, but these had failed as Lloyd George liked to sit talking for a long time after breakfast. Although he cultivated a myth that he never read, Lloyd George was in fact a very early riser, who would have already have completed much of the day's paperwork before breakfast, and therefore preferred to do business at breakfast meetings rather than in the evening. Austen Chamberlain found the practice equally irritating.\n\nLate in 1894, after his return from Chitral, he married Mildred Palin, the daughter of Lt-Gen Charles Thomas Palin of the Indian Army. Her family did not approve of the match, and their first child, a son, died in infancy.\n\nThey then had two daughters and two more sons. His elder surviving son, Brian Hubert (1896–1974), succeeded to the baronetcy, rose to become a general in the British Army and was raised to the peerage as Baron Robertson of Oakridge in 1961. His younger son John (1909–28) predeceased him, a tragedy which clouded his final years.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "733176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=733176", "title": "The Double Life of Veronique", "text": "The Double Life of Veronique\n\nThe Double Life of Veronique (, ) is a 1991 French-Polish-Norwegian drama film directed by Krzysztof Kieślowski and starring Irène Jacob. Written by Kieślowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz, the film explores the themes of identity, love, and human intuition through the characters of Weronika, a Polish choir soprano, and her double, Véronique, a French music teacher. The two women do not know each other, and yet they share a mysterious and emotional bond that transcends language and geography.\n\n\"The Double Life of Veronique\" is notable for Sławomir Idziak's innovative cinematography and Zbigniew Preisner's operatic score. The film was Kieślowski's first to be produced partly outside his native Poland. It won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival for Krzysztof Kieslowski, and the Best Actress Award for Irène Jacob. \"The Double Life of Veronique\" was selected as the Polish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 64th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.\n\nIn Poland in 1968, a little girl is shown the stars in the winter sky by her mother, who identifies the Christmas Eve star. In France, a little girl is shown one of the first leaves of spring by her mother, who points out the fine veins running through.\n\nIn Poland in 1990, a young Polish woman named Weronika (Irène Jacob) is singing at an outdoor concert with her choir when a sudden downpour causes the singers to rush for cover. After Weronika holds the last note alone, she meets her boyfriend, Antek (Jerzy Gudejko), and they go to his apartment to have sex. The next day she asks her father to tell Antek she is leaving to be with her sick aunt in Kraków. She tells him that lately she feels she's not alone in the world.\n\nWeronika travels to Kraków by train looking out at the passing landscape through a small clear rubber ball. At her aunt's house, Weronika talks about her boyfriend, then meets a friend at a concert rehearsal. As the choir rehearses, Weronika, who is watching offstage, accompanies them in her soprano voice. Afterwards, the musical director asks her to audition. Overjoyed, Weronika rushes home with the sheet music. On the way, she passes through Main Market Square, where a protest rally is in progress. One protester runs into her, causing her to drop her music folder. After retrieving the sheet music, Weronika notices a French tourist taking photos of the protestors—a young woman who looks exactly like her. Weronika smiles as she watches her double board the tourist bus that soon pulls away.\n\nAt the audition, Weronika's singing impresses the musical director and conductor, and she is later told that she won the audition. The next day, while on a trolley studying the score, Weronika notices her boyfriend Antek following on his motorbike. When they talk, she apologizes for not returning his calls, and Antek tells her he loves her. Later, while getting dressed for the concert, Weronika presses her face against a window and sees an old woman with shopping bags slowly making her way along the street. That night during the concert, while singing a solo part, Weronika collapses onstage and dies.\n\nIn Paris that day, a young French woman named Véronique (Irène Jacob), after sex with her former boyfriend, is overwhelmed with sadness, as if she were grieving. The next day, at the school where she teaches music, Véronique attends a marionette performance with her class about a ballet dancer who breaks her leg and then turns into a butterfly. She then leads her class in a musical piece by an eighteenth-century composer, Van den Budenmayer—the same piece performed by Weronika when she died. That night while driving home, she sees the puppeteer at a traffic light motioning to her not to light the wrong end of her cigarette. Later she is awakened by a phone call with no one speaking, but in the background she hears a choir singing the music of Van den Budenmayer. The next day, Véronique drives to her father's house where she reveals she is in love with someone she doesn't know, and that recently she felt she was alone—that someone was gone from her life. Back in Paris, she receives a letter containing a shoelace, which she compares to her EKG graph, and a stranger shines light on her using a mirror.\n\nVéronique learns that the puppeteer is a children's book author named Alexandre Fabbri (Philippe Volter), whose marionette story was based on his book \"Libellule & Papillon\". One of his other books is about a shoelace. In the coming days, Véronique reads several of Alexandre's books. When Véronique visits her father, he gives her a package addressed to her containing a cassette tape. When she's alone, she listens to the mysterious recording of a typewriter, footsteps, a door opening, a train station, and a fragment of music by Van den Budenmayer. There are also sounds of a car accident and explosion. The postage stamp on the envelope leads Véronique to a Gare Saint-Lazare train station cafe where she believes the cassette recording was made. There she sees Alexandre sitting by himself, as if waiting for her. He tells her he's been waiting for her for two days, that he's working on a new book, and that this was a kind of experiment to see if she would come to him. Angered at being manipulated, Véronique leaves and takes a taxi to a nearby hotel, After checking in, she sees Alexandre, who apparently ran after the taxi. He asks for her forgiveness, and she brings him up to her room, where they both fall asleep. During the night, he confesses his love for her and they become sexual partners.\n\nThe next morning she tells him, \"All my life I've felt like I was here and somewhere else at the same time.\" While looking at a proof sheet of photos taken on Véronique's recent trip to Poland, Alexandre notices what he thinks is a photo of Véronique, but she assures him it is not her, that she in fact took the photo—of a young Polish woman carrying a music folder. Later at his apartment, Véronique sees Alexandre working on a new marionette with her image. When asked about the purpose of a second identical marionette, Alexandre explains, \"I handle them a lot when I perform. They get damaged easily.\" He shows her how to work the one marionette while the double lies lifeless on the table.\n\nSome time later, Alexandre reads his new book to Véronique about two women, born the same day in different cities, who have a mysterious connection. Later that day, Véronique arrives at her father's house, stops at the front gate, and reaches out and touches an old tree. Her father, who is inside the house, seems to sense this without seeing it.\n\nThe film has a strong fantasy element, though the supernatural aspect of the story is never explained. Like the later \"\", it showcased Preisner's musical score as a major plot element, crediting his work to the fictional Van den Budenmayer. The cinematography is highly stylized, using color and camera filters to create an ethereal atmosphere; the cinematographer, Sławomir Idziak, had previously experimented with these techniques in one episode of \"Dekalog\", and Kieślowski would later use color for a wider range of effects in his \"Three Colors trilogy\". Kieślowski had earlier used the idea of exploring different paths in life for the same person, in his Polish film \"Przypadek\" (\"Blind Chance\"), and the central choice faced by Weronika/Véronique is based on a brief subplot in the ninth episode of \"Dekalog\".\n\nThe film was shot at locations including Clermont-Ferrand, Kraków and Paris.\n\nA Criterion Collection region 1 DVD was released in November 2006 in the United States and Canada, which includes an alternative ending which Kieślowski shot at the request of Harvey Weinstein of Miramax for the American release. Kieślowski added four brief shots to the end of the film showing Véronique's father emerging from the house and Véronique running across the yard to embrace him. The final image of the father and daughter embracing is shot from inside the house through a window.\n\nThe film was scored by Zbigniew Preisner. In the film his music is described as being by Van den Budenmayer, a fictitious eighteenth-century Dutch composer created by Preisner and Kieślowski for attributions in screenplays. Music \"by\" the Dutch composer plays a role in two other Kieślowski films: \"Dekalog\" (1988), and \"Three Colors: Blue\" (1993) in which a theme from his \"musique funebres\" is quoted in the \"Song for the Unification of Europe\". Its E minor soprano solo is prefigured in Weronika's final performance.\n\nThe puppet acts in \"The Double Life of Veronique\" were performed by American puppeteer and sculptor Bruce Schwartz. Unlike most puppeteers who usually hide their hands in gloves or use strings or sticks, Schwartz shows his hands while performing.\n\n\"The Double Life of Veronique\" received mostly positive reviews. In her review in \"Not Coming to a Theater Near You\", Jenny Jediny wrote, \"In many ways, \"The Double Life of Veronique\" is a small miracle of cinema; ... Kieslowski’s strong, if largely post-mortem reputation among the art house audience has elevated a film that makes little to no sense on paper, while its emotional tone strikes a singular—perhaps perfect—key.\"\n\nIn his review in \"The Washington Post\", Hal Hinson called the film \"a mesmerizing poetic work composed in an eerie minor key.\" Noting that the effect on the viewer is subtle but very real, Hinson concluded, \"The film takes us completely into its world, and in doing so, it leaves us with the impression that our own world, once we return to it, is far richer and portentous than we had imagined.\" Hinson was particularly impressed with Jacob's performance:\nIn her review in \"The New York Times\", Caryn James wrote, \"\"Veronique\" is poetic in the truest sense, relying on images that can't be turned into prosaic statements without losing something of their essence. The film suggests mysterious connections of personality and emotion, but it was never meant to yield any neat, summary idea about the two women's lives.\"\n\nIn his review in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert wrote, \"The movie has a hypnotic effect. We are drawn into the character, not kept at arm's length with a plot.\" Ebert singled out Sławomir Idziak's innovative use of color and cinematography:\n\nIn 2009 Ebert added \"The Double Life of Veronique\" to his Great Movies list. Krzysztof Kieślowski's \"Dekalog\" and \"The Three Colors Trilogy\" are also on the list.\n\nIn his review for \"Empire Online\", David Parkinson called it \"a film of great fragility and beauty, with the delicacy of the puppet theatre.\" He thought the film was \"divinely photographed\" by Slawomir Idziak, and praised Irène Jacob's performance as \"simply sublime and thoroughly merited the Best Actress prize at Cannes.\" Parkinson saw the film as \"compelling, challenging and irresistibly beautiful\" and a \"metaphysical masterpiece.\"\n\nFilm critic Marek Haltof sees the film as a political allegory in which Weronika represents Poland and Véronique France, or the West: both are highly cultured, but while Véronique is seemingly free to choose her destiny, Weronika's early death represents the sacrifice of Poland during the Second World War and its subsequent incorporation into the Soviet bloc; Véronique senses this loss without realizing what it is, and that she is incomplete without Weronika.\n\nAt the \"All Movie\" web site, the film received a 4-star rating (out of 5) plus \"High Artistic Quality\" citation. At \"About.com\", which specializes in DVD reviews, the film received 5 stars (out of 5 in their critical review. At \"BBC\", the film received 3 stars (out of 5). Finally, on the aggregate reviewer web site \"Rotten Tomatoes\", the film received an 85% positive rating from critics based on 26 reviews.\n\nThe film was the 50th highest-grossing film of the year with a total of 592,241 admissions in France. In North America the film opened on one screen grossing $8,572 its opening weekend. In total the film grossed $1,999,955 at the North American box office playing at a total of 22 theaters in its widest release which is a respectable result for a foreign art film.\n\nA digitally restored version of the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection. The release includes audio commentary by Annette Insdorf, author of \"Double Lives, Second Chances: The Cinema of Krzysztof Kieślowski\"; three short documentary films by Kieślowski: \"Factory\" (1970), \"Hospital\" (1976), and \"Railway Station\" (1980); \"The Musicians\" (1958), a short film by Kieślowski’s teacher Kazimierz Karabasz; \"Kieślowski’s Dialogue\" (1991), a documentary featuring a candid interview with Kieślowski and rare behind-the-scenes footage from the set of \"The Double Life of Veronique\"; \"1966-1988: Kieślowski, Polish Filmmaker\", a 2005 documentary tracing the filmmaker’s work in Poland, from his days as a student through \"The Double Life of Veronique\"; a 2005 interview with actress Irène Jacob; and new video interviews with cinematographer Slawomir Idziak and composer Zbigniew Preisner. It also includes a booklet featuring essays by Jonathan Romney, Slavoj Zizek, and Peter Cowie, and a selection from \"Kieślowski on Kieślowski\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3030921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3030921", "title": "The Wandering Jew (novel)", "text": "The Wandering Jew (novel)\n\nThe Wandering Jew () is an 1844 novel by the French writer Eugène Sue.\n\nThe story is entitled \"The Wandering Jew\", but the figure of the Wandering Jew himself plays a minimal role. The prologue of the text describes two figures who cry out to each other across the Bering Straits. One is the Wandering Jew, the other his sister, Hérodiade. The Wandering Jew also represents the cholera epidemic— wherever he goes, cholera follows in his wake.\n\nThe Wandering Jew and Hérodiade are condemned to wander the earth until the entire Rennepont family has disappeared from the earth. The connection is that the descendants of the sister are also the descendants of Marius de Rennepont, Huguenots persecuted under Louis XIV by the Jesuits. Sue never explains how a Huguenot family came to be descended from an immortal Jewish woman who never married or had children. The brother and sister are compelled to protect this very family from all harm. After this first introduction, the two appear only very rarely.\n\nThe Rennepont family is unaware that these protective \"éminences grises\" exist, but they benefit from their protection in various ways, be it by being saved from scalping by the Native Americans, or from languishing in prison.\n\nThe Rennepont family lost its position and most of its wealth during the French persecution of the Protestants (after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685). A small fortune was given to a Jewish banker immediately before the Renneponts dispersed all over Europe and Asia, and this fortune has grown into a huge sum, through the miracle of compound interest. In 1682, the Rennepont family members each got a bronze medal telling them to meet back in Paris 150 years later, at which time the fortune will be divided among the surviving members. So much time has passed, however, that almost none of the still-living Renneponts have any idea why they need to come to Paris. They nevertheless set out from India, Siberia, America, France, and elsewhere to make their way to rue Saint-François No. 3 in Paris by 13 February 1832.\n\nThe members of the family are not only dispersed all over the world, but also all over the social ladder, as laborers, factory owners, princes (in India!) and the independently wealthy.\n\nThe Jesuits have heard of this huge fortune and want to get it for themselves. Two Jesuits (Rodin and Père d'Aigrigny) and their many recruited accomplices are in charge of obtaining the money for the Society of Jesus and dispossessing the Rennepont family. Their plan is to have only the unwitting Gabriel, the Jesuit missionary, show up to claim the fortune. Since he is a monk and can have no possessions of his own, the fortune will go to the wily Jesuits. Gabriel's entry into the order is not accidental – it is his pious mother, manipulated by the Jesuits, who persuaded him to become a Jesuit.\n\nThe Jesuits have spies and henchmen all over the world, from the remote Americas to Siberia, and they use them to put obstacles in the paths of the Renneponts as they make their way back to Paris. Moreover, they also spy on each other, demonstrating that they don't even trust each other.\n\nThe principal obstacles are as follows:\nGénéral Simon, father of Rose and Blanche, is a Rennepont, unknown to his daughters. Général Simon has been so long exiled from France and his family that he doesn't even know he has daughters. He thinks he has one son. He does not arrive for the meeting, either, although his situation is less clear than that of the others. \n\nOnly Gabriel shows up to the meeting, but at the last minute Hérodiade makes an appearance. Gabriel recognizes her from when she rescued him in the Americas. Hérodiade goes to a drawer and pulls out a codicil that explains that the parties have three and a half months from 13 February to present themselves. Upon this unexpected turn of events the Père d'Aigrigny is fired, and Rodin replaces him. He decides to take more drastic action by using cholera to annihilate some of the Rennepont family. He maneuvers Rose, Blanche, and Jacques in front of the cholera epidemic and thereby rids himself of them.\n\nWith François Hardy, Rodin shows him how Hardy's best friend had betrayed him. He also arranges for Hardy's mistress to leave for the Americas, and has Hardy's treasured factory burn to the ground (all this on the same day). Hardy takes refuge among the Jesuits, who persuade him to enter their order.\n\nDjalma falls in love with Adrienne, so the Jesuits use his passion to destroy him: they make Djalma think that Adrienne has been unfaithful, and he poisons himself. But he dies slowly and drinks only half the bottle, so there's plenty of time for Adrienne to find out what he's done and poison herself, too. ( c.f. Romeo and Juliet).\n\nOn the day of the second meeting, none of the Renneponts show up (Gabriel having quit the Jesuits), and Rodin alone presents himself. But Samuel, the guardian of the house, has realized the injustices that have taken place. He brings the coffins of all the Renneponts back to show Rodin his wickedness, and he burns the testament that would have given Rodin access to the money.\n\nGabriel and Hardy die as a matter of course, which means that the Wandering Jew and Hérodiade can finally rest in peace. The last pages of the novel recount their final \"death,\" which they joyfully encounter. It is not clear what finally happens to the vast fortune that was never claimed.\n\n\"The Wandering Jew\" was a serially published novel, which attained great popularity in Paris, and beyond. According to historian John McGreevy, the novel was intensely and deliberately \"anti-Catholic.\" Its publication, and that of its predecessor \"The Mysteries of Paris\", greatly increased the circulation of the magazines in which they were published; in addition they are held to have influenced legislation on the Jesuits, and caused a general \"jesuitophobie\". The novel is over 1400 pages long. An opera, \"Le Juif errant\", by Fromental Halévy, was based on elements of the novel.\n\n\n"}

The right-hand head has purple hair and a black beard, with upturned horns, whereas the left-hand head has black hair and a purple beard, with downturned horns. They have slightly different personalities, with the left-hand head seemingly the more rational and sensible of the two, but also slightly grouchier. Speaking in baby-like gibberish except when emphasizing a word, which is usually enough for them to communicate with others, the monster, in typical sketches, would sound out words in front of a brick wall, or do something else which involves cooperation. They are presumably dicephalic parapagus twins, as their mother made an appearance in one sketch when they sounded the word \"mom\"; she has a single head and speaks normally. They share a single pair of arms and legs.\n\nThe creation of this monster was inspired by performers Jerry Nelson and Richard Hunt playing around on the set one day, saying that they were a monster with two heads.

William Beveridge's view was: \"There is no reason why a childless widow should get a pension for life; if she is able to work, she should work. On the other hand, provision much better than at present should be made for those who, because they have the care of children, cannot work for gain or cannot work regularly\".\n\nThe widow had to be receiving Child Benefit for a child who was either hers and her late husband’s, or a child the husband was entitled to Child Benefit for before his death, or a child of hers by an earlier marriage which ended by her being widowed, if she was living with her late husband when he died, or she was expecting a child of her late husband’s (a child conceived by artificial insemination counts if she was living with her husband after that),\n\nOr a person under 19 lives with her who would fit into the previous category, but didn’t get Child Benefit at the time because he or she was abroad when the husband died.\n\nThe amount was £77.45 a week in 2004 if the husband’s contribution record was sufficient. It was possible to get a reduced rate of benefit and an earnings-related component.\n\nThe benefit lasted as long as the children qualified her for it.
