By contrast, if someone dies and a funeral prayer is said on his or her behalf, no other prayer is necessary. \nThe Hadith, or traditions of Muhammad, approve of offering funeral prayers for an absent person. Abu Hurayrah reports: \"The Prophet informed his companions about the death of Negus (Najashi), the king of Abyssinia, the day that he died. And then the Prophet led them to the prayer ground where he lined them up and offered funeral prayer for him with four Takbirs\".\n\nThe time for offering a funeral prayer for an absent person should be within one month after his death. This rule is deduced from the Mursal Hadith stating that Muhammad performed a funeral prayer on the grave of a woman one month after her death, as Sayeed Ibn al-Musayyab reports: \"Saad Bin Ubadh's mother died while the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was absent. When he came to Madinah one month later, he offered the funeral prayer on her grave.\"[Tirmizi]\n\nMuslim scholars have different opinions regarding the funeral prayer on the absentee.\n\nThis is the opinion of a great number of eminent Muslim scholars, including Al Khattaby and Al Rawiyani. Abu Dawud in his Sunan entitled a chapter: “Chapter of performing funeral prayer on a dead Muslim who died in a land of disbelief.”\n\nThis opinion is also the belief of Ibn Taymiyah and his disciple Ibn AlQayyim. The latter said in Zad Al Mi’aad: \"Sheikh Al Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: ‘The right opinion is that the Muslim who died in a land where no funeral prayer was performed on him has the right to have absentee funeral prayer performed on him\". This is similar to what Muhammad did when he heard about the death of Negus of Abyssinia, a Muslim who died in a land of Kufr where there were no Muslims to perform a funeral for him. The absentee prayer fulfills the prayer obligation so that there is no need for other prayers.\n\nThe Shaafa’is and Hanbalis believe that the funeral prayer in absentia should be held for everyone who dies away from his hometown, even if the funeral prayer is offered for him in the place where he dies.\n\nThe second view is that it is prescribed to offer the funeral prayer in absentia if the deceased had benefited the Muslims in some way, such as a scholar, a mujahid or a rich man from whose wealth the people benefited, and so on.\n\nThe third view is that it is prescribed to offer the funeral prayer in absentia so long as the funeral prayer has not been offered for the deceased in the place where he died. If the funeral prayer has been offered for him, then it is not prescribed to offer the funeral prayer for him in absentia.\n\nAl-Khurshi (Maaliki) said (2/142): The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered the funeral prayer for the Negus (in absentia) is one of the things that applied only to him.\n\nSomething similar was stated in Badaa’i al-Sanaa’i by al-Kasaani (Hanafi) (1/312).\n\nAl-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (5/211): \"Our view is that it is permissible to offer the funeral prayer for one died away from his home town, but Abu Haneefah disallowed it. Our evidence is the hadeeth about the Negus, which is saheeh and has no faults, and they do not have any valid answer to that.\"\n\nAl-Shaafa’i imposed a valid restriction on offering the funeral prayer in absentia, which is that the one who offers the funeral prayer for the deceased should be one of those who would have offered the prayer for him the day he died.\n\n\n"}

The vessel and her six-man crew had been fishing the North Atlantic Ocean out of Gloucester, Massachusetts. Her last reported position was northeast of Sable Island on October 28, 1991. The story of \"Andrea Gail\" and her crew was the basis of the 1997 book \"The Perfect Storm\" by Sebastian Junger, and a 2000 film adaptation of the same name.\n\n\"Andrea Gail\" was a commercial fishing vessel constructed in Panama City, Florida in 1978, and owned by Robert Brown. Her home port was Marblehead, Massachusetts. She also sailed from Gloucester, Massachusetts, where she would offload her catch and reload food and stores for her next run.\n\n\"Andrea Gail\" began her final voyage departing from Gloucester Harbor, Massachusetts, on September 20, 1991, bound for the Grand Banks of Newfoundland off the coast of eastern Canada. After poor fishing, Captain Frank W. \"Billy\" Tyne Jr. headed east to the Flemish Cap where he believed they would have better luck. Despite weather reports warning of dangerous conditions, Tyne set course for home on October 26–27. The ship's ice machine was malfunctioning and would not have been able to maintain the catch for much longer.\n\nThe last reported transmission from \"Andrea Gail\" was at about 6:00 p.m. on October 28, 1991. Captain Tyne radioed Linda Greenlaw, Captain of the \"Hannah Boden\", owned by the same company, and gave his coordinates as , or about east of Sable Island. He also gave a weather report indicating seas and wind gusts up to 80 knots (). Tyne's final recorded words were \"She's comin' on, boys, and she's comin' on strong.\" Junger reported that the storm created waves in excess of in height, but ocean buoy monitors recorded a peak wave height of , and so waves of were deemed \"unlikely\" by \"Science Daily\". However, data from a series of weather buoys in the general vicinity of the vessel's last known location recorded peak wave action exceeding in height from October 28 through 30, 1991.\n\nOn October 30, 1991, the vessel was reported overdue. An extensive air and land search was launched by the 106th Rescue Wing from the New York Air National Guard, United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard forces. The search would eventually cover over .\n\nOn November 6, 1991, \"Andrea Gail's\" emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) was discovered washed up on the shore of Sable Island in Nova Scotia. The EPIRB was designed to automatically send out a distress signal upon contact with sea water, but the Canadian Coast Guard personnel who found the beacon \"did not conclusively verify whether the control switch was in the on or off position\". Authorities called off the search for the missing vessel on November 9, 1991, due to the low probability of crew survival.\n\nFuel drums, a fuel tank, the EPIRB, an empty life raft, and some other flotsam were the only wreckage ever found. The ship was presumed lost at sea somewhere along the continental shelf near Sable Island.\n\nAll six of the crew were lost at sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He entered the novitiate for a brief period under a different religious name though ill health forced him to leave but did not hinder him from still training and living alongside the Passionists. He re-entered the order after his ordination and went on to hold several positions of leadership within his own order; he was even likened to Saint Paul of the Cross while Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius X held him in high esteem.\n\nHis beatification was celebrated on 16 October 1988 in Saint Peter's Square and his liturgical feast is affixed to the date of his death as is the custom.\n\nCesare Silvestrelli was born on 7 November 1831 in Rome as the third of seven children to the nobles Gian Tommaso Silvestrelli (d. 1853) and Teresa Gozzani (d. 1846) and were residents of the Piazza della Minerva since their residence was at no. 38; he was baptized just hours after his birth in the names Cesare Pietro at Santa Maria sopra Minerva. His brother was Luigi (d. 20 September 1867). His father's funeral saw the attendance of 120 Franciscans and 40 Capuchins as well as 40 Dominicans.\n\nHe did his initial education first at the Jesuit-run Roman College (1840–47) and thereafter continued his studies at an institute at the Caravita Oratorio in addition to a series of private schools. He was attracted to the Passionist charism and entered their order on 21 February 1854 (at Santi Giovanni e Paolo) before being admitted into their novitiate at their San Giuseppe convent in Monte Argentario on 25 March 1854. He received the religious habit and was given the name \"Luigi del Sacro Cuore di Maria\" on 7 April 1854. But he was forced to leave the novitiate on 3 May due to ill health though continued living with the Passionists in another house in the same town while he did theological studies. He did those studies under Father Pacifico di San Giuseppe and from 31 June to 24 August 1855 lived at Santi Giovanni e Paolo.\n\nSilvestrelli received his ordination to the priesthood on 22 December 1855 (as a diocesan priest rather than one in the religious life) from Bishop Giuseppe-Maria Molajoni. He then decided to re-enter the order and so sent another application before being accepted. On 1 April 1856 he entered the novitiate once again though this time at Morrovalle where he re-assumed the habit and the new religious name \"Bernardo Maria di Gesù\". It was here that he was the classmate of fellow novice Saint Francesco Possenti. He made his final profession on 28 April 1857. Thereafter he pursued studies for preaching and once that was finished he was assigned first as the director of students at Morrovalle (1860-1864) and then as the Master of Novices at the Passionist convent of Scala Santa (adjacent to the Basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome) from January 1865 until 1869.\n\nHis brother Luigi died on September 20, 1867 and he was present at his brother's bedside as he died; he attended the funeral on 23 September at Santa Maria sopra Minerva. He was then appointed as the rector of the Scala Santa convent and held that position from 27 May 1869 until 1875 after being confirmed on 14 April 1872. It was here that - on 19 September 1870 - Pope Pius IX visited the steps from which the convent assumed its name. The pope was making his last visit to the sacred sites of Rome before the dissolution of the Papal States. Silvestrilli supported the Pope through holding onto his arm as both men climbed the steps weeping together.\n\nOn 7 June 1875 he was elected as the first Provincial Consulter of the Roman province (he moved to Vetralla around this stage for a brief period) and he later became the Vice-Provincial Superior in July 1876. In the General Chapter on 4 May 1878 he was elected as the Superior General of the order. and his first term ran until 1884. In this position he worked hard to reconcile rival factions in the order and also founded new houses abroad (more so in Latin America as well as advancing the Bulgarian mission) and reformed the regulations of the order; he was firm in the conviction that a return to the original spirit and the Rule of the founder could be the singular formula for reviving the spirit of the charism. In 1887 he accepted a request from Cardinal Francis Patrick Moran to send Passionists to Australia in 1887.\n\nHe was re-elected as Superior General in 1884 and resigned from the position on 2 January 1889 after making his decision in 1888. In 1893 a vision of his former classmate Possenti convinced him to attend the General Chapter and he was then once more elected as the Superior General (on 3 May) which was a post to which he was re-elected again in 1899 (in the first vote) and on 8 May 1905 (in the first vote). He attended a retreat at Monte Argentario in August 1890 and dwelt in the smallest cell while spending long periods of time before the Eucharist in adoration. He established an international house of studies for Passionist students at Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Rome and visited all the Passionist provinces in the world including a visit to the United States of America in 1896. It was around this stage that he developed arthrosis of the spine that made leg and neck movement difficult for him. He resigned again on 7 July 1907 (for the final time) which Pope Pius X accepted but the pope named him as an \"Onorario Generale\" for life due to his great service while in office and also as a sign of the pope's esteem. He was often praised as a second Saint Paul of the Cross and even Pope Leo XIII and Pius X regarded him high enough to offer him the cardinalate several times despite his humble refusals.\n\nOn 16 June 1911 he retired to the Passionist convent in Moricone and died there on 9 December 1911 after he fell backwards down a set of stairs as he was ascending. His remains were later exhumed and moved to the Moricone convent on 17 April 1931.\n\nThe beatification process opened under Pope Pius XII on 13 February 1942 and he became titled as a Servant of God while the confirmation of his model Christian life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope Paul VI to name him as Venerable on 18 October 1973. Pope John Paul II later beatified Silvestrelli on 16 October 1998 in Saint Peter's Square.\n\nThe current postulator for the cause is the Passionist priest Giovanni Zubiani.\n\n"}

Most famous in silent films and early talkies, she is best known in her performances in \"The Docks of New York\" and \"The Barker\", the latter earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nCompson was the daughter of Virgil K. Compson and Mary Elizabeth Rauscher, born on March 19, 1897, in Beaver, Utah, a mining camp. At various times, her father was a mining engineer, a gold prospector, and a grocery store proprietor. Her mother was a maid in homes and in a hotel. Compson attended public schools in Utah and graduated from Salt Lake High School.\n\nHer father died when she was young and she had to obtain employment as a violinist when 16 years old at a theater in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nPlaying in vaudeville sketches with touring circuits, Compson got noticed by Hollywood producers. While touring, she was discovered by comedic producer Al Christie and signed a contract with him. Her first silent film, \"Wanted, a Leading Lady\", was in November 1915.\n\nShe made 25 films in 1916 alone, although all of them were shorts for Christie with the exception of one feature \"Almost a Widow\". She continued this pace of making numerous short films well into the middle of 1918 when after a long apprenticeship with Christie she started making features exclusively. Compson's star began to rise with the release of the 1919 feature \"The Miracle Man\" (1919) for \"George Loane Tucker.\" Paramount signed Compson to a five-year contract with help of director Tucker.\n\nHer popularity allowed her to establish her own production company that providing her creative control over screenplays and financing. Her first movie as producer was \"Prisoners of Love\" (1921). She played the role of \"Blanche Davis\", a girl born to wealth and cursed by her inheritance of physical beauty. Compson selected Art Rosson to direct the feature. The story was chosen from a work by actress and writer Catherine Henry. After completing \"The Woman With Four Faces\" (1923), Paramount refused to offer her a raise (her salary was $2,500 a week) and she refused to sign without one. Instead, she signed with a motion picture company in London, England. There she starred in a series of four films directed by Graham Cutts, a well-known English filmmaker. The first of these was a movie version of an English play called \"Woman to Woman\" (1923), the screenplay for which was co-written by Cutts and Alfred Hitchcock. Part of The White Shadow (in which played a dual role), another Cutts/Hitchcock collaboration has been found and preserved from a collection in New Zealand.\n\n\"Woman to Woman\" was released in the United States and proved to be popular enough for Jesse Lasky to offer top dollar to return to Paramount. Back in Hollywood, she starred in \"The Enemy Sex\", directed by James Cruze. The two were married on October 25, 1925; they divorced in 1929. Her contract with Paramount was not renewed in 1925 and she decided to freelance, working with lower budget studios such as Columbia Pictures in \"The Belle of Broadway\" (1926) and Chadwick in \"The Ladybird\" (1926). During this time, she was suggested as a replacement for difficult Greta Garbo in the MGM feature \"Flesh and the Devil\" opposite John Gilbert. She was eventually able to work for the studio with former \"The Miracle Man\" co-star Lon Chaney in \"The Big City\"\n\nIn 1928, she appeared in a First National Pictures part-talkie, \"The Barker\". Her performance as manipulative carnival girl Carrie garnered her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, although she lost to Mary Pickford in \"Coquette\". In \"Court-Martial\", a 1928 silent film that apparently has not survived, she became the first actress to portray Old West outlaw Belle Starr on film. In the same year, she appeared in the highly acclaimed Josef von Sternberg film \"The Docks of New York\" in a sympathetic portrayal of a suicidal prostitute rescued by stoker George Bancroft. These films caused Compson's popularity to re-emerge and she became one of the busiest actresses in the new talking cinema. In fact, Chaney offered her the female lead in his first talkie \"The Unholy Three\", but she was too busy and instead suggested friend Lila Lee. Unlike a number of other female stars of silent film, it was felt that her voice recorded exceptionally well. Although she was not a singer, she appeared in a number of early musicals, in which her singing voice was dubbed.\n\nNow divorced from Cruze, Compson's career continued to flourish, starring in nine films in 1930 alone. However, her last hit proved to be in \"The Spoilers\", alongside Gary Cooper. She was unable to score a success and was only able to secure roles in \"poverty row\" studios.\n\nOne major film in which she did not appear was \"Gone With the Wind\"; although she shot a Technicolor screen test for the role of Belle Watling, she was not cast in the role. In 1941, Compson appeared in a small role in an Alfred Hitchcock film \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\". Most of her later films were low-budget, even exploitation, efforts. Compson's last film was \"Here Comes Trouble\" (1948).\n\nDuring the filming of \"Ladies Must Live\", Compson began a relationship with married director George Loane Tucker. However, he was dying and as a favor to her, negotiated a contract with Paramount for her.\n\nIn 1924, Compson married film director James Cruze, who directed her in films such as \"The Enemy Sex\" and \"The Great Gabbo\". They divorced in 1930. The reason for the divorce was that Cruze had an addiction to alcohol and work, which put a strain on their marriage and his health. Soon after their divorce, Cruze filed for bankruptcy, and Compson was forced to sell her possessions to pay past years' income taxes.\n\nCompson later married and divorced agent-producer Irving Weinberg and Silvius Jack Gall, who died in 1962. All unions were childless.\n\nAfter retiring from the screen in 1948, she began a cosmetic line and helped her husband run a business called \"Ashtrays Unlimited\".\n\nCompson died April 18, 1974, of a heart attack, at her home in Glendale, California, aged 77. She was interred in San Fernando Mission Cemetery in San Fernando, California. She left no surviving relatives.\n\nFor her contributions to the motion picture industry, Compson has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1751 Vine Street.\n\nFor main film selections \"see Betty Compson filmography\"\n\n\n\n"}

In each, the body of a murdered woman was placed in a trunk.\n\nThe murders led to Brighton being dubbed \"The Queen of Slaughtering Places\" (a play on \"The Queen of Watering Places\")\n\nThe first murder came to light on 17 June 1934, when an unclaimed plywood trunk was noticed by William Joseph Vinnicombe at the left luggage office of Brighton railway station as he investigated a smell. He alerted the police and Chief Inspector Ronald Donaldson opened the trunk to find the dismembered torso of a woman. When other stations were alerted a suitcase at King's Cross railway station was found to contain the legs. The head and arms were never found. The press named the victim 'The Girl with the Pretty Feet' or simply 'Pretty Feet' because the corpse had 'Dancer's Feet', thought beautiful.\n\nThe post-mortem by Sir Bernard Spilsbury revealed that the woman was about 25 and five months pregnant. Neither the victim nor the murderer was ever identified.\n\nChief Inspector Donaldson suspected a local abortionist named Massiah based on what was known about him and on Spilsbury's notes:Internal examination of the torso had not revealed the cause of death; the legs and feet found at King's Cross belonged to the torso; the victim had been well nourished; she had been not younger than twenty-one and not older than twenty-eight, had stood about five feet two inches, and had weighed roughly eight and a half stones; she was five months pregnant at the time of death.\n\nDonaldson asked officers to watch Massiah covertly. One, drafted from Hove, confronted Massiah, expecting him to come quietly. Instead the doctor wrote a list of names and \"...it seemed to the policeman that the sun had gone in: all of a sudden the consulting room was a place of sombre shadows...\".\n\nThe policeman did not tell Donaldson, who heard only when he was warned by a senior officer to back off. Massiah moved to London where a woman died while he was performing an abortion, yet he evaded prosecution. He remained on the General Medical Register and was removed only after he failed to re-register in 1952, following his retirement to Port of Spain, Trinidad. Spilsbury, always on the lookout for evidence of illegal abortions, described no evidence of interference with the pregnancy, and noted that the dismemberment showed no particular anatomical skill \n\nAlthough the first murder was almost certainly unrelated to the second, it did lead to discovery of the second trunk murder.\n\nThe victim was Violette Kaye (née Watts, also known as Saunders), aged 42. She had been a dancer and prostitute in London, where she had met Toni Mancini, aged 26 who had a criminal record including theft and loitering but who also worked as a waiter and bouncer. He was also known as Cecil Lois England (his real name), Jack Notyre, Tony English and Hyman Gold. They moved to Brighton together in September 1933 and lived at various addresses.\n\nKaye and Mancini’s relationship was tempestuous. One argument occurred on 10 May 1934 at the Skylark café on the seafront, where Mancini worked, when an obviously drunk Kaye accused him of being familiar with a teenage waitress called Elizabeth Attrell. Kaye was never seen again and the following day Mancini told friends she had gone to Paris, and gave some of her clothes and belongings to Attrell. Her sister-in-law also received a telegram which read \"Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. --Vi\"; it was later established that this had been sent from Brighton that morning, by which time Kaye was already dead.\n\nMancini then took new lodgings in 52 Kemp Street, close to the station, and transported a trunk to his new flat by handcart. He put the trunk, with Kaye's non-dismembered body inside it, at the foot of his bed, covered it with a cloth and used it as a coffee table – in spite of the smell and leaking fluids, of which visitors complained.\n\nKaye’s absence had been noted by police and Mancini was questioned. Apparently panicked, he went on the run. During investigation related to the unsolved trunk murder, police searched premises close to the station and stumbled upon Kaye’s remains in Mancini’s lodgings. Mancini was arrested in South East London. The post mortem was also carried out by Sir Bernard Spilsbury.\n\nMancini's trial opened in December 1934 in Lewes Assizes and lasted five days. The prosecution was led by J C Cassells and on his team was Quintin Hogg (later Lord Hailsham). Norman Birkett was defence counsel.\n\nThe prosecution focused on Kaye’s death by a blow to the head. A graphologist confirmed the handwriting on the form for the telegram sent to Kaye’s sister matched that on menus Mancini had written at the Skylark café. One witness, Doris Saville, said Mancini had asked her to provide a false alibi. Other witnesses, friends of Mancini, claimed he boasted in the days after the murder of giving his \"missus\" the biggest hiding of her life.\n\nBirkett’s defence focused on Kaye’s work as a prostitute and her character. Mancini claimed he had discovered Kaye’s body at the flat in Park Crescent, Brighton. Thinking the police would not believe his story because he had a criminal record he kept the matter a secret and put her body in a trunk. Birkett speculated she could have been murdered by a client or fallen down steps into the flat.\n\nThe quality and nature of the forensic evidence was also drawn into doubt by the defence who queried the amount of morphine in Kaye’s blood and proved that items of clothing stained with blood had been purchased after Kaye’s death. The testimony of Sir Bernard Spilsbury, whose stellar career as principal Home Office pathologist was already in decline, was effectively demolished by the brilliant cross-examination and closing speech of Norman Birkett. A number of witnesses also confirmed that Mancini and Kaye had seemed a contented couple.\n\nAfter two and a quarter hours the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.\n\nIn 1976, just before his death, Mancini confessed to a \"News of the World\" journalist. He explained that during a blazing row with Kaye she had attacked him with the hammer he had used to break coal for their fire. He had wrested the hammer from her, but when she had demanded it back, he had thrown it at her, hitting her on the left temple. A prosecution of Mancini for perjury was considered but rejected due to lack of corroboration.\n\nThe case was dramatised in a 1951 episode of Orson Welles' radio drama \"The Black Museum\" titled \"The Hammerhead\" (with the story being changed to reveal the victim's sister as the killer).\n\nThe press attention to the 1934 trunk murders revived interest in a previous Brighton trunk murder. In the 19th century, John Holloway murdered his wife Celia Holloway, a painter on the Chain Pier, then transported her body in a trunk on a wheelbarrow to Lover’s Walk in Preston Park, Brighton, and buried the remains. Holloway was arrested, tried in Lewes and hanged at Horsham gaol on 16 December 1831.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "411174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411174", "title": "Brine shrimp", "text": "Brine shrimp\n\nArtemia is a genus of aquatic crustaceans also known as brine shrimp. \"Artemia\", the only genus in the family Artemiidae, has changed little externally since the Triassic period. The first historical record of the existence of \"Artemia\" dates back to the first half of the 10th century AD from Urmia Lake, Iran, with an example called by an Iranian geographer an \"aquatic dog\", although the first unambiguous record is the report and drawings made by Schlösser in 1757 of animals from Lymington, England. \"Artemia\" populations are found worldwide in inland saltwater lakes, but not in oceans. \"Artemia\" are able to avoid cohabiting with most types of predators, such as fish, by their ability to live in waters of very high salinity (up to 25%).\n\nThe ability of the \"Artemia\" to produce dormant eggs, known as cysts, has led to extensive use of \"Artemia\" in aquaculture. The cysts may be stored for long periods and hatched on demand to provide a convenient form of live feed for larval fish and crustaceans. Nauplii of the brine shrimp \"Artemia\" constitute the most widely used food item, and over 2000 tonnes of dry \"Artemia\" cysts are marketed worldwide annually. In addition, the resilience of \"Artemia\" makes them ideal animals for running biological toxicity assays and it has become a model organism used to test the toxicity of chemicals. Breeds of \"Artemia\" are sold as novelty gifts under the marketing name \"Sea-Monkeys\" or \"Aqua Dragons\".\n\nThe brine shrimp \"Artemia\" comprises a group of seven to nine species very likely to have diverged from an ancestral form living in the Mediterranean area about .\n\nThe Laboratory of Aquaculture & Artemia Reference Center (ARC) at Ghent University possesses the largest known \"Artemia\" cyst collection, a cyst bank containing over 1,700 \"Artemia\" population samples collected from different locations around the world.\n\n\"Artemia\" is a typical primitive arthropod with a segmented body to which is attached broad leaf-like appendages. The body usually consists of 19 segments, the first 11 of which have pairs of appendages, the next two which are often fused together carry the reproductive organs, and the last segments lead to the tail. The total length is usually about for the adult male and for the female, but the width of both sexes, including the legs, is about .\n\nThe body of \"Artemia\" is divided into head, thorax, and abdomen. The entire body is covered with a thin, flexible exoskeleton of chitin to which muscles are attached internally and shed periodically. In female \"Artemia\" a moult precedes every ovulation.\n\nFor brine shrimp, many functions, including swimming, digestion and reproduction are not controlled through the brain; instead, local nervous system ganglia may control some regulation or synchronisation of these functions. Autotomy, the voluntary shedding or dropping of parts of the body for defence, is also controlled locally along the nervous system. \"Artemia\" have two types of eyes. They have two widely separated compound eyes mounted on flexible stalks. These compound eyes are the main optical sense organ in adult brine shrimps. The median eye, or the naupliar eye, is situated anteriorly in the centre of the head and is the only functional optical sense organ in the nauplii, which is functional until the adult stage.\n\nBrine shrimp can tolerate any levels of salinity from 25‰ to 250‰ (25–250 g/L), with an optimal range of 60‰–100‰, and occupy the ecological niche that can protect them from predators. Physiologically, optimal levels of salinity are about 30–35‰, but due to predators at these salt levels, brine shrimp seldom occur in natural habitats at salinities of less than 60–80‰. Locomotion is achieved by the rhythmic beating of the appendages acting in pairs. Respiration occurs on the surface of the legs through fibrous, feather-like plates (lamellar epipodites)\n\nMales differ from females by having the second antennae markedly enlarged, and modified into clasping organs used in mating.\nAdult female brine shrimp ovulate approximately every 140 hours. In favourable conditions, the female brine shrimp can produce eggs that almost immediately hatch. While in extreme conditions, such as low oxygen level or salinity above 150‰, female brine shrimp produce eggs with a chorion coating which has a brown colour. These eggs, also known as cysts, are metabolically inactive and can remain in total stasis for two years while in dry oxygen-free conditions, even at temperatures below freezing. This characteristic is called cryptobiosis, meaning \"hidden life\". While in cryptobiosis, brine shrimp eggs can survive temperatures of liquid air () and a small percentage can survive above boiling temperature () for up to two hours.\nOnce placed in briny (salt) water, the eggs hatch within a few hours. The nauplius larvae are less than 0.4 mm in length when they first hatch. \n\nParthenogenesis is a natural form of reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilisation. Thelytoky is a particular form of parthenogenesis in which the development of a female individual occurs from an unfertilised egg. Automixis is a form of thelytoky, but there are different kinds of automixis. The kind of automixis relevant here is one in which two haploid products from the same meiosis combine to form a diploid zygote.\n\nDiploid \"Artemia parthenogenetica\" reproduce by automictic parthenogenesis with central fusion (see diagram) and low but nonzero recombination. Central fusion of two of the haploid products of meiosis (see diagram) tends to maintain heterozygosity in transmission of the genome from mother to offspring, and to minimise inbreeding depression. Low crossover recombination during meiosis likely restrains the transition from heterozygosity to homozygosity over successive generations.\n\nIn their first stage of development, \"Artemia\" do not feed but consume their own energy reserves stored in the cyst. Wild brine shrimp eat microscopic planktonic algae. Cultured brine shrimp can also be fed particulate foods including yeast, wheat flour, soybean powder or egg yolk.\n\n\"Artemia\" comprises sexually reproducing, diploid species and several obligate parthenogenetic \"Artemia\" populations consisting of different clones and ploidies (2n->5n).\n\nFish farm owners search for a cost-effective, easy to use, and available food that is preferred by the fish. From cysts, brine shrimp nauplii can readily be used to feed fish and crustacean larvae just after one-day incubation. Instar I (the nauplii that just hatched and with large yolk reserves in their body) and instar II nauplii (the nauplii after first moult and with functional digestive tracts) are more widely used in aquaculture, because they are easy for operation, rich in nutrients, and small, which makes them suitable for feeding fish and crustacean larvae live or after drying.\n\n\"Artemia\" found favor as a model organism for use in toxicological assays, despite the recognition that it is too robust an organism to be a sensitive indicator species.\n\nIn pollution research \"Artemia\", the brine shrimp, has had extensive use as a test organism and in some circumstances is an acceptable alternative to the toxicity testing of mammals in the laboratory. The fact that millions of brine shrimp are so easily reared has been an important help in assessing the effects of a large number of environmental pollutants on the shrimps under well controlled experimental conditions.\n\nOverall brine shrimp are abundant, but some populations and localized species do face threats, especially from habitat loss to introduced species. For example, \"A. franciscana\" of the Americas has been widely introduced to places outside its native range and is often able to outcompete local species, such as \"A. salina\" in the Mediterranean region.\n\nAmong the highly localized species are \"A. urmiana\" from Lake Urmia in Iran. Once abundant, the species has drastically declined due to drought, leading to fears that it was almost extinct. However, a second population of this species has recently been discovered in the Koyashskoye Salt Lake at the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n\"A. monica\", the species commonly known as Mono Lake brine shrimp, can be found in Mono Lake, Mono County, California. In 1987, Dennis D. Murphy from Stanford University petitioned the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to add \"A. monica\" to the endangered species list under the Endangered Species Act (1973). The diversion of water by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power resulted in rising salinity and concentration of sodium hydroxide in Mono Lake. Despite the presence of trillions of brine shrimp in the lake, the petition contended that the increase in pH would endanger them. The threat to the lake's water levels was addressed by a revision to California State Water Resources Control Board's policy, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service found on 7 September 1995 that the Mono Lake brine shrimp did not warrant listing.\nScientists have taken the eggs of brine shrimp to outer space to test the impact of radiation on life. Brine shrimp cysts were flown on the U.S. Biosatellite II, Apollo 16, and Apollo 17 missions, and on the Russian Bion-3 (Cosmos 782), Bion-5 (Cosmos 1129), Foton 10, and Foton 11 flights. Some of the Russian flights carried European Space Agency experiments.\n\nOn \"Apollo 16\" and \"Apollo 17\", the cysts traveled to the Moon and back. The cosmic ray passed through an egg would be detected on the photographic film in their container. Some eggs were kept on Earth as experimental controls to ensure a fair test. Also, as the take-off in a spacecraft involves a lot of shaking and acceleration, one control group of egg cysts was accelerated to seven times the force of gravity and vibrated mechanically from side to side for several minutes so that they could experience the same violence of a rocket take-off. There were 400 eggs in each experimental group. All the egg cysts from the experiment were then placed in salt water to hatch under optimum conditions. As a result, a high sensitivity to cosmic radiation was observed on \"Artemia salina\" eggs; 90% of the embryos, which were induced to develop from hit eggs, died at different developmental stages.\n\n"}

Scarpa portrayed a Native American wrestler, who wore a war bonnet to the ring and would \"go on the warpath\" when the fans started cheering him against an opponent. It has been acknowledged that he was in fact an Italian-American.\n\nScarpa's wrestling career began in 1947, under his real name. He was a standout in the Georgia and Florida territories of the National Wrestling Alliance throughout the 1950s and 1960s, winning several championships and becoming a fan favorite.\n\nIn 1970, Scarpa began working for Vincent J. McMahon's World Wide Wrestling Federation as Chief Jay Strongbow, a Native American gimmick complete with a traditional headdress and Native themed wrestling moves. He feuded with the likes of \"The Golden Greek\" Spiros Arion, \"Handsome Jimmy\" Valiant, and Superstar Billy Graham, nearly winning the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship. A memorable match against \"Iron Mike\" McCord featured Strongbow applying his sleeper hold. But Lou Albano, McCord's manager, interfered by smashing a cast on the Chief's forehead. It was alleged that Strongbow had previously jumped Albano in the locker room, breaking his arm. McCord was disqualified, but Strongbow was cut wide open by Albano's blows. Strongbow settled the score in front of a sold out crowd at Madison Square Garden, beating Captain Lou Albano convincingly.\n\nStrongbow picked up a win at Madison Square Garden in the summer of 1970, shortly after he entered the WWWF, pinning top contender Crusher Verdue, who was managed by Lou Albano.\n\nIn 1975, he began feuding with Spiros Arion. Arion, a popular and seemingly unbeatable babyface, returned to the WWWF after an absence and teamed with Strongbow. Arion turned on Strongbow, destroying his headdress on Philadelphia television after he had tied Strongbow in the ropes, and rubbed the feathers in his face. Arion was now a heel, and pinned Strongbow in eastern arenas as he went on to challenge champion Bruno Sammartino.\n\nStrongbow won his first WWWF World Tag Team Championship on May 22, 1972 with partner Sonny King. They defeated the team of Baron Mikel Scicluna and King Curtis Iaukea. Strongbow and King held the title for a month before losing it to the team of Mr. Fuji and Professor Toru Tanaka on June 27.\n\nFour and a half years later, on December 7, 1976, Strongbow won his second WWWF World Tag Team Championship, this time with partner Billy White Wolf. The team won the title in a three-team tournament, defeating The Executioners and Nikolai Volkoff and Tor Kamata. Their reign was cut short in August 1977 when the belts were vacated due to White Wolf suffering a neck injury at the hands of Ken Patera's Swinging Full Nelson.\n\nStrongbow also competed for The Sheik's Big Time Wrestling promotion in Detroit. He had a memorable feud with \"Bulldog\" Don Kent, which culminated in a \"shark cage match\" in 1977. Strongbow and Kent fought inside of a small shark cage, with the first man to escape being declared the winner. With an assist from fellow fan favorite Mark Lewin, Strongbow was able to escape the shark cage victorious.\n\nIn 1979, he feuded with Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine, who broke Strongbow's leg. The two wrestled all over the WWF circuit, including an \"Indian Strap match\" at Madison Square Garden on July 30, 1979.\n\nIn 1982, Strongbow formed a tag team with his on-screen brother, Jules Strongbow. On June 28, the Strongbows won the tag team championship from the team of Mr. Fuji and Mr. Saito in New York City's Madison Square Garden. During the match, special guest referee Ivan Putski counted the winning fall, but did not see Fuji's foot draped over the bottom rope. On the July 13 episode of \"Championship Wrestling\", the Strongbows lost the titles back to Fuji and Saito, but on the October 26 episode of \"Championship Wrestling\", the Strongbows defeated Fuji and Saito for their second WWF Tag Team Championship reign as a team. On the March 8, 1983 episode of \"Championship Wrestling\", the Strongbows lost the titles to The Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika). After failing in regaining the belts, the Strongbows disbanded.\n\nStrongbow retired in 1985, but would still step back into the ring from time to time, most notably for a legends battle royal in East Rutherford, New Jersey in 1987. In retirement, Strongbow became a WWF road agent and worked in the company's front office. He also participated in a 1994 storyline in which he mentored Tatanka (an actual Native American of the Lumbee tribe). Strongbow was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1994 by Gorilla Monsoon. Strongbow's last appearance in WWE was a brief appearance on the November 17, 2008 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" when Stephanie McMahon introduced him to the audience in Atlanta.\n\nHis son, Joe Jr. wrestled in the 1980s and early 1990s mainly as Mark Pyle and Mark Young in the WWF from 1986–1990 and Vince Young in WCW. Joe Jr. died in 2016 at the age of 48. He also has a daughter Connie Pacheco of Portland, Oregon.\n\nScarpa suffered a fall at his home in late 2011 and was hospitalized. He never recovered and died on April 3, 2012 at the age of 83. He is buried in Griffin, Georgia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1198428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1198428", "title": "Congressional Cemetery", "text": "Congressional Cemetery\n\nThe Congressional Cemetery or Washington Parish Burial Ground is a historic and active cemetery located at 1801 E Street, SE, in Washington, D.C., on the west bank of the Anacostia River. It is the only American \"cemetery of national memory\" founded before the Civil War.\nOver 65,000 individuals are buried or memorialized at the cemetery, including many who helped form the nation and the city of Washington in the early 19th century.\n\nThough the cemetery is privately owned, the U.S. government owns 806 burial plots administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Congress, located about a mile and a half (2.4 km) to the northwest, has greatly influenced the history of the cemetery. The cemetery still sells plots, and is an active burial ground. From the Washington Metro, the cemetery lies three blocks east of the Potomac Avenue station and two blocks south of the Stadium-Armory station.\n\nMany members of the U.S. Congress who died while Congress was in session are interred at Congressional Cemetery. Other burials include early landowners and speculators, the builders and architects of early Washington, Native American diplomats, Washington city mayors, and American Civil War veterans. Nineteenth-century Washington, D.C., families unaffiliated with the federal government also have graves and tombs at the cemetery.\n\nIn all, there are one Vice President, one Supreme Court justice, six Cabinet members, 19 Senators and 71 Representatives (including a former Speaker of the House) buried there, as well as veterans of every American war, and the first director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 23, 1969, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2011.\n\nThe Congressional Cemetery was established by private citizens associated with Christ Church on a 4.5 acre plot in 1807 and was later given to Christ Church, which gave it its official name Washington Parish Burial Ground. By 1817 sites were set aside for government legislators and officials; this includes cenotaphs for many legislators buried elsewhere. The cenotaphs, designed by Benjamin Latrobe, each have a large square block with recessed panels set on a wider plinth and surmounted by a conical point.\nFrom 1823 to 1876 the U.S. Congress funded the expansion, enhancement, and maintenance of the cemetery, but it never became a federal institution. Appropriations funded a gravel road from the Capitol to the cemetery, paving within the cemetery, the public vault, fencing, and the gatehouse, as well as funerals for congressmen and the cenotaphs. During the early part of this period, graves were laid out in a grid pattern in an extension of the grid in the L'Enfant Plan for Washington, and little or no landscaping or plantings were made on the grounds. The grid survives to this day and was extended as the cemetery expanded.\n\nStarting in the late 1840s, the cemetery was influenced by the rural cemetery movement in which the graves were placed in a park-like setting with extensive landscaping. To implement this new vision, the cemetery needed to expand.\n\nBetween 1849 and 1869 the cemetery grew in area to 35.75 acres. The original cemetery was located on block 1115 on E Street between 18th and 19th Streets Southeast in 1808. In 1849, it doubled in size by acquiring the block to its south, 1116. In 1853, it expanded to the east on blocks 1130, 1148 and 1149 between F and G Streets Southeast. In 1853-53, the cemetery expanded to the west by acquiring block 1104, between 17th Street and 18th Streets Southeast. In 1858, the cemetery acquired block 1105 and Reservation 13. In 1859, it added blocks 1105 and 1123. Finally, the cemetery reached its current extent of 35.75 acres by growing south to Water Street Southeast with blocks 1106 and 1117 in 1869.\nEventually the land to the south of the cemetery was transferred to the National Park Service although the access road to the RFK Stadium parking lot is administered by the DC Sports and Entertainment Commission. In the 1950s, it appeared that the southeast corner of the cemetery would become a part of the right of way for the Southeast-Southwest Freeway. However, protracted environmental litigation halted construction at Pennsylvania Avenue, with the dead end of the freeway being connected by a temporary road to the RFK parking lot and to 17th Street Southeast at the southwest corner of the cemetery.\n\nAfter 1876 the cemetery was seldom used or supported by Congress. Nevertheless, many wealthy Washingtonians continued to bury family members there, and figures associated with the government who were local residents, such as Marine Corps Band Director John Philip Sousa and J. Edgar Hoover, were buried there. By the 1970s urban decay, the declining membership of Christ Church, and the declining value of the endowment funded by Christ Church, left the cemetery in serious difficulties. Monuments and burial vaults were in disrepair. Maintenance on buildings had been long delayed. There was no paid staff and minimal funding. Drug dealers and prostitutes began to occupy the cemetery. \nThe cemetery is still owned by Christ Church but since 1976 it has been managed by the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery (APHCC). Progress on the renovation was very slow until two volunteers became involved. Jim Oliver, then assistant manager of the House Republican Cloakroom, became involved in the late 1980s and helped revive congressional interest in the cemetery. The K-9 Corps, a group of dog owners whose activities helped drive away the drug dealers, was organized in 1997.\n\nRenovation picked-up after C-SPAN broadcast a video on the cemetery on July 5, 1996. The following weekend 100 airmen from Andrews Air Force Base arrived unannounced to mow the 35-acre lawn, and a contingent from the Army post at Fort Belvoir followed the next month. A Joint Service Day involving all five branches of the U.S. military has since become an annual tradition. In 2013, a record 328 people participated.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation included the cemetery on its 1997 list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places and many gifts and donations were soon received. Congress gave $1 million in matching funds in 1999 to create an endowment for basic maintenance, and a 2002 Congressional appropriation funds restoration.\n\nThe APHCC now hosts over 1,000 volunteers each year working on a wide variety of projects: from planting bulbs to resetting tombstones to pruning trees, adopting and landscaping individual plots, providing research, and writing a quarterly newsletter. Events hosted by the APHCC have included free guided tours on Saturdays, Christmas caroling, Christ Church's Easter services, book signings, Pride 5k race and Dead Man's Run 5k race, Day of the Dog Festival, Ghosts & Goblets Gala, and much more.\n\nIn August 2013 the cemetery began using goats to eat and clear the surrounding wooded area of poison ivy, English ivy, grass, and other plants. The 58 \"eco-goats\", which cost $4,000, are considered more ecologically friendly than mowers and pesticides and provide fertilizer as well. It was the first use of goats inside the beltway. The use of the goats drew widespread international attention and televised reports on BBC World News, Nat Geo, News Hour, NBC Nightly News, Tokyo TV, China CCTV, and Al-Jazeera.\n\nIn the May 2013, Congressional Cemetery hired Topographix, a firm which surveys cemeteries using ground-penetrating radar, to document burials in the cemetery. Although the cemetery had excellent records going back to its founding, many burial sites lacked a marker or had the marker removed or stolen. Additionally, subsidence of some areas and buckling in others changed the location of graves. The last time Congressional Cemetery was accurately and completely mapped was 1935. By the end of 2013, about half the cemetery had been mapped, revealing a potential 2,750 unmarked burial sites. Cemetery staff said many of these burials are probably recorded, but some may be new discoveries. Congressional Cemetery officials said they were one of only 12 cemeteries in the city still accepting burials, and the mapping project would allow it to identify unused space. The mapping project will be completed in the spring of 2014, and the cemetery said it would use the results to release a mobile phone app which will allow users to search for and locate graves on their own.\n\nThe Congressional Cemetery is a National Historic Landmark Historic District with 9 contributing structures and 186 contributing objects built from 1817 to 1876. Later structures and objects are considered to be \"non-contributing\" even if they are significant in the cemetery's current appearance.\n\nOf the 186 contributing objects, 168 are the nearly identical Congressional cenotaphs, believed to have been designed by the Architect of the Capitol Benjamin Latrobe. As used at the Congressional Cemetery, the term \"cenotaph\" includes not only monuments to those buried elsewhere, but also to the Latrobe monuments that mark the actual graves of representatives and senators. Some congressmen are buried under a cenotaph, some are buried without one in a different area of the cemetery, and for some the marker is a true cenotaph. James Gillespie (1747–1805) who was reinterred in 1892, has a separate grave and cenotaph.\n\nA cenotaph was erected for each congressman who died in office from 1833 to 1876. The first was for Rep. James Lent. After Congress appropriated funds and his monument was ordered, his family reinterred the body in New York. Congress erected the monument in 1839 anyway, establishing the tradition of erecting cenotaphs.\nThe cenotaphs are constructed of Aquia sandstone, as are the White House and the Capitol, and were likewise painted white, forming a visual connections with these nearby symbols of Federal government, and a contrast to the surrounding gravestones. They are grouped in rows in the older part of the cemetery where they dominate the landscape.\n\nAfter the Civil War very few congressmen were buried in the cemetery, as their bodies were commonly shipped to their home states or buried in the new National Cemeteries such as Arlington National Cemetery. Cenotaphs were discontinued in 1876 after Massachusetts Senator George Frisbie Hoar stated that \"the thought of being buried beneath one of those atrocities brought new terror to death.\"\n\nWilliam Thornton, who served as Architect of the Capitol before Latrobe, is the only person honored with a cenotaph who did not serve as a congressman. Former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill was honored with a cenotaph in 1994, though it is not in the style of a Latrobe cenotaph. After a 1972 plane crash in which their bodies were lost, Hale Boggs and Nicholas Begich share a cenotaph. These are the only cenotaphs erected since 1876.\nThe Public Vault is an early classical revival structure built 1832-34 with Federal funds to store the bodies of government officials before burial.\nA classical marble facade with baroque scrolls decorate the partially subterranean vault. Double wrought iron doors have the words \"PUBLIC VAULT\" displayed by means of vent holes. Temporary residents of this vault have included three U.S. presidents: John Quincy Adams (1848), William Henry Harrison (1841), and Zachary Taylor (1850). President Harrison stayed in the vault for three months, three times longer than the time he spent as president.\n\nFirst Lady Dolley Madison was interred in the Public Vault for two years, the longest known interment in the vault, while funds were being raised for her re-interment at Montpelier. Her body was transferred to Causten family vault, located directly across the path from the Public Vault, for another six years before the funds were raised. First Lady Louisa Catherine Adams has been reported as having been interred in the Public Vault, but other sources report that she was interred in the Causten family vault.\n\nLegend says that Lewis Powell spent a night in the vault while avoiding pursuit for his role in the assassination of President Lincoln.\n\nIn 1864 an explosion at the nearby Washington Arsenal killed a woman supervisor and 20 teenage girls, most of them Irish, who worked packing explosives and cartridges. President Lincoln led the funeral procession to the cemetery and attended the graveside ceremonies. Later a monument was erected over the graves of 16 of the victims. A sculpture of a grieving young woman stands atop a marble column on the monument. Local artist, Lot Flannery of the Flannery Brothers Marble Manufacturers, sculpted the monument.\n\nSeveral nationally important or otherwise remarkable funerals have taken place at the Congressional Cemetery. These funerals featured long formal processions starting at the White House or the Capitol, moving down Pennsylvania Avenue to E Street SE, and thence to the cemetery. Parts of this road were specially funded by Congress to facilitate these processions. The form and protocol of these funerals formed the basis for later U.S. state funerals, including those of Presidents Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy.\n\nThese funerals include those held to honor:\n\n\nThe cemetery is administered by the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery (APHCC), which is a non-profit corporation headed by a 15-member Board of Directors. The association has five full-time employees, one part-time archivist, and over 500 volunteers. The APHCC named Paul K. Williams President in July 2012. Its mission is:\nTo serve the community as an active burial ground and conserve the physical artifacts, buildings, and infrastructure of the cemetery; to celebrate the American heritage represented by those interred here; to restore and sustain the landscape, to protect the Anacostia River watershed, and to manage the grounds as an accessible community resource.\n\nIn 2009, the association retained the Oehme, van Sweden & Associates to develop a new landscape plan. The cemetery has approximately 2,000 plots available for sale. On March 20, 2014, the cemetery received its green burial certification from the Green Burial Council. Green burials are allowed in any plot in the cemetery.\n\nCongressional Cemetery is also known for allowing members of the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery (APHCC) to walk dogs off-leash on the cemetery grounds. In addition to their membership dues, K-9 Corps members pay a fee for the privilege of walking their dogs. K-9 Corps members provide about 20% of Congressional Cemetery's operating income. Dog walkers follow a set of rules and regulations and provide valuable volunteer time to restore the cemetery.\n\nThe K-9 Corps program is recognized as providing the impetus for the revitalization of Congressional Cemetery, which had fallen into neglect prior to the program's creation. In 2008, the association restricted K-9 membership, placing restrictions on dogwalkers as the program became more popular. The K-9 Corps program has been nationally recognized for creative use of urban green space.\n\n\n\n"}

It also touches upon criticism against the phrase itself, which was branded as a misnomer. The notion of a \"war\" against \"terrorism\" has proven highly contentious, with critics charging that participating governments exploited it to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives, reduce civil liberties, and infringe upon human rights. It is argued that the term war is not appropriate in this context (as in War on Drugs), since there is no identifiable enemy and that it is unlikely international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.\n\nOther critics, such as Francis Fukuyama, note that \"terrorism\" is not an enemy, but a tactic: calling it a \"war on terror\" obscures differences between conflicts such as anti-occupation insurgents and international mujahideen. With a military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan and its associated collateral damage Shirley Williams maintains this increases resentment and terrorist threats against the West. Other criticism include United States hypocrisy, media induced hysteria, and that changes in American foreign and security policy have shifted world opinion against the US.\n\nVarious critics dubbed the term \"War on Terror\" as nonsensical.\nFor example, billionaire activist investor George Soros criticized the term \"War on Terror\" as a \"false metaphor.\" \nLinguist George Lakoff of the Rockridge Institute argued that there cannot literally be a on terror, since is an abstract noun. \"Terror cannot be destroyed by weapons or signing a peace treaty. A war on terror has no end.\"\n\nJason Burke, a journalist who writes about radical Islamic activity, describes the terms \"terrorism\" and \"war against terrorism\" in this manner:\n\nThere are multiple ways of defining terrorism and all are subjective. Most define terrorism as 'the use or threat of serious violence' to advance some kind of 'cause'. Some state clearly the kinds of group ('sub-national', 'non-state') or cause (political, ideological, religious) to which they refer. Others merely rely on the instinct of most people when confronted with an act that involves innocent civilians being killed or maimed by men armed with explosives, firearms or other weapons. None is satisfactory and grave problems with the use of the term persist.\n\nTerrorism is after all, a tactic. The term 'war on terrorism' is thus effectively nonsensical. As there is no space here to explore this involved and difficult debate, my preference is, on the whole, for the less loaded term 'militancy'. This is not an attempt to condone such actions, merely to analyze them in a clearer way.\n\nFormer U.S. President George W. Bush articulated the goals of the War on Terror in a September 20, 2001 speech, in which he said that it \"will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.\" In that same speech, he called the war \"a task that does not end\", an argument he reiterated in 2006 State of The Union address.\n\nOne justification given for the invasion of Iraq was to prevent terroristic, or other attacks, by Iraq on the United States or other nations. This can be viewed as a conventional warfare realization of the War on Terror.\n\nA major criticism leveled at this justification is that it does not fulfill one of the requirements of a just war and that in waging war preemptively, the United States undermined international law and the authority of the United Nations, particularly the United Nations Security Council. On this ground, by invading a country that did not pose an imminent threat without UN support, the U.S. violated international law, including the UN Charter and the Nuremberg principles, therefore committing a war of aggression, which is considered a war crime. Additional criticism raised the point that the United States might have set a precedent, under the premise of which any nation could justify the invasion of other states.\n\nRichard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, argues that on the eve of U.S. intervention in 2003, Iraq represented, at best, a gathering threat and not an imminent one. In hindsight he notes that Iraq did not even represent a gathering threat. \"The decision to attack Iraq in March 2003 was discretionary: it was a war of choice. There was no vital American interests in imminent danger and there were alternatives to using military force, such as strengthening existing sanctions.\" However, Haass argues that U.S. intervention in Afghanistan in 2001 began as a war of necessity—vital interests were at stake—but morphed \"into something else and it crossed a line in March 2009, when President Barack Obama` decided to sharply increase American troop levels and declared that it was U.S. policy to 'take the fight to the Taliban in the south and east' of the country.\" Afghanistan, according to Haass, eventually became a war of choice.\n\nExcerpts from an April 2006 report compiled from sixteen U.S. government intelligence agencies has strengthened the claim that engaging in Iraq has increased terrorism in the region.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, critics have claimed that the Blair government used the War on Terror as a pretext to radically curtail civil liberties, some enshrined in law since Magna Carta. For example, the detention-without-trial in Belmarsh prison: controls on free speech through laws against protests near Parliament and laws banning the \"glorification\" of terrorism: and reductions in checks on police power, as in the case of Jean Charles de Menezes and Mohammed Abdul Kahar.\n\nFormer Liberal Democrat Leader Sir Menzies Campbell has also condemned Blair's inaction over the controversial U.S. practice of extraordinary rendition, arguing that the human rights conventions to which the UK is a signatory (e.g. European Convention on Human Rights) impose on the government a \"legal obligation\" to investigate and prevent potential torture and human rights violations.\n\nU.S. President George W. Bush's remark of November 2001 claiming that \"You're either with us or you are with the terrorists,\" has been a source of criticism. Thomas A. Keaney of Johns Hopkins University's Foreign Policy Institute said \"it made diplomacy with a number of different countries far more difficult because obviously there are different problems throughout the world.\"\n\nSince the War on Terror revolved primarily around the United States and other NATO states intervening in the internal affairs of Muslim countries (i.e. in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.) and organisations, it has been labelled a war against Islam by ex-United States Attorney General Ramsey Clark, among others. \nAfter his release from Guantanamo in 2005, ex-detainee Moazzam Begg appeared in the Islamist propaganda video \"21st Century CrUSAders\" and claimed the U.S. was engaging in a new crusade:\n\nI think that history is definitely repeating itself and for the Muslim world and I think even a great part of the non-Muslim world now, are beginning to recognize that there are ambitions that the United States has on the lands and wealth of nations of Islam.\n\nUniversity of Chicago professor and political scientist, Robert Pape has written extensive work on suicide terrorism and states that it is triggered by military occupations, not extremist ideologies. In works such as \"\" and \"Cutting the Fuse\", he uses data from an extensive terrorism database and argues that by increasing military occupations, the US government is increasing terrorism. Pape is also the director and founder of the Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism (CPOST), a database of every known suicide terrorist attack from 1980 to 2008.\n\nIn 2006, a National Intelligence Estimate stated that the war in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism. The estimate was compiled by 16 intelligence agencies and was the first assessment of global terrorism since the start of the Iraq war.\n\nCornelia Beyer explains how terrorism increased as a response to past and present military intervention and occupation, as well as to 'structural violence'. Structural violence, in this instance, refers to economic conditions of backwardness which are attributed to the economic policies of the Western nations, the United States in particular.\n\nBritish Liberal Democrat politician Shirley Williams wrote that the United States and United Kingdom governments \"must stop to think whether it is sowing the kind of resentment which is the seedbed of future terrorism.\" The United Kingdom ambassador to Italy, Ivor Roberts, echoed this criticism when he stated that President Bush was \"the best recruiting sergeant ever for al Qaeda.\" \nThe United States also granted \"protected persons\" status under the Geneva Convention to the Mojahedin-e-Khalq, an Iranian group classified by the U.S. Department of State as a terrorist organization, sparking criticism. Other critics further noted that the American government granted political asylum to several alleged terrorists and terrorist organizations that seek to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime, while the American government claims to be anti-terrorism.\n\nIn 2018, \"New York Times\" terrorism reporter Rukmini Callimachi said \"there are more terrorists now than there are on the eve of September 11, not less...There are more terror groups now, not less.\"\n\nThe alleged mastermind behind the September 11, 2001 attacks was part of the mujahideen who were sponsored, armed, trained and aided by the CIA to fight the Soviet Union after it intervened in Afghanistan in 1979.\n\nVenezuela accused the U.S. government of having a double standard towards terrorism for giving safe haven to Luis Posada Carriles. Some Americans also commented on the selective use of the term War on Terrorism, including 3 star general William Odom, formerly President Reagan's NSA Director, who wrote:\n\nAs many critics have pointed, out, terrorism is not an enemy. It is a tactic. Because the United States itself has a long record of supporting terrorists and using terrorist tactics, the slogans of today's war on terrorism merely makes the United States look hypocritical to the rest of the world. A prudent American president would end the present policy of \"sustained hysteria\" over potential terrorist attacks..treat terrorism as a serious but not a strategic problem, encourage Americans to regain their confidence and refuse to let al Qaeda keep us in a state of fright.\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and members of his administration indicated they possessed information which demonstrated a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. Published reports of the links began in late December 1998. In January 1999, \"Newsweek\" magazine published a story about Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda joining forces to attack U.S. interests in the Gulf Region. ABC News broadcast a story of this link soon after. The Bush Administration believed there was a possibility of a potential collaboration between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime following the U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan. Amnesty International Secretary General Irene Khan criticized the use of pro-humanitarian arguments by Coalition countries prior to its 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing in an open letter: \"This selective attention to human rights is nothing but a cold and calculated manipulation of the work of human rights activists. Let us not forget that these same governments turned a blind eye to Amnesty International's reports of widespread human rights violations in Iraq before the Gulf War.\"\n\nThe term \"torture by proxy\" is used by some critics to describe situations in which the CIA and other US agencies transferred supposed terrorists, whom they captured during their efforts in the 'War on terrorism', to countries known to employ torture as an interrogation technique. Some also claimed that US agencies knew torture was employed, even though the transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture is a violation of US law. Nonetheless, Condoleezza Rice (then the United States Secretary of State) stated that:the United States has not transported anyone and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.\n\nThis US programme also prompted several official investigations in Europe into alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states, including those related with the so-called War on Terrorism. A June 2006 report from the Council of Europe estimated that 100 people were kidnapped by the CIA on EU territory with the cooperation of Council of Europe members and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centres (\"black sites\"), some located in Europe, utilised by the CIA. According to the separate European Parliament report of February 2007, the CIA has conducted 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where these alleged 'terrorists' could face torture, in violation of article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n\nOne aspect of the criticism regarding the rhetoric justifying the War on Terror was religionism, or more specifically Islamophobia. Theologian Amir Hussain, who studies contemporary Muslims societies in North America, defines this concept as a stereotyping of all followers of Islam as real or potential terrorists due to alleged hateful and violent teaching of their religion. He goes on to argue that \"Islam is reduced to the concept of jihad and Jihad is reduced to terror against the West.\" This line of argument echoes Edward Said’s famous piece \"Orientalism\" in which he argued that the United States sees the Muslims and Arabs in an essentialized caricatures – as oil supplies or potential terrorists.\n\nIn 2002, strong majorities supported the U.S.-led War on Terror in Britain, France, Germany, Japan, India and Russia, according to a sample survey conducted by the Pew Research Center. By 2006, supporters of the effort were in the minority in Britain (49%), Germany (47%), France (43%) and Japan (26%). Although a majority of Russians still supported the War on Terror, that majority had decreased by 21%. Whereas 63% of Spaniards supported the War on Terror in 2003, only 19% of the population indicated support in 2006. 19% of the Chinese population still supports the War on Terror and less than a fifth of the populations of Turkey, Egypt, as well as Jordan support the efforts. The report also indicated that Indian public support for the War on Terror has been stable. Andrew Kohut, while speaking to the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, noted that and according to the Pew Research Center polls conducted in 2004, \"the ongoing conflict in Iraq continues to fuel anti-American sentiments. America’s global popularity plummeted at the start of military action in Iraq and the U.S. presence there remains widely unpopular.\"\n\nMarek Obrtel, former Lieutenant Colonel in Field Hospital with Czech Republic army, returned his medals which he received during his posting in Afghanistan War for NATO operations. He criticized the War on Terror as describing the mission as \"deeply ashamed that I served a criminal organization such as NATO, led by the USA and its perverse interests around the world.\"\n\nResearchers in communication studies and political science found that American understanding of the \"War on Terror\" is directly shaped by how mainstream news media reports events associated with the conflict. In \"Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age\" political communication researcher Jim A. Kuypers illustrated \"how the press failed America in its coverage on the War on Terror.\" In each comparison, Kuypers \"detected massive bias on the part of the press.\" This researcher called the mainstream news media an \"anti-democratic institution\" in his conclusion. \"What has essentially happened since 9/11 has been that Bush has repeated the same themes and framed those themes the same whenever discussing the War on Terror,\" said Kuypers. \"Immediately following 9/11, the mainstream news media (represented by CBS, ABC, NBC, \"USA Today\", \"The New York Times\", as well as \"The Washington Post\") did echo Bush, but within eight weeks it began to intentionally ignore certain information the president was sharing and instead reframed the president's themes or intentionally introduced new material to shift the focus.\"\n\nThis goes beyond reporting alternate points of view, which is an important function of the press. \"In short,\" Kuypers explained, \"if someone were relying only on the mainstream media for information, they would have no idea what the president actually said. It was as if the press were reporting on a different speech.\" The study is essentially a \"comparative framing analysis.\" Overall, Kuypers examined themes about 9-11 and the War on Terror that President Bush used and compared them to themes that the press used when reporting on what he said.\n\n\"Framing is a process whereby communicators, consciously or unconsciously, act to construct a point of view that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner,\" wrote Kuypers. These findings suggest that the public is misinformed about government justification and plans concerning the War on Terror.\n\nOthers have also suggested that press coverage contributed to a public confused and misinformed on both the nature and level of the threat to the U.S. posed by terrorism. In his book, \"Trapped in the War on Terror\" political scientist Ian S. Lustick, claimed, \"The media have given constant attention to possible terrorist-initiated catastrophes and to the failures and weaknesses of the government's response.\" Lustick alleged that the War on Terror is disconnected from the real but remote threat terrorism poses and that the generalized War on Terror began as part of the justification for invading Iraq, but then took on a life of its own, fueled by media coverage. Scott Atran writes that \"publicity is the oxygen of terrorism\" and the rapid growth of international communicative networks renders publicity even more potent, with the result that \"perhaps never in the history of human conflict have so few people with so few actual means and capabilities frightened so many.\"\n\nMedia researcher Stephen D. Cooper's analysis of media criticism \"Watching the Watchdog: Bloggers As the Fifth Estate\" contains several examples of controversies concerning mainstream reporting of the War on Terror. Cooper found that bloggers' criticisms of factual inaccuracies in news stories or bloggers' discovery of the mainstream press' failure to adequately verify facts before publication caused many news organizations to retract or change news stories.\n\nCooper found that bloggers specializing in criticism of media coverage advanced four key points:\n\nDavid Barstow won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting by connecting the Department of Defense to over 75 retired generals supporting the Iraq War on television and radio networks. The Department of Defense recruited retired generals to promote the war to the American public. Barstow also discovered undisclosed links between some retired generals and defense contractors. He reported that \"the Bush administration used its control over access of information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse\".\n\nThe Director of Public Prosecutions and head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the UK, Ken McDonald, Britain's most senior criminal prosecutor, stated that those responsible for acts of terrorism such as the 7 July 2005 London bombings are not \"soldiers\" in a war, but \"inadequates\" who should be dealt with by the criminal justice system. He added that a \"culture of legislative restraint\" was needed in passing anti-terrorism laws and that a \"primary purpose\" of the violent attacks was to tempt countries such as Britain to \"abandon our values.\" He stated that in the eyes of the UK criminal justice system, the response to terrorism had to be \"proportionate and grounded in due process and the rule of law\":\nLondon is not a battlefield. Those innocents who were murdered...were not victims of war. And the men who killed them were not, as in their vanity they claimed on their ludicrous videos, 'soldiers'. They were deluded, narcissistic inadequates. They were criminals. They were fantasists. We need to be very clear about this. On the streets of London there is no such thing as a war on terror. The fight against terrorism on the streets of Britain is not a war. It is the prevention of crime, the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by their infringement.\n\nStella Rimington, former head of the British intelligence service MI5 criticised the War on Terror as a \"huge overreaction\" and had decried the militarization and politicization of U.S. efforts to be the wrong approach to terrorism. David Miliband, former UK foreign secretary, has similarly called the strategy a \"mistake\". Nigel Lawson, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, called for Britain to end its involvement in the War in Afghanistan, describing the mission as \"wholly unsuccessful and indeed counter-productive.\"\n\n"}

He was tried, convicted, and executed by the electric chair in Louisiana for the murder of Louisiana State Police Trooper Donald Cleveland.\n\nThe case received international attention because the defendant was a black man convicted by an all-white jury; had brain damage and tested just above mental retardation; and was age 17 at the time of the crime.\n\nPrejean was the second of four children. When he was two weeks old his parents sent him from their home in Lafayette to live with his aunt and uncle in Houston, Texas. Dalton was unaware of his true parentage until the age of eleven. When Dalton's father left his mother and moved to Houston, the aunt decided that Dalton had to be told that he was not her child. Around this time, he began creating problems of an unknown nature, and was sent to live with his mother in Lafayette.\n\nDalton began skipping his school classes following his return to Lafayette. In March 1972, he was committed to the Louisiana Training Institute for truancy at the insistence of his mother. Released only seven months later, he soon came into conflict with the authorities on charges of burglary, theft, and \"false firearms\". In March 1974, he was committed to the Lafayette Juvenile Youth Authority, a residential program for delinquents. He ran away from that facility after a month; upon his return his commitment was terminated and he was released on probation to his mother.\n\nIn June 1974, Dalton was arrested for the killing of John Doucet, a taxi driver. Dalton admitted the killing and was committed once again to the Louisiana Training Institute. In a later statement about the incident Dalton stated that he and two friends called a cab with the intention of robbing the driver. One of his companions was carrying a gun. The three directed the driver to a quiet part of town and persuaded him to stop while they searched for an address. Dalton insisted on taking the gun from his companion because the other youth appeared to be nervous. Dalton approached the driver, and believing that the driver was reaching for a gun of his own, fired twice and began running. While fleeing he told a passerby to call an ambulance because someone had been shot. Dalton later turned himself in to the police and admitted that he had killed the driver.\n\nA psychiatric evaluation of Dalton was performed in 1974. He was found to be intellectually limited and to have very poor judgment. Dalton was diagnosed as having borderline mental retardation, and it was questionable if he knew the difference between right and wrong. The psychiatrist considered the boy to be \"a definite danger to himself and others, and his dream content suggests that it is a matter of accident that the cab driver was killed rather than the boy being killed. He is equally likely to get himself killed in the near future.\" The psychiatrist therefore recommended a lengthy confinement, followed by transfer to permanent facilities. The juvenile courts had jurisdiction over the defendant until he was twenty-one. The doctor's recommendation would have served to keep the defendant confined until December 1980.\n\nIn 1976, however, another doctor conducted a psychiatric evaluation of the defendant and recommended that he be discharged. He concluded that the defendant's values had changed, but cautioned that \"suitable conditions (should be) imposed to be sure he had adequate supervision and is going to live in a fairly stable environment\". That doctor also suggested that fairly rigid probation requirements be imposed. On December 10, 1976, Prejean was released to the custody of his aunt in Houston, apparently without any probation requirements. Within seven months, Dalton was once more under arrest for murder.\n\nAt about five o'clock in the morning of July 2, 1977, Prejean, his brother Joseph, Michael George, and Michael Broussard left Roger's Nite Club in Lafayette Parish. The four had spent the night drinking in various lounges in the vicinity. They left Roger's Nite Club in a 1966 Chevrolet driven by Dalton, with his brother in the front seat and the other two in the back. The car's taillights were not working, and within a few hundred feet of the lounge, Trooper Cleveland, who was on his way to work driving his police vehicle, signaled the Chevrolet to stop. Prejean and his brother attempted to switch places in the front seat because the defendant had been driving without a license. The trooper noticed the switch and ordered the occupants out of the car. He told Michael George and Michael Broussard to get back in and began to search Joseph Prejean. Dalton Prejean, back in the car, stated in reaction to the trooper's pushing Joseph against the car, over Joseph's protest, \"I don't like the way he's doing my brother.\" Dalton then took a .38 caliber revolver from under the car seat, got out of the car and approached the officer with the gun hidden against his leg. As he neared the trooper he fired without warning. Trooper Cleveland was struck by two bullets and was killed. Dalton and his companions fled the scene but were apprehended several hours later.\n\nDalton was once again given psychological tests during pretrial confinement. On the basis of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, the Stanford Binet Vocabulary Subtest and the Bender-Gestalt Test, Dr. William Hawkins determined that he functioned at the dull normal level in the verbal area but in the borderline mental retardation area in the performance area. He had a verbal IQ of 82 and a performance IQ of 72. His full scale IQ is 76, with a full scale mental age of thirteen years and six months.\n\nDalton Prejean was charged by grand jury indictment with first degree murder in violation of Louisiana Revised Statute 14:30. The trial was transferred from Lafayette Parish to Ouachita Parish because of pretrial publicity. After a three-day bifurcated trial beginning on May 1, 1978, a jury of twelve persons found the defendant guilty as charged and unanimously recommended that the death penalty be imposed.\n\nPrejean's defense lawyers appealed citing mitigating factors of an IQ around 71, schizophrenia with two institutionalizations, and his abandonment as an infant.\n\nThe death penalty appeal reached the US Supreme Court in 1990; in November 1989 it had granted a stay on the eve of his scheduled execution. On April 17, 1990, the Court lifted the stay without comment.\n\nThe European Parliament called for commutation of the sentence and a review of the evidence. A representative for Amnesty International said, \"I doubt that in documented recent world history there is an execution [with] such a pile of reasons not to do it.\".\n\nLouisiana Governor Buddy Roemer declined to commute the death sentence to life in prison, rejecting the recommendation of the parole board. \"On behalf of 780 state troopers, and thousands of police officers who put their lives on the line every day, the execution will proceed.\"\n\nOn May 18, 1990, Prejean was executed in the electric chair at Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.\n\nHis final statement was:\n\nNothing is going to be accomplished. I have peace with myself. I'd like to thank all of those who supported me all these years. I'd also like to thank my loved ones for being strong. . . . My son will be a better person for not letting something like this bring down his life. . . . Keep strong, keep pushing, keep praying. They said it wasn't for the revenge, but it's hard for me to see, to understand. I hope they're happy. So I forfeit my life. I give my love to all. God bless.\n\n\n"}

It was an important catalyst to the end of Korean isolationism in the 19th century. After passing the Keupsa Gate without permission from the Koreans, the United States merchant ship was attacked and fought over for several days before finally being destroyed in Pyongyang.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the Great Powers were eager to open up new trade in Asia and began consolidating trade in China and southeast Asia. Japan was also opened up to trade after Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Uraga Harbor near Edo (modern Tokyo) on 8 July 1853, and under the threat of force Japan signed the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854. As early as 1832, discussions of opening up Korea to trade were made by the captain of , Edmund Roberts, yet in 1844 a draft by the United States Congress was shelved due to lack of interest.\n\nThe first contact between the US and Korea was not hostile. Several Americans who were shipwrecked in Korea in 1855 and 1866 were treated well and sent to China for repatriation. However, the Joseon dynasty court which ruled Korea was well aware of the displacement of the traditional ruling classes of China as a result of the First and the Second Opium Wars and maintained a strict policy of isolationism, forbidding any of those they ruled to trade with the outside world to avoid a similar fate.\n\nDetermined to open Korea for trade, \"General Sherman\" (named for William Tecumseh Sherman) came into Korean waters with goods purchased from the British trading firm Meadows and Co., based in Tientsin (present day Tianjin), China. Upon arriving, the crew of \"General Sherman\" attempted to meet with Korean officials to begin negotiations for a trade treaty. The steamer reportedly carried a cargo of cotton, tin, and glass, and was heavily armed. Only five of the crew and passengers were non-Asians:the ship's owner, W. B. Preston, an American trader; Robert Jermain Thomas, a Protestant missionary acting as a navigator and interpreter; an Englishman named Hogarth; Captain Page; Chief Mate Wilson. The rest of the crew were 13 Chinese and three Malay sailors;; a Chinese shroff is also listed on board.. They departed Chefoo (present day Yantai), China on 9 August and arrived on the coast of Korea on 16 August. \"General Sherman\", assisted by Chinese junks, entered the Taedong River on Korea's west coast, sailing towards Pyongyang, and stopped at the Keupsa Gate on the border between Pyongan and Hwanghae provinces. Yu Wautai, captain of one of the Chinese junks, had accompanied Rev. Thomas on his previous trip to Korea's Hwanghae province. According to Thomas, Yu had 20 years experience trading with Koreans.\n\nLocal officials met Captain Page and communicated well enough to learn the ship was interested in trade. The Koreans refused all trade offers but agreed to provide the crew with food and provisions. Page was told to wait while higher level government officials were consulted. However, \"General Sherman\" went further upriver and anchored west of Pyongyang. Due to the previous month's rains and the tides, the depth of the Taedong River was unusually high and this allowed the steamer into Pyongyang.\n\nPark Gyu-su (the governor of Pyongyang) sent his Adjutant-General, Yi Hyon-Ik, to provide the crew with food, but told the captain he should have stayed at the Keupsa Gate. He was again ordered to wait while the Korean ruler was consulted. At the time Korea was ruled by a regent, the Heungseon Daewongun, in the name of his minor son King Gojong. Father Ridel, a French priest who guided the French invasion party into Korea on 10 September 1866 after the \"General Sherman\" incident, reported to the Westerners in China that Daewongun, the regent himself, had sent orders that the ship must leave immediately or all aboard would be killed.\n\nThere is dispute over what happened next. Apparently, the ship's crew seized Adjutant-General Yi and his two deputies, who were attempting to pursue a small boat launched from \"General Sherman\" with six men attempting to reach shore. According to Governor Park's report, another government official, Shin Tae-jung, tried to persuade the crew to release Yi Hyon-ik and his men but failed. Instead, \"General Sherman\" moved upstream, firing cannons and eventually anchored at Hwang-gang-jung (House of Yellow River). Governor Park later reported that the ship had fired her guns into the crowd, killing seven and wounding five. Then, five men launched a boat and navigated north of Pyongyang to determine the river's depth. The citizens of Pyongyang gathered on the riverbank, shouting for the release of Yi Hyon-ik. A man in the boat (probably Robert J. Thomas, the only one who spoke Korean) replied they would give the answer if they were allowed inside Pyongyang city. The crowd started throwing stones at the small boat. Korean soldiers shot arrows and guns at the launch, which retreated back to the ship. The Koreans sent a rescue party and managed to free Yi, but his deputies (Yoo Soon-won and Park Chi-young) were killed. The ship eventually turned back and sailed down until she ran aground into Yang-Gak island, an island across from Pyongyang.\n\nFighting continued for four days, after which the Koreans resorted to fire boats, filled with wood, sulphur and saltpeter. The first two failed to inflict any damage, but the third set \"General Sherman\" afire. Unable to stem the flames, the crew jumped into the water.\n\nAccording to the Korean Official historical record, \"Gojong sillok\", there were two survivors from the initial attack, Robert Thomas and Cho Neung-bong, however, they were beaten to death.\n\nIn January 1867 (under Captain Robert W. Schufeldt) attempted to investigate the demise of \"General Sherman,\" but bad weather turned her back. In the spring of 1868 (under Captain John C. Febiger) reached the Taedong River's mouth and received an official letter acknowledging the death of all crewmen of \"General Sherman\".\n\nConcern over this incident is often erroneously cited as a reason why the U.S. Navy conducted the 1871 Korea Campaign, which resulted in the death of about 300 Korean soldiers and three Americans, but official records at the time do not support that. Five years later Korea was forced to sign a trade treaty with Japan in a separate incident, and in 1882 finally signed a treaty with the United States promising to abide by international norms regarding the treatment of prisoners. These treaties ended several centuries of isolationism.\n\nSome Koreans have claimed that the real purpose of \"General Sherman\" was to seek treasures buried in the royal tombs near Pyongyang. Onboard the ship was a Chinese inspector of gold and silver, whose presence can only be explained by the fact that \"General Sherman\" was planning for burglary of precious metals from a king's tomb near Pyongyang. The ship did not even possess proper records of the items listed for trade, pointing to an ulterior motive. Another supporting factor of this claim is that Robert Jermain Thomas, the ship's interpreter, asked a Korean undercover officer the whereabouts of a white pagoda, which is usually associated with worship. However, in China, it was believed that the royal coffins in the tombs of Pyongyang, where more than one dynasty of Korea lay buried, were of solid gold, and after the departure of \"General Sherman\" to Korea, it was rumored among Westerners in China that \"General Sherman\"'s expedition had something to do with these treasures. \n\nThe Koreans believed the use of an armed metal-hull gunboat was suspicious in a mission simply for trade. Even among Westerners residing in China, there were concerns regarding \"General Sherman\" being heavily armed. It was well known that two months prior to the \"General Sherman\" incident, an armed vessel captained by Ernst Oppert, a German, had visited Korea and made the same demand for trade. Trade had been refused, but Oppert and his crewmen had been well treated and returned to China safely. Oppert returned to Korea in \"Emperor\", which steamed up the Han River near Seoul on the same day that \"General Sherman\" left Chefoo. Oppert's request for trade was denied and he returned to China without incident. \"Surprise\", an American ship, had been shipwrecked in Chulsan, in Pyong-an Province, on 24 June 1866. The crew was not harmed and was sent to China by Governor Park Gyu-su, the same official in charge during the \"General Sherman\" incident.\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, North Korea's government historians began to claim the attack on \"General Sherman\" was planned and led by Kim Hyong-jik, a direct ancestor of North Korean president Kim Il-sung. The claim has no confirmation in historical records but is still being repeated in North Korean publications, including textbooks. In 2006, North Korea issued a postage stamp commemorating the sinking of the merchant vessel.\n\n, a U.S. Navy intelligence ship captured by North Korea in 1968 (and the only U.S. warship still being held in captivity), was formerly moored at what is believed to be the spot where the incident took place. In late 2012, however, the ship was relocated to the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "161772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161772", "title": "Godolphin Arabian", "text": "Godolphin Arabian\n\nThe Godolphin Arabian (–1753), also known as the Godolphin Barb, was an Arabian horse or Barb horse who was one of three stallions that founded the modern Thoroughbred (the others were the Darley Arabian and the Byerley Turk). He was named after his best-known owner, Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin.\n\nThe Godolphin Arabian was foaled about 1724 in Yemen and moved several times before reaching England. At some early age he was exported, probably via Syria, to the stud of the Bey of Tunis. From there he was given to Louis XV of France in 1730. It is believed he was a present from monarch to monarch. Even so, he was not valued by his new French owner, and it is believed he was used as a carthorse.\n\nThe horse was then imported from France by Edward Coke and sent to his stud at Longford Hall, Derbyshire where he remained until the death of his owner in 1733.\n\nHe was bequeathed to Roger Williams, \"proprietor of the St. James's Coffee House\", who inherited Coke's stallions. He was bought by the 2nd Earl of Godolphin, and placed at his stud at Babraham, Cambridgeshire, until his death on Christmas Day 1753.\n\nThe Godolphin Arabian was a bay colour with some white on the off heel behind. He stood at and was distinguished by an unnaturally high crest which is noticeable from portraits of the horse. Most of his immediate offspring were also bay.\n\nThe veterinary surgeon Osmer described the Godolphin Arabian in the following manner:\n\nControversy exists over the ancestry of this horse; some writers referred to him as a Barb, but Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth of the Crabbet Arabian Stud concludes that it is most widely believed that he was an Arabian or had primarily Arabian lineage.\n\n\"Barb\" is a reference to his believed country of origin, Tunisia, on the Barbary Coast. Whyte in the 1840 \"History of the British Turf\", refers to the horse as \"The Godolphin Barb, or \"as he has been improperly called\", the Godolphin Arabian\" (emphasis added) before further clarifying, \"he was long considered an Arabian, although his points resembled more those of the highest breed of Barbs.\" However, portraits showing a horse with a high-carried tail and dished profile, features that differentiate the two types, lead modern experts to believe he was more likely an Arabian. The confusion is understandable, but while the breeds have some characteristics in common and are distantly related, their phenotypes are quite distinct. There was also an argument raised that he was actually a Turkomen, merely called an Arabian in order to raise the stud fee.\n\nThe Earl of Godolphin referred to the horse as an Arabian, and he was described as such by the painter George Stubbs. Lord Godolphin later bought a second stallion in 1750. This one he clearly called a \"barb\". Both were of a similar bay colour but the Barb had a star. Godolphin later bought a grey Barb, which has also caused some confusion over the years.\n\nRecent DNA studies disprove the theory that he was a Barb, as his descendants' Y-DNA traces to the same general haplotype as the Darley Arabian, though to different sub-groups and there are relatively few male-line descendants of the Goldophin Arabian today. This group may have been of Turkoman horse or Arabian origins, as modern horses of both breeds have been linked to this haplotype.\n\nThe Godolphin Arabian was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1738, 1745 and 1747.\n\nOriginally, this small stallion was considered inferior to the larger European horses of the time and was not meant to be put to stud. Instead he was used as 'teaser', a stallion used to gauge the mare's receptiveness. This changed when Lady Roxana, a mare brought to the stud specifically to be bred to a stallion called Hobgoblin, rejected her intended mate, and so the Godolphin Arabian was allowed to cover her instead.\n\nThe result of this mating was Lath, the first of his offspring, who went on to win the Queen's Plate nine times out of nine at the Newmarket races. The second colt from this pair was Cade, and the third was Regulus. All three were the same gold-touched bay as their sire, with the same small build and high crested conformation. All were exceptionally fast on the track, and went on to sire many foals themselves. This was the start of the Godolphin Arabian's prowess as a racing stud, and he spent the rest of his days as the Earl of Godolphin's prize stallion, bred to England's finest mares.\n\nThe American connection began with the filly Selima (born in 1745 out of Shireborn). She was purchased by Benjamin Tasker Jr. of the Province of Maryland in Colonial America, carried to the new world, and raced between 1750 and 1753. She won the biggest prize of the era, 2,500 pistoles at Gloucester, Virginia which marked \"the beginning of the remarkable racing contests between the rival colonies of Maryland and Virginia.\" After this, she became a successful broodmare at the Belair Stud in Collington, Maryland.\n\nThe major Thoroughbred sire Eclipse traces in his sire line to the Darley Arabian, but his dam was a daughter of Regulus and thus also traces to the Godolphin Arabian. This pattern continues to be seen today, with the Godolphin Arabian more heavily represented in dam lines and in the \"middle\" of pedigrees as opposed to direct sire lines.\n\nThe Godolphin Arabian died on the Gog Magog hills Cambridgeshire in 1753, aged around 29. The horse's grave in the stable block of Wandlebury House can be visited. When he was interred, the occasion was marked with ale and cake.\n\nAlthough today the majority of Thoroughbred horses’ sire lines trace to the Darley Arabian, many famous North American horses of the past trace their sire line back to the Godolphin Arabian. These include Seabiscuit, Man o' War, War Admiral, and Silky Sullivan. Today, the sire line is primarily supported by descendants of Relaunch and his son Cee's Tizzy through dual Breeders' Cup Classic winner Tiznow.\n\nIn Europe, his influence survives mainly through the 2,000 Guineas winner Known Fact, and his son, the champion miler Warning. This line has produced outstanding sprinters such as Diktat (Haydock Sprint Cup), Avonbridge and Dream Ahead. The Derby has not been won by a sire line descendant of the Godolphin Arabian since Santa Claus in 1964 and is nowadays dominated by descendants of the Darley Arabian.\n\n\"King of the Wind\" (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1948) is a fictional biography of the Godolphin Arabian by American author Marguerite Henry. She wrote many books about horses for children, and perhaps is best known for \"Misty of Chincoteague\" and its sequels. She won the Newbery Medal for \"King of the Wind\", recognizing it as the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\". \"Misty\" became a film in 1961, but \"King of the Wind\" had to wait till 1990 for its adaptation, with Navin Chowdhry as the Arabian's lifetime stable boy Agba.\n\nIn the novel, the Godolphin Arabian was foaled in Morocco and was called Sham. He came to Europe as a diplomatic gift to King Louis XV of France but, due to his poor condition on arrival and relatively small size, was given to the cook as a cart horse. He was soon sold to a woodcarter in Paris, where he was treated poorly and then purchased by the Quaker Edward Coke of Holkham Hall, older brother of the 1st Earl of Leicester 5th Creation, then sold to Francis, Earl of Godolphin, who maintained a stud in Suffolk, near the racing town of Newmarket.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the fifth to bear the title of King of the Jews, but in practice he ruled as a Roman client. Agrippa was overthrown by his Jewish subjects in 66 and supported the Roman side in the First Jewish–Roman War.\n\nHerod Agrippa II was the son of the first and better-known Herod Agrippa, the brother of Berenice, Mariamne, and Drusilla (second wife of the Roman procurator Antonius Felix).. He was educated at the court of the emperor Claudius, and at the time of his father's death he was only seventeen years old. Claudius therefore kept him at Rome, and sent Cuspius Fadus as procurator of the Roman province of Judaea. While at Rome, he voiced his support for the Jews to Claudius, and against the Samaritans and the procurator of Iudaea Province, Ventidius Cumanus, who was lately thought to have been the cause of some disturbances there.\n\nOn the death of king Herod of Chalcis in 48, his small Syrian kingdom of Chalcis was given to Agrippa, with the right of superintending the Temple in Jerusalem and appointing its high priest, but only as a tetrarchy.\n\nIn 53, Agrippa was forced to give up the tetrarchy of Chalcis but in exchange Claudius made him ruler with the title of king over the territories previously governed by Philip, namely, Batanea, Trachonitis and Gaulonitis, and the kingdom of Lysanias in Abila. The tetrarchy of Chalcis was subsequently in 57 given to his cousin, Aristobulus. Herod Agrippa celebrated by marrying off his two sisters Mariamne and Drusilla. Flavius Josephus, the Jewish historian, repeats the gossip that Agrippa lived in an incestuous relationship with his sister, Berenice.\n\nIn 55, the Emperor Nero added to Agrippa's realm the cities of Tiberias and Taricheae in Galilee, and Livias (Iulias), with fourteen villages near it, in Peraea.\nIt was before Agrippa and his sister Berenice that, according to the New Testament, Paul the Apostle pleaded his case at Caesarea Maritima, possibly in 59.\n\nAgrippa expended large sums in beautifying Jerusalem and other cities, especially Berytus (ancient Beirut), a Hellenised city in Phoenicia. His partiality for the latter rendered him unpopular amongst his own subjects, and the capricious manner in which he appointed and deposed the high priests made him disliked by his coreligionists.\n\nIn the seventeenth year of Agrippa's reign (corresponding with the 12th year of Nero's reign), Agrippa tried desperately to avert a war with Rome, when he saw his countrymen generally disposed to fight against Rome, because of certain insults and abuses they had had under the Roman procurator, Gessius Florus. At this time, they had broken-off the cloisters leading from Antonia Fortress to the Temple Mount where Roman soldiers were wont to keep guard during the Jewish holidays, and they refused to pay the tribute which was due to Caesar. Agrippa convened the people and urged instead that they tolerate the temporary injustices done to them and submit themselves to Roman hegemony. At length, Agrippa failed to prevent his subjects from rebelling, whereas, during a certain holiday when the Roman governor of Syria, Cestius Gallus, had passed through Judea to quell the rebellion, he was routed by Jewish forces. By 66 the citizenry of Jerusalem expelled their king, Agrippa, and his sister, Berenice, from Jerusalem. During the First Jewish-Roman War of 66–73, he sent 2,000 men, archers and cavalry, to support Vespasian, showing that, although a Jew in religion, he was entirely devoted to the Roman Empire. He accompanied Titus on some campaigns, and was wounded at the siege of Gamla. After the capture of Jerusalem, he went with his sister Berenice to Rome, where he was invested with the dignity of praetor and rewarded with additional territory.\n\nAgrippa had a great intimacy with the historian Josephus, having supplied him with information for his history, \"Antiquities of the Jews\". Josephus preserved two of the letters he received from him.\n\nAccording to Photius, Agrippa died, childless, at the age of seventy, in the third year of the reign of Trajan, that is, 100, but statements of historian Josephus, in addition to the contemporary epigraphy from his kingdom, cast this date into serious doubt. The modern scholarly consensus holds that he died before 93/94. He was the last prince from the House of Herod.\n\n\n\n"}

Orville L. Holley and Myron Holley were his brothers. Their father was the founder of a successful iron business, and was also a farmer and merchant.\n\nHolley began his early studies before the age of four, and finished them by age ten. For the next few years, he studied at home under the tutelage of his father. In 1797, at the age of sixteen, he began preparatory studies at Williams College. He matriculated to Yale in 1799. The son of a Calvinist father and a Baptist mother, Holley had not been brought up to follow either denomination. While attending Yale, he became excited by the religious doctrines of Yale president Timothy Dwight, a staunch opponent of deism. In 1803, earned a Bachelor of Arts degree and delivered a graduation address entitled \"The Slavery of Free Thinking.\"\n\nHolley determined to pursue the profession of law, studying in the office of Riggs & Radcliffe of New York, but abandoned this ambition after only a few short months. He returned to Yale to study divinity under President Dwight. He earned his degree in December 1804, and was licensed to preach by the North Haven Association. On January 1, 1805, he married Mary Austin, a fellow student at Yale who would later publish \"History of Texas\". The couple moved to Fairfield, Connecticut where Holley was ordained by the Western Consociation of Fairfield County, Connecticut on September 13, 1805. That same year, he began to pastor Greenfield Hill Congregationalist church in Fairfield, Connecticut.\n\nDuring his short tenure at Greenfield Hill, Holley's religious views became more liberal, in part due to the influence of his wife, Mary. This shift in his religious views, as well as a desire for a more favorable financial situation, led him to resign his post at Greenfield Hill. He considered posts in Marblehead, Massachusetts; Middletown, Connecticut; and Albany, New York, but ultimately declined them all and moved to Boston in 1808. Shortly before the move, Holley's first child, Harriette Williman Holley, was born. Holley preached several trial sermons to large crowds in the Old South Church. Previously a Trinitarian, by the time Holley accepted the call to become pastor of Hollis Street Church in Boston, he had already become a Unitarian. Holley was installed as pastor on March 8, 1809.\n\nWhile in Boston, Holley developed a reputation as a great orator. He became a member of several benevolent societies, including the Harvard Board of Overseers, the Boston School Committee, and the Washington Benevolent Society. The Washington Benevolent Society was affiliated with the Federalist Party, which Holley supported despite his respect for Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson. Holley served as a chaplain of the House of Representatives during the War of 1812. When Hollis Street Church was constructing a larger building, the congregation met with the congregation from Boston's First Church, and Holley shared the pulpit with William Emerson, father of philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1812. and a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816.\n\nTransylvania University had a long-standing affiliation with the Presbyterian Church, but due to low enrollment and graduation numbers, the Kentucky General Assembly reorganized its Board of Trustees, temporarily diminishing the church's influence. The new board members, mostly men of political influence, believed Horace Holley's liberal religious views would foster academic progress and help realize their dreams of making Lexington the \"Athens of the West.\"\n\nHolley was first invited to become president of Transylvania University in 1815. He at first refused, but the Board of Trustees persisted, and again unanimously extended their invitation to Holley in 1817. Holley was intrigued by the second offer, and on an 1818 visit to Lexington, was given a tour of the city by native son Henry Clay. Impressed by what he saw, Holley accepted the offer to become president in April. He returned to Boston for his wife, daughter, and newborn son, Horace Austin Holley, and in September 1818, the family relocated to Lexington. Holley was inaugurated as president on December 19, 1818.\n\nHolley's tenure at Transylvania was of immense benefit to the university. A new gymnasium and art gallery were opened. The library was substantially expanded. The school was reorganized as a four-year institution, and a medical school and law school were both founded. Holley attracted eminently qualified faculty to the university, including Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. By 1825, the medical school was ranked second in the country, enrollment had quadrupled, and the school had produced 650 graduates. (By comparison, in the period from the university's founding in 1799 to the beginning of Holley's tenure in 1818, it had produced only 60 graduates.)\n\nIn 1825 Holley welcomed Lafayette, who was doing a triumphal tour of the United States and to whom he dedicated one of his writings.\n\nTensions between Holley and the school's conservative Presbyterian leadership did not subside, however. His support of the Federalist Party also cost him a great deal of support in the state. Allegations surfaced regarding everything from fiscal mismanagement to the Holleys' extravagant social life. Public funding for the university dwindled, and in 1826, Holley's salary was cut. He further lost the support of Governor Joseph Desha, who disliked the university for what he perceived as its elitist character and for its association with Henry Clay. Overwhelmed by the opposition, Holley offered his resignation in January 1826, but the Board of Trustees refused to accept it. He resigned again in 1827; this time it was accepted.\n\nFollowing his resignation, Holley moved to New Orleans, where he hoped to take a group of young men on a tour of Europe as part of a \"traveling academy.\" When the parents of the young men refused, Holley was invited to establish a new educational institution in New Orleans. Supporters promised Holley full fiscal and administrative control over the college.\n\nHolley agreed to open the college, but first took leave to Boston to escape the hot climate and build up his health. While on this excursion, Holley and his wife both contracted yellow fever. Ms. Holley was so delirious with fever, she was not aware of her husband's death on July 31, 1827. Holley was buried at sea near the Dry Tortugas in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5219699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5219699", "title": "Human Genome Project", "text": "Human Genome Project\n\nThe Human Genome Project (HGP) was an international scientific research project with the goal of determining the sequence of nucleotide base pairs that make up human DNA, and of identifying and mapping all of the genes of the human genome from both a physical and a functional standpoint. It remains the world's largest collaborative biological project. After the idea was picked up in 1984 by the US government when the planning started, the project formally launched in 1990 and was declared complete on April 14, 2003. Funding came from the US government through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as well as numerous other groups from around the world. A parallel project was conducted outside government by the Celera Corporation, or Celera Genomics, which was formally launched in 1998. Most of the government-sponsored sequencing was performed in twenty universities and research centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Spain and China.\n\nThe Human Genome Project originally aimed to map the nucleotides contained in a human haploid reference genome (more than three billion). The \"genome\" of any given individual is unique; mapping the \"human genome\" involved sequencing a small number of individuals and then assembling these together to get a complete sequence for each chromosome. Therefore, the finished human genome is a mosaic, not representing any one individual.\n\nThe Human Genome Project was a 15-year-long, publicly funded project initiated in 1990 with the objective of determining the DNA sequence of the entire euchromatic human genome within 15 years. In May 1985, Robert Sinsheimer organized a workshop to discuss sequencing the human genome, but for a number of reasons the NIH was uninterested in pursuing the proposal. The following March, the Santa Fe Workshop was organized by Charles DeLisi and David Smith of the Department of Energy's Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER). At the same time Renato Dulbecco proposed whole genome sequencing in an essay in Science. James Watson followed two months later with a workshop held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nThe fact that the Santa Fe workshop was motivated and supported by a Federal Agency opened a path, albeit a difficult and tortuous one, for converting the idea into a public policy in the United States. In a memo to the Assistant Secretary for Energy Research (Alvin Trivelpiece), Charles DeLisi, who was then Director of the OHER, outlined a broad plan for the project. This started a long and complex chain of events which led to approved reprogramming of funds that enabled the OHER to launch the Project in 1986, and to recommend the first line item for the HGP, which was in President Reagan's 1988 budget submission, and ultimately approved by the Congress. Of particular importance in Congressional approval was the advocacy of Senator Peter Domenici, whom DeLisi had befriended. Domenici chaired the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, as well as the Budget Committee, both of which were key in the DOE budget process. Congress added a comparable amount to the NIH budget, thereby beginning official funding by both agencies.\n\nAlvin Trivelpiece sought and obtained the approval of DeLisi's proposal by Deputy Secretary William Flynn Martin. This chart was used in the spring of 1986 by Trivelpiece, then Director of the Office of Energy Research in the Department of Energy, to brief Martin and Under Secretary Joseph Salgado regarding his intention to reprogram $4 million to initiate the project with the approval of Secretary Herrington. This reprogramming was followed by a line item budget of $16 million in the Reagan Administration’s 1987 budget submission to Congress. It subsequently passed both Houses. The Project was planned for 15 years.\n\nCandidate technologies were already being considered for the proposed undertaking at least as early as 1985.\n\nIn 1990, the two major funding agencies, DOE and NIH, developed a memorandum of understanding in order to coordinate plans and set the clock for the initiation of the Project to 1990. At that time, David Galas was Director of the renamed “Office of Biological and Environmental Research” in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science and James Watson headed the NIH Genome Program. In 1993, Aristides Patrinos succeeded Galas and Francis Collins succeeded James Watson, assuming the role of overall Project Head as Director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Human Genome Research (which would later become the National Human Genome Research Institute). A working draft of the genome was announced in 2000 and the papers describing it were published in February 2001. A more complete draft was published in 2003, and genome \"finishing\" work continued for more than a decade.\n\nThe $3-billion project was formally founded in 1990 by the US Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health, and was expected to take 15 years. In addition to the United States, the international consortium comprised geneticists in the United Kingdom, France, Australia, China and myriad other spontaneous relationships. Considering the inflation, the project roughly costed $5 billion.\n\nDue to widespread international cooperation and advances in the field of genomics (especially in sequence analysis), as well as major advances in computing technology, a 'rough draft' of the genome was finished in 2000 (announced jointly by U.S. President Bill Clinton and the British Prime Minister Tony Blair on June 26, 2000). This first available rough draft assembly of the genome was completed by the Genome Bioinformatics Group at the University of California, Santa Cruz, primarily led by then graduate student Jim Kent. Ongoing sequencing led to the announcement of the essentially complete genome on April 14, 2003, two years earlier than planned. In May 2006, another milestone was passed on the way to completion of the project, when the sequence of the last chromosome was published in \"Nature\".\n\nThe project was not able to sequence all the DNA found in human cells. It sequenced only \"euchromatic\" regions of the genome, which make up 92% of the human genome. The other regions, called \"heterochromatic\", are found in centromeres and telomeres, and were not sequenced under the project.\n\nThe Human Genome Project was declared complete in April 2003. An initial rough draft of the human genome was available in June 2000 and by February 2001 a working draft had been completed and published followed by the final sequencing mapping of the human genome on April 14, 2003. Although this was reported to cover 99% of the euchromatic human genome with 99.99% accuracy, a major quality assessment of the human genome sequence was published on May 27, 2004 indicating over 92% of sampling exceeded 99.99% accuracy which was within the intended goal. Further analyses and papers on the HGP continue to occur.\n\nIn March 2009, the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) released a more accurate version of the human genome, but that still left more than 300 gaps.\n\nIn October 2018, the GRC still indicated 514 gaps, most of which are annotated as \"stalled\" or \"under investigation/review\", so it seems they will not be resolved any time soon.\n\nThe sequencing of the human genome holds benefits for many fields, from molecular medicine to human evolution. The Human Genome Project, through its sequencing of the DNA, can help us understand diseases including: genotyping of specific viruses to direct appropriate treatment; identification of mutations linked to different forms of cancer; the design of medication and more accurate prediction of their effects; advancement in forensic applied sciences; biofuels and other energy applications; agriculture, animal husbandry, bioprocessing; risk assessment; bioarcheology, anthropology and evolution. Another proposed benefit is the commercial development of genomics research related to DNA based products, a multibillion-dollar industry.\n\nThe sequence of the DNA is stored in databases available to anyone on the Internet. The U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (and sister organizations in Europe and Japan) house the gene sequence in a database known as GenBank, along with sequences of known and hypothetical genes and proteins. Other organizations, such as the UCSC Genome Browser at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Ensembl present additional data and annotation and powerful tools for visualizing and searching it. Computer programs have been developed to analyze the data, because the data itself is difficult to interpret without such programs. Generally speaking, advances in genome sequencing technology have followed Moore’s Law, a concept from computer science which states that integrated circuits can increase in complexity at an exponential rate. This means that the speeds at which whole genomes can be sequenced can increase at a similar rate, as was seen during the development of the above-mentioned Human Genome Project.\n\nThe process of identifying the boundaries between genes and other features in a raw DNA sequence is called genome annotation and is in the domain of bioinformatics. While expert biologists make the best annotators, their work proceeds slowly, and computer programs are increasingly used to meet the high-throughput demands of genome sequencing projects. Beginning in 2008, a new technology known as RNA-seq was introduced that allowed scientists to directly sequence the messenger RNA in cells. This replaced previous methods of annotation, which relied on inherent properties of the DNA sequence, with direct measurement, which was much more accurate. Today, annotation of the human genome and other genomes relies primarily on deep sequencing of the transcripts in every human tissue using RNA-seq. These experiments have revealed that over 90% of genes contain at least one and usually several alternative splice variants, in which the exons are combined in different ways to produce 2 or more gene products from the same locus.\n\nThe genome published by the HGP does not represent the sequence of every individual's genome. It is the combined mosaic of a small number of anonymous donors, all of European origin. The HGP genome is a scaffold for future work in identifying differences among individuals. Subsequent projects sequenced the genomes of multiple distinct ethnic groups, though as of today there is still only one \"reference genome.\"\n\nKey findings of the draft (2001) and complete (2004) genome sequences include:\n\n\nThe Human Genome Project was started in 1990 with the goal of sequencing and identifying all three billion chemical units in the human genetic instruction set, finding the genetic roots of disease and then developing treatments. It is considered a megaproject because the human genome has approximately 3.3 billion base pairs. With the sequence in hand, the next step was to identify the genetic variants that increase the risk for common diseases like cancer and diabetes.\n\nIt was far too expensive at that time to think of sequencing patients’ whole genomes. So the National Institutes of Health embraced the idea for a \"shortcut\", which was to look just at sites on the genome where many people have a variant DNA unit. The theory behind the shortcut was that, since the major diseases are common, so too would be the genetic variants that caused them. Natural selection keeps the human genome free of variants that damage health before children are grown, the theory held, but fails against variants that strike later in life, allowing them to become quite common (In 2002 the National Institutes of Health started a $138 million project called the HapMap to catalog the common variants in European, East Asian and African genomes).\n\nThe genome was broken into smaller pieces; approximately 150,000 base pairs in length. These pieces were then ligated into a type of vector known as \"bacterial artificial chromosomes\", or BACs, which are derived from bacterial chromosomes which have been genetically engineered. The vectors containing the genes can be inserted into bacteria where they are copied by the bacterial DNA replication machinery. Each of these pieces was then sequenced separately as a small \"shotgun\" project and then assembled. The larger, 150,000 base pairs go together to create chromosomes. This is known as the \"hierarchical shotgun\" approach, because the genome is first broken into relatively large chunks, which are then mapped to chromosomes before being selected for sequencing.\n\nFunding came from the US government through the National Institutes of Health in the United States, and a UK charity organization, the Wellcome Trust, as well as numerous other groups from around the world. The funding supported a number of large sequencing centers including those at Whitehead Institute, the Wellcome Sanger Institute (then called The Sanger Centre) based at the Wellcome Genome Campus, Washington University in St. Louis, and Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) served as an important channel for the involvement of developing countries in the Human Genome Project.\n\nIn 1998, a similar, privately funded quest was launched by the American researcher Craig Venter, and his firm Celera Genomics. Venter was a scientist at the NIH during the early 1990s when the project was initiated. The $300,000,000 Celera effort was intended to proceed at a faster pace and at a fraction of the cost of the roughly $3 billion publicly funded project. The Celera approach was able to proceed at a much more rapid rate, and at a lower cost than the public project because it relied upon data made available by the publicly funded project.\n\nCelera used a technique called whole genome shotgun sequencing, employing pairwise end sequencing, which had been used to sequence bacterial genomes of up to six million base pairs in length, but not for anything nearly as large as the three billion base pair human genome.\n\nCelera initially announced that it would seek patent protection on \"only 200–300\" genes, but later amended this to seeking \"intellectual property protection\" on \"fully-characterized important structures\" amounting to 100–300 targets. The firm eventually filed preliminary (\"place-holder\") patent applications on 6,500 whole or partial genes.\nCelera also promised to publish their findings in accordance with the terms of the 1996 \"Bermuda Statement\", by releasing new data annually (the HGP released its new data daily), although, unlike the publicly funded project, they would not permit free redistribution or scientific use of the data. The publicly funded competitors were compelled to release the first draft of the human genome before Celera for this reason. On July 7, 2000, the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group released a first working draft on the web. The scientific community downloaded about 500 GB of information from the UCSC genome server in the first 24 hours of free and unrestricted access.\n\nIn March 2000, President Clinton announced that the genome sequence could not be patented, and should be made freely available to all researchers. The statement sent Celera's stock plummeting and dragged down the biotechnology-heavy Nasdaq. The biotechnology sector lost about $50 billion in market capitalization in two days.\n\nAlthough the working draft was announced in June 2000, it was not until February 2001 that Celera and the HGP scientists published details of their drafts. Special issues of \"Nature\" (which published the publicly funded project's scientific paper) and \"Science\" (which published Celera's paper) described the methods used to produce the draft sequence and offered analysis of the sequence. These drafts covered about 83% of the genome (90% of the euchromatic regions with 150,000 gaps and the order and orientation of many segments not yet established). In February 2001, at the time of the joint publications, press releases announced that the project had been completed by both groups. Improved drafts were announced in 2003 and 2005, filling in to approximately 92% of the sequence currently.\n\nIn the IHGSC international public-sector HGP, researchers collected blood (female) or sperm (male) samples from a large number of donors. Only a few of many collected samples were processed as DNA resources. Thus the donor identities were protected so neither donors nor scientists could know whose DNA was sequenced. DNA clones from many different libraries were used in the overall project, with most of those libraries being created by Pieter J. de Jong's. Much of the sequence (>70%) of the reference genome produced by the public HGP came from a single anonymous male donor from Buffalo, New York (code name RP11).\n\nHGP scientists used white blood cells from the blood of two male and two female donors (randomly selected from 20 of each) – each donor yielding a separate DNA library. One of these libraries (RP11) was used considerably more than others, due to quality considerations. One minor technical issue is that male samples contain just over half as much DNA from the sex chromosomes (one X chromosome and one Y chromosome) compared to female samples (which contain two X chromosomes). The other 22 chromosomes (the autosomes) are the same for both sexes.\n\nAlthough the main sequencing phase of the HGP has been completed, studies of DNA variation continued in the International HapMap Project, whose goal was to identify patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) groups (called haplotypes, or “haps”). The DNA samples for the HapMap came from a total of 270 individuals: Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria; Japanese people in Tokyo; Han Chinese in Beijing; and the French Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) resource, which consisted of residents of the United States having ancestry from Western and Northern Europe.\n\nIn the Celera Genomics private-sector project, DNA from five different individuals were used for sequencing. The lead scientist of Celera Genomics at that time, Craig Venter, later acknowledged (in a public letter to the journal \"Science\") that his DNA was one of 21 samples in the pool, five of which were selected for use.\n\nIn 2007, a team led by Jonathan Rothberg published James Watson's entire genome, unveiling the six-billion-nucleotide genome of a single individual for the first time.\n\nThe work on interpretation and analysis of genome data is still in its initial stages. It is anticipated that detailed knowledge of the human genome will provide new avenues for advances in medicine and biotechnology. Clear practical results of the project emerged even before the work was finished. For example, a number of companies, such as Myriad Genetics, started offering easy ways to administer genetic tests that can show predisposition to a variety of illnesses, including breast cancer, hemostasis disorders, cystic fibrosis, liver diseases and many others. Also, the etiologies for cancers, Alzheimer's disease and other areas of clinical interest are considered likely to benefit from genome information and possibly may lead in the long term to significant advances in their management.\n\nThere are also many tangible benefits for biologists. For example, a researcher investigating a certain form of cancer may have narrowed down their search to a particular gene. By visiting the human genome database on the World Wide Web, this researcher can examine what other scientists have written about this gene, including (potentially) the three-dimensional structure of its product, its function(s), its evolutionary relationships to other human genes, or to genes in mice or yeast or fruit flies, possible detrimental mutations, interactions with other genes, body tissues in which this gene is activated, and diseases associated with this gene or other datatypes. Further, deeper understanding of the disease processes at the level of molecular biology may determine new therapeutic procedures. Given the established importance of DNA in molecular biology and its central role in determining the fundamental operation of cellular processes, it is likely that expanded knowledge in this area will facilitate medical advances in numerous areas of clinical interest that may not have been possible without them.\n\nThe analysis of similarities between DNA sequences from different organisms is also opening new avenues in the study of evolution. In many cases, evolutionary questions can now be framed in terms of molecular biology; indeed, many major evolutionary milestones (the emergence of the ribosome and organelles, the development of embryos with body plans, the vertebrate immune system) can be related to the molecular level. Many questions about the similarities and differences between humans and our closest relatives (the primates, and indeed the other mammals) are expected to be illuminated by the data in this project.\n\nThe project inspired and paved the way for genomic work in other fields, such as agriculture. For example, by studying the genetic composition of Tritium aestivum, the world’s most commonly used bread wheat, great insight has been gained into the ways that domestication has impacted the evolution of the plant. Which loci are most susceptible to manipulation, and how does this play out in evolutionary terms? Genetic sequencing has allowed these questions to be addressed for the first time, as specific loci can be compared in wild and domesticated strains of the plant. This will allow for advances in genetic modification in the future which could yield healthier, more disease-resistant wheat crops.\n\nAt the onset of the Human Genome Project several ethical, legal, and social concerns were raised in regards to how increased knowledge of the human genome could be used to discriminate against people. One of the main concerns of most individuals was the fear that both employers and health insurance companies would refuse to hire individuals or refuse to provide insurance to people because of a health concern indicated by someone's genes. In 1996 the United States passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) which protects against the unauthorized and non-consensual release of individually identifiable health information to any entity not actively engaged in the provision of healthcare services to a patient.\n\nAlong with identifying all of the approximately 20,000–25,000 genes in the human genome, the Human Genome Project also sought to address the ethical, legal, and social issues that were created by the onset of the project. For that the Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) program was founded in 1990. Five percent of the annual budget was allocated to address the ELSI arising from the project. This budget started at approximately $1.57 million in the year 1990, but increased to approximately $18 million in the year 2014.\n\nWhilst the project may offer significant benefits to medicine and scientific research, some authors have emphasized the need to address the potential social consequences of mapping the human genome. \"Molecularising disease and their possible cure will have a profound impact on what patients expect from medical help and the new generation of doctors' perception of illness.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Versions of the story were popular throughout Europe in the 14th through the 19th centuries.\n\nThe central feature of the story is that a woman is buried or entombed while wearing a valuable ring. Shortly after the burial, a grave robber (often a corrupt sexton) disinters the body with the intent of stealing the ring. The robber is unable to slide the ring off the woman's finger, so he prepares to cut off the finger with a knife. However, upon making the initial incision, the woman awakes, surprising the grave robber. The woman had not been dead at all, but had been the victim of premature burial.\n\nThe following details are included in some versions of the story:\n\nVersions of the story have been found to exist in almost every European country, including Germany, the Netherlands, France, Scandinavia, Italy, England, Scotland, and Ireland. The story is also told about a former resident of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, Canada.\n\nThe most famous version of the story is from Cologne, where the woman has been popularly identified as Richmodis von Aducht, the wife of Menginus von Aducht. The incident was said to have occurred during Black Death year of 1357, though other versions claimed that it occurred in the 16th century. In Richmodstraße in Cologne one can find \"Richmodis House\", birthplace of the composer Max Bruch, where—according to legend—the Aduchts had lived. From a tower two sculpted horseheads look out of a window. These heads by sculptor Wilhelm Müller-Maus were installed in 1958 as a replacement for the wooden ones by Christoph Stephan (1797–1864) that had not survived the bombing of Cologne in World War II.\n\nIn 1920, an ethnologist determined that there were nineteen cities in Germany that claimed that a version of the Lady of the Ring had occurred there, including Hamburg, Lübeck, Dresden, and Freiberg. In eleven of the cases, there were horse sculptures that commemorated the strange ending to the story.\n\nIn 18th-century England, the woman in the story was identified as Emma Edgcumbe, Countess Mount Edgcumbe, wife of George Edgcumbe, 1st Earl of Mount Edgcumbe. However, the century before, Emma's ancestor Lady Anne Edgcumbe was commonly identified as the woman. In England, numerous other ladies with the ring have been identified, including Annot of Benallay, Lady Katherine Wyndham (wife of Sir Edward Wyndham, 2nd Baronet), Hannah Goodman, and Constance Whitney. In Scotland, the woman was identified as Marjorie Elphinstone (second wife of Robert Drummond of Carnock), or sometimes Margaret Halcro Erskine.\n\nA version of the story has become part of Lurgan folklore, with the woman identified as Marjorie (or Margorie) McCall.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "264441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264441", "title": "Lek mating", "text": "Lek mating\n\nA lek is an aggregation of male animals gathered to engage in competitive displays, lekking, to entice visiting females which are surveying prospective partners for copulation. Leks are commonly formed before or during the breeding season. A lekking species is characterised by male displays, strong female mate choice, and the conferring of indirect benefits to males. Although most prevalent among birds such as black grouse, lekking is also found in insects including paper wasps, crustaceans, fishes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals.\n\nA classical lek consists of male territories in visual and auditory range of each other. An exploded lek, as seen in the kakapo (the owl parrot), has more widely separated territories, but still in auditory range.\n\nLekking is associated with an apparent paradox: strong sexual selection by females for specific male traits ought to erode genetic diversity by Fisherian runaway, but diversity is maintained and runaway does not occur. Many attempts have been made to explain it away, but the paradox remains.\n\nThe term derives from the Swedish \"lek\", a noun which typically denotes pleasurable and less rule-bound games and activities (\"play\", as by children). English use of \"lek\" dates to the 1860s. Llewelyn Lloyd's \"The Game birds and wild fowl of Sweden and Norway\" (1867) introduces it (capitalised and in single quotes, as 'Lek') explicitly as a Swedish term.\n\nThe term was originally used most commonly for black grouse (Swedish: \"orrlek\") and for capercaillie (Swedish: \"tjäderlek\"), and lekking behavior is quite common in birds of this type, such as sage grouse, prairie chicken, great bustard and sharp-tailed grouse. However, lekking is also found in birds of other families, such as the ruff, great snipe, Guianan cock-of-the-rock, musk ducks, hermit hummingbirds, manakins, birds-of-paradise, screaming pihas and the kakapo. Lekking is seen in some mammals such as fallow deer, Ugandan kob (a waterbuck), some pinnipeds, some bats, and the topi antelope. Lekking is found in amphibians such as moor frogs and bullfrogs, reptiles such as marine iguanas and some species of fish (e.g., Atlantic cod, desert pupfish, and the cichlid \"Astatotilapia burtoni\"). Even insects like the midge, ghost moth, and lesser wax moth demonstrate lekking behavior. Lekking is also found in some paper wasp species such as \"Polistes dominula\", the orchid bee \"Eulaema meriana,\" in some butterfly species like the black swallowtail (\"Papilio polyxenes\"), and in tarantula hawks like \"Hemipepsis ustulata\".\n\nThere are two types of lekking arrangements: classical and exploded. In the classic lekking system, male territories are in visual and auditory range of their neighbours. In an exploded lek, males are further away from one another than they would be in a classic lek. Males in an exploded lek are outside of visual range of one another, but they stay within earshot. Exploded lek territories are much more expansive than classic systems and are known to exhibit more variation. A well-known example of exploded leks is the \"booming\" call of the kakapo, the males of which position themselves many kilometres apart from one another to signal to potential mates.\n\nLek territories of different taxa are stable and do not vary in terms of size and location. Males often return to the same mating sites because of female fidelity. It has been shown that avian females such as the black grouse and great snipe are faithful to males and not mating sites. Successful males congregate in the same area as the previous breeding season because it is familiar to them, while females return to reunite with said males. Females do not return to a mating site if their male partner is not present. Another possible explanation for lek stability is from male hierarchies within a lek. In some species of manakins, subordinate betas may inherit an alpha's display site, increasing the chances of female visitation. Rank may also contribute to the stability of lek size, as lower ranking males may congregate to achieve a perceived optimal size as a way to attract females.\n\nSome species of ants, such as red harvester ants, as well as certain bee species, like \"Tetragonisca angustula\" and \"Trigona spinipes\" exhibit lek-like mating patterns. Males form reproductive aggregations, congregating and collectively give off a pheromone that attracts reproductive females. The more males present to give off the pheromone, the stronger the attraction for the females.\n\nLek mating is relatively common among paper wasp species. For example, \"Polistes dominula\" males often fight with other males in mid-air to demonstrate their superiority and attractiveness. Males that lose fly away from the lek. Females fly through leks or perch near lekking areas to observe males before making choices on mates and they use the highly conspicuous abdominal spots on males, which are highly variable in size and shape, to aid in mate choice. Males with smaller, more elliptically shaped spots are more dominant over other males and preferred by females compared to males who have larger, more irregularly shaped spots. In comparison, \"Mischocyttarus flavitarsis\" males choose a perch site near female hibernation areas, rub their abdomens to mark their territory and wait 6–7 weeks for a female to approach. If an intruder approaches, the owner of the site lunges and grapples the other wasp. Typically, they fall off the perch site and finish the fight on the ground.\n\nThe main benefit for both sexes is mating success. For males, the costs stem from females’ preferences. The traits that are selected for may be energetically costly to maintain and may cause increased predation. For example, increased vocalization rate caused a decrease in the mass of male great snipe. Another cost would be male competition, as females prefer victorious males. Great snipes, \"Gallinago media\", regularly fight to display dominance or defend their territory. Aggressive male black grouse are preferred over non-aggressive males and when the males fight they tear feathers from each other's tails. At first glance, it would seem that females receive no direct benefits because these males are only contributing genes to the offspring. However, lekking actually reduces the cost of female searching because the congregating of males makes mate selection easier. Females do not have to travel as far, since they are able to evaluate and compare multiple males within the same vicinity. This may also help reduce the amount of time a female may be vulnerable to predators. Female marbled reed frogs, \"Hyperolius marmoratus\", under predatory pressure consistently chose leks near their release sites, and high male calling rates reduced female search time.\n\nA meta analysis of 27 species found that qualities such as lekking size, male display rate, and the rate of male aggression exhibit positive correlation with male success rates. A positive correlation was also found between attendance, magnitude of exaggerated traits, age, frequency of fights, and mating success. This female preference leads to mating skew, with some males being more successful at copulating with females. The variation in mating success is quite large in lek mating systems with 70-80 percent of matings being attributed to only 10%-20% of the males present.\n\nSince sexual selection by females for specific male trait values should erode genetic diversity, the maintenance of genetic variation in lekking species constitutes a paradox in evolutionary biology. Many attempts have been made to explain it away, but the paradox remains. There are two conditions in which the lek paradox arises. The first is that males contribute only genes and the second is that female preference does not affect fecundity. Female choice should lead to directional runaway selection, resulting in a greater prevalence for the selected traits. Stronger selection should lead to impaired survival, as it decreases genetic variance and ensures that more offspring have similar traits. However, lekking species do not exhibit runaway selection. In a lekking reproductive system, what male sexual characteristics can signal to females is limited, as the males provide no resources to females or parental care to their offspring. This implies that females gain indirect benefits from her choice in the form of \"good genes\" for her offspring. Amotz Zahavi argued that male sexual characteristics only convey useful information to the females if these traits confer a handicap on the male. The handicap principle may be a resolution to the lek paradox, for if females select for the condition of male ornaments, then their offspring have better fitness. One potential resolution to the lek paradox is Rowe and Houle's theory that sexually selected traits depend on physical condition, which might in turn, summarize many genetic loci. This is the genic capture hypothesis, which describes how a significant amount of the genome is involved in shaping the traits that are sexually selected. There are two assumptions in the genic capture hypothesis: the first is that sexually selected traits are dependent upon condition and the second is that general condition is attributable to high genetic variance. In addition, W. D. Hamilton and M. Zuk proposed that sexually selected traits might signal resistance to parasites. One resolution to the lek paradox involves female preferences and how preference alone does not cause a drastic enough directional selection to diminish the genetic variance in fitness. Another conclusion is that the preferred trait is not naturally selected for or against and the trait is maintained because it implies increased attractiveness to the male. \n\nThere have been several hypotheses proposed as to why males cluster into leks. The hotshot hypothesis is the only model that attributes males as the driving force behind aggregation. The hotshot model hypothesizes that attractive males, known as hotshots, garner both female and male attention. Females go to the hotshots because they are attracted to these males. Other males form leks around these hotshots as a way to lure females away from the hotshot. A manipulative experiment using the little bustard, \"Tetrax tetrax\", was done to test the various lek evolution models. The experiment involved varying the size and sex ratio of leks using decoys. To test whether or not the presence of a hotshot determined lek formation, a hotshot little bustard decoy was placed within a lek. After the fake hotshot was added to the lek, both male and female visitation to the lek increased.\n\nThe hotspot model considers the female density to be the catalyst for the clustering of males. This model predicts that leks will form where females tend to reside as a way to increase female interaction. Female manakin traffic has been observed to be concentrated around leks, bathing sites, and fruiting areas, with males aggregated near the most visited fruiting resources. The hotspot model also predicts that lek size is dependent upon the number of females inhabiting a patch of land. To test if the number of females affects lek formation, a group of female little bustard decoys were added to a lek. The presence of these female decoys did not have an effect on lek size.\n\nThe blackhole model proposes that females have a preference for neither size nor type of male, but rather that females tend to be mobile and mate wherever leks may be located. This model predicts that female mobility is a response to male harassment. This prediction is difficult to test, but there was a negative correlation found between male aggressiveness and female visitation in the little bustard population. Evidence supporting the black hole model is mainly found in ungulates.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis for lekking is kin selection, which assumes that males within a lek are related to one another. As females rarely mate outside of leks, it is advantageous for males to form leks. Although not all males within a lek mate with a female, the unmated males still receive fitness benefits. Kin selection explains that related males congregate to form leks, as a way to attract females and increase inclusive fitness. In some species, the males at the leks show a high degree of relatedness, but this does not apply as a rule to lek-forming species in general. In a few species such as peacocks and black grouse, leks are composed of brothers and half-brothers. The lower-ranking males gain some fitness benefit by passing their genes on through attracting mates for their brothers (larger leks attract more females). Peacocks recognize and will lek with their brothers, even if they have never met before.\n\nAnother hypothesis is predator protection, or the idea that there is a reduction in individual predation risk in a larger group. This could work both for the males in within the group as well as any female who visits the lek. Protection also explains the presence of mixed leks, when a male of one species joins a lek of another species for protection from a common set of predators. This occurs with manakins, as well as other birds such as grouse species.\n"}

{"id": "239148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=239148", "title": "Lucius Appuleius Saturninus", "text": "Lucius Appuleius Saturninus\n\nLucius Appuleius Saturninus (died late 100 BC) was a Roman populist and tribune. He is most notable for introducing a series of legislative reforms, alongside his associate Gaius Servilius Glaucia and with the consent of the famous Gaius Marius, during the last years of the second century BC. Senatorial opposition to these laws eventually led to an internal crisis, the declaration of the \"senatus consultum ultimum\", and the deaths of Saturninus, Glaucia, and their followers in 100 BC.\n\nAs \"quaestor\" (104 BC) he superintended the imports of grain at Ostia, but was removed by the Roman Senate (an unusual proceeding), and replaced by Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, one of the chief members of the \"Optimates\". He does not appear to have been charged with incapacity or mismanagement, and the standard view is that the injustice of his dismissal drove him into the arms of the \"Populares\".\n\nIn 103 BC he was elected tribune. He entered into an agreement with Gaius Marius, and in order to gain the favour of his soldiers proposed that each of his veterans should receive an allotment of 100 iugera of land in the Roman province of Africa. He was also chiefly instrumental in securing the election of Marius to his fourth consulship (102 BC).\n\nAn opportunity to retaliate against the \"Nobiles\" was afforded him by the arrival (101 BC) of ambassadors from Mithridates VI of Pontus, with large sums of money for bribing the Senate; compromising revelations were made by Saturninus, who insulted the ambassadors. He was brought to trial for violating the law of nations, and only escaped conviction by an \"ad misericordiam\" appeal to the people. To the first tribunate of Saturninus is probably to be assigned his law on \"majestas\", the exact provisions of which are unknown, but its object was probably to strengthen the power of the tribunes and the \"Populares\"; it dealt with the \"minuta majestas\" (diminished authority) of the Roman people, that is, with all acts tending to impair the integrity of the Commonwealth, being thus more comprehensive than the modern word \"treason\".\n\nOne of the chief objects of Saturninus's hatred was Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus, who, when censor, endeavoured to remove Saturninus from the Senate on the ground of immorality, but his colleague refused to assent. In order to ingratiate himself with the people, who still cherished the memory of the Gracchi, Saturninus took about with him Lucius Equitius, a paid freedman, who made himself out to be the son of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. Sempronia, sister of the dead Gracchi, refused to acknowledge her alleged nephew.\n\nMarius, on his return to Rome after his victory over the Cimbri, finding himself isolated in the senate, entered into a compact with Saturninus and his ally Gaius Servilius Glaucia, and the three formed a kind of triumvirate, supported by the veterans of Marius and many of the common people. By the aid of bribery and assassination Marius was elected (100 BC) consul for the sixth time, Glaucia \"praetor\", and Saturninus tribune for the second time. Saturninus now brought forward an agrarian law, the lex Appuleia agraria, an extension of the African law already alluded to. It was proposed that all the land north of the Padus (Po) lately in possession of the Cimbri, including that of the independent Celtic tribes which had been temporarily occupied by them, should be held available for distribution among the veterans of Marius. This was problematic, since the land was already the property of the provincials who had been dispossessed by the Cimbri.\n\nColonies were to be founded in Sicilia, Achaea, Transalpine Gaul, and Macedonia, which were to be purchased with the Gold of Tolosa, the temple treasures embezzled by Quintus Servilius Caepio (consul in 106). Further, though they were classed as Roman, Italians were to be admitted to these colonies, and as they were to be burgess colonies, the right of the Italians to equality with the Romans was thereby partially recognized. The city mob therefore strongly opposed the bill, resenting sharing their citizen rights with the Italian allies, and Saturninus was obliged to call up rural voters from outside the city to pass the bill.\n\nA clause provided that, within 5 days after the passing of the law, every senator should take an oath to observe it, under penalty of being expelled from the senate and heavily fined. All the senators subsequently took the oath except Metellus Numidicus, who went into exile. Saturninus also brought in a bill, the object of which was to gain the support of the people by supplying grain at a nominal price. The bill either reduced the already cheap price fixed by the corn-law of Caius Gracchus, or was a repeal of a former Senatorial repeal of Gracchus' law, though the former is more likely. The quaestor Quintus Servilius Caepio the Younger declared that the treasury could not stand the strain, and Saturninus' own colleagues interposed their veto. Saturninus ordered the voting to continue, and Caepio dispersed the meeting by violence. The Senate declared the proceedings null and void, because thunder had been heard; Saturninus replied that the Senate had better remain quiet; otherwise the thunder might be followed by hail. The bills (\"leges Appuleiae\") were finally passed by the aid of the Marian veterans.\n\nMarius, finding himself overshadowed by his colleagues and compromised by their excesses, thought seriously of breaking with them, and Saturninus and Glaucia saw that their only hope of safety lay in their retention of office. At the elections for 99, held probably in late summer–autumn 100, Saturninus was elected tribune for the third time for the year beginning December 10 100, and Glaucia, although at the time praetor and therefore not eligible until after the lapse of 2 years, was a candidate for the consulship. Marcus Antonius Orator was elected without opposition; the other \"Optimate\" candidate, Gaius Memmius, who seemed to have the better chance of success, was beaten to death by the hired agents of Saturninus and Glaucia, while the voting was actually going on.\n\nThis produced a complete revulsion of public feeling. The Senate met on the following day, declared Saturninus and Glaucia public enemies, and issued the so-called 'final decree' (\"senatus consultum ultimum\") calling upon Marius to defend the State. Marius had no alternative but to obey. Saturninus, defeated in a pitched battle in the Roman Forum, took refuge with his followers in the Capitol, where, the water supply having been cut off, they were forced to capitulate. Marius, having assured them that their lives would be spared, removed them to the Curia Hostilia, intending to proceed against them according to law. But the more impetuous members of the aristocratic party climbed onto the roof, stripped off the tiles, and stoned Saturninus and many others to death. Glaucia, who had escaped into a house, was dragged out and killed.\n\nHis daughter Appuleia married well despite the family disgrace, and was mother of two consuls, including the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Another descendant, Sextus Appuleius, was consul in 29 BC. His son Sextus Appuleius, consul in AD 14, had a son by Fabia Numantina, who died young; Fabia had inscribed on his gravestone that the boy was \"the last of his family\". A Marcus Appuleius who was consul in 20 BC may have been another descendant.\n"}

Although the story was thought by many to be a hoax, the bird's owner took him to the University of Utah in Salt Lake City to establish the facts.\n\nOn September 10, 1945, farmer Lloyd Olsen of Fruita, Colorado, was planning to eat supper with his mother-in-law and was sent out to the yard by his wife to bring back a chicken. Olsen chose a five-and-a-half-month-old Wyandotte chicken named Mike. The axe removed the bulk of the head, but missed the jugular vein, leaving one ear and most of the brain stem intact.\n\nDue to Olsen's failed attempt to behead Mike, the chicken was still able to balance on a perch and walk clumsily. He attempted to preen, peck for food, and crow, though with limited success; his \"crowing\" consisted of a gurgling sound made in his throat. When Mike did not die, Olsen instead decided to care for the bird. He fed it a mixture of milk and water via an eyedropper, and gave it small grains of corn and worms.\n\nOnce his fame had been established, Mike began a career of touring sideshows in the company of such other creatures as a two-headed baby. He was also photographed for dozens of magazines and papers, and was featured in \"Time\" and \"Life\" magazines. Mike was put on display to the public for an admission cost of 25 cents. At the height of his popularity, the chicken's owner earned US$4,500 per month ($ today); Mike was valued at $10,000.\n\nIn March 1947, at a motel in Phoenix on a stopover while traveling back from tour, Mike started choking in the middle of the night. He had managed to get a kernel of corn in his throat. The Olsens had inadvertently left their feeding and cleaning syringes at the sideshow the day before, and so were unable to save Mike. Olsen claimed that he had sold the bird off, resulting in stories of Mike still touring the country as late as 1949. Other sources say that the chicken's severed trachea could not properly take in enough air to be able to breathe, and it therefore choked to death in the motel.\n\nIt was determined that the axe had missed the jugular vein and a clot had prevented Mike from bleeding to death. Although most of his head was severed, most of his brain stem and one ear were left on his body. Since basic functions (breathing, heart rate, etc.) as well as most of a chicken's reflex actions are controlled by the brain stem, Mike was able to remain quite healthy. This is a good example of central motor generators enabling basic homeostatic functions to be carried out in the absence of higher brain centres.\n\nMike the Headless Chicken is now an institution in Fruita, Colorado, with an annual \"Mike the Headless Chicken Day\", the third weekend of May, starting in 1999. Events held include the \"5K Run Like a Headless Chicken Race\", egg toss, \"Pin the Head on the Chicken\", the \"Chicken Cluck-Off\", and \"Chicken Bingo\", in which chicken droppings on a numbered grid choose the numbers.\n\nMike the Headless Chicken was an inspiration for the poultry-themed comedy punk band The Radioactive Chicken Heads, serving as the subject of their 2008 song \"Headless Mike\", for which a music video was filmed. The band also features a Headless Mike puppet which is frequently used in their live shows.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37889456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37889456", "title": "Murder of Yvonne Gilford", "text": "Murder of Yvonne Gilford\n\nYvonne Gilford was an Australian nurse who was murdered in the King Fahd Military Medical Complex, in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia on 12 December 1996. Two British nurses, Deborah Parry and Lucille \"Lucy\" McLauchlan, were arrested for the crime. Parry confessed the murder and McLauchlan to being an accessory, though both subsequently claimed to have been coerced into signing the confession. Parry was sentenced to death by beheading, and McLauchlan to eight years' imprisonment and 500 lashes. Parry's sentence was reduced to life imprisonment after Gilford's elder brother Frank accepted a \"blood money\" payment of approximately £750,000, and both sentences were eventually commuted to time served after personal intervention from King Fahd.\n\nYvonne Gilford was born in 1941 and grew up on a farm in Jamestown, South Australia, along with her parents and brother Frank. She became a nurse at the age of 28 and initially worked in Auckland, New Zealand, before moving to London in 1973 and then Johannesburg, South Africa in 1976. After working in various hospitals in the city for the next twenty years, she accepted a new job in Dhahran in April 1996, and moved to Saudi Arabia with her ultimate aim being to earn enough money to retire from nursing and return to Australia. She initially found herself with few colleagues who spoke English, and quickly befriended Parry and McLauchlan after they arrived in Dhahran in August of that year. For Parry it was her second time working in the country, having previously worked there between 1993 and 1994, while it was McLauchlan's first time working abroad, having been dismissed from her previous job for credit card fraud. It subsequently emerged she had used fraudulent references to obtain the job in Dhahran.\n\nGilford was last seen alive on the evening of 11 December, when she, Parry and McLauchlan held an \"early Christmas party\" in her bedroom. She failed to report for work the following morning, and when guards were sent to her bedroom to investigate, they found her dead. There were signs of a struggle in which Gilford had been stabbed thirteen times, though the ultimate cause of her death was ascertained to have been asphyxiation by her own bed pillow. Within the next week, Parry and McLauchlan were arrested on suspicion of murder after allegedly using Gilford's bank card to make a series of withdrawals totalling approximately $1,000.\n\nSeveral days after their arrest, Parry eventually confessed to having been in a relationship with Gilford, and that she had attacked her (albeit without intent to kill) following an argument. McLauchlan agreed that her account of events was true, though by the time of the trial both had unsuccessfully attempted to withdraw the confession, claiming that they had been intimidated, deprived of sleep and subjected to threats of sexual violence in order to coerce them into signing it. Prior to the trial, the lawyers for the two nurses discovered similarities between Gilford's death and the 1994 murder of Liberty de Guzman, another nurse at the same complex, but that case was judged to not be relevant to the trial.\n\nThe actual trial was relatively swift, in large part due to the confession that the two nurses had signed. There was no cross-examination of the two witnesses, nor any witnesses or forensic evidence. McLauchlan was found guilty of manslaughter and was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment and 500 lashes. Parry's sentencing was more complicated, as she was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, but could be commuted to a life sentence if the closest surviving relative of the victim were to accept a \"blood money\" payment as allowed under the Islamic law of \"Diyya\". Gilford's closest surviving relative was her brother Frank, who initially refused the notion of accepting any such payment, though eventually accepted a payment worth around £750,000, which was funded primarily by British Aerospace and philanthropist/publisher Felix Dennis. Frank subsequently donated the entire payment to a children's charity.\n\nWhile Parry had been saved from the death penalty, there were still many questions about the overall fairness of the trial, and in March 1998, Prime Minister Tony Blair personally appealed to King Fahd during a state visit to resolve the situation. Finally, on 20 May 1998, Fahd commuted the sentences of both women to 17 months in prison - the time that they had already served - with the only conditions being that both were to write him a letter personally thanking him for his clemency, and then accept deportation back to the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing her return to the UK, McLauchlan married her fiancé Grant Ferrie. She subsequently asked to meet Frank to personally apologise for calling him a \"greedy, selfish bastard\" for accepting the blood money, but Frank refused the offer and said that he did not ever want to meet either of the two nurses. She was subsequently struck off the nursing register for her actions in using false references to obtain her job in Saudi Arabia. In 2011 she was convicted of credit card fraud for a second time, before being convicted of theft in May 2012. On both occasions, her solicitor said she had been \"mentally scarred\" by her experience in the Saudi prison. McLauchlan died on 7 January 2014, aged 48, at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, Scotland after suffering a brain haemorrhage at her house two days previously.\n\nParry resumed her nursing career upon her return to the UK, being re-employed at one of her former jobs at Holy Cross Hospital in Haslemere, despite an attempt by MP George Galloway to have her struck off. She continued to maintain that she was not a lesbian and had not been in a relationship with Yvonne Gilford and had no involvement whatsoever with the murder, and in 2012 called for Gilford's body to be exhumed and subjected to forensic techniques that were not available at the time of her death.\n\nThe case attracted much attention in the UK and Australia owing to the fact it would have been the first execution of a western woman by Saudi Arabia. Other factors were the British media's reporting over the case and the political pressures that prompted Fahd to release the nurses. The case was mentioned in \"Desert Royal,\" a memoir of a Saudi princess written by Jean Sasson.\n"}

He travelled to Portuguese Timor (now known as Timor-Leste) in October 1975, following the story of the Balibo Five, who had been killed by Indonesian soldiers just weeks before. East was captured by the Indonesian security forces and was brought, along with many other prisoners, to the Dili waterfront where he and scores of others were then executed by firing squad.\n\nPreviously, he had worked as a publicity officer for the Australian Country Party in Queensland and had been working in Darwin as a press officer for the Darwin Reconstruction Commission (which was created after the devastation of Darwin by Cyclone Tracy in December 1974).\n\nBorn in , in western Sydney in 1922, East was raised near Dubbo in country New South Wales. He had two brothers, Bill and Alan, and a younger sister, Glenise. East was a child of the Depression and his teenage years in the 1930s were difficult ones. During World War II, East served in the Royal Australian Navy.\n\nAfter the war, East entered journalism. Working at first in regional New South Wales newspapers, in the 1950s he left Australia to cover foreign events in places as varied as Cyprus, Africa, China and the Suez Crisis. In the 1960s, he went to work for Visnews (today Reuters Television). In the early 1970s he worked as a press officer for different organisations including both the Australian Country Party and the Australian Labor Party.\n\nAt the time of East's arrival, East Timor was under the \"de facto\" government of Fretilin, a left-wing political party. The Portuguese governor had fled to the island of Atauro and was refusing to return to the capital, Dili. Fretilin issued a Unilateral declaration of independence from Portugal on 28 November 1975.\n\nEast was one of only three journalists in Timor — the other two were Michael Richardson, the South-East Asia correspondent for \"The Age\" and Jill Jolliffe, a freelancer who was then working for Reuters. When it became obvious that a full-scale invasion by Indonesia was imminent, Richardson and Jolliffe left with the Red Cross and went to Darwin. East, however, decided to remain in East Timor. He planned to retreat with the Fretilin forces to the mountains in the interior and report from there to the outside world. He was captured by the Indonesians before he could get away. Eyewitnesses later reported that East was brought, along with many other prisoners, to the Dili waterfront, where he and scores of others were then executed by firing squad.\n\nFollowing an inquest into the murder of the Balibo Five, there were calls for a similar inquest into the murder of East.\n\nIn Timothy Mo's novel \"The Redundancy of Courage\", the character Bill Mabbely is based upon Roger East.\n\nAnthony LaPaglia starred as East in the 2009 Australian film \"Balibo\"; which tells the story of the Balibo Five.

Collision with an iceberg was another explanation suggested at the time.\n\n\"City of Boston\" had been fitted with a two-blade propeller to replace her original three-blade propeller which had been broken during her previous voyage, and Captain Brooks of the SS \"City of Brooklyn\" expressed the opinion that the new propeller would not be strong enough to let her make headway against the adverse weather.\n\nOn 11 December 1875 the mystery of the \"City of Boston\" took a brief turn, that looked like it might give a solution, albeit a melodramatic one. On that day the German seaport of Bremerhaven was the scene of a dynamite explosion that killed eighty people. It turned out that a barrel being stored on board a ship had been a specially made dynamite bomb with a remarkable timer. It was to explode and sink the ship and kill most (if not all the passengers) out at sea (where no trace of the vessel would be likely to be found). The purpose was to collect insurance on the cargo. The premature explosion of the barrel caused the man responsible (one \"William Thompson\") to shoot himself. He became known in the period as the \"Dynamite Fiend\". In time Thompson was revealed to be one \"Alexander Keith, Jr.\" a Canadian from Halifax, Nova Scotia. In the wake of the discovery of his scheme and crime, police departments around the world were wondering if Thompson/Keith had been involved in the disappearance of other ships. \n\nThompson had been in New York City in the winter of 1870, and it was wondered if he had any hand in the disappearance of the \"City of Boston\". At the time he had sent two large money transfers to his wife from New York, and that looked like a possible pay-off by some partners in the scheme. As he came from Halifax, and the \"City of Boston\" was headed for Halifax, it looked like there could be a connection, especially as part of the cargo included a shipment of furs by one \"James Thompson\" of Halifax. However, further investigation found that Mr. James Thompson was a real merchant, who lost a valuable shipment of furs on the \"City of Boston\", and (ironically) was unable to get the shipment insured. After that the possibility of a link between Thompson/Keith and the disappearance of the \"City of Boston\" diminished.\n\n\n\n"}

As an adolescent, she first performed popular music in talent contests at the local cinema (bioscope) during the intermission. By the 1950s she was singing at various nightclubs, community dances and social events, performing with notable Cape Town pianists Tony Schilder and Henry February, among others. She built her repertoire watching British and American movies and transcribing lyrics from songs heard on the radio, where she discovered Nat King Cole, Billie Holiday, Doris Day, Ella Fitzgerald. These musicians would come to influence her singing style, notably in terms of light phrasing and clear diction.\n\nAt the age of 21, she joined Arthur Klugman's travelling show, \"Coloured Jazz and Variety\", on a tour of South Africa. When the production failed, she found herself stranded in Mozambique, where she met South African saxophonist Kippie Moeketsi. In 1959, she returned to Cape Town's now thriving jazz scene, where she met pianist Dollar Brand (later known as Abdullah Ibrahim), whom she would marry in 1965. In that same year she recorded what would have been the first jazz LP in South Africa's history. Entitled \"My Songs for You\", with accompaniment by Ibrahim's trio, the recording of mostly standards was never released.\n\nIn the aftermath of South Africa's Sharpeville Massacre of 1960, Benjamin and Ibrahim left South Africa for Europe. The couple, along with Ibrahim's trio of bassist Johnny Gertze and drummer Makhaya Ntshoko, settled in Zurich, Switzerland, and worked throughout Germany and Scandinavia, meeting and occasional working with American jazz players, including Don Byas, Dexter Gordon, Kenny Drew, Ben Webster, Bud Powell, John Coltrane, and Thelonious Monk. The artist who would have the greatest impact on Benjamin's life, however, was Duke Ellington.\n\nBenjamin met Ellington while he was in Zurich in 1963. Standing in the wings during most of his band’s performance, once the concert ended she insisted that Duke hear her husband’s trio at the Club Africana, where Ibrahim's band had a standing engagement. Duke obliged, but insisted that Benjamin sing for him. Following this encounter, Ellington arranged for the couple to fly to Paris and record separate albums for Frank Sinatra’s Reprise label, for whom Ellington functioned as Artists and Repertoire representative. Ibrahim’s record, \"Duke Ellington Presents The Dollar Brand Trio\", was released the following year and subsequently helped him build a following in Europe and the United States. Benjamin’s recording, however, remained unreleased was presumed to be lost until its release in 1996 by Enja Records, under the title \"A Morning in Paris\". The session's engineer, Gerhard Lerner, had surreptitiously made a second copy.\n\nShe maintained her musical relationship with Ellington. In 1965, he arranged to have her perform with his band in the U.S. at the Newport Jazz Festival (when she sang the Ellington ballad \"Solitude\"), and at one point asked her to join his band permanently. Due to her recent marriage to Ibrahim that same year, Benjamin declined the offer.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Benjamin and Ibrahim moved back and forth between Europe and New York City, as Ibrahim worked to establish his career. Benjamin spent much of the period as a manager and agent for her husband while raising their son, Tsakwe. The year 1976 marked a turning point for Benjamin. She and Ibrahim returned to South Africa to live; she gave birth to her daughter, Tsidi (now the underground hip-hop artist Jean Grae); and recorded \"African Songbird\", an album of original compositions, for South Africa's Gallo Records. Shortly after Tsidi's birth, the family relocated to New York city in 1977, to the famed Hotel Chelsea.\n\nIn 1979, Benjamin launched her own record label, ekapa rpm, to produce, publish and distribute her and Ibrahim's music. Between 1979 and 2002, she released eight of her own albums on ekapa: \"Sathima Sings Ellington\", \"Dedications\", \"Memories and Dreams\", \"Windsong\", \"Lovelight\", \"Southern Touch\", \"Cape Town Love\", and \"Musical Echoes\".\n\nEach of these recordings received critical acclaim for Benjamin. \"Dedications\" was nominated for a Grammy in 1982. Benjamin's collaborators on these albums have included saxophonist Carlos Ward, pianists Stephen Scott, Kenny Barron, Larry Willis and Onaje Allan Gumbs, bassist Buster Williams and drummers Billy Higgins and Ben Riley. For the most part, Benjamin has used American musicians for her U.S. recordings and South African musicians when in Cape Town. Her 2002 recording, \"Musical Echoes\", featured American pianist Stephen Scott with two South Africans, bassist Basil Moses and drummer Lulu Gontsana.\n\nIn 2000, Danish second-hand bookdealer and fan of South African jazz Lars Rasmussen published a collection of essays and a discography of Benjamin's music in \"Sathima Bea Benjamin: Embracing Jazz\" (Copenhagen, 2000). It contains two compact discs of Sathima's music: \"Cape Town Love\" and an \"Embracing Jazz\" compilation with photographs.\n\nIn October 2004, South African president Thabo Mbeki gave her the Order of Ikhamanga Silver Award for \"excellent contribution as a jazz artist\" and for her contribution \"to the struggle against apartheid.\" In March 2005, the art group Pen and Brush, Inc. presented her with a Certificate of Achievement for her work as a performer, musician, composer, and \"activist in the struggle for human rights in South Africa\". Benjamin was profiled in the March 2006 issue of \"JazzTimes\".\n\nHer album \"SongSpirit\", was released on 17 October 2006 in celebration of her 70th birthday. A compilation record, it includes tracks from her earlier albums, plus a previously unreleased duet with Abdullah Ibrahim from 1973.\n\nIn 2007, Benjamin began reissuing her back catalogue for download. \"Cape Town Love\", released 19 June, began the process, while \"A Morning in Paris\" was reissued in October 2007 to mark her 71st birthday. It was released for download on 16 October, and reissued on CD on 22 January 2008.\n\nIn December 2008 she performed at the Apollo Theater at the closing of the concert Bricktop at the Apollo, hosted by film director Jordan Walker-Pearlman. She sang \"Someone to Watch Over Me\".\n\nIn 2010, she was the subject of the documentary \"Sathima's Windsong\", directed by author and professor Daniel Yon.\n\nIn 2011 Duke University Press published \"Musical Echoes: South African Women Thinking in Jazz\", which was written by Benjamin and Carol Muller, a South African ethnomusicologist, over the course of twenty years.\n\nShe returned to Cape Town in 2011, where she continued to work as a vocalist. She died on 20 August 2013 at the age of 76.\n\n"}

{"id": "28867511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28867511", "title": "Trance", "text": "Trance\n\nTrance is an abnormal state of wakefulness in which a person is not self-aware and is either altogether unresponsive to external stimuli but is nevertheless capable of pursuing and realizing an aim, or is selectively responsive in following the directions of the person who has induced the trance. Trance states may occur involuntarily and unbidden.\n\nThe term \"trance\" may be associated with hypnosis, meditation, magic, flow, and prayer. It may also be related to the earlier generic term, altered states of consciousness, which is no longer used in \"consciousness studies\" discourse.\n\nTrance in its modern meaning comes from an earlier meaning of \"a dazed, half-conscious or insensible condition or state of fear\", via the Old French \"transe\" \"fear of evil\", from the Latin \"transīre\" \"to cross\", \"pass over\". This definition is now obsolete.\n\nWier, in his 1995 book, \"Trance: from magic to technology\", defines a simple trance (p. 58) as a state of mind being caused by cognitive loops where a cognitive object (thoughts, images, sounds, intentional actions) repeats long enough to result in various sets of disabled cognitive functions. Wier represents all trances (which include sleep and watching television) as taking place on a dissociated trance plane where at least some cognitive functions such as volition are disabled; as is seen in what is typically termed a 'hypnotic trance'. With this definition, meditation, hypnosis, addictions and charisma are seen as being trance states. In Wier's 2007 book, \"The Way of Trance\", he elaborates on these forms, adds ecstasy as an additional form and discusses the ethical implications of his model, including magic and government use which he terms \"trance abuse\".\n\nJohn Horgan in \"Rational Mysticism\" (2003) explores the neurological mechanisms and psychological implications of trances and other mystical manifestations. Horgan incorporates literature and case-studies from a number of disciplines in this work: chemistry, physics, psychology, radiology and theology.\n\nThe following are some examples of trance states:\n\nTrance conditions include all the different states of mind, emotions, moods and daydreams that human beings experience. All activities which engage a human involve the filtering of information coming into sense modalities, and this influences brain functioning and consciousness. Therefore, trance may be understood as a way for the mind to change the way it filters information in order to provide more efficient use of the mind's resources.\n\nTrance states may also be accessed or induced by various modalities and is a way of accessing the unconscious mind for the purposes of relaxation, healing, intuition and inspiration. There is an extensive documented history of trance as evidenced by the case-studies of anthropologists and ethnologists and associated and derivative disciplines. Hence trance may be perceived as endemic to the human condition and a Human Universal. Principles of trance are being explored and documented as are methods of trance induction. Benefits of trance states are being explored by medical and scientific inquiry. Many traditions and rituals employ trance. Trance also has a function in religion and mystical experience.\n\nCastillo (1995) states that: \"Trance phenomena result from the behavior of intense focusing of attention, which is the key psychological mechanism of trance induction. Adaptive responses, including institutionalized forms of trance, are 'tuned' into neural networks in the brain and depend to a large extent on the characteristics of culture. Culture-specific organizations exist in the structure of individual neurons and in the organizational formation of neural networks.\"\n\nHoffman (1998: p. 9) states that: \"Trance is still conventionally defined as a state of reduced consciousness, or a somnolent state. However, the more recent anthropological definition, linking it to 'altered states of consciousness' (Charles Tart), is becoming increasingly accepted.\"\n\nHoffman (1998, p. 9) asserts that: \"...the trance state should be discussed in the plural, because there is more than one altered state of consciousness significantly different from everyday consciousness.\"\n\nAccording to Hoffman (1998: p. 10), pilgrims visited the Temple of Epidaurus, an asclepeion, in Greece for healing sleep. Seekers of healing would make pilgrimage and be received by a priest who would welcome and bless them. This temple housed an ancient religious ritual promoting dreams in the seeker that endeavored to promote healing and the solutions to problems, as did the oracles. This temple was built in honor of Asclepios, the Greek god of medicine. The Greek treatment was referred to as incubation, and focused on prayers to Asclepios for healing. The asclepion at Epidaurus is both extensive and well-preserved, and is traditionally regarded as the birthplace of Asclepius. (For a comparable modern tool see Dreamwork.)\n\nThe Oracle at Delphi was also famous for trances in the ancient Greek world; priestesses there would make predictions about the future in exchange for gold.\n\nStories of the saints in the Middle Ages, myths, parables, fairy tales, oral lore and storytelling from different cultures are themselves potentially inducers of trance. Often literary devices such as repetition are employed which is evident in many forms of trance induction. Milton Erickson used stories to induce trance as do many NLP practitioners.\n\nFrom at least the 16th century it was held that march music may induce soldiers marching in unison into trance states where according to apologists, they bond together as a unit engendered by the rigors of training, the ties of comradeship and the chain of command. This had the effect of making the soldiers become automated, an effect which was widely evident in the 16th, 17th and 18th century due to the increasing prevalence of firearms employed in warcraft. Military instruments, especially the snare drum and other drums were used to entone a monotonous ostinato at the pace of march and heartbeat. High-pitched fifes, flutes and bagpipes were used for their \"piercing\" effect to play the melody. This would assist the morale and solidarity of soldiers as they marched to battle.\n\nJoseph Jordania recently proposed a term battle trance for this mental state, when combatants do not feel fear and pain, and when they lose their individual identity and acquire a collective identity.\n\nThe Norse Berserkers induced a trance-like state before battle, called \"Berserkergang\". It is said to have given the warriors superhuman strength and made them impervious to pain during battle. This form of trance could have been induced partly due to ingestion of hallucinogenic mushrooms.\n\nAs the mystical experience of mystics generally entails direct connection, communication and communion with Deity, Godhead and/or god; trance and cognate experience are endemic. (see Yoga, Sufism, Shaman, Umbanda, Crazy Horse, etc.)\n\nAs shown by Jonathan Garb, trance techniques also played a role in Lurianic Kabbalah, the mystical life of the circle of Moshe Hayyim Luzzatto and Hasidism.\n\nMany Christian mystics are documented as having experiences that may be considered as cognate with trance, such as: Hildegard of Bingen, John of the Cross, Meister Eckhart, Saint Theresa (as seen in the Bernini sculpture) and Francis of Assisi.\n\n\nTaves (1999) charts the synonymic language of trance in the American Christian traditions: \"power\" or \"presence\" or \"indwelling\" of God, or Christ, or the Spirit, or spirits. Typical expressions include \"the indwelling of the Spirit\" (Jonathan Edwards), \"the witness of the Spirit\" (John Wesley), \"the power of God\" (early American Methodists), being \"filled with the Spirit of the Lord\" (early Adventists; see charismatic Adventism), \"communing with spirits\" (Spiritualists), \"the Christ within\" (New Thought), \"streams of holy fire and power\" (Methodist holiness), \"a religion of the Spirit and Power\" (the Emmanuel Movement), and \"the baptism of the Holy Spirit\" (early Pentecostals). (Taves, 1999: 3)\n\nTaves (1999) well-referenced book on trance charts the experience of Anglo-American Protestants and those who left the Protestant movement beginning with the transatlantic awakening in the early 18th century and ending with the rise of the psychology of religion and the birth of Pentecostalism in the early 20th century. This book focuses on a class of seemingly involuntary acts alternately explained in religious and secular terminology. These involuntary experiences include uncontrolled bodily movements (fits, bodily exercises, falling as dead, catalepsy, convulsions); spontaneous vocalizations (crying out, shouting, speaking in tongues); unusual sensory experiences (trances, visions, voices, clairvoyance, out-of-body experiences); and alterations of consciousness and/or memory (dreams, somnium, somnambulism, mesmeric trance, mediumistic trance, hypnosis, possession, alternating personality) (Taves, 1999: 3).\n\nTrance-like states are often interpreted as religious ecstasy or visions and can be deliberately induced using a variety of techniques, including prayer, religious rituals, meditation, pranayama (breathwork or breathing exercises), physical exercise, coitus (and/or sex), music, dancing, sweating (e.g. sweat lodge), fasting, thirsting, and the consumption of psychotropic drugs such as cannabis. Sensory modality is the channel or conduit for the induction of the trance. Sometimes an ecstatic experience takes place in occasion of contact with something or somebody perceived as extremely beautiful or holy. It may also happen without any known reason. The particular technique that an individual uses to induce ecstasy is usually one that is associated with that individual's particular religious and cultural traditions. As a result, an ecstatic experience is usually interpreted within the context of a particular individual's religious and cultural traditions. These interpretations often include statements about contact with supernatural or spiritual beings, about receiving new information as a revelation, also religion-related explanations of subsequent change of values, attitudes and behavior (e.g. in case of religious conversion).\n\nBenevolent, neutral and malevolent trances may be induced (intentionally, spontaneously and/or accidentally) by different methods:\n\nCharles Tart provides a useful working definition of auditory driving. It is the induction of trance through the sense of hearing. Auditory driving works through a process known as entrainment.\n\nThe usage of repetitive rhythms to induce trance states is an ancient phenomenon. Throughout the world, shamanistic practitioners have been employing this method for millennia. Anthropologists and other researchers have documented the similarity of shamanistic auditory driving rituals among different cultures.\n\nSaid simply, entrainment is the synchronization of different rhythmic cycles. Breathing and heart rate have been shown to be affected by auditory stimulus, along with brainwave activity. The ability of rhythmic sound to affect human brainwave activity, especially theta brainwaves, is the essence of auditory driving, and is the cause of the altered states of consciousness that it can induce.\n\nNowack and Feltman have recently published an article entitled \"Eliciting the Photic Driving Response\" which states that the EEG photic driving response is a sensitive neurophysiological measure which has been employed to assess chemical and drug effects, forms of epilepsy, neurological status of Alzheimer's patients, and physiological arousal. Photic driving also impacts upon the psychological climate of a person by producing increased visual imagery and decreased physiological and subjective arousal. In this research by Nowack and Feltman, all participants reported increased visual imagery during photic driving, as measured by their responses to an imagery questionnaire.\n\nDennis Wier (https://web.archive.org/web/20060915232957/http://www.trance.edu/papers/theory.htm Accessed: 6 December 2006) states that over two millennia ago Ptolemy and Apuleius found that differing rates of flickering lights affected states of awareness and sometimes induced epilepsy. Wier also asserts that it was discovered in the late 1920s that when light was shined on closed eyelids it resulted in an echoing production of brainwave frequencies. Wier also opined that in 1965 Grey employed a stroboscope to project rhythmic light flashes into the eyes at a rate of 10–25 Hz (cycles per second). Grey discovered that this stimulated similar brainwave activity.\n\nResearch by Thomas Budzynski, Oestrander et al., in the use of brain machines suggest that photic driving via the suprachiasmatic nucleus and direct electrical stimulation and driving via other mechanisms and modalities, may entrain processes of the brain facilitating rapid and enhanced learning, produce deep relaxation, euphoria, an increase in creativity, problem solving propensity and may be associated with enhanced concentration and accelerated learning. The theta range and the border area between alpha and theta has generated considerable research interest.\n\nCharles Tart provides a useful working definition of kinesthetic driving. It is the induction of trance through the sense of touch, feeling or emotions. Kinesthetic driving works through a process known as entrainment.\n\nThe rituals practiced by some athletes in preparing for contests are dismissed as superstition, but this is a device of sport psychologists to help them to attain an ecstasy-like state. Joseph Campbell had a peak experience whilst running. Roger Bannister on breaking the four-minute mile (Cameron, 1993: 185): \"No longer conscious of my movement, I discovered a new unity with nature. I had found a new source of power and beauty, a source I never dreamt existed.\" Roger Bannister later became a distinguished neurologist.\n\nMechanisms and disciplines that include kinesthetic driving may include: dancing, walking meditation, yoga and asana, mudra, juggling, poi (juggling), etc.\n\nSufism (the mystical branch of Islam) has theoretical and metaphoric texts regarding ecstasy as a state of connection with Allah. Sufi practice rituals (\"dhikr\", \"sema\") use body movement and music to achieve the state.\n\n\nDivination is a cultural universal which anthropologists have observed as being present in many religions and cultures in all ages up to the present day (see sibyl). Divination may be defined as a mechanism for fortune-telling by ascertaining information by interpretation of omens or an alleged supernatural agency. Divination often entails ritual, and is often facilitated by trance.\n\nIn Tibet, oracles have played, and continue to play, an important part in religion and government. The word \"oracle\" is used by Tibetans to refer to the spirit, deity or entity that enters those men and women who act as media between the natural and the spiritual realms. The media are, therefore, known as \"kuten\", which literally means, \"the physical basis\".\n\nThe Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in northern India, still consults an oracle known as the \"Nechung Oracle\", which is considered the official state oracle of the government of Tibet. He gives a complete description of the process of trance and possession in his book \"Freedom in Exile\".\n\nConvergent disciplines of neuroanthropology, ethnomusicology, electroencephalography (EEG), neurotheology and cognitive neuroscience, amongst others, are conducting research into the trance induction of altered states of consciousness resulting from neuron entrainment with the driving of sensory modalities, for example polyharmonics, multiphonics, and percussive polyrhythms through the channel of the auditory and kinesthetic modality.\n\nNeuroanthropology and cognitive neuroscience are conducting research into the trance induction of altered states of consciousness (possibly engendering higher consciousness) resulting from neuron firing entrainment with these polyharmonics and multiphonics. Related research has been conducted into neural entraining with percussive polyrhythms. The timbre of traditional singing bowls and their polyrhythms and multiphonics are considered meditative and calming, and the harmony inducing effects of this tool to potentially alter consciousness are being explored by scientists, medical professionals and therapists.\n\nScientific advancement and new technologies such as computerized EEG, positron emission tomography, regional cerebral blood flow, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, are providing measurable tools to assist in understanding trance phenomena.\n\nThough a source of contention, there appear to be three current streams of inquiry: neurophysiology, social psychology and cognitive behaviorism. The neurophysiological approach is awaiting the development of a mechanism to map physiological measurements to human thought. The social-psychological approach currently measures gross subjective and social effects of thoughts and some critique it for lack of precision. Cognitive behaviorialists employ systems theory concepts and analytical techniques.\n\nThere are four principal brainwave states that range from high-amplitude, low-frequency delta to low-amplitude, high-frequency beta. These states range from deep dreamless sleep to a state of high arousal. These four brainwave states are common throughout humans. All levels of brainwaves exist in everyone at all times, even though one is foregrounded depending on the activity level. When a person is in an aroused state and exhibiting a beta brainwave pattern, their brain also exhibits a component of alpha, theta and delta, even though only a trace may be present.\n\nThe University of Philadelphia study on some Christians at the Freedom Valley Worship Center in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, revealed that glossolalia-speaking (vocalizing or praying in unrecognizable form of language which is seen in members of certain Christian sects) activates areas of the brain out of voluntary control. In addition, the frontal lobe of the brain, which monitors speech, significantly diminished in activity as the study participants spoke glossolalia. Dr. Andrew B. Newberg, in analysis of his earlier studies as opposed to the MRI scans of the test subjects, stated that Buddhist monks in meditation and Franciscan nuns in prayer exhibited increased activity in the frontal lobe, and subsequently their behaviors, very much under voluntary control. The investigation found this particular beyond-body-control characteristic only in tongue-speakers (also see xenoglossia).\n\n"}

It generalizes the linear case of predator–prey interaction firstly described by Volterra and Lotka in the Lotka–Volterra equation. A trophic function represents the consumption of prey assuming a given number of predators. The trophic function (also referred to as the functional response) was widely applied in chemical kinetics, biophysics, mathematical physics and economics. In economics, \"predator\" and \"prey\" become various economic parameters such as prices and outputs of goods in various linked sectors such as processing and supply. These relationships, in turn, were found to behave similarly to the magnitudes in chemical kinetics, where the molecular analogues of predators and prey react chemically with each other.\n\nThese inter-disciplinary findings suggest the universal character of trophic functions and the predator–prey models in which they appear. They give general principles for the dynamic interactions of objects of different natures, so that the mathematical models worked out in one science may be applied to another. Trophic functions have proven useful in forecasting temporarily stable conditions (limit cycles and/or attractors) of the coupled dynamics of predator and prey. The Pontryagin L.S. theorem on the inflection points of trophic functions guarantees the existence of a limit cycle in these systems.\n\nTrophic functions are especially important in situations of chaos, when one has numerous interacting magnitudes and objects, as is particularly true in global economics. To define and forecast the dynamics in this case is scarcely possible with linear methods, but non-linear dynamic analysis involving trophic functions leads to the discovery of limit cycles or attractors. Since in nature there exist only temporarily stable objects, such limit cycles and attractors must exist in the dynamics of observed natural objects (chemistry, flora and fauna, economics, cosmology). The general theory suggests as-yet-unknown regularities in the dynamics of the various systems surrounding us.\n\nDespite the success already achieved in research on trophic functions, the field still has great further theoretical potential and practical importance. Global economics, for instance, needs tools to forecast the dynamics of outputs and prices over a scale of at least 3–5 years so as to maintain stable demand and not over-produce, and to prevent crises such as that of 2008.\n\n"}

Although unmanned, Zond 5 carried the first Earthlings to reach the Moon, including two tortoises, mealworms, wine flies, plants, and other lifeforms, and was also the first to return Moon travelers safely to Earth.\n\nZond 5, a version of the Soyuz 7K-L1 manned Moon-flyby spacecraft, was launched by a Proton-K carrier rocket with a Blok D upper stage to conduct scientific studies during its lunar flyby.\n\nAfter Zond 4's partial success in March 1968, a follow-up was launched on April 22. The launch failed however when the LES sent an erroneous abort command at T+260 seconds and shut down the Proton booster's second stage. The escape rocket fired and pulled the descent module to safety. In July, another 7K-L1 was being prepared for launch when the Block D stage exploded on the pad, killing three people, but leaving the Proton booster and spacecraft with only minor damage.\n\nZond 5 launched on September 14 and became the first spacecraft to circle the Moon and return to land on Earth. On September 18, the spacecraft flew around the Moon. The closest distance was 1,950 km. High-quality photographs of the Earth were taken at a distance of 90,000 km. A biological payload of two Russian tortoises, wine flies, mealworms, plants, seeds, bacteria, and other living matter was included in the flight.\n\nOn September 21, the reentry capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere but could not perform a skip reentry due to a failure of the guidance system. Landing was supposed to occur in Kazakhstan, but instead Zond 5 splashed down in the Indian Ocean and was successfully recovered by the USSR recovery vessels \"Borovichy\" and \"Vasiliy Golovin\".\n\nAlthough the ballistic reentry would have been bad for human occupants, it did not appear to affect the biological specimens, all of which were alive and well when the descent module was finally opened four days after landing. It was announced that the tortoises had lost about 10 percent of their body weight but remained active and showed no loss of appetite. This spacecraft was planned as a precursor to a manned lunar spacecraft. \n\nThe USS \"McMorris\" was shadowing the Soviet recovery ships, collecting intelligence information. Photographs taken by the \"McMorris\" of the descent module bobbing in the ocean aroused concern at NASA that the Soviets were planning a manned circumlunar flight soon, especially since the United States had been tracking Zond 5 for its entire flight, and was a catalyst for the decision to launch Apollo 8 to the Moon in December instead of its originally planned mission of testing the lunar module in high Earth orbit.\n\nThe Zond 5 return capsule is on display at the RKK Energiya museum, in Russia.\n\n\n\n\"This article was originally based on material from NASA (NSSDC) information on Zond 5\"\n"}
