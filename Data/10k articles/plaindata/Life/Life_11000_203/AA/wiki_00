Writers Neil Marr and Tim Field wrote about it in their 2001 book \"Bullycide: Death at Playtime\". \n\nLegal analysts criticise the term bullycide because it links a cause with an effect under someone else's control. Research shows those who are bullied have a higher probability of considering or performing suicide than those who are not. However, there are victims of bullying who do not end up committing suicide, and some of them share their experiences in order to send a positive message to bullying victims that suicide is not the only option.\n\nIn 2010, the suicides of teenagers in the United States who were bullied because they were gay or perceived to be led to the establishment of the It Gets Better project by Dan Savage, The online event, Spirit Day, was created in which participants were asked to wear purple as a symbol of respect for the deceased victims of bullying, particularly cyberbullying, and to signify opposition to the bullying of the LGBT community.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) states that approximately 4,400 deaths occur from suicide each year. There are about 100 attempts of suicide to every 1 successful suicide. A little over 14% of students in high school consider suicide and just about 7% of them attempt suicide. Students that are bullied are more likely to consider suicide. They are 2 to 9 times more likely to consider suicide than non-victims. A study in Britain found that at least half of suicides among young people are related to bullying. 10 to 14 year old teen girls are most likely to commit suicide based on the study from Britain. According to ABC News, nearly 30% of students are either victims of bullies or bullies themselves and 160,000 kids stay home from school every day because they are scared of being bullied.\n\n\nSuicide attempts are 2-4 times higher than heterosexual peers. Young adults of the LGBT community \"must cope with developing sexual minority identity along with negative comments, jokes, and threats of violence. A research identified that 19 studies were linked to suicidal behavior in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) students to bullying at school. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender students experience more bullying than heterosexual students.\n\nSigns of depression: \nIt may not be obvious that someone is considering suicide. In some cases a bad case of bullying may be the leading cause or trigger that leads to suicidal thoughts. In such cases where a victim of bullying has killed themselves, bullies tell the victim that they should kill him or herself and that the world would be better off without them. People that hear statements such as the one above should quickly stop and talk to the bully and let the victim know that the bully is wrong and the world would not be better off without them.\n\n"}

{"id": "2645480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2645480", "title": "Conquest of the Desert", "text": "Conquest of the Desert\n\nThe Conquest of the Desert () was a military campaign directed mainly by General Julio Argentino Roca in the 1870s with the intent to establish Argentine dominance over Patagonia, which was inhabited by indigenous peoples. Under General Roca, the Conquest of the Desert extended Argentine power into Patagonia and ended the possibility of Chilean expansion there.\n\nArgentine troops killed more than a thousand enemy combatants and displaced over 15,000 more from their traditional lands. Ethnic European settlers developed the lands for agriculture, turning it into a breadbasket that made Argentina an agricultural superpower in the early 20th century. The conquest was paralleled by a similar campaign in Chile called the Occupation of Araucanía.\n\nThe Conquest is highly controversial. Apologists have described the Conquest as bringing civilisation, while revisionists have labelled it a genocide.\n\nThe arrival of the Spanish colonists on the shores of the Río de la Plata and the foundation of the city of Buenos Aires during the 16th century led directly to the first confrontations between the Spanish and the local Indian tribes, mainly the Querandí (also called the Pampas). The Spanish had purchased the Buenos Aires hinterland from the local Indians to be used for cattle raising. This use displaced most of the animals traditionally hunted by the natives. The Indians responded by attacking the towns, killing settlers and releasing or driving off many cattle and horses from the farms. In retaliation, the Spanish colonists built forts and defended themselves from the frequent attacks.\nThe frontier dividing the colonial farms and the Indian territories gradually moved outwards from Buenos Aires; at the end of the 18th century, the Salado River was the boundary between the civilizations. Many Indians were forced to abandon their tribes to work on the farms. Some assimilated or intermarried with the white population. The group known as gauchos developed from working on the ranches.\n\nAfter Argentina achieved independence in 1816, the provinces had numerous conflicts as they struggled over how to organize. Once these were settled, the government wanted to quickly occupy the lands claimed by the young republic (in part to prevent Chile from encroaching on it). It also wanted to increase the national agricultural production and offer new lands to prospective immigrants.\n\nIn 1833 Juan Manuel de Rosas in Buenos Aires Province and other military leaders in the Cuyo region coordinated offensives to try to exterminate the resistant indigenous tribes, but only Rosas' expedition achieved some success. By this time Chile had founded Punta Arenas in Magellan Strait in 1845, which threatened the Argentine claims in Patagonia. Later in 1861 Chile began the occupation of the Araucanía, which alarmed Argentine authorities because of its rival's growing influence in the zone. Chile had defeated the Mapuche in their central region. This indigenous tribe had strong language and cultural ties to the nomadic tribes on the east side of the Andes, with whom they share the same language.\n\nIn 1872 the indigenous leader Calfucurá and his 6,000 followers attacked the cities of General Alvear, Veinticinco de Mayo and Nueve de Julio. They killed 300 settlers and drove off 200,000 head of cattle. These events were a catalyst for the government to mount the Conquest of the Desert.\n\nThe Indians drove the stolen cattle from the incursions (\"malones\") to Chile through the Rastrillada de los chilenos and traded them for goods. The historian George V. Rauch notes evidence that Chilean authorities knew about the origin of the cattle and consented to the trading in order to strengthen their influence over Patagonian territories. They expected eventually to occupy those lands in the future.\n\nIn 1875 Adolfo Alsina, Minister of War under President Nicolás Avellaneda, presented the government with a plan which he later described as having the goal \"to populate the desert, and not to destroy the Indians.\"\n\nThe first step was to connect Buenos Aires and the \"Fortines\" (fortresses) with telegraph lines. The government signed a peace treaty with chieftain Juan José Catriel. But he broke it a short time later, as together with chieftain \"Namuncurá\" and 3,500 warriors, he attacked Tres Arroyos, Tandil, Azul, and other towns and farms. The casualties were higher than in 1872: Catriel and Namuncurá's forces killed 400 settlers, captured 300, and drove off 300,000 head of cattle.\n\nAlsina attacked the Indians, forcing them to fall back, and leaving \"fortines\" on his way south to protect the conquered territories. He also constructed the 374 km long trench named zanja de Alsina (\"Alsina's trench\"). It was supposed to be a fortified border to the unconquered territories. Three metres wide and two metres deep, it served as an obstacle to cattle drives by the Indians.\n\nThe Indians continued taking cattle from farms in the Buenos Aires Province and the south of the Mendoza Province, but found it difficult to escape as the animals slowed their march. They had to confront the patrolling units that followed them. As the war went on, some Indians eventually signed peace treaties and settled among the \"Christians\" behind the lines of forts. Some tribes allied with the Argentine government, standing neutral or, less often, fighting for the Argentine army. In return, they were granted periodical shipments of cattle and food. After Alsina died in 1877, Julio Argentino Roca was appointed Minister of War, and decided to change the strategy.\n\nJulio Argentino Roca, in contrast to Alsina, believed that the only solution against the Indian threat was to extinguish, subdue or expel them.\n\nAt the end of 1878 he started the first sweep to \"clean\" the area between the Alsina trench and the Negro river by continuous and systematic attacks on the Indian settlements. On 6 December 1878, elements of the Puán Division under Colonel Teodoro García clashed with a war party at the Lihué Calel heights. In a brief but hard fought battle, 50 Indians were killed, 270 captured, and 33 settlers were freed.\n\nNumerous armed encounters would follow, until by December 1878, over 4,000 Indians had been captured and 400 killed, 150 settlers freed and 15,000 head of cattle recovered.\n\nWith 6,000 soldiers armed with new breech-loading Remington rifles, in 1879 he began the second sweep reaching Choele Choel in two months, after killing 1,313 Indians and capturing over 15,000. From other points, southbound companies made their way down to the Negro River and the Neuquén River, a northern tributary of the Negro River. Together, both rivers marked the natural frontier from the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean. This attack led to a large migration of Mapuches into the zone around Curarrehue and Pucón, Chile.\n\nMany settlements were built on the basin of these two rivers, as well as a number on the Colorado River. By sea, some settlements were erected on the southern basin of the Chubut River mainly by Welsh colonists in y Wladfa.\n\nRoca followed Nicolás Avellaneda as president. He thought it was imperative to conquer the territory south of the Negro River as soon as possible, and ordered the 1881 campaign under the control of Colonel Conrado Villegas.\n\nWithin a year Villegas conquered the Neuquén Province (he reached the Limay River). The campaign continued to push the Indian resistance further south, to fight the last battle on October 18, 1884. The last rebel group of over 3,000 members under the command of chieftains Inacayal and Foyel surrendered two months later in present Chubut Province.\n\nTo counteract the Argentine conquest of Patagonia, the Chileans supplied arms, ammunition and horses to their Indian Mapuche allies. On 16 January 1883, a 10-man section of a platoon of the Argentine Army in pursuit of a large Indian war party, ran into an ambush in the Pulmarí Valley set up by Chilean soldiers, and in the engagement that followed Captain Emilio Crouzeilles along with Lieutenant Nicolas Lazcano and several privates were killed. On 17 February 1883, Lieutenant-Colonel Juan Díaz, at the head of a 16-man Argentine infantry detachment, was trailing a war party of 100 to 150 Indians. Upon reaching Pulmarí Valley, they were surrounded by the Indians and around 50 Chilean soldiers. Heavily outnumbered, the Argentine soldiers skillfully outfought their attackers, including a bayonet charge mounted by the Chilean detachment. On 21 February 1883, according to Argentine Army Major Manuel Prado, 150-200 Indians armed with Winchesters and Martini–Henry rifles attacked an Argentine Army detachment operating on the Argentine-Chilean border, and in a four-hour engagement killed or wounded 22 Argentine soldiers at a cost of some 100 warriors.\n\nHistorian Jens Andermann has noted that contemporary sources on the campaign indicate that the Conquest was intended by the Argentine government to exterminate the indigenous tribes, and thus attempt genocide. First-hand accounts state that Argentine troops killed prisoners and committed \"mass executions\". The 15,000 Indians taken captive \"became servants or prisoners and were prevented from having children.\"\n\nApologists perceive the campaign as intending to conquer specifically those groups of Indians that refused to submit to Argentine law and frequently carried out brutal attacks on frontier civilian settlements. In these attacks, Indians stole many horses and cattle, killed men defending their livestock and captured women and children to become the slaves and/or forced brides of Indian warriors.\n\n\"The Guardian\" alleged in 2011 that two education officials lost their jobs due to the controversy over the Conquest of the Desert: It alleged that Juan José Cresto was forced to resign as a director of the Argentine National Historical Museum because he \"said the Indians were violent parasites who attacked farms and kidnapped women\" and Beatriz Horn, a history teacher in La Pampa Province, was fired for \"telling a radio station that Roca deserved praise for putting Indians to flight and opening Argentina's frontier to European settlers.\" Argentine news sources, however, report Juan José Cresto lost his job for being abusive and violent towards employees and the firing of Beatriz Horn was primarily due to her praise for the military dictator Leopoldo Galtieri.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3218783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3218783", "title": "Drug development", "text": "Drug development\n\nDrug development is the process of bringing a new pharmaceutical drug to the market once a lead compound has been identified through the process of drug discovery. It includes pre-clinical research on microorganisms and animals, filing for regulatory status, such as via the United States Food and Drug Administration for an investigational new drug to initiate clinical trials on humans, and may include the step of obtaining regulatory approval with a new drug application to market the drug.\n\nBroadly, the process of drug development can be divided into pre-clinical and clinical work.\n\nNew chemical entities (NCEs, also known as new molecular entities or NMEs) are compounds that emerge from the process of drug discovery. These have promising activity against a particular biological target that is important in disease. However, little is known about the safety, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of this NCE in humans. It is the function of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"first-in-man\" [FIM] or First Human Dose [FHD]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the physicochemical properties of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility. Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a medicinal chemist producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and ton scale. They further examine the product for suitability to package as capsules, tablets, aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or intravenous formulations. Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as \"chemistry, manufacturing, and control\" (CMC).\n\nMany aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the regulatory requirements of drug licensing authorities. These generally constitute a number of tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans. It is a legal requirement that an assessment of major organ toxicity be performed (effects on the heart and lungs, brain, kidney, liver and digestive system), as well as effects on other parts of the body that might be affected by the drug (e.g., the skin if the new drug is to be delivered through the skin). Increasingly, these tests are made using \"in vitro\" methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.\n\nThe information is gathered from this pre-clinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in the US, to the FDA), as an Investigational New Drug application or IND. If the IND is approved, development moves to the clinical phase.\n\nClinical trials involve three or four steps:\n\nThe process of defining characteristics of the drug does not stop once an NCE begins human clinical trials. In addition to the tests required to move a novel drug into the clinic for the first time, manufacturers must ensure that any long-term or chronic toxicities are well-defined, including effects on systems not previously monitored (fertility, reproduction, immune system, among others). They must also test the compound for its potential to cause cancer (carcinogenicity testing).\n\nIf a compound emerges from these tests with an acceptable toxicity and safety profile, and the company can further show it has the desired effect in clinical trials, then the NCE portfolio of evidence can be submitted for marketing approval in the various countries where the manufacturer plans to sell it. In the United States, this process is called a \"new drug application\" or NDA.\n\nMost NCEs fail during drug development, either because they have unacceptable toxicity or because they simply do not have the intended effect on the targeted disease as shown in clinical trials.\n\nA trend toward the collection of biomarker and genetic information from clinical trial participants, and increasing investment by companies in this area, led by 2018 to fully half of all drug trials collecting this information, the prevalence reaching above 80% among oncology trials.\n\nThe full cost of bringing a new drug (i.e., new chemical entity) to market – from discovery through clinical trials to approval – is complex and controversial. Typically, companies spend tens to hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. One element of the complexity is that the much-publicized final numbers often not only include the out-of-pocket expenses for conducting a series of Phase I-III clinical trials, but also the \"capital costs\" of the long period (10 or more years) during which the company must cover out-of-pocket costs for preclinical drug discovery. Additionally, companies often do not report whether a given figure includes the capitalized cost or comprises only out-of-pocket expenses, or both.\n\nAnother element of complexity is that all estimates are based on confidential information controlled by drug companies, released by them voluntarily, leading to inability to verify costs. The numbers are controversial, as drug companies use them to justify the prices of their drugs and various advocates for lower drug prices have challenged them. The controversy is not only between \"high\" and \"low\", but also the high numbers may vary considerably for the manifold factors in drug development.\n\nOne study assessed both capitalized and out-of-pocket costs for bringing a single new drug to market as about US$1.8 billion and $870 million, respectively.\n\nIn an analysis of the drug development costs for 98 companies over a decade, the average cost per drug developed and approved by a single-drug company was $350 million. But for companies that approved between eight and 13 drugs over 10 years, the cost per drug went as high as $5.5 billion, due mainly to geographic expansion for marketing and ongoing costs for Phase IV trials and continuous monitoring for safety.\n\nAlternatives to conventional drug development have the objective for universities, governments and pharmaceutical industry to collaborate and optimize resources.\n\nThe nature of a drug development project is characterised by high attrition rates, large capital expenditures, and long timelines. This makes the valuation of such projects and companies a challenging task. Not all valuation methods can cope with these particularities. The most commonly used valuation methods are risk-adjusted net present value (rNPV), decision trees, real options, or comparables.\n\nThe most important value drivers are the cost of capital or discount rate that is used, phase attributes such as duration, success rates, and costs, and the forecasted sales, including cost of goods and marketing and sales expenses. Less objective aspects like quality of the management or novelty of the technology should be reflected in the cash flows estimation.\n\nCandidates for a new drug to treat a disease might, theoretically, include from 5,000 to 10,000 chemical compounds. On average about 250 of these show sufficient promise for further evaluation using laboratory tests, mice and other test animals. Typically, about ten of these qualify for tests on humans. A study conducted by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development covering the 1980s and 1990s found that only 21.5 percent of drugs that started Phase I trials were eventually approved for marketing. In the time period of 2006 to 2015, the success rate was 9.6%. The high failure rates associated with pharmaceutical development are referred to as the \"attrition rate\" problem. Careful decision making during drug development is essential to avoid costly failures. In many cases, intelligent programme and clinical trial design can prevent false negative results. Well-designed, dose-finding studies and comparisons against both a placebo and a gold-standard treatment arm play a major role in achieving reliable data.\n\nNovel initiatives include partnering between governmental organizations and industry. The world's largest such initiative is the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), and examples of major national initiatives are Top Institute Pharma in the Netherlands and Biopeople in Denmark. In 2004, the FDA created the “Critical Path Initiative” to guide the new drug development process.\n\n\n"}

Daniel Holloway was a doctor, one of just a few African Americans practicing medicine at the time. As a boy, Holloway often accompanied his father as he made housecalls on horseback in Southwest Philadelphia. After graduating from Central High School and Howard University, the son followed his father into the medical profession. He interned at Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C., before returning to his hometown in 1937 and starting his own practice in North Philadelphia.\n\nHe married Mildred Brazington in 1938, but they divorced in the early 1940s. In 1944, he married again, to Ruth Smart, a social worker. Holloway quickly became recognized as one of the top men in his field; despite a lack of formal post-graduate training, he was certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine in 1946. In 1950, he became the second black doctor ever elected to the American College of Physicians. In 1955, he was the first ever elected to the American Board of Cardiovascular Diseases.\n\nIn 1953, Holloway married again, to Carmen Chisholm, with whom he later had two daughters, Michelle and Cheryl. That same year, he ran in the local election for Philadelphia city coroner as a Republican and won. He never took office, however, as the Democratic-majority City Council abolished several county offices, including coroner, and converted the jobs to civil service positions. Holloway and city treasurer Francis D. Pastorius filed suit to retain their offices, but were unsuccessful.\n\nMeanwhile, Holloway's medical career progressed as he rose from an instructor at Women's Medical College to a clinical associate professor of medicine. He also gained a reputation as an engaging speaker at medical conferences. He served as the final chief of staff at Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital and the only chief of staff at its successor, Mercy-Douglass Hospital.\n\nHolloway and his wife divorced in 1977.

At an early age, Elena would write protests in verse, such as an early piece about children being prevented from seeing a film. She later adopted the surname Gremina, a combination of her parent's surnames so as to be able to write without being compared to her them. Gremina studied at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute to become a playwright.\n\nGrebnav's first production took place in 1983, but only came to prominence in the 1990s after her plays were performed at the Moscow Pushkin Drama Theatre and she won awards from Westdeutscher Rundfunk. A favoured subject matter of Grebnav in this period was conflicted women of history. Grebnav married in 1993. Together with her husband and father, she created the television series, \"\".\n\nAfter being influenced by Elyse Dodgson at the Royal Court Theatre, London, Gremina and her husband founded . When they heard Dodgson talk about the use of verbatim techniques in theatre to present factual stories on the stage, they decided that it was a way to reconnect Russian theatre with the public in their home country. The duo started Teatr.doc in 2002, and soon began to present performances based on current events.\n\nThe performances became more political in nature, which resulted in Gremina and her husband being visited by the police and having equipment confiscated. One such piece written by Gremina was on the death of Sergei Magnitsky, an anticorruption lawyer. After a police raid of Teatr.doc in 2015 that saw three members of the production temporarily arrested and sets destroyed, Gremina was summoned to the Ministry of Culture where she was threatened with further raids. \n\nUgarov died following a heart attack in April 2018.

Police noted that Ramos was a relative of a known figure inside the underworld known as \"El Fayo.\"\n\nElidio Ramos Zárate worked for \"El Sur\" for 10 years as a crime journalist before he was killed. Ramos worked in a popular genre of sensationalist, tabloid style of crime journalism known in Mexico as nota roja. He was assigned to cover the protest by the CNTE, who were protesting the government. Although he was a known crime reporter in the region, Ramos was not, according to his editor, threatened before he covered the CNTE protests. His editor said, \"As a journalist, in this area and in these situations, you are extra exposed. We're not safe from anyone. Sometimes it's the protesters, other times the police, other times criminals, like now.\"\n\nThe teacher's union CNTE organized protests across Oaxaca to protest against charges against union leaders and education policy changes involving the evaluations of teachers. A day before Ramos was killed, masked men at the protest threatened him, as well as other journalists taking photos of vandals in Juchitán, Oaxaca, Mexico.\n\nThe next day, on June 19, 2016, violence between the police and protesters erupted, and, as a result, eight protesters were killed, a bus was burned, more than 100 police and protesters were injured, and over 20 people were arrested. Ramos was photographed multiple times posing in front of a burning bus.\n\nThe fatal attack on Ramos occurred several hours after he had finished reporting on the main protest site at Asunción Nochixtlán, on a major road that connected Oaxaca to Mexico City, and the burning bus that had been set on fire by the protesters. During the protests, looting and vandalism around the city occurred, and Ramos happened to observe and photograph one of the four OXXO convenience stores looted that day as it was being looted. Elidio Ramos Zárate was shot in the neck by two unknown men on foot or on motorcycles outside of the OXXO with 9 mm caliber firearm and killed around 4 p.m. His body was found on a park bench across the street from the OXXO about a quarter of a mile from the protest.\n\nThe killers also shot and wounded two people around Ramos. Raúl Cano López, who was the brother of an owner of another regional newspaper \"Punto Crítico\", was also shot in the attack but died in the ambulance en route to the hospital. Cano happened to be on the bench at the bus stop at the time. The other person, who was unidentified in reports, was also at the bus stop and wounded in the attack. The wounded were taken to the Macedonio Benitez Fuentes special hospital.\n\nNo suspects have been charged with the murder but the investigation is ongoing.\n\nPresident Enrique Peña Nieto's government had recently charged two union leaders with embezzlement and was attempting to change the evaluation of teachers, while at the state level in Oaxaca over 4,000 teachers were on lay off. The protest was organized by the CNTE teachers union in response. The battle over education reform in this southern state in Mexico has been ongoing for almost 10 years in Oaxaca and previous demonstrations had also led to violence.\n\nAurelio Nuño, Mexico's Secretary of Education, held a meeting after the shooting. He said future meetings will resolve around peace and nothing else.\n\nIrina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO said, \"I condemn the killing of Elidio Ramos Zárate. Serving as the eyes and ears of society, journalists must be able to carry out their important work without fearing for their lives. It is therefore important that those responsible for this crime be brought to justice.\"\n\nA spokesperson from Reporters Without Borders said, \"We urge the authorities to conduct exhaustive investigations into these fatal shootings and under no circumstances to rule out the possibility that they were linked to the victims' work as a journalists.\"\n\nIvonne Flores, a reporter for \"El Sur,\" complained about the working conditions in the state of Oaxaca and stated that reporters are unable to do their work and cover material as it should be covered because of the dangers that come with their career.\n\n"}

Among the questions addressed in the field are:\n\n\nContemporary discussions of the ethics of belief stem largely from a famous nineteenth-century exchange between the British mathematician and philosopher W. K. Clifford and the American philosopher William James. In 1877 Clifford published an article titled \"The Ethics of Belief\" in a journal called \"Contemporary Review\". There Clifford argued for a strict form of evidentialism that he summed up in a famous dictum: \"It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone to believe anything on insufficient evidence.\" As Clifford saw it, people have intellectual as well as moral duties, and both are extremely demanding. People who base their beliefs on wishful thinking, self-interest, blind faith, or other such unreliable grounds are not merely intellectually slovenly; they are immoral. Such bad intellectual habits harm both themselves and society. We sin grievously against our moral and intellectual duty when we form beliefs on insufficient evidence, or ignore or dismiss evidence that is relevant to our beliefs.\n\nClifford's article provoked a spirited reply from the Harvard philosopher and psychologist William James. In his 1896 essay \"The Will to Believe,\" James argued that there are times when it is permissible, or even obligatory, to form a belief even though we lack sufficient evidence for it. One sort of example he cites is \"precursive faith,\" when belief runs ahead of the evidence but is essential for success (e.g., borderline-excessive self-confidence in an athlete). James made clear that he was not endorsing wishful thinking. He set forth strict conditions for when it was OK to believe without intellectually adequate evidence. Specifically, James laid down that (1) there must be no compelling evidence one way or another (i.e., the issue is \"intellectually undecidable\"), (2) both options must be \"live hypotheses\" for the relevant chooser (i.e., the chooser could sincerely believe either option), (3) the choice must be \"forced\" in the sense that one of the two options must definitely be chosen, and refusing to choose is tantamount to making one of the two choices, and (4) the choice must be \"momentous\" (i.e., deeply important or significant to the chooser). Famously, James argued that for many people the decision whether or not to believe in God satisfies these four conditions. Such people, James claims, have both an intellectual and a moral right to believe in God, even though by their own admission they lack sufficient evidence to justify this choice.\n\nMany thinkers before Clifford and James had important things to say about the ethics of belief. In ancient Greece, Socrates stressed the importance of self-examination, the pursuit of wisdom, and admitting how little one knows. Ancient skeptics such as Pyrrho, Arcesilaus, and Sextus Empiricus argued that we should suspend judgment on most controversial matters because powerful and perhaps equally compelling arguments can always be given on both sides. In modern times, René Descartes wrote extensively on norms of intellectual inquiry in his \"Discourse on Method\" (1637), as did John Locke in Book 4 of his \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690). Three important thinkers--Blaise Pascal, Immanuel Kant, and Søren Kierkegaard—anticipated James in rejecting evidentialism and arguing that there are important matters on which, for practical or existential grounds, we should believe even if we lack sufficient evidence.\n\nRules or standards that properly govern responsible belief-formation and the pursuit of intellectual excellence are what philosophers call epistemic (or \"doxastic\") norms. Widely accepted epistemic norms include:\n\n\n\n"}

It stars an ensemble cast of Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, John Hawkes, Robin Wright, Michael Kelly, Sam Worthington, Keira Knightley, Emily Watson, and Jake Gyllenhaal. It is based on the real events of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, and focuses on the survival attempts of two expedition groups, one led by Rob Hall (Clarke) and the other by Scott Fischer (Gyllenhaal).\n\nThe film opened the 72nd Venice International Film Festival on September 2, 2015, and was released theatrically on September 18, 2015. It was first released in IMAX 3D on September 11, 2015, in the UK and in IMAX 3D, RealD 3D, and 2D internationally, and exclusively in IMAX 3D, September 19, 2015 as a limited release in the United States and Canada, and along 36 other countries. It began a wide release in the United States on September 25, 2015. The film was a commercial success, grossing $203 million worldwide over a $55 million budget and received positive reviews from critics.\n\nIn May 1996, several commercial expeditions at base camp of Mount Everest prepare for a climb to the summit. Rob Hall, who popularized commercial Everest missions, leads Adventure Consultants; Scott Fischer is chief guide for Rob's rival, Mountain Madness. Rob's clients include Beck Weathers, an experienced climber; Doug Hansen, a former mailman pursuing his dream; climbing veteran Yasuko Namba, who hopes to complete her final Seven Summits ascent; and \"Outside\" magazine journalist Jon Krakauer. Helen Wilton manages Rob's base camp.\n\nA month earlier in New Zealand, Rob says goodbye to his pregnant wife Jan and promises that he will be home for the birth. At the base camp Rob receives a fax from her, informing him that their baby, not yet born, is a girl. He wants to name her Sarah, but Jan disagrees.\n\nWorried about climber crowding, Rob persuades Scott to cooperate to reduce delays. On the summit attempt, Rob's group departs Camp IV before dawn, planning to complete the ascent and turn around by 2:00 P.M., the latest safe time for return before nightfall. The group is delayed over an hour after discovering that guide ropes are not installed on upper reaches of the climb. Beck has eyesight problems and stops. Rob tells him to return if his condition does not improve in a half-hour. Scott hurries back down to camp to help another climber, but plans to re-ascend. Rob warns him about overexertion.\n\nRob reaches the summit on time and is joined by other climbers including Yasuko, who jubilantly plants her Japanese flag in the snow. Descending, Rob encounters Doug struggling just above the Hillary Step and orders him to turn back. Doug insists on continuing, saying that he won't get the chance again. Rob reluctantly agrees and they reach the summit two hours later, well past safe return time. At the summit, Doug is exhausted and increasingly suffering from altitude sickness. Also at the top is Scott, exhausted and increasingly ill from high-altitude pulmonary edema.\n\nAs Rob helps Doug descend, a blizzard strikes the mountain and Doug's oxygen tank is empty, causing him to suffer hypoxia. No extra bottles are stored on the route where Rob asked and he radios Helen to send someone up with oxygen. Doug, left alone briefly by Rob, semi-consciously detaches himself from the guide rope and walks unsteadily along the narrow path. He silently topples to his death a moment later.\n\nScott's condition worsens. He tells his fellow climbers to continue descending without him. He lies down and later dies. Returning climbers reach Beck, whose vision is still impaired, but they all become lost as the blizzard obliterates the trail. Three climbers go for help, leaving Beck and Yasuko behind.\n\nGuide Andy 'Harold' Harris reaches Rob with spare oxygen, but it is frozen shut. They huddle in place in the storm. While Rob sleeps, Andy begins to have hallucinations. He strips off his outer clothing and slides off the mountainside to his death. In the morning, Rob radios Helen that Doug and Andy are gone, and that his hands and feet are frozen. Helen calls Jan, hoping Rob will respond to her voice. Jan tells Rob that he must start moving. Rob tells her that he is cold but comfortable, and asks her to name their baby Sarah. He dies soon after.\n\nReturning climbers tell the camp that Beck and Yasuko are stranded. The weather, however, makes rescue impossible. Helen calls Beck's wife, Peach, and informs her of the situation. In the morning, Beck miraculously awakens, witnesses Yasuko's corpse, and stumbles back to camp alone, severely frostbitten, and in desperate need of medical help. Peach calls the American Embassy and organizes a helicopter rescue. Nepal Army pilot Lt. Col. Madan Khatri Chhetri successfully flies a harrowing high altitude mission to evacuate Beck. Meanwhile, one of Scott's guides, Anatoli, finds his body, and moves it off the trail.\n\nReturning home, Helen has an emotional reunion with Jan, who later gives birth and names her daughter Sarah. Beck returns to his family, heavily bandaged. Closing titles reveal that he lost both hands and nose to severe frostbite, and that Rob's body remains on Everest.\n\nBaltasar Kormákur directed the film, about the 1996 disastrous expedition to scale Mount Everest, which was scripted by Simon Beaufoy and Mark Medoff, with early script adaptations carried out by Justin Isbell and William Nicholson. The film was produced by Working Title Films. Universal Pictures distributes the film in the United States. The film was produced by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, and started shooting in November 2013. In September 2013, Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films were set to co-finance the film, but in October they exited as co-financiers.\n\nAfter the production start date of 6 November 2013 had passed, Cross Creek Pictures and Walden Media joined the production on 12 November 2013, and financed the film with $65 million. The film started production on 13 January 2014, in the Ötztal Alps in Italy, after which production moved to Nepal and Iceland. On 11 December 2013, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" posted that South Tyrol's regional film board added $1 million to the film's funding.\n\nOn 30 January 2014, Universal set a 27 February 2015 release date for the film, but on 21 March 2014, it was moved to 18 September 2015.\n\nAs of 19 February 2013, Christian Bale was in talks to join the cast of the disaster film to play Rob Hall, the leader of a New Zealand group who ran Adventure Consultants. On 17 July, Jake Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin, Jason Clarke and John Hawkes were cast as leads in the film. Bale dropped out around this time. Gyllenhaal played Scott Fischer, the leader of the Mountain Madness expedition; Brolin played Beck Weathers, a doctor; Clarke took the role of Rob Hall, also an expedition leader; and Hawkes played Doug Hansen, one of Rob Hall's clients, who encounters difficulties on the descent from the summit of Everest.\n\nOn 4 February 2014, Clive Standen also joined the cast, while shooting was underway. On 7 February 2014, more cast was added to the film, including Martin Henderson, Emily Watson, Thomas M. Wright, and Michael Kelly. Watson played a motherly base camp figure who works closely with Rob Hall, and Kelly played \"Into Thin Air\" author Jon Krakauer. On 17 February, actor Micah Hauptman was added to the cast in the role of filmmaker and mountaineer David Breashears, who directed the 1998 IMAX documentary film \"Everest\". On 24 March 2014, Sam Worthington and Robin Wright joined the cast. Worthington played Guy Cotter and Wright played Beck Weathers' wife, Peach. On 1 May, DailyMail.co.uk revealed that Keira Knightley had joined the film as Jan Arnold, Rob Hall's pregnant wife.\n\nIn November 2013, the film was set for a 13 January 2014 production start date in Italy. Co-financier Brian Oliver told \"Variety\" they would shoot in Ötztal Alps in Italy for six weeks, a month in Iceland, and then move to Nepal for another month's shoot. In early January 2014, actors Gyllenhaal and Brolin were practicing for climbing mountains in the Santa Monica Mountains, to train for their roles.\n\nThe 44-member crew arrived on 12 January 2014 in Nepal and stayed in Kathmandu. They had permission to film from 9 to 23 January. Later filming on \"Everest\" commenced on 13 January 2014. On 14 January, Brolin and Hawkes filmed shots at local terminal of Tribhuvan International Airport, and then they were to be filming at Lukla Airport on 15 January, then to Namche Bazaar, and later at the Everest Base Camp, news confirmed. After shooting completed in Nepal, the crews were to move to Italy (Schnalstal and Rome), and then in early March to the United Kingdom, to film at Pinewood Studios. On 23 February 2014, Gyllenhaal was spotted in Rome during filming, which recently wrapped up in Nepal. Brolin was also spotted with his assistant, Kathryn Boyd.\n\nEnglish actor Clive Standen has said that filming on location in freezing temperatures has been \"tough but fun\". On 24 March 2014 the shooting was said to be taking place at the Everest Base Camp in Nepal. Base camp exteriors were filmed on the backlot at Cinecitta Studios in Rome, where bright sunlight could be achieved to resemble the lighting at base camp.\n\nOn 18 April 2014, while the second unit crew was shooting remaining scenes of the film at Camp II on Everest, an avalanche struck, killing 16 Sherpa guides. The Sherpas were carrying equipment and supplies to camps for climbers in advance of the start of the summer climbing season. \"Deadline\" reported there were no injuries or fatalities affecting the film crew. The production was not present where the disaster took place, but they were nearby. Filming at Pinewood Studios in England was just about to finish up, but the second unit was shooting at the camp which then had to halt the production for some time. Hillary Step, camp 4, icefall and the summit were built on the 007 stage at Pinewood Studios with greenscreen for CG backgrounds. Totino said, \"It was very challenging because we had to re-create the sun, which at Everest is so incredibly sharp and crisp.\" The team used SoftSun lights for creating sun on the summit, Hillary Step and icefall. \"They were 9 feet long and 3 ½ feet in diameter and 100,000 watts. They had to be moved around on cranes because they are very heavy,\" Totino said. To photograph one scene during which expedition guide Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) is stuck on the mountain in the storm, Totino recalled: \"We tented off a portion of the set with some very heavy plastic and brought in these giant refrigerating units, half the size of a semi truck, and we cooled that part of the stage down to about 26 to 28 degrees Fahrenheit [around -3°C] and brought in real snow. Baltasar really wanted the actor to feel like he was frozen. You really see and feel that.\" The film was shot with Arri Alexa XT cameras, using the Arriraw format.\n\nDario Marianelli composed the music for the film. The film uses the song \"Yeh ladka hai Allah\" from the Bollywood film \"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham\" (2001), when the climbing party first arrives in Nepal. The song plays in the bus when it passes through a busy Nepali bazaar. Another song in the film is \"All I Wanna Do\", performed by Sheryl Crow, which is accurate to the timing of the film's events, in 1996. The song \"Weather with You\" by Crowded House also features in the film. The soundtrack was released on 18 September 2015 by Varèse Sarabande.\n\nUniversal Pictures had originally slated the film for a 27 February 2015 release date in the United States and Canada. However, the film was released on 18 September 2015 exclusively in IMAX 3D, followed by a wide theatrical release on 25 September 2015. In the United States and Canada, it was released in Dolby Vision format in Dolby Cinema, the first ever for Universal Pictures. It was screened at the 2015 CineEurope on 23 June 2015 at the Centre Convencions Internacional Barcelona in full 3D Dolby Atmos. The film's world premiere took place on 2 September 2015 at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival in the Sala Grande, at the city's Palazzo del Cinema in Venice.\n\nOn 12 February 2014, the first photo from the set of the film was revealed, featuring Clarke. On 4 June 2015, the first trailer for the film was released online, with an appeal for relief for the April 2015 Nepal earthquake through Oxfam America in the coda.\n\nDVD, Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D versions were released on 19 January 2016. On 27 September 2016, Universal Studios Home Entertainment released a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc edition of the film.\n\n\"Everest\" grossed $43.4 million in North America and $159.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $203.4 million, against a budget of $55 million. \"Everest\" had the biggest September worldwide IMAX opening with $7.2 million, breaking the record previously held by \"\" ($6 million).\n\nPrior to its wide theatrical opening in the United States and Canada on 25 September, the film received a limited release in IMAX 3D and other premium large format screens across 545 theaters on 18 September in order to build good word of mouth. It made $325,000 from 481 IMAX screens and premium large-format screens from late night showings, which began at 7 pm, and an estimated $2.3 million on its opening day. It finished off the weekend at number five with $7.6 million from 368 IMAX and 177 premium large-format theaters. IMAX comprised 78% ($5.8 million) of the opening weekend gross while premium large formats contributed 22% ($1.7 million). This broke the record for the biggest IMAX September debut (breaking \"The Equalizer\"s $3.1 million record in 2014). \"Everest\" is the first major film since \"\" (2011) to receive IMAX only release for more than two days (\"The Walk\" became the next when it replaced \"Everest\" on 30 September 2015).\n\n\"Everest\" expanded into a total of 3,006 theaters on Friday after a limited 3D, IMAX and other premium large formats engagement. It earned $4 million on its wide opening day on Friday. During its wide opening weekend it earned $13.09 million from 3,006 theaters of which $3.7 million came from 366 IMAX screens raising its total North America IMAX revenue to $11.5 million—the first ever September IMAX release to reach past $10 million. The largest demographic of the opening weekend audience was male (51%) and under the age of 35 (45%).\n\nInternationally, \"Everest\" was released in a total of 65 countries. In its opening weekend, it grossed $28.8 million from 5,154 screens from 36 markets opening at No. 1 in 12 countries. IMAX comprised $3 million of the opening gross. In its second weekend, it expanded to 22 more markets earning $33.9 million from 62 markets—topping the box office. Russia and the CIS posted the highest opening with $5.2 million followed by the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($4.9 million), Mexico ($4.4 million), Germany ($2.9 million) and Australia ($2.4 million). In terms of total earnings, the United Kingdom ($16 million) and Germany ($9.3 million) are the largest markets. It became the 8th Universal Pictures film of 2015 to cross the £10 million mark in the United Kingdom. The only other studios ever to achieve the feat are 20th Century Fox in 2014 and Paramount Pictures in 2011. It opened in China on 3 November and Japan on 6 November and grossed $11.3 million and $1.4 million respectively debuting both at No. 4 at the box office. In China notably, despite having the advantage of securing all the IMAX screens, it had to face serious competition with Hollywood counterparts such as \"\", \"The Peanuts Movie\" and four new local movies that all opened that same week. It has so far grossed a total of $16 million in China and $5.1 million in Japan.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 73%, based on 220 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's consensus reads, \"\"Everest\" boasts all the dizzying cinematography a person could hope to get out a movie about mountain climbers, even if it's content to tread less challenging narrative terrain.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 64 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nJon Krakauer, author of \"Into Thin Air\", denounced the movie, stating some of its details were fabricated and defamatory. He also expressed regret regarding Sony's rapid acquisition of the rights to the book. Director Baltasar Kormákur responded, claiming Krakauer's first-person account was not used as source material for the film and alleging that Krakauer's version conflicted with actual events.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16849002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16849002", "title": "FGF21", "text": "FGF21\n\nFibroblast growth factor 21 is a protein that in mammals is encoded by the \"FGF21\" gene. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family and specifically a member of the endocrine subfamily which includes FGF23 and FGF15/19. FGF21 is the primary endogenous agonist of the FGF21 receptor, which is composed of the co-receptors FGF receptor 1 and β-Klotho.\n\nFGF family members possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities and are involved in a variety of biological processes including embryonic development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, tumor growth and invasion. FGFs act through a family of four FGF receptors. Binding is complicated and requires both interaction of the FGF molecule with an FGF receptor and binding to heparin through an heparin binding domain. Endocrine FGFs lack a heparin binding domain and thus can be released into the circulation.\n\nFGF21 is a hepatokine – i.e., a hormone secreted by the liver – that regulates simple sugar intake and preferences for sweet foods via signaling through FGF21 receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and correlates with reduced dopamine neurotransmission within the nucleus accumbens.\n\nA single-nucleotide polymorphism of the FGF21 gene – the FGF21 rs838133 variant – has been identified as a genetic mechanism responsible for the sweet tooth behavioral phenotype, a trait associated with cravings for sweets and high sugar consumption, in both humans and mice.\n\nFGF21 is specifically induced by mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) activity. The oxidized form of ketone bodies (acetoacetate) in a cultured medium also induced FGF21, possibly via a sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)-dependent mechanism. HMGCS2 activity has also been shown to be increased by deacetylation of lysines 310, 447, and 473 via SIRT3 in the mitochondria.\n\nWhile FGF21 is expressed in numerous tissues, including liver, brown adipose tissue, white adipose tissue (WAT) and pancreas, circulating levels of FGF21 are derived specifically from the liver in mice. In liver FGF21 expression is regulated by PPARα and levels rise substantially with both fasting and consumption of ketogenic diets.\n\nLiver X receptor (LXR) represses FGF21 in humans via an LXR response element located from -37 to -22 bp on the human FGF21 promoter.\n\nFGF21 stimulates glucose uptake in adipocytes but not in other cell types. This effect is additive to the activity of insulin. FGF21 treatment of adipocytes is associated with phosphorylation of FRS2, a protein linking FGF receptors to the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. FGF21 injection in ob/ob mice results in an increase in Glut1 in adipose tissue. FGF21 also protects animals from diet-induced obesity when overexpressed in transgenic mice and lowers blood glucose and triglyceride levels when administered to diabetic rodents. Treatment of animals with FGF21 results in increased energy expenditure, fat utilization and lipid excretion.\n\nBeta Klotho () functions as a cofactor essential for FGF21 activity.\n\nIn cows plasma FGF21 was nearly undetectable in late pregnancy (LP), peaked at parturition, and then stabilized at lower, chronically elevated concentrations during early lactation (EL). Plasma FGF21 was similarly increased in the absence of parturition when an energy-deficit state was induced by feed restricting late-lactating dairy cows, implicating energy insufficiency as a cause of chronically elevated FGF21 in EL. The liver was the major source of plasma FGF21 in early lactation with little or no contribution by WAT, skeletal muscle, and mammary gland. Meaningful expression of the FGF21 coreceptor β-Klotho was restricted to liver and WAT in a survey of 15 tissues that included the mammary gland. Expression of β-Klotho and its subset of interacting FGF receptors was modestly affected by the transition from LP to EL in liver but not in WAT.\n\nSerum FGF-21 levels were significantly increased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) which may indicate a role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Elevated levels also correlate with liver fat content in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and positively correlate with BMI in humans suggesting obesity as a FGF21-resistant state.\n\nA single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the FGF21 gene – the FGF21 rs838133 variant – has been identified as a genetic mechanism responsible for the sweet tooth behavioral phenotype, a trait associated with cravings for sweets and high sugar consumption, in both humans and mice.\n\nMice lacking FGF21 fail to fully induce PGC-1α expression in response to a prolonged fast and have impaired gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis.\n\nFGF21 stimulates phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 and ERK1/2 in the liver. Acute FGF21 treatment induced hepatic expression of key regulators of gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, and ketogenesis including glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase, 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase type 1, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α. In addition, injection of FGF21 was associated with decreased circulating insulin and free fatty acid levels. FGF21 treatment induced mRNA and protein expression of PGC-1α, but in mice PGC-1α expression was not necessary for the effect of FGF21 on glucose metabolism.\n\nIn mice FGF21 is strongly induced in liver by prolonged fasting via PPAR-alpha and in turn induces the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α and stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and ketogenesis. FGF21 also blocks somatic growth and sensitizes mice to a hibernation-like state of torpor, playing a key role in eliciting and coordinating the adaptive starvation response. FGF21 expression is also induced in white adipose tissue by PPAR-gamma, which may indicate it also regulates metabolism in the fed state. FGF21 is induced in both rodents and humans consuming a low protein diet. FGF21 expression is also induced by diets with reduced levels of the essential dietary amino acid methionine or with reduced levels of branched-chain amino acids.\n\nActivation of AMPK and SIRT1 by FGF21 in adipocytes enhanced mitochondrial oxidative capacity as demonstrated by increases in oxygen consumption, citrate synthase activity, and induction of key metabolic genes. The effects of FGF21 on mitochondrial function require serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11/LKB1), which activates AMPK. Inhibition of AMPK, SIRT1, and PGC-1α activities attenuated the effects of FGF21 on oxygen consumption and gene expression, indicating that FGF21 regulates mitochondrial activity and enhances oxidative capacity through an LKB1-AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1α-dependent mechanism in adipocytes, resulting in increased phosphorylation of AMPK, increased cellular NAD+ levels and activation of SIRT1 and deacetylation of SIRT1 targets PGC-1α and histone 3.\n\nAcutely, the rise in FGF21 in response to alcohol consumption inhibits further drinking. Chronically, the rise in FGF21 expression in the liver may protect against liver damage.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40537197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40537197", "title": "Ferroptosis", "text": "Ferroptosis\n\nFerroptosis is a type of programmed cell death dependent on iron and characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxides, and is genetically and biochemically distinct from other forms of regulated cell death such as apoptosis. Ferroptosis is initiated by the failure of the glutathione-dependent antioxidant defenses, resulting in unchecked lipid peroxidation and eventual cell death. Lipophilic antioxidants and iron chelators can prevent ferroptotic cell death.\n\nThe accumulation of lipid peroxides that results in the process of ferroptosis makes it peroxidation-driven, meaning it is driven by the oxidative degeneration of lipids. This process of cell death occurs when free radical molecules take electrons from a lipid molecule to cause the degradation of the lipid molecule. This degradation is the result of the lipid molecules being oxidized, meaning losing electrons, to the free radical molecules. This process makes ferroptosis a regulatory form of cell death. The reason the process of oxidative degradation of a lipid drives ferroptosis is because glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a lipid repair enzyme, undergoes a loss of activity. Researchers have identified roles in which ferroptosis can contribute to the medical field such as in aiding in cancer treatments where this form of cell death can be induced in the human body. Ferroptosis activation plays a regulatory role on growth of tumor cells in the human body. However, the positive effects of ferroptosis could be potentially neutralized by its disruption of metabolic pathways and disruption of homeostasis in the human body. Since ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death, some of the molecules that regulate ferroptosis are involved in metabolic pathways that regulate cysteine exploitation, glutathione state, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate function, lipid peroxidation and iron homeostasis.\n\nSmall molecules such as erastin, sulfasalazine, sorafenib, altretamine, RSL-3, ML-162 and ML-210 are known inhibitors of this tumor cell growth and induce ferroptosis. They do not trigger a response of change in apoptosis and therefore have no chromatin margination or cleave poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Instead, the phenotype of the mitochondria is changed using primarily erastin or RSL3. Iron is also a necessity for these activators. They therefore can be inhibited by iron chelators. Ultimately, cell death induced by erastin and RSL-3 in the phenotype is what makes up ferroptosis. Ferroptosis can also be induced by blocking the enzyme GPX4. Triggering ferroptosis is also caused by inhibiting GSH, which is necessary for the function of GPX4, and ultimately inducing a ferroptotic response in a cell.\n\nAnother form of cell death that occurs in the nervous system is apoptosis. Named after the Greek word meaning “to fall away from”, apoptosis results in cell breakage into small, apoptotic bodies taken up through phagocytosis. This process occurs continuously within mammalian nervous system processes that begin at fetal development and continue through adult life. Apoptotic death is crucial for the correct population size of neuronal and glial cells. Similarly to ferroptosis, deficiencies in apoptotic processes can result in many health complications, including neurodegeneration.\n\nWithin the study of neuronal apoptosis, most research has been conducted on the neurons of the superior cervical ganglion. In order for these neurons to survive and innervate their target tissues, they must have nerve growth factor (NGF). Normally, NGF binds to a tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkA, which activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Raf-MEK-ERK) signaling pathways. This occurs during normal development which promotes neuronal growth in the sympathetic nervous system.\n\nDuring embryonic development, the absence of NGF activates apoptosis by decreasing the activity of the signaling pathways normally activated by NGF. this pathway of apoptosis has also been named the intrinsic pathway, as it is activated by intrinsic factors over external factors. Without NGF, the neurons of the sympathetic nervous system begin to atrophy, glucose uptake rates fall and the rates of protein synthesis and gene expression slow. Apoptotic death from NGF withdrawal also requires caspase activity. Upon NGF withdrawal, caspase-3 activation occurs through an in-vitro pathway beginning with the release of Cytochrome c from the mitochondria. In a surviving sympathetic neuron, the overexpression of anti-apoptotic B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) proteins prevents NGF withdrawal-induced death. However, overexpression of a separate, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene, Bax, stimulates the release of Cytochrome c2. Cytochrome c promotes the activation of caspase-9 through the formation of the apoptosome. Once caspase-9 is activated, it can cleave and activate caspase-3 resulting in cell death. Notably, apoptosis does not release intracellular fluid as neurons that are degraded though ferroptosis do. During ferroptosis, neurons release lipid metabolites from inside the cell body. This is a key difference between ferroptosis and apoptosis.\n\nNeural connections are constantly changing within the nervous system. Synaptic connections that are used more often are kept intact and promoted, while synaptic connections that are rarely used are subject to degradation. Elevated levels of synaptic connection loss and degradation of neurons are linked to neurodegenerative diseases. More recently, ferroptosis has been linked to these neurodegenerative diseases. Two new studies show that ferroptosis contributes to neuronal death after intracerebral hemorrhage. Neurons that are degraded through ferroptosis release lipid metabolites from inside the cell body. The lipid metabolites are harmful to surrounding neurons, causing inflammation in the brain. Inflammation is a pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease and intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\nIn a study performed using mice it was found that absence of a certain enzyme, glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4), enhanced activity of ferroptosis. Foods high in Vitamin E promote Gpx4 activity, consequently inhibiting ferroptosis and preventing inflammation in brain regions. In the experimental group of mice that were manipulated to have decreased Gpx4 levels, mice were observed to have cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration of hippocampal neurons, again linking ferroptosis to neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nSimilarly, presence of transcription factors, specifically ATF-4, can determine how readily a neuron can undergo cell death. The presence of ATF-4 promotes resistance in cells against ferroptosis. However, this resistance can cause other diseases, such as cancer, to progress and become malignant. While ATF-4 provides resistance ferroptosis, an abundance of ATF-4 causes neurodegeneration.\n\nFerroptosis is a more controlled form of programmed cell death. With small molecules inducing ferroptosis, it inhibits tumor growth and increases drug resistance. It is still unknown the exact mechanism in which ferroptosis inhibits tumor growth, but based on early experiments, it could be used to treat tumor cells and ultimately cancer.\nBased on the figure shown, initiating ferroptosis can be done by eliminating GPX4 activity through Xc- (erastin mediated). The inhibition or degradation of GPX4 by erastin or RSL3 has been noticed to be the primary mechanism that will trigger ferroptosis. Since ferroptosis is an iron dependent mechanism, an accumulation of lipid ROS kills the cells that have begun to undergo ferroptosis and eliminates them completely.\n\nFerroptosis can be used to treat several different types of cancer, each seemingly different forms of the disease. This method of cell death has been tested either in mice, or is in the early stages of research and has not yet been fully tested. This includes cancer types such as:\n\n\nThese forms of cancer have been hypothesized to be highly sensitive to ferroptosis, or react to erastin or Xc- in a way that minimizes the tumor cells or responds to this treatment with a result of cell death. An upregulation of iron levels has also been seen to induce ferroptosis in certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer. Breast cancer cells have exhibited vulnerability to ferroptosis via a combination of siramesine and lapatinib. These cells also exhibited an autophagic cycle independent of ferroptotic activity, indicating that the two different forms of cell death could be controlled to activate at specific times following treatment.\n\n"}

MacAllister was best known for her burlesque work, performing on stage as Reva Lucian, a play on 'revolution', and Ms. Demeanor.\n\nSuffering from ovarian cancer, Heather MacAllister moved from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon in June 2006. Her partner, author and stand-up comedian Kelli Dunham, moved from the East Coast to care for her until her death by assisted suicide in February 2007.\n\nTina Palivos described her friend:\n\nThe spirit of Heather was really about three things: loving yourself and taking care of self and others; social justice in whatever form; and she was a performer and artist. She was glamorous, an extraordinary performer and stunningly beautiful.\nHeather MacAllister was born in Michigan on the February 25, 1968, and grew up in Dearborn and Ann Arbor, Michigan. She also lived in Tucson, Arizona. MacAllister moved from Detroit to San Francisco in 2002 and to Portland, Oregon, in 2006.\n\nMacAllister earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology and African American studies from Eastern Michigan University in 1998.\n\nHeather MacAllister died on February 13, 2007, at age 38 as a result of an assisted suicide. Her death came after a three-year battle with terminal ovarian cancer. Memorial services were held in Portland, Detroit, New York and San Francisco.\n\nDuring a lifetime of art and activism Heather MacAllister was involved in a range of social justice issues, particularly LGBT rights, anti-racism and addressing anti-fat bias. Her tours as a fat burlesque performer challenged both those within and outside the fat acceptance movement on the notion of The Thin Ideal as a pre-requisquite for sexual attractiveness. Six years after her death, friend Stacy Bias recalls MacAllister's approach to activism: \n\n\"Heather had an ability to perceive others in a powerful way - such that she could spend an hour chatting with someone and then deliver a simple sentence that had the ability to transform their lives in a small but memorable way. In the case of many, that transforming power was much larger... She had a passion for community and activism that, in some ways, transcended the individual (in ways that the individual sometimes found uncomfortable) in favor of the vision.\" \nWhilst she was living in Michigan, Heather MacAllister's fat activism included the 1992 founding of the Venus Group, a social and support network for large women. She also contributed to Fat Girl zine in the early 1990s and lobbied for the weight discrimination act that was passed in San Francisco in 2000. MacAllister was on the board of NoLose, an organization for fat lesbians.\n\nMacAllister founded Big Burlesque and the Fat-Bottom Revue, the world's first all-fat burlesque performance group of which she was also the artistic director. She argued that erotic performance allowed fat women to express a sexuality \"which has been underaffirmed and made negative in the popular culture.\" Her stage names were Ms. Demeanor and Reva Lucian (a play on the word \"revolution\"). MacAllister toured both size acceptance workshops and burlesque performances nationwide. Venues at which she appeared or conducted workshops included the True Spirit Conference in Washington, D.C., the National Women's Music Festival in Indiana, the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, Eastern Michigan University, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, the Abundia Retreat in Illinois, the NoLose Conference in New Jersey, Fat Girl Speaks in Oregon, the Tease-o-Rama burlesque convention, and Burning Man in Nevada. Heather MacAllister described her belief in burlesque as activism: \"Any time there is a fat person onstage as anything besides the butt of a joke, it’s political. Add physical movement, then dance, then sexuality and you have a revolutionary act.\" \n\nIn 2006 Heather MacAllister received the Queer Cultural Activist Award from the Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club.\n\nMacAllister appeared posthumously in the art photography book \"The Full Body Project\" by photographer and actor Leonard Nimoy (of \"Star Trek\" fame). The book is a compilation of photographs including those taken of MacAllister and her troupe for a 2005 New York City art photography show called \"Maximum Beauty\" which opened at the Bonni Benrubi gallery on 57th street in New York City. The book was released in 2007 and dedicated to Heather MacAllister. Before her death she had requested that mourners made donations to her Fat Fashion Scholarship Fund. MacAllister also contributed a chapter to \"The Fat Studies Reader\" entitled 'Embodying Fat Liberation' that was posthumously published in 2009.\n\nIn the late 1990s Heather MacAllister was the director of the LGBT resource center at the Eastern University of Michigan.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2002, MacAllister worked as a field organizer for the Triangle Foundation, a gay rights group in Michigan.

It starred Charles Dance, Cassie Stuart, Richard E. Grant and Bill Paterson, and was Poliakoff's directorial debut. It had a limited theatrical release in 1988, before being shown in Channel 4's \"Film on Four\" strand on 9 May 1989 (postponed from 9 March 1989).\n\nInfuriated by receiving the wrong piece of film, statistician James Richards (Dance) arranges for the researcher who made the mistake, Sharon Newton (Stuart), to be sacked. When she realises that he is responsible, Sharon contacts James and demands his help. She has obtained a mysterious piece of film which, while superficially a collection of street scenes, seems to show the abduction of a woman. The film abruptly cuts off, instructing the viewer to see \"The Hedgerows of England\". As this film has been registered classified by the Ministry of Defence, Sharon, obsessed by the identity of the woman, needs James, with his official credentials, to help her find it.\n\nJames tracks down the location of the film, but a visit to an old tram depot and an archive beneath Oxford Street proves frustrating, as the film has now been moved. He and Sharon chase it to a landfill site, where they notice a police presence, and then to the incinerator at Edmonton, where they manage to rescue it before it is burned. But upon viewing the film, they find that it is very poor quality, revealing only a dark image of a woman in front of some kind of tribunal. A card at the end tells them that the next film to look for is called \"Hop-Picking in Kent\". James is not entirely unhappy to find his comfortable life disrupted by the search for the film, and wakes up, after a drunken evening spent at a video duplication service, at Sharon's house, where he discovers that she has a young daughter. Needing to go out to work, she leaves her daughter with James.\n\nTaking the baby out to meet his ex-wife, James is cornered by two officials, who beat him up and demand to know the whereabouts of something he has found. Shaken, he goes to see his City friend Anthony (Paterson), who advises him to go home and forget about it. But Anthony also drops a hint that he too has been questioned, and James realises that he is in serious danger. Returning to his house, he finds it has been searched and realises that the officials want some medical records which he idly picked up from the landfill site. After an unexpected encounter with them, James manages to escape and is reunited with a distressed Sharon, who has been worried about her daughter.\n\nMeanwhile, a friend of Sharon's does some illicit searching for her in the archives and discovers the film \"Hop-Picking In Kent\". Within the bland information film is a full version of the mysterious film, featuring a different woman along with a man. Some kind of emergency has occurred and left the participants dead. Moving forward in time, the film documents the birth of an abruptly aborted government project named Magnificat. The women from the original film then reappears, sitting in a location which James recognises: an official building which has re-opened as a café. The film ends with the woman reunited with a horribly scarred man and confronting the cameraman, asking why he is filming. James suggests that this was the result of an accident with nuclear power which has been hushed up and that the café was once a secure convalescent unit. He also wonders why the film was made in the first place. James and Sharon decide to keep the film secret and he throws the offending medical records into a bin. Meanwhile, somewhere in London, a cleaner has her break in an isolated room where the remnants of Project Magnificat are still stored.\n\n"}
{"id": "66496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66496", "title": "Hippogriff", "text": "Hippogriff\n\nThe hippogriff, or sometimes spelled hippogryph (), is a legendary creature which has the front half of an eagle and the hind half of a horse.\n\nThe first recorded mention of the hippogriff was made by the Latin poet Virgil in his \"Eclogues\". Though sometimes depicted during the Classical Era and during the rule of the Merovingians, it was used by Ludovico Ariosto in his \"Orlando Furioso\", at the beginning of the 16th century. Within the poem, the hippogriff is a steed born of a mare and a griffin—it is extremely fast and is presented as being able to fly around the world and to the Moon. It is ridden by magicians and the wandering knight Ruggiero, who, from the creature’s back, frees the beautiful Angelica.\n\nSometimes depicted on coats of arms, the hippogriff became a subject of visual art in the 19th century, when it was often drawn by Gustave Doré.\n\nThe word \"hippogriff\", also spelled \"hippogryph\", is derived from the , meaning \"horse\", and the Italian \"grifo\" meaning \"griffin\" (from Latin \"gryp\" or \"gryphus\"), which denotes another mythical creature, with the head of an eagle and body of a lion, that is purported to be the father of the hippogriff. The word \"hippogriff\" was adopted into English shortly before 1615.\n\nThe hippogriff is a symbol of the Greek god Apollo, either through his connection to the Muses or as god of the sun. Buonarotti is stated to have believed that the worship of Apollo, and with him the symbol of the hippogriff, came to the Greeks from cultures to the east.\n\nOf the heraldic representations of the hippogriff, Arthur Charles Fox-Davies states that hybrid fantastical creatures' depictions are \"ugly, inartistic, and unnecessary. Their representation leaves one with a disappointed feeling of crudity of draughtsmanship.\" John Vinycomb states that the hippogriff is not used in the British heraldic tradition.\n\nLudovico Ariosto's poem, \"Orlando furioso\" (1516) contains description (canto IV):\n\nAccording to Thomas Bulfinch's \"Legends of Charlemagne\":\n\nAccording to Vidal, a Spanish historian, this creature was supposed to live near Céret, in the County of Roussillon of modern-day France, during the Middle Ages. Claw marks were found on a rock near Mas Carol. The belief in the existence of the hippogriff, such as Ariosto describes, is fiercely attacked in a scientific essay on religion in 1862, which argues that such an animal can neither be a divine creation, nor truly exist. The Book of Enoch quite clearly details how Satan and his fallen angels created various hybrids by admixture. The Sphinx is the most well known such hybrid. The hippogriff is supposed to be a mixture of several animals and the author notes that in order to support its weight, the wings would be so heavy that flight would be impossible, which proves—without question—that it does not exist.\n\nIn some traditions, the hippogriff is said to be the symbol of love, as its parents, the mare and griffin, are natural enemies. In other traditions, the hippogriff represents Christ's dual nature as both human and divine.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the first to use the term arboretum in writing to refer to a garden of plants, especially trees, collected for the purpose of scientific study.\n\nLoudon was born in Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, Scotland to a respectable farmer. Therefore, as he was growing up, he developed a practical knowledge of plants and farming. As a young man, Loudon studied biology, botany and agriculture at the University of Edinburgh. When working on the layout of farms in South Scotland, he described himself as a landscape planner. This was a time when open field land was being converted from run rig with 'ferm touns' to the landscape of enclosure, which now dominates British agriculture.\n\nLoudon developed a limp as a young man, and later became crippled with arthritis. He undertook a second Grand Tour of Europe and also visited the Near East. In 1826, crippled by rheumatism and arthritis, he had to endure an amputation at his right shoulder after a botched operation to correct a broken arm. He learnt to write and draw with his left arm and hired a draughtsman to prepare his plans. At the same time he cured himself of an opium habit that had been keeping the pain at bay.\n\nDesign of the municipal cemetery at Southampton was Loudon's final project. Despite advanced lung cancer, he corrected the final proofs for his latest encyclopaedia. He travelled to Bath to inspect the site for another cemetery; and then to Oxford to see a client. On his return to London, his doctor told him that he was dying; he died, penniless, in the arms of his wife in December 1843. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.\n\nIn 1830, when Loudon was 47 years old, he asked a friend to invite the author of \"\" to lunch. He had recently reviewed and admired the inventions in this novel in an article published in his \"Gardener's Magazine\". Set in 2126 AD, it is an early example of science fiction. England has become an absolute monarchy and it features an early Internet, espresso machines, and air-conditioning. The author was Jane Webb who, having been left penniless at 17 by the death of her father, had turned to writing as a profession. She had published the book anonymously. They married seven months later and had a daughter, Agnes.\n\nLoudon loved the fantastical and his wife's expression of it. Their marriage not only symbolized a mutual admiration of one another's minds, but a number of innovations in the world of gardening. Throughout their marriage, Jane Loudon encountered her husband's work and decided to create her own guides to make gardening more accessible to young women. The Loudons were considered the leading horticulturalists of their day, and their circle of friends included Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray.\n\nAround 1803, Loudon published an article entitled \"Observations on Laying out the Public Spaces in London\". It recommended the introduction of lighter trees rather than those with dense canopies. Loudon was attacked by rheumatic fever in 1806 which left him crippled, but this illness did not affect his writing. As his condition deteriorated over time, Loudon was forced to use the services of a draughtsman and other aids.\n\nBeginning in 1808, Loudon was employed by George Frederick Stratton to landscape and farm his property, Tew Park, where he was able to set up a school for young men to be instructed in theory of farming and modes of cultivating the soil. Loudon's design was a model of efficiency and convenience reflected in elegance and refinement. In conjunction with the goals of diffusing agricultural knowledge, Loudon published a pamphlet entitled \"The Utility of Agricultural Knowledge to the Sons of the Landed Proprietors of Great Britain, &c., by a Scotch Farmer and Land-Agent.\"\n\nAfter travelling through Europe from 1813 to 1814, Loudon began to focus on the improvement of the construction of greenhouses and other agricultural systems. He ultimately developed a design for hinged surfaces that could be adjusted depending on the angle of the sun. Loudon also developed plans for industrial worker housing and solar heating systems. In 1815, he was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nLoudon established himself as a city planner, decades before Frederick Law Olmsted and others began to work. His vision for the possibility of long term planning for London's green spaces was illustrated within his work, \"Hints for Breathing Places for Metropolis\" published in 1829. He envisioned city growth being carefully shaped and circulation influenced by the inclusion of green belts.\n\nIn 1832, Loudon established the design theory entitled \"Gardenesque\". In this style, attention was given to the individual plant and placement in the best conditions for them to grow to their potential. 19th century thought was punctuated by the belief that gardens should not mimic nature, so \"Gardenesque\" offered a solution by introducing exotics into gardens and basing layouts on abstract shapes.\n\nLoudon was instrumental in the adoption of the term \"landscape architecture\" by the modern profession. He took up the term from Gilbert Laing Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the \"Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton\".\n\nLoudon was a prolific horticultural and landscape design writer. Through his publications, he hoped to spread his ideals of the creation of common space and the improvement of city planning and develop an awareness and interest in agriculture and horticulture. Through his magazines and works, he was able to communicate with lay folk as well as other professionals.\n\nHe wrote \"An Encyclopædia of Gardening\" in 1822. After its success Loudon published \"The Encyclopedia of Agriculture\" in 1825. He founded the \"Gardener's Magazine\", the first periodical devoted solely to horticulture, in 1826. A short time later, he commenced the \"Magazine of Natural History\" in 1828.\n\nPerhaps the most significant of these, certainly the most time-consuming and costly, was \"Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum\". This work was published in three formats: with the plates entirely uncoloured, with botanical details hand-coloured, and fully hand-coloured. Work began in 1830 and it was first issued in sixty-three monthly parts from January 1835 to July 1838. It presented: an exhaustive account of all the trees and shrubs growing in Great Britain and their history; notes on remarkable examples growing in individual gardens; drawings of leaves, twigs, fruits, and the shapes of leafless trees; and entire portraits of trees in their young and mature state. All were drawn from life, many being from the parkland grounds of Syon House, one of the homes of the Duke of Northumberland to whom the work was dedicated, or from Loddiges' arboretum. \"It was on the collection maintained by this firm more than any other that J. C. Loudon relied for living material in the preparation of his great work\" W. J. Bean notes, in \"Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles\". The publication also ruined him financially, as he ended up with many unsold copies of the eight-volume work and went deep into debt.\nHis work on cemeteries also was significant. Churchyards were becoming full, especially in urban areas, and new cemeteries were being opened by private enterprises. Loudon designed only three cemeteries (Bath Abbey Cemetery, Histon Road Cemetery, Cambridge, and Southampton Old Cemetery where the design was rejected) but his writing was a major influence on other designers and architects of the period.\n\nAn unusual creation by Loudon is the memorial to his parents, which stands in the grounds of St John the Baptist, Pinner's parish church. It is in the form of a stone wedge, with a fake stone sarcophagus within. It has been Grade II listed since 1983.\n\nLoudon thought that public improvements should be undertaken in a democratic fashion and in a comprehensive and reasonable manner, not sporadically by the benevolence of the wealthy. In 1839, he was commissioned to design the Arboretum at Derby. In his commissions, Loudon displayed the principles that he advocated in his writings; he took into account the general public, aiming to create a space where the classes could mingle easily as well as creating community pride. Plantings were labelled extensively. Loudon's design for the Derby Arboretum paralleled the Loddiges arboretum at Abney Park and served as inspiration for the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew.\n\n\nDesigned by others in Loudon's 'Gardenesque' style:\n\nLoudon's publications include the books:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3442100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3442100", "title": "Key person insurance", "text": "Key person insurance\n\nKey person insurance, also commonly called keyman insurance and key man insurance or 'key employee insurance', is an important form of business insurance. There is no legal definition of \"key person insurance\". In general, it can be described as an insurance policy taken out by a business to compensate that business for financial losses that would arise from the death or extended incapacity of an important member of the business. To put it simply, key person insurance is a standard life insurance or trauma insurance policy that is used for business succession or business protection purposes. The policy's term does not extend beyond the period of the key person’s usefulness to the business. Key person policies are usually owned by the business and the aim is to compensate the business for losses incurred with the loss of a key income generator and facilitate business continuity. Key person insurance does not indemnify the actual losses incurred but compensates with a fixed monetary sum as specified in the insurance policy.\n\nMany businesses have a key person who is responsible for the majority of profits or has a unique and hard to replace skill set such as Intellectual Property that is vital to the organisation. An employer may take out a key person insurance policy on the life or health of any employee whose knowledge, work, or overall contribution is considered uniquely valuable to the company. The employer does this to offset the costs (such as hiring temporary help or recruiting a successor) and losses (such as a decreased ability to transact business until successors are trained) which the employer is likely to suffer in the event of the loss of a key person.\n\nThere are four categories of loss for which key person insurance can provide compensation:\n\n\nKey people are individuals whose skills, knowledge, experience or leadership are important to a business’ continued financial success. Should something happen to one of these individuals it is likely that their loss will have a detrimental impact on the profitability of the business and will cause financial strain. Examples of a key individual include, but are not limited to: company directors, sales directors, IT specialist, managing directors and heads of product development.\n\nDeciding on the sum of money to ensure the key person is dependent on the company and the reason for insuring that individual. It can be to cover a loan or investment amount, or it can be dependent on working out the worth of the person to the company. It is recommended that you think about potential loss of profits, the cost of replacement and any debts that would need to be covered to keep the company running without that person.\n\nLoss of profits can be caused as a result of the loss of company reputation, the loss of clients or a decline in sales. For example, if a key sales manager had built up a relationship with key clients, they may no longer want to work with the business if that key person were no longer around. This can cause them to go elsewhere and cause a dip in sales figures. In addition to this, the cost of training, recruitment and temporary cover to find a replacement can be high. This also needs to be factored into the amount of cover that is taken out. The company would need to consider how they would be impacted as a result of a loss of a key person in different ways to determine how much that individual is worth.\n\nKey person insurance policies can be owned in a number of ways depending on the needs of the business. It is common for a business to own the policy with claim proceeds being paid directly to the business. There is no legislative or insurable requirement for a policy to be owned by a specific party or entity and there may be circumstances be it for taxation or policy continuation purposes where policies may be owned and paid for by the insured person directly or owned by another individual.\n\n\n\nThe tax treatment for premiums paid for key person insurance and the treatment of monies received from a claim vary among countries.\n\nPremiums are generally not tax deductible in the U.S. Under the COLI Best Practices Act within the Pension Protection Act of 2006, key person insurance proceeds for policies owned by employers can be taxable if certain conditions are not met.\n\nIn Australia, Key person insurance policies are generally not deductible unless used specifically for business revenue protection purposes. Claim proceeds in Australia if used for revenue purposes may be taxable and depending on the ownership of the policy, may trigger a Capital Gains Taxation Event. In the UK the main principles of key person insurance taxation were outlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1944, Sir John Anderson. The \"Andersen Rules\" state \"Treatment for taxation purposes would depend upon the facts of the particular case and it rests with the assessing authorities and the Commissioners on appeal, if necessary, to determine the liability by reference to these facts. I am, however, advised that the general practice in dealing with insurances on the lives of employees is to treat the premiums as admissible deductions, and any sums received under a policy as trading receipts, if (i) the sole relationship is that of employer and employee; (ii) the insurance is intended to meet loss of profit resulting from the loss of services of the employee; and (iii) it is an annual or short-term insurance. Cases of premiums paid by companies to insure the lives of Directors are dealt with on similar lines.\"\n\nUK taxation for key man insurance is normally taken from the guidance set out by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1944. In answer to a parliamentary question Sir John Anderson made the following statement:\n“Treatment for taxation purposes would depend upon the facts of the particular case and it rests with the assessing authorities and the Commissioners on appeal, if necessary, to determine the liability by reference to these facts. I am, however, advised that the general practice in dealing with insurances on the lives of employees is to treat the premiums as admissible deductions, and any sums received under a policy as trading receipts, if (i) the sole relationship is that of employer and employee; (ii) the insurance is intended to meet loss of profit resulting from the loss of services of the employee; and (iii) it is an annual or short-term insurance. Cases of premiums paid by companies to insure the lives of Directors are dealt with on similar lines.” \n\nThe UK tax office, HMRC, has the view that key man insurance is tax-efficient if it is taken out 'solely for the purposes of the business'. Specifically, if the company takes out a key man insurance policy to protect the business from any loss of profits that have stemmed from the loss of the employee, then the premiums are not taxable. If a key employee has a substantial number of shares, then the key man insurance could potentially be seen as being taken out for their own interests, instead of the business. This is particularly the case if critical illness cover is added to the policy. Essentially, key man insurance can be tax-efficient, but it is always best to check with a financial advisor or the local tax office before making assumptions. \n"}

He served as commander of the Fourth Army of the Republic of China, governor of Guangdong, military affairs commissioner, and acting president of the Whampoa Military Academy. After opposing Chiang Kai-shek and being expelled from the Kuomintang in 1947, he became one of the six Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China with that government's founding on October 1, 1949.\n\nLi was born into a scholar-gentry family in Cangwu County, Wuzhou, Guangxi in 1886. His mother died when he was four years old. In 1903, Li enrolled at Wuzhou Middle School, where he studied under the right wing Kuomintang leader Hu Hanmin. In 1904, he transferred to the Liangguang Military Middle School in Guangdong, and three years later was selected for advanced study at the Officers Military Academy in Beijing. He interrupted his studies after the Wuchang revolt of October 1911 to serve as chief of staff of the 22nd division of the revolutionary army in Jiangsu. After the establishment of the Republic of China, Li completed his education and remained at the academy, now called the Military Staff College.\n\nLi returned to Guangdong in 1921 at the invitation of Guangdong Army chief of staff Deng Keng. Deng was assassinated in March 1922, and Chen Jiongming staged a coup in June of that year, which Li helped to put down. For this, he received command of the army's 1st Division.\n\nIn 1924, after serving briefly as commissioner of reconstruction of the West River-Wuzhou area and as Wuzhou garrison commandor, Li became deputy dean of the newly established Whampoa Military Academy under Chiang Kai-shek. After Sun Yat-sen's death in March 1925, the Guangdong government was reorganized as the National Government, and Li was appointed commander of the Fourth Army, which had formerly been the Guangdong Army. He spent the next year destroying Chen Jiongming's remaining power.\n\nWhen the Northern Expedition began in July 1926, Li's Fourth Army joined the push northward. During this time, Li also served as governor of Guangdong, military affairs commissioner, and acting president of the Whampoa Military Academy. In 1927, he was elected to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. In November 1927, Li left Guangdong with Wang Jingwei to attend a plenary session of the Committee in Shanghai on the subject of restoring party unity. In his absence, Zhang Fakui staged a coup. Forces loyal to Li forced Zhang to surrender, and Li returned to Guangdong on 4 January 1928. \n\nOn 7 February 1928, Li was made a member of the standing committee of the Military Affairs Commission. He was also made commander in chief of the newly established Eighth Route Army. On 1 March, Li became chairman of the Guangdong branch political council of the Kuomintang, and on 30 March he was made chief of the general staff of the Northern Expedition. During the remainder of the year, Li attended meetings in Beijing, and briefly served as acting commander in chief of the Nationalist forces when Chiang Kai-shek left Beijing for Nanjing. He was appointed to the State Council on 8 October and resigned as governor of Guangdong in November.\n\nIn 1929, Li traveled to Nanjing to attend the Third National Congress and mediate a dispute that had arisen between the Nationalist government and the New Guangxi clique. However, talks broke down in March, the members of the clique were expelled from the Kuomintang, and Li was placed in detention. He was not freed until after the Japanese attack on Mukden in 1931.\n\nLi did not have significant political power until 1933, when he joined with Chen Mingshu to launch a revolt in Fujian. Li was made chairman of the people's revolutionary government at Fuzhou, but the revolt was quickly suppressed, and Li was forced to flee to Hong Kong in January 1934. \n\nIn 1935, Li joined with associates to found the Chinese People's Revolutionary League, which advocated resistance against Japan and overthrow of the Nationalist government. In 1936, Li participated in a joint Guangdong-Guangxi revolt against the government, but after it collapsed, Li returned to Hong Kong. The order for his arrest was rescinded.\n\nIn 1938, Li was restored to membership in the Kuomintang, and again became a member of the Military Affairs Commission and the State Council. During the Sino-Japanese War, Li served in several military posts. In 1944, he was appointed president of the Military Advisory Council, but instead worked to consolidate resistance against Japan in southern Guangxi. At the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang in May 1945, Li was elected to the Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang, and served as a delegate to the National Assembly the following year.\n\nOn 8 March 1947, Li issued a statement calling for reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party. For this, he was again expelled from the Kuomintang for making unwarranted statements and inciting the people to riot. Li began working to unite current and former Kuomintang members who opposed National government policies. This led to the formation of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang in 1948, with Li as its first chairman.\n\nLi left Hong Kong in early 1949 and traveled north to Beiping, where he assisted in the preparatory work for the founding of the People's Republic of China. After the inauguration of the new government, Li became one of its six vice-chairmen, as well as Vice-President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. In January 1953, Li became a member of the committee assigned to draft the first constitution of the People's Republic. He served as a delegate to the National People's Congress (NPC) in 1954. The new constitution reduced the number of vice-chairmen from six to two, so Li gave up his post and became a vice Vice Chair of the NPC Standing Committee. Li continued to hold posts in the government until his death on 9 October 1959 in Beijing due to stomach cancer and a cerebral thrombosis.\n\nLi married several times and had many children. One of his sons became dean of the agricultural college of Lingnan University during the 1940s. Another son, Li Peiyao, became Chairman of the National Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang in the 1990s. Three of his daughters were students at Yenching University in 1950.\n"}

{"id": "30936238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30936238", "title": "List of nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll", "text": "List of nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll\n\nThere have been several nuclear and radiation accidents involving fatalities, including nuclear power plant accidents, nuclear submarine accidents, and radiotherapy incidents.\n\nEstimates of the total number of deaths potentially resulting from the Chernobyl disaster vary enormously: A UNSCEAR report proposes 45 total confirmed deaths from the accident . This number includes 2 non-radiation related fatalities from the accident itself, 28 fatalities from radiation doses in the immediate following months and 15 fatalities due to thyroid cancer likely caused by iodine-131 contamination; it does not include 19 additional individuals initially diagnosed with acute radiation syndrome who had also died , but who are not believed to have died due to radiation doses. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggested in 2006 that cancer deaths could reach 4,000 among the 600,000 most heavily exposed people, a group which includes emergency workers, nearby residents, and evacuees, but excludes residents of low-contaminated areas. A 2006 report, commissioned by The Greens and sponsored by the Altner Combecher Foundation, predicted 30,000 to 60,000 cancer deaths as a result of worldwide Chernobyl fallout by assuming a linear no-threshold model for very low doses. A Greenpeace report puts this figure at 200,000 or more. A disputed Russian publication, , concludes that 985,000 premature deaths occurred worldwide between 1986 and 2004 as a result of radioactive contamination from Chernobyl.\n\nThe Kyshtym disaster, which occurred at Mayak in Russia on 29 September 1957, was rated as a level 6 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the third most severe incident after Chernobyl and Fukushima. Because of the intense secrecy surrounding Mayak, it is difficult to estimate the death toll of Kyshtym. One book claims that \"in 1992, a study conducted by the Institute of Biophysics at the former Soviet Health Ministry in Chelyabinsk found that 8,015 people had died within the preceding 32 years as a result of the accident.\" By contrast, only 6,000 death certificates have been found for residents of the Tech riverside between 1950 and 1982 from all causes of death, though perhaps the Soviet study considered a larger geographic area affected by the airborne plume. The most commonly quoted estimate is 200 deaths due to cancer, but the origin of this number is not clear. More recent epidemiological studies suggest that around 49 to 55 cancer deaths among riverside residents can be associated to radiation exposure. This would include the effects of all radioactive releases into the river, 98% of which happened long before the 1957 accident, but it would not include the effects of the airborne plume that was carried north-east. The area closest to the accident produced 66 diagnosed cases of chronic radiation syndrome, providing the bulk of the data about this condition.\n\nAt least 33 cancer fatalities (estimated by UK government) in Windscale, United Kingdom, on October 8, 1957. The Windscale fire resulted when uranium metal fuel ignited inside plutonium production piles; surrounding dairy farms were contaminated.\n\nIn a 2013 report, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) stated the overall health risks from the Fukushima disaster to be far lower than those of Chernobyl. There have been no observed or expected deterministic effects. In pregnancies, there has been no expected increase in spontaneous abortions, miscarriages, perinatal mortality, birth defects, or cognitive impairment. Finally, there was no expected discernible increase in heritable disease or discernible radiation-related increases in any cancers, with the possible exception of thyroid cancer. However, the high detection rates of thyroid nodules, cysts, and cancer may be a consequence of intensive screening. In a 2015 white paper, UNSCEAR stated its findings from 2013 remain valid and largely unaffected by new information, and the new information further supports the statement that high thyroid detection is likely due to more intensive screening.\n\nNone of the workers at the Fukushima Daiichi site have died from acute radiation poisoning, though six workers died due to various reasons, including cardiovascular disease, during the containment efforts or work to stabilize the earthquake and tsunami damage to the site.\n\nIn contrast, an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal cites a 2013 Japanese study, which concluded that mortality due to \"evacuation stress\" from the area around Fukushima had reached more than 1600. This includes deaths from suicide and lack of access to critical health care, but not from radiation, increased cancer, or any other direct result of the nuclear accident. The author also states these deaths occurred among people who had been evacuated from areas where the radiation posed little or no risk to their health, areas where they would experience less exposure than the normal amount received by residents in Finland.\n\nThere is a class action lawsuit brought by sailors on the USS Reagan against Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) who are allegedly suffering severe radiation induced illnesses. The USS Reagan was part of the operation \"Tomodachi\" to deliver essential supplies to devastated communities in the wake of the Tsunami on March 11, 2011. The wind was blowing out to sea from the Fukushima accident. If it had been blowing west instead of east, the sailors might not have been affected.\n\n"}
{"id": "1127291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1127291", "title": "Murder of Junko Furuta", "text": "Murder of Junko Furuta\n\nJunko Furuta ( \"Furuta Junko\") was a Japanese high-school student who was abducted, tortured, raped, and murdered in the late 1980s. Her murder case was named , due to her body being discovered in a concrete drum. The murder was mainly perpetrated by four teenage boys, Hiroshi Miyano (now Hiroshi Yokoyama), Jō Ogura (now Jō Kamisaku), Shinji Minato, and Yasushi Watanabe.\n\nApproximately 100 people knew about Junko Furuta's captivity, but either did nothing about it or themselves participated in the torture and murder. Most of the participants were friends of the teenage boys, who were low-ranking members of the Yakuza.\n\nJunko Furuta was born in Misato, Saitama Prefecture. As a teenager, she attended Yashio-Minami High School and worked as a part-time employee during after school hours. She was known to be popular and good looking, which made some of her classmates envious. However, she was looked down upon by the \"gangster-like\" teenagers since she refrained from smoking, drinking alcohol and drug usage. Hiroshi Miyano (now Hiroshi Yokoyama), a known school bully with connections to the Yakuza, had a crush on Furuta but she turned him down since she was not looking for a relationship. With the exception of Furuta, nobody dared to oppose Miyano due to his Yakuza connections.\n\nOn 25 November 1988, Miyano and his friend Nobuharu Minato (now Shinji Minato) wandered around Misato, with the intention of robbing and raping local women. At 8:30 pm, they spotted Furuta cycling home after she finished her part-time job. Under Miyano's orders, Minato kicked Furuta off her bicycle and immediately fled the scene. Miyano, pretending to be an innocent bystander, approached Furuta and offered to walk her home safely. Gaining her trust, Furuta was unaware that Miyano was leading her to a nearby warehouse, where he revealed his Yakuza connections. Miyano threatened to kill her as he raped her in the warehouse and once again in a nearby hotel. From the hotel, Miyano called Minato and his other friends, Jō Ogura (now Jō Kamisaku) and Yasushi Watanabe, and bragged to them about the rape. Ogura reportedly asked Miyano to keep her, so that they could all have a turn. The group had a history of gang rape, and had recently kidnapped and raped another girl, although she was released afterward.\n\nAround 3:00 am, Miyano took Furuta to a nearby park, where Minato, Ogura, and Watanabe were waiting. They told her that they knew where she lived (from a notebook in her backpack) and that the Yakuza would kill her family if she attempted to escape. She was easily overpowered by the four boys, and taken to a house in the Ayase district of Adachi, where she was gang-raped. The house was owned by Minato's parents, which soon became their regular gang hangout.\n\nOn 27 November, Furuta's parents contacted the police about their daughter's disappearance. In order to forestall the manhunt, the kidnappers coerced her into calling her mother. She was forced to say that she had run away, but was safe and staying with a friend. She was also forced to ask her mother to stop the police investigation into her disappearance. When Minato's parents were around, Furuta was forced to pose as the girlfriend of one of the kidnappers. They later dropped this pretext when it became clear that the Minatos would not report them to the police. The Minatos stated that they did not intervene because they were aware of Miyano's Yakuza connections and feared retaliation and because their own son was increasingly violent towards them. Minato's brother was also aware of the situation, but also did nothing to prevent it.\n\nFuruta was held captive in the Minato residence for forty days, where she was abused, raped and tortured. They also invited and encouraged their other friends from the Yakuza, to torment Furuta. According to their trial statements, the four of them raped her over 400 times, beat her, starved her, hung her from the ceiling and used her as a \"punching bag\", dropped barbells onto her stomach, forced her to eat live cockroaches and drink her own urine, and forced her to masturbate in front of them. They inserted foreign objects into her vagina and anus, including a lit light bulb into her vagina and fireworks. They burned her vagina and clitoris with cigarettes and lighters, and her eyelids with hot wax. They also tore off her left nipple with pliers and pierced her breasts with sewing needles.\n\nSome of the torturers' friends have been officially identified, including Tetsuo Nakamura (now Tetsuo Yamada), and Koichi Ihara, who were charged with rape after their DNA was found on and in the victim's body. Koichi Ihara was allegedly bullied into raping Furuta. After he left the Minato household, he told his brother about the incident. His brother subsequently told their parents, who contacted police. Two police officers were dispatched to the Minato house; however, they were informed that there was no girl inside. The police officers declined an invitation to look around the house, believing the invitation was sufficient proof that there was no girl in the Minato house. Both officers faced considerable backlash from the community. Had they done their due diligence, Furuta's ordeal would have only lasted sixteen days and she may well have recovered from her injuries. The two officers were fired for failing to follow procedure.\n\nAt the beginning of December, Furuta attempted to call the police. However, she was discovered by Hiroshi before she could say anything. When the police phoned back, Miyano informed them that it was a mistake. As punishment, they doused her legs and feet in lighter fluid and set them on fire. They also pushed a large bottle into her anus, causing severe bleeding. She reportedly went into convulsions. During their trial, they stated that they thought she was faking a seizure, so they set her on fire again. She survived these injuries and continued to be raped and tortured. Furuta is reported to have asked her captors on multiple occasions to \"kill her and get it over with\", but they refused. Instead, they forced her to sleep outside on the balcony (it was winter at that time) and locked her in a freezer. One of the kidnappers told the court that her hands and legs were so badly damaged that it took her over an hour to drag herself downstairs to use the washroom. Due to the severity of the torture, she eventually lost bladder and bowel control and was beaten for soiling the carpets. She was also unable to drink water or consume food and would vomit after each attempt. She was also severely beaten for this.\n\nThe brutality of the attacks drastically altered Furuta's appearance. Her face was so swollen that it was difficult to make out her features. Her body was also severely crippled, giving off a rotting smell that caused the four boys to lose sexual interest in her. As a result, the boys kidnapped and gang-raped a 19-year-old woman who, like Furuta, was on her way home from work.\n\nOn 4 January 1989, the four boys challenged Furuta to a game of Mahjong, which she is said to have won. Out of frustration, the boys beat her with an iron barbell, kicked and punched her, and placed two short candles on her eyelids, burning them with the hot wax. They made her stand, and struck her feet with a swinging stick. At this point, she fell onto a stereo and collapsed into a fit of convulsions. Since she was bleeding profusely, and pus was emerging from her infected burns, the four boys covered their hands in plastic bags taped at the wrists. They continued to beat her and dropped an iron exercise ball onto her stomach several times. They poured lighter fluid onto her thighs, arms, face, and stomach and once again set her on fire. Furuta allegedly made attempts to put out the fire, but gradually became unresponsive. The attack reportedly lasted two hours. Furuta eventually succumbed to her wounds and died that day.\n\nLess than twenty-four hours after her death, Nobuharu Minato's brother called to tell him that Furuta appeared to be dead. Afraid of being caught for murder, they wrapped her body in blankets and shoved it into a travel bag. They then put her body in a 55-gallon (208 liters) drum and filled it with wet concrete. Around 8:00 pm, they loaded and eventually disposed the drum into a cement truck in Kōtō, Tokyo.\n\nOn 23 January 1989, Hiroshi Miyano and Jō Ogura were arrested for the gang-rape of the 19-year-old woman they had kidnapped in December. On 29 March, two police officers came to interrogate them, as women's underwear had been found at their addresses. During the interrogation, one of the officers led Miyano into thinking he knew of Furuta's murder. Thinking that Jō Ogura had confessed to the crime, Miyano told the police where to find Furuta's body. The police were initially puzzled by the confession, as they had been talking about the murder of another woman and her seven-year-old son that had occurred nine days prior to Furuta's abduction. That case remains unsolved to this day.\n\nThe police found the drum containing Furuta's body the following day. She was identified via fingerprints. On 1 April 1989 Jō Ogura was arrested for another sexual assault, and subsequently re-arrested for murder. The arrest of Yasushi Watanabe, Nobuharu Minato, and Minato's brother followed.\n\nDespite the shocking brutality of their crime, the identities of the boys were sealed by the court since they were all considered to be juveniles at the time of the crime. Journalists from the \"Shūkan Bunshun\" magazine discovered their identities, however, and published them. They stated that, given the severity of the crime, the accused did not deserve to have their right to anonymity upheld. All four boys pled guilty to \"committing bodily injury that resulted in death\", rather than murder.\n\nIn July 1990, a lower court sentenced Hiroshi Miyano, the alleged leader of the crime, to 17 years in prison. He appealed his sentence, but Tokyo High Court judge Ryūji Yanase sentenced him to an additional three years in prison. The 20-year sentence is the second highest sentence after life imprisonment. He was 18 at the time of the murder. Miyano's mother reportedly sent Furuta's parents 50 million yen (USD 425,000), after selling their family home.\nIn 2004 he tried to get parole, but due to an incident, it was denied.\nIn January 2013, Miyano was re-arrested for fraud. Due to insufficient evidence, he was released without charge on the 31st of that month.\n\nNobuharu Minato, who originally received a four- to six-year sentence, was re-sentenced to five-to-nine years by Judge Ryūji Yanase upon appeal. He was 16 at the time of the murder. Nobuharu's parents and brother were not charged. Furuta's parents were dismayed by the sentences received by their daughter's killers and won a civil suit against the parents of Nobuharu Minato, in whose home the crimes were committed. After his release, Minato moved in with his mother. He has not worked since.\n\nYasushi Watanabe, who was originally sentenced to three-to-four years in prison, received an upgraded sentence of five-to-seven years. He was 17 at the time of the murder. After his release, he married a Romanian woman.\n\nFor his participation in the crime, Jō Ogura served eight years in a juvenile prison before he was released in August 1999. He was 17 at the time of the murder. After his release, he is said to have boasted about his role in the kidnapping, rape and torture of Furuta. In July 2004, he was arrested for assaulting Takatoshi Isono, an acquaintance he thought his girlfriend may have been involved with. Jō tracked Isono down, beat him and shoved him into his truck. He drove him from Adachi to his mother's bar in Misato, where he allegedly beat Isono for four hours. During that time, Ogura repeatedly threatened to kill the man, telling him that he'd killed before and knew how to get away with it. He was sentenced to seven years in prison for the assault and has since been released. Ogura's mother allegedly vandalized Furuta's grave, stating that she had ruined her son's life. It has also been reported that Ogura has run through his father's savings (money which was originally meant for Furuta's family), buying and consuming a number of luxury goods.\n\nThe sentences were largely regarded as being far too light for the crimes committed, all four individuals were protected by special provisions applied to individuals 18 years old and younger.\n\nDuring sentencing, the judge commented that \"exceptionally grave and atrocious violence\" had been inflicted upon the victim, and that Junko Furuta had been \"murdered so brutally at the young age of 17, [that her] soul must be wandering in torment\". Hearing the details of the brutal rape and torture, a spectator in the gallery fainted. Furuta's mother also reportedly had a mental breakdown, which required psychiatric treatment.\n\nJunko Furuta's funeral was held on 2 April 1989. One of her friends' memorial address stated:\n\nJun-chan, welcome back. I have never dreamed that we would see you again in this way. You must have been in so much pain ... so much suffering ... The happi we all made for the school festival looked really good on you. We will never forget you. I have heard that the headmaster has presented you with a graduation certificate. So we graduated together – all of us. Jun-chan, there is no more pain, no more suffering. Please rest in peace...\"\n\nFuruta's part-time employer, whom she worked for prior to her kidnapping and murder, presented her parents with the uniform she would need to wear as a full-time employee. The uniform was placed in her coffin. The location near where Furuta's body was discovered has been developed since and is now Wakasu park.\n\nAt least three Japanese-language books have been written about the incident.\n\nAn exploitation film, \"Joshikōsei konkurīto-zume satsujin-jiken\" (, \"Concrete-Encased High School Girl Murder Case\"), was made about the incident by Katsuya Matsumura in 1995. Yujin Kitagawa (later a member of the music duo Yuzu) played the role of the principal culprit.\n\nSeiji Fujii wrote a novel about the case, \"17-sai\" (\"Seventeen years old\"), which was turned into a manga by Yōji Kamata. Contrary to what had really happened, the novel shows a happy ending for the girl, who survives and her kidnappers are sentenced to jail for many years. Waita Uziga (author of \"Mai-chan's Daily Life\") also made a controversial manga, \"Shin Gendai Ryōkiden\", about the case, with much more violent and crude content.\n\nThe song \"Junko Furuta\" by Indonesian musician Danilla Riyadi is a tribute to her.\n\nSong \"44 Days\" by musician Mr. Kitty is about the incident. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1556918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1556918", "title": "Phase response curve", "text": "Phase response curve\n\nA phase response curve (PRC) tabulates the transient change in the cycle period of an oscillator induced by a perturbation as a function of the phase at which it is received.\n\nConsider the dynamical system of the form\nwhere formula_2 is the oscillator state variable, formula_3 is the vector field. We assume that the system has an exponentially stable periodic orbit formula_4 with period formula_5; that is, formula_6. Since formula_4 is exponentially stable periodic orbit, then it will attract an open neighborhood formula_8 of formula_4. Such a set formula_8 is called the basin of attraction of the orbit formula_4. \nWe can now introduce the phase formula_12 as a coordinate along the limit cycle formula_4, such that it grows monotonically in the direction of the motion and gains formula_14 during each rotation. Moreover, we demand that the phase grows uniformly in time so that it obeys the equation \nwhere formula_16 is the natural frequency of the oscillations. By the chain rule we then have\nwhere the gradient is evaluated along the limit cycle formula_4.\n\nIt can be obtained from any nonuniformly rotating formula_14-periodic angle variable formula_20 on the cycle through the transformation \n\nThe phase variable could be defined in such a way that it rotates uniformly not only on the cycle but also in its neighborhood. To do this, we need to define the so-called isochrons, which were first introduced by Winfree(1967) and then by Guckenheimer(1975) and Kuramoto(1984). The construction of these curves in the vicinity of the limit cycle formula_4 is illustrated in Figure 2 below.\n\nIn humans and animals, there is a regulatory system that governs the phase relationship of an organism's internal circadian clock to a regular periodicity in the external environment (usually governed by the solar day). In most organisms, a stable phase relationship is desired, though in some cases the desired phase will vary by season, especially among mammals with seasonal mating habits.\n\nIn circadian rhythm research, a PRC illustrates the relationship between a chronobiotic's time of administration (relative to the internal circadian clock) and the magnitude of the treatment's effect on circadian phase. Specifically, a PRC is a graph showing, by convention, time of the subject's endogenous day along the \"x\"-axis and the amount of the phase shift (in hours) along the \"y\"-axis. The curve has one peak and one nadir in each 24-hour cycle. Relative circadian time is plotted vs. phase shift magnitude. The treatment is usually narrowly specified as a set intensity and colour and duration of light exposure to the retina and skin, or a set dose and formulation of melatonin.\n\nThese curves are often consulted in the therapeutic setting. Normally, the body's various physiological rhythms will be synchronized within an individual organism (human or animal), usually with respect to a master biological clock. Of particular importance is the sleep–wake cycle. Various sleep disorders and externals stresses (such as jet lag) can interfere with this. People with non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder often experience an inability to maintain a consistent internal clock. Extreme chronotypes usually maintain a consistent clock, but find that their natural clock does not align with the expectations of their social environment. PRC curves provide a starting point for therapeutic intervention. The two common treatments used to shift the timing of sleep are light therapy, directed at the eyes, and administration of the hormone melatonin, usually taken orally. Either or both can be used daily. The phase adjustment is generally cumulative with consecutive daily administrations, and—at least partially—additive with concurrent administrations of distinct treatments. If the underlying disturbance is stable in nature, ongoing daily intervention is usually required. For jet lag, the intervention serves mainly to accelerate natural alignment, and ceases once desired alignment is achieved.\n\nNote that PRC curves from the experimental setting are usually aggregates of the test population, that there can be mild or significant variation within the test population, that individuals with sleep disorders often respond atypically, and that the formulation of the chronobiotic might be specific to the experimental setting and not generally available in clinical practice (e.g. for melatonin, one sustained-release formulation might differ in its release rate as compared to another); also, while the magnitude is dose-dependent, not all PRC graphs cover a range of doses. The discussions below are restricted to the PRCs for the light and melatonin in humans.\n\nStarting about two hours before an individual's regular bedtime, exposure of the eyes to light will delay the circadian phase, causing later wake-up time and later sleep onset. The delaying effect gets stronger as evening progresses; it is also dependent on the wavelength and illuminance (\"brightness\") of the light. The effect is small in dim indoor lighting.\n\nAbout five hours after usual bedtime, coinciding with the body temperature nadir (the lowest point of the core body temperature during sleep) the PRC peaks and the effect changes abruptly from phase delay to phase advance. Immediately after this peak, light exposure has its greatest phase-advancing effect, causing earlier wake-up and sleep onset. Again, illuminance greatly affects results; indoor light may be less than 500 lux while light therapy uses up to 10,000 lux. The effect diminishes until about two hours after spontaneous wake-up time, when it reaches approximately zero.\n\nDuring the period between two hours after usual wake-up time and two hours before usual bedtime, light exposure has little or no effect on circadian phase (slight effects generally cancelling each other out).\n\nAnother image of the PRC for light is here (Figure 1). Within that image, the explanatory text is \n\nLight therapy, typically with a light box producing 10,000 lux at a prescribed distance, can be used in the evening to delay or in the morning to advance a person's sleep timing. Because losing sleep to obtain bright light exposure is considered undesirable by most people, and because it is very difficult to estimate exactly when the greatest effect (the PRC peak) will occur in an individual, the treatment is usually applied daily just prior to bedtime (to achieve phase delay), or just after spontaneous awakening (to achieve phase advance).\n\nIn addition to its use in the adjustment of circadian rhythms, light therapy is used as treatment for several affective disorders, especially seasonal affective disorder (SAD) but also nonseasonal unipolar depression and bipolar depression. Some evidence (and clinical guidelines) suggest that midday or evening light may be best suited for the treatment of depressive episodes in bipolar patients, to avoid the triggering of (hypo)mania by morning light.\n\nIn 2002 Brown University researchers led by David Berson announced the discovery of special cells in the human eye, ipRGCs (intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells), which many researchers now believe control the light entrainment effect of the phase response curve. In the human eye, the ipRGCs have the greatest response to light in the 460–480 nm (blue) range. In one experiment, 400 lux of blue light produced the same effects as 10,000 lux of white light. A theory of spectral opponency, in which the addition of other spectral colors renders blue light less effective for circadian phototransduction, was supported by research reported in 2005.\n\nThe phase response curve for melatonin is roughly twelve hours out of phase with the phase response curve for light. At spontaneous wake-up time, exogenous (externally administered) melatonin has a slight phase-delaying effect. The amount of phase-delay increases until about eight hours after wake-up time, when the effect swings abruptly from strong phase delay to strong phase advance. The phase-advance effect diminishes as the day goes on until it reaches zero about bedtime. From usual bedtime until wake-up time, exogenous melatonin has no effect on circadian phase.\n\nThe human body produces its own (endogenous) melatonin starting about two hours before bedtime, provided the lighting is dim. This is known as \"dim-light melatonin onset\", DLMO. This stimulates the phase-advance portion of the PRC and helps keep the body on a regular sleep-wake schedule. It also helps prepare the body for sleep.\n\nAdministration of melatonin at any time may have a mild hypnotic (sleep-inducing) effect. The expected effect on sleep phase timing, if any, is predicted by the PRC.\n\nIn a 2006 study Victoria L. Revell \"et al.\" showed that a combination of morning bright light and afternoon melatonin, both timed to phase advance according to the respective PRCs, produce a larger phase advance shift than bright light alone, for a total of up to 2 hours. All times are approximate and vary from one person to another. In particular, there is no convenient way to accurately determine the times of the peaks and zero-crossings of these curves in an individual. Administration of light or melatonin close to the time at which the effect is expected to change sense abruptly may, if the changeover time is not accurately known, produce an opposite effect to that desired.\n\nThe first published usage of the term \"phase response curve\" was in 1960 by Patricia DeCoursey. The \"daily\" activity rhythms of her flying squirrels, kept in constant darkness, responded to pulses of light exposure. The response varied according to the time of day—that is, the animals' subjective \"day\"—when light was administered. When DeCoursey plotted all her data relating the quantity and direction (advance or delay) of phase-shift on a single curve, she created the PRC. It has since been a standard tool in the study of biological rhythms.\n\nPhase response curve analysis can be used to understand the intrinsic properties and oscillatory behavior of regular-spiking neurons. The neuronal PRCs can be classified as being purely positive (PRC type I) or as having negative parts (PRC type II). Importantly, the PRC type exhibited by a neuron is indicative of its input–output function (excitability) as well as synchronization behavior: networks of PRC type II neurons can synchronize their activity via mutual excitatory connections, but those of PRC type I can not.\n\nExperimental estimation of PRC in living, regular-spiking neurons involves measuring the changes in inter-spike interval in response to a small perturbation, such as a transient pulse of current. Notably, the PRC of a neuron is not fixed but may change when firing frequency or neuromodulatory state of the neuron is changed.\n\n\n"}

Jackson\n\nRobert Houghwout Jackson (February 13, 1892 – October 9, 1954) was an American attorney and judge who served as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. He had previously served as United States Solicitor General, and United States Attorney General, and is the only person to have held all three of those offices. Jackson was also notable for his work as the Chief United States Prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals following World War II.\n\nJackson was admitted to the bar through a combination of reading law with an established attorney and attending law school. He is the most recent justice without a law degree to be appointed to the Supreme Court. Jackson is well known for his advice that, \"Any lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect, in no uncertain terms, to make no statement to the police under any circumstances\", and for his aphorism describing the Supreme Court, \"We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.\" Jackson developed a reputation as one of the best writers on the Supreme Court and one of the most committed to enforcing due process as protection from overreaching federal agencies.\n\nJackson was born on a family farm in Spring Creek Township, Warren County, Pennsylvania on February 13, 1892, and was raised in Frewsburg, New York. The son of William Eldred Jackson and Angelina Houghwout, he graduated from Frewsburg High School in 1909 and spent the next year as a post-graduate student attending Jamestown High School, where he worked to hone his writing skills.\n\nJackson decided on a legal career; since attendance at college or law school wasn't a requirement if a student learned under the tutelage of an established attorney, at age 18 he began to study law with the Jamestown, New York firm in which his uncle, Frank Mott, was a partner. His uncle soon introduced him to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was then serving as a member of the New York State Senate. Jackson attended Albany Law School of Union University from 1911 to 1912. At the time, students at Albany Law School had three options: taking individual courses without receiving a degree; completing a two-year program and receiving an LL.B. degree; or demonstrating the knowledge required of a first-year student and then taking the second year of the two-year program, which produced a certificate of completion. Jackson chose the third option; he successfully completed the second-year courses, and received his certificate in 1912.\n\nAfter completing the year at Albany Law School, Jackson returned to Jamestown to complete his studies. He passed the bar examination in 1913, and then joined a law practice in Jamestown. In 1916, he married Irene Alice Gerhardt, in Albany. In 1917, Jackson was recruited to work for Penney, Killeen & Nye, a leading Buffalo firm, primarily defending the International Railway Company in trials and appeals. In late 1918, Jackson was recruited back to Jamestown to serve as the city's corporation counsel.\n\nOver the next 15 years, he built a successful practice, and became a leading lawyer in New York State; he also enhanced his reputation nationally, through leadership roles with bar associations and other legal organizations. In 1930, Jackson was elected to membership in the American Law Institute; in 1933, he was elected Chairman of the American Bar Association's Conference of Bar Association Delegates (a predecessor to today's ABA House of Delegates).\n\nJackson became active in politics as a Democrat; in 1916, he spearheaded Jamestown's local Wilson for President organization. In the years during and after World War I, he was a member of the New York State Democratic Committee. He also continued his association with Roosevelt; when Roosevelt served as Governor of New York from 1929 to 1933, he appointed Jackson to a commission which reviewed the state judicial system and proposed reforms. Jackson also turned down Roosevelt's offer to appoint him to the New York Public Service Commission, because he preferred to remain in private practice.\n\nIn 1932, Jackson was active in Franklin Roosevelt's Presidential campaign as Chairman of an organization called Democratic Lawyers for Roosevelt. (Another Robert H. Jackson was also active in the Roosevelt campaign. That Jackson (1880-1973) was Secretary of the Democratic National Committee, and was a resident of New Hampshire.)\n\nIn 1934, Jackson agreed to join the Roosevelt administration; he served initially as Assistant General Counsel of the U.S. Treasury Department's Bureau of Internal Revenue (today's Internal Revenue Service), where he was in charge of 300 lawyers who tried cases before the Board of Tax Appeals. In 1936, Jackson became Assistant Attorney General, heading the Tax Division of the Department of Justice, and in 1937, he became Assistant Attorney General, heading the Antitrust Division.\n\nJackson was a supporter of the New Deal, litigating against corporations and utilities holding companies. He participated in the 1934 prosecution of Samuel Insull, the 1935 income tax case against Andrew Mellon, and the 1937 anti-trust case against Alcoa, in which the Mellon family held an important interest.\n\nIn March 1938, Jackson became United States Solicitor General, serving until January 1940 as the government's chief advocate before the Supreme Court. During his time in this post, he argued 44 cases to the Supreme Court on behalf of the federal government, and lost only six. His record of accomplishment caused Justice Louis Brandeis to once remark that Jackson should be Solicitor General for life.\n\nRoosevelt regarded Jackson as a possible successor to the Presidency in 1940, and worked with his staff on an effort to raise Jackson's public profile. Their plan was to mention Jackson favorably in Presidential remarks as often as possible, and to have Jackson take part frequently in Roosevelt's public appearances. Roosevelt and his advisers next intended for Jackson to become the Democratic nominee for Governor of New York in 1938. They abandoned their effort to create a groundswell of support for Jackson's gubernatorial candidacy when they ran into resistance from state Democratic Party leaders. In addition, Roosevelt's decision to run for a third term in 1940 rendered moot the need to identify and promote a successor. Instead of running for Governor or President, Jackson joined Roosevelt's cabinet when he was appointed as Attorney General.\n\nJackson was then appointed to be the 57th Attorney General of the United States by Roosevelt, on January 4, 1940, replacing Frank Murphy. As Attorney General, Jackson supported a bill introduced by Sam Hobbs, that would have legalized wiretapping by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or any other government agency, if it was suspected that a felony was occurring. The bill was opposed by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman James Lawrence Fly, and it did not pass.\n\nWhile Jackson was Attorney General, he helped President Roosevelt organize the Lend-Lease agreement, which allowed the United States' to supply materials to help with the war effort to the other Allied forces, before formally entering World War II.\n\nWhen Harlan Fiske Stone replaced the retiring Charles Evans Hughes as Chief Justice in 1941, Roosevelt appointed Jackson to the resulting vacant Associate's seat. The nomination was sent to Congress on June 12, 1941, and Jackson was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 7, 1941, receiving his commission on July 11, 1941. Robert H. Jackson was the 82nd Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, where he was known for his eloquent writing style and championing of individual liberties.\n\nIn 1943, Jackson wrote the majority opinion in \"West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette\", which overturned a public school regulation making it mandatory to salute the flag, and imposing penalties of expulsion and prosecution upon students who failed to comply. Jackson's stirring language in \"Barnette\" concerning individual rights is widely quoted. Jackson's concurring opinion in 1952's \"Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer\" (forbidding President Harry Truman's seizure of steel mills during the Korean War to avert a strike), in which Jackson formulated a three-tier test for evaluating claims of Presidential power, remains one of the most widely cited opinions in Supreme Court history. (It was quoted repeatedly by Supreme Court nominees John Roberts and Samuel Alito, during their confirmation hearings.)\n\nJustices Jackson and Hugo Black had profound professional and personal disagreements dating back to October 1941, the first term during which they served together on the Supreme Court. According to Dennis Hutchinson, editor of \"The Supreme Court Review\", Jackson objected to Black's practice of importing his personal preferences into his jurisprudence. Hutchinson quotes Jackson as having remarked, \"With few exceptions, we all knew which side of a case Black would vote on when he read the names of the parties.\" While Hutchinson points out that Jackson objected to Black's style of jurisprudence in such cases as \"Minersville v. Gobitis\" (1940) and \"United States v. Bethlehem Steel\" (1942), Black's involvement in the Jewell Ridge case struck Jackson as especially injudicious.\n\nIn \"Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers\" (1945), the Supreme Court faced the issue of whether to grant the coal company's petition for a rehearing, on the grounds that the victorious miners were, in a previous matter, represented by Crampton P. Harris, who was Justice Black's former law partner and personal lawyer. Despite this apparent conflict of interest, Black lobbied the Court for a per curiam denial of the petition. Justice Jackson objected, with the result that Jackson filed a concurrence disassociating himself from the ruling and, by implication, criticizing Black for not addressing the conflict of interest. Jackson also strongly objected to Black's judicial conduct in \"Jewell Ridge\" for another reason. As Jackson later alleged, while Justice Murphy was preparing his opinion, Black urged that the court hand down its decision without waiting for the opinion and dissent. In Jackson's eyes, the \"...only apparent reason behind this proposal was to announce the decision in time to influence the contract negotiations during the coal strike\" between the coal company and the miners, which were taking place at the time.\n\nJackson probably regarded Black's conduct as unbecoming of a Supreme Court Justice in another related matter. On April 3, 1945, the Southern Conference for Human Welfare held a dinner, at which it honored Justice Black as the 1945 recipient of the Thomas Jefferson Award. Fred M. Vinson spoke at the dinner. While Jackson declined an invitation to the event, citing a conflict arising out of the fact that a number of leading sponsors of the dinner were then litigants before the Supreme Court, Black attended the dinner and received his award. Crampton Harris, counsel in two pending cases, \"Jewell Ridge\" and \"CIO v. McAdory\" (1945), was one of the sponsors.\n\nJackson later took these grievances public in two public cables from Nuremberg. Jackson had informally been promised the Chief Justiceship by Roosevelt; however, the seat came open while Jackson was in Germany, and Roosevelt was dead. President Harry S. Truman was faced with two factions, one recommending Jackson for the seat, and the other advocating for Hugo Black. In an attempt to avoid controversy, Truman appointed Vinson. Jackson blamed machinations by Black for his being passed over for the seat, and publicly exposed some of Black's controversial behavior and feuding within the Court. The controversy was heavily covered in the press, and cast the New Deal Court in a negative light, and had the effect of tarnishing Jackson's reputation in the years that followed.\n\nOn June 8, 1946, Jackson sent a cable to President Truman. Jackson's cable to Truman began with an insincere offer of congratulations to the President for his appointment of Vinson. However, the cable then quickly addressed the rumor, which Jackson had gotten wind of in Nuremberg, according to which Truman had appointed Fred Vinson, in part, to avert a resignation on the part of Justice Black. Rumors had been circulating in Washington that Black would resign in the event that Truman chose Jackson as Chief Justice Stone's successor. \"I would be loathe to believe that you would concede to any man a veto over court appointments.\" Jackson closed his cable by stating that he could not continue his service as an Associate Justice under Vinson if an associate \"had something on [him]\", which would disqualify him from serving, or if he, Truman, regarded Jackson's opinion in the \"Jewell Ridge\" case as a \"gratuitous insult\" to Justice Black.\n\nAfter receiving a response from Truman in which he denied having given consideration to, or having even heard of, the rumor of Black's threatened resignation, Jackson rashly fired off a second cable to Congress, on June 10. This cable stated Jackson's reasons for his belief that Justice Black faced a conflict of interest in \"Jewell Ridge\", from which he wrongfully, at least, in Jackson's eyes, did not recuse himself, and ended with Jackson's threat that if such a practice \"is ever repeated while I am on the bench, I will make my \"Jewell Ridge\" opinion look like a letter of recommendation, by comparison.\"\n\nIn 1919, the Supreme Court decided \"Schenck v. United States\". In Schenck, the petitioners, members of the Socialist Party were convicted of violating the Espionage Act of 1917, for printing and distributing circulars asserting that American citizens had a right to oppose the draft during World War I because, among other things, it violated the United States Constitution. The Schenck decision promulgated the \"clear and present danger test,\" which provided the standard for sustaining a conviction when speech is relied upon as evidence that an offense has been committed. Justice Holmes, writing for a unanimous court, affirmed the decision of the lower court positing:\n\nWe admit that, in many places and in ordinary times, the defendants, in saying all that was said in the circular, would have been within their constitutional rights. But the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done. . . The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances, and are of such a nature as to create a \"clear and present danger\" that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.\n\nIn 1951, the Supreme Court decided \"Dennis v. United States\". In Dennis, the petitioners were zealous Communists who organized for the purpose of teaching the \"Marxist-Leninist Doctrine\". The principal texts used to teach the doctrine were: \"History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\"; \"Foundations of Leninism\" by Stalin; \"The Communist Manifesto\" by Marx and Engels; and \"State and Revolution\" by Lenin. The Petitioners were convicted for violating clause 2 and clause 3 of the Smith Act which, among other things, made it unlawful to conspire to organize a group which advocates the overthrow of the United States government, by force or violence. The issue before the Supreme Court was \"[w]hether either §2 or §3 of the Smith Act, inherently, or as construed and applied in the instant case, violates the First Amendment and other provisions of the Bill of Rights...\"\n\nIn Dennis, Jackson concluded that the \"clear and present danger test\" should not be applied. To this end, Jackson analyzed: the effect Communism had outside the United States; the nature of Communists; and the problems with applying the test. Jackson's analysis can be summarized as follows:\n\nOn the effect that Communists historically had on foreign countries, Jackson analyzed their effect on Czechoslovakia. In Czechoslovakia, a Communist organization disguised as a competing political faction secretly established its roots in key control positions \"of police and information services\". During a period of national crisis, a clandestine Communist organization appeared, and overthrew the Czechoslovakian government. Establishing control of mass communication and industry, the Communist organization's rule was one of \"oppression and terror\". Ironically, as Jackson points out, the Communist organization suppressed the very freedoms which made its conspiracy possible.\n\nOn the nature of Communists, Jackson characterizes them as an extraordinarily dedicated and highly selective group, disciplined and indoctrinated by Communist policy. The goal of Party members is to secretly infiltrate key positions of government, industry, and unions, and to leverage their power once in such positions. Jackson goes on to say that, although \"Communist[s] have no scruples against sabotage, terrorism, assassination, or mob disorder\", they \"advocate force only when prudent\", which \"may never be necessary, because infiltration and deception may be enough\".\n\nOn the problems with applying the clear and present danger test in Dennis, Jackson deems significant that the test was authored \"before the era of World War II revealed the subtlety and efficacy of modernized revolutionary technique used by totalitarian parties.\" Jackson believed that the application of the test should be limited to cases bearing strong enough likeness to those for which it was originally crafted – i.e., \"...criminality of hot-headed speech on a street corner, or parading by some zealots behind a red flag, or refusal of a handful of Jehovah Witness school children to salute our flag\". Expressing strong concern that the expansive construction the Court had recently given the test in \"Bridges v. State of California\", Jackson asserted that the test provided Communists with \"unprecedented immunities\", while the \"Government is captive in a judge-made verbal trap.\" Jackson goes on to describe the application of the test to Communists, when determining the constitutionality of the Smith Act facially, or as applied as one of \"...apprais[ing] imponderables, including international and national phenomena, which baffle the best informed foreign offices and our most experienced politicians.\"\n\nJackson concludes his First Amendment analysis in Dennis by asserting that:\n\nThe authors of the \"clear and present danger test\" never applied it to a case like this, nor would I. If applied as it is proposed here, it means that the Communist plotting is protected during its period of incubation; its preliminary stages of organization and preparation are immune from the law; the Government can move only after imminent action is manifest, when it would, of course, be too late.\n\nIn the end, the Court applied its own version of the \"clear and present danger test\" in Dennis, essentially disregarding the analytical elements of probability and temporality which had previously appeared to be requirements of the doctrine. Jackson, however, as one commentator put it, expressed in Dennis (at least with regards to Communists) that, \"when used as part of a conspiracy to act illegally, speech loses its First Amendment protection.\"\n\nJackson's hardened stance on the First Amendment in Dennis may be attributed to strong anti-Communist sentiment, which had a grip on Americans during the time of the decision. In William Wiecek's article discussing the history of anti-communism in the United States, he asserts that:\n\n[T]he manufactured image of the domestic Communist, cultivated and propagated by [J. Edgar] Hoover, the Catholic Church, the American Legion, and political opportunists, made of Communists something less than full humans, full citizens, fully rights-endowed. Even sophisticated jurists like ... Robert Jackson were captives of that image, anesthetizing [his] sensitivity to [the] deprivation of [their] rights. In Dennis and other Communist cases between 1950 and 1956, the Supreme Court overcame the problem of facts not supporting the results [that] it was determined to reach, by accepting a generic 'proof' of Communism's seditious nature. Disregarding all evidence of both the Party's and individual members' renunciation of violence, the Court substituted literary evidence from outdated classics of Marxism-Leninism, most written by Europeans of an earlier era, and refused to consider whether the living people before them actually subscribed to those doctrines...\"\n\nFollowing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, there was great suspicion surrounding Japanese-Americans, particularly those residing on the West Coast of the United States. Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, giving the War Department permission to declare some zones \"military zones\", in which they could prohibit certain people from accessing prescribed areas. With this executive order, the War Department was able to declare that all United States citizens of Japanese ancestry were prohibited from areas in California that were deemed unsafe for Japanese-American habitation for national security purposes, and it forced them into internment camps.\n\nFred Korematsu, a United States citizen, born on American soil, believed that this was an unconstitutional infringement on an individual's civil liberty. The question that came before the Supreme Court of the United States, was whether the Executive and Legislative branches went beyond their war powers by depriving citizens of rights with no criminal basis.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided that the President and Congress did not stretch their war powers too far by choosing national security over an individual's rights in a time of war. Justice Hugo Black wrote the majority opinion for this case, and Justice Jackson wrote a dissenting opinion. The opening paragraph of Jackson's dissent illustrated his view of the case:\n\nKorematsu was born on our soil, of parents born in Japan. The Constitution makes him a citizen of the United States by nativity, and a citizen of California by residence. No claim is made that he is not loyal to this country. There is no suggestion that apart from the matter involved here, he is not law-abiding and well- disposed. Korematsu, however, has been convicted of an act not commonly a crime. It consists merely of being present in the state whereof he is a citizen, near the place where he was born, and where all his life he has lived.\n\nJustice Jackson warned of the danger that this great allowance of executive power presented, through the War Department's ability to deprive individual rights in favor of national security, in time of war:\n\nBut if we cannot confine military expedients by the Constitution, neither would I distort the Constitution to approve all that the military may deem expedient. That is what the Court appears to be doing, whether consciously or not. I cannot say, from any evidence before me, that the orders of General DeWitt were not reasonably expedient military precautions, nor could I say that they were. But even if they were permissible military procedures, I deny that it follows that they are constitutional. If, as the Court holds, it does follow, then we may as well say that any military order will be constitutional, and have done with it.\n\nRobert H. Jackson was not concerned in evaluating the validity of General DeWitt's claim that the internment of Japanese citizens on the West Coast was necessary for national security purposes, but whether this would set a precedent of war-time racial discrimination that would be used to strip individual liberties.\n\nOne of Jackson's law clerks during 1952 – 53, William H. Rehnquist, was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1971, and became Chief Justice in 1986. In December 1971, after Rehnquist's nomination had been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and was pending before the full Senate, a 1952 memorandum came to light that he had written as Jackson's law clerk in connection with the landmark case, \"Brown v. Board of Education,\" that argued in favor of affirming the separate-but-equal doctrine of \"Plessy v. Ferguson\". Rehnquist wrote a brief letter attributing the views to Jackson, and was confirmed. In his 1986 hearing, he was questioned about the matter. His explanation of the memorandum was disputed in both 1971 and 1986 by Jackson's former secretary, and scholars have questioned its plausibility. However, the papers of Justices Douglas and Frankfurter indicate that Justice Jackson voted for \"Brown\" in 1954 only after changing his mind.\n\nThe views of Justice Jackson about \"Brown\" can be found in his 1954 unpublished draft concurrence. The \"Memorandum by Mr. Justice Jackson, March 15th, 1954\", is available with Jackson's papers in the Library of Congress, but did not become publicly available until after Rehnquist's 1986 hearing for Chief Justice of the United States. Jackson's draft concurrence in \"Brown\", divided into four parts, shows how he struggled with how to write an effective opinion to strike down segregation. In Part 1 of Jackson's draft concurrence in \"Brown\", he wrote that he went to school where, \"Negro pupils were very few\" and that he was \"predisposed to the conclusion that segregation elsewhere has outlived whatever justification it may have had.\" Despite his own opinions regarding desegregation, Jackson acknowledged the inability of the Court to \"eradicate\" the \"fears, prides and prejudices\" that made segregation an important social practice in the South. Jackson thus concluded that the Northerners on the court should be sensitive to the conditions that brought segregation to the South.\n\nIn Part 2 of the draft memorandum, Justice Jackson described the legal framework for forbidding segregation in \"Does Existing Law Condemn Segregation?\". Jackson notes that it was difficult for the Court, which expected \"not to make new law, but only to declare existing law,\" to overturn a decision of such longevity as \"Plessy\". Looking at the doctrine of original intent with regard to the Fourteenth Amendment, Justice Jackson found no evidence that segregation was prohibited, particularly since states that had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment had segregated schools at the time. Jackson concluded, \"I simply cannot find in the conventional material of constitutional interpretation any justification for saying\" that segregated schools violated the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nPart 3 of the draft memorandum titled \"Enforcement Power Limits\", describes enforcement by Congress of the Fourteenth Amendment. Jackson addressed the possibility of leaving enforcement to Congress, particularly because the \"courts have no power to enforce general declarations of law.\" Jackson noted that while segregation was already fading in some states, it would be difficult to overcome in those states where segregation was firmly established. While Jackson recognized the difficulties in the Supreme Court enforcing its judgment, he did not want the task to be left to the lower courts, as suggested by the Government. Jackson concluded that the court must act because \"our representative system has failed\", and even though this \"premise is not a sound basis for judicial action.\"\n\nFinally, in Part 4 of the draft memorandum \"Changed Conditions\", Jackson began by stating that prior to \"Brown\", segregation was legal. According to Jackson, the premise for overruling \"Plessy\" was the now erroneous \"factual assumption\" that \"there were differences between the Negro and the white races, viewed as a whole.\" The draft asserted that the \"spectacular\" progress of African-Americans, under adverse circumstances, \"enabled [them] to outgrow the system and to overcome the presumptions on which it was based.\" Jackson emphasized that the changed conditions, along with the importance of a public education, required the court to strike down the concept of \"separate but equal\" in public education. While Jackson could not justify the decision in \"Brown\" in law, he did so on the basis of a political and social imperative. It is unknown if Jackson ever intended to publish this concurrence.\n\nJustice Jackson was in the hospital from March 30 to May 17, 1954. It is reported that Chief Justice Warren visited Jackson in the hospital several times, and discussed both Jackson's draft opinion and Warren's drafts. One suggestion that Warren took from Jackson was adding the following sentence: \"Negroes have achieved outstanding success in the arts and sciences, as well as in the business and professional world.\" This quote is tied to the arguments in Part 4 of Jackson's draft opinion. On May 17, 1954, Jackson went to the Court from the hospital, so that he could be there the day that the \"Brown\" decision was handed down. When the \"Brown\" decision was handed down, a full court was present, to emphasize the unanimity of the decision. Robert H. Jackson died on October 9, 1954, and so there was not enough time between \"Brown\" and the death of Jackson to fully explore his views on desegregation.\n\nJustice Jackson was a staunch defender (along with Justice Frankfurter) of procedural due process, for the rule of law that protects members of the public from overreaching by government agencies. One of his hymns to due process is often quoted:\n\nIn 1945, President Harry S. Truman appointed Jackson (who took a leave of absence from the Supreme Court), as U.S. Chief of Counsel for the prosecution of Nazi war criminals. He helped draft the London Charter of the International Military Tribunal, which created the legal basis for the Nuremberg Trials. He then served in Nuremberg, Germany, as United States Chief Prosecutor at the International Military Tribunal. Jackson pursued his prosecutorial role with a great deal of vigor. His opening and closing arguments before the Nuremberg court were widely celebrated. In the words of defendant Albert Speer:\n\nHowever, some believe that his cross-examination skills were generally weak, and it was British prosecutor David Maxwell-Fyfe who got the better of Hermann Göring in cross-examination, rather than Jackson, who was rebuked by the Tribunal for losing his temper and being repeatedly baited by Göring during the proceedings.\n\nOn March 30, 1954, Jackson had suffered a massive heart attack. He was confined to the hospital until May 17, when he returned to the court. He remained functioning in his position as Justice until October 4, 1954. On Saturday, October 9, 1954, Jackson suffered a myocardial infarction. At 11:45 a.m. he died at 62. Funeral services were held in Washington's National Cathedral, and later in Jamestown's St. Luke's Church. All 8 of the other Supreme Court Justices traveled together to Jamestown, New York, to attend his funeral service and, for security purposes, this was the last time that the Supreme Court all traveled together. Other prominent guests included Thomas E. Dewey. He was interred near his boyhood home in Frewsburg, New York. His headstone reads \"He kept the ancient landmarks and built the new.\" \n\nThe Robert H. Jackson Center, located in Robert H. Jackson's hometown of Jamestown, New York, offers guided tours to visitors, as well as exhibits on Jackson's life, and collections of his writings, and photos from the International Military Tribunal. An extensive collection of Jackson's personal and judicial papers is archived at the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, and is open for research. Smaller collections are available at several other repositories.\n\nThere are statues dedicated to Robert H. Jackson outside the Robert H. Jackson Center in Jamestown, New York, as well as the Robert H. Jackson field at the Chautauqua County-Jamestown Airport. The United States District Court for the Western District of New York main courthouse, which is located in Buffalo and opened in November, 2011, is dedicated to Justice Jackson and is named the Robert H. Jackson United States Courthouse.\n\nRobert H. Jackson has been portrayed by the following actors in film, television, and theater productions:\n\n\n\n"}

In a 5–4 decision, the Court upheld the provision in the \"Criminal Code\".\n\nSue Rodriguez was a 42-year-old mother whose illness amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or \"Lou Gehrig's disease\") was diagnosed in 1992. By 1993, it was found that she would not live more than a year, and so she began a crusade to strike down section 241(b) of the \"Criminal Code\", which made assisted suicide illegal, to the extent it would be illegal for a terminally ill person to commit \"physician-assisted\" suicide.\n\nShe applied to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to have section 241(b) of \"Criminal Code\" struck down because it allegedly violated sections 7 (the right to \"life, liberty, and security of the person), 12 (protection against \"cruel and unusual treatment or punishment\") and 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (equality).\n\nSopinka J, writing for the majority, found there was no violation of section 7. He first considered whether the prohibition on ending one's life engaged the right to security of person. He found the prohibition had sufficient connection with the justice system by its impact on an individual's autonomy and right to life by causing physical and psychological pain.\n\nHowever, Sopinka J found the provision did not violate any principles of fundamental justice. He examined the long history of the prohibition of suicide and concludes that it reflects part of the fundamental values of society and so could not be in violation of fundamental justice.\n\nHe also rejected the claim that the provision violated the section 12 right against cruel and unusual treatment or punishment as a mere prohibition did not fall within the meaning of treatment.\n\nLastly, he considered the section 15 equality challenge. He noted the issue is best not resolved under this right, but in assuming it did violate section 15, he found it was clearly saved under section 1. He found the objective was pressing and substantial, rational and that there was no lesser means to achieve the goal.\n\nIn dissent, Lamer CJ held that the \"Criminal Code\" section 241(b) had infringed on section 15, but he did not consider sections 7 and 12.\n\nCory J ruled that the right to die is as much a protected freedom under section 7 of the \"Charter\" as any other part of life.\n\nMcLachlin J's judgment was that \"Criminal Code\" section 241(b) violated the section 7 right to security of the person and that the violation was not saved under section 1.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling in \"Rodriguez\" was overturned 22 years later in the 2015 decision in \"Carter v Canada (AG)\", which found that denying assisted suicide in some cases violated Section 7 of the \"Charter\".\n\n"}

{"id": "47695176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47695176", "title": "Superhabitable planet", "text": "Superhabitable planet\n\nA superhabitable planet is a hypothetical type of exoplanet or exomoon that may be better suited than Earth for the emergence and evolution of life. The concept was introduced in 2014 by René Heller and John Armstrong, who have criticized the language used in the search for habitable planets, so they propose clarifications because a circumstellar habitable zone (HZ) is not enough to define a planet's habitability. Heller and Armstrong state that it is not clear why Earth should offer the most suitable physicochemical parameters to living organisms, because \"planets could be non-Earth-like, yet offer more suitable conditions for the emergence and evolution of life than Earth did or does.\" While still assuming that life requires water, they hypothesize that Earth may not represent the optimal planetary habitability conditions for maximum biodiversity; in other words, they define a superhabitable world as a terrestrial planet or moon that could support more diverse flora and fauna than there are on Earth, as it would empirically show that its environment is more hospitable to life.\n\nHeller and Armstrong also point out that not all rocky planets in a habitable zone (HZ) may be habitable, and that tidal heating can render terrestrial or icy worlds habitable beyond the stellar HZ, such as in Europa's internal ocean. The authors propose that in order to identify a habitable—or superhabitable—planet, a characterization concept is required that is biocentric rather than geo- or anthropocentric. Heller and Armstrong proposed to establish a profile for exoplanets according to stellar type, mass and location in their planetary system, among other features. According to these authors, such superhabitable worlds would likely be larger, warmer, and older than Earth, and orbiting K-type main-sequence stars.\n\nHeller and Armstrong proposed that a series of basic characteristics are required to classify an exoplanet or exomoon as superhabitable;\n\nOther factors to consider are the type of star in the system. K-type stars are less massive than the Sun, and are stable on the main sequence for a very long time (15 to 30 billion years, compared to 10 billion for the Sun, a G-class star), giving more time for the emergence of life and evolution. A superhabitable world would also require to be located near the center of the habitable zone of its star system for a long time.\n\nAn exoplanet with a larger volume than that of Earth, or with a more complex terrain, or with a larger surface covered with liquid water, could be more hospitable for life than Earth. Since the volume of a planet tends to be directly related to its mass, the more massive it is, the greater its gravitational pull, which can result in a denser atmosphere.\n\nSome studies indicate that there is a natural limit, set at 1.6R, below which nearly all planets are terrestrial, composed primarily of rock-iron-water mixtures. Generally, objects with a mass below 6 M are very likely to be of similar composition as Earth. Above this limit, the density of the planets decreases with increasing size, the planet will become a \"water world\" and finally a gas giant. In addition, most super-Earths' high mass may cause them to lack plate tectonics. Thus, it is expected that any exoplanet similar to Earth's density and with a radius under 1.6 R may be suitable for life. However, other studies indicate that water worlds represent a transitional stage between mini-Neptunes and the terrestrial planets, especially if they belong to red dwarfs or K dwarfs. Although water planets may be habitable, the average depth of the water and the absence of land area would not make them superhabitable as defined by Heller and Armstrong. From a geological perspective, the optimal mass of a planet is about 2 M, so it must have a radius that keeps the density of the Earth among 1.2 and 1.3R.\n\nThe average depth of the oceans also affects the habitability of a planet. The shallow areas of the sea, given the amount of light and heat they receive, usually are more comfortable for aquatic species, so it is likely that exoplanets with a lower average depth are more suitable for life. More massive exoplanets would tend to have a regular surface gravity, which can mean shallower—and more hospitable—ocean basins.\n\nPlate tectonics, in combination with the presence of large bodies of water on a planet, is able to maintain high levels of carbon dioxide () in its atmosphere. This process appears to be common in geologically active terrestrial planets with a significant rotation speed. The more massive a planetary body, the longer time it will generate internal heat, which is a major contributing factor to plate tectonics. However, excessive mass can also slow plate tectonics because of increased pressure and viscosity of the mantle, which hinders the sliding of the lithosphere. Research suggests that plate tectonics peaks in activity in bodies with a mass between 1 and 5M, with an optimum mass of approximately 2M.\n\nIf the geological activity is not strong enough to generate a sufficient amount of greenhouse gases to increase global temperatures above the freezing point of water, the planet could experience a permanent ice age, unless the process is offset by an intense internal heat source such as tidal heating or stellar irradiation.\n\nAnother feature favorable to life is a planet's potential to develop a strong magnetosphere to protect its surface and atmosphere from cosmic radiation and stellar winds, especially around red dwarf stars. Less massive bodies and those with a slow rotation, or those that are tidally locked, have a weak or no magnetic field, which over time can result in the loss of a significant portion of its atmosphere, especially hydrogen, by hydrodynamic escape.\nThe optimum temperature for Earth-like life in general is unknown, although it appears that on Earth organism diversity has been greater in warmer periods. It is therefore possible that exoplanets with slightly higher average temperatures than that of Earth are more suitable for life. The thermoregulatory effect of large oceans on exoplanets located in a habitable zone may maintain a moderate temperature range. In this case, deserts would be more limited in area and would likely support habitat-rich coastal environments.\n\nHowever, studies suggest that Earth already lies near to the inner edge of the habitable zone of the Solar System, and that may harm its long-term livability as the luminosities of main-sequence stars steadily increase over time, pushing the habitable zone outwards. Therefore, superhabitable exoplanets must be warmer than Earth, yet orbit further out than Earth does and closer to the center of the system's habitable zone. This would be possible with a thicker atmosphere or with a higher concentration of greenhouse gases.\n\nThe star's type largely determines the conditions present in a system. The most massive stars O, B, and A have a very short life cycle, quickly leaving the main sequence. In addition, O and B type stars produce a photoevaporation effect that prevents the accretion of planets around the star.\n\nOn the opposite side, the less massive M and K types are by far the most common and long-lived stars of the universe, but their potential for supporting life is still under study. Their low luminosity reduces the size of the habitable zone, which are exposed to ultraviolet radiation outbreaks that occur frequently, especially during their first billion year of existence. When a planet's orbit is too short, it can cause tidal locking of the planet, where it always presents the same hemisphere to the star, known as \"day hemisphere\". Even if the existence of life were possible in a system of this type, it is unlikely that any exoplanet belonging to a red dwarf star would be considered superhabitable.\n\nDismissing both ends, systems with a K-type stars offer the best habitable zones for life. K-type stars allow the formation of planets around them, have a long life expectancy, and provide a stable habitable zone free of the effects of excessive proximity to its star. Furthermore, the radiation produced by a K-type star is high enough to allow complex life without the need for an atmospheric ozone layer. They are also the most stable and their habitable zone does not move very much during its lifetime, so a terrestrial analog located near a K-type star may be habitable for almost all of the main sequence.\n\nExperts have not reached a consensus about what is the optimal rotation speed for an exoplanet, but it should not be too fast nor too slow. The latter case can cause some problems similar to those observed in Venus, which completes one rotation every 243 Earth days and as a result, cannot generate an Earth-like magnetic field.\n\nIdeally, the orbit of a superhabitable world must be at the midpoint of the habitable zone of its star system.\n\nThere are no solid arguments to explain if Earth's atmosphere has the optimal composition to host life. On Earth, during the period when coal was first formed, atmospheric oxygen () levels were up to 35%, and coincided with the periods of greatest biodiversity. So, assuming that the presence of a significant amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is essential for exoplanets to develop complex life forms, the percentage of oxygen relative to the total atmosphere appears to limit the maximum size of the planet for optimum superhabitability and ample biodiversity.\n\nAlso, the atmospheric density should be higher in more massive planets, which reinforces the hypothesis that super-Earths can provide superhabitable conditions.\n\nIn a biological context, older planets than Earth may have greater biodiversity, since native species have had more time to evolve, adapt and stabilize the environmental conditions to sustain a suitable environment for life that can benefit their descendants.\n\nHowever, for many years it was thought that since older star systems have lower metallicity, they should display low planet formation, and thus such old planets may have been scant in the beginning, but the number of \"metallic\" items in the universe must have grown steadily since its inception. The first exoplanetary discoveries, mostly gas giants orbiting very close to their stars, known as \"Hot Jupiters\", suggest that planets were rare in systems with low metallicity, which invited suspicion of a time limit on the appearance of the first objects landmass. Later, in 2012, the Kepler telescope's observations allowed experts to find out that this relationship is much more restrictive in systems with Hot Jupiters, and that terrestrial planets could form in stars of much lower metallicity, to some extent. It is now thought that the first Earth-mass objects should appear sometime between 7 and 12 billion years. Given the greater stability of the orange dwarfs (K-type) compared to the Sun (G-type) and longer life expectancy, it is possible that superhabitable exoplanets belonging to K-type stars, orbiting within its habitable zone, could provide a longer, steadier, and better environment for life than Earth.\n\nDespite the scarcity of information available, the hypotheses presented above on superhabitable planets can be summarized as a preliminary profile, even if there is no scientific consensus. \n\nThere is no confirmed exoplanet that meets all these requirements. After updating the database of exoplanets on 23 July 2015, the one that comes closest is Kepler-442b, belonging to an orange dwarf star, with a radius of 1.34R and a mass of 2.34M, but with an estimated surface temperature of .\n\nThe appearance of a superhabitable planet should be, in general, very similar to Earth. The main differences, in compliance with the profile seen previously, would be derived from its mass. Its denser atmosphere probably prevent the formation of ice sheets as a result of lower thermal difference between different regions of the planet. Also, it has a higher concentration of clouds, and abundant rainfall.\n\nProbably the vegetation is very different due to the increased air density, precipitation, temperature, and stellar flux. For the type of light emitted from the K-type stars, plants may take other colors than green. The vegetation would cover more regions than vegetation here on Earth, making this visible from space.\n\nIn general, the climate of a superhabitable planet would be warmer, moist, homogeneous and have stable land, allowing life to extend across the surface without presenting large population differences, in contrast to Earth that has inhospitable areas such as glaciers, deserts and tropical regions. If the atmosphere contains enough molecular oxygen, the conditions of these planets may be bearable to humans even without the protection of a space suit, provided that the atmosphere does not contain excessive toxic gases, but would require some adaptation to the increased gravity, such as an increase in muscles and in bone density, etc.\n\nHeller and Armstrong speculate that the number of superhabitable planets can far exceed that of Earth analogs: less massive stars in the main sequence are more abundant than the larger and brighter stars, so there are more orange dwarfs than solar analogues. It is estimated that about 9% of stars in the Milky Way are K-type stars.\n\nAnother point favoring the predominance of superhabitable planets in regard to Earth analogs is that, unlike the latter, most of the requirements of a superhabitable world can occur spontaneously and jointly simply by having a higher mass. A planetary body close to 2 or 3M should have longer-lasting plate tectonics and also will have a larger surface area in comparison to Earth. Similarly, it is likely that its oceans are shallower by the effect of gravity on the planet's crust, its gravitational field more intense and, a denser atmosphere.\n\nBy contrast, Earth-mass planets may have a wider range of conditions. For example, some may sustain active tectonics for a shorter time period and will therefore end up with lower air density than Earth, increasing the probability of developing global ice coverage, or even a permanent Snowball Earth scenario. Another negative effect of lower atmospheric density can be manifested in the form of thermal oscillations, which can lead to high variability in the global climate and increase the chance for catastrophic events. In addition, by having a weaker magnetosphere, such planets may lose their atmospheric hydrogen by hydrodynamic escape easier and become a desert planet. Any of these examples could prevent the emergence of life on a planet's surface. In any case, the multitude of scenarios that can turn an Earth-mass planet located in the habitable zone of a solar analogue into an inhospitable place are less likely on a planet that meets the basic features of a superhabitable world, so that the latter should be more common.\n\n\n\n"}

Koshland in 2002 in order to create a universal definition of life. One stated goal of this universal definition is to aid in understanding and identifying artificial and extraterrestrial life. The seven pillars are Program, Improvisation, Compartmentalization, Energy, Regeneration, Adaptability, and Seclusion. These can be abbreviated as PICERAS.\n\nKoshland defines \"Program\" as an \"organized plan that describes both the ingredients themselves and the kinetics of the interactions among ingredients as the living system persists through time.\" In natural life as it is known on Earth, the program operates through the mechanisms of nucleic acids and amino acids, but the concept of program can apply to other imagined or undiscovered mechanisms.\n\n\"Improvisation\" refers to the living system's ability to change its program in response to the larger environment in which it exists. An example of improvisation on earth is natural selection.\n\n\"Compartmentalization\" refers to the separation of spaces in the living system that allow for separate environments for necessary chemical processes. Compartmentalization is necessary to protect the concentration of the ingredients for a reaction from outside environments.\n\nBecause living systems involve net movement in terms of chemical movement or body movement, and lose energy in those movements through entropy, energy is required for a living system to exist. The main source of energy on Earth is the sun, but other sources of energy exist for life on Earth, such as hydrogen gas or methane, used in chemosynthesis.\n\n\"Regeneration\" in a living system refers to the general compensation for losses and degradation in the various components and processes in the system. This covers the thermodynamic loss in chemical reactions, the wear and tear of larger parts, and the larger decline of components of the system in ageing. Living systems replace these losses by importing molecules from the outside environment, synthesizing new molecules and components, or creating new generations to start the system over again.\n\n\"Adaptability\" is the ability of a living system to respond to needs, dangers, or changes. It is distinguished from improvisation because the response is timely and does not involve a change of the program. Adaptability occurs from a molecular level to a behavioral level through feedback and feedforward systems. For example, an animal seeing a predator will respond to the danger with hormonal changes and escape behavior.\n\nY. N. Zhuravlev and V. A. Avetisov have analyzed Koshland's seven pillars from the context of primordial life and, though calling the concept \"elegant,\" point out that the pillars of compartmentalization, program, and seclusion don't apply well to the non-differentiated earliest life.\n\n"}
{"id": "56412457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56412457", "title": "Vaginal anomalies", "text": "Vaginal anomalies\n\nVaginal anomalies are abnormal structures that are formed (or not formed) during the prenatal development of the female reproductive system and are rare congenital defects that result in an abnormal or absent vagina. When present, they are often found with uterine, skeletal and urinary abnormalities. This is because these structures, like the vagina, are most susceptible to disruption during crucial times of organ-genesis. Many of these defects are classified under the broader term Mullerian duct anomalies. Mullerian duct anomalies are caused by a disturbance during the embryonic time of genitourinary development. The other isolated incidents of vaginal anomalies can occur with no apparent cause. Oftentimes vaginal anomalies are part of a cluster of defects or syndromes. In addition, inheritance can play a part as can prenatal exposure to some teratogens. Many vaginal anomalies are not detected at birth because the external genitalia appear to be normal. Other organs of the reproductive system may not be affected by an abnormality of the vagina. The uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries can be functional despite the presence of a defect of the vagina and external genitalia. A vaginal anomaly may not affect fertility. Though it depends on the extent of the vaginal defect, it is possible for conception to occur. In instances where a functional ovary exists, IVF may be successful. Functioning ovaries in a woman with a vaginal defect allows the implantation of a fertilized ovum into the uterus of an unaffected gestational carrier. A successful conception and can occur. Vaginal length varies from 6.5 to 12.5 cm. Since this is slightly shorter than older descriptions, it may impact the diagnosis of women with vaginal agenesis or hypoplasia who may unnecessarily be encouraged to undergo treatment to increase the size of the vagina. Vaginal anomalies may cause difficulties in urination, conception, pregnancy, impair sex. Psychosocial effects can also exist.\n\nSome anomalies are found upon examination shortly after birth or when the development of sexual characteristics does not progress as expected. Defects that prevent menstrual flow become obvious when amenorrhea occurs.\n\nSyndromes may take longer to identify since they are rare and often involve errors in metabolism. Many syndromes share the same signs and symptoms.\n\nThe cause of isolated cases of vaginal anomalies can not always be identified, though disruption of the embryonic development of the vagina likely plays a significant role.\n\nImaging studies are usually the most useful in diagnosing vaginal anomalies including retrograde contrast studies. An anomaly scan can be helpful, especially detecting the presence of a urogenital syndrome. Genetic and metabolic defects require further testing to support a diagnosis.\n\nVaginal anomalies are treated surgically. A 'neo-vagina' can be constructed for those girls and women who do not have a vagina. Vaginal septa are treated surgically.\n\nThe most common vaginal anomaly is an imperforate hymen. This anomaly occurs often enough that it can be detected by some pediatricians shortly after birth. Correction of an imperforate hymen may delayed until puberty. The hymen can be unusually thick or partially obstructed by the presence of fibrous bands of tissue. An imperforate hymen can also present with other abnormalities such as septa. An imperforate hymen can be displaced and its location may not be where it is expected. Other abnormalities of the hymen can exist including the presence of septa, displacement and a hymen that consists of microperforations. Uncommonly, a double hymen is present. The imperforate hymen is treated by excision and drainage. Sometimes a small border of hymenal tissue is left around the opening of the vagina.\n\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia can cause the abnormal development of the vagina. Vaginal adenosis is the abnormal presence of cervical and uterine tissue within the wall of the vagina. Ten percent of women have this condition and remain unsymptomatic. It rarely develops into a malignancy. Cloacal exstrophy is a condition when two vaginas are present. Vaginal agenesis or the complete absence of the vagina affects 1 out of 5,000 women. A hemivagina is the abnormal presence of a partial vagina that is attached to the wall of the functioning vagina. The hemivagina does not open to the normal vagina and is attached to an abnormal, second uterus. Vaginal hypoplasia is the under-development of the vagina and is found in instances of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Vaginal septa are structures consisting of fibrous tissue that block the vagina. The tissue extends horizontally, blocking or partially blocking the vaginal canal or transversly essentially creating two vaginas that connect to a normal uterus. Septa can prevent menstrual flow and result in painful intercourse, though some women do not have symptoms. Many vaginal anomalies are not detected at birth because the external genitalia can appear to be normal.\n\nSome congenital syndromes present with vaginal anomalies in association with other serious conditions. These include Fraser syndrome, WNT4 deficiency, and Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Isolated incidents of vaginal anomalies can occur with no apparent cause and in other instances these anomalies are part of a syndrome or cluster of other abnormalities. The origin of many vaginal anomalies is due to a disturbance during the embryonic stage of genitourinary development. Inheritance can play a part as can prenatal exposure to hormones and teratogens. Though the presence of a vaginal anomaly does not necessarily prevent conception and a successful pregnancy when a functional uterus and ovaries are present, vaginal anomalies increase the risk of miscarriage.\nPrenatal exposure to some hormones can cause vaginal anomalies as can the lack of necessary hormones needed for normal development. Diethylstilbestrol (DES), also known formerly (and inappropriately) as stilboestrol, is a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen and teratogen that can cause vaginal abnormalities in the developing embryo.\n\nUterine defects can accompany vaginal abnormalities:\nWomen with uterine abnormalities may have associated renal abnormalities including unilateral renal agenesis.\n\nThe occurrence of vaginal defects varies widely and some are only known from case studies. The prevalence of an imperforate hymen is 1 in 1000.\n\nNotable is the mention of vaginal anomalies and pelvic organ prolapse in older cultures and locations. In 1500 B.C. Egyptians wrote about the \"falling of the womb\". In 400 B.C. a Greek physician documented his observations and treatments:\n\n\"After the patient had been tied to a ladder-like frame, she was tipped upward so that her head was toward the bottom of the frame. The frame was then moved upward and downward more or less rapidly for approximately 3–5 min. As the patient was in an inverted position, it was thought that the prolapsing organs of the genital tract would be returned to their normal position by the force of gravity and the shaking motion.\"\n\nHippocrates also described the prolapse of other organs out through the vagina. In 1521, Berengario da Carpi performed the first surgical treatment for prolapse. This was to tie a rope around the prolapse, tighten it for two days until it was no longer viable and cut it off. Wine, aloe, and honey were then applied to the stump.\n\nReferences regarding the existence of vaginal anomalies related to müllerian defects have been traced back to 300 BC when a historian described a case of vaginal agenesis.\n\nIn 1823, other physicians proposed that vaginoplasy may provide treatment for pelvic organ prolapse. In 1830, the first dissection of the vagina was performed on a living woman. Other vaginal repairs were described in 1834 and treament sometimes the suturing the edges of a vaginal defect. In 1859 a solution to vaginal elongation was to remove the cervix. In 1866, methods that resembled those used today came into practice. Surgery on the anterior vaginal wall at this time did not have to involve full-thickness repairs to be successful. Sim subsequently developed another procedure that did not require the full-thickness dissection of the vaginal wall. Shortly after this time it was proposed that reattaching the vagina to support structures was more successful and resulted in less recurrence. This same proposal was proposed again in 1976 but further studies indicated that the recurrence rate was not better. Further advances in 1961 began when surgeons started to reattach of the anterior vaginal wall to Cooper's ligament.\n\nIn 1955, surgical mesh began to be used to strengthen pelvic tissue. In 1970, tissue from pigs began to be used to strengthen the anterior vaginal wall in surgery. Beginning in 1976, improvement in suturing began along with the surgical removal of the vagina being used to treat prolapse of the bladder. In 1991, assumptions about the detailed anatomy of the pelvic support structures began to be questioned regarding the existence of some pelvic structures and the non-existence of others. More recently, the use of stem cells, robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery are being used during vaginectomy and vaginoplasty.\n\n\n"}
