He is regarded as the immediate common patriarch of the Harari and the Somali Sheekhaal clan.\n\nAr-Rida is the main figure in the \"Fath Madinat Harar\", an unpublished history of Harar in the 13th century. According to the account, he along with several other religious leaders traveled from the Hijaz region of present-day Saudi Arabia to Harar in 612H (1216 AD). Ar-Rida subsequently married a Harari woman, and constructed the city's Jamia mosque.\n\nThe Somali Sheekhaal clan traces descent to Sheikh Abadir ar-Rida, also known as \"Fiqi Umar\". Ar-Rida in turn traced his lineage to the first caliph, Abu Bakr (Sayid Abubakar Al-Sadiq). According to the explorer Richard F. Burton, Fiqi Umar crossed over from the Arabian Peninsula to the Horn of Africa ten generations prior to 1854.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the son of `Abd al-Mannan, the nephew of `Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad, and the husband of Guisti (Harari \"princess\") Fatima, `Abd ar-Rahman's oldest daughter. He succeeded to the throne of Harar upon the death of `Abd ar-Rahman. \n\nFor a number of years in the 1830s, Abu Bakr campaigned against the neighboring Oromo with an armed force which the British explorer W. C. Barker described as \"consisting of from 150 to 200 matchlock men, 100 cavalry armed with long spears, 60 spearmen on foot, and a few archers. Insignificant, however, as this force really is, the matchlockmen alone render it far superior to that of the neighbouring tribes, who have a great dread of fire-arms; they have not even a single matchlock in their possession.\" Despite his military successes, by 1840 Harari merchants lamented that the neighboring Oromo were devastating the neighboring villages. The Harari were attacked in their fields within sight of the city walls in the middle of the day, and the city was spared in the end only by paying tribute. \n\nBurton alludes to the existence of communications between Emir Abu Bakr and the British governor of Aden. At the same time, there was tension between Harar and Hajj Sharmakay, ruler of Zeila; in response to the Emir's imprisonment of his agent in Harar, Hajj Sharmakay persuaded the son of Sahle Selassie, ruler of Shewa, to imprison about 300 citizens of Harar then resident in Shewa.\n\nBurton also mentions that Abu Bakr's vizier, or chief minister, was the treacherous Gerad Mohammed, who also served his son Ahmad. Burton had been told that, before his death, Abu Bakr had warned his son about the man.\n\nHe died on 8 July 1852 and was succeeded by his son Ahmad, who initially ruled under the regency of his mother Guisti Fatima, who was popular with the people of Harar.\n\n"}

He was a younger contemporary of Phidias and noted for the delicacy and finish of his works, among which a Hephaestus and an Aphrodite \"of the Gardens\" were conspicuous.\n\nPausanias says that he was the author of one of the pediments of the temple of Zeus at Olympia, but this seems a chronological and stylistic impossibility. Pausanias also refers to a statue of Ares by Alcamenes that was erected on the Athenian agora, which some have related to the Ares Borghese. However, the temple of Ares to which he refers had only been moved from Acharnes and re-sited in the Agora in Augustus's time, and statues known to derive from Alcamenes' statue show the god in a breastplate, so the identification of Alcamenes' Ares with the Ares Borghese is not secure.\n\nAt Pergamum there was discovered in 1903 a Hellenistic copy of the head of the Hermes \"Propylaeus\" of Alcamenes. As, however, the deity is represented in a Neo-Attic, archaistic and conventional character, this copy cannot be relied on as giving us much information as to the usual style of Alcamenes, who was almost certainly a progressive and original artist.\n\nIt is safer to judge him by the sculptural decoration of the Parthenon, in which he must almost certainly have taken a share under the direction of Phidias. He is said to be the most eminent sculptor in Athens after the departure of Phidias for Olympia, but enigmatic in that none of the sculptures associated with his name in classical literature can be securely connected with existing copies.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1137144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1137144", "title": "Antisense therapy", "text": "Antisense therapy\n\nAntisense therapy is a form of treatment for genetic disorders or infections. When the genetic sequence of a particular gene is known to be causative of a particular disease, it is possible to synthesize a strand of nucleic acid (DNA, RNA or a chemical analogue) that will bind to the messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by that gene and inactivate it, effectively turning that gene \"off\". This is because mRNA has to be single stranded for it to be translated. Alternatively, the strand might be targeted to bind a splicing site on pre-mRNA and modify the exon content of an mRNA.\n\nThis synthesized nucleic acid is termed an \"anti-sense\" oligonucleotide (AON) because its base sequence is complementary to the gene's messenger RNA (mRNA), which is called the \"sense\" sequence (so that a sense segment of mRNA \" 5'-AAGGUC-3' \" would be blocked by the anti-sense mRNA segment \" 3'-UUCCAG-5' \").\n\nAntisense oligonucleotides have been researched as potential drugs for diseases such as cancers (including lung cancer, colorectal carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, malignant glioma and malignant melanoma), diabetes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, Ataxia-telangiectasia (in vitro) and diseases such as asthma, arthritis and pouchitis with an inflammatory component. As of 2016, several antisense drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): fomivirsen as a treatment for cytomegalovirus retinitis, mipomersen for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, eteplirsen for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy.\n\nAs of 2012, some 40 antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs were in clinical trials, including over 20 in advanced clinical trials (Phase II or III).\n\nAlso in 2006, German physicians reported on a dose-escalation study for the compound AP 12009 (a phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide specific for the mRNA of human transforming growth factor TGF-beta2) in patients with high grade gliomas. At the time of the report, the median overall survival had not been obtained and the authors hinted at a potential cure.\n\nFomivirsen (marketed as Vitravene), was approved by the U.S. FDA in Aug 1998 as a treatment for cytomegalovirus retinitis.\n\nIn January 2013 mipomersen (marketed as Kynamro) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\nIn early 2006, scientists studying the Ebola hemorrhagic fever virus at USAMRIID announced a 75% recovery rate after infecting four rhesus monkeys and then treating them with an antisense Morpholino drug developed by Sarepta Therapeutics (formerly named AVI BioPharma), a U.S. biotechnology firm. The usual mortality rate for monkeys infected with Ebola virus is 100%. In late 2008, AVI BioPharma successfully filed Investigational New Drug (IND) applications with the FDA for its two lead products for Marburg and Ebola viruses. These drugs, AVI-6002 and AVI-6003 are novel analogs based on AVI's PMO antisense chemistry in which anti-viral potency is enhanced by the addition of positively charged components to the morpholino oligomer chain. Preclinical results of AVI-6002 and AVI-6003 demonstrated reproducible and high rates of survival in non-human primates challenged with a lethal infection of the Ebola and Marburg viruses, respectively.\n\nStarting in 2004, researchers in the US have been conducting research on using antisense technology to combat HIV.\n\nIn February 2010 researchers reported success in reducing HIV viral load using patient T-cells which had been harvested, modified with an RNA antisense strand to the HIV viral envelope protein, and re-infused into the patient during a planned lapse in retroviral drug therapy.\n\nIn 2004, development of an antisense therapy for spinal muscular atrophy was started. Over the following years, an antisense oligonucleotide later named nusinersen was developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals under a licensing agreement with Biogen. In December 2016, nusinersen received regulatory approval from FDA for use to treat spinal muscular atrophy.\n\nIn September 2016 eteplirsen, a Morpholino oligo, received FDA approval for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\nVolanesorsen is in phase 3 clinical trials for treating hypertriglyceridemia as of December 2016.\n\nBecause nucleases that cleave the phosphodiester linkage in DNA are expressed in almost every cell, unmodified DNA molecules are generally degraded before they reach their targets. Therefore, antisense drug candidate molecules are generally modified during the drug discovery phase of their development. Additionally, most targets of antisense are located inside cells, and getting nucleic acids across cell membranes is also difficult. Therefore, most clinical candidates have modified DNA \"backbones\", or the nucleobase or sugar moieties of the nucleotides are altered. Additionally, other molecules may be conjugated to antisense molecules in order to improve their ability to target certain cells or to cross barriers like cell membranes or the blood brain barrier.\n\n\n"}

The first, a 1989 Thanksgiving Day game in Dallas, was noted for allegations that the Eagles put a $200 bounty on Cowboys kicker Luis Zendejas, who had been cut by Philadelphia earlier that season. The second was a rematch held two weeks later in Philadelphia. The Eagles, favored to win both games, swept the series.\n\nThe Cowboys/Eagles rivalry had been increasingly heated since the 1986 season, with Buddy Ryan arriving as the Eagles' head coach; the next year, during the NFL players' strike, the Cowboys (who were playing with a number of players that crossed picket lines) routed an Eagles squad filled with replacement players; Ryan, believing that the Cowboys had run up the score in poor form, responded in kind in the second game when the strike was over. After the 1988 season, the Cowboys were sold to Jerry Jones, who proceeded to gut the team and fire longtime head coach Tom Landry in preparation for rebuilding.\nOn November 23, 1989, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Dallas Cowboys 27–0. Following the game, which was broadcast on CBS, Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson alleged that Ryan had taken out a bounty on two of the former's players, kicker Luis Zendejas and quarterback Troy Aikman: \n\nRyan denied the bounty accusation, saying that film of the game \"show that Small had no intention of hurting Zendejas.\" The Philadelphia coach asserted it would have been in the Eagles' best interests to keep Zendejas in the game because he was in a slump. Ryan also joked about Johnson's accusations: \n\nWhen the Cowboys and Eagles met on Thanksgiving 25 years later, on November 27, 2014, Johnson joked that Ryan put up the bounty offer to keep his players interested since the Cowboys, who ultimately went 1-15, were so bad that year.\n\nZendejas spoke of having seen <nowiki>\"Buddy call guys out and give them $100\"</nowiki> for what the kicker called a weekly Big Hit award but what Ryan called a Big Play award. This set of events set the stage for the scheduled rematch two weeks later in Philadelphia, dubbed \"Bounty Bowl II.\" As for the Eagles, they would not play another Thanksgiving game until the 2008 NFL season when the Eagles faced the Arizona Cardinals in a preview of that season's NFC Championship Game.\n\nThe second game in the series took place on December 10, 1989, with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue in attendance. The game was anticipated as a media event. CBS Sports did a pre-game opening touting the contest as \"Bounty Bowl II\", complete with wanted posters, the involved players' pictures, and bounty amounts.\n\nDuring the game, Eagles' fans threw snowballs, ice, and beer onto the field. Several game participants were targeted, including back judge Al Jury and Cowboys punter Mike Saxon (both struck by snowballs), as well as Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson, who was hit with objects as he was escorted off the field by the Philadelphia Police Department. Television announcers Verne Lundquist and Terry Bradshaw were also pelted with snowballs – Lundquist would claim on-air that a recent dental surgery had been less unpleasant than broadcasting a game in Philadelphia – and Eagles defensive lineman Jerome Brown was struck while standing on the sideline asking fans to cease throwing things.\n\nFuture Pennsylvania governor and Eagles fan Edward Rendell later admitted that he was involved in the incident. The then-former Philadelphia district attorney and future mayor of Philadelphia and governor of Pennsylvania bet another fan $20 that the latter couldn't reach the field with a snowball; Rendell lost.\n\nThe Eagles won the game 20–10. As a result of the incident, the Eagles added security and banned beer sales for their last home game of the year against the Phoenix Cardinals and the subsequent NFC wild-card playoff game versus the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nPorkchop Bowl\n\nA third game in the heated rivalry took place the next season, known as the \"Porkchop Bowl\". The game got its name because Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan choked on a pork chop in the week leading up to the game. Philadelphia won this game as well, 21–20. \n\nFurther coverage\n\nIn 2008 and on April 11, 2010, the game was included on a list of the ten most memorable moments in the history of Texas Stadium by ESPN.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7005392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7005392", "title": "Business Roundtable", "text": "Business Roundtable\n\nThe Business Roundtable (BRT) is a group of chief executive officers of major U.S. corporations formed to promote pro-business public policy.\n\nThe Roundtable was founded in 1972 by John Harper, the head of Alcoa, and Fred J. Borch, CEO of General Electric, who were concerned about growing public hostility toward corporations as evidenced by support for government regulation of the workplace environment and about the power of unions to squeeze corporate profits in an increasingly competitive international market. The two CEOs talked with John Connally, President Nixon's Secretary of the Treasury, and Arthur Burns, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who advised them to set up a lobbying organization that would specifically represent large banks and corporations. Harper was the first president, followed by Thomas Murphy of General Motors, Irving Shapiro of DuPont, and Clifford Garvin of Exxon. \n\nThe group was formed through the merger of three existing organizations: the March Group, consisting of chief executive officers who met informally to consider public policy issues; the Construction Users Anti-Inflation Roundtable, a group devoted to containing construction costs; and, the Labor Law Study Committee, largely made up of labor relations executives of major companies. The group has called itself President Obama's \"closest ally in the business community.\"\n\nThe Business Roundtable played a key role in defeating an anti-trust bill in 1975 and a Ralph Nader plan for a consumer protection agency in 1977. It also helped dilute the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act. But the Roundtable's most significant victory was in blocking labor law reform that sought to strengthen labor law to make it more difficult for companies to intimidate workers who wanted to form unions. The AFL-CIO produced a bill in 1977 that passed the House. But the Roundtable voted to oppose the bill, and through its aggressive lobbying, it prevented the bill's Senate supporters from rounding up the 60 votes in the Senate necessary to withstand a filibuster.\n\nIn fiscal policy, the Roundtable was responsible for broadening the 1985 tax cuts signed into law by Ronald Reagan, lobbying successfully for sharp reductions in corporate taxes. In trade policy, it argued for opening foreign markets to American trade and investment. The Omnibus Trade Act of 1988 reflected the thinking of the Business Roundtable. In 1990, the Roundtable urged George Bush to initiate a free trade agreement with Mexico. In 1993, the Roundtable lobbied for NAFTA and against any strong side agreements on labor and the environment. It provided the money and leadership for the main pro-NAFTA lobby.\n\nThe Roundtable also successfully opposed changes in corporate governance that would have made boards of directors and CEOs more accountable to stockholders. In 1986, the Roundtable convinced the Securities and Exchange Commission to forgo new rules on merger and acquisitions, and in 1993 convinced President Clinton to water down his plan to impose penalties on excessive executive salaries. Citicorp CEO, John Reed, chairperson of the Roundtables Accounting Task Force, argued that Clinton's plan would have had negative effects on U.S. competitiveness. The Roundtable's Health, Welfare, and Retirement Income Task Force, chaired by Prudential Insurance CEO Robert C. Winters, cheered President Bush's plan, which consisted mainly of subsidies to the health care industry. The nation's health care system works well for the majority of Americans, the Roundtable announced in a June 1991 statement. \"We believe the solutions lie not in tearing down the present system, but in building upon it.\"\n\nIn a press release, it said it \"strongly supported passage of\" the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, and was \"actively working with states on implementation.\" It has issued press releases, submitted editorials, given congressional testimony, and distributed position advertisements.\n\nThe Business Roundtable also acts as a major lobby that aims to extend or maintain administrators' rights/power in large companies. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted the so-called \"shareholders’ access to proxy\" rule, which aimed to empower shareholders in the proposition and nomination of administrators of big corporations. The Business Roundtable was strongly against that rule, as its president John Castellani reported to the \"Washington Post\" about removing this rule: \"this is our highest priority [...] Literally all of our members have called about this\". And they got the upper hand: the SEC rule was finally dropped after intense lobbying and lawsuits.\n\nThe Business Roundtable wrote a letter to members of the House strongly endorsing the Customer Protection and End User Relief Act (H.R. 4413; 113th Congress). According to the Business Roundtable letter, a survey of chief financial officers and corporate treasurers \"underscores the urgent need for the end-user provisions\" in this bill because \"eighty-six percent of respondents indicated the fully collateralizing over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives would adversely impact business investment, acquisitions, research and development, and job creation.\" The letter concluded that the Business Roundtable \"supports efforts to increase transparency in the derivatives markets and enhance financial stability for the U.S. economy through thoughtful new regulation while avoiding needless costs.\"\n\nThe Business Roundtable has been identified by advocates for shareholder democracy and owners' rights as a primary inhibitor of progress in corporate governance, who claim that through its lobbying of the SEC, the NYSE, and other regulatory and self-regulatory institutions, the Business Roundtable has sought to limit shareholders proxy rights and the power to nominate directors. The critics of the Business Roundtable contend that rather than fighting on behalf of stockholders in companies, it has focused purely on increasing executive power and compensation, thereby diminishing return to the owners (shareholders) of these firms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was created in 1996 in Kentucky to provide an alternative to the traditional religiously affiliated summer camps, for the children of nontheistic, humanist or freethinking families as well as children from a religious upbringing.\nCamp Quest currently consists of 13 affiliated camp groups and its current Executive Director is Kim Newton.\n\nIn 1995 Edwin Kagin, member of the Free Inquiry Group of Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky (FIG), conceived of the idea for a secular summer camp for children of nontheistic and atheist families, in response to the exclusion of non-religious children from the Boy Scouts of America. He formed a small committee of members of FIG with himself and Helen Kagin acting as directors and on August 11, 1996 the first camp took place in premises owned by Bullittsburg Baptist Church in Boone County, Kentucky with 20 children attending.\n\nIn 1999 Camp Quest moved to a nearby YMCA camp in Ohio, Camp Kern, at which the Northern Kentucky Baptist Association then sought the legal right to restrict the use of their campgrounds based on religious beliefs. At their request, then-Kentucky Representative Tom Kerr sponsored legislation (House Bill 70) exempting religious organizations from anti-discrimination requirements of public accommodation laws. His legislation was not successful and the bill was passed over in 2000.\n\nIn 2000 Camp Quest expanded with independent camps operating across the United States with the same mission statement, becoming Camp Quest Inc., an independent educational non-profit organization, in 2007 with Fred Edwords as its first president. Camp Quest Inc. now serves as an umbrella group for all Camp Quest affiliates in North America. Edwin and Helen Kagin continued as co-directors of the original Camp Quest based in Ohio until their retirement in 2005. The original Camp Quest moved to 4-H Camp Graham in Clarksville, Ohio, its current location.\n\nThe first affiliated group to begin operating a second Camp Quest summer camp session was the Rationalists of East Tennessee, which hosted its first camp session in Tennessee under the name Camp Quest of the Smoky Mountains in 2002.\n\nin 2009 Camp Quest expanded outside North America with Camp Quest UK launching in the United Kingdom. Current Camp Quest UK director, Samantha Stein, became a volunteer for the organisation at a camp in Michigan and was prompted to start a camp in the UK with a group of volunteers. The first UK camp was supported by a grant from the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, and was held in Somerset. Stein fielded a considerable amount of press interest when the Sunday Times broadsheet newspaper ran a front-page article on Camp Quest UK with the headline 'Dawkins sets up kids’ camp to groom atheists'. The Times later went on to include it in their \"Best kids camps in Britain\" and \"10 best kids' adventure holidays\". CQUK also received support from the Humanists UK.\n\nCamp Quest Norway launched in 2011 followed by Camp Quest Switzerland in 2013. Camp Quest Ireland was held as a two-day gathering in Dublin in 2010.\n\nThe camp's logo is based on original artwork by Edwin Kagin's daughter, Kathryn. The letters \"C\" and \"Q\" are combined into an infinity symbol. The name Quest is an acronym for Question, Understand, Explore, Search, Test. The camp's slogan is, \"Camp Quest. It's beyond belief!\" Camp Quest aims to provide a fun environment in which children can explore tasks using critical thinking and scientific reasoning as well as exploring ideas of ethics, mutual respect and democracy. The camp also exists to create a welcoming environment for non-religious children, who may otherwise feel excluded from church-based activities at home and religious summer camps, or want to feel confident to express spiritual or atheist beliefs with other children without disapproval. Camp Quest also welcomes children from any religious background. Camp Quest UK summarized their ethos, \"it's not a case of being told \" what\" to think about concepts such as God, just \"how\" to think\" about such concepts.\n\nMost camps' activities include traditional summer camp events: campfires, singing, crafts, games, swimming, canoeing and archery. Other activities explore science and nature and might include meteorology, astronomy, evolution or building rockets. Campers are also encouraged to explore mythology and philosophy, including discussing ethics in a camp version of Socrates Cafe. Campers might also learn American Sign Language, do drama or learn to build a radio. All the programs aim to introduce campers between the age of 8 and 17 to critical thinking, logic and freethought.\n\nAs of 2017 Camp Quest has expressed that it will not segregate activities by gender and has introduced policies to accommodate non binary gender and transgender campers and staff.\n\nDuring Camp Quest attendees are tasked with the invisible unicorn challenge, aimed at showing that a negative cannot be proven. The task is one of the ways used to encourage children to exercise logic and explore ideas about the burden of proof and challenges the children to prove that invisible unicorns do not exist. The children are told that two invisible unicorns exist at Camp Quest and that there is a valuable book proving their existence which has been passed from generation to generation but no one is allowed to read. Any camper who can prove that the unicorns do not exist will win a godless one-hundred dollar bill (issued before 1957, the year the U.S. Congress mandated that \"In God We Trust\" be printed on American fiat currency.) In the UK the prize is a £10 note signed by Richard Dawkins.

A member of the Torriani family, he was Archbishop of Milan from 1308 to 1316 and patriarch of Aquileia from 1317 to 1318.\n\nCassone was the second son of Corrado della Torre and grandson of Napo della Torre. In his youth, he stayed in Friuli, then ruled by his grand-uncle Raimondo as patriarch of Aquileia: here most members of the family lived in exile from Milan after their arch-rival House of Visconti had been able to seize the power in that city.\n\nCassone was appointed canon of Cividale in 1296. When the della Torre were able to return to Milan in 1302, Cassone was appointed canon of the Cathedral of Milan.\n\nIn 1308 he succeeded Francesco da Parma as Archbishop of Milan, being elected by the Chapterof the Cathedral, of Milan, confirmed by Pope Clemente V and consecrated bishop in Milano by Ugaccione Borromeo bishop of Novara on about 12 October 1308.\n\nHis appointment as Archbishop of Milano spurred a conflict with his cousin Guido della Torre, who was afraid that Cassone could ally with the Visconti against him (two of the archbishop's brothers were married to nephews of Matteo Visconti's wife). In 1309 he took part to a successful papal military expedition against the Republic of Venice, returning to Milan with great honors. On 1 October 1309 Guido's troops attacked the archbishop's palace in Milan, and imprisoned him. On 29 October 1309 he was exiled from Milan. He moved to Bologna where the papal legate excommunicated Guido della Torre.\n\nEmperor Henry VII appointed Cassone mediator between the claims of the families Torriani and Visconti who were in long conflict for ruling Milan. Cassone find an agreement between the two families but it was not accepted by Guido della Torre; Emperor Henry VII then forced Guido della Torre to flee from Milan and sold the title of imperial vicar for Milan to Matteo I Visconti. Cassone re-entered in Milan and on 6 January 1311 he crowned Henry VII as King of Italy. The debt due to the Emperor by the citizens of Milan created dissatisfaction and the Torriani instigated a revolt, which was suppressed by the Visconti, supported by the soldiers of the Emperor. Cassone then fled from Milan.\n\nOn 31 December 1316 Cassone renounced the title of See of Milan, and was appointed as secular patriarch of Aquileia by pope John XXIII. However, he never took the post Friuli since he died in a fall from horse at Florence. There he was buried in the church of Santa Florence; his funerary monument is attributed to Tino da Camaino or Agostino da Siena.\n"}
{"id": "2617132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2617132", "title": "Charcuterie", "text": "Charcuterie\n\nCharcuterie ( or ; northern or southern , from , and ) is the branch of cooking devoted to prepared meat products, such as bacon, ham, sausage, terrines, \"galantines\", \"ballotines\", \"pâtés\", and \"confit\", primarily from pork.\n\nCharcuterie is part of the \"garde manger\" chef's repertoire. Originally intended as a way to preserve meat before the advent of refrigeration, they are prepared today for their flavors derived from the preservation processes.\n\nThe French word for a person who prepares charcuterie is , generally translated as \"pork butcher\". This has led to the mistaken belief that charcuterie can only involve pork. The \"Food Lover's Companion\", however, says, \"it refers to the products, particularly (but not limited to) pork specialties such as , etc., which are made and sold in a delicatessen-style shop, also called a \"charcuterie\".\" The 1961 edition of \"Larousse Gastronomique\" defines it as \"[t]he art of preparing various meats, in particular pork, in order to present them in the most diverse ways.\"\n\nIn the first century AD, Strabo recorded the import of salted meat from Gaul and the Romans may have been the first to regulate the trade of \"charcuterie\" as they wrote laws regulating the proper production of pork joints, but the French have also had some influence. In 15th-century France, local guilds regulated tradesmen in the food production industry in each city. The guilds that produced \"charcuterie\" were those of the . The members of this guild produced a traditional range of cooked or salted and dried meats, which varied, sometimes distinctively, from region to region. The only \"raw\" meat the were allowed to sell was unrendered lard. The prepared numerous items, including \"pâtés\", \"rillettes\", sausages, bacon, trotters, and head cheese (brawn). These preservation methods ensured the meats would have longer shelf lives.\n\nForcemeat is a mixture of ground, lean meat emulsified with fat. The emulsification can be accomplished by grinding, sieving, or puréeing the ingredients. The emulsification may either be smooth or coarse in texture, depending on the desired consistency of the final product. Forcemeats are used in the production of numerous items found in \"charcuterie\". Meats commonly used in the production of forcemeats include pork, fish (pike, trout, or salmon), seafood, game meats (venison, boar, or rabbit), poultry, game birds, veal, and pork livers. Pork fatback is often used for the fat portion of forcemeat, as it has a somewhat neutral flavor.\n\nIn US usage, there are four basic styles of forcemeat. Straight forcemeats are produced by progressively grinding equal parts pork and pork fat with a third dominant meat which can be pork or another meat. The proteins are cubed and then seasoned, cured, rested, ground and then placed into desired vessel. Country-style forcemeats are a combination of pork, pork fat (often with the addition of pork liver) and garnish ingredients. The finished product has a coarse texture.\nThe third style is gratin, which has a portion of the main protein browned; the French term connotes a \"grated\" product that is browned. The final style is \"mousseline\", which are very light in texture using lean cuts of meat usually from veal, poultry, fish, or shellfish. The resulting texture comes from the addition of eggs and cream to this forcemeat.\n\nThe word \"sausage\" is derived through French from the Latin , as the sausage-making technique involves placing ground or chopped meat along with salt into a tube. The tubes can vary, but the more common animal-derived tubes include sheep, hog, or cattle intestinal linings. Additionally, animal stomachs and bladders, as well as edible artificial casings produced from collagen and inedible plant cellulose or paper are also used. Inedible casings are primarily used to shape, store, and age the sausage. The two main variants of sausage are fresh and cooked. Fresh sausages involve the production of raw meat placed into casings to be cooked at a later time, whereas cooked sausages are heated during production and are ready to eat at the end of production.\n\nEmulsified sausages are cooked sausages with a very fine texture, using the combination of pork, beef, or poultry with fat, salt, cure, flavorings, and water. These ingredients are emulsified at high speed in a food processor or blender. During this process, the salt dissolves the muscle proteins, which helps to suspend the fat molecules. Temperature is an important part of the process: if the temperature rises above 60 °F (16 °C) for pork or 70 °F (21 °C) for beef, the emulsion will not hold and fat will leak from the sausage during the cooking process.\n\n\"Pâté\" and \"terrines\" are often cooked in a pastry crust or an earthenware container. Both the earthenware container and the dish itself are called a terrine. \"Pâté\" and \"terrine\" are very similar: The term \"pâté\" often suggests a finer-textured forcemeat using liver, whereas terrines are more often made of a coarser forcemeat. The meat is chopped or ground, along with heavy seasoning, which may include fat and aromatics. The seasoning is important, as they will generally be served cold, which mutes the flavors.\n\nThe mixture is placed into a lined mold, covered, and cooked in a water bath to control the temperature, which will keep the forcemeat from separating, as the water bath slows the heating process of the terrine. \"Pâté\" and \"terrine\" are generally cooked to 160 °F (71 °C), while terrine made of foie gras are generally cooked to an internal temperature of 120 °F (59 °C). After the proper temperature is reached, the terrine is removed from the oven and placed into a cooling unit topped with a weight to compact the contents of the terrine. It is then allowed to rest for several days to allow the flavors to blend.\n\"Galantine\" is a chilled poultry product created after the French Revolution by the chef to the Marquis de Brancas. The term \"galant\" connotes urbane sophistication. Other origins are suggested: the older French word for chicken \"géline\" or \"galine\" or the word gelatin. Sources suggest the spelling of gelatin transformed into the words \"galentyne\", \"galyntyne\", \"galandyne\", and \"galendine\".\n\nThe galantine is prepared by skinning and boning a chicken or other poultry. The skin is laid flat, with the pounded breast laid on top. A forcemeat is then placed on top of the pounded breast. The galantine is then rolled with the ends of the breast meeting one another. The galantine is then wrapped in cheesecloth and poached in poultry stock until the proper internal temperature is reached.\n\n\"Roulade\" is similar to a \"galantine\". The two major differences are instead of rolling the poultry evenly for the ends of the breasts to meet, the bird is rolled into a pinwheel shape, and the roulade is cooled by chilling it after it has been removed from the poaching liquid.\n\nSalt serves four main purposes in the preservation of food in the charcuterie kitchen. The first is inducing osmosis: This process involves the movement of water outside of the membranes of the cells, which in turn reabsorb the salted water back into the cell. This process assists in the destruction of harmful pathogens. The second is dehydration, which means the salt pulls excess water from the protein, which aids in the shelf life of the protein, as there is less moisture present for bacterial growth. Fermentation is the third, in which salt assists in halting the fermentation process which would otherwise completely break the meat down. Finally, salt assists in denaturing proteins, which in essence means the structure of the proteins is effectively shifted, similar to the effects of cooking.\n\nBefore the discovery of nitrates and nitrites by German chemists around 1900, curing was done with unrefined salt and saltpeter. As saltpeter gives inconsistent results in preventing bacterial growth, nitrate and nitrite (in the forms of sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate) have increased in popularity for their consistent results. Nitrates take a considerably longer period of time to break down in cured foods than nitrites. Because of this, nitrates are the preferred curing salts for lengthy curing and drying periods. Nitrites are often used in foods that require a shorter curing time and are used for any item that will be fully cooked. Eventually, a portion of the nitrates will be converted into nitrites by bacterial action.\n\nNitrite has multiple purposes in the curing process. One purpose is flavor, the nitrites giving a sharp, piquant flavor to the meat. Second, the nitrites react with substances in the meat to produce nitric oxide. Nitric oxide prevents iron from breaking down the fat in the meat, thus halting rancidity. The binding also creates the characteristic reddish color found in most cured meat. Finally, the nitrite inhibits the growth of botulism-causing organisms that would ordinarily thrive in the oxygen-deprived environment in the sausage casing. German scientists originally named botulism poisoning (\"sausage poisoning\"). The term \"\" derives its name from the Latin term for sausage.\n\nEating cured meat products has been linked to a small increase in gastric cancer, as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The negative effects are presumed to be caused by nitrates and nitrites, as well as nitrosamines which are formed by nitrites reacting with meat. These risks are generally regarded as minimal, and regulations in the United States limit ingoing nitrites to 156 parts per million (0.0156%) (less for bacon) as a precautionary measure.\n\nTwo main types of curing salt mixture are used by the charcutier. The first is known by multiple names, including \"tinted cure mix\", \"pink cure\", \"prague powder\", or \"insta-cure #1\". The mixture is 93.75% sodium chloride and 6.25% sodium nitrite. When used, the recommended amount is a ratio of 4 oz for each 100 lb (1 kg for each 400 kg) of meat or 0.25% of the total weight of the meat. This blend is colored bright pink to keep the charcutier from confusing the mixture with regular salt.\n\nThe second curing salt blend is called \"prague powder II\" or \"insta-cure #2\". Also colored pink to differentiate it from table salt, it contains 6.25% sodium nitrite, 4% sodium nitrate, and 89.75% table salt.. This mixture is used for dry sausages that require a longer drying period which requires the presence of nitrate.\n\nSweeteners and other flavoring agents are necessary in the production of many cured products due to the harsh flavors of the salt. A number of sweeteners can be used in curing foods, including dextrose, sugar, corn syrup, honey, and maple syrup. Dextrose is seen often in cured meat, as it not only mellows the harshness, but it also increases the moisture content of the cured product while adding less sweetness to the cured meat. The sweeteners also assist in stabilizing the colors in meat and help the fermentation process by giving a nutrient to the bacteria.\n\nNumerous spices and herbs are used in the curing process to assist with the flavor of the final product. The sweet spices regularly used include cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, mace, and cardamom. Other flavoring agents may include dried and fresh chilies, wine, fruit juice, or vinegar.\n\nFermented sausages are created by salting chopped or ground meat to remove moisture, while allowing beneficial bacteria to break down sugars into flavorful molecules. Bacteria, including \"Lactobacillus\" species and \"Leuconostoc\" species, break down these sugars to produce lactic acid, which not only affects the flavor of the sausage, but also lowers the pH from 6.0 to 4.5–5.0, preventing the growth of bacteria that could spoil the sausage. These effects are magnified during the drying process, as the salt and acidity are concentrated as moisture is extracted.\n\nThe ingredients found in a fermented sausage include meat, fat, bacterial culture, salt, spices, sugar and nitrite. Nitrite is commonly added to fermented sausages to prevent the formation of botulism-causing bacteria, while some traditional and artisanal producers avoid nitrites. Sugar is added to aid the bacterial production of lactic acid during the 18-hour to three-day fermentation process; the fermentation time depends on the temperature at which the sausage is stored: the lower the temperature, the longer the required fermentation period. A white mold and yeast sometimes adheres to the outside of the sausage during the drying process. This mold adds to the flavor of the sausage and aids in preventing harmful bacteria from attaching to the sausage.\n\nThe two main types of fermented sausage are the dry, salted, spiced sausages found in warmer climates and fermented semidry sausages found in cooler, more humid climates. Since the dry sausages of the Mediterranean, in countries such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal contain 25–35% water and more than 4% salt, they may be stored at room temperature. The sausages of northern Europe usually contain less salt (around 3%) and 40–50% water, and as such do not dry well in the humid climate of countries such as Germany.\n\n\n\n"}

Except in this verse of 1 Corinthians, where it uses \"grave\", the King James Version translates \"ᾅδης\" as \"hell\". Modern translations, for which there are only 10 instances of the word \"ᾅδης\" in the New Testament, generally transliterate it as \"Hades\". \n\nIn all appearances but one, \"ᾅδης\" has little if any relation to afterlife rewards or punishments. The one exception is Luke's parable of Lazarus and the rich man, in which the rich man finds himself, after death, in Hades, and \"in anguish in this flame\", while in contrast the angels take Lazarus to \"the bosom of Abraham\", described as a state of comfort. \n\nDeath and Hades are repeatedly associated in the Book of Revelation. The word \"Hades\" appears in Jesus' promise to Peter: \"And I also say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it\", and in the warning to Capernaum: \"And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades.\"\n\nIn English usage the word \"Hades\" first appears around 1600, as a transliteration of the Greek word \"ᾅδης\" in the line in the Apostles' Creed, \"He descended into hell\", the place of waiting (the place of \"the spirits in prison\" ) into which Jesus is there affirmed to have gone after the Crucifixion. Because this descent, known in Old and Middle English as the Harrowing of Hell, needed to be distinguished from what had come to be more usually called \"hell\", i.e. the place or state of those finally damned, the word was transliterated and given a differentiated meaning.\n\nThis development whereby \"hell\" came to be used to mean only the \"hell of the damned\" affected also the Latin word \"infernum\" and the corresponding words in Latin-derived languages, as in the name \"Inferno\" given to the first part of Dante's \"Divina Commedia\". Greek, on the other hand, has kept the original meaning of \"ᾅδης\" (Hades) and uses the word \"\" (\"kólasis\" – literally, \"punishment\"; cf. , which speaks of \"everlasting \"kolasis\"\") to refer to what nowadays is usually meant by \"hell\" in English.\n\nMost mainstream Christian denominations and churches believe in some form of conscious existence after the death of the body.\n\nThe teaching of the Eastern Orthodox Church is that, \"after the soul leaves the body, it journeys to the abode of the dead (Hades). There are exceptions, such as the Theotokos, who was borne by the angels directly into heaven. As for the rest, we must remain in this condition of waiting. Because some have a prevision of the glory to come and others foretaste their suffering, the state of waiting is called \"Particular Judgment\". When Christ returns, the soul rejoins its risen body to be judged by Him in the Last judgment. The 'good and faithful servant' will inherit eternal life, the unfaithful with the unbeliever will spend eternity in hell. Their sins and their unbelief will torture them as fire.\"\n\nThe Church of the East, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church, hold that a final Universal Judgment will be pronounced on all human beings when soul and body are reunited in the resurrection of the dead. They also believe that the fate of those in the abode of the dead differs, even while awaiting resurrection: \"The souls of the righteous are in light and rest, with a foretaste of eternal happiness; but the souls of the wicked are in a state the reverse of this.\"\n\nThe Latin word \"infernus\" or \"infernum\" (underworld) indicated the abode of the dead and so was used as the equivalent of the Greek word \"ᾅδης\" (hades). It appears in both the documents quoted above, and pointed more obviously than the Greek word to an existence beneath the earth. Later, the transliteration \"hades\" of the Greek word ceased to be used in Latin and \"infernum\" became the normal way of expressing the idea of Hades. Though \"infernus\" is usually translated into English as \"hell\", it did not have the narrow sense that the English word has now acquired. It continued to have the generic meaning of \"abode of the dead\". For the modern narrow sense the term \"infernum damnatorum\" (hell of the damned) was used, as in question 69, article 7 of the Supplement of the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas, which distinguishes five states or abodes of the dead: paradise, hell of the damned, limbo of children, purgatory, and limbo of the Fathers: \"The soul separated from the body is in the state of receiving good or evil for its merits; so that after death it is either in the state of receiving its final reward, or in the state of being hindered from receiving it. If it is in the state of receiving its final retribution, this happens in two ways: either in the respect of good, and then it is paradise; or in respect of evil, and thus as regards actual sin it is hell, and as regards original sin it is the limbo of children. On the other hand, if it be in the state where it is hindered from receiving its final reward, this is either on account of a defect of the person, and thus we have purgatory where souls are detained from receiving their reward at once on account of the sins they have committed, or else it is on account of a defect of nature, and thus we have the limbo of the Fathers, where the Fathers were detained from obtaining glory on account of the guilt of human nature which could not yet be expiated.\"\n\n\"The Anglican Catechist\" states that \"there is an intermediate state between death and the resurrection, in which the soul does not sleep in unconsciousness, but exists in happiness or misery till the resurrection, when it shall be reunited to the body and receive its final reward.\" John Henry Hobart, an Anglican bishop, writes that \"Hades, or the place of the dead, is represented as a spacious \"receptacle\" with gates, through which the dead enter.\" This space is divided into Paradise and Gehenna \"but with an impassable gulf between the two\". Souls, with exception of martyrs and saints, remain in Hades until the Final Judgment and \"Christians may also improve in holiness after death during the middle state before the final judgment\". As such, many Anglicans pray for the dead.\n\nIn the Methodist Church, \"\"hades\" denotes the intermediate state of souls between death and the general resurrection,\" which is divided into Paradise (for the righteous) and Gehenna (for the wicked). After the general judgment, \"hades\" will be abolished. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, \"made a distinction between hell (the receptacle of the damned) and hades (the receptacle of all separate spirits), and also between paradise (the antechamber of heaven) and heaven itself.\" The dead will remain in Hades \"until the Day of Judgment when we will all be bodily resurrected and stand before Christ as our Judge. After the Judgment, the Righteous will go to their eternal reward in Heaven and the Accursed will depart to Hell (see ).\"\n\nJohn Calvin held that the intermediate state is conscious and that the wicked suffer in hell.\n\nSeveral groups of Christians believe in Christian mortalism or \"soul sleep\" and in general judgment (\"Last Judgment\") only. Denominations that see the dead in the intermediate state as not having consciousness include early Unitarians, Christian Universalists, Christadelphians, Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses. These groups also believe that Christ too was dead, unconscious and \"asleep\" during his time in the grave.\n\nThe views of Lutherans and Anglicans vary. Martin Luther himself appears inconsistent in his views though generally maintained that souls remained asleep until the resurrection whereupon hell awaited the condemned.\n\nThe Church of England has a variety of views on the death state. Some, such as N. T. Wright have proposed a view of the grave which considers Hades to be a place where the dead sleep, and E. W. Bullinger argued for the cessation of the soul between death and resurrection.\n\nSome Christians believe in the soul's \"mortality\" (\"Christian mortalism\" or \"soul sleep\") and general judgment (\"Last Judgment\") only. This view is held by some Anglicans such as E. W. Bullinger. Proponents of the mortality of the soul, and general judgment, for example Advent Christians, Conditionalists, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Christadelphians, and Christian Universalists, argue that the story of the rich man and Lazarus is a parable using the framework of Jewish views of the Bosom of Abraham, and is metaphorical, and is not definitive teaching on the intermediate state for several reasons. After being emptied of the dead, Hades and death are thrown into the lake of fire in .\n\nTertullian (c. 160 – c. 225), making an exception only for the martyrs, argued that the souls of the dead go down beneath the earth, and will go up to the sky (heaven) only at the end of the world: \"You must suppose Hades to be a subterranean region, and keep at arm's length those who are too proud to believe that the souls of the faithful deserve a place in the lower regions … How, indeed, shall the soul mount up to heaven, where Christ is already sitting at the Father's right hand, when as yet the archangel's trumpet has not been heard by the command of God, when as yet those whom the coming of the Lord is to find on the earth, have not been caught up into the air to meet Him at His coming, in company with the dead in Christ, who shall be the first to arise? … The sole key to unlock Paradise is your own life's blood.\".\n\nThe variously titled fragment \"Against Plato\" or \"De Universo\", attributed to Hippolytus of Rome (c. 170 – c. 236), has the following: \"And this is the passage regarding demons. But now we must speak of Hades, in which the souls both of the righteous and the unrighteous are detained. Hades is a place in the created system, rude, a locality beneath the earth, in which the light of the world does not shine; and as the sun does not shine in this locality, there must necessarily be perpetual darkness there. This locality has been destined to be as it were a guard-house for souls, at which the angels are stationed as guards, distributing according to each one's deeds the temporary punishments for characters. And in this locality there is a certain place set apart by itself, a lake of unquenchable fire, into which we suppose no one has ever yet been cast; for it is prepared against the day determined by God, in which one sentence of righteous judgment shall be justly applied to all. And the unrighteous, and those who believed not God, who have honoured as God the vain works of the hands of men, idols fashioned, shall be sentenced to this endless punishment. But the righteous shall obtain the incorruptible and un-fading kingdom, who indeed are at present detained in Hades, but not in the same place with the unrighteous.\"\n\nIn his study, \"Hades of Hippolytus or Tartarus of Tertullian? The Authorship of the Fragment \"De Universo\"\", C. E. Hill argues that the depiction of the intermediate state of the righteous expounded in this text is radically opposed to that found in the authentic works of Hippolytus and must have been written by Tertullian.\n\n\n"}

He then went up to Exeter College, Oxford where he won blues for football in 1879, 1880 and 1881.\n\nWilson was called into the England team for their first ever meeting with Wales. The match was played at the Kennington Oval on 18 January 1879 in a blizzard. Due to the atrocious snowfall both captains agreed to play halves of only 30 minutes each. The poor attendance (reports range from 85 to 300) was also attributed to the weather. Some sources suggest that William Clegg turned up 20 minutes late for the game. Clegg, a solicitor, was working late on a case (the trial of Charles Peace, the Banner Cross murderer) and was unable to leave Sheffield for London on the Friday night. The next morning, the southbound train with Clegg on it, was delayed by heavy snow. The match started without Clegg and England played with ten men until he arrived. Despite this, England won the match by two goals to one, with Herbert Whitfeld and Thomas Sorby scoring for England.\n\nIn 1880, he was part of the Oxford University team that reached the FA Cup Final, where they met the previous year's losing finalists, Clapham Rovers. This was the university's fourth appearance in the Cup Final since the Cup was inaugurated in 1872, and, having \"conquered much-fancied Nottingham Forest in the semi-final\" were favourites to take the trophy. In the event, the Rovers defence were able to keep the university forwards at bay, and with Wilson and his fellow full-back Robert King tiring towards the end of the second half, and the prospect of extra time imminent, Francis Sparks \"made a clever run down the wing, crossed to the waiting Clopton Lloyd-Jones who had the simple task of slotting the ball between the Oxford goalposts to secure a one-goal lead.\" This was the last appearance in an FA Cup Final for both teams.\n\nHis second England call-up came for the match against Scotland on 12 March 1881, in which England went down to a \"humiliating\" 6–1 defeat, with Scotland's goals including a hat-trick from John Smith and two from George Ker.\n\nWilson also played for the Old Brightonians and represented Sussex. He was described by Charles Alcock in his 1882 \"Football Annual\" as \"a splendid back; strong kick; very fast and active; his unexpected demise, in June, was deeply regretted by all who knew him\".\n\nWilson also played cricket at first-class level. He played in one match for the University against the Gentlemen of England in June 1881, when he scored 51 in the university's second innings in a drawn match.\n\nImmediately after this match, he played for Surrey against Gloucestershire. In this match, in which he was the wicketkeeper, he was dismissed LBW to W. G. Grace, who led his team to a victory by 8 wickets.\n\nIn June 1881, he caught sunstroke during a cricket match and subsequently died at Betchworth, Surrey on 29 June.\n\nOxford University\n\n"}

{"id": "13030638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13030638", "title": "Cognitive module", "text": "Cognitive module\n\nA cognitive module is, in theories of the modularity of mind and the closely related society of mind theory, a specialised tool or sub-unit that can be used by other parts to resolve cognitive tasks. The question of their existence and nature is a major topic in cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. Some see cognitive modules as an independent part of the mind. Others also see new thought patterns achieved by experience as cognitive modules.\n\nOther theories similar to the \"cognitive module\" are \"cognitive description\", \"cognitive pattern\" and \"psychological mechanism\". Such a mechanism, if created by evolution, is known as \"evolved psychological mechanism\".\n\nSome examples of cognitive modules:\n\nMany common psychological and personality disorders are caused by cognitive modules running amok.\n\nJealousy: A common cause of unnecessary conflict in relations is that a man is jealous of a woman's previous sexual partners before she met him. All people are born with a basic jealousy cognitive module, developed through as evolutionary strategy in order to safeguard a mate and trigger aggression towards competitors to ensure paternity and prevent bastards. If this module is activated to too strong a degree, it becomes a personality disorder.\n\nStalking: An extreme psychological disorder related to jealousy is stalking. A stalker is a person (usually a man) who behaves as if he had a relation to another person (usually a woman) who is not interested in him. There are also women who stalk men, men who stalk men and women who stalk women, but most common is a man stalking a woman. In modern western culture this behaviour is strongly frowned upon.\n\nParanoia: Being suspicious of fellow human beings is a trait to safeguard against perceived, secret plots against us, a basic human cognitive module useful for survival. But in some people, this turns into unreasonable suspiciousness where there is in reality no plotting against one. Such behaviour is by psychiatrists labeled as \"paranoid schizophrenia\" or in milder forms as \"paranoid personality disorder\". These disorders thus occur when the suspiciousness cognitive module is triggered too often and too strongly for triggers that would not trigger this module in normal people.\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder: In this quite common disorder, a person will repeatedly check, for example, that a door is locked. One may repeatedly wash hands or other body parts, sometimes for hours, to ensure cleanliness. Again, this disorder is a malfunction of a normal adaptation in all humans to check that a door is locked, to wash to keep us clean, etc.\n\nTransference: A cognitive module developed to solve a particular problem can sometimes crop up in other situations where it is not appropriate. One may be angry at one's boss, but take the anger out on one's fellow man. Often, the transference is unconscious (see also Subconscious mind and Unconscious mind). In psychotherapy, the patient is made aware of this, which makes it easier to modify the unsuitable behaviour.\n\nSigmund Freud's theory of sublimation: said that cognitive modules for some activities, such as sex, may incorrectly show up in disguise in cases where they are not suitable. Freud also introduced the idea of the unconscious, which interpreted as cognitive modules where a person is not aware of the initial cause of these modules and may use them inappropriately.\n\nSchizophrenia: is a psychotic disorder where cognitive modules are triggered too often, overwhelming the brain with information. The inability to repress overwhelming information is a cause of schizophrenia.\n\nCognitive therapy is a psychotherapeutic method that helps people better understand the cognitive modules that cause them to do certain things, and to teach them alternative, more appropriate cognitive modules to use instead in the future.\n\nAccording to psychoanalytic theory, many cognitive modules are unconscious and repressed, to avoid mental conflicts. \"Defenses\" are meant to be cognitive modules used to suppress the awareness of other cognitive modules. Unconscious cognitive modules may influence our behaviour without our being aware of it.\n\nIn the research field of evolutionary psychology it is believed that some cognitive modules are inherited and some are created by learning, but the creation of new modules by learning is often guided by inherited modules.\n\nFor example, the ability to drive a car or throw a basketball are certainly learned and not inherited modules, but they may make use of inherited modules to rapidly compute trajectories.\n\nThere is some disagreement between different social scientists on the importance to the capabilities of the human mind of inherited modules. Evolutionary psychologists claim that other social scientists do not accept that some modules are partially inherited, other social scientists claim that evolutionary psychologists are exaggerating the importance of inherited cognitive modules.\n\nA very important aspect of how humans think is the ability, when encountering a situation or problem, to find more or less similar, but not identical, experiences or cognitive modules. This can be compared to what happens if you sound a tone near a piano. The piano string corresponding to this particular tone will then vibrate. But also other strings, from nearby strings, will vibrate to a lesser extent.\n\nExactly how the human mind does this is not known, but it is believed that when you encounter a situation or problem, many different cognitive modules are activated at the same time, and the mind selects those most useful for understanding a new situation or solving a new problem.\n\nMost law-abiding people have cognitive modules that stop them from committing crimes. Criminals have different modules, causing criminal behaviour. Thus, cognitive modules can be a cause of both ethical and unethical behaviour.\n\n\nThis article is based on an article in Web4Health.\n"}

{"id": "523737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=523737", "title": "Egg incubation", "text": "Egg incubation\n\nIncubation refers to the process by which certain oviparous (egg-laying) animals hatch their eggs; it also refers to the development of the embryo within the egg. Multiple and various factors are vital to the incubation of various species of animal. In many species of reptile for example, no fixed temperature is necessary, but the actual temperature determines the sex ratio of the offspring. In birds in contrast, the sex of offspring is genetically determined, but in many species a constant and particular temperature is necessary for successful incubation. Especially in poultry, the act of sitting on eggs to incubate them is called brooding. The action or behavioral tendency to sit on a clutch of eggs is also called broodiness, and most egg-laying breeds of poultry have had this behavior selectively bred out of them to increase production.\n\nA wide range of incubation habits is displayed among birds. In warm-blooded species such as bird species generally, body heat from the brooding parent provides the constant temperature, though several groups, notably the megapodes, instead use heat generated from rotting vegetable material, effectively creating a giant compost heap while crab plovers make partial use of heat from the sun. The Namaqua sandgrouse of the deserts of southern Africa, needing to keep its eggs cool during the heat of the day, stands over them drooping its wings to shade them. The humidity is also critical, because if the air is too dry the egg will lose too much water to the atmosphere, which can make hatching difficult or impossible. As incubation proceeds, an egg will normally become lighter, and the air space within the egg will normally become larger, owing to evaporation from the egg.\n\nIn the species that incubate, the work is divided differently between the sexes. Possibly the most common pattern is that the female does all the incubation, as in the Atlantic canary and the Indian robin, or most of it, as is typical of falcons. In some species, such as the whooping crane, the male and the female take turns incubating the egg. In others, such as the cassowaries, only the male incubates. The male mountain plover incubates the female's first clutch, but if she lays a second, she incubates it herself. In hoatzins, some birds (mostly males) help their parents incubate later broods.\n\nThe incubation period, the time from the start of uninterrupted incubation to the emergence of the young, varies from 11 days (some small passerines and the black-billed and yellow-billed cuckoos) to 85 days (the wandering albatross and the brown kiwi). In these latter, the incubation is interrupted; the longest uninterrupted period is 64 to 67 days in the emperor penguin. In general smaller birds tend to hatch faster, but there are exceptions, and cavity nesting birds tend to have longer incubation periods. It can be an energetically demanding process, with adult albatrosses losing as much as 83 g of body weight a day. Megapode eggs take from 49 to 90 days depending on the mound and ambient temperature. Even in other birds, ambient temperatures can lead to variation in incubation period. Normally the egg is incubated outside the body. However, in one recorded case, the egg incubation occurred entirely within a chicken. The chick hatched inside and emerged from its mother without the shell, leading to internal wounds that killed the mother hen.\n\nEmbryo development remains suspended until the onset of incubation. The freshly laid eggs of domestic fowl, ostrich, and several other species can be stored for about two weeks when maintained under 5 C. Extended periods of suspension have been observed in some marine birds. Some species begin incubation with the first egg, causing the young to hatch at different times; others begin after laying the second egg, so that the third chick will be smaller and more vulnerable to food shortages. Some start to incubate after the last egg of the clutch, causing the young to hatch simultaneously.\n\nIncubation periods for birds\n\nVery few mammals lay eggs. In perhaps the best known example, the platypus, the eggs develop \"in utero\" for about 28 days, with only about 10 days of external incubation (in contrast to a chicken egg, which spends about one day in tract and 21 days externally). After laying her eggs, the female curls around them. The incubation period is divided into three phases. In the first phase, the embryo has no functional organs and relies on the yolk sac for sustenance. The yolk is absorbed by the developing young. During the second phase, the digits develop. In the last phase, the egg tooth appears. The only other egg-laying mammal is the echidna. New science research has been found that eggshells have a nanostructure that has inner and outer layers. The structure of this shell contains a protein known as osteopontin which is also found in tooth and bone. What reachers found was that the inner layers of the shell were thinner than the outer shells. This is because in the process of the egg being incubated the chicken embryos are taking the protein from the shell making the chicks skeleton stronger. \n\nMethods of incubation vary widely among the many different kinds of reptiles.\n\nVarious species of sea turtles bury their eggs on beaches under a layer of sand that provides both protection from predators and a constant temperature for the nest.\n\nSnakes may lay eggs in communal burrows, where a large number of adults combine to keep the eggs warm.\n\nAlligators and crocodiles either lay their eggs in mounds of decomposing vegetation or lay them in holes they dig in the ground.\n\nFish generally do not incubate their eggs. However, some species mouthbrood their eggs, not eating until they hatch.\n\nSome amphibians brood their eggs. The female salamander \"Ensatina\" (\"Ensatina eschscholtzii\") curls around the clutch of eggs and massages individual eggs with her pulsating throat. Some aquatic frogs such as the Surinam toad (\"Pipa pipa\") have pouches in their skin into which the eggs are inserted. Other neotropical frogs in the family Hemiphractidae also have pouches in which the eggs develop, in some species directly into juvenile frogs and in others into tadpoles that are later deposited in small water bodies to continue their development. The male Darwin's frog carries the eggs around in his mouth until metamorphosis, and the female stomach-brooding frog of Australia swallows the eggs, which develop in her stomach.\n\nBrooding occurs in some invertebrates when the fertilised eggs are retained inside or on the surface of the parent, usually the mother. This happens in some cnidarians (sea anemones and corals), a few chitons, some gastropod molluscs, some cephalopods, some bivalve molluscs, many arthropods, some entoproctans, some brachiopods, some bryozoans, and some starfish.\n\n\n\n"}

November 4, 1962) was the second chimpanzee launched into space by NASA. He was the first chimpanzee, and third hominid after cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov, to achieve Earth orbit. Enos' flight occurred on November 29, 1961.\n\nEnos was brought from the Miami Rare Bird Farm on April 3, 1960. He completed more than 1,250 training hours at the University of Kentucky and Holloman Air Force Base. Training was more intense for him than for his predecessor Ham, because Enos was exposed to weightlessness and higher \"g\"s for longer periods of time. His training included psychomotor instruction and aircraft flights.\n\nEnos was selected for flight only three days before launch. Two months prior, NASA launched Mercury Atlas 4 on September 13, 1961, to conduct an identical mission with a \"crewman simulator\" on board. Enos flew into space aboard Mercury Atlas 5 on November 29, 1961. He completed his first orbit in 1 hour and 28.5 minutes.\n\nEnos was scheduled to complete three orbits, but the mission was aborted after two due to two issues: capsule overheating and a malfunctioning \"avoidance conditioning\" test subjecting the primate to 76 electrical shocks. The capsule was brought aboard the USS \"Stormes\" (DD-780) in the late afternoon and Enos was immediately taken below deck by his Air Force handlers. The \"Stormes\" arrived in Bermuda the next day.\n\nEnos's flight was a full dress rehearsal for the next Mercury launch on February 20, 1962, which would make John Glenn the first American to orbit Earth, after astronauts Alan Shepard, Jr. and Gus Grissom's successful suborbital space flights. On November 4, 1962, Enos died of shigellosis-related dysentery, which was resistant to then-known antibiotics. He was constantly observed for two months before his death. Pathologists reported no symptoms that could be attributed or related to his previous space flight. Many believe Enos's remains were dissected like Ham, who was extensively studied postmortem at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Some of Ham's remains, minus the skeleton (which remained with AIP), were buried at the International Space Hall of Fame in New Mexico. Recent attempts by space scholars to locate Enos's remains were unsuccessful. Post-mortem study was undertaken. His remains were then packed and sent to the Smithsonian Institute according to Dr. James E. Cook Veterinary Pathologist who was involved in Enos' autopsy and was also the Head of the Chimp Consortium at Holloman AFB at the time of Enos' death.\n\n\n"}

No trace of the two vessels have ever been found. 76 French sailors and two Canadian captains disappeared along with the minesweepers. \"Inkerman\" and \"Cerisoles\" are the last warships to disappear on the Great Lakes, and their sinkings caused the largest loss of life of any Lake Superior shipwreck.\n\n\"Inkerman\" and \"Cerisoles\" were s, designed to clear naval mines in the English Channel. Built at the Canada Car and Foundry Company in what was then known as Fort William, Ontario, the vessels were long, and displaced 630 tons. Their steel-framed wooden hulls were divided into four water-tight compartments. Each ship was fitted with twin screws and a single funnel, and had a top speed of about . Two deck guns, with a range of about , were located forward and aft. It was rumored that because of the end of World War I, construction funds were cut short and wooden plugs took the place of metal rivets in the minesweepers, which could have led to their demise. A sister ship called \"Sebastopol\" was built alongside \"Inkerman\" and \"Cerisoles\", and almost sank during its maiden voyage.\n\nFrench naval documents refer to the ships as \"chalutiers\" not \"drageurs de mines.\" This is because the ships were designed to function as fishing trawlers after the war.\n\nIn the middle of November 1918, the three minesweepers \"Inkerman\", \"Cerisoles\", and \"Sebastopol\" left the harbour of Fort William, Ontario, on the northern shore of Lake Superior, headed for the Atlantic Ocean via the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. 76 French sailors made up the crews of \"Inkerman\" and \"Cerisoles\", with the addition of two veteran Canadian captains, Capt. R. Wilson and W.J. Murphy. As the ships steamed further into Lake Superior, they encountered a blizzard with recorded winds of and waves high. All three ships soon lost sight of each other through the snow and waves. The storm was so bad that a sailor aboard \"Sebastopol\" said \"We had to get out the life boats and put on lifebelts ... the boat almost sank – and it was nearly 'goodbye' to anyone hearing from us again ... You can believe me, I will always remember that day. I can tell you that I had already given myself up to God.\" Water poured into \"Sebastopol\", flooding part of her engine room and nearly putting out the coal fires in her boilers. The storm pounded \"Sebastopol\" for two days but the vessel managed to reach Sault Ste. Marie, at the eastern end of Lake Superior. What soon became apparent was that \"Inkerman\" and \"Cerisoles\" were nowhere to be found. As days passed, rumours spread that the warships sailed through the locks unnoticed all the way to the St. Lawrence River, but it was assumed the ships were lost. On 3 December 1918, ten days after the three ships left Fort William, a search effort was launched, but because of wartime censorship it was small and the public was left out of the search. The public knew nothing of the loss of \"Inkerman\" and \"Cerisoles\" until wartime censorship in Canada ended in 1918. No wreckage of \"Inkerman\" or \"Cerisoles\" was ever found, and their exact whereabouts and fate remain unknown.\n\n\n"}

She was given, along with her mother, Pati, and her father, Jack, to the old Orange Park, Florida site of the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center by Pierre Abreu on May 13, 1931 after the death of his mother, Madame Rosalia Abreu.\n\nGua was brought into the Kellogg home at the age of 7 1/2 months, and reared with their son Donald, who was 10 months old at the time. For nine months the Kelloggs raised the two as \"brother and sister\", and comprehensively recorded the development of the chimpanzee and the human child. When around one year old, Gua often tested ahead of Donald in such tasks as responding to simple commands or using a cup and spoon. Slight differences in their placement included people recognition. Gua recognized people from their clothes and their smell while Donald recognized them by their faces.\n\nThe parting difference came with language. Donald was about 16 months and Gua was a little over a year old when they had language testing. Gua could not speak, but Donald could form words.

{"id": "31631838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31631838", "title": "Hypergravity", "text": "Hypergravity\n\nHypergravity is defined as the condition where the force of gravity exceeds that on the surface of the Earth. This is expressed as being greater than 1 g. Hypergravity conditions are created on Earth for research on human physiology in aerial combat and space flight, as well as testing of materials and equipment for space missions. Manufacturing of titanium aluminide turbine blades in 20 g is being explored by researchers at the European Space Agency (ESA).\n\nAll of this is of extreme importance because human physiology and materials are used to build planes, spaceships and structures, which are all accustomed to Earth’s normal gravity.\nNASA scientists have recently been looking at meteorite impacts, and after testing certain strains of bacteria, they discovered that most strains were able to reproduce under pressures exceeding 7,500 g’s.\n\nRecent research carried out on extremophiles in Japan involved a variety of bacteria including \"Escherichia coli\" and \"Paracoccus denitrificans\" being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an ultracentrifuge at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 times \"g\" (the normal acceleration due to gravity on Earth). Another study that has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reports that some bacteria can exist even in extreme \"hypergravity\". In other words, they can still live and breed despite gravitational forces that are 400,000 times greater than what's felt here on Earth.\n\"Paracoccus denitrificans\" was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually found only in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of supernovas. Analysis showed that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for successful growth under hypergravity. The research has implications on the feasibility of existence of exobacteria and panspermia. A concern of this practice is rapid spinning. If someone moves their head too quickly while they're inside a fast-moving centrifuge, they might feel uncomfortably like they're tumbling head over heels. This can happen when balance-sensing fluids in the semicircular canals of the inner ear become \"confused\". Some experiments using centrifuges often include devices that fix the subjects' heads in place to prevent that illusion. Traveling through space, however, with one's head fixed in place is not practical.\n\nTo understand and describe the influence of gravity in systems, the observation of behaviour in microgravity and at 1g (where g is the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Earth) is not sufficient.\n\nResearchers calculated from a weight loss experiment that using 5 lb. ankle weights and 2.5 lb. wrist weights would have a 14% improved NEAT calorie burn while doing household chores. Track and basketball primarily plyometric) metrics improved by 8–25% mostly depending upon if the subjects used weighted vests all day or only when training, but the effect disappeared after a month of not using hypergravity training.\n\nHigh gravity conditions generated by centrifuge is applied in the chemical industry, casting, and material synthesis. The convection and mass transfer are greatly affected by the gravitational condition. Researchers reported that the high-gravity level can effectively affect the phase composition and morphology of the products.\n\nEver since Pearl proposed the rate of living theory of aging, numerous studies have demonstrated its validity in poikilotherms. In mammals, however, satisfactory experimental demonstration is still lacking because an externally imposed increase of basal metabolic rate of these animals (e.g. by placement in the cold) is usually accompanied by general homeostatic disturbance and stress. The present study was based on the finding that rats exposed to slightly increased gravity are able to adapt with little chronic stress but at a higher level of basal metabolic expenditure (increased 'rate of living'). The rate of aging of 17-month-old rats that had been exposed to 3.14 \"g\" in an animal centrifuge for 8 months was larger than of controls as shown by apparently elevated lipofuscin content in heart and kidney, reduced numbers and increased size of mitochondria of heart tissue, and inferior liver mitochondria respiration (reduced 'efficiency': 20% larger ADP: 0 ratio, P less than 0.01; reduced 'speed': 8% lower respiratory control ratio, P less than 0.05). Steady-state food intake per day per kg body weight, which is presumably proportional to 'rate of living' or specific basal metabolic expenditure, was about 18% higher than in controls (P less than 0.01) after an initial 2-month adaptation period. Finally, though half of the centrifuged animals lived only a little shorter than controls (average about 343 vs. 364 days on the centrifuge, difference statistically nonsignificant), the remaining half (longest survivors) lived on the centrifuge an average of 520 days (range 483–572) compared to an average of 574 days (range 502–615) for controls, computed from onset of centrifugation, or 11% shorter (P less than 0.01). Therefore, these results show that a moderate increase of the level of basal metabolism of young adult rats adapted to hypergravity compared to controls in normal gravity is accompanied by a roughly similar increase in the rate of organ aging and reduction of survival, in agreement with Pearl's rate of living theory of aging, previously experimentally demonstrated only in poikilotherms.\n\nPups from gestating rats exposed to hypergravity (1.8 G) or to normal gravity at the perinatal period were evaluated. By comparison to controls, the hypergravity group had shorter latencies before choosing a maze arm in a T-maze and fewer exploratory pokes in a hole board. During dyadic encounters, the hypergravity group had a lower number of self-grooming episodes and shorter latencies before crossing under the opposing rat.\n\n"}

He was known for his partnership with Dean Martin as the groundbreaking act of Martin and Lewis.\n\nLewis went on to star in, write, produce and direct many motion pictures, such as \"The Delicate Delinquent\", \"The Sad Sack\", \"Rock-A-Bye Baby\", \"The Geisha Boy\", \"Don't Give Up The Ship\", \"Visit to a Small Planet\", \"Cinderfella\", \"The Bellboy\", \"The Ladies' Man\", \"The Errand Boy\", \"It's Only Money\", \"The Nutty Professor\", \"Who's Minding the Store?\", \"The Patsy\", \"The Disorderly Orderly\" and \"The Family Jewels\". \n\nOutside of his career, he supported fundraising for muscular dystrophy research, during 60 years as national chairman and spokesman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association and 44 years hosting \"The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon\" every Labor Day weekend. In 1977, Lewis was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the organization.\n\nAs one of the most successful performers in show business, with worldwide box office receipts of his films in excess of $800 million, Lewis received global acclaim for his unique ability and style with both comedy and drama. As part of Martin and Lewis and as a solo actor, he was voted Hollywood's top box-office draw from 1951 to 1965, in later years as the sole comedian.\n\nLewis was born on March 16, 1926, at Newark Beth Israel Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, to Russian Jewish parents. His father, Daniel Levitch (1902–1980), born in New York, was a master of ceremonies and vaudeville entertainer who used the professional name Danny Lewis. His mother, Rachel \"Rae\" Levitch (née Brodsky; 1903–1983) went by the stage name Rae Lewis, was a piano player for the radio station WOR and was her husband's musical director. Lewis began performing at age five and would often perform alongside his parents in the Catskill Mountains in New York.\n\nHe was a \"character\" even in his teenage years, pulling pranks in his neighborhood including sneaking into kitchens to steal fried chicken and pies. He dropped out of Irvington High School in the tenth grade. By age 15, he had developed his \"Record Act\" miming lyrics to songs while a phonograph played offstage. He used the professional name Joey Lewis but soon changed it to Jerry Lewis to avoid confusion with comedian Joe E. Lewis and heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis. He landed a gig at a burlesque house in Buffalo, but his performance fell flat and was unable to book any more shows. Lewis worked as a soda jerk and a theater usher for Suzanne Pleshette's father Gene at the Paramount Theater to make ends meet.\n\nA veteran burlesque comedian, Max Coleman, who had worked with Lewis' father years before, persuaded him to try again. Irving Kaye, a Borscht Belt comedian, saw Lewis' mime act at Brown's Hotel in Loch Sheldrake, New York, the following summer, and the audience was so enthusiastic that Kaye became Lewis' manager and guardian for Borscht Belt appearances. During World War II, he was rejected for military service because of a heart murmur.\n\nLewis initially gained attention as part of a double act with singer Dean Martin, who served as straight man to Lewis' zany antics as the Martin and Lewis comedy team. They were different from other duo acts of the time because they played to each other and had ad-libbed improvisational segments within their planned routines.\n\nAfter forming in 1946, they quickly rose to national prominence, first with their popular nightclub act, then as stars of \"The Martin and Lewis Show\" on the radio NBC Red Network. The two made appearances on early live television on their June 20, 1948 debut broadcast on \"Toast of the Town\" (later renamed as \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" on September 25, 1955) on CBS.\nThis was followed on October 3, 1948, by an appearance on NBC's \"Welcome Aboard\".\n\nIn 1950, Martin and Lewis signed with NBC to be one of a series of weekly rotating hosts of \"The Colgate Comedy Hour\", a live Sunday evening broadcast. Lewis, writer for the team's nightclub act, hired Norman Lear and Ed Simmons as regular writers for their \"Comedy Hour\" material. Their \"Comedy Hour\" shows consisted of stand-up dialogue, song and dance from their nightclub act and movies, backed by Dick Stabile's big band, slapstick and satirical sketch comedy, Martin's solo songs, and Lewis' solo pantomimes or physical numbers.\n\nMartin and Lewis often broke character, ad-libbing and breaking the fourth wall. While not completely capturing the orchestrated mayhem of their nightclub act, the \"Comedy Hour\" displayed the charismatic energy between the team and established their popularity nationwide. By 1951, with an appearance at New York's Paramount Theater, they were a cultural phenomenon, attracting crowds rivaled only by Frank Sinatra earlier (a friend of Lewis and Martin) and later by other stars Elvis Presley and The Beatles.\n\nThe duo began their Paramount film careers as ensemble players in \"My Friend Irma\" (1949), based on the radio series of the same name, and its sequel \"My Friend Irma Goes West\" (1950). Starting with \"At War with the Army\" (1950), Martin and Lewis were the stars of their own vehicles in fourteen additional titles, \"That's My Boy\" (1951), \"Sailor Beware\" (1952), \"Jumping Jacks\" (1952), \"The Stooge\" (1952), \"Scared Stiff\" (1953), \"The Caddy\" (1953), \"Money from Home\" (1953), \"Living It Up\" (1954), \"3 Ring Circus\" (1954), \"You're Never Too Young\" (1955), \"Artists and Models\" (1955) and \"Pardners\" (1956) ending with \"Hollywood or Bust\" (1956). All 16 films were produced by Hal B. Wallis.\n\nThey also starred as cameos in Bing Crosby and Bob Hope's film \"Road to Bali\" (1952). Attesting to the duo's popularity, DC Comics published \"The Adventures of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis\" from 1952 to 1957. In 1954, the team appeared on episode 191 of \"What's My Line?\" as mystery guests, appeared on the 27th annual Academy Awards in 1955 and then appeared on \"The Steve Allen Show\" and \"The Today Show\" in 1956.\n\nThe Martin and Lewis films were reliable financial successes for Paramount, and hugely popular with audiences. In later years, both Lewis and Martin admitted frustration, and were critical of Wallis for his formulaic and trite film choices, restricting them to narrow, repetitive roles. As Martin's roles in their films became less important over time, Lewis receiving the majority of critical acclaim, the partnership came under strain.\n\nMartin's participation became an embarrassment in 1954 when \"Look\" magazine published a publicity photo of the team for the magazine cover but cropped Martin out. The partnership ended with their final nightclub act on July 24, 1956 (the team's 10th anniversary of their debut as a duo). Both Martin and Lewis went on to highly successful solo careers, and neither would comment on the split nor consider a reunion. However, they would occasionally be seen at the same public events.\n\nAfter his partnership with Martin ended in 1956, Lewis and his wife Patty took a vacation in Las Vegas to consider the direction of his career. He felt his life was in a crisis state: \"I was unable to put one foot in front of the other with any confidence. I was completely unnerved to be alone\". While there, he received an urgent request from his friend Sid Luft, who was Judy Garland's husband and manager, saying that she couldn't perform that night in Las Vegas because of strep throat, and asking Lewis to fill in.\n\nLewis had not sung alone on stage since he was five years old, twenty-five years before, but he appeared before the audience of a thousand nonetheless, delivering jokes and clowning with the audience while Garland sat off-stage, watching. He then sang a rendition of a song he'd learned as a child, \"Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody\" along with \"Come Rain or Come Shine.\" Lewis recalled, \"When I was done, the place exploded. I walked off the stage knowing I could make it on my own\".\n\nAt his wife's pleading, Lewis used his own money to record the songs on a single. Record company Decca Records heard it, liked it and insisted he record an album for them. The single of \"Rock-a-Bye Your Baby\" went to #10 and the album \"Jerry Lewis Just Sings\" went to #3 on the \"Billboard\" charts, staying near the top for four months and selling a million and a half copies.\n\nWith the success of that album he recorded the additional albums \"More Jerry Lewis\" (an EP of songs from this release was released as \"Somebody Loves Me\"), and \"Jerry Lewis Sings Big Songs For Little People\" (later reissued with fewer tracks as \"Jerry Lewis Sings For Children\"). Non-album singles were released, and \"It All Depends On You\", hit the charts in April and May 1957, but peaked at only #68. Further singles were recorded and released by Lewis into the mid-1960s.\n\nBut these were not Lewis's first foray into recording, nor his first appearance on the hit charts. During his partnership with Martin, they made several recordings together, charting at #22 in 1948 with the 1920s chestnut \"That Certain Party\" and later mostly re-recording songs highlighted in their films. Also during the time of their partnership, but without Martin, he recorded numerous novelty-comedy numbers for adults as well as records specifically intended for the children's market.\n\nHaving proven he could sing and do live shows, he began performing regularly at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, beginning in late 1956, which marked a turning point in his life and career. The Sands signed him for five years, to perform six weeks each year and paid him the same amount they had paid Martin and Lewis as a team. The critics gave him positive reviews: \"Jerry was wonderful. He has proved that he can be a success by himself,\" wrote one. He continued with club performances in Miami, New York, Chicago and Washington.\n\nSuch live performances became a staple of his career and over the years he performed at casinos, theaters and state fairs coast-to-coast. In February 1957, he followed Garland at the Palace Theater in New York and Martin called on the phone during this period to wish him the best of luck. \"I've never been happier,\" said Lewis. \"I have peace of mind for the first time.\" Lewis established himself as a solo act on TV starting with the first of six appearances on \"What's My Line?\" from 1956 to 1966.\n\nHe guest appeared on both \"Tonight Starring Jack Paar\" and \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and beginning in January 1957, in a number of solo TV specials for NBC. He starred in his adaptation of \"The Jazz Singer\" for \"Startime\". Lewis hosted the Academy Awards three times, in 1956, 1957 and the 31st Academy Awards in 1959, which ran twenty minutes short, forcing Lewis to improvise to fill time. DC Comics, switching from Martin and Lewis, published a new comic book series titled \"The Adventures of Jerry Lewis\", running from 1957 to 1971.\n\nLewis remained at Paramount and became a comedy star in his own right. His first solo movie was \"The Delicate Delinquent\" (1957), marking Lewis' debut as film producer and screenwriter. It originally had been planned as the next Martin and Lewis film. Lewis and Martin had made two films with director Frank Tashlin, whose background as a \"Looney Tunes\" cartoon director suited Lewis' brand of humor. On his own, after starring in \"The Sad Sack\" (1957), Lewis then made more films with Tashlin starting with \"Rock-A-Bye Baby\" (1958) and \"The Geisha Boy\" (1958).\n\nOn two occasions, after the split, Lewis was invited by Martin on stage in 1958 and 1961. But the split was seriously realized. He also appeared in \"Don't Give Up The Ship\" (1959), and played Itchy McRabbitt, an uncredited character role in \"Li'l Abner\" (1959). By the end of his contract with producer Hal B. Wallis, Lewis had several productions of his own under his belt and was eager to flex his creative muscle. As a solo, Lewis was free to deepen his comedy with pathos, believing, \"Funny without pathos is a pie in the face. And a pie in the face is funny, but I wanted more.\"\n\nIn 1959, a contract between Paramount and Jerry Lewis Productions (Lewis' production company) was signed specifying a payment of $10 million plus 60% of the profits for 14 films over a seven-year period. This contract made Lewis the highest paid individual Hollywood talent to date and was unprecedented in that he had unlimited creative control, including final cut, and the return of film rights after 30 years.\n\nLewis' clout and box office were so strong that Barney Balaban, the head of production at Paramount at that time, told the press, \"If Jerry wants to burn down the studio I'll give him the match!\"\n\n He had finished his film contract with Wallis with \"Visit to a Small Planet\" (1960) and wrapped up production on his own film \"Cinderfella\" (1960), with Ed Wynn and directed by Tashlin. The movie was postponed for a Christmas 1960 release. Paramount Pictures, needing a quickie motion picture for its summer 1960 schedule, held Lewis to his contract to produce one. As a result, he made his debut as film director of and starred in \"The Bellboy\" (1960). \n\nUsing the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami as his setting — on a small budget, with a very tight shooting schedule — Lewis shot the film during the day and performed at the hotel in the evenings. Bill Richmond collaborated with him on many of the sight gags. Lewis later revealed that Paramount was not happy about financing a \"silent movie\" and withdrew backing. Lewis used his own funds to cover the movie's $950,000 budget.\n\nLewis’ idol, Stan Laurel (of Laurel and Hardy), acted anonymously as consultant, convincing Lewis to make important edits. Interestingly enough, Ted Richmond did a Stan “cameo “, an imitation. Lewis and Richmond made a filmed appeal to Laurel for permission to use his likeness. Lewis offered Laurel a lucrative contract to do what he did for “\"The Bellboy\"”, on subsequent Lewis films.\n\nLaurel took the offer seriously but after watching one of Lewis’ solo films and not understanding his on screen character, declined. Lewis followed “\"The Bellboy\"” by directing several more movies he co-wrote with Richmond, including \"The Ladies Man\" (1961), where Lewis constructed a three-story dollhouse-like set spanning two sound stages. The set was equipped with state of the art lighting and sound, eliminating the need for boom mics in each room.\n\nHis next feature \"The Errand Boy\" (1961), was one of the earliest films about moviemaking, utilizing all of Paramount's backlot and offices. Lewis then starred in his first special in three years \"The Wacky World of Jerry Lewis\". He appeared in an episode of \"Celebrity Golf\" followed by a guest spot on an episode of \"The Garry Moore Show\". He then starred in Tashlin's \"It's Only Money\" (1962).\n\nLewis took on as guest host on \"The Tonight Show\" during the transition from Jack Paar to Johnny Carson in 1962. His appearance on the show scored the highest ratings thus far in late night, surpassing other guest hosts and Paar. The three major networks began a bidding war, wooing Lewis for his own talk show, which debuted the following year. Lewis then directed, co-wrote and starred in the smash hit \"The Nutty Professor\" (1963), with Stella Stevens as co-star.\n\nA parody of \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\", it featured him as a socially awkward professor inventing a serum that turns him into a handsome but obnoxious ladies man. It is largely considered to be Lewis' finest and most memorable film and in 2004, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Lewis then appeared in a cameo role in Stanley Kramer's comedy epic \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963).\n\nHe starred next in Tashlin's \"Who's Minding the Store?\" (1963) and then hosted \"The Jerry Lewis Show\", a 13-week lavish, big-budget show for ABC, that aired from September to December in 1963. The show suffered in the ratings, beleaguered by technical and other difficulties, including the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which left the country in a somber mood. Lewis co-wrote and starred in \"The Patsy\" (1964), his satire about the Hollywood star-making industry.\n\nHis last film collaboration with Tashlin was \"The Disorderly Orderly\" (1964), in which Lewis served as executive producer of. After that, Lewis then directed, co-wrote and appeared in \"The Family Jewels\" (1965) about a young heiress who must choose among six uncles, one of whom is up to no good and out to harm the girl's beloved bodyguard who practically raised her. Lewis played all six uncles and the bodyguard. This Diamond Ring, a song sung by Lewis' son Gary Lewis and his band was featured in the film.\n\nIn 1965, Lewis was interviewed on \"The David Susskind Show\". Lewis' last film for Paramount \"Boeing Boeing\" (1965), co-starred him with Tony Curtis's lead and is based on the French stage play. He received a Golden Globe nomination for this role. Lewis directed and appeared on an episode of \"Ben Casey\", an early dramatic role. He also appeared on \"The Andy Williams Show\", and \"Hullabaloo\" with his son Gary Lewis. In 1966, Paramount changed ownership and the new executives declined to renew Lewis' 1959 profit sharing contract.\n\nLewis moved to other studios, starting with Columbia Pictures, where he made and starred in \"Three on a Couch\" (1966). He appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" alongside Richard Pryor. For 20th Century Fox, Lewis starred in \"Way...Way Out\" (1966) with Connie Stevens, then he had cameos in \"Batman\", \"Laugh In\", was a panalist on \"Password\" and in a pilot for \"Sheriff Who\". Lewis returned with a new version of \"The Jerry Lewis Show\", this time as a one-hour variety show for NBC, which ran from 1967 to 1969. He would next direct and star in \"The Big Mouth\" (1967).\n\nLewis made an appearance on \"The Danny Thomas Hour\", starred in Jerry Paris' film \"Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River\" (1968) and then appear as a guest on \"Playboy After Dark\", surprising Davis Jr. in 1968. Lewis went on to star in \"Hook, Line & Sinker\" (1969) with co-star Peter Lawford and afterwards, guest starred in an episode of \"Jimmy Durante Presents the Lennon Sisters Hour\".\n\nIn 1970, Lewis guest appeared on \"The Red Skelton Show\", then contributed to some scripts for the Filmation animated series \"Will the Real Jerry Lewis Please Sit Down\". He later guest hosted \"The Mike Douglas Show\" and then directed an episode of \"The Bold Ones\". He made guest appearances on \"The Hollywood Palace\", \"The Engelbert Humperdinck Show\", \"The Irv Kupcinet Show\", \"The Linkletter Show\", \"The Real Tom Kennedy Show\" and \"A Christmas Night with the Stars\".\n\nFor United Artists, Lewis directed and made his first offscreen voice performance as a bandleader in \"One More Time\" (1970), a sequel to the 1968 film \"Salt and Pepper\". Next, he produced, directed and starred in \"Which Way to the Front?\" (1970) for Warner Bros. and then guest appeared on \"The Carol Burnett Show\", \"The Rolf Harris Show\" and \"The Kraft Music Hall\" in 1971.\n\nLewis then directed and starred in the partly unreleased \"The Day the Clown Cried\" (1972), a drama set in a Nazi concentration camp. Lewis rarely discussed the film, but stated litigation over post-production finances and copyright prevented the film's completion and theatrical release. During his book tour for \"Dean and Me\" he also said a factor for the film's burial was that he was not proud of the effort.\n\nLewis explained his reason for choosing the project and the emotional difficulty of the subject matter in an interview with an Australian documentary film crew in 2012. A 31-minute version was shown on the German television station ARD, in the documentary Der Clown in 2016. It was later put on DVD and shown at Deutsches Filminstitute\n\nWithin historical context, the movie was the earliest attempt by an American motion picture director to address the subject of The Holocaust, preceding by thirteen years Claude Lanzmann's groundbreaking film \"Shoah\", and more than twenty years, Steven Spielberg's \"Schindler's List\" and \"Life is Beautiful\", dealing with similar themes. Significant speculation continues to surround the film. Following this, Lewis would take a break from the movie business for several years.\n\nIn 1973, Lewis was a guest on \"The Dick Cavett Show\" and \"NBC Follies\". He then appeared on \"Celebrity Sportsman\" in 1974. Next, Lewis appeared as guest on both \"Cher\" and \"Dinah!\" in 1975. Lewis then guested on an episode of \"Tony Orlando and Dawn\". In September 1976, Sinatra shocked Lewis by bringing Dean Martin on stage during the \"MDA Jerry Lewis Telethon\".\n\nAs Martin and Lewis embraced, the audience cheered and the phones lit up, resulting in one of the telethon's most profitable years. Lewis reported the event was one of the three most memorable of his life. Lewis quipped, \"So, you working?\", which he stated was a call-back to a remark he'd made to Martin when they first met. Martin, playing drunk, replied that he was \"at the Meggum\" (meaning the MGM Grand). The reunion made international headlines and is considered one of the most iconic moments in TV history.\n\nLess well known, Lewis returned the surprise the following year by walking onto the Aladdin stage in Las Vegas during Martin and Sinatra's performance. They exchanged jokes for several minutes. Lewis then starred in a revival of \"Hellzapoppin\" with co-star Lynn Redgrave, but it closed on the road before reaching Broadway. In 1979, he served as guest host and ringmaster of \"Circus of the Stars\".\n\n After an absence of 11 years, Lewis returned to the big screen in \"Hardly Working\" (1981), which he directed and starred in. Despite being panned by critics, it eventually earned $50 million. In 1982, Lewis was a guest on \"Late Night with David Letterman\". In 1983, Lewis co-starred in Martin Scorsese's film \"The King of Comedy\", as a late-night TV host, plagued by two obsessive fans, played by Robert De Niro and Sandra Bernhard. He received wide critical acclaim and a BAFTA nomination for this serious dramatic role.\n\nLewis guest hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" and also starred in \"Cracking Up\" a.k.a. \"Smorgasbord\" (1983) and \"Slapstick (Of Another Kind)\" (1984). Next, Lewis starred in two French films, \"To Catch a Cop\" a.k.a. \"The Defective Detective\" (1984) and \"How Did You Get In? We Didn't See You Leave\" (1984). Lewis stated that as long as distribution of the two movies are under his control, they would never be released in America.\n\nHe then hosted a syndicated talk show for Metromedia, which was not continued beyond the scheduled five shows. In 1985, Lewis directed an episode of the Showtime series \"Brothers\". In 1986, Lewis appeared at the first Comic Relief, where he was the only performer to receive a standing ovation and after that, he was interviewed on \"Classic Treasures\". Lewis also starred in the ABC televised movie \"Fight For Life\" (1987) with Patty Duke.\n\nIn 1987, Lewis and Davis Jr. performed in Las Vegas together (his first 'double-act' since the split with Martin in 1956). That same year, he also learned of the death of Martin's son Dean Paul Martin and attended the funeral, which lead to a more substantial reconciliation with Martin. In 1988, Lewis hosted \"America's All-Time Favorite Movies\", then was interviewed by Howard Cosell on \"Speaking of Everything.\" He then starred in five episodes of the CBS program \"Wiseguy\".\n\nThe filming schedule of the show forced Lewis to miss the Museum of the Moving Image's opening with a retrospective of his work. In 1989, Lewis joined Martin on stage, for what would be Martin's final live performance, at Bally's Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Lewis wheeled out a cake on Martin's 72nd birthday, sang \"Happy Birthday\" to him and joked, \"Why we broke up, I'll never know\". Again, their appearance together made headlines. He then appeared in \"Cookie\" (1989).\n\nIn 1991, Lewis guest starred in and directed an episode of the FOX series \"Good Grief\". In 1992, Lewis had a cameo in \"Mr. Saturday Night\" (1992), appeared as a guest on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\", \"The Whoopi Goldberg Show\" and was interviewed by Alan King on \"Inside The Comedy Mind\". Lewis produced a three-part retrospective for The Disney Channel entitled \"Martin & Lewis: Their Golden Age of Comedy\", using previously unseen kinescopes from his personal archive, highlighting his years as part of a team with Martin and his solo work.\n\nIn 1993, he was the first of a series of 'classic' comedians to guest star in \"Mad About You\", playing an eccentric billionaire. He appearanced on \"Larry King Live\" and co-starred in the film \"Arizona Dream\" (1993) as a car salesman uncle to Johnny Depp's character as his nephew. Lewis then starred as the 'Comedy Legend' father of a young comic, played by Oliver Platt, in \"Funny Bones\" (1995).\n\nLewis' role serves as the metaphorical pivot in 20th Century comedy, from slapstick anarchists to clever storytellers. Both \"Arizona Dream\" and \"Funny Bones\" were tongue-in-cheek roles for independent films. In 1995, realizing a lifelong ambition, Lewis made his Broadway debut, as a replacement cast member, in a revival of \"Damn Yankees\". Playing the devil, he was reportedly paid the highest sum in Broadway history at the time. He performed in both the national and London runs of the musical.\n\nLewis missed three performances of the live show in four-plus years, one being Martin's funeral. He was then interviewed by James Lipton on \"Inside the Actors Studio\". In 1996, Lewis served as executive producer of the Universal Pictures release of \"The Nutty Professor\" remake, starring Eddie Murphy as the lead role of Professor Sherman Klump. Lewis would also appear on the 12th American Comedy Awards in 1998.\n\nIn 2000, Lewis appeared as a guest on \"The Martin Short Show\", then \"Russell Gilbert Live\" and also executive produced \"\". In 2003, Lewis did guest appearances on \"The View\", \"Your World with Neil Cavuto\" and did a guest voice as Professor Frink's father in a \"Treehouse of Horror\" episode of \"The Simpsons\". He then made a cameo in \"Miss Cast Away and the Island Girls\" in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, Lewis went on make guest appearances on \"Late Night with Conan O' Brien\" and \"Live with Kelly\". In 2006, He guest starred in an episode of \"\" as Munch's uncle. Lewis sang and recorded the duet song \"Time After Time\" with Dean Martin's daughter, Deana Martin, for her album \"Memories Are Made of This\". He then appeared on the 81st Academy Awards in 2009.\n\n In 2012, Lewis directed a musical theatre play of \"The Nutty Professor\" at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in Nashville. In Brazil, he appeared in \"Till Luck Do Us Part 2\" (2013), a sequel to the 2012 film \"Till Luck Do Us Part\". In 2014, Lewis was guest on \"The Talk\" and then on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\". In 2015, he was interviewed by Raymond Arroyo on \"World Over\".\n\nLewis starred in a small role in \"The Trust\" (2016) and a serious lead role in his final film \"Max Rose\" (2016), which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. He was a guest on \"WTF with Marc Maron\" and in December, expressed interest in another movie. Lewis' last appearance was in an episode of \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\".\n\nDuring production of \"The Bellboy\", Lewis pioneered the technique of using video cameras and multiple closed circuit monitors, which allowed him to review his performance instantly. This was necessary since he was acting as well as directing. His techniques and methods of video assist, documented in his book and his USC class, enabled him to complete most of his films on time and under budget since reshoots could take place immediately instead of waiting for the dailies.\n\n\"Man in Motion\", a featurette for \"Three on a Couch\", features the video system, named \"Jerry's Noisy Toy\" and shows Lewis receiving the Golden Light Technical Achievement award for its development. Lewis stated he worked with the head of Sony to produce the prototype. While he initiated its practice and use, and was instrumental in its development, he did not hold a patent. This practice is now commonplace in filmmaking.\n\nStarting in 1967, Lewis taught a film directing class at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles for a number of years. His students included George Lucas, whose friend Steven Spielberg sometimes sat in on classes. Lewis screened Spielberg's early film \"Amblin'\" and told his students, \"That's what filmmaking is all about.\" The class covered all topics related to filmmaking, including pre and post production, marketing and distribution, and filming comedy with rhythm and timing. His book \"The Total Film Maker\" (1971), was based on 480 hours of his class lectures.\n\nWhile Lewis was popular in France for his duo films with Dean Martin and his solo comedy films, his reputation and stature increased after the Paramount contract, when he began to exert total control over all aspects of his films. His involvement in directing, writing, editing and art direction coincided with the rise of auteur theory in French intellectual film criticism and the French New Wave movement. He earned consistent praise from French critics in the influential magazines \"Cahiers du Cinéma\" and \"Positif\", where he was hailed as an ingenious auteur.\n\nHis singular \"mise-en-scene\", and skill behind the camera, were aligned with Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock and Satyajit Ray. Appreciated too, was the complexity of his also being in front of the camera. The new French criticism viewed cinema as an art form unto itself, and comedy as part of this art. Lewis is then fitted into a historical context and seen as not only worthy of critique, but as an innovator and satirist of his time. Jean-Pierre Coursodon states in a 1975 Film Comment article, \"The merit of the French critics, auteurist excesses notwithstanding, was their willingness to look at what Lewis was doing as a filmmaker for what it was, rather than with some preconception of what film comedy should be.\"\n\nNot yet curricula at universities or art schools, Cinema Studies and Film theory were avant-garde in early 1960s America. Mainstream movie reviewers such as Pauline Kael, were dismissive of auteur theory, and others, seeing only absurdist comedy, criticized Lewis for his ambition and \"castigated him for his self-indulgence\" and egotism. \"The total film-maker, so admired in France, made Hollywood uncomfortable, since the system has always operated otherwise.\"\n\nAppreciation of Lewis became a misunderstood stereotype about \"the French\", and it was often the object of jokes in American pop culture. \"That Americans can't see Jerry Lewis' genius is bewildering,\" says N. T. Binh, a French film magazine critic. Such bewilderment was the basis of the book \"Why the French Love Jerry Lewis\". In a lingering perception that French audiences adored him, Lewis stated in interviews he was more popular in Germany, Japan and Australia.\n\nThroughout his adult life and career, Lewis was a world-renowned humanitarian, philanthropist and \"number one volunteer\" who supported fundraising for research into muscular dystrophy. From 1956 to 2011, he served as national chairman of and spokesman for the Muscular Dystrophy Association (formerly, the Muscular Dystrophy Associations of America). As early as December 1951, Lewis, along with Martin, made appeals for MDA at the conclusion of \"The Colgate Comedy Hour\".\n\nIn 1954, Lewis and Rocky Marciano fought in a special boxing bout for MDA's fund drive, with Martin as referee. He then began hosting New York area telethons to benefit the organization from 1952 to 1959, leading up to the live annual Labor Day event of \"The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon\" (also referred to as \"Jerry Lewis Extra Special Special\", \"Jerry Lewis Super Show\" and \"Jerry Lewis Stars Across America\"), which ran from 1966 to 2010. In 1977, Lewis was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on behalf of the Muscular Dystrophy Association.\n\nBy 1990, popular culture had shifted its view of the differently-abled and the telethon format. Lewis and the telethon's methods were criticized by disabled-rights activists who believed the show was \"designed to evoke pity rather than empower the disabled.\" The activists said the telethon perpetuated prejudices and stereotypes, that Lewis treated those he claimed to be helping with little respect, and that he used offensive language when describing them. Lewis rebutted the criticism and defended his methods saying, \"If you don't tug at their heartstrings, then you're on the air for nothing.\"\nIn 1998, Lewis' telethon became the first ever to be viewed around the globe via internet simulcast by RealNetworks on MDA's website. In 2009, Lewis was presented the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for his efforts for MDA. On August 3, 2011, it was announced that Lewis would no longer host the MDA telethons and that he was no longer associated with the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Then on May 1, 2015, it was announced that in view of \"the new realities of television viewing and philanthropic giving\", the telethon was being discontinued.\n\nIn early 2016, Lewis broke a five-year silence by making a surprise online video statement at MDA's brand re-launch event at Carnegie Hall in New York City for the organization on its website in honor of its rebranding marking his first (and as it turned out, his final) appearance in support of MDA since his last telethon in 2010 and the end of his tenure as national chairman and spokesman in 2011.\n\nFor over half a century, Lewis raised an estimated $2.6 billion in donations for the cause. MDA's website states, \"Jerry's love, passion and brilliance are woven throughout this organization, which he helped build from the ground up. Lewis courted sponsors for MDA, appeared at openings of MDA care and research centers, addressed meetings of civic organizations, volunteers and the MDA Board of Directors, successfully lobbied Congress for federal neuromuscular disease research funds and made countless phone calls and visits to families served by MDA.\n\nDuring Lewis' lifetime, MDA-funded scientists discovered the causes of most of the diseases in the Muscular Dystrophy Association's program, developing treatments, therapies and standards of care that have allowed many people living with these diseases to live longer and grow stronger.\" Over 200 research and treatment facilities were built with donations raised by the Jerry Lewis Telethons.\n\nIn 1969, Lewis agreed to lend his name to \"Jerry Lewis Cinemas\", offered by National Cinema Corporation as a franchise business opportunity for those interested in theatrical movie exhibition. Jerry Lewis Cinemas stated that their theaters could be operated by a staff of as few as two with the aid of automation and support provided by the franchiser in booking film and other aspects of film exhibition. A forerunner of the smaller rooms typical of later multi-screen complexes, a Jerry Lewis Cinema was billed in franchising ads as a \"mini-theatre\" with a seating capacity of between 200 and 350.\n\nIn addition to Lewis's name, each Jerry Lewis Cinemas bore a sign with a cartoon logo of Lewis in profile. Initially 158 territories were franchised, with a buy-in fee of $10,000 or $15,000 depending on the territory, for what was called an \"individual exhibitor\". For $50,000, Jerry Lewis Cinemas offered an opportunity known as an \"area directorship\", in which investors controlled franchising opportunities in a territory as well as their own cinemas. The success of the chain was hampered by a policy of only booking second-run, family-friendly films.\n\nEventually the policy was changed, and the Jerry Lewis Cinemas were allowed to show more competitive movies. But after a decade the chain failed and both Lewis and National Cinema Corporation declared bankruptcy in 1980.\n\nIn 1990, Lewis wrote and directed a short film for UNICEF's \"How Are The Children?\" anthology exploring the rights of children worldwide. The eight-minute segment, titled \"Boy\", was about a young white child in a black world and being subjected to quiet, insidious racism, and outright racist bullying. In 2010, Lewis met with seven-year-old Lochie Graham, who shared his idea for \"Jerry's House\", a place for vulnerable and traumatized children. Lewis and Graham entered into a joint partnership for an Australian and a U.S.-based charity and began raising funds to build the facility in Melbourne, Australia. On September 12, 2016, Lewis lent his name and star power to Criss Angel's HELP (Heal Every Life Possible) charity event.\n\nLewis kept a low political profile for many years, having taken advice reportedly given to him by President John F. Kennedy, who told him \"Don't get into anything political. Don't do that because they will usurp your energy\". Nevertheless, he campaigned and performed on behalf of both JFK and Robert F. Kennedy. Lewis was a supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. For his 1957 NBC special, Lewis held his ground when southern affiliates objected to his stated friendship with Sammy Davis Jr. In a 1971 \"Movie Mirror\" magazine article, Lewis came out against the Vietnam War, when his son, Gary, returned from service traumatized. He vowed to leave the country rather than send another of his sons. \nLewis once stated political speeches should not be at the Oscars. \"I think we are the most dedicated industry in the world. And I think that we have to present ourselves that night as hard-working, caring and important people to the industry. We need to get more self-respect as an industry\".\nIn a 2004 interview with The Guardian, Lewis was asked what he was least proud of, to which he answered, \"Politics\". Not his politics, but the world's politics – the madness, the destruction, the general lack of respect. He lamented citizens' lack of pride in their country, stating, \"President Bush is my president. I will not say anything negative about the president of the United States. I don't do that. And I don't allow my children to do that. Likewise when I come to England don't you do any jokes about 'Mum' to me. That is the Queen of England, you moron.\" \"Do you know how tough a job it is to be the Queen of England?\"\n\nIn a December 2015 interview on EWTN's \"World Over\" with Raymond Arroyo, Lewis expressed opposition to the United States letting in Syrian refugees, saying \"No one has worked harder for the human condition than I have, but they're not part of the human condition if 11 guys in that group of 10,000 are ISIS. How can I take that chance?\" In the same interview, he criticized President Barack Obama for not being prepared for ISIS, while expressing support for Donald Trump, saying he would make a good president because he was a good \"showman\". He also added that he admired Ronald Reagan's presidency.\n\nIn 1998, at the Aspen U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, when asked which women comics he admired, Lewis answered, \"I don't like any female comedians.\" \"A woman doing comedy doesn't offend me but sets me back a bit.\" He later clarified his statements saying, \"Seeing a woman project the kind of aggression that you have to project as a comic just rubs me wrong.\" \"I cannot sit and watch a lady diminish her qualities to the lowest common denominator.\" Lewis mentioned his attitude as that of an older generation and said women are funny but not in 'broad' and 'crude' humor.\n\nHe went on to praise Lucille Ball as \"brilliant\" and said Carol Burnett is \"the greatest female entrepreneur of comedy.\" On other occasions Lewis expressed admiration for female comedians Totie Fields, Phyllis Diller, Kathleen Freeman, Elayne Boosler, Whoopi Goldberg and Tina Fey. During the 2007 MDA Telethon, Lewis used the word \"fag\" in a joke, for which he apologized. Lewis used the same word the following year on Australian television.\n\nIn 1995, a man named Gary Benson was revealed to have been stalking Lewis and his family. Benson subsequently served four years in prison.\n\nLewis was married twice:\n\n\nLewis had a number of illnesses and addictions related both to aging and a back injury sustained in a comedic pratfall. The fall has been stated as being either from a piano while performing at the Sands Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip on March 20, 1965, or during an appearance on \"The Andy Williams Show\". In its aftermath, Lewis became addicted to the painkiller Percodan for thirteen years. He said he had been off the drug since 1978. In April 2002, Lewis had a Medtronic \"Synergy\" neurostimulator implanted in his back, which helped reduce the discomfort. He was one of the company's leading spokesmen. In the 2011 documentary \"Method to the Madness of Jerry Lewis,\" Lewis said he had his first heart attack at age 34 while filming \"Cinderfella\" in 1960. In December 1982, he had another heart attack. En route to San Diego from New York City on a cross-country commercial airline flight on June 11, 2006, he had another.\n\nIt was discovered that he had pneumonia, as well as a severely damaged heart. He underwent a cardiac catheterization and two stents were inserted into one of his coronary arteries, which was 90 percent blocked. The surgery resulted in increased blood flow to his heart and allowed him to continue his rebound from earlier lung problems. Having the cardiac catheterization meant canceling several major events from his schedule, but Lewis fully recuperated in a matter of weeks. In 1999, Lewis' Australian tour was cut short when he had to be hospitalized in Darwin with viral meningitis. He was ill for more than five months. It was reported in the Australian press that he had failed to pay his medical bills. However, Lewis maintained that the payment confusion was the fault of his health insurer.\n\nThe resulting negative publicity caused him to sue his insurer for US$100 million. Lewis had prostate cancer, type 1 diabetes, pulmonary fibrosis, and a decades-long history of cardiovascular disease. Prednisone treatment in the late 1990s for pulmonary fibrosis resulted in weight gain and a noticeable change in his appearance. In September 2001, Lewis was unable to perform at a planned London charity event at the London Palladium. He was the headlining act, and he was introduced but did not appear. He had suddenly become unwell, apparently with heart problems.\n\nHe was subsequently taken to the hospital. Some months thereafter, Lewis began an arduous, months-long therapy that weaned him off prednisone and enabled him to return to work. On June 12, 2012, he was treated and released from a hospital after collapsing from hypoglycemia at a New York Friars Club event. This latest health issue forced him to cancel a show in Sydney. In an October 2016 interview with \"Inside Edition\", Lewis acknowledged that he might not star in any more films, given his advanced age, while admitting, through tears, that he was afraid of dying, as it would leave his wife and daughter alone. In June 2017, Lewis was hospitalized at a Las Vegas hospital for a urinary tract infection.\n\nLewis died at his home in Las Vegas, Nevada, at 9:15 a.m. (PDT) on August 20, 2017, at the age of 91. The cause was end-stage cardiac disease and peripheral artery disease. In his will, Lewis left his estate to his second wife of 34 years, SanDee Pitnick, and their daughter, and intentionally excluded his children from his first marriage as well as their descendants.\n\nFor almost two decades, from the late '40s to the mid-'60s, \"Lewis was a virtually unprecedented force in American popular culture.\" Widely acknowledged as a comic genius, Lewis influenced successive generations of comedians, comedy writers, performers and filmmakers. As Lewis was often referenced as the bridge from Vaudeville to modern comedy, Carl Reiner wrote after Lewis' death, \"All comedians watch other comedians, and every generation of comedians going back to those who watched Jerry on the \"Colgate Comedy Hour\" were influenced by Jerry. They say that mankind goes back to the first guy ... which everyone tries to copy. In comedy that guy was Jerry Lewis.\"\n\nLewis \"single-handedly created a style of humor that was half anarchy, half excruciation. Even comics who never took a pratfall in their careers owe something to the self-deprecation Jerry introduced into American show business.\" His self-deprecating humor can be found in Larry David or David Letterman.\n\nLewis' comedy style was physically uninhibited, expressive, and potentially volatile. He was known especially for his distinctive voice, facial expressions, pratfalls, and physical stunts. His improvisations and ad-libbing, especially in nightclubs and early television, were revolutionary among performers. It was \"marked by a raw, edgy energy that would distinguish him within the comedy landscape.\" Will Sloan, of \"Flavorwire\" wrote, \"In the late '40s and early '50s, nobody had ever seen a comedian as wild as Jerry Lewis.\" Placed in the context of the conservative era, his antics were radical and liberating, paving the way for future comedians Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Andy Kaufman, Paul Reubens, and Jim Carrey. Carrey wrote: \"Through his comedy, Jerry would stretch the boundaries of reality so far that it was an act of anarchy ... I learned from Jerry\", and \"I am because he was\".\n\nActing the bumbling and stammering 'everyman', Lewis used tightly choreographed, sophisticated sight gags, physical routines, verbal double-talk and malapropisms. \"You cannot help but notice Lewis' incredible sense of control in regards to performing—they may have looked at times like the ravings of a madman but his best work had a genuine grace and finesse behind it that would put most comedic performers of any era to shame.\" They are \"choreographed as exactly as any ballet, each movement and gesture coming on natural beats and conforming to the overall rhythmic form which is headed to a spectacular finale: absolute catastrophe.\"\n\nLewis' work, specifically his self-directed films, have warranted steady reappraisal. Richard Brody in \"The New Yorker\" said, Lewis was \"one of the most original, inventive, ... profound directors of the time.\" and \"one of the most skilled and original comic performers, verbal and physical, ever to appear on screen.\" Film critic and film curator for the Museum of Modern Art, Dave Kehr wrote in \"The New York Times\" of Lewis' \"fierce creativity\", \"the extreme formal sophistication of his direction\" and, Lewis was \". ... one of the great American filmmakers.\"\n\n\"Lewis was an explosive experimenter with a dazzling skill, and an audacious, innovatory flair for the technique of the cinema. He knew how to frame and present his own adrenaline-fuelled, instinctive physical comedy for the camera.\"\n\nLewis was in the forefront in the transition to independent filmmaking, which came to be known as New Hollywood in the late 1960s. Writing for the \"Los Angeles Times\" in 2005, screenwriter David Weddle lauded Lewis' audacity in 1959 \"daring to declare his independence from the studio system.\" Lewis came along to a studio system in which the industry was regularly stratified between players and coaches. The studios tightly controlled the process and they wanted their people directing. Yet Lewis regularly led, often flouting the power structure to do so. \nControl over material was smart business, and it was also good art. Neither the entrepreneur nor the auteur were common types among actors in mid-20th century Hollywood. But there Lewis was, at a time of strict studio control, doing both.\nNo other comedic star, with the exceptions of Chaplin and Keaton in the silent era, dared to direct himself. \"Not only would Lewis' efforts as a director pave the way for the likes of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen, but it would reveal him to be uncommonly skilled in that area as well.\" \"Most screen comedies until that time were not especially cinematic—they tended to plop down the camera where it could best capture the action and that was it. Lewis, on the other hand, was interested in exploring the possibilities of the medium by utilizing the tools he had at his disposal in formally innovative and oftentimes hilarious ways.\" \"In Lewis' work the way the scene is photographed is an integral part of the joke. His purposeful selection of lenses, for example, expands and contracts space to generate laughs that aren't necessarily inherent in the material, and he often achieves his biggest effects via what he leaves off screen, not just visually but structurally.\" \n\nAs a director, Lewis advanced the film comedy genre with innovations in the areas of fragmented narrative, experimental use of music and sound technology, and near surrealist use of color and art direction. This prompted his peer, filmmaker Jean Luc Godard to proclaim, \"Jerry Lewis ... is the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn't falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles. ... Lewis is the only one today who's making courageous films. He's been able to do it because of his personal genius\". Jim Hemphill for \"American Cinematheque\" wrote, \"They are films of ambitious visual and narrative experimentation, provocative and sometimes conflicted commentaries on masculinity in post-war America, and unsettling self-critiques and analyses of the performer's neuroses.\"\n\nIntensely personal and original, Lewis' films were groundbreaking in their use of dark humor for psychological exploration. Justin Chang of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said, \"The idea of comedians getting under the skin and tapping into their deepest, darkest selves is no longer especially novel, but it was far from a universally accepted notion when Lewis first took the spotlight. Few comedians before him had so brazenly turned arrested development into art, or held up such a warped fun house mirror to American identity in its loudest, ugliest, vulgarest excesses. Fewer still had advanced the still-radical notion that comedy doesn't always have to be funny, just fearless, in order to strike a nerve\".\n\nPre 1960, Hollywood comedies were screwball or farce. Lewis, from his earliest 'home movies, such as \"How to Smuggle a Hernia Across the Border\", made in his playhouse in the early 1950s, was one of the first to introduce satire as a full-length film. This \"sharp eyed\" satire continued in his mature work, commenting on the cult of celebrity, the machinery of 'fame', and \"the dilemma of being true to oneself while also fitting into polite society.\" Stephen Dalton in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote, Lewis had \"an agreeably bitter streak, offering self-lacerating insights into celebrity culture which now look strikingly modern. Even post-modern in places.\" Speaking of \"The King of Comedy\", \"More contemporary satirists like Garry Shandling, Steve Coogan and Ricky Gervais owe at least some of their self-deconstructing chops to Lewis' generously unappetizing turn in Scorsese's cult classic.\"\n\nLewis was an early master of deconstruction to enhance comedy. From the first \"Comedy Hour\"s he exposed the artifice of on stage performance by acknowledging the lens, sets, malfunctioning props, failed jokes, and tricks of production. As Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote: Lewis had \"the impulse to deconstruct and even demolish the fictional \"givens\" of any particular sketch, including those that he might have dreamed up himself, a kind of perpetual auto-destruction that becomes an essential part of his filmmaking as he steadily gains more control over the writing and direction of his features.\" His self directed films abound in behind-the-scene reveals, demystifying movie-making. Daniel Fairfax writes in \"Deconstructing Jerry: Lewis as a Director\", \"Lewis deconstructs the very functioning of the joke itself\". ... quoting Chris Fujiwara, \"\"The Patsy\" is a film so radical that it makes comedy out of the situation of a comedian who isn't funny.\" The final scene of \"The Patsy\" is famous for revealing to the audience the movie as a movie, and Lewis as actor/director. Lewis wrote in \"The Total Filmmaker\", his belief in breaking the fourth wall, actors looking directly into the camera, despite industry norms. More contemporary comedies such as \"The Larry Sanders Show\", \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", and \"The Office\" continue this method.\n\nRobert DeNiro and Sandra Bernhard (both of whom starred with Lewis in \"The King of Comedy\") reflected on his death, Bernhard said, \"It was one of the great experiences of my career, he was tough but one of a kind\". De Niro said, \"Jerry was a pioneer in comedy and film. And he was a friend. I was fortunate to have seen him a few times over the past couple of years. Even at 91, he didn't miss a beat ... or a punchline. You'll be missed.\" There was also a New York Friars Club roast in honor of Lewis with Sarah Silverman and Amy Schumer. Martin Scorsese recalls working with him on \"The King of Comedy\", \"It was like watching a virtuoso pianist at the keyboard\". Lewis was the subject of a documentary \"Jerry Lewis: Method to the Madness\".\n\nPeter Chelsom, director of \"Funny Bones\" wrote, \"Working with him was a masterclass in comic acting – and in charm. From the outset he was generous.\" \"There's a very thin line between a talent for being funny and being a great actor. Jerry Lewis epitomised that. Jerry embodied the term \"funny bones\": a way of differentiating between comedians who \"tell\" funny and those who \"are\" funny.\" Director Daniel Noah recalling his relationship with Lewis during production of \"Max Rose\" wrote, \"He was kind and loving and patient and limitlessly generous with his genius. He was unbelievably complicated and shockingly self-aware.\"\n\nActor and comedian Jeffrey Tambor wrote after Lewis' death, \"You invented the whole thing. Thank you doesn't even get close.\"\n\nThere have been numerous retrospectives of Lewis' films in the U.S. and abroad, most notably \"Jerry Lewis: A Film and Television Retrospective\" at Museum of the Moving Image, the 2013 Viennale, the 2016 Melbourne International Film Festival, \"The Innovator: Jerry Lewis at Paramount\", at American Cinematheque in Los Angeles, and \"Happy Birthday Mr. Lewis: The Kid Turns 90\", at MOMA. \nLewis is one of the few performers to have touched every aspect of 20th Century American entertainment, appearing in vaudeville, burlesque, the 'borsht belt', nightclubs, radio, Classical Hollywood Cinema (The 'Golden Age'), Las Vegas, television: variety, drama, sit-coms and talk shows, Broadway and independent films.\n\nOn August 21, 2017, multiple hotel marquees on the Las Vegas Strip honored Lewis with a coordinated video display of images of his career as a Las Vegas performer and resident. From 1949, as part of Martin and Lewis, and from 1956 as a solo, Lewis was a casino showroom headliner, playing numerous dates over the decades. It was also the home for the annual Labor Day MDA telethon.\n\nIn \"The Simpsons\", the character of Professor Frink is based on Lewis' Julius Kelp from \"The Nutty Professor.\" In \"Family Guy,\" Peter recreates Lewis' 'Chairman of the Board' scene from \"The Errand Boy\". Comedian, actor and friend of Lewis, Martin Short satirized him on the series \"SCTV\" in the sketches \"The Nutty Lab Assistant\", \"Martin Scorsese presents Jerry Lewis Live on the Champs Elysees!\", \"The Tender Fella\", and \"Scenes From an Idiots Marriage\", as well as on \"Saturday Night Live\"s \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\". Also on \"SNL\", the Martin and Lewis reunion on the 1976 MDA Telethon is reported by Chevy Chase on Weekend Update. Comedians Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo both parodied Lewis when he hosted SNL in 1983.\n\nComedian and actor Jim Carrey satirized Lewis on \"In Living Color\" in the sketch \"Jheri's Kids Telethon\". Carrey had an uncredited cameo playing Lewis in the series \"Buffalo Bill\" on the episode \"Jerry Lewis Week\". He also played Lewis, with impersonator Rich Little as Dean Martin, on stage. Actor Sean Hayes portrayed Lewis in the made-for-TV movie \"Martin and Lewis\", with Jeremy Northam as Dean Martin. Actor Kevin Bacon plays the Lewis character in the 2005 film \"Where The Truth Lies,\" based on a fictionalized version of Martin and Lewis. In the satiric novel, \"Funny Men\", about singer/wild comic double act, the character Sigmund \"Ziggy\" Blissman, is based on Lewis.\n\nJohn Saleeby, writer for \"National Lampoon\" has a humor piece \"Ten Things You Should Know About Jerry Lewis\".\nIn the animated cartoon \"Popeye's 20th Anniversary\", Martin and Lewis are portrayed on the dais. In 1998, The MTV animated show \"Celebrity Deathmatch\" had a clay-animated fight to the death between Dean Martin and Lewis. In a 1975 re-issue of \"MAD Magazine\" the contents of Lewis' wallet is satirized in their on-going feature \"Celebrities' Wallets\".\n\nLewis, and Martin & Lewis, as himself or his films, have been referenced by directors and performers of differing genres spanning decades, including, Blake Edwards's \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" (1960), Andy Warhol's Soap Opera (1964), John Frankenheimer's \"I Walk the Line\" (1970), Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\" (1972), Randal Kleiser's \"Grease\" (1978), Rainer Werner Fassbinder's \"In a Year of 13 Moons\" (1978), Quentin Tarantino's Four Rooms (1995), Martin Scorsese's \"Gangs of New York\" (2002), Hitchcock (2012), Ben Stiller's \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" (2013), Jay Roach's \"Trumbo\" (2015), \"The Comedians\" (2015), \"Baskets\" (2016) and \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" (2017).\n\nSimilarly, varied musicians have mentioned Lewis in song lyrics including, Ice Cube, The Dead Milkmen, Queen Latifah, and Frank Zappa. The hip hop music band Beastie Boys have an unreleased single \"The Jerry Lewis\", which they mention, and danced to, on stage in Asheville, North Carolina in 2009. In their film \"Paul's Boutique - A Visual Companion\", clips from \"The Nutty Professor\" play to . In 1986, the comedy radio show \"Dr. Demento\" aired a parody of \"Rock Me Amadeus\", \"Rock Me Jerry Lewis\".\n\nApple IOS 10 includes an auto-text emoji for 'professor' with a Lewis lookalike portrayal from \"The Nutty Professor\". 🤓\nThe word \"flaaaven!\", with its many variations and rhymes, is a Lewis-ism often used as a misspoken word or a person's mis-pronounced name. In a 2016 episode of the podcast \"West Wing Weekly\", Joshua Malina is heard saying \"flaven\" when trying to remember a character's correct last name. Lewis' signature catchphrase \"Hey, Laaady!\" is ubiquitously used by comedians and laypersons alike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40644081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40644081", "title": "Konrul", "text": "Konrul\n\nIn Turkic mythology, Konrul or Kongrul / Konqrul (\"Koñrul\", Azerbaijani: \"Qonrul\") is a long-lived bird that is cyclically regenerated or reborn.\n\nIn Turkish folklore, Konrul refers to a supernatural bird, often glossed as, or identified with, the Greek Phoenix or Persian \"Simurg\" (in Turkish languages Semrük).\n\nKonrul is depicted as a winged creature in the shape of a bird, gigantic enough to carry off an elephant. It appears as a peacock with the head of a dog and the claws of a lion; sometimes however also with a human face. It has an enmity towards snakes and its natural habitat is a place with plenty of water. Its feathers are said to be the colour of copper, and though it was originally described as being a Dog-Bird, later it was shown with either the head of a dog.\n\nIn Turkic culture Konrul has a twin and its name is Toghrul (Turul). In one of the folk tales, a hero rescues Konruls offspring by killing a snake that was crawling up the tree to feed upon them. As a reward, Konrul gives him three of her feathers which the hero can use to call her for help by burning them. Later the hero uses the feathers, and the Konrul carries him to a distant land. In the other tale, Konrul carries the hero out of the netherworld; here Konrul feeds its young with its teats.\n\nTurul and Konrul are twin birds in Turkish mythology. They known also Buğdayık and Kumayık or Semrük and Kerkes and sometimes Züzülö and Öksökö. They roosted in Tree of Life, which stands in the middle of the world. The relationship between the Turul and Konrul is extremely close.\n\nAnka also spelled Ankha, also known as Angha (Persian: عنقا), is a benevolent, mythical flying creature and common figure in Middle East cultures. The figure can be found in all periods of Greater Iranian art and literature, and is evident also in the iconography of medieval Armenia, the Byzantine empire, and other regions that were within the sphere of Persian cultural influence. The mythical bird is also found in the mythology of the Turkic peoples of Central Asia and is called \"Semrug, Semurg, Samran and Samruk\". Simurgh is shortened to \"Sīmīr\" in the Kurdish language.\n\nKonrul also goes by the name of \"Zumrud\" (emerald). It was an ancient tale about Malik Mammad, the son of one of the wealthiest kings of Azerbaijan. That king had a big garden. In the center of this garden is a magical apple tree which yields apples every day. One ugly giant called Div decides to steal all the apples every night. The king sends Malik Mammad and his elder brothers fight the giant. In the middle of this tale Malik Mammad saves Zumrud's babies from a dragon. Zumrud takes pleasure of Malik Mammad and decides to help him. When Malik Mammad wants to pass from The Dark world into the Light world Zumrud asks him to provide 40 half carcasses of meat and 40 wineskin filled with water. When Zumrud puts water on its left wing and meat on its right wing Malik Mammad is able to enter the Light world.\n\n"}
{"id": "926922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=926922", "title": "Man-Thing", "text": "Man-Thing\n\nThe Man-Thing (Dr. Theodore \"Ted\" Sallis) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writers Stan Lee, Roy Thomas, and Gerry Conway and artist Gray Morrow, the character first appeared in \"Savage Tales\" #1 (May 1971), and went on to be featured in various titles and in his own series, including \"Adventure into Fear\", which introduced the character Howard the Duck.\n\nSteve Gerber's 39-issue run on the series is considered to be a cult classic.\n\nMan-Thing is a large, slow-moving, empathic, humanoid swamp monster living in the Florida Everglades near a Seminole reservation and the fictitious town of Citrusville in Cypress County, Florida. Conan Stevens portrayed the character in the 2005 film \"Man-Thing\".\n\nAs described in the text featurette \"The Story Behind the Scenes\" in \"Savage Tales\" #1 (cover-dated May 1971), the black-and-white adventure fantasy magazine in which the character debuted in an 11-page origin story, Man-Thing was conceived in discussions between Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee and writer Roy Thomas, and that together they created five possible origins. Lee provided the name, which had previously been used for unrelated creatures in Marvel's early science-fiction/fantasy anthology \"Tales of Suspense\" #7 (Jan. 1960) and #81 (Sept. 1966), as well as the concept of the man losing sentience.\n\nAs Thomas recalled in 2002:\nThomas worked out a detailed plot and gave it to Gerry Conway to script. Thomas and Conway are credited as writers, with Gray Morrow as artist. A second story, written by Len Wein and drawn by Neal Adams, was prepared at that time, but, upon \"Savage Tales\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> cancellation after that single issue, \"took a year or two to see print\", according to Thomas. That occurred in \"Astonishing Tales\" #12 (June 1972), in which the seven-page story was integrated in its entirety within the 21-page feature \"Ka-Zar\", starring Marvel's jungle-lord hero. This black-and-white interlude (with yellow highlighting) segued to Man-Thing's introduction to color comics as Ka-Zar's antagonist-turned-ally in this and the following issue (both written by Thomas, with the first penciled by John Buscema and the second by Buscema and Rich Buckler).\n\nThe Wein-written Man-Thing story appeared in between Wein's first and second version of his DC Comics character Swamp Thing. Wein was Conway's roommate at the time, and as Thomas recalled in 2008,\n\nMan-Thing received his own 10-page feature, again by Conway (with Morrow inking pencils by Howard Chaykin), in \"Adventure into Fear\" #10 (Oct. 1972), sharing that anthological title with reprinted 1950s horror/fantasy stories. Steve Gerber, who would become Man-Thing's signature writer, succeeded Conway the following issue, with art by Rich Buckler (Mayerik began with issue #13). The feature expanded to 15 pages with #12 (art by Jim Starlin), became 16 pages two issues later, and reached the then-standard 19-page length of Marvel superhero comics with issue #15, at which point the series also went from bi-monthly to monthly. In \"Fear\" #11 (Dec. 1972), page 11, Gerber created the series' narrative tagline, used in captions: \"Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch!\"\nAfter issue #19 (Dec.1973), Man-Thing received a solo title \"The Man-Thing\", which ran 22 issues (Jan. 1974 - Oct. 1975). Following Morrow, the main series' primary pencillers were, successively, Val Mayerik, Mike Ploog, John Buscema, and Jim Mooney.\n\nA sister publication was the larger, quarterly \"Giant-Size Man-Thing\" #1-5 (August 1974 - August 1975), which featured 1950s horror-fantasy and 1960s science fiction/monster reprints as back-up stories, with a two-part Howard the Duck co-feature added in the final two issues. The unintentional double entendre in this sister series' title has become a recurring joke among comics readers.\n\nIn the final issue, writer Gerber appeared as a character in the story, claiming he had not been inventing the Man-Thing's adventures but simply reporting on them and that he had decided to move on. Gerber continued to write Man-Thing guest appearances in other Marvel titles, as well as the serialized, eight-page Man-Thing feature in the omnibus series \"Marvel Comics Presents\" #1-12 (Sept. 1988 - Feb. 1989), and a supporting role in \"The Evolutionary War\", coming to the aid of Spider-Man. Gerber also wrote a graphic novel that Kevin Nowlan spent many years illustrating, but he did not live to see it published.\n\nA second \"Man-Thing\" series ran 11 issues (Nov. 1979 - Jan. 1981). Writer Michael Fleisher and penciller Mooney teamed for the first three issues, with the letters page of #3 noting that Fleisher's work had received a great deal of negative criticism and that he had been taken off the book. He was succeeded by, primarily, writer Chris Claremont and illustrators Don Perlin (breakdowns) and Bob Wiacek (finished pencils). Claremont's stories introduced Man-Thing and Jennifer Kale to Doctor Strange (whose series he was concurrently writing), after which his material focused on two new supporting characters: John Daltry, Citrusville's new sheriff, and Bobbie Bannister, a formerly wealthy girl who is the only survivor when her parents' yacht is attacked. These characters' stories he resolved by tying them to a resolution for his own \"War Is Hell\" series.\n\nBlack and white Man-Thing stories, and some color covers, also appeared in the Marvel magazine \"Monsters Unleashed\" as well.\n\nSimon Jowett provided a Man-Thing story in \"Marvel Comics Presents\" #164-168 (Early Oct.-Late Nov. 1994). The story was set soon after Sallis' transformation, yet depicted Sallis using a standard personal computer with up-to-date graphics rather than hard-copy files, an example of the floating timeline effect.\n\nJ.M. DeMatteis began writing the character in a backup story in \"Man-Thing\" (vol. 2) #9 (March 1981), which opened with a fill-in by Dickie McKenzie. DeMatteis would go on to write Man-Thing stories in \"Marvel Team-Up\", \"The Defenders\", \"Marvel Fanfare\", and the miniseries \"Daydreamers\", as well as \"Man-Thing\" (vol. 3) #1-8 (Dec. 1997 - July 1998), illustrated by Liam Sharp. The two would re-team for the Man-Thing feature in \"Strange Tales\" (vol. 4) #1-2 (Sept.-Oct. 1998). Four issues were written, but #3 and 4 were never published. Their stories were summarized briefly in \" Annual '99\", also by DeMatteis, with art by Sharp and others.\n\nIn the 2000s, Man-Thing has starred in a handful of stories appearing in one-shots and miniseries, including \"Marvel Knights Double Shot\" #2 (July 2002) by Ted McKeever, and \"Legion of Monsters: Man-Thing\" #1 (May 2007) by Charlie Huston and Klaus Janson.\n\nIn 2008, writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa retold Man-Thing's origin in \"Dead of Night featuring the Man-Thing\" #1-4 (April–July 2008), from the Marvel MAX imprint. This was followed by an eight-page story in \"Marvel Comics Presents\" (vol. 2) #12 (Oct. 2008), by writer Jai Nitz and artist Ben Stenbeck.\n\nMan-Thing appeared regularly during The Punisher's \"Franken-Castle\" story arc and became a regular member of \"Thunderbolts\" with issue #144. The series was retitled \"Dark Avengers\" with #175, and Man-Thing continued to appear as a regular character until issue #183. Steve Gerber's posthumous Man-Thing story \"The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man\", with art by Kevin Nowlan, originally planned as a 1980s graphic novel before being left uncompleted by the artist, was revived in the 2010s and appeared as a three-issue miniseries cover-titled \"The Infernal Man-Thing\" (Early Sept.-Oct. 2012). The story was a sequel to Gerber's \"Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man\" in \"Man-Thing\" #12 (Dec. 1974).\n\nAuthor R.L. Stine made his comics debut with a five-issue \"Man-Thing\" miniseries in 2017.\n\nYoung biochemist Dr. Theodore \"Ted\" Sallis, a native of Omaha, Nebraska, is working in the Everglades as part of Dr. Wilma Calvin's Project: Gladiator team, which includes Dr. Barbara Morse and her fiancé Dr. Paul Allen. A Dr. Wendell is later cited as being on the staff after Dr. Calvin is shot. The group is attempting to recreate the super-soldier serum that had created Captain America. \"Web of Spider-Man\" (vol. 2) #6 revealed that Sallis at one point treated and worked alongside Dr. Curt Connors shortly after Connors' arm was amputated, driving the research that would eventually transform Connors into the Lizard.\n\nThough warned that the technological terrorist group Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.) has been operating in the area, Sallis breaches security by bringing with him his lover, Ellen Brandt (referred to here as \"Miss Brandt\", but later retconned to be his wife). He destroys his notes to his formula, which he has memorized. Later, he is ambushed and learns Brandt has betrayed him. Fleeing with the only sample of his serum, he injects himself with it in hopes of saving himself. However, he crashes his car into the swamp where chemical and, as \"Man-Thing\" #1 later explained, magical forces instantly transform him into a slow-moving plant-matter creature with large, solid red eyes, Unable to speak, and with dim memories, he attacks the ambushers and Brandt, burning and scarring part of her face with an acid he now secretes in the presence of violent emotions. The Man-Thing then wanders away into the swamp.\n\nSallis' mind was apparently extinguished, although on rare occasions he could briefly return to consciousness within his monstrous form, as in \"Doctor Strange\" (vol. 2) #41 (June 1980) and \"Peter Parker: Spider-Man Annual '99\", and even to his human form, as in \"Adventure into Fear\" #13 (April 1973), \"Marvel Two-in-One\" #1 (Jan. 1974), \"Marvel Comics Presents\" #164 (Oct. 1994), and \"Man-Thing\" (vol. 3) #5 and #7-8 (April 1998, June–July 1998).\n\nUnder writer Steve Gerber, the Man-Thing encounters the sorceress Jennifer Kale, with whom he briefly shared a psychic link and who knew his true identity, in a story arc in \"Fear\" #11-13 — the final issue of which established that the swamp had mystical properties as the Nexus of All Realities. Through an interdimensional portal in \"Fear\" #19, he meets Howard the Duck, who becomes stranded in this reality. Man-Thing became the guardian of the Nexus, and found himself facing demons, ghosts and time-traveling warriors, while continuing to encounter such non-supernatural antagonists as rapacious land developers, fascist vigilantes and common criminals. He formed a bond with young radio DJ Richard Rory and nurse Ruth Hart. Issue #12's \"Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man\", about an institutionalized writer named Brian Lazarus, spawned Gerber's posthumously published 2012 sequel, \"The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man\", in the three-issue miniseries \"The Infernal Man-Thing\".\n\nIn \"Man-Thing\" (vol. 2) #1-11 (Nov. 1979 - July 1981), writer Chris Claremont introduced himself as a character in the final issue, as Gerber had in the finale of the first series. Additionally, Claremont temporarily \"became\" the Man-Thing after being stabbed to death. His and other characters' deaths were later resolved with the intervention of the \"War Is Hell\" series lead, John Kowalski, now an aspect of Marvel Comics' manifestation of Death. In \"Man-Thing\" (vol. 3) #1-8 (Dec. 1997 - July 1998), Ellen Brandt Sallis returns to the Citrusville area and encounters a little boy, Job Burke, who is actually the Sallis' son, who had been put up for adoption. Following this series, the story continued in \"Strange Tales\" (vol. 4) #1-2, and was projected to continue in the unpublished issues #3-4. Summaries based on DeMatteis' unillustrated scripts appear on the K'Ad-mon and Ellen Brandt pages in Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe.\n\nDuring the \"Civil War\" storyline, two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents unsuccessfully attempt to register the Man-Thing with the Superhuman Registration Act. Man-Thing later appears as a member of the Legion of Monsters alongside Morbius, the Living Vampire, Werewolf by Night, Manphibian, and N'Kantu, the Living Mummy. He later gains the ability to speak comprehensibly through the use of the \"Universal Language\". Phil Coulson subsequently recruits Man-Thing for his incarnation of the Howling Commandos. As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel branding, Man-Thing appears as a member of S.T.A.K.E.'s Howling Commandos.\n\nMan-Thing is a former scientist who was transformed into a creature composed of vegetable matter through the synergistic interaction of mystical energy and swamp mutagens. Though the beast now lacks a normal human intellect and has shed any desire to communicate with human society, it nevertheless often becomes an accidental hero as it stumbles upon various crime and horror scenarios.\n\nIn the pages of \"The Thunderbolts\", Dr. Henry Pym has expressed the view that the Man-Thing is sentient, though difficult to communicate with. For example, he once rescued an infant and left the child with a doctor (which would require an understanding of the function of a doctor and the ability to navigate to a specific address). He is shown to understand concepts such as how to ring a doorbell, how to put an arm in a sling, and even how to flip an auto-destruct switch. The change in Man-Thing's intellect can partly be explained by fact that its brain, sensory organs, and central nervous system are now organized in a completely different fashion than a human's; for instance, Man-Thing's auditory receptors are in his forehead. Regardless of what level of humanity the creature still possesses, it can discern when a person's motivations are evil, which causes it pain and motivates it to lash out.\n\nThe Man-Thing possesses a variety of superhuman powers, described below, that are derived from the interaction of the scientific formula created by Ted Sallis and the mystical energies of the Nexus of Realities.\n\nIt is able to sense human emotions, and is enraged by fear and automatically secretes a poisonous chemical; anyone feeling fear and clutched by the Man-Thing is prone to be burned (either chemically or mystically), hence the series' tagline: \"Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch!\" Though fear is understandably most people's response to the creature, both for his monstrous appearance and the physical danger of his touch, typically only villains end up meeting an immolating death at its hands. Many survive being burned, notably Ellen Brandt, Kurt \"Nightcrawler\" Wagner (whom he does not even scar), and Mongu, whose hand he permanently attaches to his axe, either due to intervention or dissipation. Unusual psychic and mystical forces react in what passes as the \"brain\" cells located throughout his body. These unique forces render the Man-Thing extremely sensitive to emotions. Emotions that are mild and generally considered positive arouse curiosity and the Man-Thing will sometimes observe from a distance. However, emotions that are often viewed as negative, such as violent emotions like anger, hatred and fear, cause the Man-Thing great discomfort and might provoke him to attack. Once provoked into violent actions, his body secretes highly concentrated acid that can burn human beings to ashes within a matter of seconds. Even individuals that have high levels of superhuman durability have proven unable to withstand this potent acid. While the Man-Thing is devoid of violent emotions, his body produces a type of foamy, soapy mucus that neutralizes the acid.\n\nAlthough Man-Thing's superhuman strength, speed, intelligence, durability, immortality, give the monster powers it is his spiritual ability that makes him immune to any other disease, it has been established that the creature possesses physical stamina beyond the limitations of any human athlete. Initially, the Man-Thing is only slightly stronger than Captain America, but in later appearances, the Man-Thing possesses sufficient superhuman strength to stand toe-to-toe with much stronger villains. He is able to lift a 2,000 pound automobile when sufficiently moved to do so.\n\nThe Man-Thing's body is practically invulnerable to harm. Because his body is not entirely solid, but composed of the muck and vegetative matter of the swamp, fists, bullets, knives, energy blasts, etc. will either pass entirely through him or will harmlessly be lodged within his body. Even if a vast portion of the Man-Thing's body were to be ripped away or incinerated, he would be able to reorganize himself by drawing the necessary material from the surrounding vegetation. Devil-Slayer once sliced him nearly in half, and he has survived being incinerated by a Celestial, although his healing from the latter has been the longest and most complex in his lifetime.\n\nDue to the construction of his body, the Man-Thing is able to ooze his body through openings or around barriers that would seem too small for him to pass through. The smaller the opening, the longer it will take for him to reorganize his mass upon reaching the other side. This ability can be defeated mystically.\n\nThe Man-Thing was once dependent upon the swamp he inhabits for his continued survival; his body would slowly weaken and eventually lapse into dormancy if not returned to the swamp or would be greatly damaged if exposed to clean water. His exposure to the Citrusville waste treatment plant greatly enhanced his ability to leave the swamp, as he became a self-contained ecosystem, feeding off of his own waste products. He generally leaves the swamp of his own accord only if he senses a mystical disturbance. Man-Thing has also demonstrated himself susceptible to possession by other entities.\n\nAlthough the Man-Thing lacks a normal human intellect, in his life as Ted Sallis, he possessed a Ph.D. in biochemistry. Sallis is legally dead, but his identity is known to numerous living people, including Wilma Calvin, Ellen Brandt, Stephen Strange, Owen Reece, Ben Grimm, Thog the Nether-Spawn, Jennifer Kale, and anyone they may have told or written to about it. His identity as Man-Thing could not be considered secret, but his existence is generally believed to be a hoax, and an obscure one at that. In-universe, knowledge of his existence is rarely tied to the experiments of Sallis, as are speculations as to any human identity he may have had. Despite having appeared in Citrusville many times, many there still believe him to be a rumor.\n\nThere were other known Man-Things in the comics besides Ted Sallis:\n\n\nDr. Barbara \"Bobbi\" Morse was introduced in the second Man-Thing story by Len Wein/Neal Adams, although because of publication delays, she was introduced in \"Astonishing Tales\" #6, with the Wein/Adams story presented as flashback. Morse became the costumed hero Mockingbird in \"Marvel Team-Up\" #95 and went on to become a prominent member of Avengers West Coast, eventually sacrificing her life to save her husband, Clint \"Hawkeye\" Barton, from Mephisto. Until recently, her spirit fought alongside Daimon Hellstrom to eliminate demons from his Hell; however, she has appeared alive during the \"Secret Invasion\" crossover event. At the end of \"Secret Invasion\", Mockingbird was revealed to be alive and had been one of the early captures of the Skrulls. Morse has joined the New Avengers and has had adventures alongside Hawkeye.\n\nJennifer Kale debuted in \"Fear\" #11, which was the first story Steve Gerber wrote for Marvel after his initial tryout. She went on to appear in two team books, \"The Legion of Night\", created and written by Gerber and partially composed of several other Gerber-created supporting cast members such as Martin Gold and Dr. Katherine Reynolds, and Bronwyn Carlton and Bryan Walsh's \"Witches\" in which she teamed with Satana and Topaz under the tutelage of Doctor Strange.\n\nGerber introduced Howard the Duck in a Man-Thing story in \"Adventure into Fear\" #19. Howard, who was displaced from a planet of anthropomorphics in another dimension via the swamp's Nexus of All Realities, later acquired his own series, which was written by Gerber for the first 27 issues.\n\nThe Foolkiller, a vigilante who used a ray-gun to disintegrate not only criminals but anyone he considered foolish, was introduced in issue #3 of this series, bent on slaying disc jockey Richard Rory, introduced in the previous issue. When Rory served time for trumped-up kidnapping charges, he accidentally created another Foolkiller when he revealed too much detail about the previous incarnation and the whereabouts of his gear. This Foolkiller became an occasional villain in other Marvel comics. Both Rory and this second Foolkiller, along with nurse Ruth Hart (who appeared in \"Man-Thing\" # 2-7) were supporting characters in Gerber's \"Omega the Unknown\", while David Anthony Kraft made Rory a potential love interest for She-Hulk. A third version of the character, who was in Internet communication with the second, starred in Gerber's 1990 \"Foolkiller\" miniseries. A second series by Greg Hurwitz, featuring a fourth Foolkiller, appeared in 2008.\n\nIn \"The Adventures of the X-Men\", which is based on the \"X-Men\" animated series, Storm and Jean Grey are inadvertently teleported to Man-Thing's swamp from the Mojoverse. The three battle D'Spayre, who appears as a fake preacher trying to lead people up a suicide tower that is drawing energy out of the Nexus of All Realities. D'Spayre, working for the Dweller-in-Darkness, is burned by Man-Thing when he fears failure. After their defeat of D'Spayre, Jean makes a psychic link with Man-Thing (which she had done earlier to learn his origin) and is imparted information that she believes is the most important thing in the world. Jean is forced to become the Phoenix once more, using the information obtained from Man-Thing, destroys the M'Kraan Crystal, and in doing so, ends the universe. However, one survivor is sent into the universe to come, Galactus, thereby implying that the animation continuity takes place eons before the mainstream Marvel continuity.\n\nThe \"Mutant X\" comic book series depicts a Marvel Universe in which characters' counterparts are vastly different. In the \"Mutant X Annual '99\" (1999), Doctor Strange, the sorcerer supreme of Earth, reveals himself to be the Man-Thing. He returns in \"Mutant X Annual '01\" (2001), and \"Mutant X\" #32 (June 2001).\n\n\"Amazing Adventures\" (vol. 2) #38 tells the story of what happened when Killraven stumbled across the Miami Museum of Cultural Development and became caught up in the projected dreams of an astronaut from the \"Mars launch in 1999.\" During the hallucination, Killraven encountered distorted versions of numerous Marvel characters. Rather ambiguously, the awakened astronaut later described the figures as \"all the heroes from my youth\" but he also often referred to them as \"myths\". The only Marvel character that is definitely \"real\" in the projected nightmare is the Man-Thing who appears as part of an actual memory of an encounter that the astronaut had with the creature in the Florida Everglades.\n\nMan-Thing appears in issue #10 of \"Marvel Super Hero Squad\".\n\nMan-Thing appears in the last issue and appears to be standing guard over all creation. It ultimately accepts Deadpool's plan and kills the Taskmaster.\n\nUltimate Man-Thing, in the alternate-universe \"Ultimate Marvel\" imprint, is similar to his traditional counterpart in mainstream continuity. In his first appearance, he teamed with Spider-Man in \"Ultimate Marvel Team Up\" #10, unwittingly saving the superhero from the Lizard. Additionally, in \"Ultimate Fantastic Four\" #7, during a flashback that transformed Reed Richards and his colleagues into the Fantastic Four, the Man-Thing is shown for a moment.\n\nThe second story in the alternate-reality anthology \"What If\" #26 (April 1981) asked, \"What if the Man-Thing had Regained Ted Sallis' Brain?\" Written by Steven Grant, with art by penciller Herb Trimpe and inker Bob Wiacek. In the story, an alligator Dr. Oheimer was working on became the new Man-Thing while Sallis self-immolated at his own fear while fighting it.\n\n\"What If\" (vol. 2) #11 (March 1990) featured the Fantastic Four in four scenarios written and penciled by Jim Valentino, showing what might have happened if the team-members had all had the same powers as one another. In \"What if the Fantastic Four had All Become Monsters Like the Thing?\", Sue Storm's appearance was that of the Man-Thing. In this form she had lost all but her very basic intelligence and could no longer speak.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Man-Thing was ranked #7 on a listing of Marvel Comics' monster characters in 2015.\n\n"}

MEA is also related to means-ends chain approach used commonly in consumer behavior analysis. It is also a way to clarify one's thoughts when embarking on a mathematical proof.\n\nAn important aspect of intelligent behavior as studied in AI is \"goal-based\" problem solving, a framework in which the solution to a problem can be described by finding a sequence of \"actions\" that lead to a desirable goal. A goal-seeking system is supposed to be connected to its outside environment by sensory channels through which it receives information about the environment and motor channels through which it acts on the environment. (The term \"afferent\" is used to describe \"inward\" sensory flows, and \"efferent\" is used to describe \"outward\" motor commands.) In addition, the system has some means of storing in a \"memory\" information about the \"state\" of the environment (afferent information) and information about actions (efferent information). Ability to attain goals depends on building up associations, simple or complex, between particular changes in states and particular actions that will bring these changes about. Search is the process of discovery and assembly of sequences of actions that will lead from a given state to a desired state. While this strategy may be appropriate for machine learning and problem solving, it is not always suggested for humans (e.g. cognitive load theory and its implications).\n\nThe MEA technique is a strategy to control search in problem-solving. Given a current state and a goal state, an action is chosen which will reduce the \"difference\" between the two. The action is performed on the current state to produce a new state, and the process is recursively applied to this new state and the goal state.\n\nNote that, in order for MEA to be effective, the goal-seeking system must have a means of associating to any kind of detectable difference those actions that are relevant to reducing that difference. It must also have means for detecting the progress it is making (the changes in the differences between the actual and the desired state), as some attempted sequences of actions may fail and, hence, some alternate sequences may be tried.\n\nWhen knowledge is available concerning the importance of differences, the most important difference is selected first to further improve the average performance of MEA over other brute-force search strategies. However, even without the ordering of differences according to importance, MEA improves over other search heuristics (again in the average case) by focusing the problem solving on the actual differences between the current state and that of the goal.\n\nThe MEA technique as a problem-solving strategy was first introduced in 1961 by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon in their computer problem-solving program General Problem Solver (GPS). In that implementation, the correspondence between differences and actions, also called \"operators\", is provided a priori as knowledge in the system. (In GPS this knowledge was in the form of \"table of connections\".)\n\nWhen the action and side-effects of applying an operator are penetrable the search may select the relevant operators by inspection of the operators and do without a table of connections. This latter case, of which the canonical example is STRIPS, an automated planning computer program, allows task-independent correlation of differences to the operators which reduce them.\n\nProdigy, a problem solver developed in a larger learning-assisted automated planning project started at Carnegie Mellon University by Jaime Carbonell, Steven Minton and Craig Knoblock, is another system that used MEA.\n\nProfessor Morten Lind, at Technical University of Denmark has developed a tool called multilevel flow modeling (MFM). It performs means-end based diagnostic reasoning for industrial control and automation systems.\n\n"}

Melias is mentioned in the sources only during the early reign of John I Tzimiskes (reigned 969–976), but is depicted on horseback along with Tzimiskes in the so-called \"Pigeon House\" church (cf. Churches of Göreme) at Çavuşin in Cappadocia, which was built and painted during the reign of Tzimiskes' predecessor Nikephoros II Phokas (r. 963–969) to commemorate him and his family. Melias' and Tzimiskes' presence is probably connected with their participation in Nikephoros II's conquest of Cilicia in 965. Although Melias is identified as a \"magistros\" in the \"Pigeon House\", this is a later emendation over the original inscription; he probably gained the rank of \"magistros\" at or after Tzimiskes' accession. \n\nMelias is mentioned in the sources as a participant in the expeditions against the Arabs in Upper Mesopotamia in 972–973. The first expedition, in autumn and winter of 972, was led by Tzimiskes in person and resulted in the capture of Nisibis and Mayyafariqin (Greek: Martyropolis), forcing the local Arab ruler, the Hamdanid emir Abu Taghlib, to agree to pay an annual tribute in exchange for the Byzantines' withdrawal. Tzimiskes then withdrew from the area, but left Melias in his stead as Domestic of the Schools of the East (commander-in-chief of the eastern field army). Melias then advanced against Amid with an army numbering, according to the Arab sources, 50,000 men. The commander of the local garrison, Hezarmerd, called upon Abu Taghlib for aid, and the latter sent his brother, Hibatallah, who arrived before the city on 4 July 973. On the next day, a battle was fought before the walls of Amid in which the Byzantines were defeated. Melias and a group of other Byzantine generals were captured on the next day and brought captive to Abu Taghlib. \n\nMelias died soon after in captivity, but the sources disagree on the date and cause. The 11th-century historian Yahya of Antioch and Stephen of Taron record that he remained captive at Abu Taghlib's court until his death in February/March 974. The 13th-century Persian historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani on the other hand states that Melias died soon after the battle before Amid of his wounds. Ibn al-Athir and others record that he died in the year 363 AH (October 973 – September 974) of an illness, although Abu Taghlib had sent doctors to help him, while the less reliable accounts of Matthew of Edessa and Bar Hebraeus claim that he was brought to Baghdad, where he died from an ulcer.\n\n"}

One can thus get another possible world by taking a single thing away, and one does not need to add any other thing as its replacement. Then one can take another thing away, and another, until one is left with a possible world that is empty.\n\nAgainst the possible strength of this intuitive argument, some philosophers argue that there are necessarily some concrete objects. It is a consequence of David Kellogg Lewis's concrete modal realism that it is impossible that no concrete objects exist; for since worlds are concrete, there is at least one concrete object—the world itself—at each world. E. J. Lowe has likewise argued that there are necessarily some concrete objects. His argument runs as follows: Necessarily, there are some abstract objects, such as numbers. The only possible abstract objects are sets or universals, but both of these depend on the existence of concrete objects (for sets, their members; for universals, the things that instantiate them). Therefore, there are necessarily some concrete objects.\n"}
{"id": "22469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22469", "title": "Ontogeny", "text": "Ontogeny\n\nOntogeny (also ontogenesis or morphogenesis) is the origination and development of an organism, usually from the time of fertilization of the egg to the organism's mature form—although the term can be used to refer to the study of the entirety of an organism's lifespan.\n\nOntogeny is the developmental history of an organism within its own lifetime, as distinct from phylogeny, which refers to the evolutionary history of a species. In practice, writers on evolution often speak of species as \"developing\" traits or characteristics. This can be misleading. While developmental (i.e., ontogenetic) processes can influence subsequent evolutionary (e.g., phylogenetic) processes (see evolutionary developmental biology), individual organisms develop (ontogeny), while species evolve (phylogeny).\n\nOntogeny, embryology and developmental biology are closely related studies and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. The term ontogeny has also been used in cell biology to describe the development of various cell types within an organism.\n\nOntogeny is a useful field of study in many disciplines, including developmental biology, developmental psychology, developmental cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychobiology.\n\nOntogeny is also a concept used in anthropology as \"the process through which each of us embodies the history of our own making\".\n\nThe word \"ontogeny\" comes from the Greek ὄν, \"on\" (gen. ὄντος, \"ontos\"), i.e. \"being; that which is\", which is the present participle of the verb εἰμί, \"eimi\", i.e. \"to be, I am\", and from the suffix \"-geny\" from the Greek -γένεια -\"geneia\", which expresses the concept of \"mode of production\".\n\nA seminal paper named ontogeny as one of the four primary questions of biology, along with Huxley's three others: causation, survival value and evolution. Tinbergen emphasized that the change of behavioral \"machinery\" during development was distinct from the change in behavior during development. \"We can conclude that the thrush itself, i.e. its behavioral machinery, has changed only if the behavior change occurred while the environment was held constant...When we turn from description to causal analysis, and ask in what way the observed change in behavior machinery has been brought about, the natural first step is to try and distinguish between environmental influences and those within the animal...In ontogeny the conclusion that a certain change is internally controlled (is \"innate\") is reached by \"elimination\". \" (p. 424) Tinbergen was concerned that the elimination of environmental factors is difficult to establish, and the use of the word \"innate\" is often misleading.\n\nMost organisms undergo allometric changes in shape as they grow and mature, while others engage in metamorphosis. Even \"reptiles\" (non-avian sauropsids, e.g., crocodilians, turtles, snakes, lizards), in which the offspring are often viewed as miniature adults, show a variety of ontogenetic changes in morphology and physiology.\n\nComparing ourselves to others is something humans do all the time. \"In doing so we are acknowledging not so much our sameness to others\nor our difference, but rather the commonality that resides in our difference. In other words, because each one of us is at once remarkably similar to, and remarkably different from, all other humans, it makes little sense to think of comparison in terms of a list of absolute similarities and a list of absolute differences. Rather, in respect of all other humans, we find similarities in the ways we are different from one another and differences in the ways we are the same. That we are able to do this is a function of the genuinely historical process that is human ontogeny\".\n\n\n"}

In 2008 in response to shareholder pressure, PDL spun out its active development programs to a company called Facet Biotech that it capitalized with $400 million.\n\nProtein Design Labs had been founded in 1986 and was a pioneer in humanizing monoclonal antibodies. Its humanization technology was used in several monoclonal antibody drugs under licensing and collaboration agreements; such products included rituximab (Rituxan), bevacizumab (Avastin), and palivizumab (Synagis). It held its initial public offering in 1992 and by 1994 it had 13 compounds in its pipeline, and had partnered its lead product, the humanized monoclonal antibody daclizumab, with Roche under a license that called for a 15% royalty. Daclizumab became the first humanized monoclonal antibody approved for human use in 1997. PDL made another public offering in 2000, at the peak of the biotech IPO window that ran from 1998 to 2001. In 2003 it settled litigation with Genentech over royalty payments owed to PDL under their license agreement; annual royalties were anticipated at that time to be around $90M per year. These are the kinds of intellectual property and license agreements that PDL manages on behalf of its shareholders since 2008; in 2007 those royalty payments were around $220 million.\n\nOne of the development programs that PDL had transferred to Facet was the use of daclizumab in indications it had never licensed to Roche, including multiple sclerosis. Facet partnered that development program with Biogen Idec which attempted a hostile buy out of Facet for $350M in 2009; Facet rejected that offer and was purchased by Abbvie for $450 million in cash the next year. The FDA approved daclizumab for multiple sclerosis in 2016 under the trade name Zinbryta.\n\n"}
{"id": "5019316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5019316", "title": "Pallid sturgeon", "text": "Pallid sturgeon\n\nThe pallid sturgeon (\"Scaphirhynchus albus\") is an endangered species of ray-finned fish, endemic to the waters of the Missouri and lower Mississippi river basins of the United States.\n\nNamed for its pale coloration, it is closely related to the relatively common shovelnose sturgeon (\"Scaphirhynchus platorynchus\"), but is much larger, averaging between in length and in weight at maturity. This species takes 15 years to mature and spawns infrequently, but can live up to a century. A member of the sturgeon family, Acipenseridae, which originated during the Cretaceous period 70 million years ago, the pallid sturgeon has changed little since then.\n\nIn 1990, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service placed the pallid sturgeon on its endangered species list because few young individuals had been observed in the preceding decade and sightings had greatly diminished; the species is now rarely seen in the wild. It was the first fish species in the Missouri River drainage area to be listed as endangered, and a loss of its habitat is thought to be responsible for its decline. The vast majority of the Missouri River drainage system has been channeled and dammed, reducing the gravel deposits and slow-moving side channels that are its favored spawning areas. Until the middle of the 20th century, pallid sturgeon were common and anglers found catching such a large fish in fresh water a rewarding experience. The species is considered to be good-tasting, and its eggs have been used as caviar, although less commonly than those of many other sturgeon.\n\nEfforts to prevent the species from becoming extinct have had modest success. Pallid sturgeon are actively being raised in a dozen hatcheries and the offspring are being released back to the wild every year. To better understand pallid sturgeon behavior, researchers have implanted radio transmitters to track their movements and help identify possible spawning areas. Federal and state agencies are working together to improve habitat by restoring spawning areas since restoration of these areas is required if the species is to survive in the wild.\n\nTaxonomists S. A. Forbes and R. E. Richardson classified the pallid sturgeon in 1905, grouping it in the genus \"Parascaphirhynchus\" and the family Acipenseridae, which includes all sturgeon worldwide. Its closest relatives are the shovelnose sturgeon (\"Scaphirhynchus platorynchus\"), which is still relatively common, and the critically endangered Alabama sturgeon (\"Scaphirhynchus suttkusi\"), which may soon become extinct. These three species belong to the subfamily Scaphirhynchinae, which has only one other genus, \"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\", represented by three species found in west-central Asia.\n\nThe word pallid means \"deficient in color\", and compared to other species of sturgeon, the pallid is noticeably paler. The scientific name for the fish is derived from \"Scaphirhynchus\", a Greek word meaning \"spade snout\" and \"albus\" which is Latin for \"white\".\n\nTo better protect the pallid sturgeon from extinction, research on its DNA and that of other closely related species was conducted to assess the differences within various populations of pallid sturgeon, and the differences between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. Early DNA research indicated that pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon were a single species. However, a 2000 study comparing DNA sequences in the three members of the genus \"Scaphirhynchus\"(pallid, shovelnose, and Alabama sturgeon) showed that the three are distinct species. Between 2001 and 2006, several studies examined two populations of pallid sturgeon located in the upper Great Plains section of the Missouri River and compared them to a southern population located in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana. These DNA studies concluded that the northern populations of pallid sturgeon are reproductively isolated and are genetically distinct from the Atchafalaya population. However, the genetic variability among pallid sturgeon was found to be far less than that between them and the shovelnose sturgeon.\n\nAnother reason for DNA testing was to determine the rates of hybridization between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The southern populations have more hybrids than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids. Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon. Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear to be the result of pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.\n\nThe pallid sturgeon is one of the largest freshwater fish species in North America. They are generally between in length and weigh as much as . The species is ancient and has remained virtually unchanged for 70 million years, since the Cretaceous period. The pallid sturgeon has a distinctive appearance that has been referred to as \"primitive\", \"dinosaur-like\" and even \"ugly\". Although visually similar, the shovelnose sturgeon is much smaller and usually weighs no more than . Pallid sturgeon are much paler in coloration with grayish white backs and sides, while shovelnose sturgeon are brown. Pallid sturgeon turn whiter as they age and younger specimens are easily confused with adult shovelnose sturgeon since they are similar in color. Like the shovelnose sturgeon, their tails are heterocercal, with the top tail fin being longer than the bottom fin, though this is more pronounced in pallid sturgeon.\n\nAs with other sturgeon, pallid sturgeon lack the scales or bones found in more \"modern\" species of fish. Instead, they have cartilaginous skeletons with five rows of thick cartilage plates that extend along their sides, undersides, and backs, as well as over most of the head. These thick cartilage plates are covered by the skin and serve as a protective armor. The bony cartilage also extends along the backside, from the dorsal fin to the tail.\n\nThe pallid sturgeon's snout and head are longer than that of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of the snout. Lacking teeth, they use their extendable mouths to suck up small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four barbels which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels is one of the best ways to distinguish the two species.\n\nPallid sturgeon have a long lifespan, living in excess of 50 and perhaps as long as 100 years. They lack bones and scales, which makes it more difficult to establish their age and determine exactly how long they live. As is true for many long-lived species, pallid sturgeon reach reproductive maturity relatively late. Males reach sexual maturity between the ages of 5 and 7 years, while females are believed to become capable of reproduction when they are at least 15 years old. One study of nine females indicated that they begin egg development between the ages of 9 and 12 years, but do not reach reproductive maturity until they are 15 years old. Reproduction does not take place every year; the average interval between spawnings is three years, although other studies suggest an interval as long as 10 years. Spawning usually takes place May to July.\n\nPrior to the construction of dams on the Missouri, pallid sturgeon migrated hundreds of miles upstream to spawn, and sought out rocky or hard surfaces to deposit hundreds of thousands of eggs. One female pallid sturgeon caught in the upper Missouri River was estimated to be carrying 170,000 eggs, representing over 11 percent of its total body weight. After fertilization, pallid sturgeon eggs hatch in 5 to 8 days, after which the larvae drift back downstream for several weeks. As the larvae develop tails, they seek out slower-moving waterways and slowly mature over a period of a dozen years. The rate of survival to maturity for pallid sturgeon larvae is extremely low, and of the hundreds of thousands of eggs spawned, only a few live to adulthood.\n\nFor several decades, no natural reproduction of pallid sturgeon was observed, since all the fish that had been captured were older specimens. In the late 1990s, young pallid sturgeon were discovered living in a restored riparian area of the lower Missouri River. This was the first documented example of wild spawned pallid sturgeon in 50 years. In 2007, two female pallid sturgeon were also reported to have spawned in the Missouri National Recreational River area located downstream from Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River.\n\nThe pallid sturgeon's historical range spanned the entire Missouri River and into the Mississippi River. Historically, the species was rare to nonexistent in the upper Mississippi, probably due to a lack of proper habitat. Currently, the species is considered imperiled throughout its entire range. As of 2008, pallid sturgeon can still be found throughout their original range, but their population numbers have severely declined from the mid-20th century. The Missouri and Mississippi rivers from Montana to Louisiana, as well as the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, continue to harbor an aging population of pallid sturgeon. Pallid sturgeon have never been very common; as early as 1905 when the species was first identified, they represented only one in five of all sturgeon in the lower Missouri River and as few as one in 500 where the Illinois River meets the Mississippi. Between 1985 and 2000, the ratio of pallid sturgeon to all sturgeon netted declined from one in about 400 to one in nearly 650. A 1996 study concluded that between 6,000 and 21,000 pallid sturgeon remained in their natural habitat at that time.\n\nSix areas were studied for wild pallid sturgeon population estimates and recovery recommendations by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) between 1990, when the species was declared endangered, and 2006. The USFWS has referred to these six areas of wild population studies as \"recovery priority management areas\" (RPMAs). In the northernmost region of the study, known as RPMA 1, located between the Marias River in Montana and the western reaches of Fort Peck Reservoir, only 45 wild (nonhatchery) individuals remain. Of these, no juveniles were observed and the population was declining. In RPMA 2, located between Fort Peck Dam, the headwaters of Lake Sakakawea, and the lower Yellowstone River up to the confluence of the Tongue River, Montana, only 136 wild specimens remain. In RPMA 3, stretching from upstream of the Niobrara River to Lewis and Clark Lake along the Missouri River, no native populations were recorded. All collected specimens appeared to be hatchery-raised. However, these specimens were apparently maturing and adjusting well to this section of the river. Recovery priority management area 4 extends from Gavins Point Dam to the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. This region also includes the Platte River. Here, at least 100 unique nonhatchery specimens were collected during the study period. Evidence also indicates some wild reproduction is going on in this region. In RPMA 5, between the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico, several hundred specimens were documented. Again, some evidence suggests natural reproduction is occurring, as demonstrated by the recovery of a few examples of immature, nonhatchery-raised individuals. The Atchafalaya River basin is designated as RPMA 6 and the findings there were similar to those in RPMAs 4 and 5, but with greater numbers of unique individuals, near 500 in total.\n\nPallid sturgeon prefer moderate to swift river currents and most captured specimens have been recovered in rivers and streams in which the current averages between . They also prefer turbid waterways and water depths between . The species is more commonly found where sandy substrates are plentiful, but also lives in predominately rocky waterways. Pallid sturgeon prefer swift river currents more often than do shovelnose sturgeon.\n\nIn a study based in Montana and North Dakota conducted on both the pallid and shovelnose sturgeon, both species were fitted with radio transmitters so researchers could track their swimming habits. Pallid sturgeon were found to prefer wider river channels, midchannel sandbars, and numerous islands, and were most commonly recorded in water depths between . The study also showed that the pallid sturgeon moved as much as per day and up to . Pallid sturgeon are believed to have preferred the muddy and generally warmer waters that existed prior to Missouri River dam construction.\n\nPallid sturgeon are generally bottom feeders, skimming the sandy reaches of the various rivers and streams in their habitat. Though little is known about the precise eating habits of the species, they are thought to be opportunistic feeders. One study which examined the contents from the stomachs of juvenile pallid sturgeon revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent. Various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others. These results support the description of the pallid sturgeon's eating habits as opportunistic. Fish is a more important dietary staple for pallid sturgeon than it is for shovelnose sturgeon. In one study comparing dietary tendencies between adult shovelnose sturgeon and immature pallid sturgeon, the pallid sturgeon was found to consume far greater numbers of small fish such as cyprinids (minnows). In another study conducted in the upper Missouri River region, an examination of the stomach contents of hatchery-reared pallid sturgeon showed that 82% of the wet weight was small fish and the balance was mosquito-like insects, mayflies, and caddis flies and small amounts of detritus and plant material.\n\nThough never believed to be common, pallid sturgeon populations rapidly declined during the late 20th century and the species was listed as endangered on September 6, 1990. The U.S. government and most of the states with pallid sturgeon populations have commenced restoration efforts to save the species from extinction. Wild reproduction of pallid sturgeon is rare to nonexistent in most areas; therefore, human intervention is needed to ensure the survival of the species. Pallid sturgeon were previously considered a prized trophy game fish species, until their numbers declined and they were placed on the endangered species list. All captured pallid sturgeon must now be released back to the wild. The species was known for being very palatable and the roe from females was used as caviar.\n\nThe route and the environmental characteristics of Missouri River in the northern Great Plains states of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and Montana have been significantly altered. The resultant changes to the Missouri River in the upper Great Plains from channelization and impoundment prevent upstream migration. The reduced water flow rates and sediment loads have brought an end to the seasonal flooding of the flood plains in the region. Since the construction of the Fort Peck Dam in Montana in 1937, and subsequent damming and channelization, the Missouri River has lost over 90% of its wetland and sandbar ecosystems. More than of the Missouri River have been altered and only that stretch of the river above Fort Peck Reservoir in Montana remains relatively unchanged. These alterations of the river have had a detrimental impact on a number of native fish species. In the 13 U.S. states where the pallid sturgeon is found, only a few other fish species are listed as endangered. Although substantial efforts are being implemented to ensure the survival of this species, the rarity of self-sustaining populations of pallid sturgeon ensures that it will remain federally protected for many decades.\n\nTwo populations of pallid sturgeon in the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers of Montana are both at risk of extinction, and current projections are that wild pallid sturgeon populations in Montana will be extinct by 2018. Though a vigorous stocking effort was implemented in 1996, until pallid sturgeon females reach reproductive maturity sometime after they are 15 years of age, recovery efforts in Montana will not be readily measurable. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has been conducting spring pulse water releases from the Tiber Dam every four to five years to try to recreate a semblance of an annual spring flood to restore and rejuvenate downstream floodplains. These pulse releases are done in an effort to restore suitable habitat for numerous fish species.\n\nIn Nebraska, a small number of pallid sturgeon have been captured along the lower reaches of the Platte River. Unlike most rivers in the Mississippi-Missouri River System, the Platte River has only a few dams and they are well upstream from its confluence with the Missouri River. The lower Platte River is shallow with numerous sand bars and small islands. Though pallid sturgeon prefer more turbulent and deeper rivers than the Platte, between 1979 and 2003, over a dozen pallid sturgeon, including some from hatcheries, have been captured from the Platte River. A number of these pallid sturgeon have been fitted with radio transmitters which track their return to the Platte River when water levels and turbidity conditions are favorable. Coinciding with the majority of the pallid sturgeon that have been captured, the period that is generally most favorable is during the spring and early summer. By midsummer, a reduction in water levels and turbidity on the Platte River encourages pallid sturgeon to return to the Missouri River.\n\nThe lower reaches of the Platte River, a more than stretch from the Elkhorn River to its confluence with the Missouri River, has suitable spawning habitat for pallid sturgeon, although no conclusive evidence has been found that spawning is occurring in this region. Along with the lower Yellowstone River, the lower Platte River was identified as one of the best of the remaining regions with the potential for the natural spawning.\n\nIn Missouri, at the Lisbon Bottoms section of the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, wild pallid sturgeon larvae were collected in 1998. These nonhatchery-raised larvae were the first recovered on the lower Missouri River in the previous 50 years. The recovery was made along a side channel of the Missouri River that had been developed to provide suitable habitat for pallid sturgeon and other fish spawning. The side channel was apparently being used by the larva pallid sturgeon for protection from the swifter currents of the Missouri River.\n\nIn 2007, the USFWS concluded that hatchery-based reproduction efforts should be continued, along with monitoring of any population changes, to determine the effectiveness of human intervention. The 2007 findings also emphasized the need to determine the most likely areas of spawning, to identify any parasite or disease that may be impacting the reproductive capabilities of pallid sturgeon, and to examine engineering possibilities that may permit recreation of suitable habitats without reducing the USFWS's ability to protect people from harmful and destructive flooding, and to maintain its ability to provide adequate water impoundment for irrigation and recreation purposes.\n\n"}

Her brief career was cut short when she died from postpartum embolism at the age of 31. She is becoming recognized as the first female painter to paint nude self-portraits. She was an important member of the artistic movement of modernism at the start of the twentieth century.\n\nBecker was born and grew up in Dresden-Friedrichstadt. She was the third of seven children in her family. Her father Carl Woldemar Becker (January 31, 1841 Odessa – November 30, 1901, Bremen), the son of a Russian university professor of French, was employed as an engineer with the German railway. Her mother, Mathilde (November 3, 1852 Lübeck – January 22, 1926 Bremen) was from an aristocratic family \"von Bültzingslöwen\", and her parents provided their children a cultured and intellectual household environment.\nIn 1888 the family moved from Dresden to Bremen. While visiting a maternal aunt in London, Becker received her first instruction in drawing at St John's Wood Art School. In 1893 she was introduced to works of the artists' circle of Worpswede; Otto Modersohn, Fritz Mackensen, Fritz Overbeck and Heinrich Vogeler presented their paintings in Bremen's Art Museum, Kunsthalle Bremen. In addition to her teacher training in Bremen in 1893–1895, Becker received private instruction in painting. In 1896 she participated in a course for painting and drawing sponsored by the Verein der Berliner Künstlerinnen (Union of Berlin Female Artists) which offered art studies to women.\n\nBecker's friend Clara Westhoff left Bremen in early 1899 to study in Paris. By December of that year, Becker followed her there, and in 1900 she studied at the Académie Colarossi in the Latin Quarter.\n\nIn April 1900 the great Centennial Exhibition was held in Paris. On this occasion Fritz Overbeck and his wife, along with Otto Modersohn, arrived in June. Modersohn's ailing wife Helen had been left in Worpswede and died during his trip to Paris. With this news Modersohn and the Overbecks rushed back to Germany.\nIn 1901 Paula married Otto Modersohn and became stepmother to Otto's two-year-old daughter, Elsbeth Modersohn, the child from his first marriage. She functioned in that capacity for two years, then relocated to Paris again in 1903. She and Modersohn lived mostly apart from that time forward until 1907, when she returned to Germany full-time, apparently in hopes of conceiving her own child.\n\nThe marriage with Modersohn remained unconsummated until their final year together. By 1906, Becker (now known as Paula Modersohn-Becker) had reversed her previous desire to avoid having children and began an affair with a well-known Parisian \"ladies' man\". However, by early 1907 she returned to her husband, became pregnant, and in November she delivered a daughter, Mathilde.\n\nAfter the pregnancy, she complained of severe leg pain, so the physician ordered bed rest. After 18 days he told her to get up and begin moving, but apparently, an embolism had formed in her leg, and with her mobility, broke off and then caused her death within hours.\n\nIn 1898, at age 22, Becker immersed herself in the artistic community of Worpswede, where artists such as Fritz Mackensen (1866–1953) and Heinrich Vogeler (1872–1942) had retreated to protest against the domination of the art academy style and life in the big city. She studied under Mackensen, painting the nearby farmers, and the northern German landscape. At this time she began close friendships with the sculptor Clara Westhoff (1875–1954) and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926).\n\nUntil the years when Becker began the practice, women painters had not widely used nude females as subjects for their work. The only notable exceptions to this dearth are works by Artemisia Gentileschi, three centuries earlier; for example, art historians assume that Gentileschi used her own body as the model for her work \"Susannah and the Elders\". Her work on the female nude is unconventional and expresses an ambivalence to both her subject matter and the method of its representation.\n\nBecker was trained in the methods of realism and naturalism, along with a recognizable simplicity of form. She was able to achieve a distinct texture to her work by scratching into the wet paint. She later abandoned those techniques to move into Fauvism. She is becoming recognized as having influenced at least one of Picasso's paintings.\n\nUntil 1907 Modersohn-Becker made another six extended trips to Paris for artistic purposes, sometimes living separately from her husband, Otto. During one of her stays in Paris she took courses at the École des Beaux-Arts. She visited contemporary exhibitions often, and was particularly intrigued with the work of Paul Cézanne. Other post impressionists were especially influential, including Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin. Fauvism influences also appear in her works such as \"Poorhouse Woman with a Glass Bottle\". The influence of French painter Jean-François Millet is noted in such pieces as her 1900 \"Peat Cutters\".\n\nDuring her last trip to Paris in 1906, she produced a series of paintings about which she felt very great excitement and satisfaction. During this period of painting, she produced her initial nude self-portraits, unprecedented for female artists, as well as portraits of her friends, including Rainer Maria Rilke and Werner Sombart. Art historians concur that this period was the strongest and most compelling time of her art production.\n\nIn 1907 Paula Modersohn-Becker returned to her husband in Worpswede, despite period correspondence that indicated her desire for independence. She wrote in detail about her love for her husband but also of her need to delay motherhood in her pursuit of artistic freedom. She continued to express ambivalence regarding motherhood as she was concerned about her ability to paint while raising a child; her diary entries indicate that she had planned on achieving a painting career by age thirty, then having children. So, when her daughter Mathilde (Tillie) Modersohn was born on November 2, 1907, Paula and Otto were joyous. The joy became tragedy nineteen days later, when Paula suddenly died. She had complained of pain in her legs after the delivery, and was advised to remain in bed. When the physician returned on 21 November, he advised her to rise. She walked a few steps, then sat down, called for the infant to be placed in her arms, complained of leg pain, and died, saying only \"What a pity.\" She was buried in the Worpswede Cemetery where her grave is preserved. \n\nModersohn-Becker employed the same technique throughout her short career as a painter. She worked in tempera and oil with a limited range of pigments such as zinc white, cadmium yellow, viridian, and synthetic ultramarine.\n\nBy 1899 Clara Westhoff had made a bust of her friend Becker, saying that it was a symbol of their friendship and shared passion for art.\n\nIn 1908 Rainer Maria Rilke wrote the renowned poem \"Requiem for a Friend\" in memory of Paula Modersohn-Becker.\n\nThe art and architecture of the Paula Modersohn-Becker Museum was denounced by local Nazis in 1935 but Ludwig Roselius ignored this until Hitler denounced the Böttcherstrase in September 1936 and Roselius contemplated suicide but Barbara Götte intervened on his behalf with Hitler.\n\nMathilde Modersohn (1907–1998) founded the Paula Modersohn-Becker Foundation (Paula Modersohn-Becker-Stiftung) in 1978.\n\nIn 1988 a stamp with the portrait of Paula Modersohn-Becker was issued in the series Women in German history by the German post-office authority Deutsche Bundespost.\n\nPaula Modersohn-Becker was not widely known at the time of her untimely death, and would have dropped into obscurity but for her voluminous writing. She maintained a diary, and corresponded regularly with friends in her artistic circle. Her letters were collected and widely published (in German) during the 1920s, and it was largely through them that her legacy was maintained. In the 1970s, US art historian Diane Radycki first translated them into English (they have also been translated by others since then). Two-thirds of the correspondence occurred from age 16 to the early years of her marriage, and are full of youthful optimism and energy.\n\nOn the 8th of February 2018 Becker's birthday was celebrated in a Google Doodle.\n\nModersohn-Becker's house in Bremen, where she spent much of her life, opened in October 2007 as a private art museum and gallery. Her family moved from Dresden to Bremen in 1888 and lived in this house. Becker lived here until 1899, when she was 23 years old, and set up her first studio in this house. There was an active artist community in Bremen and via Becker's mother's friendships in the art world, Paula grew to be part of the community. Apart from her teacher training in Bremen in 1893–1895, Paula took private instruction in painting. It was not well known that the young Becker had lived here for ten years; in 2003 Heinz and Betty Thies bought the then run-down house, and had it restored in time for the 100th anniversary of the artist's death. At that time (November 2007) it was turned into a public museum.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1058599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1058599", "title": "Piaget's theory of cognitive development", "text": "Piaget's theory of cognitive development\n\nPiaget's theory of cognitive development is a comprehensive theory about the nature and development of human intelligence. It was first created by the Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget (1896–1980). The theory deals with the nature of knowledge itself and how humans gradually come to acquire, construct, and use it. Piaget's theory is mainly known as a developmental stage theory.\n\nTo Piaget, cognitive development was a progressive reorganization of mental processes resulting from biological maturation and environmental experience. He believed that children construct an understanding of the world around them, experience discrepancies between what they already know and what they discover in their environment, then adjust their ideas accordingly. Moreover, Piaget claimed that cognitive development is at the center of the human organism, and language is contingent on knowledge and understanding acquired through cognitive development. Piaget's earlier work received the greatest attention.\n\nChild-centered classrooms and \"open education\" are direct applications of Piaget's views. Despite its huge success, Piaget's theory has some limitations that Piaget recognized himself: for example, the theory supports sharp stages rather than continuous development (horizontal and vertical décalage).\n\nPiaget noted that reality is a dynamic system of continuous change. Reality is defined in reference to the two conditions that define dynamic systems. Specifically, he argued that reality involves transformations and states. Transformations refer to all manners of changes that a thing or person can undergo. States refer to the conditions or the appearances in which things or persons can be found between transformations. For example, there might be changes in shape or form (for instance, liquids are reshaped as they are transferred from one vessel to another, and similarly humans change in their characteristics as they grow older), in size (a toddler does not walk and run without falling, but after 7 yrs of age, the child's sensory motor anatomy is well developed and now acquires skill faster), or in placement or location in space and time (e.g., various objects or persons might be found at one place at one time and at a different place at another time). Thus, Piaget argued, if human intelligence is to be adaptive, it must have functions to represent both the transformational and the static aspects of reality. He proposed that operative intelligence is responsible for the representation and manipulation of the dynamic or transformational aspects of reality, and that figurative intelligence is responsible for the representation of the static aspects of reality.\n\nOperative intelligence is the active aspect of intelligence. It involves all actions, overt or covert, undertaken in order to follow, recover, or anticipate the transformations of the objects or persons of interest. Figurative intelligence is the more or less static aspect of intelligence, involving all means of representation used to retain in mind the states (i.e., successive forms, shapes, or locations) that intervene between transformations. That is, it involves perception, imitation, mental imagery, drawing, and language. Therefore, the figurative aspects of intelligence derive their meaning from the operative aspects of intelligence, because states cannot exist independently of the transformations that interconnect them. Piaget stated that the figurative or the representational aspects of intelligence are subservient to its operative and dynamic aspects, and therefore, that understanding essentially derives from the operative aspect of intelligence.\n\nAt any time, operative intelligence frames how the world is understood and it changes if understanding is not successful. Piaget stated that this process of understanding and change involves two basic functions: assimilation and accommodation.\n\nThrough his study of the field of education, Piaget focused on two processes, which he named assimilation and accommodation. To Piaget, assimilation meant integrating external elements into structures of lives or environments, or those we could have through experience. Assimilation is how humans perceive and adapt to new information. It is the process of fitting new information into pre-existing cognitive schemas. Assimilation in which new experiences are reinterpreted to fit into, or assimilate with, old ideas. It occurs when humans are faced with new or unfamiliar information and refer to previously learned information in order to make sense of it. In contrast, accommodation is the process of taking new information in one's environment and altering pre-existing schemas in order to fit in the new information. This happens when the existing schema (knowledge) does not work, and needs to be changed to deal with a new object or situation. Accommodation is imperative because it is how people will continue to interpret new concepts, schemas, frameworks, and more. Piaget believed that the human brain has been programmed through evolution to bring equilibrium, which is what he believed ultimately influences structures by the internal and external processes through assimilation and accommodation.\n\nPiaget's understanding was that assimilation and accommodation cannot exist without the other. They are two sides of a coin. To assimilate an object into an existing mental schema, one first needs to take into account or accommodate to the particularities of this object to a certain extent. For instance, to recognize (assimilate) an apple as an apple, one must first focus (accommodate) on the contour of this object. To do this, one needs to roughly recognize the size of the object. Development increases the balance, or equilibration, between these two functions. When in balance with each other, assimilation and accommodation generate mental schemas of the operative intelligence. When one function dominates over the other, they generate representations which belong to figurative intelligence.\n\nIn his theory of Cognitive development, Jean Piaget proposed that humans progress through four developmental stages:\nthe sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational and formal operational period. The first of these, the sensorimotor stage \"extends from birth to the acquisition of language.\" In this stage, infants progressively construct knowledge and understanding of the world by coordinating experiences (such as vision and hearing) with physical interactions with objects (such as grasping, sucking, and stepping). Infants gain knowledge of the world from the physical actions they perform within it. They progress from reflexive, instinctual action at birth to the beginning of symbolic thought toward the end of the stage.\n\nChildren learn that they are separate from the environment. They can think about aspects of the environment, even though these may be outside the reach of the child's senses. In this stage, according to Piaget, the development of object permanence is one of the most important accomplishments. Object permanence is a child's understanding that an object continues to exist even though they cannot see or hear it. Peek-a-boo is a game in which children who have yet to fully develop object permanence respond to sudden hiding and revealing of a face. By the end of the sensorimotor period, children develop a permanent sense of self and object and will quickly lose interest in Peek-a-boo.\n\nPiaget divided the sensorimotor stage into six sub-stages\".\n\nBy observing sequences of play, Piaget was able to demonstrate that, towards the end of the second year, a qualitatively new kind of psychological functioning occurs, known as the pre-operational stage, the second of Piaget's four developmental stages. It starts when the child begins to learn to speak at age two and lasts up until the age of seven. During the pre-operational stage of cognitive development, Piaget noted that children do not yet understand concrete logic and cannot mentally manipulate information. Children's increase in playing and pretending takes place in this stage. However, the child still has trouble seeing things from different points of view. The children's play is mainly categorized by symbolic play and manipulating symbols. Such play is demonstrated by the idea of checkers being snacks, pieces of paper being plates, and a box being a table. Their observations of symbols exemplifies the idea of play with the absence of the actual objects involved.\n\nThe pre-operational stage is sparse and logically inadequate in regard to mental operations. The child is able to form stable concepts as well as magical beliefs. The child, however, is still not able to perform operations, which are tasks that the child can do mentally, rather than physically. Thinking in this stage is still egocentric, meaning the child has difficulty seeing the viewpoint of others. The Pre-operational Stage is split into two substages: the symbolic function substage, and the intuitive thought substage. The symbolic function substage is when children are able to understand, represent, remember, and picture objects in their mind without having the object in front of them. The intuitive thought substage is when children tend to propose the questions of \"why?\" and \"how come?\" This stage is when children want to understand everything.\n\nAt about two to four years of age, children cannot yet manipulate and transform information in a logical way. However, they now can think in images and symbols. Other examples of mental abilities are language and pretend play. Symbolic play is when children develop imaginary friends or role-play with friends. Children's play becomes more social and they assign roles to each other. Some examples of symbolic play include playing house, or having a tea party. The type of symbolic play in which children engage is connected with their level of creativity and ability to connect with others. Additionally, the quality of their symbolic play can have consequences on their later development. For example, young children whose symbolic play is of a violent nature tend to exhibit less prosocial behavior and are more likely to display antisocial tendencies in later years.\n\nIn this stage, there are still limitations, such as egocentrism and precausal thinking.\nEgocentrism occurs when a child is unable to distinguish between their own perspective and that of another person. Children tend to stick to their own viewpoint, rather than consider the view of others. Indeed, they are not even aware that such a concept as \"different viewpoints\" exists. Egocentrism can be seen in an experiment performed by Piaget and Swiss developmental psychologist Bärbel Inhelder, known as the three mountain problem. In this experiment, three views of a mountain are shown to the child, who is asked what a traveling doll would see at the various angles. The child will consistently describe what they can see from the position from which they are seated, regardless of the angle from which they are asked to take the doll's perspective. Egocentrism would also cause a child to believe, \"I like \"Sesame Street\", so Daddy must like \"Sesame Street\", too.\"\n\nSimilar to preoperational children's egocentric thinking is their structuring of a cause and effect relationships. Piaget coined the term \"precausal thinking\" to describe the way in which preoperational children use their own existing ideas or views, like in egocentrism, to explain cause-and-effect relationships. Three main concepts of causality as displayed by children in the preoperational stage include: animism, artificialism and transductive reasoning.\n\nAnimism is the belief that inanimate objects are capable of actions and have lifelike qualities. An example could be a child believing that the sidewalk was mad and made them fall down, or that the stars twinkle in the sky because they are happy. Artificialism refers to the belief that environmental characteristics can be attributed to human actions or interventions. For example, a child might say that it is windy outside because someone is blowing very hard, or the clouds are white because someone painted them that color. Finally, precausal thinking is categorized by transductive reasoning. Transductive reasoning is when a child fails to understand the true relationships between cause and effect. Unlike deductive or inductive reasoning (general to specific, or specific to general), transductive reasoning refers to when a child reasons from specific to specific, drawing a relationship between two separate events that are otherwise unrelated. For example, if a child hears the dog bark and then a balloon popped, the child would conclude that because the dog barked, the balloon popped.\n\nAt between about the ages of 4 and 7, children tend to become very curious and ask many questions, beginning the use of primitive reasoning. There is an emergence in the interest of reasoning and wanting to know why things are the way they are. Piaget called it the \"intuitive substage\" because children realize they have a vast amount of knowledge, but they are unaware of how they acquired it. Centration, conservation, irreversibility, class inclusion, and transitive inference are all characteristics of preoperative thought.\nCentration is the act of focusing all attention on one characteristic or dimension of a situation, whilst disregarding all others. Conservation is the awareness that altering a substance's appearance does not change its basic properties. Children at this stage are unaware of conservation and exhibit centration. Both centration and conservation can be more easily understood once familiarized with Piaget's most famous experimental task.\n\nIn this task, a child is presented with two identical beakers containing the same amount of liquid. The child usually notes that the beakers do contain the same amount of liquid. When one of the beakers is poured into a taller and thinner container, children who are younger than seven or eight years old typically say that the two beakers no longer contain the same amount of liquid, and that the taller container holds the larger quantity (centration), without taking into consideration the fact that both beakers were previously noted to contain the same amount of liquid. Due to superficial changes, the child was unable to comprehend that the properties of the substances continued to remain the same (conservation).\n\nIrreversibility is a concept developed in this stage which is closely related to the ideas of centration and conservation. Irreversibility refers to when children are unable to mentally reverse a sequence of events. In the same beaker situation, the child does not realize that, if the sequence of events was reversed and the water from the tall beaker was poured back into its original beaker, then the same amount of water would exist. Another example of children's reliance on visual representations is their misunderstanding of \"less than\" or \"more than\". When two rows containing equal amounts of blocks are placed in front of a child, one row spread farther apart than the other, the child will think that the row spread farther contains more blocks.\n\nClass inclusion refers to a kind of conceptual thinking that children in the preoperational stage cannot yet grasp. Children's inability to focus on two aspects of a situation at once inhibits them from understanding the principle that one category or class can contain several different subcategories or classes. For example, a four-year-old girl may be shown a picture of eight dogs and three cats. The girl knows what cats and dogs are, and she is aware that they are both animals. However, when asked, \"Are there more dogs or animals?\" she is likely to answer \"more dogs\". This is due to her difficulty focusing on the two subclasses and the larger class all at the same time. She may have been able to view the dogs as dogs \"or\" animals, but struggled when trying to classify them as both, simultaneously. Similar to this is concept relating to intuitive thought, known as \"transitive inference\".\n\nTransitive inference is using previous knowledge to determine the missing piece, using basic logic. Children in the preoperational stage lack this logic. An example of transitive inference would be when a child is presented with the information \"A\" is greater than \"B\" and \"B\" is greater than \"C\". This child may have difficulty here understanding that \"A\" is also greater than \"C\".\n\nThe concrete operational stage is the third stage of Piaget's theory of cognitive development. This stage, which follows the preoperational stage, occurs between the ages of 7 and 11 (preadolescence) years, and is characterized by the appropriate use of logic. During this stage, a child's thought processes become more mature and \"adult like\". They start solving problems in a more logical fashion. Abstract, hypothetical thinking is not yet developed in the child, and children can only solve problems that apply to concrete events or objects. At this stage, the children undergo a transition where the child learns rules such as conservation. Piaget determined that children are able to incorporate Inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning involves drawing inferences from observations in order to make a generalization. In contrast, children struggle with deductive reasoning, which involves using a generalized principle in order to try to predict the outcome of an event. Children in this stage commonly experience difficulties with figuring out logic in their heads. For example, a child will understand that \"A is more than B\" and \"B is more than C\". However, when asked \"is A more than C?\", the child might not be able to logically figure the question out in his or her head.\n\nTwo other important processes in the concrete operational stage are logic and the elimination of egocentrism.\n\nEgocentrism is the inability to consider or understand a perspective other than one's own. It is the phase where the thought and morality of the child is completely self focused. During this stage, the child acquires the ability to view things from another individual's perspective, even if they think that perspective is incorrect. For instance, show a child a comic in which Jane puts a doll under a box, leaves the room, and then Melissa moves the doll to a drawer, and Jane comes back. A child in the concrete operations stage will say that Jane will still think it's under the box even though the child knows it is in the drawer. (See also False-belief task.)\n\nChildren in this stage can, however, only solve problems that apply to actual (concrete) objects or events, and not abstract concepts or hypothetical tasks. Understanding and knowing how to use full common sense has not yet been completely adapted.\n\nPiaget determined that children in the concrete operational stage were able to incorporate inductive logic. On the other hand, children at this age have difficulty using deductive logic, which involves using a general principle to predict the outcome of a specific event. This includes mental reversibility. An example of this is being able to reverse the order of relationships between mental categories. For example, a child might be able to recognize that his or her dog is a Labrador, that a Labrador is a dog, and that a dog is an animal, and draw conclusions from the information available, as well as apply all these processes to hypothetical situations.\n\nThe abstract quality of the adolescent's thought at the formal operational level is evident in the adolescent's verbal problem solving ability. The logical quality of the adolescent's thought is when children are more likely to solve problems in a trial-and-error fashion. Adolescents begin to think more as a scientist thinks, devising plans to solve problems and systematically test opinions. They use hypothetical-deductive reasoning, which means that they develop hypotheses or best guesses, and systematically deduce, or conclude, which is the best path to follow in solving the problem. During this stage the adolescent is able to understand love, logical proofs and values. During this stage the young person begins to entertain possibilities for the future and is fascinated with what they can be.\n\nAdolescents also are changing cognitively by the way that they think about social matters. Adolescent egocentrism governs the way that adolescents think about social matters, and is the heightened self-consciousness in them as they are, which is reflected in their sense of personal uniqueness and invincibility. Adolescent egocentrism can be dissected into two types of social thinking, imaginary audience that involves attention-getting behavior, and personal fable, which involves an adolescent's sense of personal uniqueness and invincibility. These two types of social thinking begin to affect a child's egocentrism in the concrete stage. However, it carries over to the formal operational stage when they are then faced with abstract thought and fully logical thinking.\n\nPiagetian tests are well known and practiced to test for concrete operations. The most prevalent tests are those for conservation. There are some important aspects that the experimenter must take into account when performing experiments with these children.\n\nOne example of an experiment for testing conservation is the water level task.\nAn experimenter will have two glasses that are the same size, fill them to the same level with liquid, which the child will acknowledge is the same. Then, the experimenter will pour the liquid from one of the small glasses into a tall, thin glass. The experimenter will then ask the child if the taller glass has more liquid, less liquid, or the same amount of liquid. The child will then give his answer. The experimenter will ask the child why he gave his answer, or why he thinks that is.\n\nThe final stage is known as the formal operational stage (adolescence and into adulthood, roughly ages 11 to approximately 15–20): Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts. This form of thought includes \"assumptions that have no necessary relation to reality.\" At this point, the person is capable of hypothetical and deductive reasoning. During this time, people develop the ability to think about abstract concepts.\n\nPiaget stated that \"hypothetico-deductive reasoning\" becomes important during the formal operational stage. This type of thinking involves hypothetical \"what-if\" situations that are not always rooted in reality, i.e. counterfactual thinking. It is often required in science and mathematics.\n\nWhile children in primary school years mostly used inductive reasoning, drawing general conclusions from personal experiences and specific facts, adolescents become capable of deductive reasoning, in which they draw specific conclusions from abstract concepts using logic. This capability results from their capacity to think hypothetically.\n\n\"However, research has shown that not all persons in all cultures reach formal operations, and most people do not use formal operations in all aspects of their lives\".\n\nPiaget and his colleagues conducted several experiments to assess formal operational thought.\n\nIn one of the experiments, Piaget evaluated the cognitive capabilities of children of different ages through the use of a scale and varying weights. The task was to balance the scale by hooking weights on the ends of the scale. To successfully complete the task, the children must use formal operational thought to realize that the distance of the weights from the center and the heaviness of the weights both affected the balance. A heavier weight has to be placed closer to the center of the scale, and a lighter weight has to be placed farther from the center, so that the two weights balance each other. While 3- to 5- year olds could not at all comprehend the concept of balancing, children by the age of 7 could balance the scale by placing the same weights on both ends, but they failed to realize the importance of the location. By age 10, children could think about location but failed to use logic and instead used trial-and-error. Finally, by age 13 and 14, in early adolescence, some children more clearly understood the relationship between weight and distance and could successfully implement their hypothesis.\n\nPiaget sees children's conception of causation as a march from \"primitive\" conceptions of cause to those of a more scientific, rigorous, and mechanical nature. These primitive concepts are characterized as supernatural, with a decidedly non-natural or non-mechanical tone. Piaget has as his most basic assumption that babies are phenomenists. That is, their knowledge \"consists of assimilating things to schemas\" from their own action such that they appear, from the child's point of view, \"to have qualities which, in fact, stem from the organism\". Consequently, these \"subjective conceptions,\" so prevalent during Piaget's first stage of development, are dashed upon discovering deeper empirical truths.\n\nPiaget gives the example of a child believing that the moon and stars follow him on a night walk. Upon learning that such is the case for his friends, he must separate his self from the object, resulting in a theory that the moon is immobile, or moves independently of other agents.\n\nThe second stage, from around three to eight years of age, is characterized by a mix of this type of magical, animistic, or \"non-natural\" conceptions of causation and mechanical or \"naturalistic\" causation. This conjunction of natural and non-natural causal explanations supposedly stems from experience itself, though Piaget does not make much of an attempt to describe the nature of the differences in conception. In his interviews with children, he asked questions specifically about natural phenomena, such as: \"What makes clouds move?\", \"What makes the stars move?\", \"Why do rivers flow?\" The nature of all the answers given, Piaget says, are such that these objects must perform their actions to \"fulfill their obligations towards men\". He calls this \"moral explanation\".\n\nParents can use Piaget's theory when deciding how to determine what to buy in order to support their child's growth. Teachers can also use Piaget's theory, for instance, when discussing whether the syllabus subjects are suitable for the level of students or not. For example, recent studies have shown that children in the same grade and of the same age perform differentially on tasks measuring basic addition and subtraction fluency. While children in the preoperational and concrete operational levels of cognitive development perform combined arithmetic operations (such as addition and subtraction) with similar accuracy, children in the concrete operational level of cognitive development have been able to perform both addition problems and subtraction problems with overall greater fluency.\n\nThe stage of cognitive growth of a person differ from another. Cognitive development or thinking is an active process from the beginning to the end of life. Intellectual advancement happens because people at every age and developmental period looks for cognitive equilibrium. To achieve this balance, the easiest way is to understand the new experiences through the lens of the preexisting ideas. Infants learn that new objects can be grabbed in the same way of familiar objects, and adults explain the day's headlines as evidence for their existing worldview.\n\nHowever, the application of standardized Piagetian theory and procedures in different societies established widely varying results that lead some to speculate not only that some cultures produce more cognitive development than others but that without specific kinds of cultural experience, but also formal schooling, development might cease at certain level, such as concrete operational level. A procedure was done following methods developed in Geneva (i.e. water level task). Participants were presented with two beakers of equal circumference and height, filled with equal amounts of water. The water from one beaker was transferred into another with taller and smaller circumference. The children and young adults from non-literate societies of a given age were more likely to think that the taller, thinner beaker had more water in it. On the other hand, an experiment on the effects of modifying testing procedures to match local cultural produced a different pattern of results. In the revised procedures, the participants explained in their own language and indicated that while the water was now \"more\", the quantity was the same. Piaget's water level task has also been applied to the elderly by Formann and results showed an age-associated non-linear decline of performance.\n\nIn 1967, Piaget considered the possibility of RNA molecules as likely embodiments of his still-abstract schemas (which he promoted as units of action)—though he did not come to any firm conclusion. At that time, due to work such as that of Swedish biochemist Holger Hydén, RNA concentrations had, indeed, been shown to correlate with learning, so the idea was quite plausible.\n\nHowever, by the time of Piaget's death in 1980, this notion had lost favor. One main problem was over the protein which, it was assumed, such RNA would necessarily produce, and that did not fit in with observation. It was determined that only about 3% of RNA does code for protein. Hence, most of the remaining 97% (the \"ncRNA\") could theoretically be available to serve as Piagetian schemas (or other regulatory roles in the 2000s under investigation). The issue has not yet been resolved experimentally, but its theoretical aspects were reviewed in 2008 — then developed further from the viewpoints of biophysics and epistemology. Meanwhile, this RNA-based approach also unexpectedly offered explanations for other several biological issues unresolved, thus providing some measure of corroboration.\n\nPiaget designed a number of tasks to verify hypotheses arising from his theory. The tasks were not intended to measure individual differences, and they have no equivalent in psychometric intelligence tests. Notwithstanding the different research traditions in which psychometric tests and Piagetian tasks were developed, the correlations between the two types of measures have been found to be consistently positive and generally moderate in magnitude. A common general factor underlies them. It has been shown that it is possible to construct a battery consisting of Piagetian tasks that is as good a measure of general intelligence as standard IQ tests.\n\nPiagetian accounts of development have been challenged on several grounds. First, as Piaget himself noted, development does not always progress in the smooth manner his theory seems to predict. \"Décalage\", or progressive forms of cognitive developmental progression in a specific domain, suggest that the stage model is, at best, a useful approximation. Furthermore, studies have found that children may be able to learn concepts and capability of complex reasoning that supposedly represented in more advanced stages with relative ease (Lourenço & Machado, 1996, p. 145). More broadly, Piaget's theory is \"domain general,\" predicting that cognitive maturation occurs concurrently across different domains of knowledge (such as mathematics, logic, and understanding of physics or language). Piaget did not take into account variability in a child's performance notably how a child can differ in sophistication across several domains.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive developmentalists were influenced by \"neo-nativist\" and evolutionary psychology ideas. These ideas de-emphasized domain general theories and emphasized domain specificity or modularity of mind. Modularity implies that different cognitive faculties may be largely independent of one another, and thus develop according to quite different timetables, which are \"influenced by real world experiences\". In this vein, some cognitive developmentalists argued that, rather than being domain general learners, children come equipped with domain specific theories, sometimes referred to as \"core knowledge,\" which allows them to break into learning within that domain. For example, even young infants appear to be sensitive to some predictable regularities in the movement and interactions of objects (for example, an object cannot pass through another object), or in human behavior (for example, a hand repeatedly reaching for an object has that object, not just a particular path of motion), as it becomes the building block of which more elaborate knowledge is constructed.\n\nPiaget's theory has been said to undervalue the influence that culture has on cognitive development. Piaget demonstrates that a child goes through several stages of cognitive development and come to conclusions on their own but in reality, a child's sociocultural environment plays an important part in their cognitive development. Social interaction teaches the child about the world and helps them develop through the cognitive stages, which Piaget neglected to consider.\n\nMore recent work has strongly challenged some of the basic presumptions of the \"core knowledge\" school, and revised ideas of domain generality—but from a newer dynamic systems approach, not from a revised Piagetian perspective. Dynamic systems approaches harken to modern neuroscientific research that was not available to Piaget when he was constructing his theory. One important finding is that domain-specific knowledge is constructed as children develop and integrate knowledge. This enables the domain to improve the accuracy of the knowledge as well as organization of memories. However, this suggests more of a \"smooth integration\" of learning and development than either Piaget, or his neo-nativist critics, had envisioned. Additionally, some psychologists, such as Lev Vygotsky and Jerome Bruner, thought differently from Piaget, suggesting that language was more important for cognition development than Piaget implied.\n\nIn recent years, several theorists attempted to address concerns with Piaget's theory by developing new theories and models that can accommodate evidence which violates Piagetian predictions and postulates.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3020976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3020976", "title": "Platoon system", "text": "Platoon system\n\nThe platoon system or two-platoon system in baseball or football is the method directing the substitution of players.\n\nIn baseball, a platoon is a method of sharing playing time, where two players are selected to play a single defensive position. Usually, one platoon player is right-handed and the other is left-handed. Typically the right-handed half of the platoon is played on days when the opposing starting pitcher is left-handed and the left-handed player is played otherwise. The theory behind this is that generally players hit better against their opposite-handed counterparts, and that in some cases the difference is extreme enough to warrant complementing the player with one of opposite handedness.\nRight-handed batters have an advantage against left-handed pitchers, as left-handed batters benefit from facing right-handed pitchers. This is because a right-handed pitcher's curveball breaks to the left, from his own point of view, which causes it to cross the plate with its lateral movement away from a right-handed batter but towards a left-handed batter (and vice versa for a left-handed pitcher), and because batters generally find it easier to hit a ball that is over the plate. Furthermore, since most pitchers are right-handed, left-handed batters generally have less experience with left-handed pitchers. A left-handed pitcher may also be brought in to face a switch-hitter who generally bats left-handed, forcing the batter to shift to his less-effective right-handed stance or to take the disadvantages of batting left-handed against a left-handed pitcher.\n\nPlatooning can be viewed negatively. Players prefer to play every day, and managers, including Walter Alston, feared that sharing playing time could decrease confidence. Mookie Wilson of the New York Mets requested a trade in 1988 after serving in a platoon for three seasons with Lenny Dykstra.\n\nThe advantage to alternating hitters based on handedness was known from the early days of baseball. Bob Ferguson, in 1871, became baseball's first switch hitter, allowing him to bat left-handed against right-handed pitchers, and right-handed against left-handed pitchers. The first recorded platoon took place in 1887, when the Indianapolis Hoosiers briefly paired the right-handed Gid Gardner and left-handed Tom Brown in center field. In 1906, the Detroit Tigers alternated Boss Schmidt, Jack Warner, and Freddie Payne at catcher for the entire season. As manager of the Boston Braves, George Stallings employed platoons during the 1914 season, which helped the \"Miracle\" Braves win the 1914 World Series. No Braves outfielder reached 400 at-bats during the 1914 season. In 1934 and 1935, Detroit Tigers' manager Mickey Cochrane routinely platooned Gee Walker, a right-handed batter, to spell center fielder Goose Goslin and right fielder Jo-Jo White, who were both left-handed batters. Cochrane, a left-handed batter, also platooned himself behind the plate with Ray Hayworth, a right-handed batter. Also in the 1930s, Bill Terry of the New York Giants platooned center fielders Hank Leiber and Jimmy Ripple. The approach was seldom used in the 1930s, but Casey Stengel, managing the Braves, platooned third basemen Debs Garms and Joe Stripp in 1938. Stengel himself had been platooned as a player by managers John McGraw and Wilbert Robinson. Garms won the National League's batting title in 1940 with the Pittsburgh Pirates as a part-time player under Frankie Frisch.\n\nTerms for this strategy included \"double-batting shift, \"switch-around players\", and \"reversible outfield\". Tris Speaker referred to his strategy as the \"triple shift\", because he employed it at three positions. The term \"platoon\" was coined in the late 1940s. Stengel, now managing the New York Yankees, became a well known proponent of the platoon system, and won five consecutive World Series championships from 1949 through 1953 using the strategy. Stengel platooned Bobby Brown, Billy Johnson, and Gil McDougald at third base, Joe Collins and Moose Skowron at first base, and Hank Bauer and Gene Woodling in left field. Harold Rosenthal, writing for the \"New York Herald\", referred to Stengel's strategy as a \"platoon\", after the American football concept, and it came to be known as \"two-platooning\".\n\nFollowing Stengel's success, other teams began implementing their own platoons. In the late 1970s through early 1980s, Baltimore Orioles manager Earl Weaver successfully employed a platoon in left field, using John Lowenstein, Benny Ayala, and Gary Roenicke, using whichever player was performing the best at the time. Weaver also considered other factors, including the opposing pitcher's velocity, and his batters' ability in hitting a fastball. The Orioles continued to platoon at catcher and all three outfield positions in 1983 under Joe Altobelli, as the Orioles won the 1983 World Series, leading other teams to pursue the strategy.\nPlatooning decreased in frequency from the late 1980s through the 1990s, as teams expanded their bullpens to nullify platoon advantages for hitters. However, the use of platoons has increased in recent years. As teams increase their analysis of data, they attempt to put batters and pitchers in situations where they are more likely to succeed. Generally, small market teams, which cannot afford to sign the league's best players to market-value contracts, are most likely to employ platoons. Under manager Bob Melvin, the Athletics have employed many platoons, with Josh Reddick calling Melvin the \"king of platoons\". Joe Maddon began to employ platoons as manager of the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nThe 2013 World Series champion Boston Red Sox platooned Jonny Gomes and Daniel Nava in left field. After the 2013 season, left-handed relief pitchers Boone Logan and Javier López, both considered left-handed specialists because of their ability to limit the effectiveness of left-handed batters, signed multimillion-dollar contracts as free agents.\n\nPrior to 1941, virtually all football players saw action on \"both sides of the ball,\" playing in both offensive and defensive roles in a one-platoon system. From 1941 to 1952, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) allowed unlimited substitution. This change was originally made because of the difficulty in fielding highly skilled players during the years of the Second World War, in which many able-bodied college-age men volunteered for or were drafted into military service.\n\nThe first known use of the so-called \"two-platoon\" system was by Michigan head coach Fritz Crisler in 1945 against an Army team under head coach \"Colonel\" Earl \"Red\" Blaik. Michigan lost the game 28–7, but Crisler's use of eight players who played only on offense, eight who played only on defense, and three that played both, impressed Blaik enough for him to adopt it for his own team. Blaik, a former soldier himself, coined the \"platoon\" terminology in reference to the type of military unit. Between 1946 and 1950, Blaik's two-platoon teams twice finished the season ranked second in the Associated Press polls and never finished lower than 11th.\n\nIn 1954, the NCAA emplaced a set of new rules requiring the use of the one-platoon system, primarily due to financial reasons. The system allowed only one player to be substituted between plays, which effectively put an end to the use of separate specialized units. Tennessee head coach \"General\" Robert Neyland praised the change as the end of \"chickenshit football\".\n\nIn 1958, LSU coach Paul Dietzel came up with a unique three-platoon system. It consisted of three teams of 11 different players, and was designed to keep his players from being fatigued in an era when most players started on both offense and defense. Instead of replacing individual players during the game, Dietzel would bring in an entirely new set of players between plays and series. The three teams were called the White Team (the first-string offense and defense), the Gold (Go) Team (the second-string offense), and the Chinese Bandits (the second-string defense). The system worked, as the Tigers went undefeated and won the national championship. The Chinese Bandits, the second-string defensive unit, which consisted of less-talented but ferocious players, became hugely popular with LSU fans and remains one of the most legendary pieces of LSU football history.\n\nAfter the 1964 season, twelve years since the mandate requiring one-platoon, the NCAA repealed the rules enforcing its use and allowed an unlimited amount of player substitutions. This allowed, starting with the 1965 season, teams to form separate offensive and defensive units as well as \"special teams\" which would be employed in kicking situations. The reinstatement of the two-platoon system allowed players to become more specialized by focusing on a limited number of plays and skills related to their specific position. With players now fresher, coaches could now build their teams for speed and agility rather than brute strength and endurance; Don Coryell took advantage of the quarterbacks and wide receivers that were overlooked in the days of one-platoon ball to create one of the first predominantly passing offenses in top-level football. This, in turn, prompted defenses to respond in kind with wider-open defenses that emphasized linebackers and defensive backs, which in turn led to the rise of modern defenses such as the 4–3 defense and 3–4 defense and led to earlier defenses with more defensive linemen becoming obsolete. By the early 1970s, however, some university administrators, coaches and others were calling for a return to the days of one-platoon football.\n\nWhen a football team uses two (or more) quarterbacks to run their offense, rather than the traditional one in football, it is known as \"platooning quarterbacks.\" This tactic becomes less common the higher the level of football (high school teams are more likely to do it than National Football League teams for example). Quarterbacks may be switched in and out of the game every play, every drive, every quarter, or depending on certain situations. If quarterbacks are switched game to game that is not platooning, that is a \"quarterback controversy\" or a simple benching.\n\nUsing two different quarterbacks allows an offense to use players with different skill sets. One common reason teams platoon quarterbacks is because one player is a good passer and the other a good runner (see for example Stanley Jackson and Joe Germaine of the 1997 Ohio State Buckeyes). Thus defenses have to prepare for two types of quarterback, not just one. It also allows offenses to run a greater variety of plays.\n\n"}

Arrested in 2000, he died in a Russian penal colony under mysterious circumstances.\n\nRaduyev was born in 1967 into the Gordaloy teip (clan) in Novogroznensky near Gudermes in eastern Chechnya. During the early 1980s Raduyev was active in the communist youth league Komsomol of which he eventually became a leader for the whole Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. After attending a high school in Gudermes, Raduyev served 1985-1987 in the Soviet Army as a construction engineer in a Strategic Rocket Forces unit stationed in the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, where he became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After demobilization, he studied economics and worked in the Soviet construction industry.\n\nAfter Chechnya declared independence, he was appointed the prefect of Gudermes in June 1992 by his father-in-law, Dzhokhar Dudayev, who was the president of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. He also married the daughter of Dudayev's sister.\n\nDuring the First Chechen War Raduyev became a field commander for the separatist Chechen forces. He fought in the battle of Grozny and was wounded in March 1995 during an attempt to capture him by the Russian special forces. In October 1995, he became one of the most important of the Chechen field commanders, leading the 6th Brigade based in the strategically important Gudermessky District and responsible for the Gudermessky, part of the capital Grozny and the town of Argun. On December 14, 1995, Raduyev, along with Sultan Geliskhanov, led a raid on the city of Gudermes.\n\nOn January 9, 1996, Raduyev, allegedly copying Shamil Basayev's 1995 Budyonnovsk attack in Chechnya, led a large-scale Kizlyar hostage taking raid into the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, where his men took at least 2,000 civilians hostage. The raid, which made Raduyev world-famous, escalated into an all-out battle that ended with the complete destruction of the border village of Pervomayskoye, and led to other Chechen leaders criticizing the attack. In March 1996, Raduyev was shot in the head and incorrectly reported dead; Russian special forces claimed to have \"killed\" him in revenge for the Kizlyar attack, while the other sources said he was shot in a Chechen feud. On March 7, 63 out of 101 deputies of the Parliament of Estonia sent condolences to Dudayev expressing \"deep sympathy with the Chechen people\" on \"the loss of commander Raduyev,\" sparking a row with the Russian Duma. In fact, Raduyev just disappeared as he went for medical treatment abroad.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Raduyev returned to the republic and refused the orders of Chechnya's acting president, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, to stop carrying out terrorist operations (he claimed ordering bombings of trolleybuses in Moscow and train stations in Armavir and Pyatigorsk), in light of the ceasefire and talks that would lead up to the Khasav-Yurt Accord. Raduyev even accused Yandarbiyev of treason for agreeing to a ceasefire and threatened to attack him. Raduyev, his face deformed by injury and now hidden behind bushy red beard and black sunglasses, was the only field commander to announce openly that the \"war without rules\" with Russia would continue despite the signing of the peace agreement.\n\nIn 1997, the newly elected Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov stripped Raduyev of the rank of brigadier general to private. However, further action was blocked by a public opposition from Raduyev-led war veterans, including a prolonged rally in Grozny. This rally ended in a shootout, resulting in the deaths of both the commander of Raduyev's militia, Vakha Dzhafarov, and of the Chechen security forces chief Lechi Khultygov. Meanwhile, Raduyev kept claiming responsibility for every explosion in Russia, including even official gas leaks. He claimed that Dudayev, who had died in 1996, was still alive, and issuing orders to him from \"a secret NATO base in Turkey\" with the goal of the \"liberation\" of the entire North Caucasus. Raduyev's eccentric behavior, however, was not widely popular in Chechnya. Many openly doubted his sanity: in an interview in 1997, Maskhadov described Raduyev as \"mentally ill\"; even Basayev, who has been Raduyev's ally in the opposition against Maskhadov, reportedly called him \"crazy.\" In October 1997, Raduyev was again severely injured by a car bomb which killed three other people. Previously, he had survived at least two other assassination attempts, in April and July 1997.\n\nIn May 1998, the Chechnya's Islamic court sentenced Raduyev in absence to four years in prison for allegedly attempting to overthrow Maskhadov, but made no attempt to arrest him. In September 1998, Raduyev announced a \"temporary moratorium\" on acts of terrorism. As a sign of his good gesture towards Russia, Raduyev claimed that it was he who had freed nine kidnapped Russian servicemen from their captors. He also became conflicted with the Islamist circles and called for a ban of \"Wahhabism\" in Chechnya. In January 1999, he backed the republic's parliament in its conflict with the Sharia Court. His private army-style militia, some 1,000-strong and called \"General Dudayev's Army\", was reportedly involved in several train robberies.\n\nIn early 1999, Raduyev vanished from public again while undergoing a major plastic surgery operation in Germany, in effect acquiring a new face. The alleged implants of titanium earned him the nickname of \"Titanic\" in Russia, while in Chechnya he became popularly known as \"Michael Jackson\", a reference to his plastic surgery. Still seriously ill and recovering from surgery, Raduyev vowed \"reprisals\" against Russia for the March 1999 sentencing of two Chechen women. In September 1999, at the start of the Second Chechen War, Raduyev organized a rally in Grozny attended by 12,000 people where he urged residents to stay home and prepare to defend the city. His militia was reported to be virtually destroyed by a series of serious setbacks during the early fighting in late 1999, and he stopped talking about planning and organizing new attacks afterward.\n\nRaduyev was captured in March 2000 by the Russian special operations FSB unit \"Vympel\" in his home in Novogroznensky; During the second war Salman was very ill and had to go for treatment abroad, so he shaved his beard and moved to a house near the borders in preparation for the exit. One of his men, however, informed the Russian forces about his location, he was arrested without incident. Russian president Vladimir Putin said that Raduyev had confessed to trying to assassinate Eduard Shevardnadze, the president of Georgia.\n\nRaduyev was tried on 18 different charges, including terrorism, banditry, hostage-taking, organization of murders and organization of illegal armed formations. He pleaded not guilty, maintained he was only following orders, claimed to suffer from no mental disorders whatsoever and said he hoped to be released from prison in some 10–12 years. Dozens of witnesses were called to testify, but many of the alleged victims of his actions refused to participate. In December 2001, he was sentenced to life in prison. His appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation in April 2002.\n\nIn December 2002, Raduyev died in the White Swan penal colony in Solikamsk from internal bleeding. The Russian authorities said he was not beaten to death, but died due to \"serious and protracted diseases\". Raduyev's body was not returned to his family because of a newly introduced Russian law barring the release of bodies of people convicted (or accused) of terrorism.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the death of Raduyev are not clear, and according to his family and other separatists he was murdered in prison after he refused to talk about the accusations against Akhmed Zakayev, then arrested in Denmark. \"Kommersant\" daily said that \"the real reason for Raduyev's death will probably never be known,\" while \"Vremya Novostei\" suggested that, after being forced to give all the information requested from him, he was therefore \"no longer needed\" by the Russian authorities and killed. Amnesty International has called for a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death but the request was ignored and his body not exhumed.\n\nSalman Raduyev was survived by his wife and two sons – Johar and Zelimhan, living abroad.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "207754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207754", "title": "Somatic cell", "text": "Somatic cell\n\nA somatic cell (from the Greek σῶμα \"sôma\", meaning \"body\") or vegetal cell is any biological cell forming the body of an organism; that is, in a multicellular organism, any cell other than a gamete, germ cell, gametocyte or undifferentiated stem cell.\n\nIn contrast, gametes are cells that fuse during sexual reproduction, germ cells are cells that give rise to gametes, and stem cells are cells that can divide through mitosis and differentiate into diverse specialized cell types. For example, in mammals, somatic cells make up all the internal organs, skin, bones, blood and connective tissue, while mammalian germ cells give rise to spermatozoa and ova which fuse during fertilization to produce a cell called a zygote, which divides and differentiates into the cells of an embryo. There are approximately 220 types of somatic cells in the human body.\n\nTheoretically, these cells are not germ cells (the source of gametes); they never transmit to their descendants the mutations they have undergone. However, in sponges, non-differentiated somatic cells form the germ line and, in Cnidaria, differentiated somatic cells are the source of the germline.\n\nThe word \"somatic\" is derived from the Greek word \"sōma\", meaning \"body\".\n\nAs multicellularity evolved many times, sterile somatic cells did too. The evolution of an immortal germline producing specialized somatic cells involved the emergence of mortality, and can be viewed in its simplest version in volvocine algae. Those species with a separation between sterile somatic cells and a germ line are called Weismannists. However, Weismannist development is relatively rare (e.g., vertebrates, arthropods, \"Volvox\"), as a great number of species have the capacity for somatic embryogenesis (e.g., land plants, most algae, many invertebrates).\n\nLike all cells, somatic cells contain DNA arranged in chromosomes. If a somatic cell contains chromosomes arranged in pairs, it is called diploid and the organism is called a diploid organism. (The gametes of diploid organisms contain only single unpaired chromosomes and are called haploid.) Each pair of chromosomes comprises one chromosome inherited from the father and one inherited from the mother. For example, in humans, somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes organized into 23 pairs. By contrast, gametes of diploid organisms contain only half as many chromosomes. In humans, this is 23 unpaired chromosomes. When two gametes (i.e. a spermatozoon and an ovum) meet during conception, they fuse together, creating a zygote. Due to the fusion of the two gametes, a human zygote contains 46 chromosomes (i.e. 23 pairs).\n\nHowever, a large number of species have the chromosomes in their somatic cells arranged in fours (\"tetraploid\") or even sixes (\"hexaploid\"). Thus, they can have diploid or even triploid germline cells. An example of this is the modern cultivated species of wheat, \"Triticum aestivum L.\", a hexaploid species whose somatic cells contain six copies of every chromatid.\n\nThe frequency of spontaneous mutations is significantly lower in advanced male germ cells than in somatic cell types from the same individual. Female germ cells also show a mutation frequency that is lower than that in corresponding somatic cells and similar to that in male germ cells. These findings appear to reflect employment of more effective mechanisms to limit the initial occurrence of spontaneous mutations in germ cells than in somatic cells. Such mechanisms likely include elevated levels of DNA repair enzymes that ameliorate most potentially mutagenic DNA damages.\n\nIn recent years, the technique of cloning whole organisms has been developed in mammals, allowing almost identical genetic clones of an animal to be produced. One method of doing this is called \"somatic cell nuclear transfer\" and involves removing the nucleus from a somatic cell, usually a skin cell. This nucleus contains all of the genetic information needed to produce the organism it was removed from. This nucleus is then injected into an ovum of the same species which has had its own genetic material removed. The ovum now no longer needs to be fertilized, because it contains the correct amount of genetic material (a diploid number of chromosomes). In theory, the ovum can be implanted into the uterus of a same-species animal and allowed to develop. The resulting animal will be a nearly genetically identical clone to the animal from which the nucleus was taken. The only difference is caused by any mitochondrial DNA that is retained in the ovum, which is different from the cell that donated the nucleus. In practice, this technique has so far been problematic, although there have been a few high-profile successes, such as Dolly the Sheep and, more recently, Snuppy, the first cloned dog.\nSomatic cells have also been collected in the practice of cryoconservation of animal genetic resources as a means of conserving animal genetic material, including to clone livestock.\n\nDevelopment of biotechnology has allowed for the genetic manipulation of somatic cells, whether for the modelling of chronic disease or for the prevention of malaise conditions.\n\nGenetic engineering of somatic cells has resulted in some controversies, although the International Summit on Human Gene Editing has released a statement in support of genetic modification of somatic cells, as the modifications thereof are not passed on to offspring.\n\n"}
{"id": "2426653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2426653", "title": "Spaceflight osteopenia", "text": "Spaceflight osteopenia\n\nSpaceflight osteopenia refers to the characteristic bone loss that occurs during spaceflight. Astronauts lose an average of more than 1% bone mass per month spent in space. There is concern that during long duration flights, excessive bone loss and the associated increase in serum calcium ion levels will interfere with execution of mission tasks and result in irreversible skeletal damage.\n\nBone loss has been observed during spaceflight since at least as early as Gemini in the 1960s. Although most early measurements of the amount of bone loss were not reliable, they did show bone loss in Gemini, Soyuz 9, Apollo, Skylab, Salyut 7, Mir, and the International Space Station. William E. Thornton, an astronaut and physician, was one of the biggest proponents of exercise as a way of preventing bone loss.\n\nBone remodels in response to stress in order to maintain constant strain energy per bone mass throughout. To do this, it grows more dense in areas experiencing high stress, while resorbing density in areas experiencing low stress. On Mars, where gravity is about one-third that of earth, the gravitational forces acting on astronauts' bodies would be much lower, causing bones to decrease in mass and density.\n\nAverage bone loss of 1-2% was recorded in astronauts on Mir each month. This is in comparison to 1–1.5% bone loss in the elderly \"per year\", and 2–3% in postmenopausal women.\n\nSince Gemini, exercise has been tried as a way of preventing bone loss, but it has not been shown to be successful. This may be in part due to lack of adequately designed studies (no controlled study had been done as of 2005, either in space or using bedrest as an attempt to simulate conditions which lead to bone loss). It is not known whether a different exercise regimen (perhaps including larger loads than past ones) would be effective.\n\nIncreasing dietary calcium and vitamin D is a standard countermeasure for osteoporosis. Clay is reportedly used by NASA for retaining calcium.\n\nA variety of drug remedies currently used or proposed for osteoporosis may work for spaceflight, including hormone therapy (estrogen and/or progestin), selective estrogen receptor modulators, bisphosphonates, teriparatide, and others. Whether they can provide the same benefits for spaceflight as they do for osteoporosis is not yet known.\n\n"}
{"id": "199556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199556", "title": "Taxon", "text": "Taxon\n\nIn biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \"taxonomy\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping.\n\nAlthough preceded by Linnaeus's system in \"Systema Naturae\" (10th edition, 1758) and unpublished work by Bernard and Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, the notion of a unit-based \"natural system\" of biological classification was first made widely available in 1805 through the publication, as the introduction to the third edition of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's \"Flore françoise\", of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle's \"Principes élémentaires de botanique\", an exposition of a system for the \"natural classification\" of plants. Since then, systematists have striven to construct an accurate classification encompassing the diversity of life; today, a \"good\" or \"useful\" taxon is commonly taken to be one that reflects evolutionary relationships. \n\nMany modern systematists, such as advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature, use cladistic methods that require taxa to be monophyletic (all descendants of some ancestor). Their basic unit, therefore, is the clade rather than the taxon. Similarly, among those contemporary taxonomists working with the traditional Linnean (binomial) nomenclature, few propose taxa they know to be paraphyletic. An example of a well-established taxon that is not also a clade is the class Reptilia, the reptiles; birds are descendants of reptiles but are not included in the Reptilia.\n\nThe term \"taxon\" was first used in 1926 by for animal groups, as a backformation from the word Taxonomy; the word \"Taxonomy\" had been coined a century before from the Greek components \"τάξις\" (taxis, meaning arrangement) and \"-νομία\" (-nomia meaning method). For plants, it was proposed by Herman Johannes Lam in 1948, and it was adopted at the VII International Botanical Congress, held in 1950.\n\nThe Glossary of the \"International Code of Zoological Nomenclature\" (1999) defines a \n\nA taxon can be assigned a taxonomic rank, usually (but not necessarily) when it is given a formal name.\n\n\"Phylum\" applies formally to any biological domain, but traditionally it was always used for animals, whereas \"Division\" was traditionally often used for plants, fungi, etc.\n\nA prefix is used to indicate a ranking of lesser importance. The prefix \"super-\" indicates a rank above, the prefix \"sub-\" indicates a rank below. In zoology the prefix \"infra-\" indicates a rank below \"sub-\". For instance, among the additional ranks of class are superclass, subclass and infraclass.\n\nRank is relative, and restricted to a particular systematic schema. For example, liverworts have been grouped, in various systems of classification, as a family, order, class, or division (phylum). The use of a narrow set of ranks is challenged by users of cladistics; for example, the mere 10 ranks traditionally used between animal families (governed by the ICZN) and animal phyla (usually the highest relevant rank in taxonomic work) often cannot adequately represent the evolutionary history as more about a lineage's phylogeny becomes known. In addition, the class rank is quite often not an evolutionary but a phenetic or paraphyletic group and as opposed to those ranks governed by the ICZN (family-level, genus-level and species-level taxa), can usually not be made monophyletic by exchanging the taxa contained therein. This has given rise to phylogenetic taxonomy and the ongoing development of the \"PhyloCode\", which has been proposed as a new alternative to replace Linnean classification and govern the application of names to clades. Many cladists do not see any need to depart from traditional nomenclature as governed by the ICZN, ICN, etc.\n\n"}

{"id": "967149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=967149", "title": "The Trojan Women", "text": "The Trojan Women\n\nThe Trojan Women (, \"Trōiades\"), also known by its Latin title Troades, is a tragedy by the Greek playwright Euripides. Produced in 415 BC during the Peloponnesian War, it is often considered a commentary on the capture of the Aegean island of Melos and the subsequent slaughter and subjugation of its populace by the Athenians earlier that year \"(see History of Milos)\". 415 BC was also the year of the scandalous desecration of the \"hermai\" and the Athenians' second expedition to Sicily, events which may also have influenced the author.\n\n\"The Trojan Women\" was the third tragedy of a trilogy dealing with the Trojan War. The first tragedy, \"Alexandros\", was about the recognition of the Trojan prince Paris who had been abandoned in infancy by his parents and rediscovered in adulthood. The second tragedy, \"Palamedes\", dealt with Greek mistreatment of their fellow Greek Palamedes. This trilogy was presented at the Dionysia along with the comedic satyr play \"Sisyphos\". The plots of this trilogy were not connected in the way that Aeschylus' \"Oresteia\" was connected. Euripides did not favor such connected trilogies.\n\nEuripides won second prize at the City Dionysia for his effort, losing to the obscure tragedian Xenocles.\n\nThe four Trojan women of the play are the same that appear in the final book of the \"Iliad\" lamenting over the corpse of Hector. Taking place near the same time is \"Hecuba\", another play by Euripides.\n\nEuripides's play follows the fates of the women of Troy after their city has been sacked, their husbands killed, and as their remaining families are about to be taken away as slaves. However, it begins first with the gods Athena and Poseidon discussing ways to punish the Greek armies because they condoned that Ajax the Lesser raped Cassandra, the eldest daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, after dragging her from a statue of Athena. What follows shows how much the Trojan women have suffered as their grief is compounded when the Greeks dole out additional deaths and divide their shares of women.\n\nThe Greek herald Talthybius arrives to tell the dethroned queen Hecuba what will befall her and her children. Hecuba will be taken away with the Greek general Odysseus, and Cassandra is destined to become the conquering general Agamemnon's concubine.\nCassandra, who can see the future, is morbidly delighted by this news: she sees that when they arrive in Argos, her new master's embittered wife Clytemnestra will kill both her and her new master. However, Cassandra is also cursed so that her visions of the future are never believed, and she is carried off.\n\nThe widowed princess Andromache arrives and Hecuba learns from her that her youngest daughter, Polyxena, has been killed as a sacrifice at the tomb of the Greek warrior Achilles.\nAndromache's lot is to be the concubine of Achilles' son Neoptolemus, and more horrible news for the royal family is yet to come: Talthybius reluctantly informs her that her baby son, Astyanax, has been condemned to die. The Greek leaders are afraid that the boy will grow up to avenge his father Hector, and rather than take this chance, they plan to throw him off from the battlements of Troy to his death.\n\nHelen, though not one of the Trojan women, is supposed to suffer greatly as well: Menelaus arrives to take her back to Greece with him where a death sentence awaits her. Helen begs and tries to seduce her husband into sparing her life. Menelaus remains resolved to kill her, but the audience watching the play knows that he will let her live and take her back. At the end of the play it is revealed that she is still alive; moreover, the audience knows from Telemachus' visit to Sparta in Homer's \"Odyssey\" that Menelaus continued to live with Helen as his wife after the Trojan War.\nIn the end, Talthybius returns, carrying with him the body of little Astyanax on Hector's shield. Andromache's wish had been to bury her child herself, performing the proper rituals according to Trojan ways, but her ship had already departed. Talthybius gives the corpse to Hecuba, who prepares the body of her grandson for burial before they are finally taken off with Odysseus.\n\nThroughout the play, many of the Trojan women lament the loss of the land that reared them. Hecuba in particular lets it be known that Troy had been her home for her entire life, only to see herself as an old grandmother watching the burning of Troy, the death of her husband, her children, and her grandchildren before she will be taken as a slave to Odysseus.\n\nIn 1974, Ellen Stewart, founder of La MaMa Experimental Theater Club in New York, presented \"The Trojan Women\" as the last Fragment of a Trilogy (including Medea and Electra). With staging by Romanian-born theater director Andrei Serban and music by American composer Elizabeth Swados, this production of The Trojan Women went on to tour more than thirty countries over the course of forty years. Since 2014, The Trojan Women Project has been sharing this production with diverse communities that now include Guatemala, Cambodia and Kosovo. A Festival of work from all participants is scheduled for December, 2019.\n\nThe French public intellectual, Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a version of \"The Trojan Women\" that mostly is faithful to the original Greek text, yet includes veiled references to European imperialism in Asia, and emphases of existentialist themes. The Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin also wrote his own version of the play, adding more disturbing scenes and scatological details.\n\nA 1905 stage version, translated by Gilbert Murray, starred Gertrude Kingston as Helen at the Royal Court Theatre in London.\n\nThe Mexican film \"Las Troyanas\" (1963) directed by Sergio Véjar, adapted by writer Miguel Angel Garibay and Véjar, is faithful to the Greek text and setting; Ofelia Guilmain portrays Hecuba, the black&white photography is by Agustín Jimenez.\n\nCypriot-Greek director Mihalis Kakogiannis used Euripides' play (in the famous Edith Hamilton translation) as the basis for his 1971 film \"The Trojan Women\". The movie starred American actress Katharine Hepburn as Hecuba, British actors Vanessa Redgrave and Brian Blessed as Andromache and Talthybius, French-Canadian actress Geneviève Bujold as Cassandra, Greek actress Irene Papas as Helen, and Patrick Magee, an actor born in Northern Ireland, as Menelaus.\n\nDavid Stuttard’s 2001 adaptation, \"Trojan Women\", written in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, has toured widely within the UK and been staged internationally. In an attempt to reposition \"The Trojan Women\" as the third play of a trilogy, Stuttard then reconstructed Euripides’ lost \"Alexandros\" and \"Palamedes\" (in 2005 and 2006 respectively), to form a 'Trojan Trilogy', which was performed in readings at the British Museum and Tristan Bates Theatre (2007), and Europe House, Smith Square (2012), London. He has also written a version of the satyr play \"Sisyphus\" (2008), which rounded off Euripides’ original trilogy.\n\nFemi Osofisan's 2004 play \"Women of Owu\" sets the story in 1821, after the conquest of the Owu kingdom by a coalition of other West African states. Although it is set in 19th century Africa, Osofisan has said that the play was also inspired by the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. led coalition.\nAnother movie based on the play came out in 2004, directed by Brad Mays. The production was actually a documentary film of the stage production Mays directed for the ARK Theatre Company in 2003. In anticipation of his soon-to-come multimedia production of \"\", Mays utilized a marginal multimedia approach to the play, opening the piece with a faux CNN report intended to echo the then-current war in Iraq.\n\nCharles L.

The victim has to drink all the water (or other liquids such as bile or urine) poured into the funnel to avoid drowning. The stomach fills until near bursting and is sometimes beaten until the victim vomits and the torture begins again.\n\nWhile this use of water as a form of torture is documented back to at least the 15th century, the first use of the phrase water cure in this sense is indirectly dated to around 1898, by U.S. soldiers in the Spanish–American War, after the phrase had been introduced to America in the mid-19th century in the therapeutic sense, which was in widespread use. Indeed, while the torture sense of the phrase \"water cure\" was by 1900–1902 established in the U.S. Army, with a conscious sense of irony, this sense was not in widespread use. \"Webster's\" 1913 dictionary cited only the therapeutic sense.\n\nThe use of the water cure by the Dutch in the East-Indies is documented by the English merchants of the East India Company after the Amboyna massacre in February 1623 (stilo veteri). The procedure is described in great detail by the survivors of the incident.\n\nThe manner of his torture was as follows: First they hoisted him up by the hands with a cord on a large door, where they made him fast upon two staples of iron, fixed on both sides, at the top of the door posts, having his hands one from the other as wide as they could stretch. Being thus made fast, his feet hung some two foot from the ground; which also they stretched asunder as far as they would stretch, and so made them fast beneath unto the door trees on each side. Then they bound a cloth about his neck and face so close, that little or no water could go by. That done, they poured the water softly upon his head until the cloth was full, up to the mouth and nostrils, and somewhat higher; so that he could not draw breath, but he must with all suck in the water: which being still continued to be poured in softly, forced all his inward parts, come out of his nose, ears, eyes, and often as it were stifling and choking him, at length took away his breath, and brought him to a swoon or fainting. Then they took him quickly down, and made him vomit up the water. Being a little recovered, they trussed him up again, and poured water as before, taking him down as soon as he seemed to be stifled. In this manner they handled him three or four several times with water, until his body was swollen twice or thrice as big as before, his cheeks like great bladders, and his eyes staring and strutting out beyond his forehead.\n\nWater torture was used extensively and legally by the courts of France from the Middle Ages to the 17th and 18th centuries. It was known as being put to \"the question\", with the ordinary question involving the forcing of one gallon (eight pints or approximately 3.6 litres) of water into the stomach and the extraordinary question involving the forcing of two gallons (sixteen pints or approximately 7.3 litres).\n\nThe French poet and criminal François Villon was subjected to this torture in 1461. Jean Calas suffered this torture before being broken on the wheel in 1762. The true case of the Marquise of Brinvilliers was reported in fiction by Arthur Conan Doyle in \"The Leather Funnel\", by Alexandre Dumas, père, in \"The Marquise de Brinvilliers\" and by Émile Gaboriau in \"Intrigues of a Poisoner\".\n\nA form of water cure known as the Swedish drink was used by various international troops against the German population during the Thirty Years' War.\n\nWater cure was among the forms of torture used by the Spanish Inquisition. The Inquisition at Málaga subjected the Scottish traveller William Lithgow to this torture, among other methods, in 1620. He described his ordeal in \"Rare Adventures and Painful Peregrinations\" (1632) :\n\nThe first and second [measures of water] I gladly received, such was the scorching drought of my tormenting pain, and likewise I had drunk none for three days before. But afterward, at the third charge, perceiving these measures of water to be inflicted upon me as tortures, O strangling tortures! I closed my lips, gainstanding that eager crudelity. Whereat the alcalde enraging, set my teeth asunder with a pair of iron cadges, detaining them there, at every several turn, both mainly and manually; whereupon my hunger-clunged belly waxing great, grew drum-like imbolstered: for it being a suffocating pain, in regard of my head hanging downward, and the water reingorging itself in my throat with a struggling force; it strangled and swallowed up my breath from yowling and groaning.\n\nBefore pouring the water, torturers often inserted an iron prong (known as the \"bostezo\") into a victim's mouth to keep it open, as well as a strip of linen (known as the \"toca\") on which the victim would choke and suffocate while swallowing the water.\n\nThe water cure was brought to the Philippines during Spanish colonial rule, and passed on to Americans by Filipinos in 1899.\n\nThe water cure was among the forms of torture used by American soldiers on Filipinos during the Philippine–American War. President Theodore Roosevelt privately assured a friend that the water cure was \"an old Filipino method of mild torture. Nobody was seriously damaged whereas the Filipinos had inflicted incredible tortures on our people.\" The president went further, stating, \"Nevertheless, torture is not a thing that we can tolerate.\" However, a report at the time noted its lethality; \"a soldier who was with General Funston had stated that he helped to administer the water cure to one hundred and sixty natives, all but twenty-six of whom died\". See the Lodge Committee for detailed testimony of the use of the water cure.\n\nU.S. Army Major Edwin Glenn was suspended from command for one month and fined $50 for using the water cure in an incident which occurred on November 27, 1900. The Army judge advocate said the charges constituted \"resort to torture with a view to extort a confession\" and recommended disapproval because \"the United States cannot afford to sanction the addition of torture\".\n\nLieutenant Grover Flint during the Philippine–American War:\nA man is thrown down on his back and three or four men sit or stand on his arms and legs and hold him down; and either a gun barrel or a rifle barrel or a carbine barrel or a stick as big as a belaying pin,that is, with an inch circumference,is simply thrust into his jaws and his jaws are thrust back, and, if possible, a wooden log or stone is put under his head or neck, so he can be held more firmly. In the case of very old men I have seen their teeth fall out,I mean when it was done a little roughly. He is simply held down and then water is poured onto his face down his throat and nose from a jar; and that is kept up until the man gives some sign or becomes unconscious. And, when he becomes unconscious, he is simply rolled aside and he is allowed to come to. In almost every case the men have been a little roughly handled. They were rolled aside rudely, so that water was expelled. A man suffers tremendously, there is no doubt about it. His sufferings must be that of a man who is drowning, but cannot drown.\n\nIn his book \"The Forging of the American Empire\" Sidney Lens recounted:\nA reporter for the New York Evening Post (April 8, 1902) gave some harrowing details. The native, he said, is thrown on the ground, his arms and legs pinned down, and head partially raised \"so as to make pouring in the water an easier matter\". If the prisoner tries to keep his mouth closed, his nose is pinched to cut off the air and force him to open his mouth, or a bamboo stick is put in the opening. In this way water is steadily poured in, one, two, three, four, five gallons, until the body becomes \"an object frightful to contemplate\". In this condition, of course, speech is impossible, so the water is squeezed out of the victim, sometimes naturally, and sometimesas a young soldier with a smile told the correspondent\"we jump on them to get it out quick.\" One or two such treatments and the prisoner either talks or dies.\n\nThe use of \"third degree interrogation\" techniques in order to compel confession, ranging from \"psychological duress such as prolonged confinement to extreme violence and torture\", was widespread in early American policing as late as the 1930s. Author Daniel G. Lassiter classified the water cure as \"orchestrated physical abuse\", and described the police technique as a \"modern day variation of the method of water torture that was popular during the Middle Ages.\" The technique employed by the police involved either holding the head in water until almost drowning, or laying on the back and forcing water into the mouth or nostrils. Such techniques were classified as \"'covert' third degree torture\" since they left no signs of physical abuse, and became popular after 1910 when the direct application of physical violence in order to force a confession became a media issue and some courts began to deny obviously compelled confessions. The publication of this information in 1931 as part of the Wickersham Commission's \"Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement\" led to a decline in the use of third degree police interrogation techniques in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nDuring World War II, water cure was among the forms of torture used by Japanese troops (especially the Kempeitai) in occupied territory. A report from the postwar International Military Tribunal for the Far East summarized it as follows:\nThe so-called \"water treatment\" was commonly used. The victim was bound or otherwise secured in a prone position; and water was forced through his mouth and nostrils into his lungs and stomach until he lost consciousness. Pressure was then applied, sometimes by jumping upon his abdomen to force the water out. The usual practice was to revive the victim and successively repeat the process.\n\nChase J. Nielson, who was captured in the Doolittle raid, testified at the trial of his captors, \"I was given several types of torture … I was given what they call the water cure\" and it felt \"more or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death.\"\n\nThe water cure has had a long history of use in during Philippines's colonial history, having been used during the Spanish, American, and Japanese occupations. After Philippine Independence in 1945, the most notable instances of its use by the Philippine government was by the dictatorship of former President Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nThe water cure was one of the torture methods most used frequently by the Marcos Regime in the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, whose torturers referred to the practice as NAWASA sessions - a reference to the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority which supplied water to the Metro Manila area at the time. The practice was widely documented by organizations such as the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines, the World Council of Churches, the International Commission of Jurists, among others. Notable survivors of the torture include Loretta Ann Rosales, who eventually became the Chair of the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights, and Maria Elena Ang, who was a 23-year-old Journalism student of the University of the Philippines at the time of her torture.\n\n\n"}
