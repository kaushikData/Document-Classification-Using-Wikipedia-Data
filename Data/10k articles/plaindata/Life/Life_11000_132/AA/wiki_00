His son, Abu'l-Fath Ali ibn Muhammad, also called Ibn al-'Amid, succeeded him in his office.\n\nAbu 'l-Fadl was the son of al-'Amid, a native of Qom from a low-class family, who served the various rulers of Tabaristan, but was later taken captive by the Samanids. Abu 'l-Fadl is first mentioned in 940, when the Buyid ruler Rukn al-Dawla, who greatly favored him, appointed him as his vizier. In 948, Abu 'l-Fadl served as the tutor of Rukn al-Dawla's son 'Adud al-Dawla. In ca. 955, a son of Abu 'l-Fadl's father's former overlord, Muhammad ibn Makan, marched towards the domains of Rukn al-Dawla, conquering the important cities Isfahan and Ray. During their invasion, Abu 'l-Fadl tried to repel them, but was defeated. However, in a second battle, with the aid of Adud al-Dawla, he managed to rout them, reconquer lost territory, and capture their leader Muhammad. Another Dailamite military officer named Ruzbahan also shortly rebelled against Mu'izz al-Dawla, while his brother Bullaka rebelled against Adud al-Dawla at Shiraz. Abu 'l-Fadl, however, managed to suppress the rebellion. In the 960s, the prominent official Ibn Miskawayh served Abu 'l-Fadl as his chief librarian in an important library in Ray.\n\nIn 966, Abu 'l-Fadl was wounded during an invasion by \"ghazis\" from Khorasan, who plundered much of Jibal, and marched towards the great library of Ray, which was, however, saved by Ibn Miskawayh. Rukn al-Dawla shortly managed to repel them. The next year, under the orders of Rukn al-Dawla, Abu 'l-Fadl conquered Azerbaijan, and restored the Sallarid Ibrahim I ibn Marzuban I as the ruler of the region, but shortly urged Rukn al-Dawla to depose Ibrahim and impose direct Buyid control on the region. Rukn al-Dawla, however, declined his advice. In 970, Abu 'l-Fadl was sent on an expedition to the Kurdish ruler Hasanwayh, but died before he managed to deal with the latter, and was shortly succeeded as vizier by his son Abu'l-Fath, who shortly managed to deal with Hasanwayh.\n\nAbu 'l-Fadl enjoyed an excellent reputation as a scholar and became the centre of a literary circle. Amongst his outstanding contributions to science is his book entitled \"Building Cities\" in which he describes building methods and construction planning. The book exists as an original manuscript in one of the Arabic and Islamic libraries in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n"}

{"id": "34212305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34212305", "title": "Argumentation ethics", "text": "Argumentation ethics\n\nArgumentation ethics is a proposed proof of the libertarian principle of self-ownership developed in 1988 by Hans-Hermann Hoppe, a Professor Emeritus with the University of Nevada, Las Vegas College of Business and Ludwig von Mises Institute Senior Fellow. Responses have mainly come from Hoppe's colleagues at the Mises Institute, among whom the argument's reception has been mixed.\n\nArgumentation ethics aims to prove that arguing against self-ownership is logically incoherent. Hoppe states that if argumentation praxeologically presupposes the norm that both the speaker and the listener are allowed to exercise exclusive control over their respective physical bodies in order to settle a disagreement or resolve a conflict over scarce resources, then it follows that propositions propounded during such argumentation cannot contradict this norm without falling into a (dialectical) performative contradiction between one's actions and words. Thus Hoppe concludes that despite aggressive behaviour being possible, it can not be argumentatively justified.\n\nHoppe states that his theory is an a priori, value-free praxeological argument for libertarian ethics. Argumentation ethics asserts the non-aggression principle is a presupposition of every argument and so cannot be logically denied during an argument. Argumentation ethics draws on ideas from Jürgen Habermas's and Karl-Otto Apel's discourse ethics, from Misesian praxeology and from the political philosophy of Murray Rothbard.\n\nHoppe first notes that when two parties are in conflict with one another they can, eventually, choose to resolve the conflict by one of two means. Engaging in violence, or engaging in honest argumentation. In the event that they choose argumentation, Hoppe asserts that the parties must have implicitly rejected violence as a way to resolve their conflict. That is, both participants agree that each one has to exercise exclusive control over their body parts in order to produce and perceive meaningful sentences. He therefore concludes that non-violence is one of the underlying norms (Grundnorm) of meaningful argumentation that is accepted by both participants.\n\nHoppe states that since because both parties act to propound propositions in the course of such argumentation, and because argumentation must presuppose certain norms (that he specifies, non-violence among them), then the content of the propositions cannot negate the presupposed propositions of argumentation. To do so is a performative contradiction between one's actions and one's words.\n\nArgumentation ethics aims to show the non-aggression principle (in a certain formulation) follows from the presuppositions of argumentation, and so it cannot be denied.\n\nOther than dismissing propositions calling for violence as means to resolve conflict, Hoppe also argues that only universal norms are consistent with such meaningful argumentation, as, he claims, arbitrary categorical distinctions have no intersubjective justification, which also must be a presupposition of such argumentation. Hoppe then also argues that since argumentation requires the active use of one's body, all universal norms for resolving conflicts over the human body aside from self-ownership are inconsistent with argumentation, as they would not allow one to independently move. Hoppe then argues that since the resolution of conflicts over external resources must also be objectively justifiable, only the physical establishment of an objective link by original appropriation (i.e., homesteading) is a norm compatible with such a requirement. From these Hoppe concludes that only the non-aggression principle of self-ownership and Lockean homesteading can be justified in an argument without contradiction.\n\nBearing reference to the legal doctrine of estoppel, Stephan Kinsella's \"Dialogical Estoppel\" theory extends argumentation ethics by considering an argument between a victim and aggressor. Kinsella argues that an aggressor cannot consistently object to being proportionally punished for his act of aggression, by the victim or by the victim's representatives, because by committing aggression he commits himself to the proposition that the use of force is legitimate, and therefore, his withholding consent based on a normative right not to be physically harmed contradicts his aggressive legitimation of force, i.e. he is \"estopped\" from withholding consent.\n\nVarious responses to Hoppe's argument came from Mises Institute scholars. Some of them accepted his argument, among them attorney Kinsella and economists Walter Block and Murray Rothbard, who called it \"a dazzling breakthrough for political philosophy in general and for libertarianism in particular,\" adding \"he has managed to transcend the famous is/ought, fact/value dichotomy that has plagued philosophy since the days of the Scholastics...\"\n\nMises Institute economists Bob Murphy and Gene Callahan rejected Hoppe's argument. The late Austrian Economist David Osterfeld, an adjunct scholar at the Mises Institute, also rejected Hoppe's argument in an essay to which Hoppe subsequently responded. Walter Block has since defended the argument and Marian Eabrasu rebuts a wide range of criticisms.\n\nLudwig Von Mises Institute Senior Fellow and Auburn University philosopher Roderick Long reconstructed the argument in deductively valid form, specifying four premises on whose truth the argument's soundness depends. Long goes on to argue that each premise is either uncertain, doubtful, or clearly false. He summarizes his views by stating:\n\nA political theorist has concluded in a doctoral dissertation on the political philosophy of several Austrian economists that Hoppe has not provided any non-circular reasons why we \"have to regard moral values as something that \"must\" be regarded as being established through (consensual) argument instead of 'mere' subjective preferences for situations turning out in certain ways\". In other words, the theory relies on \"the existence [of] certain intuitions, the acceptance of which cannot itself be the result of 'value-free' reasoning.\"\n\n\n"}

Trade in these body parts is performed in a manner akin to raw materials, though many brokers say they charge fees as opposed to selling body parts.\n\nWhereas body snatching was a common way of acquiring bodies for research up until the 20th century, modern body brokers usually receive cadavers via body donation. Body brokers often offer free cremation as a means to induce donation from families who are unable to pay funeral costs, returning ashes of part of the body to the next of kin. In some cases body brokers obtain bodies fraudulently by stating use of the donation for research, subsequently reselling the body for profit.\n\nBody brokers also obtain cadavers and body parts from institutions who receive donations and have a surplus. In some cases, this is done illegally against the donor's wishes or by employees who act independently of the institution. In 2004, the UCLA Willed Body Program was suspended for a year after a scheme for the sale of body parts for profit involving its director at the time Henry Reid and body broker named Ernest Nelson was uncovered..

Capital punishment was abolished from federal criminal law in 1942, but remained available in military criminal law until 1992. The last actual executions in Switzerland took place during World War II.\n\nIn the Middle Ages and Early Modern period, the most common method for execution, at least for males, was the decapitation with the sword. The archivist Gerold Meyer von Knonau has provided statistics for the canton of Zurich from the 15th century up to, and including the 18th century. 1445 persons were condemned to death (1198 men, 247 women). 915 of these were sentenced to be beheaded, 270 hanged, 130 burnt alive, 99 drowned, 26 broken on the wheel, 1 quartered alive, 2 buried alive, 1 immured, and the last one was impaled. The last three execution methods were in use in the 15th century, drowning was discontinued in 1613.\n\nIn 1835, the guillotine was added, although many cantons allowed the person to be executed to choose between these two methods. One of the last people to be executed with a sword was Niklaus Emmenegger in Lucerne on 6 July 1867. Geneviève Guénat, the last woman to be executed, was beheaded by this method in Delsberg, Bern on 7 September 1862, Héli Freymond in Vaud on 11 January 1868. In 1848 the death penalty for political crimes was forbidden by the constitution. In 1874, with the introduction of the new federal constitution in 1874, it was generally abolished throughout the country. However, because of an increase in crime - much due to the economic depression at the time - capital punishment was re-introduced in 1879. The revocation of the ban, however, was not obligatory and only a number of cantons chose to reinstate the penalty on the cantonal level.\n\nOn 21 December 1937 the Federal Assembly of Switzerland adopted the first national criminal code. It abolished capital punishment, which had been provided for by several cantonal criminal codes. The new code was ratified by referendum on 3 July, 1938 and entered into force on 1 January 1942. The last person to be sentenced to death by a civil court and executed was Hans Vollenweider, convicted of three murders and then executed on 18 October 1940 in Sarnen, Obwalden. Due to the impending abolition, Vollenweider's verdict - performed with a guillotine borrowed from Lucerne - was controversial.\n\nSwiss military law, however, still provided for the death penalty for treason and certain other military offenses such as desertion in the face of the enemy. During World War II, 30 people were sentenced to death, and 17 of these were executed before the end of the war. This law was abolished by the Federal Assembly on 20 March 1992 after a parliamentary initiative by Massimo Pini of the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland. The 1999 Swiss Federal Constitution then banned the death penalty at the constitutional level.\n\nTwo initiatives have so far been launched to amend the Constitution to provide for the reintroduction of capital punishment. The first, in 1985, would have made drug dealing punishable by death. It did not manage to collect the required 100,000 signatures for a binding national referendum.\n\nIn August 2010, family members of a murder victim launched another constitutional amendment initiative to provide for capital punishment in cases of murder combined with sexual violence. The initiative quickly found itself at the center of public attention and was roundly rejected by political leaders; it was withdrawn a day after its official publication.\n"}

This article discusses the latter type.\n\nCinnamon basil, also known as Mexican spice basil, has a spicy, fragrant aroma and flavor. It contains methyl cinnamate, giving it a flavor reminiscent of cinnamon. Cinnamon basil has somewhat narrow, slightly serrated, dark green, shiny leaves with reddish-purple veins, which can resemble certain types of mint, and produces small, pink flowers from July to September. Its stems are dark purple. Cinnamon basil grows to 18–30 inches tall.\n\nCinnamon basil is an easy-to-grow herb. It requires six to eight hours of bright sunlight per day. Although it is often grown as an annual, it is a perennial in USDA plant hardiness zones 9–11. Cinnamon basil is sometimes planted near tomatoes and roses to discourage pests such as whiteflies.\n\nCinnamon basil is used in teas and baked goods such as cookies and pies. It is also used in pastas, salads, jellies, and vinegars. Outside the kitchen, cinnamon basil is used in dried arrangements and as a potpourri.\n\nCinnamon basil was taken into space by the Space Shuttle \"Endeavour\" during STS-118 and grown in an experiment in low Earth orbit on the International Space Station.\n"}

Poling\n\nClark Vandersall Poling (August 7, 1910 – February 3, 1943) was a minister in the Reformed Church in America and a lieutenant in the United States Army. He was one of the Four Chaplains who gave their lives to save other soldiers during the sinking of the troop transport during World War II.\n\nPoling was born in Columbus, Ohio to Dr. Daniel Alfred Poling (1884-1968), an Evangelical minister, and Susan Jane Vandersall (1882-1918). He was raised in Auburndale, Massachusetts where he attended Whitney Public School. He had three siblings, Daniel, Mary and Elizabeth. His mother died in 1918; his father remarried in 1919 and converted to the Baptist faith, becoming an ordained minister. The family moved to Poughkeepsie, New York and Poling attended Oakwood School where he excelled on the football team.\n\nAfter graduation he attended Hope College in Michigan and then Rutgers University in New Jersey, graduating in 1933. He then attended Yale Divinity School, graduating in 1936. He then took up a position as pastor of the First Reformed Church in Schenectady, New York where he settled with his wife Elizabeth Jung and their son Clark, Jr. (\"Corky\"). A daughter, Susan Elizabeth, was born three months after his death.\n\nAt the outbreak of war in 1941, Poling immediately volunteered for service as an Army chaplain in the footsteps of his father, who had served as a chaplain during World War I. He initially served in Mississippi with a transport regiment.\n\nIn late 1942, Poling was transferred to Camp Myles Standish in Taunton, Massachusetts and attended Chaplains School at Harvard University. There he met fellow chaplains George L. Fox, Alexander D. Goode and John P. Washington.\nIn January 1943, the chaplains embarked on board the \"Dorchester\", which was transporting over 900 soldiers to the United Kingdom via Greenland.\n\nOn February 2, 1943 the German submarine \"U-223\" spotted the convoy on the move and closed with the ships, firing a torpedo which struck the \"Dorchester\" shortly after midnight. Hundreds of men packed the decks of the rapidly sinking ship and scrambled for the lifeboats. Several of the lifeboats had been damaged and the four chaplains began to organize frightened soldiers. They distributed life jackets from a locker; when the supply of life jackets ran out, each of the chaplains gave theirs to other soldiers. When the last lifeboats were away, the chaplains prayed with those unable to escape the sinking ship. 27 minutes after the torpedo struck, the \"Dorchester\" disappeared below the waves with 672 men still aboard. The last anyone saw of the four chaplains, they were standing on the deck, arms linked and praying together.\n\nThe four chaplains were all awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Purple Heart and received national acclaim for their courage and self-sacrifice. A chapel in their honor was dedicated on February 3, 1951 by President Harry S. Truman at Grace Baptist Church of Philadelphia. The Four Chaplains' Medal was established by act of Congress on July 14, 1960, and was presented posthumously to their next of kin by Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker at Ft. Myer, Virginia on January 18, 1961.\n\nPoling is honored with a feast day along with the other Four Chaplains on the liturgical of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on February 3.\n\nThe high point of the town of Deering, NH, formerly known as Wolf Hill (1570 ft.), was renamed Clark Summit in Poling's honor, and a memorial plaque was placed at the summit outlook. \"Located on what was once family land, Clark thought this was a peaceful place and would often go there to reflect on big decisions in his life. In fact, it was at Wolf Hill's summit that Clark decided to become a minister.\" \n"}
{"id": "1006356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1006356", "title": "Creode", "text": "Creode\n\nCreode or chreod is a neologistic portmanteau term coined by the English 20th century biologist C.H. Waddington to represent the developmental pathway followed by a cell as it grows to form part of a specialized organ. Combining the Greek roots for \"necessary\" and \"path,\" the term was inspired by the property of regulation. When development is disturbed by external forces, the embryo attempts to regulate its growth and differentiation by returning to its normal developmental trajectory.\n\nWaddington used the term along with canalisation and homeorhesis, which describes a system that returns to a steady trajectory, in contrast to homeostasis, which describes a system which returns to a steady state. Waddington explains development with the metaphor of a ball rolling down a hillside, where the hill's contours channel the ball in a particular direction. In the case of a pathway or creode which is deeply carved in the hillside, external disturbance is unlikely to prevent normal development. He notes that creodes tend to have steeper sides earlier in development, when external disturbance rarely suffices to alter the developmental trajectory. Small differences in placement atop the hill can lead to dramatically different results by the time the ball reaches the bottom. This represents the tendency of neighboring regions of the early embryo to develop into different organs with radically different structures. Since intermediate structures rarely exist between organs, each ball that rolls down the hill is \"canalised\" to a region distinct from other regions, just as an eye, for instance, is distinct from an ear.\n\nWaddington refers to the network of creodes carved into the hillside as an \"epigenetic landscape,\" meaning that the formation of the body depends on not only its genetic makeup but the different ways genes are expressed in different regions of the embryo. He expands his metaphor by describing the underside of the epigenetic landscape. Here we see that the \"landscape\" is really more like a giant sheet that would blow away except that a series of tension-bearing cables holds it down. The pegs that connect the cables to the ground are the genes. The cables themselves are the epigenetic factors that influence gene expression in various regions of the embryo. The depth and direction of the channels is thus determined by a combination of genetic makeup and the epigenetic feedback loops by which genes are regulated.\n\nWhile Waddington does assert that the process of development is genetically driven, he makes no attempt to explain how this works and even offers evidence to the contrary. He observes, for instance, that genes ordinarily determine peripheral traits, such as eye color, rather than \"focal\" traits, such as the structure of the eye itself. Moreover, when genetic mutation influences basic structures, the result tends to be the complete transformation of a structure into another rather than piecemeal change, which Waddington illustrates with the developmental ball rolling out of one creode into another. Thus his account gives the impression that genes influence development, perhaps altering the course of a region of cells, without determining the endpoints toward which the embryo develops.\n\nThis interpretation is further reinforced by Waddington's discussion of the organization of the gene pool, where he points out that \"the epigenetic process occurring during the development of the organism might be so buffered or canalized that the optimum end-result is produced irrespective of the genes which the individual contains.\" The more deeply creodes are carved into the epigenetic landscape, the weaker the influence of genes over development. He also argues that deep creodes will resist not only genetic but environmental pressures to change course. This phenomenon, which he calls \"stabilizing selection,\" puts genes and environment on a par in secondary importance compared to the epigenetic system.\n\nWaddington's emphasis on epigenetics over genes prefigured the current interest in evolutionary developmental biology. As Sean B. Carroll and others have explained, genes involved in development are roughly the same in all animal species, from insect to primate. Instead of mutations in developmental genes, evolution has been driven by changes in gene expression, namely which genes are expressed at which times and locations in the developing organism.\n\nArchitectural theorist Sanford Kwinter described the concept of the chreod as \"the most important concept of the 20th century.\" The word \"chreod\" also closely describes paths of decision within what Christopher Alexander has called configuration space, his term for what he notes that Stuart Kaufmann calls \"fitness landscape.\" By Alexander's theory, because conscious human design decisions do not need to follow these chreods, conscious human design can lead to mixed results. Therefore, he proposes that discovering ways to allow architecture to follow these paths is the best way to get good results in the built environment. Alexander sees his theories of \"The Fundamental Process\", \"structure preserving transformations\" and \"15 fundamental properties\" which he outlines in his work \"The Nature of Order\" as instrumentally shaping paths through configuration space.\n\n\n"}

His girlfriend and her two cousins who were in the car with him at the time of his death were injured but survived the assault.\n\nWhile Currie was driving a car along the Southern Motorway in Otahuhu he was struck by an 8 kg block of concrete dropped from the Princess Street overbridge. Currie's girlfriend, Helen McCreadie, in the passenger seat, attempted to regain control of the car, but it crashed after 200 meters.\n\nNgatai Rewiti, who was 14 years old at the time of the incident, was found not guilty of Currie's murder, but guilty of manslaughter on 6 July 2006. Rewiti has been remanded in custody and was sentenced on 6 September. His youth has attracted ongoing press attention.\n\nThe stone block smashed through the windscreen of his car, struck his chin and then his chest. This fractured his sternum, which severed his heart's main artery and instantly killed him. The car then travelled another 120 metres down the motorway before striking a pole, causing minor injuries to the other three occupants of the car. Shortly afterwards the youth was arrested and charged with murder and endangering transport and appeared in the Manakau Youth Court on 23 August.\n\nThere were a spate of \"copycat\" rock-throwing attacks in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Currie. Rocks thrown from highway overpasses is a recurring problem in New Zealand, as are rural roadside attacks on vehicles by organized groups of rock-throwers, and similar attacks on trains.\n\nThe murder trial began on 3 July 2006 in the Auckland High Court. Rewiti had name suppression and was identified only as \"R\" during the trial. The suppression was lifted after the verdict. Rewiti plead not guilty to the murder charge but admitted Currie's manslaughter. Crown Prosecutor Aaron Perkins told the jury that Rewiti did not need to have intended to kill Currie to commit murder. Under the Crimes Act 1961, death resulting from an unlawful act – in this case either an intention to cause him harm or to cause mayhem on the motorway – constitutes murder.\nAmong the prosecution witnesses were Currie's girlfriend who testified that all of a sudden the windscreen shattered and Currie looked like he had been knocked out. Friends of the accused said that on the Monday following the incident, he told them what he had done. One of the friends said that Rewiti sounded proud of his actions. The jury took four hours to reach its not guilty verdict on the murder charge.\n\nThe sentence, 4 years in a youth detention center, with possible parole, \"outraged\" Currie's family.\n\nThe youthful rock thrower, Ngatai Rawiti, is sometimes discussed in the context of New Zealand's difficulty dealing with broken families, youthful gang violence and street crime.\n"}
{"id": "989039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=989039", "title": "Ecological psychology", "text": "Ecological psychology\n\n\"Ecological psychology\" is a term claimed by several schools of psychology with the main one involving the work of James J. Gibson and his associates, and another one the work of Roger G. Barker, Herb Wright and associates at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. Whereas Gibsonian psychology is always termed \"ecological psychology\", the work of Barker (and his followers) is also sometimes referred to as \"environmental psychology\". There is some overlap between the two schools, although the Gibsonian approach is more philosophical and deeply reflective on its predecessors in the history of psychology.\n\nBoth schools emphasise 'real world' studies of behaviour as opposed to the artificial environment of the laboratory.\n\nBarker's work was based on his empirical work at the Midwest Field Station. He wrote later: \"The Midwest Psychological Field Station was established to facilitate the study of human behavior and its environment \"in situ\" by bringing to psychological science the kind of opportunity long available to biologists: easy access to phenomena of the science unaltered by the selection and preparation that occur in laboratories.\" (Barker, 1968). The study of environmental units (behavior settings) grew out of this research. In his classic work \"Ecological Psychology\" (1968) he argued that human behaviour was radically situated: in other words, you couldn't make predictions about human behaviour unless you know what situation or context or environment the human in question was in. For example, there are certain behaviours appropriate to being in church, attending a lecture, working in a factory etc., and the behaviour of people in these environments is more similar than the behaviour of an individual person in different environments. He has since developed these theories in a number of books and articles.\n\nJames J. Gibson, too, stressed the importance of the environment, in particular, the (direct) perception of how the environment of an organism \"affords\" various actions to the organism. Thus, an appropriate analysis of the environment was crucial for an explanation of perceptually guided behaviour. He argued that animals and humans stand in a 'systems' or 'ecological' relation to the environment, such that to adequately explain some behaviour it was necessary to study the environment or niche in which the behaviour took place and, especially, the \"information\" that 'epistemically connects' the organism to the environment.\n\nIt is Gibson's emphasis that the \"foundation\" for perception is ambient, ecologically available information – as opposed to peripheral or internal sensations – that makes Gibson's perspective unique in perceptual science in particular and cognitive science in general. The aphorism: \"Ask not what's inside your head, but what your head's inside of\" captures that idea. Gibson's theory of perception is \"information-based\" rather than sensation-based and to that extent, an analysis of the environment (in terms of affordances), and the concomitant specificational information that the organism detects about such affordances, is central to the ecological approach to perception. Throughout the 1970s and up until his death in 1979, Gibson increased his focus on the environment through development of the theory of affordances - the real, \"perceivable\" opportunities for action in the environment, that are specified by \"ecological information\".\n\nGibson rejected outright indirect perception, in favour of \"ecological realism\", his new form of direct perception that involves the new concept of ecological affordances. He also rejected the emerging constructivist, information processing and cognitivist views that assume and emphasize internal representation and the processing of meaningless, physical sensations ('inputs') in order to create meaningful, mental perceptions ('output'), all supported and implemented by a neurological basis (inside the head). \n\nHis approach to perception has often been criticised and dismissed when compared to widely publicised advances made in the fields of neuroscience and visual perception by the computational and cognitive approaches.\n\nHowever, developments in cognition studies which consider the role of embodied cognition and action in psychology can be seen to support his basic position.\n\nGiven that Gibson's tenet was that \"perception is based on information, not on sensations\", his work and that of his contemporaries today can be seen as crucial for keeping prominent the primary question of \"what\" is perceived (i.e., affordances, via information) – before questions of mechanism and material implementation are considered. Together with a contemporary emphasis on dynamical systems theory and complexity theory as a necessary methodology for investigating the structure of ecological information, the Gibsonian approach has maintained its relevance and applicability to the larger field of cognitive science.\n\n\n"}

Her case attracted nationwide attention in this area as well as in medical ethics.\n\nOn September 3, 1983, Bouvia, at the age of 26, admitted herself into the psychiatric ward of Riverside General Hospital in Riverside, California. She was almost totally paralysed by cerebral palsy and had severe degenerative arthritis, which caused her great pain.\n\nBouvia was alienated from her family and husband, and had been entertaining thoughts of suicide. She requested hospital authorities to allow her to starve to death. When they refused and ordered her to be force-fed, Bouvia contacted the American Civil Liberties Union, which assigned her a lawyer. In the subsequent lawsuit, the court upheld the hospital's decision and ordered force-feeding to continue (Pence 64-65).\n\nFollowing the court case, a bitter dispute broke out among physicians regarding the Bouvia case. Bouvia tried to resist the force-feeding by biting through the feeding tube. Four attendants would then hold her down while the tubing was inserted into her nose and liquids pumped into her stomach.\n\nSome physicians called this battery and torture, while others claimed that the hospital was right to err on the side of continued life (Pence 65).\n\nBouvia appealed the lower court ruling and lost. Now, in addition to the force-feeding, she was hooked up to a morphine drip to ease the pain of her arthritis. Eventually, she appealed again and this time the court ruled in her favour that the force-feeding constituted battery (Pence 68).\n\nAfter the court case, Bouvia decided that she would live. In 1998, she appeared on \"60 Minutes\", saying that she was still in pain and had felt great pressure to continue living; she expressed the hope that she would soon die of natural causes. She was still living in 2002. In its obituary for USC professor Harlan Hahn, the \"Los Angeles Times\" on May 11, 2008, reported that Bouvia was still alive.\n\n"}

{"id": "12744582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12744582", "title": "Everett Strupper", "text": "Everett Strupper\n\nGeorge Everett Strupper Jr. (July 26, 1896 – February 4, 1950), known variously as \"Ev\" or \"Strup\" or \"Stroop\" was an American football player. He played halfback for Georgia Tech from 1915 to 1917. Strupper overcame deafness resulting from a childhood illness and was selected as an All-American in 1917.\n\nDuring Strupper's three years playing for Georgia Tech, the team compiled a record of 24–0–2 and outscored its opponents by a combined score of 1,135 to 61. In Georgia Tech's record-setting 222–0 win over Cumberland College in 1916, Strupper scored eight touchdowns. For many years, 1917 Georgia Tech was considered the greatest football team the South ever produced. Strupper starred as part of a renowned backfield including also Joe Guyon, Judy Harlan, and Al Hill. Strupper and teammate Walker Carpenter were the first players from the Deep South selected for an All-America first team.\n\nSportswriter Morgan Blake called Strupper \"probably the greatest running half-back the South has known.\" Bernie McCarty writes \"Strupper ranks among the greatest broken-field gallopers in Southern football history. And he caught and threw passes, returned kicks, blocked well, punted and played a bang-up defensive game.\" He was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1972 and the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1974.\n\nStrupper was born in Columbus, Georgia, in 1896. His parents, G. Everett Strupper, Sr. (born 1872), and Bessie H. (Hatcher) Strupper (born 1875), were both Georgia natives. As of 1910, his father was employed as a manager at a cotton oil company. Stupper attended Riverside Military Academy in Gainesville, Georgia. He was the star of the school's football team in 1913; and is a member of the school's sports hall of fame.\n\nStrupper enrolled at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta in 1914. During his freshman year, Strupper became a member of the Georgia Phi chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity. He was a multi-sport athlete competing for Georgia Tech in basketball, football, and track and field.\n\nIn 1914, Strupper played for the freshman football team at Georgia Tech. He then played halfback for Georgia Tech's varsity football teams under head coach John Heisman from 1915 to 1917. Strupper was deaf, and because of his deafness, he called the signals instead of the team's quarterback. Strupper was a small man, with his height being stated in varying accounts to be between five-feet seven inches and five-feet, ten inches. His coach John Heisman later wrote that Strupper was \"but 5 feet 7 inches in height, weighed only 148 pounds stripped.\" He was sometimes known as \"little Everett Strupper.\"\n\nGeorgia Tech never lost a game in which Strupper played, compiling three consecutive undefeated seasons from 1915 to 1917. During Strupper's three years playing for Georgia Tech, the team compiled a record of 24–0–2. Only two teams managed a tie – the University of Georgia in 1915 and Washington & Lee in 1916. In those 26 games, Georgia Tech outscored its opponents by a combined score of 1,135 to 61.\n\nGeorgia Tech coach John Heisman later described Strupper as follows:\"Everett Strupper was a small package of condensed lightning when you turned him loose in an open field with a ball you wanted delivered somewhere in the neighborhood of the enemy's goal line. He was small, but he was put together like a high-powered motor. His arms and legs did just what his mind told them to do, and, believe me, his mind worked faster than Ty Cobb's when he's running the bases. Dodging and twisting, stiff-arming and hipping, he'd run the gauntlet of men big enough, you'd think, to pick him up and spank him, and most of the time, too, he'd get away from them, try as hard as they would.\"\n\nHeisman also said of Strupper \"Were I compelled to risk my head on what one absolutely unaided gridster might accomplish, football under arm and facing eleven ferocious opponents, I would rather choose and chance this man on how he might come through the gauntlet than any ball carrier I have ever seen in action.\"\n\nHeisman recalled that, when Strupper first arrived from Riverside Military Academy, Heisman could not imagine Strupper playing on the football team: \"Too light for the line, I didn't see how he could play in the backfield, because he wouldn't be able to get the signals. He could have played quarterback fine, but his enunciation wasn't clear enough for him to call the plays.\" Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame the obstacle posed by his deafness: \"He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could read your lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out the minute he began looking for openings through which to run the ball.\" He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869–1919 era team.\n\nIn his sophomore year, Strupper proved to be an all-around athlete. As Heisman told it, Strupper \"was a star baseball player, a crack at basketball and the best sprint man we had in the school.\" Heisman recalled that, despite his small stature, Strupper had a powerful body: \"Stripped down in the dressing rooms Everett was a sight to behold. There never was a better set up lad than he; he was a regular Apollo, beautifully muscled and built and coordinating rhythmically in every movement.\"\n\nWhen Strupper tried out for the team, he noticed that the quarterback would shout the signals every time Strupper was to carry the ball. Realizing the loud signals would be a tip-off to the opposition, Strupper told Heisman, \"Coach, those loud signals are absolutely unnecessary. You see when sickness in my kid days brought on this deafness my folks gave me the best instructors obtainable to teach me lip-reading.\"\n\nStrupper first starred in a game against Transylvania, scoring four touchdowns. He was injured the next week against LSU, and blamed LSU's Phillip Cooper.\n\nTech closed what was then the greatest season in its history with a 7–0 defeat of the Auburn Plainsmen. To begin the second quarter, Strupper had two key plays, the last of which was the game-deciding touchdown. First he made 20 yards around with a pass from Froggie Morrison before being forced out of bounds. Next was the 19-yard touchdown. Strupper started around left end, then cut back into the center of the field, away from his blockers. He juked and eluded \"every man on the Auburn team.\" On the last move Strupper faked right and then dove left underneath the outstretched arms of Baby Taylor into the endzone.\n\nAt the end of the 1915 season, Strupper received two selections from a composite All-Southern eleven selected by ten sports writers and coaches, including those from Memphis, Nashville, Atlanta, Birmingham, Chattanooga, and New Orleans.\n\nIn 1916, Strupper had a 92-yard punt return for a touchdown on opening day against Mercer. The next week, Strupper led Georgia Tech in a 222–0 victory over Cumberland College, \"the most lopsided game in football history.\" The score (compiled on 32 touchdowns and 30 extra points) broke the old record of a 153–0 set by the University of Michigan in 1912. Strupper scored eight touchdowns in the game, six rushing and two on punt returns. One historic account of the 1916 Cumberland game described Strupper as the \"lord high executioner\":\"There were many executioners that crisp early-fall Saturday. Halfback G.E. Strupper scored from 20 yards out on Tech's first offensive play and went on to be lord high executioner with eight touchdowns and a conversion for a total of 49 points.\"\nIn the first quarter alone, Strupper scored four touchdowns on runs of 20, 10, 60, and 45 yards. Strupper chose to allow others to share in the scoring. With a 42–0 lead midway through the first quarter, Strupper broke clear and could have scored easily, but he intentionally grounded the ball at the one-yard line to allow Georgia Tech tackle J. Cantey Alexander to score the first touchdown of his career. A teammate later recalled the play as follows:\"Strupper swapped positions with Alexander ... The team didn't want to make it too easy for Cantey, though. The other boys wouldn't block for him or help in any way. As soon as the ball was snapped, they ran away from the line and out of the play completely. Leaving poor Cantey to go it alone. Finally, on fourth down, a bruised and weary Alexander managed to get the ball across while his teammates howled with laughter.\"\nThe game was eventually halted after just 44 minutes of play. It was said only one newspaper in all of the South neglected to have Strupper on its All-Southern team for 1916. He ranked third in the nation in scoring, including 16 touchdowns.\n\nStrupper also played on the 1917 team then considered the greatest the South ever produced, including one of the greatest backfields. According to the \"Times-Picayune\", \"Strupper, Guyon, Hill, and Harlan form a backfield with no superiors and few equals in football history\". Tech gave Vanderbilt its worst loss in school history 83–0. \"It was not until 1917 that a Southern team really avenged long-time torment at McGugin's hands. And it took one of history's top backfields–Joe Guyon, Ev Strupper, Al Hill, and Judy Harlan of Georgia Tech–to do it,\" writes Edwin Pope. The team also defeated the University of Pennsylvania, then one of the Eastern powers, 41–0. It was called by one writer \"Strupper's finest hour.\" In a 98–0 win over the Carlisle Indians in 1917, Strupper drew praise for his performance. The \"Atlanta Journal\" wrote:\"Everett Strupper played like a veritable demon. At one time four Carlisle men pounced on him from all directions, and yet through some superhuman witchery he broke loose and dashed 10 yards further. On another occasion he attempted a wide end run, found that he was completely blocked, then suddenly whirled and ran the other way, gaining something like 25 yards before he was downed.\"\n\nStrupper scored five touchdowns against Carlisle, including a 32-yard fumble return for a touchdown. And in a 68–7 win over rival Auburn, Strupper had a 65-yard touchdown run that drew the following praise from the \"Atlanta Journal\":\"It was not the length of the run that featured it was the brilliance of it. After getting through the first line, Stroop was tackled squarely by two secondary men, and yet he squirmed and jerked loosed from them, only to face the safety man and another Tiger, coming at him from different angles. Without checking his speed Everett knifed the two men completely, running between them and dashing on to a touchdown.\"\n\nRemarkably, two Georgia Tech players led the country in touchdowns for the 1917 season. Quarterback Albert Hill was first with 23 touchdowns, and Strupper was second with 20 touchdowns. Strupper rushed for some 1,150 yards on a little over 100 carries.\n\nStrupper has been recognized as a consensus first-team player on the 1917 College Football All-America Team, having received first-team honors from Frank Menke Syndicate, Paul Purman, and Dick Jemison of the \"Atlanta Constitution\". Strupper and team captain Walker Carpenter were the first players from the Deep South selected for an All-America first team. Strupper was named as one of four backs on Georgia Tech's \"All-Era\" team for the Heisman era covering the years from 1904 to 1919.\n\nOn December 8, 1917, Strupper was elected by his teammates to be the captain of the 1918 Georgia Tech football team. However, Strupper enlisted in the U. S. Army on August 28, 1918, and was assigned to the First Replacement Regiment at Camp Gordon in Augusta, Georgia. In October 1918, Strupper transferred to Camp Hancock and promoted to the rank of sergeant. He played football for Camp Gordon and Camp Hancock teams. In November 1918, Camp Gordon played a game in Strupper's home town of Columbus, Georgia, and the locals held \"Strupper Day\" in his honor. In a game for Camp Gordon on December 7, 1918, he had two runs of 80 yards and scored four touchdowns. At the end of the season, he was picked as a second-team halfback on Walter Camp's All-America service team.\n\nThe war ended in November 1918, and Strupper was discharged from the Army on December 20, 1918, as part of the post-war demobilization. In August 1919, Strupper accepted a job as the backfield coach for Oglethorpe University. He next led the Columbus High School football team. Strupper was an assistant coach under Josh Cody at Mercer in 1922.\n\nStrupper was married in approximately 1920 to his wife, Odelle. As of 1921, Strupper was living in Columbus, Georgia, working as a salesman for E. F. Gray. From at least 1925 to 1928, Strupper was living in Columbus with his wife, Odelle, and operating a tire business under the name Everett Strupper, Inc. The business sold Dunlop Tires and also provided vulcanizing, road service, washing, greasing and oil. \n\nBy 1930, Strupper and his wife, Odelle, had moved to Atlanta where he was employed as the sales manager for an automobile accessories business. He was also a contributor to the \"Atlanta Journal\". Although there are competing stories as to the origin of the Red Elephant mascot for the University of Alabama, some sources have cited a story written by Strupper about an October 1930 football game between Alabama and Mississippi. Strupper wrote: \"At the end of the quarter, the earth started to tremble, there was a distant rumble that continued to grow. Some excited fan in the stands bellowed, 'Hold your horses, the elephants are coming,' and out stamped this Alabama varsity.\"\n\nBy 1934, he was working as a solicitor for the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. He worked with former teammate, Pup Phillips, at Massachusetts Mutual. As of 1941, Strupper was still living in Atlanta and employed by Massachusetts Mutual. His spouse, apparently a second wife, was identified as Frances C. Strupper.\n\nStrupper later became a general agent for the Volunteer State Life Insurance Company, and by 1948, he became the president of the Piedmont Life Insurance Co. based in Atlanta.\n\nStrupper died at his home in Atlanta's Georgian Terrace Hotel in February 1950 from thrombosis. He was age 57 at the time of his death. He was survived by a wife and a step-daughter, Gwyneth Oliver. He was buried in Columbus, Georgia.\n\nIn 1972, the National Football Foundation named Strupper and nine others players who played before 1920 to the \"Pioneer\" section of the College Football Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Georgia Tech Athletics Hall of Fame in 1956 and the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1974.\n\n"}
{"id": "3654208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3654208", "title": "Fascination with death", "text": "Fascination with death\n\nFascination with death has occurred throughout human history, characterized by obsessions with death and all things related to death and the afterlife.\n\nIn past times, people would form cults around death and figures. Famously, Anubis, Osiris, Hades, and La Santa Muerte have all had large cult followings. La Santa Muerte (Saint Death), or the personification of death, is currently worshiped by many in Mexico and other countries in Central America. Day of the Dead (2 November), is a celebration for the dead.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians are most famous for their fascination of death by mummifying their dead and building exquisite tombs, like the pyramids of Giza, for their dead. Many of their deities were death-related, such as: Ammut, the devourer of unworthy souls; Anubis, the guardian of the Necropolis and the keeper of poisons, medicines, and herbs; and Osiris, the king of the dead.\n\nThe Greek underworld, Hades, was ruled by the god Hades, and had five rivers that flowed through it. The rivers were: Acheron, river of sadness; Cocytus, river of lamentation; Lethe, river of forgetfulness; Phlegethon, river of fire; Styx, river of hate. The Underworld had attendants who, though not rulers, were important gods and beings. The Furies were female spirits who exacted vengeance against people who committed specific crimes. Keres were female spirits of death and destruction. Persephone was the goddess of the underworld and the spouse of Hades. Thanatos, the god of death, was said to wear dark robes.\n\nThe Vikings believed that if a warrior died in battle, he would be taken to the Norse afterlife: the hall of Valhöll, in which the warriors would prepare for Ragnarökk, the battle at the end of the world. Rune stones were erected to commemorate particularly brave warriors. Death in one's sleep (a \"straw death\") was considered dishonorable.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, it was common to hold séances at dinner parties. A séance is an event where a group of people (3 or more) try to communicate with the dead through one person of the group, known as a psychic medium.\n\nThis fascination with death in Western Culture can be observed in many of Walt Disney's fairytales. After being responsible for the death of an owl on his family's farm when he was 7 years old, he was haunted by the experience and other influences of death in his life, leading to a strong correlation with death in his children's stories.\n\nToday there are a number of authors who have spoken on the fascination people have with death. \"If it bleeds, it leads\" is a phrase related to this, meaning that in the mass media most of the material is based on death. For example: death and crime are almost always a topic in the news. The goth and metal subcultures are often associated with death and dying.\n\nDaniel Kahneman and others have studied the psychology behind this. For example, people buy insurance and make other decisions based on what comes readily to mind—e.g., the previously recorded high-water mark for a flood, rarely considering that something worse is possible and in many cases eventually likely. This interacts with the management policies of media outlets to create availability cascades and media feeding frenzies: For example, \"strokes cause almost twice as many deaths as all accidents combined, but 80% of respondents [in a survey] judged accidental death to be more likely. ... [This is because media] coverage is itself biased toward novelty and poignancy. The media do not just shape what the public is interested in, but also are shaped by it.\"\n\nThis fascination with death and interaction with media editorial policies sometimes has problematic consequences for public policy. For example, Vincent Sacco and others described how the mainstream commercial media in the United States changed their editorial policies in the 1970s to focus more on the police blotter. The human psychology behind \"If it bleeds, it leads\" meant they could retain or even increase their audience while reducing the cost of producing the news: Investigative journalism is enormously expensive, especially if it offends a major advertiser. Focusing on crimes apparently committed by people without substantive political or economic power is cheap. The resulting increase in crime stories convinced the US electorate that crime was out of control. This led to the election of politicians who would \"get tough on crime.\" The result was a five-fold increase in the United States incarceration rate not justified by any actual increase in crime.\n\n'Necrophilia' is generally used in English to refer to the paraphilia associated with dead bodies, although the term has been used in a broader sense and in foreign language merely to refer to 'a fascination with death.'\n\n\n\n"}

Worried that he would be forced to have Pal put down, the original owner gave the large dog to The Royal Rifles of Canada, a regiment of the Canadian Army stationed at Gander International Airport, Newfoundland and Labrador. The soldiers quickly renamed him Gander and \"promoted\" him to sergeant. When the unit was shipped to Hong Kong in the fall of 1941, Gander went along.\n\nThe Battle of Hong Kong began on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Gander helped fight the Japanese invaders on three occasions. The last time, Gander picked up a thrown Japanese hand grenade and rushed with it toward the enemy, dying in the ensuing explosion, but saving the lives of several wounded Canadian soldiers.\n\nAfter efforts by the Canadian War Museum, the Hong Kong Veterans Association, and the Hong Kong Veterans Commemorative Association, the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals awarded Gander the Dickin Medal on October 27, 2000, the first such award since 1949. The Dickin Medal is often referred to as the animal metaphorical equivalent of the Victoria Cross. The citation reads:\n\nFor saving the lives of Canadian infantrymen during the Battle of Lye Mun on Hong Kong Island in December 1941. On three documented occasions, Gander, the Newfoundland mascot of The Royal Rifles of Canada, engaged the enemy as his regiment joined The Winnipeg Grenadiers, members of Battalion Headquarters \"C\" Force and other Commonwealth troops in their courageous defence of the island. Twice Gander's attacks halted the enemy's advance and protected groups of wounded soldiers. In a final act of bravery, the war dog was killed in action gathering a grenade. Without Gander's intervention, many more lives would have been lost in the assault.\n\nAt the insistence of survivors of the battle, his name was listed with those of 1975 men and two women on the Hong Kong Veterans Memorial Wall in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\nOn July 23, 2015, statues of Gander and his handler were unveiled at Gander Heritage Memorial Park in Gander, Newfoundland.\n\nThe Forgotten Heroes monument at the Cobequid Veterans Memorial Park in Bass River, Nova Scotia, initiated as an elementary school project and designed by 11-year-old Noah Tremblay, commemorates heroic animals.

The aircraft, an Airbus A300, was destroyed and all 290 people on board, including 66 children, were killed. The jet was hit while flying over Iran's territorial waters in the Persian Gulf, along the flight's usual route, shortly after departing Bandar Abbas International Airport, the flight's stopover location. \"Vincennes\" had entered Iranian territory after one of its helicopters drew warning fire from Iranian speedboats operating within Iranian territorial limits.\n\nThe reason for the shootdown has been disputed between the governments of the two countries. According to the United States government, the crew of USS \"Vincennes\" had incorrectly identified the Airbus as an attacking F-14 Tomcat, a U.S.-made jet fighter that had been part of the Iranian Air Force inventory since the 1970s. While the F-14s had been supplied to Iran in an air-to-air configuration, the crew of the guided missile cruiser had been briefed that the Iranian F-14s were equipped with air-to-ground ordnance. \"Vincennes\" had made ten attempts to contact the aircraft on both military and civilian radio frequencies, but had received no response. The International Civil Aviation Organization said that the flight crew should have been monitoring the civilian frequency. According to the Iranian government, the cruiser negligently shot down the aircraft, which was transmitting IFF squawks in Mode III, a signal that identified it as a civilian aircraft, and not Mode II as used by Iranian military aircraft. The event generated a great deal of criticism of the United States. Some analysts blamed the captain of \"Vincennes\", William C. Rogers III, for overly-aggressive behavior in a tense and dangerous environment.\n\nIn 1996, the governments of the United States and Iran reached a settlement at the International Court of Justice which included the statement \"...the United States recognized the aerial incident of 3 July 1988 as a terrible human tragedy and expressed deep regret over the loss of lives caused by the incident...\" As part of the settlement, even though the U.S. government did not admit legal liability or formally apologize to Iran, it still agreed to pay US$61.8 million on an \"ex gratia\" basis, amounting to $213,103.45 per passenger, in compensation to the families of the Iranian victims.\n\nIn 1984, the to include air attacks against oil tankers and merchant shipping of neighboring countries, some of whom were providing aid to Iraq by shipping Iraqi oil. The Flight 655 incident occurred a year after the Iraqi Air Force attack on the U.S. Navy guided-missile frigate on 17 May 1987, which killed 37 American sailors. U.S. naval forces had also exchanged gunfire with Iranian gunboats in late 1987, and the U.S. Navy guided-missile frigate had struck an Iranian sea mine in April 1988. Two months before the incident, the U.S. had engaged in Operation Praying Mantis, resulting in the sinking of the Iranian frigate \"Sahand\". Tensions were therefore high in the Strait of Hormuz at the time of the incident with Flight 655.\n\nIn response to the pattern of attacks on shipping, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a NOTAM on 8 September 1987 warning all Persian Gulf countries that civilian aircraft must monitor the 121.5 MHz VHF International Air Distress or the 243.0 MHz UHF Military Air Distress frequencies and be prepared to identify themselves to U.S. Navy ships and state their intentions.\n\nOn 29 April 1988, the U.S. expanded the scope of its navy's protection to all friendly neutral shipping in the Persian Gulf outside declared exclusion zones, which set the stage for the shootdown. At about the same time, was rushed to the area on a short-notice deployment, as a result of high-level decisions, to compensate for the lack of AWACS coverage, which was hampering U.S. monitoring of the southern Persian Gulf. \"Vincennes\", fitted with the then-new Aegis Combat System and under the command of Captain William C. Rogers III, departed San Diego on 25 April 1988 and arrived in Bahrain on 29 May 1988.\n\nAs the Strait of Hormuz at its narrowest is wide, in order to traverse the strait, ships must stay within sea lanes that pass through the territorial waters of Iran and Oman under the transit passage provisions of customary Law of the Sea. It is therefore normal for ships, including warships, entering or leaving the Persian Gulf to transit Iranian territorial waters. During the Iran–Iraq War the Iranian forces frequently boarded and inspected neutral cargo ships in the Strait of Hormuz in search of contraband destined for Iraq. While legal under international law, these inspections added to the tensions in the area.\n\nThe plane, an Airbus A300 (registered as ), flown by 37-year-old Captain Mohsen Rezaian, a veteran pilot with 7,000 hours of flight time, left Bandar Abbas at 10:17 Iran time (UTC+03:30), 27 minutes after its scheduled departure time. It should have been a 28-minute flight. After takeoff, it was directed by the Bandar Abbas tower to turn on its transponder and proceed over the Persian Gulf. The flight was assigned routinely to commercial air corridor Amber 59, a 20-mile (32 km)-wide lane on a direct line to Dubai airport. The short distance made for a simple flight pattern: climb to , cruise, and descend into Dubai. The airliner was transmitting the correct transponder \"squawk\" code typical of a civilian aircraft and maintained radio contact in English with appropriate air traffic control facilities.\nOn the morning of 3 July, USS \"Vincennes\" was passing through the Strait of Hormuz returning from an escort duty. A helicopter deployed from the cruiser reportedly received small arms fire from Iranian patrol vessels as it observed from high altitude. \"Vincennes\" moved to engage the Iranian vessels, in the course of which they all violated Omani waters and left after being challenged and ordered to leave by a Royal Navy of Oman warship. \"Vincennes\" then pursued the Iranian gunboats, entering Iranian territorial waters to open fire. and were nearby. Thus, \"Vincennes\" was in Iranian territorial waters at the time of the incident, as admitted by the U.S. government in legal briefs and publicly by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William J. Crowe, on \"Nightline\". Admiral Crowe denied a U.S. government coverup of the incident and claimed that the cruiser's helicopter was over international waters initially, when the gunboats first fired upon it.\n\nContrary to the accounts of various \"Vincennes\" crew members, the cruiser's Aegis Combat System recorded that the airliner was climbing at the time and its radio transmitter was squawking on only the Mode III civilian frequency, and not on the military Mode II.\n\nAfter receiving no response to multiple radio challenges, and believing the airliner was an Iranian F-14 Tomcat (capable of carrying unguided bombs since 1985) diving into an attack profile, \"Vincennes\" fired two SM-2MR surface-to-air missiles, one of which hit the airliner. The plane disintegrated immediately and crashed into the water soon after. None of the 290 passengers and crew on board survived.\n\nAccording to the documents that Iran submitted to the International Court of Justice, the aircraft was carrying 290 people: 274 passengers and a crew of 16. Of these 290, 254 were Iranian, 13 were Emiratis, 10 were Indians, six were Pakistanis, six were Yugoslavs and one was an Italian.\n\nAccording to the U.S. government, USS \"Vincennes\" mistakenly identified the airliner as an attacking military fighter and misidentified its flight profile as being similar to that of an F-14A Tomcat during an attack run; however, the cruiser's Aegis Combat System recorded the plane's flight plan as climbing (not descending as in an attack run) at the time of the incident. The flight had originated at Bandar Abbas, which served as both a base for Iranian F-14 operations and as a hub for commercial civilian flights. According to the same reports, \"Vincennes\" unsuccessfully tried to contact the approaching aircraft, seven times on the military emergency frequency and three times on the civilian emergency frequency, but never on air traffic control frequencies. This civilian aircraft was not equipped to pick up military frequencies and the messages on the civilian emergency channel could have been directed at any aircraft. More confusion arose as the hailed speed was the ground speed, while the pilot's instruments displayed airspeed, a difference.\n\nThe crew of \"Vincennes\" realized only after the attack that the plane was a civilian airliner.\n\nThis version was finalized in a report by Admiral William Fogarty, entitled \"Formal Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Downing of Iran Air Flight 655 on 3 July 1988\" (the \"Fogarty report\") Only parts of this report have been released (part I in 1988 and part II in 1993). The Fogarty report stated, \"The data from USS \"Vincennes\" tapes, information from USS \"Sides\" and reliable intelligence information, corroborate the fact that [Iran Air Flight 655] was on a normal commercial air flight plan profile, in the assigned airway, squawking Mode III 6760, on a continuous ascent in altitude from take-off at Bandar Abbas to shoot-down\".\n\nThe Fogarty report also stated, \"Iran must share the responsibility for the tragedy by hazarding one of their civilian airliners by allowing it to fly a relatively low altitude air route in Close proximity to hostilities that had been ongoing\".\n\nWhen questioned in a 2000 BBC documentary, the U.S. government stated in a written answer that they believed the incident may have been caused by a simultaneous psychological condition amongst the eighteen bridge crew of \"Vincennes\", called \"scenario fulfillment\", which is said to occur when persons are under pressure. In such a situation, the men will carry out a training scenario, believing it to be reality while ignoring sensory information that contradicts the scenario. In the case of this incident, the scenario was an attack by a lone military aircraft.\n\nAccording to the Iranian government, the shootdown was an intentionally performed and unlawful act. Even if there was a mistaken identification, which Iran never accepted, it argues that this constituted negligence and recklessness amounting to an international crime, not an accident.\n\nIn particular, Iran expressed skepticism about claims of misidentification, noting that the cruiser's advanced Aegis radar correctly tracked the flight and its Mode III beacon; two other U.S. warships in the area, \"Sides\" and \"Montgomery,\" also identified the aircraft as civilian; and the flight was well within a recognized international air corridor. It also noted that the crew of \"Vincennes\" were trained to handle simultaneous attacks by hundreds of enemy aircraft. Iran finds it more plausible that \"Vincennes\" \"hankered for an opportunity to show its stuff\".\n\nAccording to Iran, the U.S. had previously issued a \"Notice to Airmen\" (NOTAM) warning aircraft that they were at risk of \"defensive measures\" if they had not been cleared from a regional airport and if they came within of a warship at an altitude of less than . Flight 655 had been cleared from a regional airport and was well outside those limits when it was attacked. Even if the plane had truly been an Iranian F-14, Iran argued that the U.S. would not have had the right to shoot it down, as it was flying within Iranian airspace and did not follow a path that could be considered an attack profile, nor did it illuminate \"Vincennes\" with radar. Prior to the incident, \"Vincennes\" had entered Iranian territorial waters, and was inside these waters when it launched its missiles. Even had the crew of Flight 655 made mistakes, the U.S. government would still remain responsible for the actions of \"Vincennes\" crew, under international law.\n\nIran pointed out that in the past \"the United States has steadfastly condemned the shooting down of aircraft, whether civil or military, by the armed forces of another State\" and cited El Al Flight 402, Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114 and Korean Air Lines Flight 007, among other incidents. Iran also noted that when Iraq attacked , United States found Iraq fully responsible on the grounds that the Iraqi pilot \"knew or should have known\" that he was attacking a U.S. warship.\n\nIn an article published in \"Newsweek\" magazine on 13 July 1992, John Barry and Roger Charles argued that Rogers behaved recklessly and without due care. However, the subsequent Fogarty report concluded that Rogers acted in a prudent manner based on the information available to him, and the short time frame involved. He also proceeded according to the prescribed rules of engagement for USN warship captains in that situation.\n\nThey also accused the U.S. government of a cover-up, but Admiral Crowe denied any knowledge.\nAn analysis of the events by the International Strategic Studies Association described the deployment of an Aegis cruiser in the zone as irresponsible and felt that the value placed on Aegis cruisers by the U.S. Navy had played a major part in the setting of a low threshold for opening fire. \"Vincennes\" had been nicknamed \"RoboCruiser\" by crew members and other U.S. Navy ships, both in reference to its Aegis system, and to the supposed aggressive tendencies of its captain.\n\nThe International Court of Justice case relating to the attack, \"the Aerial Incident of July 3, 1988, (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America)\", was dropped on 22 February 1996 following settlement and reparations by the United States.\n\nThree years after the incident, Admiral Crowe admitted on American television show \"Nightline\" that \"Vincennes\" was inside Iranian territorial waters when it launched the missiles. This contradicted earlier navy statements.\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) report of December 1988 placed USS \"Vincennes\" well inside Iran's territorial waters.\n\nCommander David Carlson, commanding officer of USS \"Sides\", the warship stationed nearest to \"Vincennes\" at the time of the incident, is reported to have said that the destruction of the aircraft \"marked the horrifying climax to Captain Rogers's aggressiveness, first seen four weeks ago\". His comment referred to incidents on 2 June, when Rogers had sailed \"Vincennes\" too close to an Iranian frigate undertaking a lawful search of a bulk carrier, launched a helicopter within of a small Iranian craft despite rules of engagement requiring a four-mile (6.4 km) separation, and opened fire on small Iranian military boats. Of those incidents, Carlson commented, \"Why do you want an Aegis cruiser out there shooting up boats? It wasn't a smart thing to do.\" He also said that Iranian forces he had encountered in the area a month prior to the incident were \"pointedly non-threatening\" and professional. At the time of Rogers's announcement to higher command that he was going to shoot down the plane, Carlson is reported to have been thunderstruck: \"I said to folks around me, 'Why, what the hell is he doing?' I went through the drill again. F-14. He's climbing. By now this damn thing is at 7,000 feet.\" Carlson thought \"Vincennes\" might have more information, and was unaware that Rogers had been wrongly informed that the plane was diving. Carlson is also reported to have written in the U.S. Naval Proceedings that he had \"wondered aloud in disbelief\" on hearing of \"Vincennes\" intentions, speculating that the ship, known as \"RoboCruiser\" for its aggressiveness, \"felt a need to prove the viability of Aegis in the Persian Gulf, and that they hankered for the opportunity to show their stuff.\"\n\nA slide presentation given by graduate students on M.I.T.'s \"Aeronautics & Astronautics\" course in Spring 2004, titled \"USS Vincennes Incident\", included a comment that Captain Rogers had \"an undeniable and unequivocal tendency towards what I call 'picking a fight. On his own initiative, Rogers moved \"Vincennes\" northeast to join USS \"Montgomery\". An angry Captain Richard McKenna, Chief of Surface Warfare for the Commander of the Joint Task Force, ordered Rogers back to Abu Musa, but a \"Vincennes\" helicopter pilot, Lt. Mark Collier, followed the Iranian speedboats as they retreated north, eventually taking some fire:\nThroughout its final flight, Flight 655 was in radio contact with various air traffic control services using standard civil aviation frequencies, and had spoken in English to Bandar Abbas Approach Control seconds before \"Vincennes\" launched its missiles. According to the U.S. Navy investigation, \"Vincennes\" at that time had no equipment suitable for monitoring civil aviation frequencies, other than the International Air Distress frequency. Subsequently U.S. Navy warships in the area were equipped with dialable VHF radios, and access to flight plan information was sought, to better track commercial airliners.\n\nThe official ICAO report stated that 10 attempts were made to contact Iran Air flight 655: seven on military frequencies and three on commercial frequencies, addressed to an \"unidentified Iranian aircraft\" and giving its speed as , which was the ground speed of the aircraft their radar reported. Flight 655's crew, however, would have seen a speed of on their cockpit instruments, which was their indicated airspeed, possibly leading them to conclude that \"Vincennes\" was talking to another aircraft. Both \"Sides\" and \"Vincennes\" tried contacting flight 655 on several civilian and military frequencies. International investigations concluded that the Flight 655's crew assumed that the three calls that they received before the missiles struck must have been directed at an Iranian P-3 Orion (see below).\n\n\nRobert Entman of George Washington University studied coverage surrounding the incident in U.S. media, comparing it to the similar incident that happened to Korean Air Lines Flight 007, which was shot down by the Soviet Union five years earlier. Using material from \"Time\", \"Newsweek\", \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\" and \"CBS Evening News\", the research found clearly evident framing techniques used to demonize and blame the foreign enemy. He stated that by \"de-emphasizing the agency and the victims and by the choice of graphics and adjectives, the news stories about the U.S. downing of an Iranian plane called it a technical problem while the Soviet downing of a Korean jet was portrayed as a moral outrage\". However, it is also well noted that the Soviet aircraft had visual contact with the Korean airliner and did not try to make radio contact. The Soviet aircraft then also fired on them at point blank range. Additionally, there were no reported enemy aircraft with weapons when the Soviets downed the Korean aircraft, as was the case with the USS \"Vincennes\".\nThe study is important not only because it demonstrates the ethnocentric media bias, but also because Entman included polling that appears to show that the unbalanced coverage swayed public opinion against the Soviet Union and Iran.\n\nIn July 2014, when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in Ukraine, some commentators noted the discrepancy of U.S. official position and media coverage of the two similar incidents.\n\nThe event sparked an intense international controversy, with Iran condemning the attack. In mid-July 1988, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati asked the United Nations Security Council to condemn the United States saying the attack \"could not have been a mistake\" and was a \"criminal act\", a \"massacre\", and an \"atrocity\". George H. W. Bush, at the time vice president of the United States in the Reagan administration, defended his country at the United Nations by arguing that the U.S. attack had been a wartime incident and that the crew of \"Vincennes\" had acted appropriately to the situation. The Soviet Union asked the U.S. to withdraw from the area and supported efforts by the Security Council to end the Iran–Iraq War. Most of the remainder of the 13 delegates who spoke supported the U.S. position, saying one of the problems was that a 1987 resolution to end the Iran-Iraq war had been ignored. Following the debate, Security Council Resolution 616 was passed expressing \"deep distress\" over the U.S. attack and \"profound regret\" for the loss of human lives, and stressing the need to end the Iran–Iraq War as resolved in 1987.\n\nInside Iran, this shootdown was perceived as a purposeful attack by United States, signalling that the U.S. was about to enter into a direct war against Iran on the side of Iraq. In August 1988, a month after the shoot-down, the Iranian government released a 45 rial postage stamp illustrating the event, where the ship shooting the missile is painted with the colors of the American flag, with a map of a burning Iran in the background.\n\nIn February 1996, the United States agreed to pay Iran US$131.8 million in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice relating to this incident, together with other earlier claims before the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal. US$61.8 million of the claim was in compensation for the 248 Iranians killed in the shoot-down: $300,000 per wage-earning victim and $150,000 per non-wage-earner. In total, 290 civilians on board were killed, 38 being non-Iranians and 66 being children. It was not disclosed how the remaining $70 million of the settlement was apportioned, though it was close to the value of a used A300 at the time.\n\nThe U.S. government issued notes of regret for the loss of human lives, but never formally apologized or acknowledged wrongdoing.\nGeorge H. W. Bush, the vice president of the United States at the time commented on a separate occasion, speaking to a group of Republican ethnic leaders (7 Aug 1988): \"I will never apologize for the United States — I don't care what the facts are... I'm not an apologize-for-America kind of guy.\" The quote, although unrelated to the downing of the Iranian air liner, has been attributed as such.\n\nBush used the phrase frequently during the 1988 campaign and promised to \"never apologize for the United States\" months prior to the July 1988 shoot-down and as early as January 1988.\n\nThe incident overshadowed Iran–United States relations for many years. The former CIA analyst Kenneth M. Pollack wrote: \"The shoot-down of Iran Air flight 655 was an accident, but that is not how it was seen in Tehran.\" Following the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 five months later, the British and American governments initially blamed the PFLP-GC, a Palestinian militant group backed by Syria, with assumptions of assistance from Iran in retaliation for Flight 655.\n\nDespite the mistakes made in the downing of the plane, the men of USS \"Vincennes\" were awarded Combat Action Ribbons for completion of their tours in a combat zone. The air-warfare coordinator on duty received the Navy Commendation Medal, but \"The Washington Post\" reported in 1990 that the awards were for his entire tour from 1984 to 1988 and for his actions relating to the surface engagement with Iranian gunboats. In 1990, Rogers was awarded the Legion of Merit \"for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service as commanding officer [...] from April 1987 to May 1989.\" The award was given for his service as the commanding officer of \"Vincennes\" from April 1987 to May 1989. The citation made no mention of the downing of Iran Air 655.\n\nThe events of Flight 655 were featured in \"Mistaken Identity\", a Season 3 (2005) episode of the Canadian TV series \"Mayday\" (called \"Air Emergency\" and \"Air Disasters\" in the U.S. and \"Air Crash Investigation\" in the UK and elsewhere around the world).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Sanford\n\nJohn Francis Alexander Sanford (1806–1857) was a frontiersman of the American west who worked with Native American tribes as an Indian agent. He later joined Pierre Chouteau, Jr. in a fur trapping and trading business. He extended his interests into other areas of commerce and became very wealthy. In the final years of his life he was involved with the landmark court case of \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" [\"sic\"], which is perhaps what he is best known for today. He suffered mental illness and died in an asylum.\n\nSanford's parents were Francis Alexander Sanford (\"c.\" 1782-1848) and Mary Adams. His step mother, from his father's later marriage, was also named Mary. Before about 1810 they lived in Westmoreland County, Virginia and after this date up to 1829 their home was in Winchester, Virginia. John F. A. Sanford, the eldest child of seven, attended the academy at West Point, and in 1825 became a clerk and interpreter in the St Louis office of Indian Affairs under William Clark. In 1826 he was appointed as a sub-agent in the remote Mandan villages of the upper Missouri. He replaced the former agent, 29-year-old Peter Wilson, who had died earlier that year after being taken ill in a Mandan settlement.\n\nFor a period of about seven years Sanford worked with several tribes including Minitarees, Crows, Arikaras, Assiniboines, Knisteneaux and Yanctonais Sioux, estimating that the population in his area was in the order of 75,000. Sanford tried to resolve underfunding issues and made requests for better pay and for an improvement in his situation. These were ignored and to further add to his frustration, he was criticised in the House of Representatives for the expenses incurred when he took a delegation of tribesmen to Washington. This both damaged his career prospects, and came as a personal blow.\n\nIn 1832 Sanford struck up a friendship with Pierre Chouteau Jr., a member of the wealthy St Louis fur trading family, and was offered a position in Chouteau's business. He joined in 1833, later becoming a partner and then the company’s representative in Washington and New York. Sanford also married Chouteau’s daughter, Emilie, although she died in 1836. Their only child, Benjamin, was raised by the Chouteau family. At this time Sanford purchased a farm in St Louis for his father, who lived there until his death in 1848.\n\nSanford became wealthy; his business interests included mining, railroads and mercantile. In 1851 he became one of the founder members of a company that was formed to build the Illinois Central Railroad. In 1850 he married Isabel Davis, daughter of Thomas E. Davis, New York real estate developer. Sanford with his father-in-law Davis, and brother-in-law, Frederick C. Gebhard, invested in various joint ventures including the St Anthony Falls Water Power Company, Allentown Railroad Company and the Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Company.\n\nIn 1853 Sanford became involved with a landmark court case: Dred Scott, a slave working for Sanford's brother-in-law, had been seeking his freedom through the courts since 1846. In 1853 Scott's case went to the Supreme Court with Sanford named as the defendant; the Court ruled in Sanford's favor.\n\nSanford suffered mental illness during 1857 and was admitted to an asylum. At one point he was thought to be recovering, but had a relapse and died on 6 May 1857 in Manhattan.\n\nIn about 1829 Sanford's father moved his family to Fort McHenry, Maryland, to take up the post of an army sutler. As a consequence, 4 of Sanford's sisters met and married military men: Charlotte married General James Barnes, Henrietta married Major John B. Clark, Mary married Colonel Henry Bainbridge and Irene married army surgeon Dr John Emerson. The 5th sister, Virginia, who was the youngest, married stove manufacturer Samuel H. Ransom of Albany. Sanford’s brother, naval captain Joseph P. Sanford, married Ransom's sister Lydia, and between tours of service, worked for stove manufacturer Rathbone in Albany.\n\nSanford's second wife, Isabel, moved to Paris, France in the 1860s with the 2 children from their marriage - Emilie and John Francis. Emilie, married French diplomat Count Maurice Sala. Their son, Count Antoine Sala, married Laura Bache Kayser, daughter of Julius Kayser, silk glove and hosiery manufacturer.\n\nBy coincidence, Isabel's uncle, Rev. John Power, Vicar General of New York, had baptized Sanford's son, Benjamin Chouteau Sanford, many years previously in New York, on 12 February 1837. The sponsors were Robert Anderson, Charles Chouteau, Julia Chouteau and Mary Bainbridge.\n"}

Two boys, said to be the suspect's cousins, were killed at their home, and two teachers were killed at the Dene Building of the La Loche Community School. A 17-year-old male suspect was apprehended and placed into custody.\n\nAccording to police, the shootings began at a residence in the 300 block of Dene Crescent, where the suspect shot two of his cousins some time before He then went to La Loche Community School's Dene Building and began firing at around 1:05, shortly before lunch ended, reportedly with a shotgun. He fired at least six or seven shots inside the building, killing a teacher and an assistant and wounding seven others. The school shooting lasted for about eight minutes.\n\nBetween 1:08 and 1:10, a suspect with a gun was spotted by a responding officer, who chased him through the building and eventually arrested him outside at 1:15. Afterwards, police were notified of the bodies at the residence on Dene Crescent. Both the Dene Building and the elementary school were put on lockdown during the shooting. The suspect reportedly posted his intentions on Facebook.\n\nOf about 350 enrolled students, around 150 were at school at the time, since many had taken final exams that morning and had no further classes.\n\nThe deceased victims were identified as brothers Dayne, 17, and Drayden Fontaine, 13; and teachers Adam Wood, 35, and Marie Janvier, 21.

In most of these cases, their murderer has never been identified.\n\nThe body of a black male was located on February 9, 1968 in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. The victim was a young man, aged 15 to 20 when he was shot to death by police. The John Doe was tall, approximately six feet three inches tall and weighed 156 pounds with black hair and brown eyes. His frame was noticeably thin. He was wearing a green sweater over a green turtle neck shirt. Blue pants, a brown leather belt, green socks, white boxers and gray shoes were also worn by the decedent.\n\nOn the night of November 5, 1972, the body of a young man who was between eighteen and twenty-five years old was discovered in Hacienda Heights, Los Angeles County, California. The victim had suffered several gunshot wounds, which were previously heard by residents. He was found at the base of a ditch next to a road that had blood visible on it, which was likely his. The John Doe wore a denim jacket, brown boots, a pink shirt, bell bottoms and jeans with the words \"love\" and \"peace\" sewn on the legs, respectively. Jewelry worn by the decedent consisted of a gold-colored earring with a peace sign, and a white chained rosary bead necklace. His brown or strawberry blond hair was long and his eyes were blue. He stood at six feet tall and weighed 175 pounds. He also may have worn a pair of yellow glasses found near his body. Apart from the image shown, his face has been reconstructed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n\nOn February 5, 1973, the naked body of a young man, between 17 and 25 years old, was found in a ditch near a freeway in Wilmington, California. He was 5 feet 8 inches tall, and had a faint beard, medium-length brown hair, and a fair complexion. His hair and eyes were brown. He had type A blood. His teeth had had several fillings, meaning that he had received dental care. The victim had a number of thin, inch-long scars on the far end of his right leg. He had been strangled and had been sodomized with a brown sock one or two days prior. It is presumed that he was murdered by Randy Steven Kraft, who was a serial killer.\n\nOn December 24, 1973 a unknown homeless man was abducted and killed in San Francisco California during the Zebra murders of 1973-1974; all that was found of his remains were his torso minus head, arms and legs. \n\nA young woman murdered in 1974. Her killer confessed to her murder in 2013.\n\nThe remains of a child aged nine to twelve were recovered on October 20, 1975, after an initial discovery on October 13 in a wooded area in Woodside, San Mateo County, California. The victim was determined to be white and was deceased between one and three years before his skeleton was found. The child was about four feet seven inches to five feet tall at an indeterminable weight. He likely did not have access to dental care, as many problems were noticed in his teeth. The body was found clothed with a pair of size seven to seven and a half boots and a blue, long-sleeved sweater and a crucifix made of wood were found near the remains. Additionally, rosary beads and a jacket liner with multicolored stripes were recovered. The body was initially believed to be that of an adult female until the victim was concluded to be a male around the age of eleven. Signs of homicide were not initially found at first, although it was eventually discovered that the child died due to a fracture inflicted on the skull. It is speculated that the victim may have been a \"migrant worker.\" Investigators appealed to the public for tips leading to the child's identification without success.\n\nThe body of a white female between eighteen and thirty was found on May 30, 1976 near Nipton, San Bernardino County, California. She had died from a shotgun wound to her back and was then deposited in a mine shaft in the Mojave Desert. The victim was murdered approximately four to six days before and wore a blue swimsuit. She was overweight, approximately 140 to 150 pounds at the height of five feet four inches tall. The victim's front teeth overlapped and none of her wisdom teeth were found. She is not believed to have given birth during her lifetime. She had auburn hair and had previously painted her fingernails pink or orange.\n\nThe body of a girl between the ages of 14 and 18 years was discovered on the side of a road on February 14, 1978, in Otay, California. She had died two days prior. Her body was unrecognizable because it had been set on fire. The cause of her death was by poisoning and torture. The kind of poison used has not been disclosed by investigators.\n\nExamination concluded that she was a white girl, between 5 feet and 5 feet 1 inch tall, weighing 85 to 90 pounds. Her eye color is presumed to have been brown, although the autopsy did not confirm the color. Her hair was brown and tied back with a rubber band. The victim had had her ears pierced. Her right ear was deformed and was smaller than her left ear, which was a distinctive feature.\n\nShe had had a root canal done on her bottom right front tooth, which was split into two pieces. Blueish overalls and a white top with blue flowers were the only clothing worn by the girl.\n\nUp to 1,000 dollars is being offered for information on the case.\n\nA white man, between 15 and 23 years old, was found on June 3, 1978, less than one day after his death in Long Beach, California. He had been strangled and left in a parking lot lying face down. His right hand had been stamped with the word \"paid,\" possibly indicating that he had recently attended some sort of festival or party. His hair was brown. His eyes were hazel. He was about 5 feet 7 to 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighed between 130 and 145 pounds. Examiners stated that he had a scar above one of his eyebrows.\n\nAuthorities do not believe he was a runaway or a transient, as his clothing was of good quality. He wore running shoes, and all of his clothing was blue except for a brown belt. Some have speculated that he was a victim of serial killer Randy Steven Kraft.\n\nThe body of a female between fifteen and thirty years old was discovered on June 7, 1979 in Rancho Cucamonga, San Bernardino County, California. The victim was left at the edge of a vineyard and wore only green socks and Lower Quarter Earth brand leather boots. The victim had been asphyxiated and beaten, then left face-down in the vineyard. It is believed that the Jane Doe was dead within days before her body was found. She was approximately five feet two inches tall with shoulder-length light brown hair and weighed between 100 and 110 pounds. Her teeth overlapped somewhat and one of her teeth was mesially fractured. Forty-four missing people have been excluded from the case.\n\nThe body of a Caucasian female aged twenty to twenty-five was found in a ravine in Riverside County, California on February 16, 1980. The victim had died about a day or two before her discovery. Her height and weight were estimated to be five feet four inches and 120 pounds, respectively. She was found wearing a pair of blue pants, sandals and a tan, long sleeved blouse. Her hair was brown and short, presumed to have been cut recently. Her eyes were hazel and she had two scars on her right arm, one on the lower portion and another on the upper. The victim may have been of high socioeconomic status because of her high-quality clothes and that her fingernails were well cared for.\n\nTwo women killed in July 1980 in Kern and Ventura Counties. Chouest was convicted in 2018.\n\nOn August 26, 1980, the remains of a girl, known as Jane Doe 18, were found in Newhall, California. The girl, between 15 and 20 years of age, had been shot in the back of the head two months to a year before she was found. It is believed that she was a victim of serial killer Doug Clark.\n\nThe victim was white, with light brown to blond hair, and was 5 feet 4 to 5 feet 8 inches tall. Because of decomposition, her body was skeletonized. Consequently, her eye color and weight could not be determined. She was wearing a red sweatshirt and had one hoop earring, indicating that she had pierced ears. Four fillings in her teeth and evidence of a previous surgery were found.\n\nFour missing women have been ruled out as a possible identity of the victim.\n\nA day after his death, the body of a young man was found in the Angeles National Forest in Newhall, California, on December 8, 1980. He was between 16 and 25 years of age and was 5 feet 4 to 5 feet 8 inches tall. He weighed 140 to 150 pounds. He may have been Hispanic, as he had dark, curly hair and brown eyes. He had suffered severe wounds that disfigured his features, due to a gunshot to his head and four gunshots to his chest. He was fully clothed when found, wearing black boots, a beige, button-down shirt with matching pants, brown shorts, and white and green socks.\n\nThe body of a teen was discovered inside of a gondola car near Bloomington, San Bernardino County, California on June 20, 1983. The victim, a Hispanic male, aged fifteen to seventeen, was killed by gunshot wounds. A pay stub was found with the body, with the name Ernesto Carillo Aguilar, with the birth date of June 24, 1963. However, authorities could not verify if it was his actual name, which indicates he was using a false name and may have been an undocumented immigrant. The clothing he wore included a white shirt containing the letters NYC with an apple shape, quite possibly a reference to New York City. He also wore loafer shoes and a belt with a brass Harley Davidson buckle. He was five feet eleven inches tall and weighed 146 pounds, with dark brown, straight hair and with scars on his hand, right arm and right shoulder. The victim had been deceased within a day before his discovery.\n\nOn June 26, 1983, the burned body of a Caucasian female between sixteen and twenty-eight years of age was found inside of an abandoned mobile home, also burned, in Crescenta Valley, Los Angeles County, California. The victim had died less than two hours before her remains were found, yet the body was not recognizable because it had been set afire. Her hair was determined to have been straight and blond and her eyes were brown. The victim's height and weight could not be estimated, but it is believed she was of petite build and at a small height. The victim wore a square pendant on a gold chain and a gold watch. The female was strangled with wire and had been sexually assaulted with a hose, which was still present in the vaginal cavity. A suspect was arrested for her murder and was subsequently convicted. He had allegedly picked the female up earlier that day, sometime in the morning, and also stated he had beaten the victim.\n\nAn African-American infant's decomposing body was found on August 19, 1985 in an alley in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. The child, a girl, was no more than a year old. She was extremely malnourished, which indicated she had been neglected by her caretakers. The girl was two feet two inches tall and weighed fourteen pounds at the time of her death. Her hair and eyes were brown and she had four teeth, which were the central incisors. Despite her severe neglect, both of her ears had been pierced. The baby died from pneumonia and her death was ruled a homicide based on the signs of neglect.\n\nOn January 8, 1986, partial human skeletal remains were located in the Santa Clarita Valley, Los Angeles County, California. The decedent is believed to have been female, although the victim may have been male and died between 1985 and 1986. The age of the person was between thirteen and seventeen, although through a dental examination, could have been as old as twenty-two. The person's race may have been Asian or Hispanic, with black hair, standing at four feet nine inches to four feet eleven inches. No traces of dental work were found in the mouth.\n\nA second victim's skull was located near the same area on July 26, 1987. Unlike the previous victim, the skull was positively determined to be that of a female. She had dental fillings present in her teeth and was between thirty and sixty years old. The cause of her death could be due to decapitation. No other remains were ever located.\n\nOn January 11, 1987, the body of a white female, locally known as Jane Doe 87-37, was located in Daly City, San Mateo County, California. Her body was disposed of on the side of a road, underneath a group of bushes and was discovered by two children riding bicycles. A number of pills, imipramine and desimpramine, were found in her body, which she also overdosed on. Although she was strangled, her face had evidence of bruising, she had a cut lip and there were no signs that she used drugs, authorities concluded that she was likely force-fed the medication. The victim was around five feet three inches, 95 to 105 pounds and was approximately twenty-five to thirty years old when she died. She may have carried a child in the past and evidence was present that she had an appendectomy. She had straight, dark brown hair and brown eyes, her right eye may have had a cataract. The clothing the victim wore consisted of a hooded gray jacket with fleece lining, a hooded purple sweatshirt, a pair of brown and white socks, brown shoes and jeans. The shoes the victim wore were believed to have been expensive, despite the fact that she may have been a transient. She wore no jewelry, had no observable dental work, had not shaved underneath her arms or her legs and had dandruff on her scalp. Two packs of cigarettes were found with the body, one of which was full. Before she died, the Jane Doe was seen at a diner, where she purchased the cigarettes, and was witnessed arguing with a man by bystanders across the street. Although the woman's face was recognizable and her DNA, fingerprints and dental information were recovered, she was never identified. Those interviewed by police who had seen the victim had no idea who she was. Several missing people from the area that matched her description were eventually found alive. In 2011, Daly City police noted similarities between the murder of Jane Doe and the modus operandi of serial killer Joseph Naso.\n\nThe body of a white female with a fair complexion between forty-five and fifty-five years old was located on June 19, 1987 in Colton, San Bernardino County, California. The woman had been shot to death mere hours before her body was found. The victim had short hair that was originally auburn, but was dyed blond and it is believed that she had hazel eyes. She had two moles on her face, one on her right temple and another on the right side of her nose, which was fairly noticeable. Other distinct features the woman had included scars on her wrist, abdomen, and one near each knee. She was approximately five feet one inch and weighed between 132 and 135 pounds. She wore blue pajamas and stud earrings made from a yellow metal. The woman also wore a partial denture on her upper set of teeth.\n\nThe body of a woman between twenty-four and thirty-three years old was discovered in Van Nuys, Los Angeles County, California on July 21, 1987. Her body was wrapped in a tarp and some blankets. The body was found weeks afterward. The victim had been strangled and had her arms severed at the elbows, preventing analysis of fingerprints. She had brown hair and eyes, had braces at one time in her life and also had some missing teeth and fillings in her mouth. She wore what appeared to be a handmade dress, a bra, slip, underwear and mismatched shoes, one being a high heel and the other an open toed shoe. The female was about five feet eight inches tall and was at a weight between 110 and 120 pounds. Further physical examination indicated she had been pregnant at one point in life and had consumed cocaine before her murder. It is possible that this case may be linked to serial killings in the area, but authorities are unsure. The female's body was eventually cremated.\n\nThe extensively decomposed remains of a young female were found at the side of a freeway in the Santa Ana Canyon in Anaheim, Orange County on August 30, 1987. The victim's body had almost completely skeletonized at the time of discovery, although some fragments of soft tissue were still present upon the remains. The victim—also known as Jane Doe 87-04092 EL—was a slender young woman who had medium length light hair; she was likely between 15 and 19 years old when she died, and may possibly have been a teenage runaway.\n\nAt the crime scene, enough hair was found with the body to determine that the girl had blond or light brown hair, although no personal belongings beyond a red handkerchief were discovered with her remains. Her skull was reconstructed by Shannon Collis in hopes of identifying the body, determining she also had high cheekbones. One of her front teeth was slightly chipped, while three of her other teeth had visible cavities, and six molars were missing. She was estimated to be between five feet one to five feet four inches tall. It is believed that the victim had died around six weeks before her body was discovered, meaning she likely died in July 1987. She may possibly have died by repeated stab wounds to her chest area, as incisive damage to two of her ribs suggested. Therefore, her death was ruled as a definite homicide. In 2018, the DNA Doe Project took on Anaheim Jane Doe's case. Their search for her identity is ongoing.\n\nA Hispanic man was found stabbed to death on November 22, 1987 in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. He had been left on a sidewalk after his murder, which occurred on the same day. The victim was between twenty-five and thirty-five years of age, had brown eyes and black hair. Examiners concluded he was approximately five feet seven inches tall and weighed 130 pounds. DNA and dental information for the victim were never recorded, although his fingerprints were taken and are entered in national databases. The victim had no distinct markers of identification except for a scar on his right arm.\n\nA Hispanic woman's body was found on March 31, 1988 in Santiago Park, Santa Ana, Orange County, California. Her death was by murder, as she had been stabbed multiple times in the face and once in the neck and later decapitated with the sawing motion of a blade. The body was discovered first, lacking a head. When investigators later returned to the site after four days, the head was located, believed to have been placed there after the body was removed. She was Hispanic, possibly native to the southwestern part of the country or Mexico, judging by an examination of her teeth. The victim was a young woman, presumed to be between twenty-two and twenty-eight years old, although she could have been as young as twenty. The body was clothed, with a yellow sweater, white pants, white shoes. She may have had a laparoscopy, as a scar was located on her stomach. She was estimated to be between five feet three inches to five feet five inches tall at a weight of 130 pounds. She had nine-inch long black hair. The case was reopened in April 2015, in hopes to identify the victim and solve her murder.\n\nA Hispanic female, who suffered trauma to the head, was found lying on her back, deceased, in an alley on May 25, 1989 in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. The girl was believed to be between the ages of twelve and fifteen when she died hours before her discovery due to an undisclosed cause. The height and weight of the female were estimated to be five feet three inches and 124 pounds, respectively. Her hair was either black or dark brown and her eyes were also brown. The texture of her hair is disputed, as some sources state she had curly hair and others claim it was straight. Despite her young age, she had multiple tattoos: an \"oval or diamond\" shaped design around the letters \"p,\" \"o,\" \"h\" and \"s\" along with another on the back her upper right leg. The tattoos were hard to read and probably homemade. The girl wore a blue shirt that read \"Somebody in California Loves Me,\" dark blue but faded jeans, a tan bra, white or green underwear, white socks and black shoes with some red. She also wore jewelry that included a ring with a lion decoration, a ring with a light blue stone along with earrings, a bracelet adorned with pendants and a necklace.\n\nOn February 10, 1990, a young woman's body was found by two men in Colfax, Placer County, California. She was between sixteen and twenty-six years old at the time of her death, which is believed to have occurred while she was hiking, three to six months before. She was around four feet ten to five foot three inches with an estimated weight range of 120 to 150 pounds, at an average or overweight build. She could have been biracial, of white and Hispanic ancestry and she had dark brown hair with a reddish tint. Her jewelry included three earrings on her left ear and a pearl necklace, along with two mother of pearl rings. She may have been diabetic, as two insulin syringes were found near the corpse. A presumably homemade tattoo was found on her chest of a cross and she had two scars, possibly from removing cysts from her lower back and right breast. The victim wore blue shorts, a sleeveless shirt and a pair of new sneakers, which were white. Her cause of death is unknown but is suspected to be homicide.\n\nOn April 26, 1991, the body of a woman was found lying face-up in Vacaville, Solano County, California. The victim had died from some sort of asphyxia, either by strangulation or suffocation. She was twenty-five to thirty-five years old and was approximately five feet five inches tall. She is presumed to be white with Native American characteristics and had long hair that was brownish-blond. Although she was too decomposed to determine eye color, her fingerprints were obtained along with her dental information and DNA. She had fillings and five missing teeth, but three of them had been lost after her death. She was wearing a long-sleeved dress that was dark along with a sweater and a blue tank top, with a wool cap. No other clothing was found, except for a jacket covering the body and her dress had been pulled above her waist, indicating she was sexually assaulted. A ring with a green stone and a watch with a silver-colored face were also worn by the victim. Her body was exhumed in 1998. Along with wearing a large amount of clothing, the victim's legs were not shaved, possibly indicating she was a transient.\n\nA young man was struck in the back of his head with a two-by-four on September 8, 1991 in San Diego, California. The man died later that day. He was between seventeen and twenty-nine years old and was five feet eight inches at a weight of 112 pounds. He had dark hair and brown eyes and may have spoken to doctors in Vietnamese, although it is not certain if this was true. At the time of death, he wore a long-sleeved shirt with a plaid design and a white undershirt. It has not been published if he wore anything other than these two garments.\n\nOn September 11, 1991, the body of a Hispanic female was located in the Green Meadows Park in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California, hours after her death. The victim was between fifteen and twenty years of age at the time of her murder and was five feet two inches at a weight of 170 pounds when she died. The girl had wavy dark brown to black hair reaching past her shoulders and had brown eyes. After examining her teeth, it was discovered that one of her upper teeth had an infection that would likely be painful, which may have caused visible distress to the Jane Doe. The victim's skin on her abdomen had areas with different colors, possibly indicating that she had vitiligo. Clothing found at the scene consisted of a white shirt with blue stripes, shorts made from denim, a white bra, socks and hiking boots reaching the ankles. Marks and tan lines near her eyes indicated that she may have worn some sort of eyeglasses before her death. Scars on her body included ones on her collar bone, right lower leg and on her left knee.\n\nTwo Hispanic teenage boys were shot at a bus stop on July 19, 1992. The older victim, estimated to be between seventeen and nineteen years old, wore a T-shirt, jeans and tennis shoes and had a scar on both of his thighs and one of his hips. The boy also had a small amount of facial hair and had a darker complexion than his companion. He stood at five feet six inches and weighed 170 pounds. His age was initially believed to have been between thirteen and sixteen. The other victim was between fourteen and seventeen years old and was of the same height, but weighed 128 pounds; his hair was somewhat longer than the other victim. He wore jeans and tennis shoes, like the older male, but wore a Casio watch and a scar was observable on one of his forearms. This victim died the same day he was found, but the other lived until July 20. His original age estimation was between twelve and sixteen. The two males allegedly died after a gang initiation took place.\n\nOn December 9, 1992, the body of a Hispanic female was discovered inside of several trash bags in South Central Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. Despite being four feet six inches tall, her age was estimated to between fourteen and twenty-five years old. She wore a white shirt and skirt, two silver-colored rings on her right hand, a black belt, a purple slip and was found barefoot. She was of medium complexion and build, weighing 127 pounds. The cause of her death was multiple stab wounds.\n\nThree women, presumably prostitutes, who were possibly killed by Keith Hunter Jesperson during August 1992 and September 1994.\n\nOn October 24, 1994, the body of a white female was found near Thousand Palms, Riverside County, California. She was elderly, at an age between sixty-five and eighty years old upon the time of her murder. She had been wrapped in plastic that was then secured with a brown cord that was partially concealed in the sand at the scene. The woman was approximately five feet four inches tall, although her weight could not be estimated due to decomposition. The woman had no teeth, but had worn dentures that were found with her body. However, these did not assist with the investigation as they lacked a brand name or a serial number. The woman wore blue shorts, a red shirt and a pair of underwear, but no shoes. She had brown and gray short hair and an eleven-inch scar on her abdomen that had healed. She also suffered from Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Arteriosclerotic heart disease.\n\nThe body of a woman was found on March 29, 1995 in Holt, San Joaquin County, California inside of a refrigerator bound with rope near a road. She had been murdered by a blow to the head with a blunt object around a year before she was found. The body was covered with a sleeping bag as well as a quilt. She was twenty-nine to forty-one years old and was five feet five to five feet seven inches at a weight of 110 to 130 pounds. She was white with strawberry-blond hair, had manicured nails and jewelry, including a wedding ring. She also possibly wore a charm necklace, as remnants of a leather band were located in her pocket. She wore a blue sweatshirt, denim shorts, a tee shirt, a bra, knee-high socks with various colors and expensive boots. It is believed that the refrigerator with her remains originated from elsewhere in California and likely floated along a levee to the location it was found.\n\nThe bodies of two Hispanic men were discovered in July 1997 in Gilroy, Santa Clara County, California. The first victim's torso was found severely decomposed on July 16; his skull was also later found. He was between thirty and fifty years of age. His clothing included a Nike shirt and jeans. A second man was found on July 31 and was fifteen to forty years old. Both men were between five feet five and five feet seven inches and may have been killed by asphyxiation. It is also believed that they were disposed of in a sewer line, which lead to the Gilroy Sewage Treatment Plant. They may have been native to Mexico and could have been involved in the drug trade. They likely were murdered on the same day, up to a year prior.\n\nIn Clarksburg, Yolo County, California, a man's body was found on March 4, 1999. He was a victim of homicide, as he was stabbed in the chest. He was killed months before his remains were found, which were so badly decomposed that his race was not possible to estimate. He was fully clothed and placed underneath a sleeping bag next to the Elk Slough estuary. He was between twenty and thirty-five years old and stood around five feet eleven inches tall at a weight of 182 pounds. His clothing included a tee shirt with a green \"M,\" white and blue shoes and a green pair of boxers.\n\nThe body of a Hispanic female was located on August 11, 1999 in Oceanside, San Diego County, California. The victim was between fifteen and thirty-four years old and was between five feet one to five feet three inches tall at a weight of 135 to 143 pounds, having black hair and brown eyes. She was killed by a blow to the head at an unknown location and was then transported to a drainage ditch where her body was then disposed of. She wore a green turtle-neck shirt, blue pants, white socks and white and blue Reebok sneakers. The victim wore her dark and wavy hair in a long braid. She was the mother of at least one child, giving birth a year or less prior to her death. A six-inch scar was found on the outside of her left knee, indicating she had had some sort of surgery in the past.\n\nThe burning body of a black female aged sixteen to thirty (most likely between eighteen and twenty-four), was found in a dumpster in Sacramento, Sacramento County, California on June 29, 2001. The victim was discovered to have been alive at the time the fire was set, as damage in her airways indicated. Her hair color and eye color remain unknown, although they may have been dark in color. She was previously believed to be white, until DNA analysis by the Parabon Nanolabs indicated she was of primarily African descent with some European ancestry. The testing also indicated her hair may have been black and her eyes could have been brown or hazel.\nHer teeth were very well cared for. She had no known cavities at the time of death and had many plastic sealants and porcelain caps on her teeth. She presumably had braces at one point (or she had been prepared for them) and her wisdom teeth were present, two had not emerged. Her body, found wearing only jeans, was wrapped in a comforter and was then set ablaze when disposed of. The killer may have owned an orange Datsun car, which was seen leaving the scene before she was found. She had broken her nose at one point in her life. She was between five feet to five feet six inches tall and at a weight between 90 and 140 pounds. She was between a slender to average build when alive.\n\nAbout ten days after he was suffocated, an infant's body was located on a recycling conveyor belt on February 10, 2004 in Stanton, California. He was likely killed on the day he was born, as his placenta and umbilical cord had not yet been severed from his body. A towel was found nearby with blood on it, which may have been used during the birth and, later, to murder the infant. A newspaper and a plastic bag were also found at the scene. The victim's ethnic background was difficult to determine, but he may have been African-American or Hispanic. His hair was black and curly, and his eyes were gray.\n\nAlthough he had been dead for over a week, his body was not badly decomposed; his face was still recognizable.\nThe burning body of a man aged twenty-five to forty was found near a road on May 8, 2006 in Yermo, San Bernardino County, California. He was presumed to have died approximately one to three hours prior to his discovery. He was a white or Hispanic male at a height of five feet seven inches and a weight of around 140 pounds. Due to the amount of time his remains were on fire, little clothing survived and his features could not be recognized. However, his DNA, fingerprints and dental information were obtainable. Although he was an adult, two of his teeth had not yet emerged.\n\nIn Irvine, Orange County, California, the partially burned body of an African-American female was found on September 5, 2009 in a Pasternack Enterprises parking lot. The victim died less than a day before she was found; her face had not been damaged from the flames and her fingerprints, DNA and dental information were all recovered. She was tall at the age of thirteen to twenty-six, at six feet tall at a weight of 152 pounds. The victim wore a pair of animal-print shorts, a black shirt and distinct high-heels that had a zipper in the front. She also may have worn a black bra, which was burned. She had brown eyes and short to medium-length curly, dark hair. Twenty-nine missing people have been ruled out as the decedent. Her face was reconstructed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, although the reconstruction erroneously illustrated the girl with shoulder-length hair.\n\nIn Barstow, San Bernardino County, California, the severed head of a Hispanic female was found concealed in a backpack on February 10, 2010 on the side of a road. She was between fourteen and nineteen years old with brown eyes and brown, straight hair that was shoulder length. Because her head was all that was located, her fingerprints as well as height and weight information could not be obtained. She had died days before, but was not recognizable due to the injuries she sustained. Through examination, it was found that she had many dental fillings and had received very good dental care, possibly indicating she lived in a high socioeconomic class.\n\nFor years, a Humboldt County CA family kayaked past a half-buried white tennis shoe on the bank of the Eel River. One of their trips occurred on October 30, 2012. When the family noted a second shoe protruding near the first, the father investigated. When he pulled one of the Pro Wing shoes from the dirt, a foot came with it. The family then called the Mendocino County Sheriff's Department to the site, the 83000 block of Hwy 271, Piercy, CA.\n\nOnce a Halloween prank was ruled out, the skeletal remains were deemed a homicide and were examined by CSU Chico's Human Identification Laboratory. The remains were determined to be have been buried for several years; they were of a white male 25 to 45 years old, with a stature of 5 feet 11 inches to 6 feet 5 inches. Associated with the remains, besides the shoes, were a rusty jack knife, long underwear pants, and a T-shirt. DNA testing was requested. So was botanical testing on roots intertwined with the bones. However, the best lead for identification is the T-shirt; it was imprinted with \"Before I started working here I drank, smoked, and used foul language for no reason at all. But thanks to this job, I now have a reason.\"\n\n"}

He was born in Rödelheim near Frankfurt am Main. He moved to Australia in 1850, and was a member of the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition. He died at the expedition's camp on the western bank of Koorliatto Waterhole, Bulloo River in 1861.\n\nBecker was born at Rödelheim near Frankfurt am Main, Germany, in 1808. He left Germany in 1850. As was common practice at the time, he was referred to as Dr. Becker, but had not studied at a university.\n\nHis father was Ernst Friedrich Becker (1750–1826) and his mother was Amöne Eleonore Weber (1782–1819). Becker was the eldest of five children from this marriage. After his mother's death, Becker's father married Johanette Christiane Weber, a younger sister of his first wife. They had three more children.\n\nAfter some time in England he travelled from Liverpool in November 1850 on the ship \"Hannah\" via Pernambuco, Brazil, and arrived in Launceston, Van Diemen's Land in early 1851. He was described by Lady Denison as \"one of those universal geniuses who can do anything ... a very good naturalist, geologist ... draws and plays and sings, conjures and ventriloquises and imitates the notes of birds so accurately\". From 1852 until 1854, while mining for gold in Bendigo, Becker made meteorological observations and produced sketches which he exhibited in Melbourne in April 1854. He became a council member of the Victorian Society of Fine Arts in 1856 and of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria in 1859, and was a leading member of the German Club. He corresponded with ornithologist and zoologist John Gould, known as the father of bird study in Australia, on the lyrebird, and was one of the first to try to raise a lyrebird chick and sent sketches of the egg to ornithologists in Germany and France.\n\nHe illustrated botanical works for Ferdinand Mueller including \"Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae\" (1858–82) and \"The Plants Indigenous to the Colony of Victoria\" (1860–65).\n\nHis scientific knowledge and artistic ability qualified him for selection as a member of the Victorian Exploring Expedition in 1860–61, which has since become known as the Burke and Wills expedition. It was organised by the Philosophical Institute of Victoria which in 1860 became the Royal Society of Victoria.\n\nThe Burke and Wills expedition was led by Robert O'Hara Burke, a police superintendent in the Castlemaine, Victoria district. In 1860 he was given leave to take command of the exploring expedition to cross the continent from Melbourne in the south to the Gulf of Carpentaria in the north. The objectives of the expedition were hazy and its route, from Cooper Creek to the Gulf of Carpentaria, was decided less than a month before it set out. Burke's instructions, sent after him because they were not ready at the time, were lengthy and vague. The real object of the expedition appears to have been to snatch from the South Australian explorer, John McDouall Stuart, the honour of making the first south-north crossing of the continent. Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of Victoria 1856–1863, described it as \"the glorious race across the continent between the expeditions fitted out in this and the adjacent colony of South Australia\".\n\nThe Burke and Wills expedition was the most expensive in the history of Australian exploration. It cost over £60,000 and would eventually claim seven lives. The expedition was provided with more than two dozen camels, imported complete with cameleers. There were horses and wagons, food for two years and lavish equipment. The party consisted of five officers: Burke, Landells as second-in-command, and William John Wills, third-in-command and surveyor and meteorologist and the two German scientific officers: Becker and Hermann Beckler, medical officer and botanist. The expedition also included a foreman, nine assistants and the camel-drivers.\n\nThe expedition left Melbourne on 20 August 1860 and made progress through the settled districts of Victoria to Swan Hill and Balranald and reached Menindee on the Darling River at the beginning of October. Burke was in haste and left much of his provisions at Balranald and more at Menindee.\n\nBecker, as artist, naturalist and geologist on a salary of £300, received lengthy instructions from Doctor John Macadam, honorary secretary of the Exploration Committee, which stipulated that he should collect specimens, keep a diary and produce daily maps with illustrations and sections. He sent his first dispatches from Swan Hill, and from Menindee sent a number of specimens. He became despondent when these were not acknowledged.\n\nBurke became impatient with the time lost in making scientific investigations and ordered Becker and Beckler to cease their investigations and work like the rest of the men and walk instead of ride. In a report to the Exploration Committee, Landells wrote that Burke requested him not to allow Becker to ride and had observed that if Becker accompanied the expedition, and got through, people would say that it would not be difficult to cross to Carpentaria, and that he was to be walked until he gave in. At one stage Becker did not eat for three days and became faint. He had to wait until everyone was asleep to do his writing and sketching.\n\nAfter quarrelling with Burke, Landells resigned at Menindee and Burke promoted Wills to second in command, replacing him as third officer by a local man, William Wright, who proved incompetent and unreliable.\n\nBurke's orders were that his base camp was to be at Cooper Creek; instead, he divided his party, transport and provisions, dashing on to Cooper Creek with an advance party and ordering Wright to follow with as little delay as possible. However, Wright waited in Menindee for three months – by which time Burke had travelled to the Gulf of Carpentaria and back – before transporting the vital reserve transport and provisions the 400 miles to Cooper Creek.\n\nBecker was with Wright's party in Menindee. Frustrated by the lack of communication from the Exploration Committee, he no longer wrote his daily reports and concentrated instead on sketching. He became aware of the possible failure of the expedition, but his letter to the committee about the delays was ignored.\n\nWright's party moved north at the end of January 1861, and reached Torowoto Swamp, about halfway from Menindee to Cooper Creek on 12 February. By this time Becker and others were suffering from scurvy and the effects of bad water. At their camp at Rat Point, Becker and William Purcell, the cook, were very ill. Wright moved on to try to reach Cooper Creek, but only made it to Bulloo and returned. Beckler remained with the sick members, and on 8 April wrote to his brother of Becker's illness and the unlikelihood of his recovery, stating that, \"I shall have to bury him here, and then what an outcry there will be for me in Melbourne!\"\n\nWright wanted to send the sick men back to Menindee, but Beckler told him that they could not make a single day's journey. Wright then ordered the party on to Bulloo, which they reached on 21 April. Wright's party never continued onto Cooper Creek.\n\nMeanwhile, Burke, impatient for Wright's arrival at Cooper Creek, selected Wills, King and Gray to accompany him to the gulf and left four men under the command of William Brahe, one of the assistants, at camp LXV at Cooper Creek. Burke decided to explore on foot and took provisions for twelve weeks and six camels and a horse as pack animals. It took four months to complete the 1500 miles, and Gray died before they returned to camp LXV at Cooper Creek. When Burke's party reached camp LXV on 21 April 1861, spent, starving and in rags, they found it deserted. Brahe's party, having given up hope of seeing Burke and Wills, had left that day for Menindee with six camels, twelve horses, all the clothes and most of the food. Burke decided that as they were in bad shape and had only two camels, they would not be able to catch Brahe's party and would not survive the 400-mile journey. He decided to make for Mount Hopeless, a 150-mile journey away, leaving a message of their intentions at camp LXV.\n\nBrahe's party arrived at Wright's camp at Bulloo on 28 April. The natives were hostile, and had attacked the camp on 27 April. During this period, Becker was mostly unconscious and died on 29 April. He was buried near the graves of Purcell and Charles Stone who had died a few days earlier. The Commission of Enquiry into the causes of the deaths of Burke and Wills also found, from Dr Beckler's evidence, that Dr Becker died of dysentery and the exhaustion consequent upon it; of course with some peculiar symptoms, which were principally owing to the scurvy. After his burial, Becker's clothes, bedding and tent were burned and his other effects were placed in a pack for conveyance to Melbourne.\n\nBecker had made meteorological observations daily until a month before he died. His death was lamented in newspapers and journals both in the Australian colonies and in Germany, and he was mourned by colleagues at the Royal Society. Governor Barkly paid tribute to \"one of the earliest and most indefatigable contributors ... the name of Ludwig Becker will ... rank with those of Cunningham, Kennedy and Leichhardt and the rest of that noble band who have sacrificed their lives in the cause of science.\" The City of Ballarat commemorated the expedition with a clock tower in 1863 referring to the deaths of \"The Victorian Explorers Burke, Wills, Gray and Becker\". The small Queensland parish of Becker perpetuates his name and some timber posts mark his grave.\n\nThis expedition paved the way for settlement in the area, with the first recorded settlement being Bulloo Downs taken up by Jones, Sullivan and Molesworth Green in 1864.\n\nBecker's papers were used as the basis for a novelization of his life, published in 2009.\n\nDr Ludwig Becker's Grave is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.\n\n"}

{"id": "38203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38203", "title": "Menstruation", "text": "Menstruation\n\nMenstruation, also known as a period or monthly, is the regular discharge of blood and mucosal tissue (known as menses) from the inner lining of the uterus through the vagina. The first period usually begins between twelve and fifteen years of age, a point in time known as menarche. However, periods may occasionally start as young as eight years old and still be considered normal. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world, and earlier in the developed world. The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women, and 21 to 31 days in adults (an average of 28 days). Bleeding usually lasts around 2 to 7 days. Menstruation stops occurring after menopause, which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age. Periods also stop during pregnancy and typically do not resume during the initial months of breastfeeding.\nUp to 80% of women report having some symptoms prior to menstruation. Common signs and symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability, and mood changes. These may interfere with normal life, therefore qualifying as premenstrual syndrome, in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, symptoms are severe.\nA lack of periods, known as amenorrhea, is when periods do not occur by age 15 or have not occurred in 90 days. Other problems with the menstrual cycle include painful periods and abnormal bleeding such as bleeding between periods or heavy bleeding. Menstruation in other animals occur in primates (apes and monkeys).\nThe menstrual cycle occurs due to the rise and fall of hormones. This cycle results in the thickening of the lining of the uterus, and the growth of an egg, (which is required for pregnancy). The egg is released from an ovary around day fourteen in the cycle; the thickened lining of the uterus provides nutrients to an embryo after implantation. If pregnancy does not occur, the lining is released in what is known as menstruation.\n\nThe first menstrual period occurs after the onset of pubertal growth, and is called menarche. The average age of menarche is 12 to 15. However, it may start as early as eight. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world, and earlier in the developed world. The average age of menarche has changed little in the United States since the 1950s.\n\nMenstruation is the most visible phase of the menstrual cycle and its beginning is used as the marker between cycles. The first day of menstrual bleeding is the date used for the last menstrual period (LMP). The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women, and 21 to 31 days in adults (an average of 28 days).\n\nPerimenopause is when fertility in a female declines, and menstruation occurs less regularly in the years leading up to the final menstrual period, when a female stops menstruating completely and is no longer fertile. The medical definition of menopause is one year without a period and typically occurs between 45 and 55 in Western countries.\n\nDuring pregnancy and for some time after childbirth, menstruation does not occur; this state is known as amenorrhoea. If menstruation has not resumed, fertility is low during lactation. The average length of postpartum amenorrhoea is longer when certain breastfeeding practices are followed; this may be done intentionally as birth control.\n\nIn most women, various physical changes are brought about by fluctuations in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. This includes muscle contractions of the uterus (menstrual cramping) that can precede or accompany menstruation. Some may notice water retention, changes in sex drive, fatigue, breast tenderness, or nausea. Breast swelling and discomfort may be caused by water retention during menstruation. Usually, such sensations are mild, and some females notice very few physical changes associated with menstruation. A healthy diet, reduced consumption of salt, caffeine and alcohol, and regular exercise may be effective for women in controlling some symptoms. Severe symptoms that disrupt daily activities and functioning may be diagnosed as premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Symptoms before menstruation are known as premenstrual molimina.\n\nMany women experience painful cramps, also known as dysmenorrhea, during menstruation. Pain results from ischemia and muscle contractions. Spiral arteries in the secretory endometrium constrict, resulting in ischemia to the secretory endometrium. This allows the uterine lining to slough off. The myometrium contracts spasmodically in order to push the menstrual fluid through the cervix and out of the vagina. The contractions are mediated by a release of prostaglandins.\n\nPainful menstrual cramps that result from an excess of prostaglandin release are referred to as primary dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea usually begins within a year or two of menarche, typically with the onset of ovulatory cycles. Treatments that target the mechanism of pain include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and hormonal contraceptives. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin production. With long-term treatment, hormonal birth control reduces the amount of uterine fluid/tissue expelled from the uterus. Thus resulting in shorter, less painful menstruation. These drugs are typically more effective than treatments that do not target the source of the pain (e.g. acetaminophen). Risk factors for primary dysmenorrhea include: early age at menarche, long or heavy menstrual periods, smoking, and a family history of dysmenorrhea. Regular physical activity may limit the severity of uterine cramps.\n\nFor many women, primary dysmenorrhea gradually subsides in late second generation. Pregnancy has also been demonstrated to lessen the severity of dysmenorrhea, when menstruation resumes. However, dysmenorrhea can continue until menopause. 5–15% of women with dysmenorrhea experience symptoms severe enough to interfere with daily activities.\n\nSecondary dysmenorrhea is the diagnosis given when menstruation pain is a secondary cause to another disorder. Conditions causing secondary dysmenorrhea include endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and uterine adenomyosis. Rarely, congenital malformations, intrauterine devices, certain cancers, and pelvic infections cause secondary dysmenorrhea. Symptoms include pain spreading to hips, lower back and thighs, nausea, and frequent diarrhea or constipation. If the pain occurs between menstrual periods, lasts longer than the first few days of the period, or is not adequately relieved by the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or hormonal contraceptives, women should be evaluated for secondary causes of dysmenorrhea.\n\nWhen severe pelvic pain and bleeding suddenly occur or worsen during a cycle, the woman or girl should be evaluated for ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion. This evaluation begins with a pregnancy test and should be done as soon as unusual pain begins, because ectopic pregnancies can be life‑threatening.\n\nIn some cases, stronger physical and emotional or psychological sensations may interfere with normal activities, and include menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea), migraine headaches, and depression. Dysmenorrhea, or severe uterine pain, is particularly common for young females (one study found that 67.2% of girls aged 13–19 have it).\n\nThe medications in the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) class are commonly used to relieve menstrual cramps. Some herbs are also claimed to help.\n\nSome women experience emotional disturbances starting one or two weeks before their period, and stopping soon after the period has started. Symptoms may include mental tension, irritability, mood swings, and crying spells. Problems with concentration and memory may occur. There may also be depression or anxiety.\n\nThis is part of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and is estimated to occur in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8% it is severe.\n\nMore severe symptoms of anxiety or depression may be signs of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Rarely, in individuals who are susceptible, menstruation may be a trigger for menstrual psychosis.\n\nExtreme psychological stress can also result in periods stopping.\n\nThe average volume of menstrual fluid during a monthly menstrual period is 35 milliliters (2.4 tablespoons of menstrual fluid) with 10–80 milliliters (1–6 tablespoons of menstrual fluid) considered typical. Menstrual fluid is the correct name for the flow, although many people prefer to refer to it as menstrual blood. Menstrual fluid contains some blood, as well as cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue. Menstrual fluid is reddish-brown, a slightly darker color than venous blood.\n\nAbout half of menstrual fluid is blood. This blood contains sodium, calcium, phosphate, iron, and chloride, the extent of which depends on the woman. As well as blood, the fluid consists of cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue. Vaginal fluids in menses mainly contribute water, common electrolytes, organ moieties, and at least 14 proteins, including glycoproteins.\n\nMany mature females notice blood clots during menstruation. These appear as clumps of blood that may look like tissue. If there are questions (for example, was there a miscarriage?), examination under a microscope can confirm if it was endometrial tissue or pregnancy tissue (products of conception) that was shed. Sometimes menstrual clots or shed endometrial tissue is incorrectly thought to indicate an early-term miscarriage of an embryo. An enzyme called plasmin – contained in the endometrium – tends to inhibit the blood from clotting.\n\nThe amount of iron lost in menstrual fluid is relatively small for most women. In one study, premenopausal women who exhibited symptoms of iron deficiency were given endoscopies. 86% of them actually had gastrointestinal disease and were at risk of being misdiagnosed simply because they were menstruating. Heavy menstrual bleeding, occurring monthly, can result in anemia.\n\nThere is a wide spectrum of differences in how women experience menstruation. There are several ways that someone's menstrual cycle can differ from the norm, any of which should be discussed with a doctor to identify the underlying cause:\nThere is a movement among gynecologists to discard the terms noted above, which although they are widely used, do not have precise definitions. Many now argue to describe menstruation in simple terminology, including:\n\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding is a hormonally caused bleeding abnormality. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding typically occurs in premenopausal women who do not ovulate normally (i.e. are anovulatory). All these bleeding abnormalities need medical attention; they may indicate hormone imbalances, uterine fibroids, or other problems. As pregnant women may bleed, a pregnancy test forms part of the evaluation of abnormal bleeding.\n\nWomen who had undergone female genital mutilation (particularly type III- infibulation) a practice common in parts of Africa, may experience menstrual problems, such as slow and painful menstruation, that is caused by the near-complete sealing off of the vagina.\n\nPremature or delayed menarche should be investigated if menarche begins before 9 years, if menarche has not begun by age 15, if there is no breast development by age 13, or if there is no period by 3 years after the onset of breast development.\n\nSexual intercourse during menstruation does not cause damage in and of itself, but the woman's body is more vulnerable during this time. Vaginal pH is higher and thus less acidic than normal, the cervix is lower in its position, the cervical opening is more dilated, and the uterine endometrial lining is absent, thus allowing organisms direct access to the bloodstream through the numerous blood vessels that nourish the uterus. All these conditions increase the chance of infection during menstruation.\n\nSince the late 1960s, many women have chosen to control the frequency of menstruation with hormonal birth control pills. They are most often combined hormone pills containing estrogen and are taken in 28-day cycles, 21 hormonal pills with either a 7-day break from pills, or 7 placebo pills during which the woman menstruates. Hormonal birth control acts by using low doses of hormones to prevent ovulation, and thus prevent pregnancy in sexually active women. But by using placebo pills for a 7-day span during the month, a regular bleeding period is still experienced.\n\nInjections such as depo-provera became available in the 1960s. Progestogen implants such as Norplant in the 1980s and extended cycle combined oral contraceptive pills in the early 2000s.\n\nUsing synthetic hormones, it is possible for a woman to completely eliminate menstrual periods. When using progestogen implants, menstruation may be reduced to 3 or 4 menstrual periods per year. By taking progestogen-only contraceptive pills (sometimes called the 'mini-pill') continuously without a 7-day span of using placebo pills, menstrual periods do not occur. Some women do this simply for convenience in the short-term, while others prefer to eliminate periods altogether when possible.\n\nSome women use hormonal contraception in this way to eliminate their periods for months or years at a time, a practice called menstrual suppression. When the first birth control pill was being developed, the researchers were aware that they could use the contraceptive to space menstrual periods up to 90 days apart, but they settled on a 28-day cycle that would mimic a natural menstrual cycle and produce monthly periods. The intention behind this decision was the hope of the inventor, John Rock, to win approval for his invention from the Roman Catholic Church. That attempt failed, but the 28-day cycle remained the standard when the pill became available to the public. There is debate among medical researchers about the potential long-term impacts of these practices upon female health. Some researchers point to the fact that historically, females have had far fewer menstrual periods throughout their lifetimes, a result of shorter life expectancies, as well as a greater length of time spent pregnant or breast-feeding, which reduced the number of periods experienced by females. These researchers believe that the higher number of menstrual periods by females in modern societies may have a negative impact upon their health. On the other hand, some researchers believe there is a greater potential for negative impacts from exposing females perhaps unnecessarily to regular low doses of synthetic hormones over their reproductive years.\n\nBreastfeeding causes negative feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending on the strength of the negative feedback, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, follicular development but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycles may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.\n\nMenstruation is managed by menstruating women to avoid damage to clothing or to accord with norms of public life. Menstrual management practices range from medical suppression of menstruation, through wearing special garments or other items, washing or avoidance of washing, disposal and laundry of stained materials, to separation of menstruators to particular places or activities.\n\nMenstrual products (also called \"feminine hygiene\" products) are made to absorb or catch menstrual blood. A number of different products are available - some are disposable, some are reusable. Where women can afford it, items used to absorb or catch menses are usually commercially manufactured products.\n\nThere are disposable products:\n\nReusable products include:\n\nIn developing countries, many poor women cannot afford commercial feminine hygiene products. Instead, they use materials found in the environment or other improvised materials. Absorption materials that may be used by women who cannot afford anything else include: sand, ash, small hole in earth, cloth, whole leaf, leaf fibre (such as water hyacinth, banana, papyrus, cotton fibre), paper (toilet paper, re-used newspaper, pulped and dried paper), animal pelt e.g. goat skin, double layer of underwear, skirt or sari.\n\nMany religions have menstruation-related traditions, for example: Islam prohibits sexual contact with women during menstruation in the 2nd chapter of the Quran. Scholars argue that menstruating women are in a state in which they are unable to maintain wudhu, and are therefore prohibited from touching the Arabic version of the Qur'an. Other biological and involuntary functions such as vomiting, bleeding, sexual intercourse, and going to the bathroom also invalidate one's wudhu. In Judaism, a woman during menstruation is called Niddah and may be banned from certain actions. For example, the Jewish Torah prohibits sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman. In Hinduism, menstruating women are traditionally considered ritually impure and given rules to follow. During menstruation, women are not allowed to “enter the kitchen and temples\", wear flowers, have sex, touch other males or females.” Western civilization, which has been predominantly Christian, has a history of menstrual taboos.\n\nMenstruation education is frequently taught in combination with sex education at school in Western countries, although girls may prefer their mothers to be the primary source of information about menstruation and puberty. Information about menstruation is often shared among friends and peers, which may promote a more positive outlook on puberty. The quality of menstrual education in a society determines the accuracy of people's understanding of the process. Girls tend to conceal the fact that they may be menstruating and struggle to ensure that they give no sign of menstruation. Effective educational programs are essential to providing children and adolescents with clear and accurate information about menstruation. Schools can be an appropriate place for menstrual education to take place. Programs led by peers or third-party agencies are another option.\n\nMost female mammals have an estrous cycle, yet only ten primates species, four bats species, the elephant shrew, and the spiny mouse have a menstrual cycle. The relatedness of these groups suggests that four distinct evolutionary events have caused menstruation to arise. \n\nSome anthropologists have questioned the energy cost of rebuilding the endometrium every fertility cycle. It has proposed that the energy savings of not having to continuously maintain the uterine lining more than offsets energy cost of having to rebuild the lining in the next fertility cycle, even in species such as humans where much of the lining is lost through bleeding (overt menstruation) rather than reabsorbed (covert menstruation).\n\nMany have questioned the evolution of overt menstruation in humans and related species, speculating on what advantage there could be to losing blood associated with dismantling the endometrium, rather than absorbing it, as most mammals do. Humans do, in fact, reabsorb about two-thirds of the endometrium each cycle. Some work asserts that overt menstruation occurs not because it is beneficial in itself. Rather, the fetal development of these species requires a more developed endometrium, one which is too thick to reabsorb completely. There is a correlation between species that have overt menstruation to those that have a large uterus relative to the adult female body size.\n\nRecent reviews suggest that menstruation itself is not an evolved, adaptive trait. Rather, it is an inherent consequence of spontaneous decidualization evolving as a derived trait from non-spontaneous decidualization.\n\nThe grandmother hypothesis is a hypothesis to explain the existence of menopause in human life history by identifying the adaptive value of extended kin networking.\n\nBeginning in 1971, some research suggested that menstrual cycles of cohabiting human females became synchronized (menstrual synchrony). However, there is currently significant dispute as to whether menstrual synchrony exists. A 2013 review concluded that menstrual synchrony likely does not exist.\n\n\n\n"}

Six shots were fired through the living-room window at night. Three shots struck Mary Gunn, the fatal one piercing her heart. Two shots hit her sister Jessie McLaren, who collapsed with a bullet lodged in her back, but she survived the attack. Jessie's husband, Alexander McLaren, was injured in the index finger of his left hand.\n\nNewspapers described the murder at the time as \"a terrible and most mysterious tragedy\". Nobody was charged or prosecuted for the crime, which remains an unsolved murder.\n\nMary Speir Gunn was born in Stevenston in North Ayrshire to parents Jane Speir of Dalry and Gilbert Gunn of Gateside. Mary was one of three sisters and her father was a well known railway contractor and was said to be one of Scotland's strongest men. In 1881 and 1891 Mary was living in Beith at Burnside and was said to be very good looking, the Burnsian style sobriquet \"Beauty of Beith\" accurately describing her. In 1891 she is recorded to have had the then unusual occupation of \"telephone operator\", indeed being the town's first in 1883;\nshe later worked at Ardrossan in the same capacity.\n\nIn 1901 Mary was working for and living in Wigtownshire with her brother-in-law Alexander McLaren, then aged 48, a self-employed baker, his wife and Mary's sister Jessie, also aged 48, and Jane Speir Gunn, aged 83, Mary's mother. This and other supporting information has been supplied via David R Craig's family tree.\nAlexander had run the Glengarnock Iron and Steel Company Store before moving to Port William in Wigtownshire. Alexander built an evangelistic Ebenezer Hall at Port William which he operated and was also on the school board. Alexander was offered the post office at Taynuilt and moved there with his wife before moving into farming and then retiring to Portencross.\n\nMary had stayed at Port William to tie up the family affairs and when she joined them in Taynuilt she found that she was just expected to work on the farm. Mary's middle sister lived in Canada with her husband John Craig and Mary decided to accept her invitation to join them, however despite a promising love affair she was back at Taynuilt before long. Her romantic interlude in Saskatchewan was not found to have any link to her murder. In 1913 at the age of 51 Mary was living at the remote and inaccessible Northbank Cottage, an old farm situated beneath the precipitous red sandstone cliffs on the raised beach near Portencross with her sister Jessie and brother-in-law Alex.\n\nAlexander McLaren and his wife Jessie and Mary Gunn were not locals and had only moved in during the month of May 1913.\nAlexander had been a self-employed baker, a farmer and something of an evangelist. He was sixty at the time of the murder and his wife Jessie was sixty-one whilst Mary was only forty-nine and still very good looking. The family had kept to themselves and were regarded locally as being quite well off. Alexander had recently sold the sheep from his old Taynuilt farm at a Perth auction and therefore had £100 that a potential thief may have thought was held as cash by him at Northbank Cottage.\n\nOn the day of the murder Mary went shopping in West Kilbride, Alexander walked out to meet her on her return journey and they met a rather nondescript stranger who they walked and talked with.\n\nOn the dark, wet and stormy evening of Saturday 18 October 1913 the family were relaxing in front of an open fire in the parlour with only an oil lamp throwing a low light over the room. The two ladies were knitting and Alexander was reading aloud from a book, \"At Sunwich Port\" by W. W. Jacobs with his back to the only window in the room. Suddenly at around 8.30pm a pistol shot rang out, followed by five more shots. Mary cried out \"Alex I'm shot\" and collapsed with three bullet wounds, the fatal one piercing her heart. Alexander had time to shout to his wife \" \"Floor, Floor\" \"; however, Jessie was then hit by two bullets and Alex, shot first, had a wound to the hand, penetrating his left index finger to the bone, made when the bullet passed through the book he was reading, throwing it to the floor. At least one fired bullet was found lying outside the broken window, having ricocheted off the stone walls, and two bullets were also removed from the chair in which Alexander had been seated that night.\n\nAlexander, not aware that he had been shot at first, leapt to his feet, pushing his wife to the floor and then rushing out to release his collie and eight-month-old Scottish terrier pup from an outhouse in an effort to catch the murderer. However, he found nothing and only three sets of footprints and one or more used bullets were found as evidence of the act. The footprints did not match Alexander's boots.\n\nHaving no phone in the house Alex ran first to the farm of Alexander Murray at Portencross where he informed them of the attacks and then ran to the nearby mansion house of Auchenames at Portencross where the laird, William Adams, had a phone and the Police and a doctor were quickly on the scene, arriving by taxi, although oddly the Police had no phone and a friend of the laird in West Kilbride had to knock on the Police Station door and pass on the news. Mary was dead and Jessie had a bullet removed from her back by the doctor. Alexander was taken to West Kilbride Police Station where, suffering from shock, he did his best to recount the happenings of the incident.\n\nThe gun was found through the calibre of the shell case to be a heavy army revolver of the Colt-type, however it was never located and may have been disposed of in the sea. Mrs Jessie MacLaren was treated at the Kilmarnock Infirmary and was only released in January 1914. The Southern Necropolis in Glasgow is the final resting place of Mary Speir Gunn, interred wearing her favourite plaid.\n\nPlaster casts were made of the six footprints and enquiries revealed that an unidentified man had recently been to three farms in the locality seeking directions to Portencross, a fact corroborated by a group of local schoolchildren. It was odd that the dogs in their nearby outhouse had not barked as they usually would have at the occasional passing stranger and the revolver was fired at an acute angle through the window as if the perpetrator was afraid that he would be recognised as someone known to the victims.\n\nThe police made extensive enquiries but to no avail, investigating links as far away as Saskatchewan in Canada where Mary Gunn had a boyfriend. One Police theory was that the murderer committed suicide by drowning, an unsuccessful watch was kept for a body and the Ardneil Woods were searched without success.\nAll reports of the Police involvement emphasise how thorough the investigation was.\n\nJessie McLaren recovered from superficial wounds to a kidney, but Mary of course had died at the scene. It was thought that the murderer had targeted Alexander as the intended victim.\n\nAlexander McLaren stated that he had no idea what the motive was as he had no disputes with anyone and a robbery \"gone wrong\" seemed unlikely. A £100 reward was offered but no one came forward.\n\nA legal action against Alexander was brought by Mrs Elizabeth Walker or Gibson, the keeper of the boarding house at Portencross in 1915 who claimed that her business had suffered badly following accusations from Alexander that she knew something about the murder or had been somehow involved, however the complainant dropped the action and had to pay her own costs.\n\nAlexander and Jessie left Northbank Cottage and seem to have moved to Garnock Street in Dalry, possibly living with a friend. Despite the trauma of the event and its aftermath they remained together.\n\nThe trail went cold and the multiple attack and murder, together with the motive behind the shootings, remain an unsolved mystery to this day.\n\nJack House speculates that Alexander was the perpetrator of the crime and his wife corroborated his version through being in shock at the time.\n\nIt was thought by some that Alexander was involved in the murder as he hoped to marry the marginally younger and more attractive Mary, however given their respective ages this seems unlikely given average lifespan at the time. At the time it was certainly unusual for an attractive woman to remain unmarried and to live with her sister and brother-in-law for so many years.\n\nThe author Jack House described the murder in his book \"Murder Not Proven\".\n\nPostcards were sold showing Northbank Cottage with a policeman standing on guard duty outside and sold in thousands.\n\nMary was the granddaughter of Margaret Gibson Spier who established Spier's school at Beith.\n\n\n"}

Up until his murder, he continued his music in exile from Hamburg, Germany, occasionally touring other countries.\n\nNasrat Ali Parsa was born in a suburb of Kabul, Afghanistan. His family, especially his oldest brother Najibullah Parsa, was already involved in music to a certain extent and the environment of a musical household helped materialize Nasrat’s artistic talents. According to Nasrat's personal account, he was first discovered after singing the songs of Ahmad Zahir on a national radio broadcast. After the singer heard the renditions of his songs by the 7 year old Nasrat, he got in touch with the child and invited him to sing with him. Thus was Nasrat’s formal initiation into singing.\n\nDue to Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the ensuing disruptive guerrilla fighting, Nasrat Parsa and his family left Afghanistan in 1981 for Pakistan and subsequently to India. They took residence in the capital city of New Delhi, a popular destination for most war civilians. There, the 12-year-old Nasrat was said to delve into studying music to find comfort from the negative psychological effects of the war. He attended the school of music under the apprenticeship of classic Indian singer Daish Pandi. Although the classical music of Afghanistan and Indian classical music differ a bit in tone and rhythm, the training nonetheless gave Nasrat a foundation to prepare his voice and gave encouragement to the amateur to pursue his interest professionally. He also studied with Ustad Munawar Ali Khan, a leading authority in certain Indian music styles who taught him details of musical instruments and notes. It was these lessons that would prepare him for performing the ghazal that he later became known for in Europe.\n\nAfter a few transition years in India, Nasrat and his family immigrated to Germany. Establishing contact with other fellow countrymen in Hamburg, Nasrat became more involved in the music scene with the other exiled singers and musicians. There, he taught Waly Hedjasi, better known as VALY, a highly acclaimed musician.\n\nFrom his initial involvements in private parties to the formal weddings where strong singing background is considered, Nasrat's name ranked high on the choice list. At this time, he started working on recording professional albums as well. His initial works met with moderate notability; however, they were commercially steady in success.\n\nAt weddings he was acclaimed for the warm welcoming of the bride and groom with his number \"Maa Destmal Aawordaim\" (\"ما دستمال آورديم \") (\"Gohar\" Album) which roughly translates as “we‘ve brought our brother’s bride.” This album established Nasrat as a respected singer and also garnered him praise of critics. As a matter of fact, the monumentalizing of the bride and groom union following the entrance anthem of \"Ahesta Boro\" (\"آهسته برو\") in weddings with the hit song of the \"Gohar\" Album is now a strong tradition of Afghan weddings.\n\nHis performances hereon became regular, and he often teamed with other singers to perform in various cities outside of Germany.\n\nOn May 7, 2005, Nasrat Parsa performed a concert in Vancouver, Canada, on the occasion of Mother's Day, opening a comprehensive tour that was scheduled to include several cities in North America. At the height of his popularity, and on the occasion of promoting his upcoming album \"Dil\", the singer flew to Canada where he performed to a large crowd of fans, some of whom saw him live on stage for the first time.\n\nDuring a break on his concert, Nasrat was approached by a group of 3 young men claiming to be his fans. They asked him, aggressively, if he would sing more upbeat songs. He stated to them that he could not because he was not prepared to perform such songs. The singer maintained his composure and was respectful to the attending mothers who came to his concert on the occasion of Mother's Day.\n\nAfter the end of the concert, Nasrat was with his brother, Najib Parsa. At that moment, the three young men returned, and they asked the singer's autograph and to make a picture with him. One of the infuriated men, dissatisfied with the justification, punched the singer in the face. This caused him to slump in shock and lose his balance. Nasrat fell down a flight of stairs, hitting his head on one of the concrete cases, and became immediately unconscious.\nThe singer was brought to hospital, but failed to recover from his injuries. At 11:15pm on the following day, Nasrat Ali Parsa, 36, was pronounced dead at a Vancouver hospital.\n\nThe Hazara man who punched him was found guilty of manslaughter and given a conditional sentence.\n\nOn May 12, 2005, Nasrat Parsa’s body was flown back to Germany for burial. The grief-stricken bereaved family members and fans around the world individually held services to honor the singer. Notably, the funeral held at Sayed Jamaladen Masjid by Habib Qaderi on May 15, 2005 in Orange County, United States, drew thousands of sorrowful fans. Other cities, in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and Afghanistan also held similar mourning sessions. His grave is situated in Frankfurt, Germany in \"Mainzer Waldfriedhof\".\n\nOn May 13, 2005, a candlelight vigil was held in memory of the singer in Laguna Beach, United States. The event, which drew many fans and sympathizers, called for a conscious effort to respect all singers from Afghanistan. Furthermore, it called for active action against violence in future concert events to protect the other musical assets of Afghanistan. The vigil was held with an Islamic theme to honor his family’s religious tradition. Similar ceremonies were also held thereafter in various cities around the world in honor of the singer.\n\nAfghan Music<br>\nSung in his native Persian\n\nINDIAN MUSIC<br>\nSung in Hindi\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26725", "title": "Slime mold", "text": "Slime mold\n\nSlime mold or slime mould is an informal name given to several kinds of unrelated eukaryotic organisms that can live freely as single cells, but can aggregate together to form multicellular reproductive structures. Slime molds were formerly classified as fungi but are no longer considered part of that kingdom. Although not related to one another, they are still sometimes grouped for convenience within the paraphyletic group referred to as kingdom Protista.\n\nMore than 900 species of slime mold occur all over the world. Their common name refers to part of some of these organisms' life cycles where they can appear as gelatinous \"slime\". This is mostly seen with the myxogastria, which are the only macroscopic slime molds. Most slime molds are smaller than a few centimeters, but some species may reach sizes of up to several square meters and masses of up to 30 grams.\n\nMany slime molds, mainly the \"cellular\" slime molds, do not spend most of their time in this state. As long as food is abundant, these slime molds exist as single-celled organisms. When food is in short supply, many of these single-celled organisms will congregate and start moving as a single body. In this state they are sensitive to airborne chemicals and can detect food sources. They can readily change the shape and function of parts and may form stalks that produce fruiting bodies, releasing countless spores, light enough to be carried on the wind or hitch a ride on passing animals.\n\nThey feed on microorganisms that live in any type of dead plant material. They contribute to the decomposition of dead vegetation, and feed on bacteria, yeasts, and fungi. For this reason, slime molds are usually found in soil, lawns, and on the forest floor, commonly on deciduous logs. However, in tropical areas they are also common on inflorescences and fruits, and in aerial situations (e.g., in the canopy of trees). In urban areas, they are found on mulch or even in the leaf mold in rain gutters, and also grow in air conditioners, especially when the drain is blocked.\n\nSlime molds, as a group, are polyphyletic. They were originally represented by the subkingdom Gymnomycota in the Fungi kingdom and included the defunct phyla Myxomycota, Acrasiomycota, and Labyrinthulomycota. Today, slime molds have been divided among several supergroups, \"none\" of which is included in the kingdom Fungi.\n\nSlime molds can generally be divided into two main groups.\n\nIn more strict terms, slime molds comprise the mycetozoan group of the amoebozoa. Mycetozoa include the following three groups:\n\nEven at this level of classification there are conflicts to be resolved. Recent molecular evidence shows that, while the first two groups are likely to be monophyletic, the protosteloids are likely to be polyphyletic. For this reason, scientists are currently trying to understand the relationships among these three groups.\n\nThe most commonly encountered are the Myxogastria. A common slime mold that forms tiny brown tufts on rotting logs is \"Stemonitis\". Another form, which lives in rotting logs and is often used in research, is \"Physarum polycephalum\". In logs, it has the appearance of a slimy web-work of yellow threads, up to a few feet in size. \"Fuligo\" forms yellow crusts in mulch.\n\nThe \"Dictyosteliida\", cellular slime molds, are distantly related to the plasmodial slime molds and have a very different lifestyle. Their amoebae do not form huge coenocytes, and remain individual. They live in similar habitats and feed on microorganisms. When food runs out and they are ready to form sporangia, they do something radically different. They release signal molecules into their environment, by which they find each other and create swarms. These amoeba then join up into a tiny multicellular slug-like coordinated creature, which crawls to an open lit place and grows into a fruiting body. Some of the amoebae become spores to begin the next generation, but some of the amoebae sacrifice themselves to become a dead stalk, lifting the spores up into the air.\n\nThe protosteloids have characters intermediate between the previous two groups, but they are much smaller, the fruiting bodies only forming one to a few spores.\n\nNon-amoebozoan slime moulds include:\n\nSlime molds begin life as amoeba-like cells. These unicellular amoebae are commonly haploid, and feed on bacteria. These amoebae can mate if they encounter the correct mating type and form zygotes that then grow into plasmodia. These contain many nuclei without cell membranes between them, and can grow to be meters in size. The species \"Fuligo septica\" is often seen as a slimy yellow network in and on rotting logs. The amoebae and the plasmodia engulf microorganisms. The plasmodium grows into an interconnected network of protoplasmic strands.\n\nWithin each protoplasmic strand, the cytoplasmic contents rapidly stream. If one strand is carefully watched for about 50 seconds, the cytoplasm can be seen to slow, stop, and then reverse direction. The streaming protoplasm within a plasmodial strand can reach speeds of up to 1.35 mm per second, which is the fastest rate recorded for any microorganism. Migration of the plasmodium is accomplished when more protoplasm streams to advancing areas and protoplasm is withdrawn from rear areas. When the food supply wanes, the plasmodium will migrate to the surface of its substrate and transform into rigid fruiting bodies. The fruiting bodies or sporangia are what we commonly see; they superficially look like fungi or molds but are not related to the true fungi. These sporangia will then release spores which hatch into amoebae to begin the life cycle again.\n\nIn \"Myxogastria\", the plasmodial portion of the life cycle only occurs after syngamy, which is the fusion of cytoplasm and nuclei of myxoamoebae or swarm cells. The diploid zygote becomes a multinucleated plasmodium through multiple nuclear divisions without further cell division. Myxomycete plasmodia are multinucleate masses of protoplasm that move by cytoplasmic streaming. In order for the plasmodium to move, cytoplasm must be diverted towards the leading edge from the lagging end. This process results in the plasmodium advancing in fan-like fronts. As it moves, plasmodium also gains nutrients through the phagocytosis of bacteria and small pieces of organic matter.\n\nThe plasmodium also has the ability to subdivide and establish separate plasmodia. Conversely, separate plasmodia that are genetically similar and compatible can fuse together to create a larger plasmodium. In the event that conditions become dry, the plasmodium will form a sclerotium, essentially a dry and dormant state. In the event that conditions become moist again the sclerotium absorbs water and an active plasmodium is restored. When the food supply wanes, the Myxomycete plasmodium will enter the next stage of its life cycle forming haploid spores, often in a well-defined sporangium or other spore-bearing structure.\n\nWhen a slime mold mass or mound is physically separated, the cells find their way back to re-unite. Studies on \"Physarum polycephalum\" have even shown an ability to learn and predict periodic unfavorable conditions in laboratory experiments. John Tyler Bonner, a professor of ecology known for his studies of slime molds, argues that they are \"no more than a bag of amoebae encased in a thin slime sheath, yet they manage to have various behaviours that are equal to those of animals who possess muscles and nerves with ganglia – that is, simple brains.\"\n\nAtsushi Tero of Hokkaido University grew \"Physarum\" in a flat wet dish, placing the mold in a central position representing Tokyo and oat flakes surrounding it corresponding to the locations of other major cities in the Greater Tokyo Area. As \"Physarum\" avoids bright light, light was used to simulate mountains, water and other obstacles in the dish. The mold first densely filled the space with plasmodia, and then thinned the network to focus on efficiently connected branches. The network strikingly resembled Tokyo's rail system.\n\n\n"}

Whether there is a master race to the Tenctonese, or if a small segment of the Tenctonese themselves rule the slaves under them, has never been made exactly clear, although it has been stated that they are a genetically engineered race designed for any work environment.\n\nOn October 19, 1990, a spacecraft from the planet Tencton crash-landed in California's Mojave Desert just outside Los Angeles. The slave ship \"Gruza\" was transporting 250,000 Tenctonese especially bred and genetically engineered for hard labor in any environment. The slave ship's overseers, identified by jagged wrist tattoos, used hallucinogenic nerve gases to induce fear and keep the slaves submissive. They also exploited the slaves' culture and mythology by personifying the roles of Tenctonese \"demons\". Because of the hallucinogenic gas and the intertwining of their cultural mythology and their condition of slavery, several years would pass before the Tenctonese could even remember there having been anyone on the slave ship to rebel against, or even that there had been attempts by slaves to rebel, such as the Udara faction.\n\nDespite the Overseers' attempts to subdue the slaves, a vibrant culture managed to survive the voyage. The Tenctonese elders functioned as a government-in-exile, and there was a recognized resistance force, as well as an extremist resistance faction called Udara, which \"seeded\" its own members as well as children on the slaveship with programming activated by post-hypnotic suggestion which turned the \"seeded\" individual into a programmable killing machine.\n\nThe Overseers arbitrarily punished innocent Tenctonese in retaliation for Udara's actions. Because of this, feelings about Udara were mixed. Some considered them heroes, while others considered them no better than the Overseers.\n\nInitially the U.S. government quarantined the aliens for several months and with the assistance of the Immigration and Naturalization Service each slave was given a human name. Most of the first Tenctonese to be processed received \"normal\" human names. However, as the aliens continued to pour in, INS workers became bored and overworked, and at times chose whimsical names, reflecting historical or literary characters and geographic settings. Some examples: Albert Einstein, Wyatt Earp, Betsy Ross, Buster Keaton, Emma Bovary, Silas Marner, Kenny Bunkport, Norman Conquest, May O'Naise, Sam Francisco, Phillip Dirt, Polly Wanakraker, and Paul Bearer.\n\nAfter being released from quarantine, the majority of the Tenctonese settled in an area of Los Angeles that became known as \"Little Tencton\" (or, abusively, \"Slagtown\"). They assimilated into American culture, becoming known as \"Newcomers,\" taking jobs wherever their individual talents might lie and becoming just another minority in the city.\n\nThe Newcomers are hated by some humans, self-proclaimed \"Purists\" who fear the alien presence on the planet. These people use the pejorative terms \"slags\", \"spongeheads\", or \"rubberheads\" when referring to these interstellar refugees, who in turn derogatorily call humans \"\"terts\", or \"Slo'ka\"\" — each being a different insult. Like any other minority group, the Newcomers face a daily battle just to maintain their civil rights.\n\nTenctonese are highly spiritual, and have at least three, and possibly more, major religions. The most common Tenctonese religious tradition is called Celinism, and is based on the idea of living by the example set by Celine and Andarko, a Tenctonese woman and man who sacrificed their own lives long ago to save many. Detective George Francisco and his immediate family practice Celinism.\n\nAnother religious tradition, practiced by Uncle Moodri, identified as only \"pre-Celinist,\" is distinguished by its matriarchial traditions and worship of the goddess Ionia. A third tradition, practiced by Cathy Frankel, is described as more like an Eastern tradition, being more \"internal.\" From what we know of Cathy's past and way of life, her religion seems to be based on the concept of worshipping the emotion love; she has been heard praying \"Love keep me.\" Also the Tenctonese third gender, the 'Binnaum,' appear to live in a style similar to Buddhist Monks and may be considered a religion on their own. Various \"Liubof\" (Russian for 'love') sects also exist among the Tenctonese, as well as a number of smaller cults that have broken with mainstream Tenctonese religion.\n\nDespite having religious differences, Tenctonese do not appear to experience many religious conflicts. As stated, even members of the same family may follow different faiths. Many Tenctonese of different faiths observe the same secular holidays, such as the Day of Descent.\n\nSome Tenctonese spiritual practices appear to transcend religious differences. One example is the \"serdso\", a colorful, palm-sized artifact which is said to carry the soul of an individual Tenctonese. It is placed near the bed every night, so that the soul, which wanders during sleep, can return to the waking world. Warriors in Tenctonese society were said to have fought for their \"serdsos\".\n\nIn addition, the matriarchal system of the pre-Celinists seems to have been inherited by the Celinists and possibly other Tenctonese religious groups, from the Pre-Celenist tradition. In the most traditional of Tenctonese villages, women are said to have made all the decisions, while the men only gathered roots and had babies. This has been relaxed by modern Tenctonese, but the matrilineal social structure has been maintained, as is evident in the female-dominated Tenctonese clergy and the tradition of men moving into women's homes, or \"nests\".\n\nPractitioners of the Celinist tradition make use of an object known either as the \"Portal\" or the \"Heart of Tencton,\" a technological marvel in the form of a small box with symbolic ornamentation, which is in fact capable of projecting virtual environments, including alien worlds, for its users to navigate as they attempt to reach a higher spiritual plane. The box contains a highly powerful energy source, and if opened incorrectly, will burn its handler into a charred corpse. The box, officially the property of the Tenctonese elders, was at one time appropriated illegally by a Tenctonese millennial splinter cult.\n\nThe Tenctonese have fairly mature attitudes towards sex: it happens and is enjoyable, and nothing to be ashamed about, but at the same time, they feel it is not something to be taken lightly. They find oversexualized human things such as pornography to be silly or juvenile. They also have no particular taboo against same-sex relationships.\n\nIronically, among the formerly enslaved Tenctonese is a lowly caste of \"Eenos.\" Eenos can be distinguished by a spotting pattern that is considered gray and ill-defined by other Tenctonese, who hardly consider Eenos to be of their own species. The reason for this is that Eenos performed the lowliest jobs on the slave ships, primarily involving waste-handling, and were forced to feed themselves from the waste, which included the bodies of the dead. Eenos are considered cannibals by the other Tenctonese, despite the fact that the situation was involuntarily forced upon them during slavery and they had no other option. Resentment is so strong between Eenos and other Tenctonese that most humans do not even know the Eenos exist. Upon reaching Earth, the caste system was maintained, with Eenos taking the jobs of the \"unclean,\" (waste management, etc.) and living primarily underground.\n\nThe Tenctonese refugees living on Earth have been faced with assimilating into human culture, while some staunchly believe they should stand by their own traditions. While \"binnaum\" males do not marry in their society (see \"Reproduction\"), some of them on Earth have entered into monogamous marriages.\n\nWhen a Tenctonese falls ill, even if they are recuperating in a hospital, it is customary to bring them gifts of living things such as small animals or potted plants to brighten their mood. Conversely, it is considered disturbing to bring them a gift of a bouquet of flowers (as humans often do in hospitals), because even if they are still fresh and colorful, the flowers are technically \"dead\" - and it is morbid to remind a sick person about mortality.\n\nAnother curious encounter between the two cultures is that the Tenctonese are very fond of clowns, including artwork of clowns. When Cathy moves into Matt's apartment she decorates it with numerous clown paintings and figurines. Partly this is because they enjoy that they are very colorful, partly because their alien culture has no equivalent to clowns (possibly because they were a slave race), and having never seen anything like them before, they think clowns are very interesting.\n\nThe Tenctonese look generally similar to humans, but have bulbous craniums and no hair on their scalps. Instead they have large reddish-brown spot-like markings on their heads and down their spines. These \"Potniki\" spots are an erogenous zone and will identify the individual and family. These markings will fade with the loss of mental faculties due to drunkenness, age, or drugs. This effect is similar to a human’s eyes losing focus and glazing over.\n\nSince they had been bred as slaves, the Newcomers are 30% stronger and 20% smarter than the average human, as well as having a life expectancy of about 140 years and keener senses. This is partially due to the way they have been bred for adaptability but also due to their anatomical differences, which include having two hearts. With two hearts, the onset time of poisons is halved. If one heart is damaged, the other will work harder for a limited time. One heart is located in approximately the same spot as a human heart, the second is located in the center of the chest at the bottom of the rib cage.\n\nAdditional differences include the fact that Tenctonese bodies do not assimilate the nutrients of food if it has been cooked. Their main diet consist of raw animal flesh such as uncooked small mammals (weasel, beaver, muskrat), organs (spleen, pancreas), molluscs and insects and raw vegetables. Drinking sour milk affects them in the same way that humans are intoxicated by alcohol. Rather than blush, the eyes of the Tenctonese change color with embarrassment. Instead of getting tense around the neck when they feel stress, their feet swell. Tenctonese ears look more like slits or holes in the sides of their heads but are still more sensitive than human ears. They also have no fingerprints, need large doses of ultraviolet light to increase energy levels, and suffer similar effects to acid burns when splashed with ordinary salt water.\n\nSome terrestrial diseases appear to affect the Tenctonese as well, though their reactions to these diseases may be different. For example, instead of sneezing, a Tenctonese affected by the common cold has a tendency to blink rapidly and in succession.\n\nTenctonese have very sensitive nerve clusters, or \"axials\", just underneath their armpit that are the physiological equivalent of human temples. Striking them there has the equivalent effect of kicking a human in the groin. If precisely struck with enough force, a blow to the axial can be fatal.\n\nCertain common compounds found on Earth are poisonous to the Newcomers and some compounds that are poisonous to humans are harmless to Tenctonese. Poisons include salt (harshly caustic); monosodium glutamate (MSG) (mild poison); chocolate (gives them the shakes, leads to a heart attack); tobacco (makes them stutter, leads to laryngitis); fluoride (strong poison); fluorocarbons (choking, leads to asphyxiation); and caffeine (causes dizziness). However, methane, alcohol, asbestos, and radon, have no effect on them. Some Newcomers, such as Uncle Moodri, have demonstrated an ability to touch salt water (Moodri actually walked in ocean water) without harm. Newcomers sprinkle arsenic flakes on their food, but it is unknown whether it is a required nutrient, or just tastes good to them.\n\nThe Newcomers have a number of organs that humans do not have, such as the \"spartiary gland\", which produces a substance in Tenctonese blood cells that accelerates healing by rapidly carrying oxygen and needed nutrients to injured areas, and gives Tenctonese blood its pink color. Because of the color of their blood, the skin of the Tenctonese has a pinker hue than human Caucasians.\n\nHaving been genetically engineered to adapt to harsh conditions, Tenctonese may evolve more rapidly in certain situations than human populations. It is not unheard of for Tenctonese to \"adapt\" in a single generation. This potential adaptability is addressed several times throughout the franchise by various characters. The original movie \"Alien Nation\" also introduced a drug used on the slave ship that, in an otherwise fatal environment, triggers a last-ditch physiological alteration in Newcomers.\n\nAt about eight weeks, the Tenctonese fetus, inside its pod, possesses several insect-like characteristics, including claws and an exoskeleton, suggesting that the Tenctonese evolved from an ancestor possessing these characteristics.\n\nOne sexual activity among Tenctonese, where one hums along the spots on his or her partner’s back, is referred to as \"humming\".\n\nTheir method of procreation is also unique. For the Newcomers to conceive, there are two kinds of Newcomer males, \"gannaum\" and \"binnaum\". Fertilization of the female’s egg requires both types of male. The \"binnaum\" prepares the \"linnaum\" (female) for fertilization. \"Binnaum\" children are rare (1 in 100) and do not take permanent mates. Instead, they are expected to grant their services as needed for the continuance of their race. A \"binnaum\" is recognizable by the oversized spots on his head. These individuals form a brotherhood and each of them service hundreds of females a year. The ceremony of fertilization is shared by close friends. While holding burning candles, those in attendance discreetly turn their backs on the female as the \"binnaum\" prepares her for her spouse. The \"binnaum\" prepares the \"channel\" with the catalyzing emission, and the \"gannaum\" (the father) provides the sperm. The \"binnaum\" does not contribute genetically to the offspring, however. The ejaculate of Newcomers is referred to as \"Aklafluid.\" The specific physical mechanics of the Tenctonese sex act are not explicitly stated, but their sex organs are implied to be radically different from those used in human reproduction. In the original movie, Matt tries to explain to George how a condom works by unfolding it over his fingers and loosely describing that it stretches, George is amazed that it can fit. Implying that the males of his species must have much larger reproductive organs.\n\nBinnaums, in addition to their role in reproduction, also demonstrate an ability to communicate with others on what has been described in the telemovies as a psychic plane. This communication, not limited to other binnaums, seems to take the form of telepathically transmitted imagery.\n\nAnother major difference between Newcomers and Humans is that the male and female Tenctonese share the burdens of reproduction equally, with the female carrying the baby for only the first eight weeks of the pregnancy. The baby is incubated in a pod called the \"haffacotta\" (pod surrounding the fetus) inside the mother's womb. As seen in the series episode Partners, the male and female remain biologically in-sync throughout the process so when the female begins to experience pangs of the coming separation, the male will experience pains in his \"lingpod flap\", which will also fall and open in preparation for the pod. The time of passing the pod to the father is a much celebrated happening in which the entire family participates. The mother enters a state of relaxation to allow her body to begin the process of transferring the \"haffacotta\". The female's navel opens and the pod's tentacle emerges. This tentacle is gently encouraged to suction to the father's chest. The pod is then passed out of the female womb through the navel. Charcoal powder is sprinkled on the navel to enable its closure. A hard shell develops around the pod as it dries in the open air, this shell is immediately cracked off gently and in some cases a piece is eaten by either or both parents. The sex is identifiable once the \"haffacotta\" is completely shelled and then the pod is gently placed inside the \"lingpod flap\" by both parents. The male will carry the \"haffacotta\" inside his \"lingpod flap\" for the remaining eight weeks of pregnancy, similar to a kangaroo's pouch, until he gives birth, much like a male seahorse.\n\nAs seen in the Alien Nation telemovie \"Body and Soul,\" Newcomer/Human copulation is possible, but if it is attempted without proper training, the human will suffer serious injury. Even simply attempting to copulate with a Newcomer can result in whiplash at the very least. Newcomer sex clinics exist in order to facilitate mixed-species relationships. Whether it is only human males who risk injury in sex with Newcomers, or if human women would be similarly affected via sex with Newcomer men, was never elaborated on. Male newcomers and human women have, however, been seen as couples in the series (Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Allan Poe of Nu-Knit, Inc.), and a homosexual male mixed-species couple attended classes at the sex clinic, so there is some circumstantial evidence that mixed-species copulations may pose a danger for both male and female humans.\n\nAs Newcomers have been known to adapt quickly to new environments, it has been theorized that the ability to interbreed with humans is only a matter of time. When a deformed Newcomer girl was publicized as a hybrid, outrage from both human Purist and Newcomer communities was naturally triggered, with both sides fearing that interbreeding would lead to pollution of their respective species' gene pools.\n\nIn the 8th and final novel of the series, \"Cross of Blood\", it was confirmed that Humans and Newcomers are (potentially) reproductively compatible, when Cathy Frankel (a Tenctonese female) became pregnant with Matthew Sikes' (a human male) child without the aid of a Binnaum\".\" In this case, unlike the normal Tenctonese gestation cycle, the Newcomer female carried the child for the full term of the pregnancy. However, the resulting offspring did not survive beyond the first few weeks of his birth, due to physiological incompatibilities resulting from his Tenctonese biology trying to overtake/override his human biology. This may have been a natural result of the pairing, or the result of tampering as the child had been kidnapped at birth and held by a Purist cell. With proper care and observation, it may have been possible for the child to have survived. However, the topic of cross-breeding did not come up again as Cross of Blood was the final novel of the franchise, and the subsequent comics did not approach that particular aspect of Human/Tenctonese relations again. \n\n\n"}

Terje decided to form Windir into a full band while he was at college, with some of his classmates becoming the other band members.\nValfar released two demos, \"Sogneriket\" and \"Det Gamle Riket\".\n\nHis second studio album, \"Arntor\", was the last Windir album recorded by a line-up consisting solely of Valfar.\n\nDespite his vocal style, Valfar did not relate his music to black metal, probably because of how the scene acted and was stereotyped. He instead dubbed Windir's musical style as \"Sognametal\". Other bands that have a Sognametal sound are Cor Scorpii, Vreid, Feigd, Mistur, and Sigtyr. He read a lot about Sogndal history that his poems stemmed from it.\n\nOn January 14, 2004, Valfar went for a walk towards his family's cabin at Fagereggi, but he never arrived.

Tip growth occurs in algae (e.g., \"Acetabularia acetabulum\"), fungi (hyphae) and plants (e.g. root hairs and pollen tubes).\n\nTip growth is a process that has many similarities in diverse walled cells such as pollen tubes, root hairs, and hyphae.\n\nFungal hyphae extend continuously at their extreme tips, where enzymes are released into the environment and where new wall materials are synthesised. The rate of tip extension can be extremely rapid - up to 40 micrometres per minute. It is supported by the continuous movement of materials into the tip from older regions of the hyphae. So, in effect, a fungal hypha is a continuously moving mass of protoplasm in a continuously extending tube. This unique mode of growth - apical growth - is the hallmark of fungi, and it accounts for much of their environmental and economic significance.\n"}
