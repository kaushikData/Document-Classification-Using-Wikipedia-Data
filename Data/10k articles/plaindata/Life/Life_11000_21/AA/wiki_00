{"id": "32661943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32661943", "title": "2011 England riots", "text": "2011 England riots\n\nThe 2011 England riots, more widely known as the London Riots were a series of riots between the 6th of August and 11 August 2011, when thousands of people rioted in cities and towns across England, saw looting, arson, and mass deployment of police, and resulted in the deaths of five people.\n\nProtests started in Tottenham, London, following the death of Mark Duggan, a local man who was shot dead by police on 4 August. Several violent clashes with police ensued, along with the destruction of police vehicles, a double-decker bus and many homes and businesses, thus rapidly gaining attention from the media. Overnight, looting took place in Tottenham Hale retail park and nearby Wood Green. The following days saw similar scenes in other parts of London, with the worst rioting taking place in Hackney, Brixton, Walthamstow, Peckham, Enfield, Battersea, Croydon, Ealing, Barking, Woolwich, Lewisham and East Ham.\n\nFrom 8 to 10 August, other towns and cities in England (including Birmingham, Coventry, Leicester, Derby, Wolverhampton, Northampton, Nottingham, West Bromwich, Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester, and Salford) saw what was described by the media as \"copycat violence\". Social media sites including Facebook also featured rumours of further disturbances or details surrounding known disturbances which were later proven to be inaccurate; for instance there were rumours of disturbances in the town of Dudley and at the nearby Merry Hill Shopping Centre, but no incidents in these areas were detected by police. Rumours of a hospital being targeted by rioters in Birmingham were also proven to be wrong, as were rumours of disturbances in the Heath Town district of Wolverhampton, which had witnessed a serious riot in May 1989.\n\nBy 10 August, more than 3,000 arrests had been made across England, with more than 1,000 people issued with criminal charges for various offences related to the riots. Initially, courts sat for extended hours. There were a total of 3,443 crimes across London that were linked to the disorder. as a direct result of related violent acts. An estimated £200 million worth of property damage was incurred, and local economic activity – which in many cases was already struggling due to the recession – was significantly compromised.\n\nThe riots have generated significant ongoing debate among political, social and academic figures about the causes and context in which they happened. Attributions for the rioters' behaviour include such social factors such as racial tension, class tension, economic decline and the unemployment that it had brought, as well as individual factors like criminality, hooliganism, the breakdown of social morality and the development of gang culture.\n\nOn Thursday 4 August 2011, a police officer shot and killed 29-year-old Mark Duggan during an intelligence-led, targeted vehicle stop procedure on the Ferry Lane bridge next to Tottenham Hale station. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said that the planned arrest was part of Operation Trident, which at that time investigated gun crime within the black community. The incident had been referred to the IPCC, which is standard practice if death or serious injury follows police contact.\n\nAfter the shooting, the media widely reported that a bullet was found embedded in a police radio, implying that Duggan fired on the police. Friends and relatives of Duggan said that he was unarmed. The police later revealed that initial ballistics tests on the bullet recovered from the police radio indicate that it was a \"very distinct\" police issue hollow-point bullet. The IPCC later stated that a loaded Bruni BBM blank-firing pistol, converted to fire live ammunition, was recovered from the scene. It was wrapped in a sock and there was no evidence that it had been fired.\n\nOn 13 August, the IPCC stated that Duggan did not open fire: \"It seems possible that we may have verbally led journalists to [wrongly] believe that shots were exchanged\". The bullet that had lodged in an officer's radio is believed to have been an overpenetration, having passed through Duggan's body.\n\nAt lunchtime on 6 August, a meeting was called by police between local community leaders, councillors and members of police advisory groups. In this meeting, police were warned several times that there could possibly be another riot similar to the Broadwater Farm riot of 1985 if local concerns regarding the death were not addressed.\n\nOn 8 January 2014, a jury at the Royal Courts of Justice concluded that Duggan was lawfully killed.\n\nOn Saturday 6 August, a protest was held, initially peacefully, beginning at Broadwater Farm and finishing at Tottenham police station. The protest was organised by friends and relatives of Duggan to demand justice for the family. The group of some 300 people demanded that a senior local police officer come out to speak to them. When Chief Inspector Ade Adelekan arrived, he was met with boos and cries of \"murderer\", \"Uncle Tom\" and \"coconut\".\nThe crowd stayed in front of the police station hours longer than they originally planned because they were not satisfied with the seniority of the officers available at the time. Rumours that a 16-year-old girl had sustained injuries after attacking police with a champagne bottle began circulating on social media. To date, the girl remains unidentified and the report unconfirmed. However the rumour alone was sufficient to further fuel tensions in the area.\n\nA peaceful march on Saturday 6 August in Tottenham was followed by rioting and looting, first in Tottenham and later in Tottenham Hale Retail Park. Rioting occurred shortly after about 120 people marched from the Broadwater Farm estate to Tottenham Police Station via the High Road.\n\nThe spread of news and rumours about the previous evening's disturbances in Tottenham sparked riots during the night of Sunday 7 August in the London districts of Brixton, Enfield, Islington and Wood Green and in Oxford Circus in the centre of London.\nThe morning of Monday 8 August was quiet, but by evening, areas across London were affected by widespread looting, arson and violence, with significant outbreaks in parts of Battersea, Brixton, Bromley, Camden, Croydon, Ealing, East Ham, Hackney, Harrow, Lewisham, Peckham, Stratford, Waltham Forest, Woolwich, and Wood Green. A man was found shot in Croydon, and died later in hospital. Another man who had been assaulted in Ealing died in hospital on Thursday 11 August.\n\nSimilar riots were reported outside London – notably in Birmingham, Bristol, Gloucester, Gillingham and Nottingham.\nFollowing a greatly increased police presence, London was quiet on Tuesday 9 August, but rioting continued in Nottingham and Birmingham (where, according to the police account, eleven shots were fired at police, including at a police helicopter, and petrol bombs thrown at officers) and spread to Leicester, parts of the West Midlands and to parts of Greater Manchester and Merseyside in the north-west of England. On Wednesday 10 August, London remained quiet while hundreds of arrests were being made by the police.\n\nThree men were killed in Birmingham in a hit-and-run incident related to the disturbances. Looting and violence continued in two locations around Manchester and Liverpool.\n\nThroughout the rioting, many of the rioters failed to cover their faces. Some posed for pictures with stolen goods, posting them on social-networking sites.\n\nAlthough London employs CCTV cameras to monitor crime and large events, reports indicate that citizen footage contributed more to capturing looters in action than the police force. Beyond the CCTV, looters were filmed and photographed with their faces visible. Police forces and investigators used websites like Flickr to find galleries of the looters to help solve and prevent cases of vandalism and further damage. Facebook pages were also created to identify looters.\nSeveral interactive maps were implemented in the Google Maps website that showed satellite views of what was happening in the streets during the rioting. James Cridland, the managing director of the free media resources, created a Google Map that tracked verified locations of rioting.\nChannel 4 News also had similar maps that progressively tracked the damage in the streets as well. News channels also were able to utilise this public service to capture live footage on the streets and inform citizens of dangerous or crowded areas.\n\nThere were reports that the BlackBerry Messenger service was used by looters to organise their activities, and that inflammatory and inaccurate accounts of Mark Duggan's killing on social media sites may have incited disturbances. One of the many messages shared between users was the following:\n\n\"Everyone in edmonton enfield wood green everywhere in north link up at enfield town station at 4 o clock sharp!!!!,\" it began. \"Start leaving ur yards n linking up with your niggas. Fuck da feds, bring your ballys and your bags trollys, cars vans, hammers the lot!!\"\nResearch in Motion assisted British police in tracking rioters who used BBM, stating, \"We comply with the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act and co-operate fully with the Home Office and UK police forces.\"\n\nIncreased connectivity among individuals has led to a greater ability to organise and execute massive gatherings. This has not occurred only with the riots in England, but with other collective gatherings such as the Arab Spring and the Egyptian revolution of 2011.\n\nMuch like BBM, the mobility of technology shaped the London riots. During the Tottenham riots of 1985, citizens had to head into a public place to voice their message. Yet, with access to Twitter as a communication medium, social media was used to rapidly spread messages of the riots.\n\nRadio 4 criticised Twitter's contribution to the riots through greed and criminality. \"The Daily Telegraph\" described Twitter as being an outlet for promoting gang violence. Evidence shows that Twitter is powerful because tweets of individuals were inspired by news content. However, an article in \"Time\" magazine suggested BlackBerry Messenger was more to blame.\n\nDuring the riots, Twitter accounted for four out of every 170 UK Internet visits on Monday 8 August. In addition, citizens also used Twitter to band together, after the destruction.\nThe aftermath of the riots resulted in a disrupted city, yet Twitter was further used to maintain peace, with hashtags including \"#riotcleanup\". Evidence shows that people were tweeting and re-tweeting news related to the riots, not original content.\n\nOther than BlackBerry Messenger and social networking sites, mobile phone operators T-Mobile and Orange prioritised police requests for information about the phones that were used to plan the riots that hit British cities. Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, phone companies were required to hand over data about the locations calls were made from, the owners of phones, and lists of calls made to and from a particular handset.\n\nTrevor Ellis, a 26-year-old from Brixton Hill, died following a shooting in Croydon, South London on 8 August. His family denied reports that Ellis, who had come from the Brixton area to Croydon with a group of friends, had been involved in looting. By 16 December 2013, 13 people had been arrested in connection with the murder. All were later bailed and then released without action. On 16 December, the eve of Ellis's birthday, detectives opened up a fresh appeal into the murder, asking for witnesses to come forward. As of 2018, no one has been charged.\n\nOn 10 August, in Winson Green, Birmingham, three men – Haroon Jahan, 21, and brothers Shahzad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31 – were killed in a hit-and-run incident while attempting to protect their neighbourhood from rioters and looters. On 19 April 2012, a trial of eight men, each arraigned on three counts of murder, was held in the Crown Court at Birmingham before Mr Justice Flaux; the jury acquitted all of the defendants on all charges.\n\nA 68-year-old man, Richard Mannington Bowes, died on 11 August after he was attacked while attempting to stamp out a litter-bin fire in Ealing on the evening of 8 August.\n\nBowes was attacked by members of a mob on 8 August 2011, while attempting to extinguish a fire that had been deliberately started in industrial bins on Spring Bridge Road. The attack inflicted severe head injuries which resulted in a coma. The assault was caught on CCTV and reportedly filmed on mobile phones by associates of the alleged assailant. The attack on Bowes was witnessed by several police officers, but due to the number of rioters they were unable to come to his aid until riot squad officers pushed back the rioters while being attacked to reach Bowes.\nA line of officers then held back the rioters as paramedics arrived. Bowes' wallet and phone had been stolen, and police faced difficulty in identifying him. He died of his injuries at St Mary's Hospital on 11 August 2011 after being removed from life support.\n\nMany tributes were paid to Bowes, including Ealing Council, who flew the Union Flag at half-mast over its town hall and announced the launch of a relief fund in his name, and then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who described him as a hero.\n\nA sixteen-year-old male, later named as Darrell Desuze, who lives in Hounslow was charged with the murder of Bowes, violent disorder and four burglaries. He appeared at Croydon Magistrates' Court on 16 August 2011, where he was remanded in custody until his appearance at the Central Criminal Court on 18 August 2011. His 31-year-old mother Lavinia Desuze was charged with perverting the course of justice. On 12 March 2012 at the Crown Court at Inner London, Darrel Desuze pleaded guilty to manslaughter, after previously pleading guilty to burglary and violent disorder. The following day the Crown withdrew the murder charge against him. After a trial at the Crown Court at Inner London before Mr Justice Saunders and a jury, Lavinia Desuze was convicted of perverting the course of justice after she destroyed the clothing her son wore on the day of Bowes' death. On 17 April 2012, Mr Justice Saunders sentenced Darrell Desuze to detention for a term of eight years, and Lavinia Desuze to imprisonment for eighteen months.\n\nIn London, between Monday afternoon and the early hours of Tuesday, 14 people were injured by rioters.\nThese included a 75-year-old woman who suffered a broken hip in Hackney.\n\nIn Barking, East London, 20-year-old Malaysian student Ashraf Rossli was beaten and then robbed twice by looters emptying his rucksack. Footage of the second mugging, which appears to show the second set of muggers pretend to help him then proceed to ransack his rucksack, was uploaded onto YouTube. He suffered a broken jaw, requiring surgery. On 2 March 2012, two men, John Kafunda of Ilford and Reece Donovan of Romford, were found guilty of the robbery of Rossli and also violent disorder by a jury at Wood Green Crown Court. The sentences were quashed by the Court of Appeal on 29 November 2012.\n\nIn Chingford, East London, three police officers were hit by a car used as a getaway vehicle by a group who looted the Aristocrat store on Chingford Mount Road. Two of the officers were seriously injured and taken to hospital.\nIn total, 186 police officers were injured as well as 3 Police Community Support Officers. Five police dogs were also reported injured.\n\nTen firefighters were injured as the London Fire Brigade dealt with over 100 serious fires caused by the disturbances. The LFB also reported that eight of its fire engines had their windscreens smashed and that two fire cars were attacked.\n\nVehicles, homes and shops were attacked and set alight. At least 100 homes were destroyed in the arson and looting. Shopkeepers estimated the damages in their Tottenham Hale and Tottenham branches at several million pounds. The riots caused the irretrievable loss of heritage architecture. It was estimated that retailers lost at least 30,000 trading hours.\n\nThe Association of British Insurers said they expect the industry to pay out in excess of £200 million. Estimated losses in London were indicated to be in the region of £100m.\n\nOn 8 August 2011, a Sony DADC warehouse in Enfield at Enfield Lock, which also acted as the primary distribution centre for independent music distributor PIAS Entertainment Group, was destroyed by fire. Initially, because millions of items of stock were lost, including most of PIAS's inventory, it was thought that long-term damage to the British independent music industry might result. On 18 August 2011, PIAS confirmed that their operations were back to normal. On 11 August 2011, London police reported that they had arrested three teenagers in connection with the warehouse fire.\n\nThe \"Financial Times\" reported that an analysis showed that 48,000 local businesses – shops, restaurants, pubs and clubs – had suffered financial losses as a result of the looting and rioting in English streets.\n\nA 15-year-old was accused in August 2011 of raping a 13-year-old girl while the riots were taking place. The prosecution described the incident as being geographically \"close\" to the riots.\n\nTwenty-year-old student Ashraf Haziq was attacked while cycling along Queen's Road in Barking. The prosecution said that the victim was punched in the face by one of a group of 100 youths. His bike, PlayStation Portable and mobile phone were stolen. In September 2011, an accusation of robbery was made against 24-year-old Reece Donovan.\nThe same month, a 17-year-old was accused in court of breaking the victim's jaw with an unprovoked punch. In February 2012 John Kafunda and Reece Donovan were convicted of stealing from Rossli, after being identified on camera pretending to help him. Sony offered to replace his PSP after a video of the attack became viral, and Namco Bandai sent him a package of games.\n\nFour London buses were set on fire during the riots, and other buses were defaced with broken windows and other minor damage.\n\nOn 9 August, Croydon's Tramlink was partly shut down due to damage inflicted along its route. Transport for London, London Overground and London Underground shut Barking, Peckham Rye and Harrow-on-the-Hill and Hackney Central stations.\nThe train operating company Southern later announced that trains were not stopping at many stations in south London. National Express Coaches stopped serving Wolverhampton and suburban stops in the Birmingham area (but not Birmingham Coach Station itself) and Manchester (but not Manchester Airport).\n\nFive Football League Cup games due to be played on 9 and 10 August were postponed after requests from police due to the riots. The games at Bristol City, Bristol Rovers, Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace and West Ham United were all postponed, as they were all situated within a short distance of areas which had seen some of the worst disturbances. There was also uncertainty as to the Third Test cricket match between India and England, at Edgbaston in Birmingham, but the match was played.\n\nThe international football friendly match between England and the Netherlands at Wembley Stadium due to take place on 10 August was cancelled, as well as the international friendly between Ghana and Nigeria scheduled for 9 August at Vicarage Road, Watford.\n\nTottenham Hotspur's opening game of the 2011–12 Premier League season against Everton on 13 August was postponed. The League Two game between Cheltenham Town and Swindon Town, due to be played the same day, was also initially postponed until further consultation allowed Gloucestershire Police to provide the required resources.\n\nFollowing the initial disorder in Tottenham, the constituency Labour MP David Lammy appealed for calm, saying that \"true justice can only follow a thorough investigation of the facts\" and that Tottenham had had its \"heart ripped out\" by the riots. He said that rioters were not representative of the local community as a whole and insisted that the Independent Police Complaints Commission must fully establish the circumstances of Mark Duggan's death. Lammy voiced concerns that the EDL and BNP were playing on the London riots and people's fears to advance their political motives.\n\nStreatham's Labour MP Chuka Umunna condemned the violence in Brixton and Tottenham. Umunna called for the BlackBerry Messenger service, used by some of the rioters to co-ordinate their activities, to be \"temporarily disabled\" between 6 pm and 6 am BST.\n\nThe use of BlackBerry Messenger has led to arrests – a Colchester man was detained under the Serious Crimes Act.\n\nJohn Randall, the Conservative MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip said: \"It’s a small minority of people causing the trouble. The events in Ealing brought it home, it’s just down the Uxbridge Road.\" Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP Diane Abbott called for the introduction of a curfew.\n\nNewark MP Colonel Patrick Mercer called for the deployment of water cannon. In December 2010 Theresa May, the Home Secretary, had said that the deployment of water cannon by police forces on the British mainland was an operational decision which had been \"resisted until now by senior police officers.\" On 9 August 2011, May rejected their use and said: \"The way we police in Britain is not through use of water cannon. The way we police in Britain is through consent of communities.\" Ken Livingstone, the former London mayor, said \"The issue of water cannon would be very useful given the level of arson we are seeing here.\" Scotland Yard said officers did not have any water cannon and if their use was approved they would have to be brought over from Northern Ireland.\n\nMay said: \"I condemn utterly the violence in Tottenham... Such disregard for public safety and property will not be tolerated, and the Metropolitan Police have my full support in restoring order.\" She returned to the UK from holiday early to meet senior police officials on 8 August.\n\nA spokesman for the Prime Minister's office added: \"The rioting in Tottenham last night was utterly unacceptable. There is no justification for the aggression the police and the public faced, or for the damage to property.\"\n\nThe deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said that the riots were \"completely unacceptable\" and described the rioters as \"needless and opportunistic\".\n\nLondon's mayor, Boris Johnson, who cut short a holiday in Canada to return to the UK on 9 August, said: \"I'm appalled at the scenes of violence and destruction in Tottenham\" whilst his deputy Kit Malthouse told a Sky News reporter that \"criminal elements were to blame for the trouble.\"\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron condemned the \"terrible scenes of people looting, vandalising, thieving, robbing\" and told rioters \"You will feel the full force of the law. And if you are old enough to commit these crimes, you are old enough to face the punishment.\"\n\nCroydon Central MP Gavin Barwell called the damage caused in the London Borough of Croydon \"sickening\".\n\nIn a strongly worded criticism of what he deems to be a misplaced \"hyper-sensitivity about race\", dating back to the Macpherson Report of 1999, Civitas director David Green attributed the reluctance by police to use force to a fear of disciplinary action. He said that \"officers in charge of a riot think it safer to wait for orders from the top\".\n\nIn a public speech on 15 August, David Cameron blamed a \"broken society\" in \"moral collapse\" – broad societal change themes common to his party's election campaign theme Broken Britain.\n\nThe city councils of Manchester and Salford are reported to be investigating their powers for ways of evicting tenants if they, or their children, have been involved in violence or looting in their cities. The London Borough of Greenwich also stated on its website: \"We shall seek the eviction of anyone living in council property if they are found to have been engaged in criminal acts.\"\n\nSeveral countries issued warnings advising caution to travellers visiting the United Kingdom during the riots.\n\nGerman far-left activists suggested using the riots as a role model to be applied to their political activities in Germany as well.\n\nThe riots were described by one journalist as \"the worst disturbances of their kind since the 1995 Brixton riots\".\n\nCommentators likened the riots to the Broadwater Farm riot of 1985, during which a police officer, Keith Blakelock, was murdered.\nThe disturbances were preceded by calls for better oversight of the Metropolitan Police, repeating observations which go back to the death of Stephen Lawrence and the New Cross Fire.\nIn April 2011 there was a large nonviolent march to Scotland Yard as a result of the death of Smiley Culture. The very widespread scale of the violence prompted comparisons with the Gordon Riots of 1780.\n\n\"The Sun\" called the scenes \"shameful\" and lamented that \"[w]ith the London Olympics less than a year away, our reputation is being damaged at the worst moment\". It added: \"This is anarchy, pure and simple. And it presents a serious threat to life and property.\"\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\"s editorial said: \"What we have experienced in London and elsewhere since Saturday night is a wholly new phenomenon: violent disorder whose sole intent is criminal... In such circumstances, there can be only one response if the law-abiding majority is to be protected: the thugs must be taught to respect the law of the land the hard way.\"\n\n\"The Telegraph\" also reported: \"Tottenham riots: police let gangs run riot and loot: Britain’s biggest police force is facing criticism after it let looters run riot in north London for almost 12 hours...\"\n\n\"The Guardian\" called on the public to back the police: \"... Britain's 2011 riots have become a defining contest between disorder and order. In that contest, important caveats notwithstanding, there is only one right side to be on. The attacks, the destruction, the criminality and the reign of fear must be stopped. The rule of law in the cities of Britain must not only be defended against delinquent destruction. It must also be enforced.\"\n\nDuring the height of the riots, \"The Guardian\" was accused of anti-Semitic incitement by the media monitoring organisation, Comment Is Free Watch (CiFW), after Guardian journalist Paul Lewis singled out Hasidic Jewish residents who were not involved in the rioting. The content of his report stated, \"The make-up of the rioters was racially mixed. Most were men or boys, some apparently as young as 10….But families and other local residents, including some from Tottenham's Hasidic Jewish community, also gathered to watch and jeer at police.\" CIFW responded by condemning the newspaper saying, \"A 1,800 Guardian report doesn't mention the race, ethnicity, or religion of the rioters, somehow found it pertinent to note that some of those who gathered to jeer police were, allegedly, Hasidic Jews.\" As a result of the negative publicity, \"The Guardian\" revised the story.\n\nIn its 9 August leading article, \"The Independent\" said the police's handling of Mark Duggan's death \"looks to have been poor\", and that there is \"context of mistrust of the police here.\" The paper added that \"it is spurious to draw a connection between that disaffection [by the inner-city youth] and specific outbreaks of violence of the sort we have seen in recent days.\"\n\nPeter Hitchens of \"The Mail on Sunday\" disputed the idea that the events were riots on the basis that they were fundamentally apolitical. He further stated: \"This is an equal-opportunity crime wave. The lawbreakers are not from any distinct ethnic group, and attempts to explain this behaviour on these ground are baseless and poisonous.\"\n\nPsychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple wrote an opinion piece for the \"New York Daily News\", in which he blamed the \"sense of entitlement\" that he sees as being common among Britain's youth as a cause for the riots, and said that British youth are today among \"the most unpleasant and violent in the world\" as a result.\n\nSome journalists made comparisons between these riots and the 2005 riots in France. In both cases, the unrest started with the death of a young person during a confrontation with the police. In fact, a television report by France 2, broadcast in November 2005, showed a visit by a delegation from Évry (just outside Paris) to Tottenham, with the report calling \"Tottenham part of London 'regularly shaken by riots' in earlier decades, where 'a lot of money was invested' and 'the promotion of ethnic minorities', had been made a priority.\"\n\nWriting in Pakistan's \"Newsline\", Mahir Ali likened the government's response to that of Margaret Thatcher to the 1981 England riots.\n\nMany people called for the government to urge the police to deploy anti-riot methods often used outside Great Britain, such as water cannon and baton rounds (which have been used in Northern Ireland), the use of which has long been resisted by senior police commanders and politicians.\n\nPauline Pearce, a 45-year-old woman from Hackney, was filmed close to the rioting, furiously chastising looters over their criminal behaviour. She is seen holding a walking-stick and gesturing. The resulting \"Heroine of Hackney\" video subsequently went viral.\nIts rapid spread was helped by tweeting from famous people such as newspaper editor Piers Morgan and former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. Pearce was hailed as a heroine for helping to ease tensions in Hackney; her influence was acknowledged by politicians and the national press. MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, Meg Hillier, has invited Pearce to the Houses of Parliament. Speaking to \"The Australian\" newspaper, Pearce described the looting and vandalism as being \"heart-breaking\" and also contrasted people's relative poverty with expenditure for the Olympic Games. Pearce has since been featured in \"The Spectator\", dismissing David Starkey's view that hip-hop culture was partly to blame for the riots. In September 2011, she was awarded the Team London Award at the annual Peace Awards by Boris Johnson.\n\nOn Amazon, sales of baseball bats and truncheons increased significantly overnight. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stephen Kavanagh stated: \"We are already seeing a community kickback. People are angry. This is their neighbourhoods that are at stake.\" Political commentator and foreign affairs analyst Nile Gardiner suggested that the British Government should prompt a debate which will allow British business owners the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nThree men killed in a hit-and-run incident in Birmingham, Haroon Jahan, Shazad Ali, and Abdul Musavir Tariq, were described as heroes for dying while attempting to defend their neighbourhood. Tariq Jahan, the father of 21-year-old victim Haroon Jahan, gave a speech appealing for calm, social unity and an end to the violence, hours after his son's death. Jahan was hailed as a hero and a patriot for helping to ease tensions in Birmingham; his influence was acknowledged by politicians and the national press, receiving an award at the 2011 Pride of Britain Awards. Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said of him: \"Uncomplaining, in control of his emotions, Tariq Jahan reminds us of what it means to be British.\" The \"Financial Times\" described Jahan as eloquent and inspiring, and said \"His selfless intervention contrasted with the rapacious self-interest of the looters, and was a timely reminder of the obligations of community.\"\n\nTens of thousands of users of social networking sites coordinated clean-up operations of their local shopping areas and streets. Social media sites Twitter and Facebook were also used for reporting information on the riots and to co-ordinate a voluntary citizens' operation to clear up riot-hit areas. In Clapham Junction, dozens of volunteers carrying brooms turned out to assist with clean-up efforts. On Facebook, over 900,000 people joined a group entitled 'Supporting the Met Police against the London rioters'.\n\nManchester City Councillor Pat Karney, the city centre spokesperson for Manchester City Council, said: \"The true Mancunian civic spirit has been shown in Manchester today.\" Staff from city centre businesses and Manchester Metropolitan University joined the volunteers, as food outlets gave out free drinks and snacks. There were several fundraising initiatives to help independent business owners re-build their businesses and livelihoods.\n\nA petition was submitted to the UK government proposing that any convicted rioters have their benefit payments cut. This petition has been signed by over 200,000 people.\n\nA petition on the UK government website demanding convicted rioters to be banished to the Outer Hebrides of Scotland was set up in the summer of 2011. The reaction caused a public outcry in Scotland and eventually Westminster offered an apology to Western Isles MP Angus Brendan MacNeil.\n\nBy 20:00 on 7 August, the major rioting had spread to Wood Green, but some riot police were on hand. Again, the police did not intervene to stop the looting. The mostly Turkish and Kurdish shop owners along Wood Green, Turnpike Lane and Green Lanes, Harringay, were said to have formed local 'protection units' around their shops.\n\nOn 8 and 9 August, people from Indian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Kurdish, Turkish, Sikh and English communities chased down masked youths in several areas of North and East London, including Green Street, Hackney, Haringey, and Tower Hamlets. Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan praised the community for their brave and responsible reactions to the crisis.\n\nOn 9 August, vigilantes included English locals in Enfield which included several members of the English Defence League, locals and supporters of Millwall F.C. in Eltham, and the Sikh communities in Southall, East Ham, Ilford, and Romford.\n\nSangat TV and Sikh Channel urged their viewers to protect Sikh temples after a report that one was attacked in Birmingham. On the night of 9–10 August 2011, following violence, arson and rioting in London, members of the Sikh community in Southall volunteered to stand guard at various city Gurdwaras, with as many as 200 to 300 Sikhs from different age groups gathered in various Gurudwaras across Southall to safeguard their places of worship from rioters, some armed with swords and hockey sticks. The Sikhs drew praise from Prime Minister David Cameron for this action.\n\nOn 10 August in Eltham, police clashed with a bottle-throwing crowd of about 200 vigilantes, including many English Defence League members. It was reported that 50 EDL members joined forces with locals to patrol the streets. That same day, a senior police officer said that some vigilante groups were hampering police operations in London. 90 EDL members also joined vigilantes in Enfield.\n\nThe ethnic makeup of the rioters varied in different cities: 76% of those arrested in Manchester were white, while 29% were white and 39% black in London, and the West Midlands was the only area where more than 6% were Asian.\n\nResearch conducted by the University of Nottingham suggested that race relations in Britain deteriorated in the period following the riots and that prejudice towards ethnic minorities increased. After the hit-and-run incident in Birmingham, in which three Asian men were killed by a black driver, racial tensions between blacks and Asians in Birmingham increased; hostilities were defused by the public appeals for an end to violence by Tariq Jahan, father of one of the victims.\n\nThe effects of black culture were discussed by historian David Starkey in the edition of the BBC's \"Newsnight\" TV programme of 12 August. Starkey singled out the influence of black gangster and rap culture on youths of all races, contrasting contemporary youth patois with the speech patterns of black Tottenham MP David Lammy, who, Starkey asserted, \"sounded white\". The author Dreda Say Mitchell countered his argument by saying that there is no one single \"black culture\".\n\nSome commentators remarked on the apparently high proportion of black people involved in the riots and took the view that there was a disproportionately high number of rioters who were black, compared to the overall demographics of the United Kingdom. As the Ministry of Justice has admitted \"the group of people brought before the courts is only a subset of all people who took part in the public disorder\". In February 2012 a report was published by the Ministry of Justice providing demographic statistics of the people charged over participation the riots up to 1 February 2012 which revealed that 41% of those brought before the courts identified themselves as being from the White group, 39% from the Black ethnic group, 12% from the Mixed ethnic group, 6% the Asian ethnic group, and 2% the Other ethnic group. These figures were disproportionate to the average UK population; however the figures revealed varying demographics in different areas when compared to local populations. For example, in Haringey, the figures revealed that 55% of defendants in court over riot-related charges were black, compared to a 17% black population; in Salford, 94% of rioters in court were white, compared to an 88% white population, and 6% of rioters were black, compared to a 2% black population. Additionally, looters from 44 foreign countries were jailed, with Jamaicans representing the largest group.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice report also noted that rioters brought before the courts were disproportionately male (89%) and young (53% were aged 20 or under, with the number of \"juveniles\" ranging from 26% in London to 39% in Merseyside, and very few listed as over 40).\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service launched Operation Withern, an investigation into the events leading up to and during the riots. The operation was initially led by Detective Superintendent John Sweeney of the Metropolitan Police Service, with detectives from the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, specialist investigators from the Public Order Branch, and police support staff. Detective Superintendent Robin Bhairam, took over the post event investigation, where officers were drawn from all over the MPS, from different business groups, and placed into 10 Investigation Hubs across London. The Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Steve Kavanagh, stated that the number of officers deployed tripled between 6 and 7 August.\n\nThe BBC reported that West Midlands riot police officers were issued with plastic bullets to use against looters, but that none were fired. Metropolitan Police deputy assistant commissioner Stephen Kavanagh confirmed that police in London were considering using baton rounds against rioters, not previously used by mainland police in public order operations (though they were first approved for use in England and Wales in 2001).\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service has assigned 450 detectives to hunt for rioters and looters. The list of photographed looters has been made available on their website. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan of Greater Manchester Police criticised \"unprecedented\" criminality. On 10 August, he warned: \"Hundreds and hundreds of people, we have your image, we have your face, we have your acts of wanton criminality on film.\"\n\nResearch in Motion (RIM), the maker of the BlackBerry, are reported to have contacted the police to offer help in investigating the use of their system for the organisation of riots.\n\nAccording to \"The Independent\", the costs to the Metropolitan Police of policing the disorder and disturbances in London are expected to exceed £34 million.\nThis could be more than their total bill for the policing of all major public disorder events in the year from April 2010 to March 2011.\n\nBy 15 August 2011 around 3,100 people had been arrested, of whom over 1,100 had appeared in court. On 25 August the BBC reported that more than 2,000 people had been arrested in connection with the disorder in London.\n\nIt was reported in mid-August that some courts were advised by senior justice clerks to deal harshly with offences committed during the disturbances. The advice was said to tell the courts that they could ignore existing sentencing guidelines and hand down heavy sentences. David Cameron defended the courts for handing out tough sentences, while some Liberal Democrat MPs and civil rights groups criticised some sentences being handed down. Groups of lawyers complained that Crown Prosecutors were opposing bail in more cases than usual.\n\nOn 1 September 2011 the BBC reported that official Ministry of Justice figures showed that of the 1,566 people that had appeared before magistrates on charges connected with the disorder, 1,027 had been in London, 190 in Greater Manchester, 132 in the West Midlands, 67 in Merseyside and 64 in Nottingham.\n\nSentences of four years in a Young Offender Institution were given to two men who promoted riots via Facebook. The proposed events in Northwich and Warrington were not attended by any other people. These sentences were affirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeal.\nGiving the judgment of the court, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Judge, sitting with Sir John Thomas and Lord Justice Leveson, stated that there is \"an overwhelming obligation on sentencing courts to do what they can to ensure the protection of the public\", that \"the imposition of severe sentences, intended to provide both punishment and deterrence, must follow\" and that \"[t]hose who deliberately participate in disturbances of this magnitude, causing injury and damage and fear to even the most stout-hearted of citizens, and who individually commit further crimes during the course of the riots are committing aggravated crimes\". The appeals were dismissed.\n\nOn 25 April 2012, the Court of Appeal (Lord Judge CJ, Openshaw & Irwin JJ) increased the sentence imposed by the Crown Court at Inner London on Adam Ahmadzai from four years detention to seven years detention for offences of violent disorder, robbery, burglary and criminal damage committed during the riots on 8 August 2011, after a reference from Attorney General, Dominic Grieve QC. The Lord Chief Justice stated that the offences were of the \"greatest possible seriousness\".\n\nA woman who had not taken part in the riots received five months for receiving a pair of stolen shorts. The sentence was later reduced on appeal. Manchester police used Twitter to celebrate the five-month sentence; they later apologised and removed the tweet. A teenager was freed when prosecutors found evidence he had been wrongly charged with arson.\nWhile in prison, his own flat was burned down. The detaining of under-18s without criminal records was criticised by UNICEF in October 2011 for possibly breaching the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nBy August 2012, 1292 rioters had been handed custodial sentences totalling 1,800 years at 16.8 months on an average.\n\nThe Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn presented a piece of new writing, \"The Riots\" by Gillian Slovo, which looked into the events over those days in August and the thoughts and opinions of a range of people directly involved and politicians. It transferred to the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham, about 400 m from where the Mark Duggan protest took place, on 5 January 2012, and was due to run until 15 January.\nThe piece attempts to show a non-biased look into the events, allowing audience members to hear different views into why it happened and what could have and should now be done. The piece includes community leaders Stafford Scott and Martin Sylvester Brown, police constables on duty that night and a former resident of the Carpet-Right building, the burned remains now providing a highly poignant reminder of the events.\nThey are combined with the views of Diane Abbott, Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Gove and Pastor Nims Obunge. It was received well by all critics, with 4 stars from all major press including \"The Guardian\".\n\nAustralian mod rock band The Feldons reference the riots in their song London Town from their 2012 album \"Goody Hallett and Other Stories\".\n\nWhile authorities and mass media referred to these events as riots, sympathisers described them as protest, insurrection, or \"English Spring\" (to parallel the Arab Spring).\n\nThe causes of the 2011 England riots both immediate and long-term have been the subject of media and academic debate. Several speculations have emerged as to what the likely contributory factors might be for the riots; from socio-economic causes focusing on unemployment and spending cuts, as well as social media, gang culture and criminal opportunism. The House of Commons Home Affairs select committee will begin examining the police response to the riots in late 2011.\nThe leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, called for a public inquiry into the wider causes of the riots and has stated that his party would set up such an inquiry if the coalition fails to do so. The UK was shaken by its worst riots in decades.\n\nA wide-ranging LSE study called \"Reading the Riots\" concluded that the major contributory factors were opportunism, perceived social injustice, deprivation, and frustration at the way communities were policed.\n\nA YouGov poll was carried out on 8–9 August 2011 for \"The Sun\" asking what those surveyed believed to be the main cause of the riots. In it, 42% of those polled thought \"criminal behaviour\" to be the main cause, whilst 26% thought \"gang culture\" was, 8% thought \"government cuts\" were, 5% thought \"unemployment\" was, 5% thought \"racial tensions\" was and 3% thought \"poor policing\" was. In a ComRes poll for the \"Sunday Mirror\" and \"Independent on Sunday\", in which the question was \"do you agree or disagree with these statements about the recent riots?\", 90% of those polled agreed that the \"Police should be allowed to water cannon to disperse rioters\", 90% agreed that \"There is no excuse whatsoever for the violent rioting and looting over the last few days\", 61% agreed that \"Government ministers failed to return to their desks quickly enough from holidays\" and 50% agreed that \"The Government's response to the economic crisis (e.g. cuts to services, unemployment, reduced education funding) is helping fuel the rioters\".\n\nResearchers who study the causes of political instability suggest that the critical common factor is the density of youths. A nation's extent of political unrest, i.e. its vulnerability to riot, war or regime change, is directly associated with the percentage of 15- to 24-year-olds in its population.\nThey argue that communities with more than 20% of individuals in this age group run the greatest risk of more frequent and more intense political instability. They describe the phenomena as the \"youth bulge theory\", where the \"bulge\" refers to the fattening of the population pyramid just before the base of the youngest age groups.\n\nThe riots in Tottenham after the death of Mark Duggan were initially blamed on poor relations between the police and the black community. Professor Gus John has argued that the tactical use of frequent \"stop and search\", particularly of young black men, has caused resentment of the police in the black community.\n\nAccording to David Lammy, the MP for Tottenham, the \"cracks that already existed between the police and the community became deep fissures\".\n\n\"The Guardian\" Reading the Riots Survey concluded: \"Although rioters expressed a mix of opinions about the disorder, many of those involved said they felt like they were participating in explicitly anti-police riots. They cited 'policing' as the most significant cause of the riots, and anger over the police shooting of Mark Duggan, which triggered initial disturbances in Tottenham, was repeatedly mentioned – even outside London.\"\n\nRioters themselves cited exclusion as a reason for their actions. One person, asked by a journalist if rioting was really the best way to accomplish their objectives, responded: \"Yes, because if we weren’t rioting, you wouldn’t be talking to us.\"\n\nCamila Batmanghelidjh writing in \"The Independent\" blames social exclusion and social deprivation. Various journalists have identified poverty and the growing gap between rich and poor as causative factors.\n\nIn a House of Commons debate on the riots Home Secretary Theresa May stated that the riots were symptomatic of a \"wider malaise\" including worklessness, illiteracy, and drug abuse but also stated that \"Everybody, no matter what their background or circumstances, has the freedom to choose between right and wrong\". Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, writing in \"The Observer\", stated that the riots were not caused by a broken society, but due to a group of young, alienated, disaffected youth who are outside the social mainstream and who live in a culture at odds with any canons of proper behaviour; he added that this is found in virtually every developed nation.\n\nMax Hastings of the \"Daily Mail\" blamed a culture of welfare dependence.\n\nA journalist on Al Jazeera suggested a similarity to the disenfranchisement behind the Arab Spring revolutionary wave of 2011. Links were made to high youth unemployment and general disenfranchisement. A study by The \"Financial Times\" published in September 2011 found a strong link between rioting and deprivation.\n\nChristina Odone writing in \"The Daily Telegraph\" links the riots to a lack of male role models and argues that \"Like the overwhelming majority of youth offenders behind bars, these gang members have one thing in common: no father at home.\" This has been linked further with England's having the \"worst record in family breakdown in Europe\".\n\nThe spending cuts of the coalition government in the United Kingdom have also been cited as a cause. Ken Livingstone, the Labour Candidate for Mayor of London in 2012 has argued that \"The economic stagnation and cuts being imposed by the Tory government inevitably create social division.\" Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats political party, made it clear that the government's planned cuts to police budgets will go ahead.\n\nThe local government budget had been cut in the past year so Haringey Council, which includes Tottenham and Tottenham Hale, decided to close eight of its 13 youth clubs in 2011, rather than save money through increased efficiency or make cuts in other areas.\n\nScrapping of the Education Maintenance Allowance, removing of funding for courses where the student already has an equal or lower level qualification and trebling of university tuition fees, combined with high youth unemployment has placed the British youth \"between a rock and a hard place\" alienating and angering the youth population. Proponents of this argument say that Scottish youth did not riot partly because Scottish students do not have to pay tuition fees.\n\nDavid Lammy MP has said that Tottenham has the highest unemployment rate in London and the eighth highest in the United Kingdom. The number of people chasing every one job vacancy in Haringey has been put at 23 and 54 in separate reports, and fears had spread of disorder after youth club closures in recent months.\n\nHaringey, has the fourth highest level of child poverty in London and 8.8% unemployed.\n\nOther academics have pointed to more prosaic causes of the 2011 riots, citing the carnivalesque atmospheres created through the usual uses of urban space. For example, researchers from the University of Birmingham noted that ‘another sound could be heard above the mêlée, that of laughter. Above the bark of police dogs, and behind the masked and hooded faces of the throng, were smiles, laughter, and shrieks of joy.’\n\nIn a \"Newsnight\" discussion on 12 August, historian David Starkey blamed black gangster culture, saying that it had influenced youths of all races. The BBC received nearly 700 complaints about his statement that the \"whites have become black\". Cottrell-Boyce, writing in the Youth Justice journal, argued that gangs were constructed as a 'suitable enemy' by politicians and the media, obscuring the wider, structural and economic roots of youth violence.\n\nDuring the riots, on 9 August 2011, UK Home Secretary Theresa May said: \"I think this is about sheer criminality. That is what we have seen on the streets. The violence we've seen, the looting we've seen, the thuggery we've seen – this is sheer criminality, and let's make no bones about it.\" Paul Hobbs, London correspondent for One News said that looters are not politically motivated and called the riots \"recreational violence\". A Manchester rioter said to a BBC correspondent: \"Every time I go into town I just think how the shops got smashed up in 2011 by all of us, I just laugh about it every time I go back in now.\"\n\nThe BBC reported that the Chief Constable of West Midlands Police had stated that he thought that the motivation for rioters targeting the city centre was not anger, but greed.\n\n\"Daily Telegraph\" columnist Peter Oborne suggested that moral decay is just as bad at the top of society as it is at the bottom, with the rich and powerful generating anger among the British population. He cited the MPs' expenses scandal, bankers' bonuses, and the phone hacking scandal as setting poor examples. In \"The Financial Times\" cartoonist Ingram Pinn depicted a Union Flag being broken through by a looter in a hoodie carrying a stolen box of Adidas trainers, preceded by two men in suits carrying piles of cash, one saying \"MP's Expenses\" and another \"Banker's Bonus\".\n\nKenneth Clarke, the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, writing in \"The Guardian\", described the riots in part as \"an outburst of outrageous behaviour by the criminal classes\". He drew attention to the statistic that almost three-quarters of the adults who had been charged with offences related to the disorder already had a criminal record.\nClarke characterised this as the legacy of \"a broken penal system\", one that did not have a good record for preventing reoffending. He stated he is proposing radical new measures intended to focus on robust punishment and on delivering reductions in reoffending.\n\nA conference held in November 2012 and its subsequent report by Dr Leah Bassel of the University of Leicester, entitled \"Media and the Riots – A Call For Action\", examined the relationship between mainstream media and communities affected by the riots.\n\nJamie Waylett, who played Vincent Crabbe in the \"Harry Potter\" film series, was charged and sentenced for his participation in the riots. He was photographed drinking out of a bottle of stolen champagne, as well as holding a petrol bomb in Camden on the third day of rioting and violence. He was given a two-year sentence for violence and handling stolen goods. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1742933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1742933", "title": "Alligator gar", "text": "Alligator gar\n\nThe alligator gar (\"Atractosteus spatula\") is a ray-finned euryhaline fish related to the bowfin in the infraclass Holostei . It is the largest species in the gar family, and among the largest freshwater fishes in North America. The fossil record traces its existence back to the Early Cretaceous over a hundred million years ago. \n\nGars are often referred to as \"primitive fishes\", or \"living fossils\" because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their earliest ancestors, such as a spiral valve intestine which is also common to the digestive system of sharks, and the ability to breathe both air and water. Their common name was derived from their resemblance to the American alligator, particularly their broad snout and long, sharp teeth. Anecdotal evidence in several scientific reports suggest that an alligator gar can grow up to in length, but in 2011, the largest alligator gar ever caught and officially recorded was long, weighed , and was around the girth.\n\nThe body of an alligator gar is torpedo-shaped, usually brown or olive fading to a lighter gray or yellow ventral surface. Their scales are not like the scales of other fishes; rather, they are ganoid scales which are bone-like, diamond-shaped scales, often with serrated edges, and covered by an enamel-like substance. Ganoid scales are nearly impenetrable and are excellent protection against predation. Unlike other gar species, the upper jaw of an alligator gar has a dual row of large, sharp teeth which are used to impale and hold prey. Alligator gar are stalking, ambush predators, primarily piscivores, but they will also ambush and eat water fowl and small mammals they find floating on the water's surface.\n\nPopulations of alligator gar have been extirpated from much of their historic range as a result of habitat destruction, indiscriminate culling, and unrestricted harvests. Populations are now located primarily in the southern portions of the United States extending into Mexico. They are considered euryhaline because they can adapt to varying salinities ranging from freshwater lakes and swamps to brackish marshes, estuaries, and bays along the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nFor nearly a half-century, alligator gar were considered \"trash fish\", or a \"nuisance species\" detrimental to sport fisheries, so were targeted for elimination by state and federal authorities in the United States. The 1980s brought a better understanding of the ecological balance necessary to sustain an ecosystem, and eventually an awareness that alligator gar were no less important than any other living organism in the ecosystems they inhabit. Over time, alligator gar were afforded some protection by state and federal resource agencies. They are also protected under the Lacey Act which makes it illegal to transport certain species of fish in interstate commerce when in violation of state law or regulation. Several state and federal resource agencies are monitoring populations in the wild, and have initiated outreach programs to educate the public. Alligator gar are being cultured in ponds, pools, raceways, and tanks by federal hatcheries for mitigation stocking, by universities for research purposes, and in Mexico for consumption.\n\nAlligator gar are the largest species in the gar family, and among the largest freshwater fishes found in North America. Mature alligator gar commonly measure in length, and weigh over 100 lb (45 kg). However, anecdotal reports suggest they can grow up to 10 ft (3 m) in length, and weigh as much as 350 lb (159 kg). The largest alligator gar officially recorded was inadvertently caught in the net of fisherman Kenny Williams of Vicksburg, Mississippi, while he was fishing the oxbow lakes of the Mississippi River on February 14, 2011. Williams was pulling up his net on Lake Chotard expecting to find buffalo fish, but instead discovered a large alligator gar tangled in his net. The gar was long, weighed , and its girth was . According to wildlife officials, the fish was estimated to be between 50 and 70 years old; one report estimated the gar's age to be at least 95. Williams donated it to the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science in Jackson, where it will remain on display.\nAll gars have torpedo-shaped bodies, but some distinguishing characteristics of adult alligator gar include their large size; heavy bodies; broad heads; short, broad snouts; large, sharp teeth; and double row of teeth on their upper jaws. They are usually brown or olive fading to a lighter gray or yellow ventral surface. The dorsal and anal fins are positioned toward the back of their bodies, and their caudal fins are abbreviate-heterocercal, or nonsymmetrical.\n\nAlligator gar have gills, but unlike other species of fish, with few exceptions, they also have a highly vascularized swim bladder lung that supplements gill respiration. The bladder not only provides buoyancy, but also enables them to breathe in air, which is why they are able to inhabit bodies of water in which most other fishes would die of suffocation. The swim bladder is connected to their fore gut by a small pneumatic duct which allows them to breathe or gulp air when they break the surface, an action seen quite frequently on lakes in the Southern United States during the hot summer.\n\nThe scales of alligator gar are not like the scales of other fishes which have flexible elasmoid scales; their bodies are protected by inflexible and articulated ganoid scales that are diamond-shaped, often with serrated edges, and composed of a tough inner layer of bone and hard outer layer of ganoin which is essentially homologous to tooth enamel, making them nearly impenetrable.\n\nLacépède first described the alligator gar in 1803. The original name was \"Lepisosteus spatula\", but was later changed by E.O. Wiley in 1976 to \"Atractosteus spatula\" to recognize two distinct taxa of gars. Synonyms of \"Atractosteus spatula\" include \"Lesisosteus\" [sic] \"ferox\" (Rafinesque 1820), and \"Lepisosteus spatula\" (Lacepede 1803). Fossils from the order Lepisosteiformes have been collected in Europe from the Cretaceous to Oligocene periods, in Africa and India from the Cretaceous, and in North America from the Cretaceous to recent times. The Lepisosteidae are the only extant family of gars which has seven species, all located in North and Central America. The fossil record traces the existence of alligator gar back to the Early Cretaceous over a hundred million years ago. Despite being a highly evolved species, alligator gar are often referred to as \"primitive fishes\", or \"living fossils\" because they have retained a few morphological characteristics of their earliest ancestors with seemingly few to no apparent changes, such as a spiral valve intestine which is also common to the digestive system of sharks, an abbreviate-heterocercal tail, and a swim bladder lung for breathing in both air and water.\n\nAlligator gar are relatively passive, seemingly sluggish solitary fish, but voracious ambush predators. They are opportunistic night predators and are primarily piscivores, but they also ambush and eat water fowl and small mammals that may be floating on the surface. Their method of ambush is to float a few feet below the surface, and wait for unsuspecting prey to swim within reach. They lunge forward, and with a sweeping motion, grab their prey, impaling it on their double rows of sharp teeth.\n\nDiet studies have shown alligator gar to be opportunistic piscivores, and even scavengers depending on the availability of their preferred food source. They occasionally ingest sport fish, but the majority of stomach content studies suggest they feed predominately on forage fishes such as gizzard shad and invertebrates and water fowl. Diet studies have also revealed fishing tackle and boat-engine parts in their stomachs.\n\nAs with most ancestral species, alligator gar are long-lived, and sexually late maturing. Most females do not reach sexual maturity until after their first decade of life, while males reach sexual maturity in half that time. The conditions must be precise for a successful spawning to occur. Preparation for spawning begins in the spring with the extended photoperiod and rising water temperatures, but flooding is also necessary to trigger the event. When rivers rise and spread over the floodplain, they create oxbow lakes and sloughs, and inundate terrestrial vegetation, which in turn provides protection and a nutrient-rich habitat for larval fish and fry. Once the water temperature has reached , and all the other criteria are met, gar move into the grassy, weed-laden shallows to spawn.\n\nActual spawning occurs when males gather around gravid females, and begin writhing, twisting, bumping into and slithering over the tops of females, an activity which triggers the release of eggs. Males release clouds of milt to fertilize the eggs as they are released into the water column. The sticky eggs then attach to submerged vegetation, and development begins. Only a few days are needed for the eggs to hatch into larval fish, and another 10 days or so for the larval fish to detach from the vegetation and start moving about as young fry. Egg production is variable, and believed to be dependent on the size of the female. A common formula used for predicting the volume of eggs a female can produce is 4.1 eggs/gram of body weight, which gives an average of about 150,000 eggs per spawn. The eggs of alligator gar are bright red and poisonous to humans if ingested.\n\nAlligator gar inhabit a wide variety of aquatic habitats, but most are found in the Southern United States in reservoirs and lakes, in the backwaters of lowland rivers, and in the brackish waters of estuaries, bayous, and bays. They have occasionally been seen in the Gulf of Mexico. In Texas and Louisiana, large gars are commonly seen breaking the surface in reservoirs, bayous, and brackish marshes. They are found throughout the lower Mississippi River Valley and Gulf Coast states of the Southern United States and Mexico as far south as Veracruz, encompassing these states: Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Florida, and Georgia. Reports suggest alligator gar were once numerous throughout much of their northern range, but valid sightings today are rare, and may occur once every few years. Records of historical distribution indicate alligator gar once inhabited regions as far north as central Kansas, Nebraska, Ohio, Iowa, and west-central Illinois, where they are now listed as extirpated. The most northerly verified catch was in Meredosia, Illinois, in 1922. Now, efforts to reintroduce alligator gar between Tennessee and Illinois are being made as part of an effort to control invasive Asian carp.\n\nA few notable sightings of alligator gar have been reported outside North America. In November 2008, a\nbroadhead gar, genus \"Atractosteus\", measuring was caught in the Caspian Sea north of Esenguly, Turkmenistan, by two officials of Turkmenistan Fishery Protection. Its species is unconfirmed, but is believed to be an alligator gar.\n\nOn September 4, 2009, a alligator gar was found in Tak Wah Park in Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong. Over the next two days, at least 16 other alligator gar, the largest measuring , were found in ponds in public parks in Hong Kong. Nearby residents reported the alligator gar had been released into the ponds by aquarium hobbyists, and had lived there for several years. However, after a complaint made by a citizen who falsely identified alligator gar as crocodiles, the use of terms like \"horrible man-eating fish\" had begun appearing in the headlines of some major local newspapers. Officials with Leisure and Cultural Services in Tak Wah Park removed all the alligator gar from the ponds because they were concerned the large, carnivorous fish might harm children. Not unusually, the large, sharp teeth and outward appearance of alligator gar can precipitate unreasonable fear in those unfamiliar with the species. Sensationalized reports have contributed to the misconception of predatory attacks by alligator gar on humans, though none of the reports has been confirmed.\n\nOn January 21, 2011, an alligator gar measuring was caught in a canal in Pasir Ris, Singapore, by two recreational fishermen. The fish was taken to a nearby pond, where the owner confirmed it was an alligator gar rather than an arapaima as the men had initially thought.\n\nAnecdotal reports have been made of alligator gar captured in various parts of India, but are believed to be the result of incidental releases by aquarium hobbyists and the like. In August 2015, an alligator gar was found entangled in cloth inside a well in Dadar, where it had been living for quite some time. It was rescued by animal activists and returned to the well unharmed. In June 2016, a 3.5 ft Alligator Gar was caught from Subhash Sarovar Lake in Kolkata. Other incidents over the years have been random, ranging from captures in coastal waters during environmental assessments to captures in private ponds.\n\nNative Americans in the south, and Caribbean peoples used the alligator gar's ganoid scales for arrow heads, breastplates, and as shielding to cover plows. Early settlers tanned the skins to make a strong, durable leather to cover their wooden plows, and make purses and various other items. Gar oil was also used by the people of Arkansas as a repellent for buffalo gnats.\n\nFor nearly half a century, alligator gar were considered \"trash fish\", or \"nuisance species\" by state and federal authorities who targeted them for elimination to protect gamefish populations, and to prevent alleged attacks on humans, a claim that remains unsubstantiated with the exception of occasional injuries sustained from captured alligator gar thrashing around on the decks of boats. Fishermen participated in the slaughter of thousands of alligator gar believing they were providing a great service. In 1992, PBS affiliate KUHT channel 8, became the presenting station for a public outreach program that documented the life history cycle of alligator gar titled \"The Alligator Gar: Predator or Prey?\". It was the first documentary ever produced and televised nationally about alligator gar at a time when it was still being referred to as a trash fish. The half-hour program ran for 3 years as part of an educational series titled, \"Exotic and Unusual Fishes\", produced by Earthwave Society. It first aired in primetime during the 1992 July sweeps, and drew a 2.8 rating/4 share, making it the number-one rated program of the evening for PBS. A decade passed before any significant action was taken to protect and preserve the remaining populations of alligator gar in the United States. Among the first to enact restoration and management practices was the Missouri Department of Conservation in partnership with Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, Illinois, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.\n\nThe long-time public perception of alligator gar as trash fish or a nuisance species has changed, with increasing national and international attention on the species as a sport fish, which some have attributed to features on popular television shows. Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana allow regulated sport fishing of alligator gar. Texas has one of the best remaining fisheries for alligator gar, and in concert with its efforts to maintain a viable fishery, imposed a one-per-day bag limit on them in 2009. The Texas state record, and world record for the largest alligator gar caught on rod and reel, is , taken by Bill Valverde on January 1, 1951, on the Rio Grande in Texas. Alligator gar are also quite popular among bowfishers because of their large size, trophy potential, and fighting ability. The Texas state bowfishing record was set in 2001 by Marty McClellan with a alligator gar from the Trinity River. The all-tackle record was a alligator gar caught on a trotline in 1953 by T.C. Pierce, Jr. In 1991, fishing guide Kirk Kirkland anecdotally reported catching an alligator gar measuring on rod and line from the Trinity River.\n\nDeclining populations of alligator gar throughout their historic range has resulted in the need to monitor wild populations and regulate commercial harvests. Alligator gar have a high yield of white meat filets and a small percentage of waste relative to body weight. The meat is sold to wholesale distributors, and also sold retail by a few supermarkets with prices starting at around $3.00/lb. Fried gar balls, grilled fillets, and filets boiled in water with crab boil seasoning are popular dishes in the south. Also, a small cottage industry makes jewelry out of ganoid scales, and tans gar hides to produce leather for making lamp shades, purses, and a host of novelty items.\n\n\"Atractosteus\" gars, including alligator gar, tropical gars, and Cuban gars are considered good candidates for aquaculture, particularly in developing regions, where their rapid growth, disease resistance, easy adaptation to artificial feeds as juveniles, and ability to tolerate low water quality are essential. Their ability to breathe in both air and water eliminates the need for costly aeration systems and other technology commonly used in aquaculture. In the Southern United States, as well as in parts of Mexico and Cuba, broodstocks have already been established, and are being maintained in their respective regions where they already are a popular food fish.\n\nDespite the large size alligator gar can attain, they are kept as aquarium fish, though many fish labeled as \"alligator gar\" in the aquarium trade are actually smaller species. Alligator gar require a very large aquarium or pond, and ample resources for them to thrive in captivity. They are also a popular fish for public aquaria, and zoos. In many areas, keeping alligator gar as pets is illegal, but they occasionally show up in fish stores. Alligator gar are highly prized and sought after for private aquaria, particularly in Japan. According to some reports, large alligator gar could fetch as much as US$40,000 in what some consider the \"Japanese black market\". In June 2011, three men from Florida and Louisiana were indicted on charges of illegally removing wild alligator gar from the Trinity River in Texas, and attempting to ship them to Japan for private collectors. The indictments resulted from an undercover sting operation by special agents with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The charges included violations of three separate provisions of the Lacey Act, specifically conspiracy to submit a false label for fish transported in interstate commerce; conspiracy to transport fish in interstate commerce in violation of state law or regulation; and conspiracy to transport and sell fish in interstate commerce in violation of state law or regulation. Two of the conspirators entered guilty pleas to one count, and the government dropped the other two charges against them. A third conspirator went to trial on all three counts, was acquitted on one count, and found guilty on two. The district court sentenced him to serve nine months in prison followed by one year of supervised release. The case was appealed, and on April 15, 2014, the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the district court.\n\n"}
{"id": "1962117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962117", "title": "Ars moriendi", "text": "Ars moriendi\n\nThe Ars moriendi (\"The Art of Dying\") are two related Latin texts dating from about 1415 and 1450 which offer advice on the protocols and procedures of a good death, explaining how to \"die well\" according to Christian precepts of the late Middle Ages. It was written within the historical context of the effects of the macabre horrors of the Black Death 60 years earlier and consequent social upheavals of the 15th century. It was very popular, translated into most West European languages, and was the first in a western literary tradition of guides to death and dying. About 50,000 copies were printed in the \"incunabula\" period before 1501.\n\nThere was originally a \"long version\" and a later \"short version\" containing eleven woodcut pictures as instructive images which could be easily explained and memorized.\n\nThe authors of the two texts are unknown, but assumed to be Dominican churchmen, as they echo Jean de Gerson's publication, the \"Opusculum Tripartitu\", containing a section named \"De arte Moriendi\". Gerson may have been influenced by earlier references in 'compendia of faith' dating back to the thirteenth century, but the content was uniquely his own.\nThe original \"long version\", called \"Tractatus\" (or \"Speculum\") \"artis bene moriendi\", was composed in 1415 by an anonymous Dominican friar, probably at the request of the Council of Constance (1414–1418, Germany). This was widely read and translated into most West European languages, and was very popular in England, where a tradition of consolatory death literature survived until the 17th century. Works in the English tradition include \"The Way of Dying Well\" and \"The Sick Mannes Salve\". In 1650, \"Holy Living and Holy Dying\" became the \"artistic climax\" of the tradition that had begun with \"Ars moriendi\".\n\n\"Ars Moriendi\" was also among the first books printed with movable type and was widely circulated in nearly 100 editions before 1500, in particular in Germany. The long version survives in about 300 manuscript versions, only one illustrated.\n\n\"Ars moriendi\" consists of six chapters:\n\n\nThe \"short version\", whose appearance shortly precedes the introduction in the 1460s of block books (books printed from carved blocks of wood, both text and images on the same block), first dates to around 1450, from the Netherlands. It is mostly an adaptation of the second chapter of the \"long version\", and contains eleven woodcut pictures. The first ten woodcuts are divided into 5 pairs, with each set showing a picture of the devil presenting one of the 5 temptations, and the second picture showing the proper remedy for that temptation. The last woodcut shows the dying man, presumably having successfully navigated the maze of temptations, being accepted into heaven, and the devils going back to hell in confusion.\n\nThe \"short version\" was as popular as the \"long version\", but there was no English translation, perhaps because educated English people at the time were expected to understand several European languages. There are six extant manuscripts of the short version, most not illustrated, and over twenty extant blockbook illustrated editions, using 13 different sets of blocks.\n\nAs well as the eleven different sets of blockbook woodcuts, there is a set by Master E. S. in engraving. The lengthy controversy over their respective dating and priority is now resolved by the discovery by Fritz Saxl of an earlier illuminated manuscript, of well before 1450, from whose tradition all the images in the printed versions clearly derive. Studies of the watermarks of the blockbooks by Allen Stevenson at the British Museum in the 1960s confirmed that none of them predated the 1460s, so Master E. S.' engravings are the earliest printed versions, dating from around 1450. The images remain largely the same in all media for the rest of the century.\n\nThere is the exceptional number of about seventy incunabulum editions, in a variety of languages, from Catalan to Dutch, the earliest from about 1474 from Cologne.\n\nAllegorically the images depicted the contest between angels and demons over the fate of the dying man. In his dying agony his soul emerges from his mouth to be received by one of a band of angels.\nCommon themes portrayed by illustrators include skeletons, the Last Judgement, corpses, and the forces of good and evil battling over souls.\n\nThe popularity of the \"Ars moriendi\" texts developed into a broader tradition of writing on the good death. Jeremy Taylor's books \"Holy Living and Holy Dying\", published in 1650 and 1651, exemplify that tradition. It developed in both Protestant and Catholic veins and continued in various forms through the nineteenth century.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1497599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1497599", "title": "Ashikaga Tadayoshi", "text": "Ashikaga Tadayoshi\n\nThe Ashikaga were a samurai family from Kamakura having blood ties with the Seiwa Genji, Minamoto no Yoritomo's clan. Unlike his brother Takauji, Tadayoshi took no part in the Kamakura shogunate's political activities until the Genkō War (1331–1333), a civil war whose conclusion (the Siege of Kamakura (1333)) marks the end of the Kamakura period and the beginning of the most turbulent period in Japan's history, the Muromachi era.\n\nLike his brother, Tadayoshi resolutely abandoned the Kamakura shogunate to ally himself with Emperor Go-Daigo during the Kenmu Restoration of 1333. When Go-Daigo had ascended to the throne in 1318, he had immediately manifested his intention to rule without interference from the military in Kamakura. The samurai class as a whole however was not ready to give away power, so the alliance between him and the Ashikaga was bound to be only temporary.\n\nGo-Daigo wanted to re-establish his rule in Kamakura and the east of the country without sending there a \"shōgun\", as this was seen, just a year from the fall of its shogunate, as still too dangerous. As a compromise, he sent his six-year-old son Prince Norinaga to Mutsu Province and nominated him Governor-General of the Mutsu and Dewa Provinces. In an obvious reply to this move, Tadayoshi, without an order from the Emperor escorted another of his sons, eleven-year-old Prince Nariyoshi (a.k.a. Narinaga) to Kamakura, where he installed him as governor of the Kōzuke Province with himself as a deputy and de facto ruler. The appointment of a warrior to such an important post was intended to show the Emperor that the samurai class was not ready for a purely civilian rule. Since he ruled without interference from Kyoto and the area in itself was in effect a miniature shogunate, this event can be considered the beginning of the Ashikaga shogunate.\n\nIn 1335, during the Nakasendai Rebellion led by Hōjō Tokiyuki Tadayoshi, being unable to defend the city, had to leave Kamakura in a rush. Not being in the position to take along another son of Go-Daigo's, Prince Morinaga, whom he had kept as a hostage for several months, rather than letting him go he decided to have him beheaded.\n\nIn Dec. 1335, Tadayoshi was defeated by imperial forces under the command of Nitta Yoshisada forcing his retreat to the Hakone mountains. However, with the aid of his brother Takauji, they were able to defeat Yoshisada at the battles of Sanoyama and Mishima. The brothers were then free to advance upon Kyoto.\n\nTheir occupation of Kyoto was short lived however, as forces loyal to Go-Daigo forced the brothers to flee west. In April 1336, Ashikaga Tadayoshi, \"drove the enemy before him\" helping his brother defeat the Kikuchi clan, allies of Go-Daigo. This Battle of Tatarahama (1336) occurred in Hakata Bay. The victory enabled Takauji to become master of Kyushu.\n\nBy May, Takauji was able to advance with a flotilla, reaching the environs of present-day Kobe in July. Tadayoshi followed in parallel with a land force.\n\nTurning against Go-Daigo, Tadayoshi and Takauji set up a rival emperor in 1336 after defeating the Loyalists in the Battle of Minatogawa. Their Muromachi shogunate was founded in 1338.\n\nDividing power between them, Takauji took charge of military affairs and Tadayoshi of judicial and administrative matters.\n\nBoth Tadayoshi and Takauji were disciples of famous Zen master, intellectual and garden designer Musō Soseki, under which guidance the first would later become a Buddhist monk. It was partly because of Soseki's influence that the pre-existing Five Mountain System network of Zen temples was expanded and strengthened, first with the establishment of the Jissetsu, and later with that of the Ankoku-ji temple sub-networks. The creation of both systems is generally attributed wholly to Tadayoshi. It was also Soseki which famously wrote about the two brothers, describing Takauji as more apt to military pursuits, and Tadayoshi to government.\n\nAshikaga Takauji was the formally-appointed shogun but, having proved incapable of ruling the country, for more than ten years Tadayoshi had governed in his stead. The relationship between the two brothers was however destined to be destroyed by the Kannō disturbance, an event which takes its name from the Kannō era (1350–1351) during which it took place, and which had very serious consequences for the entire country. Trouble between the two started when Takauji made Kō no Moronao his deputy \"shōgun\". According to the Taiheiki, Tadayoshi didn't like Moronao and, every other effort to get rid of him having failed, tried to have him assassinated. According to the same source, his plot was discovered and he was therefore removed from the government. In any event, Tadayoshi in 1350 was forced by Moronao to leave the government, and take the tonsure under the monastic name Keishin.\n\nIn 1351 Tadayoshi rebelled and joined his brother's enemies, the Southern court, whose emperor, Go-Murakami appointed him general of all his troops. In 1351 he defeated Takauji, occupied Kyoto, and entered Kamakura. During the same year his forces killed Moronao and his brother Moroyasu at Mikage (Settsu Province). The following year Tadayoshi's fortunes turned and he was defeated by Takauji at Sattayama. A reconciliation between the brothers proved to be brief; Tadayoshi was sandwiched by two of Takauji's armies and fled to the hills of Izu in 1352. Shortly after an ostensible second reconciliation, Tadayoshi was captured and confined in the Kamakura Jomyoji monastery, where he died suddenly in March. According to the Taiheiki, by poisoning.\n\nAshikaga Tadayoshi was buried at , a Buddhist temple which no longer exists, but whose ruins are now near Jōmyō-ji in Kamakura. The temple was founded on the grounds of Tadayoshi's former Kamakura residence, according to Jōmyō-ji's own records by Tadayoshi himself. According to the , the diary of priest Gidō Shūshin, in 1372 on the day of Tadayoshi's death Kamakura's Kubō Ashikaga Ujimitsu visited Daikyū-ji. The date of disappearance of the temple is unknown. He adopted Takauji is son as his Adopted son, Ashikaga Tadafuyu.\n\n\n\n"}

It followed an Irish Republican Army (IRA) ambush of a British Auxiliary patrol in the city, which wounded twelve Auxiliaries, one fatally. In retaliation, the Auxiliaries, Black and Tans and British soldiers looted and burnt numerous buildings in the city centre. Many civilians reported being beaten, shot at, and robbed by British forces. Firefighters testified that British forces hindered their attempts to tackle the blazes through intimidation, cutting their hoses and shooting at them.\n\nMore than 40 business premises, 300 residential properties, the City Hall and Carnegie Library were destroyed by the fire. Over £3 million worth of damage (equivalent to €172 million today) was wrought, 2,000 were left jobless and many more became homeless. Two unarmed IRA volunteers were shot dead in the north of the city.\n\nBritish forces carried out other reprisals on Irish civilians during the war, but the burning of Cork was one of the most significant. The British government at first denied that its forces had started the fires, and blamed the IRA. Later, a British Army inquiry concluded that a company of Auxiliaries were responsible.\n\nThe Irish War of Independence began in 1919, following the declaration of an Irish Republic and its parliament, Dáil Éireann. The army of the new republic, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), waged guerrilla warfare against British forces: the British Army and the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). To help fight the IRA, the British Government formed the Auxiliary Division; a paramilitary unit composed of ex-soldiers from Britain which specialized in counter-insurgency. It also recruited thousands of British ex-soldiers into the RIC, who became known as \"Black and Tans\". IRA intelligence officer Florence O'Donoghue claimed the subsequent burning and looting of Cork was \"not an isolated incident, but rather the large-scale application of a policy initiated and approved, implicitly or explicitly, by the British government\".\nCounty Cork was an epicenter of the war. On 23 November 1920, a \"Black and Tan\" in civilian dress threw a grenade into a group of IRA volunteers who had just left a brigade meeting on St Patrick Street in Cork. Three IRA volunteers of the 1st Cork Brigade were killed: Paddy Trahey, Patrick Donohue and Seamus Mehigan. \"The New York Times\" reported that sixteen people were injured.\n\nOn 28 November 1920, the IRA's 3rd Cork Brigade ambushed an Auxiliary patrol at Kilmichael, killing 17 Auxiliaries. This was the biggest loss of life for the British in County Cork. On 10 December, British forces declared martial law in counties Cork (including the city), Kerry, Limerick, and Tipperary. It also imposed a military curfew on Cork city, which began at 10 each night. IRA volunteer Seán Healy later recalled that \"at least 1,000 troops would pour out of Victoria Barracks at this hour and take over complete control of the city\".\n\nIRA intelligence established that an Auxiliary patrol usually left Victoria Barracks (in the north of the city) each night at 8 and made its way to the city centre via Dillon's Cross. On 11 December, IRA commander Seán O'Donoghue received intelligence that two lorries of Auxiliaries would be leaving the barracks that night and travelling with them would be British Army Intelligence Corps Captain James Kelly. \n\nThat evening, a unit of six IRA volunteers commanded by O'Donoghue took up position between the barracks and Dillon's Cross. Their goal was to destroy the patrol and capture or kill Captain Kelly. Five of the volunteers hid behind a stone wall while one, Michael Kenny, stood across the road dressed as an off-duty British officer. When the lorries neared he was to beckon the driver of the first lorry to slow down or stop. The neighbourhood was close (within a \"couple of hundred yards\") of a military barracks.\n\nAt 8, two lorries each carrying 13 Auxiliaries emerged from the barracks. The first lorry slowed when the driver spotted Kenny and, as it did so, the IRA unit attacked with grenades and revolvers. The official British report said that 12 members of the Auxiliary Division were wounded and that one, Temporary Cadet Spencer Chapman, a former Officer in the 4th Battalion London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers), died from his wounds shortly after. As the IRA unit made its escape, some of the Auxiliaries managed to fire their rifles in the direction of the volunteers while others dragged the wounded to the nearest cover: O'Sullivan's pub.\n\nThe Auxiliaries broke into the pub with weapons drawn. They ordered everyone to put their hands over their heads to be searched. Backup and an ambulance were sent from the nearby barracks. One witness described a number of young men being rounded-up and forced to lie on the ground. The Auxiliaries dragged one of them to the middle of the crossroads, stripped him naked and forced him to sing \"God Save the King\" until he collapsed on the road.\n\nAngered by an attack so near their headquarters and seeking retribution for the deaths of their colleagues at Kilmichael, the Auxiliaries gathered to wreak their revenge. Charles Schulze, a member of the Auxiliaries and a former British Army Captain in the Dorsetshire Regiment during World War I, organized a group of Auxiliaries to burn the centre of Cork.\n\nAt 9:30, lorries of Auxiliaries and British soldiers left the barracks and alighted at Dillon's Cross, where they broke into a number of houses and herded the occupants on to the street. They then set the houses on fire and stood guard as they were razed to the ground. Those who tried to intervene were fired upon and some were badly beaten. Seven buildings were set alight at the crossroads. When one was found to be owned by Protestants, the Auxiliaries quickly doused the fire.\n\nAt about the same time, a group of armed and uniformed Auxiliaries surrounded a tram at Summerhill, smashed its windows, and forced all the passengers out. A number of the passengers (including at least three women) were repeatedly kicked, hit with rifle butts, threatened, and verbally abused. The Auxiliaries then forced the passengers to line-up against a wall and searched them, while continuing the physical and verbal abuse. Some had their money and belongings stolen. Another tram was set alight near Father Mathew's statue. Meanwhile, witnesses reported seeing a group of 14–18 Black and Tans firing wildly for upwards of 20 minutes on nearby MacCurtain Street.\n\nSoon after, witnesses reported groups of armed men on St Patrick's Street, the city's main shopping area. Some were uniformed or partially uniformed members of the Auxiliaries and British Army while others wore no uniforms. They were seen firing into the air, smashing shop windows and setting buildings alight. Many reported hearing bombs exploding. A group of Auxiliaries were seen throwing a bomb into the ground floor of the Munster Arcade, which housed both shops and flats. It exploded under the residential quarters while people were inside the building. They managed to escape unharmed but were detained by the Auxiliaries.\nThe fire brigade was informed of the fire at Dillon's Cross shortly before 10 pm and were sent to deal with it at once. However, on finding that Grant's department store on St Patrick's Street was ablaze, they decided to tackle it first. The fire brigade's Superintendent, Alfred Hutson, called Victoria Barracks and asked them to tackle the fire at Dillon's Cross so that he could focus on the city centre. However, the barracks took no heed of his request. As he did not have enough resources to deal with all the fires at once, \"he would have to make choices – some fires he would fight, others he could not\".\n\nHutson oversaw the operation on St Patrick's Street, and met \"Cork Examiner\" reporter Alan Ellis. He told Ellis \"that all the fires were being deliberately started by incendiary bombs, and in several cases he had seen soldiers pouring cans of petrol into buildings and setting them alight\". \n\nA number of firemen later testified that British forces hindered their attempts to tackle the blazes by intimidating them, cutting their hoses and/or driving lorries over the hoses. They also said that firemen were shot at and that at least two were wounded by gunfire. Shortly after 3, \"Cork Examiner\" reporter Alan Ellis came upon a unit of the fire brigade pinned down by gunfire near City Hall. The firemen said that they were being shot at by Black and Tans who had broken into the building. They also claimed to have seen uniformed men carrying cans of petrol into the building from nearby Union Quay barracks. \n\nAt about 4 a large explosion was heard and City Hall and the neighbouring Carnegie Library went up in flames, resulting in the loss of many of the city's public records. When more firefighters arrived, British forces fired at them and refused them access to water. The last act of arson took place at about 6 when a group of policemen looted and burnt the Murphy Brothers' clothes shop on Washington Street.\n\nAfter the ambush at Dillon's Cross, IRA commander Seán O'Donoghue and volunteer James O'Mahony made their way to the Delaney farmhouse at Dublin Hill in the north of the city. Brothers Cornelius and Jeremiah Delaney were members of F Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Cork Brigade IRA.\n\nO'Donoghue hid a number of unused grenades on the farm and the two men went their separate ways. At about 2 at least eight armed men entered the house and went upstairs into the brothers' bedroom. The brothers got up and stood at the bedside and were asked their names. When they answered, the gunmen opened fire. Both brothers were shot dead and their elderly relative, William Dunlea, was wounded by gunfire. According to Daniel Delaney, the father of the brothers, the gunmen wore long overcoats and spoke with English accents. It is thought that, while searching the site of the ambush, the Auxiliaries had found a cap belonging to one of the volunteers and had used bloodhounds to follow the scent to the Delaney home.\n\nOver 40 business premises and 300 residential properties had been destroyed. This amounted to over five acres of the city. Over £3 million worth of damage (1920 value) was suffered, although the value of property looted by British forces was not clear. Many people became homeless and 2,000 were left jobless. Fatalities included an Auxiliary killed by the IRA, two IRA volunteers killed by Auxiliaries, and a woman who died from a heart-attack when Auxiliaries burst into her house. A number of people, including firefighters, had reportedly been assaulted or otherwise wounded.\n\nFlorence O'Donoghue, intelligence officer of the 1st Cork Brigade IRA at the time, described the scene in Cork on the morning of the 12th:\"Many familiar landmarks were gone forever – where whole buildings had collapsed here and there a solitary wall leaned at some crazy angle from its foundation. The streets ran with sooty water, the footpaths were strewn with broken glass and debris, ruins smoked and smoldered and over everything was the all-pervasive smell of burning.\"\n\nAt midday mass in the North Cathedral the Bishop of Cork, Daniel Cohalan, condemned the arson but said the burning of the city was a result of the \"murderous ambush at Dillon's Cross\" and vowed, \"I will certainly issue a decree of excommunication against anyone who, after this notice, shall take part in an ambush or a kidnapping or attempted murder or arson\". No excommunications, however, were issued, and the bishop's edict was largely ignored by pro-IRA priests and chaplains.\n\nA meeting of Cork Corporation was held that afternoon at the Corn Exchange. Councillor J.J. Walsh condemned the bishop for his comments, which he claimed held the Irish people up as the \"evil-doers\". Walsh said that while the people of Cork had been suffering, \"not a single word of protest was uttered [by the bishop], and today, after the city has been decimated, he saw no better course than to add insult to injury\". Councillor Michael Ó Cuill, alderman Tadhg Barry and the Lord Mayor, Daniel O'Callaghan, agreed with Walsh's sentiments. The members resolved that the Lord Mayor should send a telegram asking for the intervention of the European governments and the USA.\n\nThree days after the fire, on 15 December, two lorry-loads of Auxiliaries were travelling from Dunmanway to Cork for the funeral of Spencer Chapman, a comrade killed at Dillon's Cross. When they met two men (an elderly priest, Canon Magner, walking with a parishioner, a farmer's son) helping a resident magistrate fix his car, an Auxiliary, Vernon Anwyl Hart, got out and began questioning them, then shot Magner and his companion, Timothy (or Tadhg) Crowley. Both died of their injuries. A military court of inquiry heard that he had been a friend of Chapman and had been \"drinking steadily\" since his death. Hart was found guilty of murder, but insane. At a subsequent investigation, one of the reasons given for his murder was that he refused to have the parish church bells tolled after the Kilmichael ambush, in which 17 Auxiliaries were killed.\n\nIrish nationalists called for an open and impartial inquiry. In the British House of Commons, Sir Hamar Greenwood, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, refused demands for such an inquiry. He denied that British forces had any involvement and accused the IRA of starting the fires. When asked about reports of firefighters being hampered by British forces he said \"Every available policeman and soldier in Cork was turned out at once and without their assistance the fire brigade could not have gone through the crowds and did the work that they tried to do\".\n\nBonar Law said \"in the present condition of Ireland, we are much more likely to get an impartial inquiry in a military court than in any other\". The British military launched its own inquiry, the \"Strickland Report\", but Cork Corporation instructed its employees and other corporate officials to take no part. The report pointed the finger of blame at members of the Auxiliaries' K Company, based at Victoria Barracks. The Auxiliaries, it was claimed, set the fires in reprisal for the IRA attack at Dillon's Cross. However, the British Government refused to publish the report.\n\nThe Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress published a pamphlet in January 1921 entitled \"Who burned Cork City?\" The work drew on evidence from hundreds of eyewitness which suggested that the fires had been set by British forces and that British forces had prevented firefighters from tackling the blaze. The material was compiled by the President of University College Cork, Alfred O'Rahilly.\n\nK Company Auxiliary Charles Schulze, a former British Army Captain, wrote in a letter to his girlfriend in England that it was \"sweet revenge\", while in a letter to his mother he wrote: \"Many who had witnessed scenes in France and Flanders say that nothing they had experienced was comparable with the punishment meted out in Cork\". After the fire, K Company was moved to Dunmanway and began wearing burnt corks in their caps in reference to the burning of the city. For their part in the arson and looting, K Company was disbanded on 31 March 1921.\n\nThere has been debate over whether British forces at Victoria Barracks had planned to burn the city before the ambush at Dillon's Cross, whether the British Army itself was involved, and whether those who set the fires were being commanded by superior officers. Florence O'Donoghue, who was intelligence officer of the 1st Cork Brigade IRA at the time, wrote:\"What appears more probable is that the ambush provided the excuse for an act which was long premeditated and for which all arrangements had been made. The rapidity with which supplies of petrol and Verey lights were brought from Cork barracks to the centre of the city, and the deliberate manner in which the work of firing the various premises was divided amongst groups under the control of officers, gives evidence of organisation and pre-arrangement.

Kunigunde died from complications of the birth. George of Poděbrady eventually remarried; his second wife, Joanna of Rožmitál, bore George more children, including Ludmila of Poděbrady.\n\nMatthias Corvinus had lost his fiancée, Elisabeth of Cilli, at a young age. On 1 May 1463 he married Catherine at Matthias Church in Buda. Matthias was eighteen, his bride thirteen. The wedding negotiations had begun in 1458 when Catherine was nine years old. It was agreed that George would make Matthias King of Bohemia if he married Catherine. Soon after the marriage, Catherine left her family and went to live in Hungary with her new husband. Janus Pannonius helped teach Catherine Latin.\n\nThe queen was very young, so she played little part in the politics of her husband's two kingdoms. She died in childbirth at the age of 14. Her child died soon after birth as well. The event caused Matthias to lose hope of siring a legitimate heir.

A multicellular organism may contain a number of widely differing and specialized cell types, such as muscle cells and skin cells in humans, that differ both in appearance and function yet are genetically identical. Cells are able to be of the same genotype, but different cell type due to the differential regulation of the genes they contain. Classification of a specific cell type is often done through the use of microscopy (such as those from the cluster of differentiation family that are commonly used for this purpose in immunology). Recent developments in single cell RNA sequencing facilitated classification of cell types based on shared gene expression patterns. This has led to the discovery of many new cell types in e.g. mouse cortex, hippocampus, dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord.\n\nAnimals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a multicellular body (100–150 different cell types), compared\nwith 10–20 in plants, fungi, and protoctists.\n\nAll higher multicellular organisms contain cells specialised for different functions. Most distinct cell types arise from a single totipotent cell that differentiates into hundreds of different cell types during the course of development. Differentiation of cells is driven by different environmental cues (such as cell–cell interaction) and intrinsic differences (such as those caused by the uneven distribution of molecules during division). Multicellular organisms are composed of cells that fall into two fundamental types: germ cells and somatic cells. During development, somatic cells will become more specialized and form the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. After formation of the three germ layers, cells will continue to specialize until they reach a terminally differentiated state that is much more resistant to changes in cell type than its progenitors.\n\nA list of cell types in the human body may include several hundred distinct types depending on the source.\n\n\n\n"}

Zoologist, author and surrealist painter, Desmond Morris, first observed his abilities when the chimp was offered a pencil and paper at two years of age. By the age of four, Congo had made 400 drawings and paintings. His style has been described as \"lyrical abstract impressionism\".\n\nCongo was born in 1954. He learned to draw near the age of two, beginning when zoologist Desmond Morris offered Congo a pencil. Morris said, \"He took a pencil and I placed a piece of card in front of him. This is how I recorded it at the time, 'Something strange was coming out of the end of the pencil. It was Congo's first line. It wandered a short way and then stopped. Would it happen again? Yes, it did, and again and again'.\" Morris soon observed that the chimp would draw circles, and had a basic sense of composition in his drawings. He also showed the ability of symmetrical consistency between two sides of a sketch; when Morris drew a shape at one side of a piece of paper, Congo would balance the structure by making marks on the other half of the paper. Similarly, if a color on one side contained blue for example, he would add blue to the other side as well to keep balance.\n\nHe soon began painting; the patterns he made were never distinguished, pictorial images, but usually of a vague \"radiating fan pattern\" in the abstract impressionism style. Between the ages of two and four, he produced about 400 drawings and paintings.\n\nThrough that time, Congo developed a familiarity with his routine painting sessions with Morris. When a picture was taken away that he didn't consider complete, Congo would reportedly begin to scream and \"throw fits\". Also, if the ape considered one of his drawings to be finished, he would refuse to continue painting even if someone tried to persuade him to do so.\n\nIn the late 1950s, he made appearances on the British television show Zootime, which was presented live from the London Zoo by Desmond Morris. He died at ten years of age in 1964 of tuberculosis.\n\nMedia reaction to Congo's painting abilities were mixed, although relatively positive and accepted with interest. Spanish painter Pablo Picasso was reportedly a \"fan\" of his paintings, and hung one of the ape's pictures on his studio wall after receiving it as a gift.\n\nOn June 20, 2005, Congo's paintings were included in an auction at Bonhams alongside works by Renoir and Warhol—they sold for more than expected, while Renoir's and Warhol's did not sell. American collector Howard Hong purchased three of Congo's works for over US$25,000.\n\n"}

By the end of April 1833, he had become Victoria's companion, and by Christmas that year she was doting on him, giving him a set of rubber balls and two pieces of gingerbread as presents. In return, the dog was loyal to Victoria; on one occasion she went sailing on a yacht, and Dash leapt from the coastline into the sea and swam after her.\n\nVictoria, who was 13 when given Dash, had few if any childhood friends as she was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called \"Kensington System\", an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and Conroy. The only girl of a similar age with whom she had regular contact was Conroy's youngest daughter, Victoire, but they seemed to have had only a formal acquaintanceship.

The death trajectory is dependent on the cause of death, whether it is sudden death, chronic illness, or the steady decline in health due to senescence (aging). Death trajectory is analyzed in two separate aspects: duration and shape. Duration refers to the period of time a patient has to live, which can be anywhere from imminent death to several months. Shape refers to how that duration is then graphed. In other words, the shape is \"the course of dying, its predictability, and whether death is expected or unexpected\".\nDying trajectories were first studied in the 1960s by two researchers, Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss, in an attempt to understand the end of human life from different ailments, including cancer.\n\nSudden or premature death occurs when the death of an individual is not perceived to be imminent. In a sudden death trajectory, an otherwise healthy and high-functioning individual will suddenly and unexpectedly die without any observable indications of oncoming demise. People are at a high or normal level of functioning until the moment of death occurs. These types of deaths include fatal accidents and inconspicuous health issues like myocardial infarction or severe stroke. Deaths that align with a sudden death trajectory may happen over the course of a few days or in a matter of seconds.\n\nThe chronic malady trajectory occurs with types of death caused by autoimmune diseases such as HIV or other incurable illnesses. This process of death is characterized by an overall decline in health accompanied by acute crises and intermittent recoveries. The chronic malady trajectory projects emotional stress or turmoil; the patient may eventually become mentally and emotionally exhausted.\n\nA natural death trajectory is typically a long, steady decline due to old age. In these cases, the death trajectory is based on how the mind and body degenerate, including the speed of organ failure. In these cases, it is much easier to anticipate a person's death.\n\nWhen someone has an estimated death date and a death trajectory, the patient's caregivers generally cease curative care and proceed to provide palliative or comfort care. Curative care refers to situations where the patient still feels it is possible to use current medical care to recover or become stable enough to carry on with life. Comfort care, or hospice care, is reserved for patients who acknowledge they will not be able to recover.\n\n"}

{"id": "8156507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8156507", "title": "Fixation (histology)", "text": "Fixation (histology)\n\nIn the fields of histology, pathology, and cell biology, fixation is the preservation of biological tissues from decay due to autolysis or putrefaction. It terminates any ongoing biochemical reactions and may also increase the treated tissues' mechanical strength or stability. Tissue fixation is a critical step in the preparation of histological sections, its broad objective being to preserve cells and tissue components and to do this in such a way as to allow for the preparation of thin, stained sections. This allows the investigation of the tissues' structure, which is determined by the shapes and sizes of such macromolecules (in and around cells) as proteins and nucleic acids.\n\nIn performing their protective role, fixatives denature proteins by coagulation, by forming additive compounds, or by a combination of coagulation and additive processes. A compound that adds chemically to macromolecules stabilizes structure most effectively if it is able to combine with parts of two different macromolecules, an effect known as cross-linking.\nFixation of tissue is done for several reasons. One reason is to kill the tissue so that postmortem decay (autolysis and putrefaction) is prevented.\nFixation preserves biological material (tissue or cells) as close to its natural state as possible in the process of preparing tissue for examination. To achieve this, several conditions usually must be met.\n\nFirst, a fixative usually acts to disable intrinsic biomolecules—particularly proteolytic enzymes—which otherwise digest or damage the sample.\n\nSecond, a fixative typically protects a sample from extrinsic damage. Fixatives are toxic to most common microorganisms (bacteria in particular) that might exist in a tissue sample or which might otherwise colonize the fixed tissue. In addition, many fixatives chemically alter the fixed material to make it less palatable (either indigestible or toxic) to opportunistic microorganisms.\n\nFinally, fixatives often alter the cells or tissues on a molecular level to increase their mechanical strength or stability. This increased strength and rigidity can help preserve the morphology (shape and structure) of the sample as it is processed for further analysis.\n\nEven the most careful fixation does alter the sample and introduce artifacts that can interfere with interpretation of cellular ultrastructure. A prominent example is the bacterial \"mesosome\", which was thought to be an organelle in gram-positive bacteria in the 1970s, but was later shown by new techniques developed for electron microscopy to be simply an artifact of chemical fixation. Standardization of fixation and other tissue processing procedures takes this introduction of artifacts into account, by establishing what procedures introduce which kinds of artifacts. Researchers who know what types of artifacts to expect with each tissue type and processing technique can accurately interpret sections with artifacts, or choose techniques that minimize artifacts in areas of interest.\n\nFixation is usually the first stage in a multistep process to prepare a sample of biological material for microscopy or other analysis. Therefore, the choice of fixative and fixation protocol may depend on the additional processing steps and final analyses that are planned. For example, immunohistochemistry uses antibodies that bind to a specific protein target. Prolonged fixation can chemically mask these targets and prevent antibody binding. In these cases, a 'quick fix' method using cold formalin for around 24 hours is typically used. Methanol (100%) can also be used for quick fixation, and that time can vary depending on the biological material. For example, MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells can be fixed for only 3 minutes with cold methanol (-20 °C). For enzyme localization studies, the tissues should either be pre-fixed lightly only, or post-fixed after the enzyme activity product has formed.\n\nThere are generally three types of fixation processes depending on the initial specimen:\n\nHeat fixation: After a smear has dried at room temperature, the slide is gripped by tongs or a clothespin and passed through the flame of a Bunsen burner several times to heat-kill and adhere the organism to the slide. Routinely used with bacteria and archaea. Heat fixation generally preserves overall morphology but not internal structures.\nHeat denatures the proteolytic enzyme and prevents autolysis. Heat fixation cannot be used in the capsular stain method as heat fixation will shrink or destroy the capsule (glycocalyx) and cannot be seen in stains.\n\nImmersion: The sample of tissue is immersed in fixative solution of volume at a minimum of 20 times greater than the volume of the tissue to be fixed. The fixative must diffuse through the tissue to fix, so tissue size and density, as well as type of fixative must be considered. This is a common technique for cellular applications. Using a larger sample means it takes longer for the fixative to reach the deeper tissue.\n\nPerfusion: Fixation via blood flow. The fixative is injected into the heart with the injection volume matching cardiac output. The fixative spreads through the entire body, and the tissue doesn't die until it is fixed. This has the advantage of preserving perfect morphology, but the disadvantages are that the subject dies and the cost of the volume of fixative needed for larger organisms is high.\n\nIn both immersion and perfusion fixation processes, chemical fixatives are used to preserve structures in a state (both chemically and structurally) as close to living tissue as possible. This requires a chemical fixative.\n\nCrosslinking fixatives act by creating covalent chemical bonds between proteins in tissue. This anchors soluble proteins to the cytoskeleton, and lends additional rigidity to the tissue. Preservation of transient or fine cytoskeletal structure such as contractions during embryonic differentiation waves is best achieved by a pretreatment using microwaves before the addition of a cross linking fixative.\n\nThe most commonly used fixative in histology is formaldehyde. It is usually used as a 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF), that is approx. 3.7%–4.0% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Since formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, formalin – formaldehyde gas dissolved in water (~37% w/v) – is used when making the former fixative. Formaldehyde fixes tissue by cross-linking the proteins, primarily the residues of the basic amino acid lysine. Its effects are reversible by excess water and it avoids formalin pigmentation. Paraformaldehyde is also commonly used and will depolymerise back to formalin when heated, also making it an effective fixative. Other benefits to paraformaldehyde include long term storage and good tissue penetration. It is particularly good for immunohistochemistry techniques. The formaldehyde vapor can also be used as a fixative for cell smears.\n\nAnother popular aldehyde for fixation is glutaraldehyde. It operates in a similar way to formaldehyde by causing deformation of the alpha-helix structures in proteins. However glutaraldehyde is a larger molecule, and so the rate of diffusion across membranes is slower than formaldehyde. Consequently, glutaraldehyde fixation on thicker tissue samples may be hampered, but this can be overcome by reducing the size of the tissue sample. One of the advantages of glutaraldehyde fixation is that it may offer a more rigid or tightly linked fixed product—its greater length and two aldehyde groups allow it to 'bridge' and link more distant pairs of protein molecules. It causes rapid and irreversible changes, is well suited for electron microscopy, works well at 4 C, and gives the best overall cytoplasmic and nuclear detail. It is not ideal for immunohistochemistry staining.\n\nSome fixation protocols call for a combination of formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde so that their respective strengths complement one another.\n\nThese crosslinking fixatives, especially formaldehyde, tend to preserve the secondary structure of proteins and may protect significant amounts of tertiary structure as well.\n\nPrecipitating (or \"denaturing\") fixatives act by reducing the solubility of protein molecules and (often) by disrupting the hydrophobic interactions that give many proteins their tertiary structure. The precipitation and aggregation of proteins is a very different process from the crosslinking that occurs with the aldehyde fixatives.\n\nThe most common precipitating fixatives are ethanol and methanol. They are commonly used to fix frozen sections and smears. Acetone is also used and has been shown to produce better histological preservation than frozen sections when employed in the Acetone Methylbenzoate Xylene (AMEX) technique.\n\nThe protein denaturants – methanol, ethanol and acetone – are rarely used alone for fixing blocks unless studying nucleic acids.\n\nAcetic acid is a denaturant that is sometimes used in combination with the other precipitating fixatives, such as Davidson's AFA. The alcohols, by themselves, are known to cause considerable shrinkage and hardening of tissue during fixation while acetic acid alone is associated with tissue swelling; combining the two may result in better preservation of tissue morphology.\n\nThe oxidizing fixatives can react with various side chains of proteins and other biomolecules, allowing formation of crosslinks that stabilize tissue structure. However they cause extensive denaturation despite preserving fine cell structure and are used mainly as secondary fixatives.\n\nOsmium tetroxide is often used as a secondary fixative when samples are prepared for electron microscopy. (It is not used for light microscopy as it penetrates thick sections of tissue very poorly.)\n\nPotassium dichromate, chromic acid, and potassium permanganate all find use in certain specific histological preparations.\n\nMercurials such as B-5 and Zenker's fixative have an unknown mechanism that increases staining brightness and give excellent nuclear detail. Despite being fast, mercurials penetrate poorly and produce tissue shrinkage. Their best application is for fixation of hematopoietic and reticuloendothelial tissues. Also note that since they contain mercury care must be taken with disposal.\n\nPicrates penetrate tissue well to react with histones and basic proteins to form crystalline picrates with amino acids and precipitate all proteins. It is a good fixative for connective tissue, preserves glycogen well, and extracts lipids to give superior results to formaldehyde in immunostaining of biogenic and polypeptide hormones However, it causes a loss of basophils unless the specimen is thoroughly washed following fixation.\n\nHepes-glutamic acid buffer-mediated organic solvent protection effect (HOPE) gives formalin-like morphology, excellent preservation of protein antigens for immunohistochemistry and enzyme histochemistry, good RNA and DNA yields and absence of crosslinking proteins.\n\nSmall pieces of tissue (5×5×3mm) are placed in a cryoprotective embedding medium—OCT, TBS, or cryogel—then snap frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen. Tissue is then sectioned in a freezing microtome or cryostat and sections are fixed in one of the following fixatives:\n\n\n\n~ A picrate\n\nShould be kept in the physiological range, between pH 4-9. The pH for the ultrastructure preservation should be buffered between 7.2 to 7.4\n\nHypertonic solutions give rise to cell shrinkage.\n\nHypotonic solutions result in cell swelling and poor fixation.\n\n10% neutral buffer formalin is 4% formaldehyde (1.33 osmolar) in PBS buffer (0.3 osmolar) sums to 1.63 osmolar. This is a very hypertonic solution yet it has worked well as a general tissue fixation condition for many years in pathology labs. The size of tissue can also affect the fixation process.\n\n1–4 mm thickness [0.5 cm]\n\nAt least 15-20 times greater than tissue volume\n\nIncreasing the temperature increases speed of fixation. However, care is required to avoid cooking the specimen. Fixation is routinely carried out at room temperature.\n\nAs a general rule, 1 hour per millimetre of tissue paraformaldehyde (PFA) must penetrate. So if we have a three-dimensional tissue block, it is the shortest dimension that determines fixation time.\n\nFixation is a chemical process, and time must be allowed for the process to complete. Although \"over fixation\" can be detrimental, under-fixation has recently been appreciated as a significant problem and may be responsible for inappropriate results for some assays.\n\n"}

At thirteen he joined his great uncle Captain (later Admiral) Robert Duff in the Mediterranean, and was commissioned lieutenant at sixteen, breaking several fleet regulations but made possible by his uncle's interest in his career. During these years, Duff saw action thirteen times on both sides of the Atlantic, including at the Great Siege of Gibraltar and culminating in the battle of the Saintes in 1782 when he was serving on .\n\nWith a reputation thus secured and plenty of family interest in his career, Duff had little difficulty progressing, being promoted to commander in 1790 and then Post Captain in 1793, a meteoric rise resulting from the growth of the Navy in the buildup to war during this period. It was at this time that he married his childhood sweetheart, Sophia Dirom (sister of Alexander Dirom) in Edinburgh, and that his son Norwich Duff (later to become an admiral in his own right) was born. In the next ten years, Duff commanded , and all very capably, but without winning the acclaim of some of his contemporaries, particularly those in the Mediterranean under Nelson.\n\nDuff was a proud Scotsman as well as a strict disciplinarian. He enforced cleanliness parades every week, and made every effort to make sure that as many Scots as possible served on his ships, although he never gave them preferential treatment over their English comrades. He was also a devoted husband and wrote lengthy letters to his wife during every journey. He and his wife felt that the letters were so personal that they destroyed them after reading, and so the only survivor is his final letter home, which Sophia reportedly was unable to destroy.\n\nFollowing the Peace of Amiens, Duff was given , something of a celebrity ship in the Royal Navy following her capture of the French \"Hercule\" in 1799 in which her captain Alexander Hood was killed. Rapidly moulding the ship with his own brand of Scottish discipline, Duff took her to join the fleet off Cadiz at the beginning of October and instantly became friends with Nelson, despite their vastly different characters. Such was Duff's reputation, that Nelson entrusted him with the command of the inshore squadron, which watched the harbour entrance for an enemy appearance. The job was dangerous due to the proximity of the shore, and unpleasant because ships stationed at this point were exposed to the enemy and the threat of failure if the enemy were able to escape. Duff handled the job excellently however, and on 21 October reported that the enemy had left Cadiz and were heading out to sea.\n\nWhen the battle began, \"Mars\" was stationed directly astern of and was ordered by Nelson to attempt to overtake this, Collingwood's flagship, if he was able. Collingwood however had the advantage, with the Royal Sovereign's hull having been freshly re-coppered before action, so the \"Mars\" was the second ship to enter the enemy lines. During this approach, which due to poor wind had been conducted at walking speed, Duff was able to write a final note home to his wife, which he entrusted to his thirteen-year-old son Norwich, who was serving as a midshipman on \"Mars\":\n\n\"Dearest Sophia, I have just time to tell you we are going into Action with the Combined Fleet. I hope and trust in God that we shall all behave as becomes us, and that I may yet have the happiness of taking my beloved wife and children in my arms. Norwich is quite well and happy. I have, however, ordered him off the quarter-deck. Yours ever, and most truly, George\"\n\nDuff did not see more than the few opening shots of the battle, for as \"Mars\" engaged the French \"Fougueux\" and \"Pluton\", a cannonball from \"Fougueux\" raked the quarter-deck and struck Captain Duff at the base of the neck, severing his head completely. The crew were undismayed however, carrying the headless corpse around the deck and giving three cheers in memory of their captain, before replacing him where he fell and covering him with a Union Flag. Command of the \"Mars\" devolved on the first lieutenant, William Hennah, who performed a good service and was promoted as a reward.\n\nFollowing the battle, Duff was buried at sea with his shipmates, 28 of whom had been killed and 69 wounded in the fight. Both Collingwood and young Norwich Duff wrote letters of consolation to Sophia Duff, and Captain Duff was mentioned with honour alongside Nelson and John Cooke in the official report of the battle. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund granted Sophia honours and money. Norwich remained in the Navy, retiring many years later as an admiral. A large marble monument with the inscription \"Erected at the Public Expense to the memory of Captain George Duff who was killed the XXIst of Octr MDCCCV. commanding the Mars in the battle of Trafalgar in the forty-second year of his age and the twenty-ninth of his service.\" was raised in St Paul's Cathedral on the wall on the south side of a passage, next to Nelson's tomb, where it can still be seen. George, his mother-in-law Anne (née Fotheringham) and Norwich were all painted by Sir Henry Raeburn.\n\nThe Royal Navy has named two ships after Duff. The first, a Captain-class frigate constructed in the United States in 1942-1943 as HMS \"Duff\" (BDE-20), was retained by the United States Navy as the destroyer escort . The second was the Captain-class frigate , which served from 1943 to 1944.\n\n\n"}

Throughout much of his career he was associated with actor and playwright Jan Werich. In the US, he is best known for his role as the 11th juror in the 1957 film \"12 Angry Men\".\n\nVoskovec was born as Jiří Wachsmann in Sázava, Bohemia, present-day Czech Republic. He was the son of Jiřina (Pinkasová) and Václav Wachsmann. His granduncle was Bedřich Wachsmann and his cousin was Alois Wachsman, both painters and architects, while his uncle was Austrian painter Julius Wachsmann (1866–1936). He immigrated to the US in 1939 and again in 1948 with the onset of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes, respectively, in Czechoslovakia.\n\nHe attended school in Prague and Dijon, France. In 1927, together with Werich, he joined the Osvobozené divadlo (Liberated Theater), which had been created two years earlier by members of the avant-garde Devětsil group, Jiří Frejka and Jindřich Honzl. After disagreements led Frejka to leave the group in 1927, Honzl asked Voskovec and Werich, 22-year-old law students who had created a sensation with their Vest Pocket Revue that year, to join the theatre. When Honzl, who had directed their productions, left in 1929, Voskovec and Werich took control of the theatre and changed its name to the Liberated Theatre of Voskovec and Werich, assuming all responsibility for direction, writing, librettos, and other artistic decisions. The Liberated became a center for Czech clownery, a reaction to contemporary political and societal problems. Their performances began with the primary goal of evoking laughter through fantasy, but with the changing political situation in Germany their work became increasingly anti-fascist, which led to the closure of the Liberated Theater after the Munich agreement in 1938.\nBoth Voskovec and Werich fled to the United States in early 1939. For the rest of his life, Voskovec lived primarily in the United States, interrupted only by brief stays in Czechoslovakia in 1948 and in France from 1948 to 1950. Until the mid-1940s, Voskovec worked and wrote mostly with Jan Werich, but after Werich's return to Communist Czechoslovakia, they met only a few more times. After his return to the United States in 1950, Voskovec was unjustly detained at Ellis Island for eleven months for his alleged sympathy for Communism.\n\nAlthough Voskovec lived in three countries and his maternal grandmother was French, he always maintained that \"I am a born and bred Czech.\" In 1955, he became an American citizen. As a result of his naturalization, he is sometimes referred to as \"George Voskovec\".\n\nVoskovec acted in 72 movies. Only the first five of these were Czech; the rest were American or British. His most famous American movie role was as the 11th juror in \"12 Angry Men\" (1957), in which being a European immigrant to the U.S. was central to his role. His other famous films included \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\" (1965) and \"The Boston Strangler\" (1968), as renowned psychic Peter Hurkos. His last movie was \"Barbarosa\" (1982), with Willie Nelson and Gary Busey. In 1975, he published the Czech spoken LP record \"Relativně vzato\", where he reflects on his life and world in general. A sleeve note for this LP was written by another notable Czech émigré, author Josef Škvorecký. Voskovec also appeared in the 1978 television film \"The Nativity\" and the 1980 film \"Somewhere in Time\", starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. In 1981 Voskovec played Fritz Brenner in the NBC TV series \"Nero Wolfe\" with William Conrad as Nero Wolfe.\n\nVoskovec died in 1981 of a heart attack in Pearblossom, California, at the age of 76. He is survived by two daughters, Victoria and Georgeanne. His interment was at Olšany Cemetery in Prague.\n\nMinor planet 2418 Voskovec-Werich discovered by Luboš Kohoutek is named after him and Jan Werich.\n\n"}

The three germ layers in vertebrates are particularly pronounced; however, all eumetazoans (animals more complex than the sponge) produce two or three primary germ layers. Some animals, like cnidarians, produce two germ layers (the ectoderm and endoderm) making them diploblastic. Other animals such as chordates produce a third layer (the mesoderm), between these two layers. making them triploblastic. Germ layers eventually give rise to all of an animal’s tissues and organs through the process of organogenesis.\n\nCaspar Friedrich Wolff observed organization of the early embryo in leaf-like layers. In 1817, Heinz Christian Pander discovered three primordial germ layers while studying chick embryos. Between 1850 and 1855, Robert Remak had further refined the germ cell layer (\"Keimblatt\") concept, stating that the external, internal and middle layers form respectively the epidermis, the gut, and the intervening musculature and vasculature. The term \"mesoderm\" was introduced into English by Huxley in 1871, and \"ectoderm\" and \"endoderm\" by Lankester in 1873.\n\nAmong animals, sponges show the simplest organization, having a single germ layer. Although they have differentiated cells (e.g. collar cells), they lack true tissue coordination. Diploblastic animals, Cnidaria and Ctenophora, show an increase in complexity, having two germ layers, the endoderm and ectoderm. Diploblastic animals are organized into recognisable tissues. All higher animals (from flatworms to humans) are triploblastic, possessing a mesoderm in addition to the germ layers found in Diploblasts. Triploblastic animals develop recognizable organs.\n\nFertilization leads to the formation of a zygote. During the next stage, cleavage, mitotic cell divisions transform the zygote into a hollow ball of cells, a blastula. This early embryonic form undergoes gastrulation, forming a gastrula with either two or three layers (the germ layers). In all vertebrates, these progenitor cells differentiate into all adult tissues and organs.\n\nIn the human embryo, after about three days, the zygote forms a solid mass of cells by mitotic division, called a morula. This then changes to a blastocyst, consisting of an outer layer called a trophoblast, and an inner cell mass called the embryoblast. Filled with uterine fluid, the blastocyst breaks out of the zona pellucida and undergoes implantation. The inner cell mass initially has two layers: the hypoblast and epiblast. At the end of the second week, a primitive streak appears. The epiblast in this region moves towards the primitive streak, dives down into it, and forms a new layer, called the endoderm, pushing the hypoblast out of the way (this goes on to form the amnion.) The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The top layer is now called the ectoderm.\n\nThe endoderm is one of the germ layers formed during animal embryogenesis. Cells migrating inward along the archenteron form the inner layer of the gastrula, which develops into the endoderm.\n\nThe endoderm consists at first of flattened cells, which subsequently become columnar. It forms the epithelial lining of the whole of the digestive tract except part of the mouth and pharynx and the terminal part of the rectum (which are lined by involutions of the ectoderm). It also forms the lining cells of all the glands which open into the digestive tract, including those of the liver and pancreas; the epithelium of the auditory tube and tympanic cavity; the trachea, bronchi, and alveoli of the lungs; the bladder and part of the urethra; and the follicle lining of the thyroid gland and thymus.\n\nThe endoderm forms: the stomach, the colon, the liver, the pancreas, the bladder, the epithelial parts of trachea, the lungs, the pharynx, the thyroid, the parathyroid, and the intestines.\n\nThe mesoderm germ layer forms in the embryos of triploblastic animals. During gastrulation, some of the cells migrating inward contribute to the mesoderm, an additional layer between the endoderm and the ectoderm. The formation of a mesoderm leads to the development of a coelom. Organs formed inside a coelom can freely move, grow, and develop independently of the body wall while fluid cushions and protects them from shocks.\n\nThe mesoderm has several components which develop into tissues: intermediate mesoderm, paraxial mesoderm, lateral plate mesoderm, and chorda-mesoderm. The chorda-mesoderm develops into the notochord. The intermediate mesoderm develops into kidneys and gonads. The paraxial mesoderm develops into cartilage, skeletal muscle, and dermis. The lateral plate mesoderm develops into the circulatory system (including the heart and spleen), the wall of the gut, and wall of the human body.\n\nThrough cell signaling cascades and interactions with the ectodermal and endodermal cells, the mesodermal cells begin the process of differentiation.\n\nThe mesoderm forms: muscle (smooth and striated), bone, cartilage, connective tissue, adipose tissue, circulatory system, lymphatic system, dermis, genitourinary system, serous membranes, and notochord.\n\nThe ectoderm generates the outer layer of the embryo, and it forms from the embryo's epiblast. The ectoderm develops into the surface ectoderm, neural crest, and the neural tube.\n\nThe surface ectoderm develops into: epidermis, hair, nails, lens of the eye, sebaceous glands, cornea, tooth enamel, the epithelium of the mouth and nose.\n\nThe neural crest of the ectoderm develops into: peripheral nervous system, adrenal medulla, melanocytes, facial cartilage, dentin of teeth.\n\nThe neural tube of the ectoderm develops into: brain, spinal cord, posterior pituitary, motor neurons, retina.\n\nNote: The anterior pituitary develops from the ectodermal tissue of Rathke's pouch.\n\nBecause of its great importance, the neural crest is sometimes considered a fourth germ layer. It is, however, derived from the ectoderm.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39948325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39948325", "title": "Historical inheritance systems", "text": "Historical inheritance systems\n\nHistorical inheritance systems are different systems of inheritance among various people.\n\nDetailed anthropological and sociological studies have been made about customs of patrilineal inheritance, where only male children can inherit. Some cultures also employ matrilineal succession, where property can only pass along the female line, most commonly going to the sister's sons of the decedent; but also, in some societies, from the mother to her daughters. Some ancient societies and most modern states employ egalitarian inheritance, without discrimination based on gender and/or birth order.\n\nLand inheritance customs greatly vary across cultures. The Ethnographic Atlas gives the following data regarding land distribution: primogeniture predominates in 247 societies, while ultimogeniture prevails in 16. In 19 societies land is exclusively or predominantly given to the one adjudged best qualified, while equality predominates in 301 societies. Regarding land inheritance rules, in 340 societies sons inherit, in 90 other patrilineality|patrilineal heirs (such as brothers), in 31 sister's sons, in 60 other matrilineal heirs (such as daughters or brothers), and in 98 all children. In 43 societies land is given to all children, but daughters receive less. In 472 societies, the distribution of inherited land follows no clear rules or information is missing, while in 436 societies inheritance rules for real property do not exist or data is missing; this is partly because there are many societies where there is little or no land to inherit, such as in hunter-gatherer, pastoral societies or societies.\n\nPatrilineal primogeniture, where the eldest son inherits, was customary among\nmany cultures around the world. Patrilineal ultimogeniture, where the youngest son inherits, was customary among a number of cultures including: Fur, Fali, Sami (also called Lapp), Bashkir, Chuvash, Gagauz, Vep, Tatar, Achang, Ayi, Atayal, Kachi, Biate, Chinantec, Hmar, Mro, Kom, Purum and Lushei or Lushai (sometimes mistakenly taken for the whole Mizo people, especially in the past).\n\nAmong English peasants there was no clearly prevalent inheritance pattern, while Spanish Basques gave their land to the one considered best qualified, though they had a preference for sons. Giving more or less equal shares of land to sons, but excluded daughters was also common in many populations, as was giving relatively equal shares to both sons and daughters or slightly less to daughters. The same system prevails in contemporary Egypt and most Arab groups (see Sharia). Most non-Arab Muslims, with some exceptions (Caucasians, Iranians), historically followed their own inheritance customs, not those of the Sharia. In Ancient Egypt the eldest son inherited twice as much as other sons, and in earlier times he was the sole heir.\n\nAmong the Lao, the Aceh, the Guanches, and the Minangkabau, all daughters inherited equal shares of land. The Cham, the Jaintia, the Garo and the Khasi practiced female ultimogeniture. Primogeniture regardless of the sex of the child was customary among the Paiwan, the Ifugao, the Chugach and the French Basques, while ultimogeniture regardless of the sex of the child was customary among the Chuvash and the Mari.\n\nBilateral primogeniture is a rarer custom of inheritance where the eldest son inherits from the father and the eldest daughter inherits from the mother. This practice was common among the Classic Mayas, who transmitted the family's household furnishings from mother to eldest daughter, and the family's land, houses and agricultural tools from father to eldest son. It was also seen in the Greek island of Karpathos, where the family's house was transmitted from mother to eldest daughter, and the family's land was transmitted from father to eldest son. Among the Igorot, the father's land is inherited by his eldest son and the mother's land is inherited by her eldest daughter.\n\nA review of numerous studies found that the pattern of land inheritance traditionally prevalent among English, Dutch and New Englander peasants was partible inheritance. The pattern of land inheritance traditionally prevalent among Russian peasants was found to be close to patrilineal primogeniture, \"as oldest sons may well inherit more\". The conclusions of this review contradicts previous reports that Russians practiced equal inheritance of land by all sons and that the English, Dutch and New Englanders had no definite inheritance pattern.\n\nIn easternmost Europe, Patrilineal ultimogeniture prevailed among most Turkic peoples. Equal inheritance of property by all sons prevailed among most Uralic and Finno-Ugric peoples, and patrilineal primogeniture prevailed among Estonians and Balts.\n\nInheritance customs are sometimes considered a culturally distinctive aspect of a society. Although it is often thought that the Mizos employ ultimogeniture, this is because the customs of Lushais or Lusheis are confused with those of all Mizos; Mizo and Lushai have been occasionally used interchangeably. Among most non-Lushai Mizos, primogeniture predominates, just as among Kukis. In general there is great confusion about the ethnic identity of the many northeastern Indian tribes. Some regard the generic term Zomi as most appropriate.\n\nThe same disparity is seen regarding inheritance of movable property. Most nomadic peoples from Asia, for example the Khalka Mongols, give a more or less equal share of the herd to each son as he marries. Typically the youngest remain behind caring for the parents and inheriting his father's tent after their death in addition to his own share of the herd. However, others, such as the Yukaghir and the Yakuts, leave most of the herd to one son (in the above examples the youngest and the eldest, respectively). Some pastoral peoples from other geographical areas also practice unequal wealth transfers, although customs of equal male inheritance are more common among them than among agriculturalists.\n\nPatrilineal primogeniture with regards to both livestock and land was practiced by the Tswana people, whose main source of wealth was livestock, although they also practiced agriculture. This practice was also seen in other southern Bantu peoples, such as the Tsonga, or the Venda. Although, among the Venda, while the livestock was inherited by the eldest son, land was not inherited within families but given to each son by village authorities as he married. Current practice in Venda means the youngest son will inherit the house or property. Equally within the current Venda chief succession the youngest son is his father's successor. Among the Tsonga, most of the land was used only for stockbreeding. Patrilineal primogeniture also prevailed among the neighboring Khoi peoples, of whom only the Nama (among whom patrilineal primogeniture also prevailed)remain.\n\nMany other African peoples also practiced patrilineal primogeniture with regards to livestock. These included: The Ngoni, the Gogo, the Mangbetu, the Rendille, the Sapo, the Boran, the Gabra, the Plains Pokot, the Hema, the Beti-Pahuin, the Buduma, the Dogon, the Duala, the Djafun and the Kassena. According to the Ethnographic Atlas, the Fulbe or Fulani, the largest pastoral people in Africa, divided their livestock equally between all sons. However, according to some other sources they practiced male primogeniture.\n\nChukchi, Koryak and Ket peoples practiced male ultimogeniture. It has been stated that the rest of Siberian peoples, such as Voguls, Samoyeds or Khantys, practiced patrilineal primogeniture, though there isn't much reliable information about the traditional customs of Siberian peoples. It is said that Gilyaks divided their cattle equally between all sons. Patrilineal primogeniture was also traditionally prevalent among pastoral peoples from Australia, such as the Aranda, as well as among Himalayan pastoralists like the Changpa.\n\nPatrilineal primogeniture was traditionally prevalent among some pastoral peoples from Greenland and northern Canada. The neighboring indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were organized in societies where elder sons and their lines of descent had higher status than younger sons and their lines of descent (a \"conical clan\"), although a rule of patrilineal primogeniture couldn't develop among most of them since they were mostly hunter-gatherers. However, rule of patrilineal primogeniture did develop among some Canadian indigenous peoples who practiced agriculture, such as the Montagnais, the Kutchin, the Pikangikum, the Ojibwa, the Klallam and the Atsugewi. Canadian indigenous peoples were influenced by the ancient Thule culture, of which little is known with certainty.\n\nIntergenerational wealth transmission among agriculturalists tends to be rather unequal. Only slightly more than half of the societies studied practice equal division of real property; customs to preserve land relatively intact (most commonly primogeniture) are very common. Wealth transfers are more egalitarian among pastoralists, but unequal inheritance customs also prevail in some of these societies, and they are strongly patrilineal.\n\nA study of 39 non-Western societies found many customs that distinguished between children according to their sex and birth order. First sons, in comparison to other sons, \"are likely to inherit or otherwise gain control of more family land, livestock, or other wealth.\" First sons inherited more than the other sons among 11 societies studied. Among the Todas, both first and last sons inherited more than the other sons. Last sons inherited more than the other sons among the Lolo and the Yukaghir, and inherited less among the Luo. The people found to have the greatest number of customs favourable to first sons in the study were the Tswana, followed closely by the Azande. The people with the greatest number of customs favorable to last sons in their study were the Lolo. This study confirmed ethnographers' claims that customs favorable to first sons were common in South Asia, Austronesia and Sub-Saharan Africa, while customs favorable to last sons were common among the ethnic minorities of Southwest China.\n\nThe only custom that distinguished between sons among the Dagor Mongols was that first sons received more respect from his siblings and last sons received less respect from their siblings. This contradicts those theories that maintain that peoples of the Asian steppe had strong customs favorable to first or last sons. In fact, the indigenous American peoples had significantly more customs favorable to first sons than the Dagor Mongols.\n\nAmong Arab peoples, such as the Egyptian Fellahin, all sons inherited the same and had the same wealth. This was also seen among the Alaska Native peoples such as the Eyak.\n\nJack Goody was an influential anthropologist during the twentieth century. However, his theories have been mostly rejected during the last decades. He made a distinction between a complete and a preferential form of primogeniture and ultimogeniture. In the complete form of both customs, the rest of the children are excluded from the inheritance. However, in the preferential form of primogeniture, the eldest son acts as custodian of the father's rights on behalf of his brothers. In the preferential form of ultimogeniture, the youngest son inherits the residue of his father's property after elder sons have received their shares during the father's lifetime. Goody called ultimogeniture \"Borough English\" and primogeniture \"Borough French\" because in England ultimogeniture was a native custom, while primogeniture was a custom brought by the Norman invaders. According to Goody, in Late Medieval England, patrilineal primogeniture predominated in feudal tenures and among the peasantry of large parts of the Midlands. Patrilineal ultimogeniture (\"Borough English\") prevailed elsewhere in the champion country. Partible inheritance (\"gavelkind\") prevailed in Kent, East Anglia and the Celtic areas.\n\nBoth preferential primogeniture and preferential ultimogeniture were practiced in pre-revolutionary Russia, where the eldest son succeeded as family head and inherited more than the other sons. \"The youngest son, if he remained with the father, inherited the house and also at times other property\" (\"minorat\"). However, the share of land and moveables of the other sons was only slightly smaller than that of the eldest and the youngest son. Only in the southern part of the country was the house inherited by the youngest son; in the north it was inherited by the eldest son.\n\nThe Russian family of around 1900 considered property such as the house, agricultural implements, livestock and produce as belonging collectively to all family members. When the father died, his role as head of the family (known as Khozain, or Bolshak ) was passed to the oldest person in the house. In some areas this was the oldest son. In others it was the oldest brother of the deceased so long as he lived in the same house. There were some areas were a new head would be elected by the family members. If all surviving members of the family were under age, a relation would become a co-proprietor. If property was divided after a death, each adult male in the house got an equal share. Sons who had left home did not have a right of succession. Females remained within the family and received a share of the inheritance when they married. In the north of Russia, the oldest son inherited the house. In the south the eldest son would have set up a separate house while the father was still alive, therefore the youngest inherited the fathers house upon his death.\n\nThroughout history, creative inheritance systems have been created, fitting the best needs of the various people according to their unique environment and challenges.\n\nInheritance customs do not follow clear ethnic, linguistic or geographical patterns. Equality between all sons and a subordinate position of women, with the exclusion of daughters from inheriting, are prominent aspects of Hungarian, Albanian, Romanian, Armenian, and most Slavic or Latin American cultures. While many studies show the privileged position that the eldest son traditionally enjoyed in Slovene, Finnish or Tibetan culture. The Jaintia, the Garo and the Khasi, on the other hand, traditionally privileged the youngest daughter. Some peoples, like the Dinka, the Arakanese, the Chins of Myanmar, or the Karen, frequently show a compromise between primogeniture and ultimogeniture in their inheritance patterns. Although among many Chins of Myanmar, the advantage that the eldest and the youngest son have over other sons is really small, so it is not correct to speak of a true pattern of mixed primogeniture and ultimogeniture. The advantage of the eldest and the youngest son is somewhat more ample among the Dinka and the Arakanese. The compromise between primogeniture and ultimogeniture was also found among the Kachin and the Dilling, as well as among the Sherpa to some degree. This pattern of inheritance is also reported for many Fulbe villages in the Republic of Guinea, though it seems that in past times the eldest son inherited all in Guinea.\n\nSometimes inheritance customs do not entirely reflect social traditions. Romans valued sons more than daughters, and Thais and Shan showed the reverse pattern, though all practiced equal land inheritance between all children. The Shan people, who live mostly in northern Thailand and northeastern Myanmar, are markedly matrilocal.\n\nIn Han Chinese tradition, the eldest son was of special importance. The law punished more harshly offences by a younger brother against an elder brother than vice versa. The eldest son received the family headship in cases where the family held together as a single unit, and the largest share in cases of family division, since he also inherited the cult to family ancestors. This is still practiced in Taiwan nowadays, though Chinese peasants have practiced partible inheritance since the time of the Qin and Han Dynasties, when the previous system of male primogeniture was abolished. In some cases, the eldest son of the eldest son, rather than the eldest son, was favored. Ritual primogeniture was emphasized in the lineage organizations of North China. During the Longshan culture period and the period of the three Dynasties (Xia, Zhou and Shang), patrilineal primogeniture predominated.\n\nAmong Mongols it has been usually stated that the youngest son had a special position because he cared for his parents in their old age. On their death he inherited the parental tent, which was connected with the religious cult in Mongol traditions, though all sons received more or less equal shares of livestock as they married. However, in contrast to this popularly held notion, more rigorous and substantiated anthropological studies of kinship and family in central Asian peoples strongly indicate that in these societies elder sons and their lines of descent had higher status than younger sons and their lines of descent. In central Asia, all members of a lineage were terminologically distinguished by generation and age, with senior superior to junior. The lineage structure of central Asia had three different modes: genealogical distance, or the proximity of individuals to one another on a graph of kinship; generational distance, or the rank of generation in relation to a common ancestor; and birth order, the rank of brothers in relation to each another. The paternal descent lines were collaterally ranked according to the birth of their founders, and were thus considered senior and junior to each other. Of the various collateral patrilines, the senior in order of descent from the founding ancestor, the line of eldest sons, was the most noble. In the steppe, no one had his exact equal; everyone found his place in a system of collaterally ranked lines of descent from a common ancestor. It was according to this idiom of superiority and inferiority of lineages derived from birth order that legal claims to superior rank were couched. Furthermore, at least among Mongols, the elder son inherited more than the younger son, and this is mandated by law codes such as the Yassa, created by Genghis Khan.\n\nAmong Arabic peoples, it is sometimes argued that the expansion of Islam brought an end to the sharp distinction between the firstborn and other sons so characteristic of ancient Semitic peoples. However, many peoples who have partially or completely embraced Islam, have also established inequality between sons, such as the Oromo of east Africa, who had patrilineal primogeniture in inheritance, in spite of the fact that some of them were Muslim. Other Muslim peoples, like the Minangkabau and the Javanese of Indonesia, the Turks, or the Fur in Sudan, also have inheritance practices that contradict their Islamic beliefs. Most non-Arab Muslims historically followed their own inheritance customs, not those of the Sharia.\n\nIn India, inheritance customs were (and still are) very diverse. Patrilineal primogeniture predominated in ancient times. The Laws of Manu state that the oldest son inherits all of the father's estate. Since the Middle Ages patrilineal equal inheritance has prevailed in perhaps a majority of groups, although the eldest son often received an extra share. Under this system, the estate would be shared between all sons, but these would often remain together with their respective families under the headship of the karta or family head, who was usually the eldest son of the previous family head. However, among some South Asian peoples, such as the Western Punjabi, male primogeniture continued to prevail.\n\nThe practice of widow inheritance by younger brothers has been observed in many parts of Africa and the Asian steppe, as well as small zones of South Asia. This practice forces younger brothers to marry older women. Eastern European cultures, on the other hand, are characterized by early, universal and equal access to marriage and reproduction, due to their systems of equal inheritance of land and movable property by all sons. Research on pre-industrial Russian Karelia however, suggests that younger brothers frequently remained unmarried, and the joint-family household characterized by the equal inheritance of land and moveable property by all sons and patriarchal power relations wasn't universal in Russia.\n\nThe patrilineal joint-family systems and more or less equal inheritance for all son in India and China meant that there was no difference in marriage and reproduction due to birth order. In the stem-family systems of Northwest Europe however, access to marriage and reproduction wasn't equal for all sons, since only one of them would inherit most or all of the land.\n\nThe survival and well-being of children in India and China is positively influenced by the number of older siblings of the opposite sex and negatively influenced by the number of older siblings of the same sex. However, definitive celibacy was historically relatively uncommon in India and China, but relatively common in many European societies where inheritance was impartible. The Han Chinese first sons historically married earlier, had lower rates of definitive celibacy and more children (especially males) than their younger brothers. However, they suffered higher mortality rates. This has been attributed to the fact that eldest sons needed to have more children to succeed them as heads and were willing to take more risks and suffer a higher drain of resources to achieve this. The Chinese joint family system had strong inegalitarian traits that made it demographically more akin to a stem family system. According to Emmanuel Todd and others, it be reminiscent of the system of patrilineal primogeniture prevalent during the Longshan culture period and the period of the Three Dynasties.\n\nThere is a strong relationship between fertility and inheritance in \"Malthusian\" contexts of resource scarcity. In contexts where resources are plentiful, the relationship between inheritance and social outcomes can be different. In the Midwest and Northeast United States during the period from 1775 to 1875, where resources were plentiful, being the first son was positively correlated with wealth and fertility. As in other western cultures, but unlike European societies where resources were scarce, this has a complex relationship with inheritance.\n\nInheritance practices and seniority of patriline, as well as the importance of inheritance itself, have varied over time among the Lisu. This was mostly in response to changes in resource availability and poppy cultivation.\n\nIn the United States, daughters currently inherit on average more than sons. In the past, however, the eldest son was favored in matters of land inheritance. During the Colonial Period, the eldest son inherited twice more than the other sons in the northern colonies (these inheritance laws were modelled on Mosaic Law), and in the southern colonies there was a rule of male primogeniture.\n\nIn northern Ghana, a region where male primogeniture predominates, rich households favoured sons over daughters. It is likely that first born sons would have been preferred as they would inherit the wealth and therefore have higher reproductive prospects.\n\nIn recent times inheritance in the western world has generally been egalitarian despite parents showing favoritism towards daughters and later-born sons. In parent-son relationships, mothers usually show favouritism towards the first son and fathers to later born sons however these tendencies have lost much of their importance with regards to inheritance.\n\nCustoms of ultimogeniture among farmers has been explained as a consequence of postponing retirement so they do not feel \"dethroned\" early by their eldest son. This line of thinking has been linked to the preeminence of lastborn siblings in popular myth and folklore around the world. As a consequence, in some cultures that practice male preimogentiure there are ambiguous, contradictory feelings towards last born sons.\n\nAmong the Hausa of West Africa, who practice primogeniture, the mother and oldest son engage in mutual avoidance behavior to mark the woman's positive change in status upon producing an heir. The father may also avoid the son if he is the mother's first male child, speaking to him through intermediaries rather than directly.\n\nAmong the Mossi of central Burkina Faso in West Africa, the eldest son would be sent to relatives shortly after circumcision and return to the parental household shortly after puberty; after the death of his father he would inherit his property.\n\nA study of the people of the Pacific island Tikopia in 1929 found that the eldest son must marry and receive more land, while the younger sons remain bachelors, emigrate or even die. However, by 1952 many of the customs were being abandoned and marriage was beginning to become universal. In the succession to chieftainship, the traditional custom of male primogeniture continued though.\n\nIn some societies in Sub-Saharan Africa where male primogeniture was practiced, tensions between parents and their inheriting eldest son were resolved through rituals of avoidance. This was most extreme among the Tallensi. Among East Asian peoples, on the other hand, co-residence between parents and their eldest son was thought of as normal and desirable in systems of impartible inheritance, and in some countries such as Japan, Vietnam and South Korea it is widely practiced even nowadays. Historically in Japan, marriage and reproduction by the eldest son was facilitated by their status as heirs.\n\nIn Japan, Korea and Vietnam, as well as in some of those European regions where male primogeniture was practiced, parents didn't transfer their property to the inheriting son at the point of his marriage as among Germans. Instead, the first son remained under his father's authority even after he had married and had had children, and the father remained the nominal head of the family until his death, relinquishing his actual authority slowly and gradually. In Japan, only the inheriting son stayed in the parental household. He could become head of the family any time between his marriage and the death of his predecessor. The timing of this was normally dictated by familial or local traditions. The Catalan and Occitan stem families in Europe closely resembled the model seen in Japan.\n\nIn rural China, property and landholdings are usually divided up when the older son marries.\nNormally the youngest son continues to live with the parents and inherits their remaining share of the property. Prior to the revolution in 1949, most families in rural areas of China stayed together for many years after the oldest son marries, sometimes until the youngest son married. However, there is some evidence that the practice of co-residing with the eldest son continues.\n\nIn Israel, coresidence between parents and their eldest son prevails in the context of the Moshav movement, that prohibited breaking up family plots; thus the eldest son inherits the family farm.\n\nIn South Korea, modern businesses (chaebol) are handed down according to male primogeniture in most cases. A study of family firms in the UK, France, Germany and US found that male primogeniture was the inheritance rule in more than half of family firms in France and the UK, but only in less than a third of those in the US and only in a quarter (25 per cent) of those in Germany.\n\nEmploying differing forms of succession can affect many areas of society. Gender roles are profoundly affected by inheritance laws and traditions. Impartible inheritance has the effect of keeping large estates united and thus perpetuating an elite. With partible inheritance large estates are slowly divided among many descendants and great wealth is thus diluted. Inheritance customs can even affect gender differences in cognitive abilities. Among the Karbis, who employ male primogeniture, men perform significantly better than women in tasks of spatial abilities. There are no significant differences in the performance of men and women among the Khasis, who employ female ultimogeniture.\n\nThe degree of acceptance that a society may show towards an inheritance rule can also vary. In South Africa, for example, the influence of more modern, western social ideas has caused strong opposition, both civil and official, to the customary law of patrilineal primogeniture traditionally prevalent among black peoples, and inheritance customs are gradually changing.\n\nAmong the indigenous tribes of South Africa, the oldest son inherits after the death of the father. If the oldest son is also dead, the oldest surviving grandson inherits; if the eldest son has no sons, the inheritance is passed to the father's second son or his sons, and so on through all the sons and their male children if necessary. In polygynous families which were formed of multiple units, the inheritance rules were changed slightly. Each marriage formed a new unit, independent from the others, with separate property which was inherited by the heir of each unit. Polygynous families practised either simple or complex inheritance. In the simple system the heir is the eldest son of the first wife, of if he is dead, the eldest grandson. If the first wife had no sons, the inheritance went to the oldest surviving male descendant of the second wife, and so on through all the wives if necessary. Complex inheritance happened when the homestead was separated into two or three units, depending on the number of wives, and the eldest son of each wife became heir of their unit. If there was no heir in one of the units, the heir of the other inherited both. This form of inheritance was seen among the Xhosa people of south eastern South Africa.\n\nIn Lesotho and southern Ethiopia, most people still follow the custom of male primogeniture.\nHowever, in Zambia, Namibia and Cameroon, the prevalent customary law of patrilineal primogeniture is beginning to be challenged in court. In eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the predominant custom of male primogeniture is also beginning to be considered unfair by some women and younger sons. The custom of patrilineal primogeniture predominant in South Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Zimbabwe and Gambia have not caused much opposition.\n\nIn Ghana, the diverse inheritance customs across ethnic groups, such as the male primogeniture among the Ewe and the Krobos, or matrilineal inheritance among the Akan, contribute to the occurrence of children living in the streets. In Sierra Leone, the inheritance customs prevalent in the country, were either the eldest son or the eldest brother inherits the property, create insecurities for widows. In South Korea, favouring the eldest son has been predominant almost up to recent times, despite laws of equal inheritance for all children. In 2005, in more than half (52.6 per cent) cases of inheritance the eldest son inherited most or all of his parent's property; in more than 30 per cent of cases the eldest son inherited all of his parent's property. In the past North Korea has the same pattern of inheritance as the South, however no details about current inheritance practices have been available since the county's proclamation of independence in 1948.\n\nSocial transformations can also modify inheritance customs to a great extent. For example, the Samburu of north-central Kenya are pastoralists who have traditionally practiced an attenuated form of patrilineal primogeniture, with the eldest son receiving the largest share of the family herd and each succeeding son receiving a considerably smaller share than any of his seniors. Now that many of them have become agriculturalists, some argue that land inheritance should follow patrilineal primogeniture, while others argue for equal division of the land. The Bhil people of central India, who were hunter-gatherers in the past, adopted a system of attenuated patrilineal primogeniture identical to that of pastoral Samburu when they became agriculturalists. The same custom also prevails among some other peoples, like the Elgeyo and Maasai in Kenya, or the Nupe of Nigeria and Niger. Most of the Amhara in Ethiopia divide their property between all sons, however male primogeniture is practised in some regions. Favoring the eldest son is also common among the Dinka in South Sudan. Among the Shona of Zimbabwe and Mozambique, the oldest son it the first to inherit and gets the best piece of the land. The oldest accounts of the Shona mention patrilineal primogeniture as their inheritance custom, with the oldest son of any of the deceased's wives becoming the main heir. The widow was inherited by her husbands brother but could choose not to be.\n\nDetailed anthropological and sociological studies have been made about customs of patrilineal inheritance, where only male children can inherit. Some cultures also employ matrilineal succession, where property can only pass along the female line, most commonly going to the sister's sons of the decedent; but also, in some societies, from the mother to her daughters. Some ancient societies and most modern states employ egalitarian inheritance, without discrimination based on gender and/or birth order.\n\nThe right of patrilineal primogeniture, though widespread during medieval and modern times in Europe, doesn't seem to have prevailed so extensively in ancient times. In Athens, according to Demosthenes and the Laws of Solon, the eldest son inherited the house and with it the cult to family ancestors. Aristotle spoke about patrilineal primogeniture during his time in Thebes and Corinth. He also spoke about the revolts that put an end to it in Massalia, Istros, Heraclea and Cnido). While Aristotle was opposed to this right, Plato wanted it to become more widespread. However, the nature of inheritance practices in Ancient Sparta is hotly debated among scholars. Ancient Greeks also considered the eldest son the avenger of wrongs done to parents—\"The Erinyes are always at the command of the first-born\".\n\nRoman law didn't recognise primogeniture, but in practice Romans favored the eldest son. In Ancient Persia, succession to the family headship was determined by patrilineal primogeniture.\n\nAmong Celtic and Germanic peoples, the predominant custom during ancient times seems to have been to divide the land in equal parts for each of the sons. However, the house could be left to only one of them. Evidence of actual practices and law codes such as the Sachsenspiegel indicate that Germans left the house to the youngest son. This was possibly connected to the cult to family ancestors, which was also inherited by the youngest son. Celts from Ireland and northern France left the house to the eldest son. Both Germans and Irish divided the land into equal shares until the early Modern Age, when impartible inheritance gradually took hold among both peoples. However, according to Tacitus the German tribe of the Tencteri employed patrilineal primogeniture. There is also evidence that in Schleswig Holstein, leaving the estate to the eldest son and giving only monetary compensation to his siblings was the prevailing practice since around the year 100. Patrilineal primogeniture also prevailed among the Vikings. In Scotland, certain types of property descended exclusively to the eldest son in the Scottish Lowlands even before the Norman conquest in 1066. Patrilineal primogeniture with regards to all types of immoveable property became the legal rule in all of Scotland during the reign of William I (1165–1214). Until 1868, all immovable property, also called in Scottish law \"heritable property\" (buildings, lands, etc.) was inherited exclusively by the eldest son and couldn't be included in a will. After 1868, it could be included in a will or testament, but if a person died intestate, it was still inherited exclusively by the eldest son. In 1964, this rule of male primogeniture in cases of intestacy was finally abolished. According to Bede, the custom in Northumbria reserved a substantial birthright for the eldest son even before the Norman conquest and other local customs of inheritance also gave certain additional benefits to the eldest son. After the Norman conquest, male primogeniture became widespread throughout England, becoming the common law with the promulgation of the Magna Carta in 1215, only slightly later than in Scotland. After 1540, a testator could dispose of its immovable property as he saw fit with the use of a testament, but until 1925 it was still inherited solely by the eldest son if he died intestate. However, although the gentry and the nobility in England practiced a relatively strict form of male primogeniture, there was no clearly prevalent inheritance pattern among peasants, giving rise to a sort of \"proto-capitalist\" rural economy, the \"absolute nuclear\" family. During Late Medieval Times male ultimogeniture (\"Borough-English\") was the predominant custom in England, as it was the customary rule of inheritance among unfree peasants, and this social class comprised most of the population according to the Domesday Book. In Scotland, by contrast, a strict form of male primogeniture prevailed (and still prevails) even among peasants.\n\nThe Scottish clan of the feudal era, which survived in the Highlands until 1747, was the only known example of a conical clan in Europe, along with the Roman gens according to Fustel de Coulanges. As Gartmore says in a paper written in 1747, \"The property of these Highlands belongs to a great many different persons, who are more or less considerable in proportion to the extent of their estates, and to the command of men that live upon them, or follow them on account of their clanship, out of the estates of others. These lands are set by the landlord during pleasure, or a short tack, to people whom they call good-men, and who are of a superior station to the commonality. These are generally the sons, brothers, cousins, or nearest relations of the landlord. The younger sons of families are not bred to any business or employments, but are sent to the French or Spanish armies, or marry as soon as they are of age. Those are left to their own good fortune and conduct abroad, and these are preferred to some advantageous farm at home. This, by the means of a small portion, and the liberality of their relations, they are able to stock, and which they, their children, and grandchildren, possess at an easy rent, till a nearer descendant be again preferred to it.\nAs the propinquity removes, they become less considered, till at last they degenerate to be of the common people; unless some accidental acquisition of wealth supports them above their station. As this hath been an ancient custom, most of the farmers and cottars are of the name and clan of the proprietor; and, if they are not really so, the proprietor either obliges them to assume it, or they are glaid to do so, to procure his protection and favour.\"\n\nPrior to the advent of feudalism during Late Medieval times and the creation of the system above explained, no trace of male primogeniture or a similar custom existed in Scotland or elsewhere in the Celtic world. The successor to the office of the chief was selected among the wider kin of the previous chief (tanistry), and the land, among common families, was divided between all sons. Among many ancient Germanic tribes, on the other hand, male primogeniture determined succession to political office, the eldest son of a chief customarily succeeding his father. The common rule of land inheritance was partible inheritance, as in the Celtic world.\n\nThe British custom of male primogeniture became also prevalent in some British colonies, most strongly in Australia. The contrary development occurred in South Africa, where the Afrikaner colonizers, who practiced partible inheritance, were always opposed to the custom of male primogeniture prevalent among indigenous black peoples. In New Zealand, European colonizers chose any son to succeed to the family farm, without regards to his fraternal birth order, while patrilineal primogeniture prevailed among the indigenous Maori people.\n\nIn parts of northern France, giving a slightly larger share to the eldest son was common among peasants even before the 10th century; after that century, patrilineal primogeniture developed among the nobility (impartible inheritance never obtained among peasants in most of northern France). Flanders was probably the first country where patrilineal primogeniture became predominant among aristocrats. By the time of the French revolution it had become almost universal in this social class in western, central and northern Europe, but inheritance customs among peasants varied widely across regions.\n\nStrabo also speaks about customs of male primogeniture among Iberian peoples (most of the Iberian peninsula was populated by then by Celtic or half-Celtic peoples, not Iberians proper). He mentions that among the Cantabrii, however, the eldest child regardless of sex inherited the family property. By the term \"Cantabrii\" he was most probably referring not to the actual Cantabrians but to the Basques (who were not an Iberian people); among the Basques of France, this usage survived until the French Revolution, long after it had been replaced by male primogeniture or free selection of an heir among the Basques of Spain. In Catalonia, in northeastern Spain, the custom of male primogeniture survived in an exceptionally vigorous form among peasants until very recent times (in northeastern Catalonia, for example, peasants rigorously respected the right of male primogeniture until very recent times. In the province of Lleida, too, even as late as the mid-twentieth century, only 7.11 percent of the sons who became single-heirs were not the first son. In central and southern Catalonia, male primogeniture was also predominant). However, in other past Iberian regions which were subject to greater Muslim influence, such as Valencia, this custom only survived in some areas.\n\nThe ancient Welsh laws of inheritance inform us about the evolution of inheritance practices in Great Britain. The Venedotian Code establishes that land must be partitioned between all sons and that the youngest has a preferential claim to the buildings:\n\n\"If there be buildings, the youngest brother but one is to divide the tyddyns,* for in that case he is the meter; and the youngest to have his choice of the tyddyns, and after that he is to divide all the patrimony. And by seniority they are to choose unto the youngest; and that division is to continue during the lives of the brothers.\"\n\n\"If there be no buildings on the land, the youngest son is to divide all the patrimony, and the eldest is to choose; and each, in seniority, choose unto the youngest.\"\n\n\"Land of a hamlet is not to be shared as tyddyns, but as gardens; and if there be buildings thereon, the youngest son is not more entitled to them than the eldest, but they are to be shared as chambers.\"\n\n\"When brothers share their patrimony between them, the younger is to have the principal tenement, and all the buildings, of his father, and eight einvs of land; his boiler, his hatchet, and his coulter, because a father cannot give these three to any one but the youngest son, and though they should be pledged they never become forfeited. Then let every brother take an homestead with eight erws of land; and the youngest son is to divide, and they are to choose in succession from the eldest to the youngest.\"\n\nThis was later replaced by a preference for the eldest son, and the Dimetian Code provides:\n"}
{"id": "31405724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31405724", "title": "IPO underpricing algorithm", "text": "IPO underpricing algorithm\n\nIPO underpricing is the increase in stock value from the initial offering price to the first-day closing price. Many believe that underpriced IPOs leave money on the table for corporations, but some believe that underpricing is inevitable. Investors state that underpricing signals high interest to the market which increases the demand. On the other hand, overpriced stocks will drop long-term as the price stabilizes so underpricing may keep the issuers safe from investor litigation.\n\nUnderwriters and investors and corporations going for an initial public offering (IPO), issuers, are interested in their market value. There is always tension that results since the underwriters want to keep the price low while the companies want a high IPO price.\n\nUnderpricing may also be caused by investor over-reaction causing spikes on the initial days of trading. The IPO pricing process is similar to pricing new and unique products where there is sparse data on market demand, product acceptance, or competitive response. Besides, underpricing is also affected by the firm idiosyncratic factors such as its business model. Thus it is difficult to determine a clear price which is compounded by the different goals issuers and investors have.\n\nThe problem with developing algorithms to determine underpricing is dealing with noisy, complex, and unordered data sets. Additionally, people, environment, and various environmental conditions introduce irregularities in the data. To resolve these issues, researchers have found various techniques from artificial intelligence that normalizes the data.\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) resolves these issues by scanning the data to develop internal representations of the relationship between the data. By determining the relationship over time, ANNs are more responsive and adaptive to structural changes in the data. There are two models for ANNs: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\n\nIn supervised learning models, there are tests that are needed to pass to reduce mistakes. Usually, when mistakes are encountered i.e. test output does not match test input, the algorithms use back propagation to fix mistakes. Whereas in unsupervised learning models, the input is classified based on which problems need to be resolved.\n\nEvolutionary programming is often paired with other algorithms e.g. ANN to improve the robustness, reliability, and adaptability. Evolutionary models reduce error rates by allowing the numerical values to change within the fixed structure of the program. Designers provide their algorithms the variables, they then provide training data to help the program generate rules defined in the input space that make a prediction in the output variable space.\n\nIn this approach, the solution is made an individual and the population is made of alternatives. However, the outliers cause the individuals to act unexpectedly as they try to create rules to explain the whole set.\n\nFor example, Quintana first abstracts a model with 7 major variables. The rules evolved from the Evolutionary Computation system developed at Michigan and Pittsburgh: \n\nQuintana uses these factors as signals that investors focus on. The algorithm his team explains shows how a prediction with a high-degree of confidence is possible with just a subset of the data.\n\nLuque approaches the problem with outliers by performing linear regressions over the set of data points (input, output). The algorithm deals with the data by allocating regions for noisy data. The scheme has the advantage of isolating noisy patterns which reduces the effect outliers have on the rule-generation system. The algorithm can come back later to understand if the isolated data sets influence the general data. Finally, the worst results from the algorithm outperformed all other algorithms' predictive abilities.\n\nCurrently, many of the algorithms assume homogeneous and rational behavior among investors. However, there's an approach alternative to financial modeling, and it's called agent-based modelling (ABM). ABM uses different autonomous agents whose behavior evolves endogenously which lead to complicated system dynamics that are sometimes impossible to predict from the properties of individual agents. ABM is starting to be applied to computational finance. Though, for ABM to be more accurate, better models for rule-generation need to be developed.\n"}

{"id": "2068282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068282", "title": "King Wuling of Zhao", "text": "King Wuling of Zhao\n\nKing Wuling of Zhao (Traditional Chinese: 趙武靈王, Simplified Chinese: 赵武灵王) (died 295 BCE, reigned 325 BCE – 299 BCE) reigned in the State of Zhao during the Warring States period of Chinese history. His reign was famous for one important event: the reforms consisting of \"Wearing the Hu (styled) Attire and Shooting from Horseback (in battle)\" (Simplified Chinese: 胡服骑射, Traditional Chinese: 胡服騎射) He was credited for the implementation of protective outfit during military events and proceedings.\n\nProbably the son of Zhao Suhou (Marquess Su of Zhao, Simplified Chinese: 赵肃侯), King Wuling of Zhao ascended to the throne at 325 BCE, about halfway into the Warring States Period. His reign coincided with the appearance of several other notable figures in the Warring States. He was also the first ruler of Zhao to style himself \"king\" (王), but later reversed the decision. He would later receive the title as part of his posthumous name.\n\nDuring the early years of his reign, the Kingdom of Zhao was constantly harassed by the Donghu, the Linhu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 林胡), the Loufan (Simplified Chinese: 楼烦) and the Beidi, all nomadic animal husbandry tribes. This might have been the inspiration for his later reforms. On another level, Wuling himself had been humbled after a great defeat by Qin. Previously, during 325-323 BC, he, along with the rulers of Han, Wei, Yan and Zhongshan, had declared himself king. However, in 318 BC, Zhao suffered a great defeat in the hands of Qin, causing Wuling to muse that since he did not have the power of a king, he should not use the title. \n\nIn 307 BCE, Wuling started his reforms. Mostly military, they concentrated on making the military more suited to fighting battles. Up to that time, Zhao commanders riding on horseback still wore robes and normal court attire. Wuling ordered all commanders, including the whole court and military, to adopt the Hu style of dress: pants, belt, boots, fur caps and fur clothes. He created a cavalry division in the army and trained them not only in the ways of a cavalry charge, but also in horse archery.\n\nWhile many reformists and officials supported the reforms, seeing it as a way to greatness and power, conservative members of the royal family such as Zhao Wuling's uncle Lord Cheng (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 公子成) disliked it, claiming that there should not be any \"Copying of barbaric clothing and changing of old rules\" (Simplified Chinese: 不该 \"袭远方之服, 变古之教\"). Lord Cheng even went so far as to be absent from court.\n\nWuling did much to check the opposition. He said, \"There is not only one way to rule the world, nor is there any need to copy the old to benefit the country\" (Simplified Chinese: \"理世不必一道, 便国不必法古\") and \"Those who use the old to define the new do not achieve change\" (Simplified Chinese: \"以古制今者, 不达于事之变\"). He wore the \"barbaric\" clothes on court and persuaded others to do the same. He even visited Lord Cheng and gave him a suit of the Hu people's clothing. Finally, Lord Cheng relented, and the controversy stopped.\n\nWuling's reforms greatly improved the fighting capability of the Zhao military. The same year, the Zhao attacked the Hu people's state of Zhongshan and took several cities. In 306 BCE the Zhao military launched expeditions into Wuhu territories in the north. The northern expedition was highly successful: the kings of the Loufan and Linhu surrendered and their territories became administered by a governor of Dai. In the next year, parts of Zhongshan were annexed. In 304 BCE the upper reaches of the Yellow River were invaded and taken from the Hu tribes like the Hezong (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 河宗氏) and the Xiu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 休). In the conquered areas King Wuling created two prefectures in 302 BCE - Yunzhong (Simplified Chinese: 云中) and Jiuyuan. In a little over five years Zhao Wuling had expanded his country to the border with the Yan, the upper reaches of the Yellow River and into the north, and had forced two tribal leaders, the Loufan and Linhu kings, to surrender. King Wuling took control of their armies and added them to his military, creating extra divisions made up entirely of indigenous and hardy nomadic warriors.\n\nIn 299 BCE, Zhao Wuling, perhaps tired out from all he had done and wishing to become more involved with military instead of political affairs, abdicated and gave the throne of Zhao to his younger son, Zhao He (Simplified Chinese: 赵何) who was to become King Huiwen of Zhao (Simplified Chinese: 赵惠文王). He called himself the \"Lord Father\" (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 主父), using his new title to visit neighbouring countries, especially the Qin, which he visited secretly. He lived long enough to see the annexation of the Zhongshan by the Zhao in 296 BCE.\n\nIn 295 BCE, Wuling's older son Zhao Zhang (Simplified Chinese: 赵章) rebelled against King Huiwen and lost. He escaped to the palace in Shaqiu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 沙丘), where Zhao Wuling took pity on him and kept him in his palace.\n\nPrime Minister Lord Anping (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 安平君), who was Lord Cheng, the uncle of Wuling, and his subordinate Lord Fengyang (Simplified Chinese: 奉阳君), also known as Li Yu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 李兌) laid siege to the palace, allowing no food or water to be provided to the inhabitants inside. In desperation, King Wuling ordered Zhang to be killed, but still the besiegers did not retreat. Thus, after 100 days, King Wuling starved to death. When the siege was finally lifted, King Wuling's body was already rotting and full of worms, a pitiful ending for such a king.\n\n"}

Plants which flower en masse (gregariously) before dying are known as plietesials.\n\nThe plant can live a number of years before it will flower. Flowering does not by itself result in the death of the plants but the production of fruits and seeds causes changes within the plants which lead to death.

Those that have include \"Strobilanthes\" species, \"Cerberiopsis candelabrum\", \"Tachigali versicolor\" and other \"Tachigali\" species.\n\nOften monocarpic plants can be kept alive after flowering if the flowers are removed as soon as they have finished blooming, before seed formation begins, or if the flower buds are removed before they begin blooming.\n\n"}

According to Tim Donnelly, who prosecuted all the conspirators for this murder, one attorney described Kent as \"very Eddie Haskell-like. Adults saw him one way (polite and charming) while the kids saw him in a completely different way.\"\n\nMarty Puccio is an Italian-American, and was raised Roman Catholic. Kent and Puccio had known each other since third grade, had lived on the same block in Hollywood in Broward County since that time, and were good friends as adults. Bad blood, however, existed between the two. Puccio felt \"ill-will and hatred\" towards Kent because he would bully and pummel Puccio. \n\nBoth sets of parents were wary of the friendship, as well. Puccio's parents, Martin Sr. and Veronica, were cautious because Marty often returned from being with Kent with bruises or bleeding. Fred Kent thought of Puccio as a wayward slacker who had no future (Puccio was a high school dropout) and felt the friendship with his son would destroy the future he was helping him build. Frequent gym goers, both boys were rumored to use steroids, which in Kent's case, according to testimonial accounts, significantly contributed to his erratic, aggressive behavior.\n\nKent and Puccio had experimented with making homosexual porn movies, hoping to distribute them to local shops. Neither Kent nor Puccio actually participated in these movies, but, rather, allegedly directed them and coaxed a Florida man in his 40s to perform on camera. Kent tried to peddle a movie, titled \"Rough Boys\", to porn shops across South Florida. None took him up on the offer, due to the poor audio and video quality as well as the lack of any sexual activities in the film beyond the man dancing nude and playing with a dildo.\n\nToward the beginning of 1993, Puccio (aged 20) began dating Lisa Connelly (aged 18). Frustrated by how much time her boyfriend spent with Kent (aged 20), Connelly tried to distract Kent from Puccio by setting up her friend Alice (Ali) Willis (aged 17) with Kent. Kent and Ali dated for a few weeks but Kent was abusive toward Ali and she cut off the relationship. In June, Puccio confided to Connelly that Kent had been abusive to him quite often over the years. Connelly tried to convince him to cut off his friendship, but Puccio seemed hesitant. By this time, Connelly knew she was pregnant by Puccio and was determined to pursue a permanent relationship with him.\n\nAllegedly, Connelly decided that Kent needed to be eliminated permanently, and began talking to Puccio and other friends about murdering him. On July 13, 1993, Connelly called Willis and told her that \"Bobby Kent was planning to come to Palm Bay [where Willis was living] to murder her and smother her baby [by a previous relationship], unless she returned to Broward County to date him again.\" Willis claimed Connelly asked her to come to Connelly's house to discuss murdering Bobby Kent. Willis went to Connelly's house and brought two friends, her current boyfriend, Donald Semenec (aged 17), and Heather Swallers (aged 18).\n\nOn the night of July 13, 1993, Puccio, Semenec, Swallers, Connelly and Willis met with Kent. Puccio, Semenec, and Swallers became uncomfortable and left. Connelly and Willis lured Kent to a new development under construction with the promise that he would be able to drive Willis's Mustang 5.0 and have sex with her. Connelly had brought along her mother's pistol, intending to kill Kent while he was distracted by sexual activity with Willis. Ultimately, she was unable to go through with shooting him.\n\nDespite the failed attempt, Connelly still wanted Kent dead. Seeking assistance, she contacted a self-proclaimed \"hit man\" named Derek Kaufman (aged 20), who had been recommended by a friend of Willis's. The group met Kaufman at his home in Rolling Oaks. They wanted him to get a gun so they could kill Kent that night, but Kaufman told them he couldn't procure a weapon that quickly. Willis, Connelly, Semenec and Swallers then went back to Connelly's house and were joined by her cousin, Derek Dzvirko (aged 19). The group continued to discuss their plans, and ultimately decided to go ahead with murdering Kent the next night, with Kaufman's assistance. \n\nLate on the night of July 14, 1993, the seven joined together at Puccio's house and finalized their plans. Puccio contacted Kent and convinced him to come out with the group that night, with the promise that they would race their cars and that Willis wanted to have sex with him again. The group assembled their weapons: between them, they had two knives, a lead pipe, and a baseball bat. Around 11:30 p.m., they picked Kent up from his home and headed out to a construction site.\n\nWhen they arrived at the site, Willis—in accordance with the plan—took Kent off to a secluded spot where they were talking. Swallers joined them there. While she and Willis distracted Kent, Semenec came up and stabbed Kent in the neck with a knife, which was the first blow. When Kent asked for Puccio's help, Puccio stuck a knife in his stomach. Kent yelled out an apology, but Puccio continued to stab him. When Kent tried to flee, Puccio, Semenec, and Derek Kaufman followed him and continued wounding him. Puccio then slit Kent's throat and hit his head against the ground. Kaufman then approached and hit Kent in the head with the baseball bat, which was the final blow. After this, Dzvirko, Semenec, Puccio, and Kaufman helped dump Kent's body on the edge of the shore of the marsh, in the belief that alligators would eat the decaying body.\n\nIn the days following the crime, many of the conspirators confessed to various other persons. Connelly confessed to her mother, who contacted her sister, Dzvirko's mother. Together, they took Connelly and Dzvirko to see their brother, Joe Scrima, who had friends in the police department and who they thought would know what to do. Scrima's friends put them in touch with Detective Frank Illaraza of the Broward County Sheriff's Office, and a cooperative Dzvirko confessed everything. As proof, he led Illaraza to Kent's body.\n\n\nThe murder resulted in a best-selling true crime book in 1998, \"Bully: A True Story of High School Revenge\" (), written by Jim Schutze.\nThe book was adapted by David McKenna (credited under the pseudonym \"Zachary Long\" after he demanded his name be removed from the film) and Roger Pullis into the 2001 film \"Bully\", directed by Larry Clark.\nThe story was also covered during an episode of the A&E series \"American Justice\" as well as \"Forensic Files\", and, more recently, Investigation Discovery's \"Murder Among Friends\".\n\nIn the film, Puccio was portrayed by Brad Renfro, Kent was portrayed by Nick Stahl, Willis was portrayed by Bijou Phillips, Connelly was portrayed by Rachel Miner, Semenec was portrayed by Michael Pitt, Swallers was portrayed by Kelli Garner, Dzvirko was portrayed by Daniel Franzese, and Kaufman was portrayed by Leo Fitzpatrick.\n\n\n"}

Northern brook lamprey are considered non-parasitic lamprey. They have poorly developed teeth and a round, disc-like, subterminal mouth, called an oral-disc, for suction. Northern brook lampreys have a single dorsal fin that continues along their entire length until it connects with the caudal fin. This dorsal fin can be notched as well. Their coloration is gray-brown dorsally with a light line down the back and an even lighter ventral side. The length of adult northern brook lampreys does not typically exceed 16 cm and the body is attenuate. While the ammocoetes look similar to the adult lampreys the ammocoetes have a hooded mouth instead of an oral-disc and no eyes.\n\nNorthern brook lampreys can be found in most of the Midwest and northeast regions of the United States. They inhabit the Mississippi drainage basin in Wisconsin and the Lake Erie tributary in New York. They can be found in parts of Canada as well.\n\nThe northern brook lampreys are found in various habitats throughout their lives. Ammocoetes start off their lives burrowed beneath fine sediment or organic matter in quiet waters while the adults live in sand or gravel in swift moving waters. They are typically found in the headwaters of streams that are moderately warm and clean.\n\nAs larve (ammocoetes), the northern brook lamprey are filter feeders; feeding primarily on detritus, zooplankton, algae, diatoms, bacteria, pollen and a host of other microorganisms as they remain burrowed in fine substrate in calm waters. The juveniles and adults have non-functional intestines and do not feed; juveniles drift for 4–6 months and the adults spawn and die shortly after spawning.\n\nSpawning occurs around boulders and crevices of large rocks; 3-7 northern brook lamprey will build a nest together and then spawn in groups of 10-30. Once the eggs are fertilized they are often covered and left alone with no parental care given to the young, as the lamprey die soon after. Northern brook lampreys begin spawning at 6 years of age once they have reached sexual maturity. Spawning is triggered by the warming of the water in the spring. Males begin building nests and females lay thousands of eggs to combat high mortality rates of young.\nOnce the ammocoetes emerge from the eggs 2 weeks after fertilization, they spend the next 5–6 years feeding on algae and bacteria in burrows. They emerge in the fall as non-feeding juveniles after a 2-3 month metamorphosis and drift for 4–6 months until spawning begins. They then become sexually mature adults, partake in spawning and then die shortly thereafter.\n\nNorthern brook lamprey populations are decreasing in the great lakes area and the great lakes drainage basin from lampricides, habitat degradation, and added stressors. A study of Pennsylvania streams found that two of the six species of lampreys normally found breeding in the streams were not there. One of the species not found was the northern brook lamprey. It is speculated that the main reason for population decline is due to the presence of sea lamprey and the lampricides used to be rid of them. In Minnesota, northern brook lampreys are considered a special concern species as they are believed to be declining due to lampricide use and habitat degradation. The lampricide treatments are used in response to the invasive species, sea lampreys, that are currently plaguing the great lake region. The increasing populations of sea lampreys and the increasing use of lampricides in response to sea lampreys has had negative impacts on most populations of lampreys, including the northern brook lamprey.\n\n"}
{"id": "1113569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1113569", "title": "Polish Operation of the NKVD", "text": "Polish Operation of the NKVD\n\nThe Polish Operation of the Soviet security service in 1937–1938 was a mass operation of the NKVD carried out in the Soviet Union against Poles (labeled by the Soviets as \"agents\") during the period of the Great Purge. It was ordered by the Politburo against the so-called \"Polish spies\" and customarily interpreted by the NKVD officials as relating to 'absolutely all Poles'. It resulted in the sentencing of 139,835 people, and summary executions of 111,091 Poles. The operation was implemented according to NKVD Order № 00485 signed by Nikolai Yezhov. The majority of the shooting victims were ethnically Polish, but not all, wrote Timothy Snyder. The remainder were 'suspected' of being Polish, without further inquiry, or classed as possibly having pro-Polish sympathies. In order to speed up the process the NKVD personnel reviewed local telephone books and arrested persons with Polish-sounding names.\n\nThe Polish Operation was the largest ethnic shooting and deportation action during the Great Terror campaign of political murders in the Soviet Union, orchestrated by Nikolai Yezhov.<ref name=\"B/E/F\"></ref> It is also the largest killing of Poles in history outside any armed conflict.\n\nThe top secret NKVD Order No. 00485, titled \"\"On the liquidation of the Polish diversionist and espionage groups and POW units\",\" was approved on August 9, 1937 by the Party's Central Committee Politburo, and was signed by Nikolai Yezhov on August 11, 1937. It was distributed to the local subdivisions of the NKVD simultaneously with Yezhov's thirty-page \"secret letter,\" explaining what the \"Polish operation\" was all about. The letter from Yezhov was titled, \"On fascist-resurrectionist, spying, diversional, defeationist, and terrorist activity of Polish intelligence in the USSR\". Stalin demanded the NKVD to \"keep on digging out and cleaning out this Polish filth.\"\nThe \"Order\" adopted the simplified so-called \"album procedure\" (as it was called in NKVD circles). The long lists of Poles condemned by a lower NKVD organ (so-called \"dvoika\", a two-man team) during early meetings, were then collected into \"albums\" and sent to the midrange NKVD offices for a stamp of approval by a \"troika\" (a three-man team; a communist official, NKVD leader, and party procurator). Poles were the first ever major Soviet population group to be sentenced in this manner. After the approval of the entire \"album\", the executions were carried out immediately. This procedure was also used later on in other mass operations of the NKVD.\n\nThe \"Polish Operation\" was a second in a series of national operations of the NKVD, carried out by the Soviet Union against ethnic groups including Latvian, Finnish, German and Romanian, based on a theory about an internal enemy (i.e. the fifth column) labelled as the \"hostile capitalist surrounding\" residing along its western borders. In opinion of historian Timothy Snyder, this fabricated justification was intended only to cover-up the state-sanctioned campaign of mass-murder aiming to eradicate Poles as a national (and linguistic) minority group. Another possible cause according to Snyder might have sprung from the necessity to explain the Soviet-made famine in Ukraine which required a political scapegoat. A top Soviet official Vsevolod Balitsky chose the Polish Military Organization which was disbanded in 1921. The NKVD declared that it continued to exist. Some Soviet Poles were tortured in order to confess to its existence, and denounce other individuals as spies. Meanwhile, the Communist International helped by revisiting its files in search of Polish members, producing another bountiful source of made-up evidence.\n\nThe operation took place approximately from August 25, 1937 to November 15, 1938. The largest group of people with Polish background, around 40 percent of all victims, came from the Soviet Ukraine, especially from the districts near the border with Poland. Among them were tens of thousands of peasants, railway workers, industrial labourers, engineers and others. An additional 17 percent of victims came from the Soviet Byelorussia. The rest came from around Western Siberia and Kazakhstan, where exiled Poles had lived since the Partitions, as well as from the southern Urals, northern Caucasus and the rest of Siberia, including the Far East.\n\nThe following categories of people were arrested by the NKVD during its Polish operation, as described in Soviet documents:\n\nAccording to archives of the NKVD: 111,091 Poles and people accused of ties with Poland, were sentenced to death, and 28,744 were sentenced to labor camps (known as the \"dry guillotine\" of slow death by exposure, malnutrition, and overwork); 139,835 victims in total. This number constitutes 10% of the total number of people officially convicted during the Yezhovshchina period, based on confirming NKVD documents.\n\nThe Operation was only a peak in the persecution of the Poles, which spanned more than a decade. As the Soviet statistics indicate, the number of ethnic Poles in the USSR dropped by 165,000 in that period. \"It is estimated that Polish losses in the Ukrainian SSR were about 30%, while in the Belorussian SSR... the Polish minority was almost completely annihilated.\"\n\nTimothy Snyder gives a conservative estimate of 85,000 confirmed Poles executed simultaneously across the country.\n\nAlmost all victims of the NKVD shootings were men, wrote Michał Jasiński, most with families. Their wives and children were dealt with by the NKVD Order № 00486. The women were generally sentenced to deportation to Kazakhstan for an average of 5 to 10 years. Their children were put in orphanages to be brought up as Soviet, with no knowledge of their origins. All possessions of the accused were confiscated. The parents of the executed men – as well as their in-laws – were purposely left with nothing to live on, which usually sealed their fate as well. Statistical extrapolation, wrote Jasiński, increases the number of Polish victims in 1937–1938 to around 200–250,000 depending on size of their families.\n\nIn Leningrad, the NKVD reviewed local telephone books and arrested almost 7,000 citizens with Polish-sounding name with the vast majority of such nominal \"suspects\" were executed within 10 days of arrest.\n\nHistorian Michael Ellman asserts that the \"national operations\", particularly the \"Polish Operation\", may have constituted genocide as defined by the UN convention. His opinion is shared by Simon Sebag Montefiore, who calls the Polish operation of the NKVD \"a mini-genocide\". Polish writer and commentator, Dr Tomasz Sommer, also refers to the operation as a genocide, along with Prof. Marek Jan Chodakiewicz among others.\n\n"}
{"id": "1297768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1297768", "title": "Political repression", "text": "Political repression\n\nPolitical repression is the persecution of an individual or group within society for political reasons, particularly for the purpose of restricting or preventing their ability to take part in the political life of a society thereby reducing their standing among their fellow citizens.\n\nPolitical repression is sometimes used synonymously with the term political discrimination (also known as politicism). It often is manifested through discriminatory policies, such as human rights violations, surveillance abuse, police brutality, imprisonment, involuntary settlement, stripping of citizen's rights, lustration and violent action or terror such as the murder, summary executions, torture, forced disappearance and other extrajudicial punishment of political activists, dissidents, or general population. Political repression can also be reinforced by means outside of written policy, such as by public and private media ownership and by self-censorship within the public.\n\nWhere political repression is sanctioned and organised by the state, it may constitute state terrorism, genocide, politicide or crimes against humanity. Systemic and violent political repression is a typical feature of dictatorships, totalitarian states and similar regimes. Acts of political repression may be carried out by secret police forces, army, paramilitary groups or death squads. Repressive activities have also been found within democratic contexts as well. This can even include setting up situations where the death of the target of repression is the end result.\n\nIf political repression is not carried out with the approval of the state, a section of government may still be responsible. An example is the FBI COINTELPRO operations in the United States between 1956 and 1971.\n\nIn some states, \"repression\" can be an official term used in legislation or the names of government institutions. For example, the Soviet Union had a legal policy of repression of political opposition defined in the penal code and Cuba under Fulgencio Batista had a secret police agency officially named the \"Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities\".\n\nPolitical conflict strongly increases the likelihood of state repression. This is arguably the most robust finding in social science research on political repression – civil wars are a strong predictor of repressive activity, as are other forms of challenges from non-government actors. States so often engage in repressive behaviors in times of civil conflict that the relationship between these two phenomena has been termed the \"Law of Coercive Responsiveness\". When their authority or legitimacy is threatened, regimes respond by overtly or covertly suppressing dissidents to eliminate the behavioral threat. State repression subsequently affects dissident mobilization, though the direction of this effect is still an open question. Some strong evidence suggests that repression suppresses dissident mobilization by reducing the capacity of challengers to organize, yet it is also feasible that challengers can leverage state repressive behavior to spur mobilization among sympathizers by framing repression as a new grievance against the state.\n\nPolitical repression is often accompanied by violence, which might be legal or illegal according to domestic law. Violence can both eliminate political opposition directly by killing opposition members, or indirectly by instilling fear.\nPolitical repression is sometimes synonymous with political, ideological, religious and social discrimination and intolerance. This intolerance is manifested through discriminatory policies, human rights violations, police brutality, imprisonment, extermination, exile, extortion, terrorism, extrajudicial killing, summary execution, torture, forced disappearance and other punishments against political activists, dissidents, and population in general.\n\nWhen political repression is sanctioned and organized by the state, situations of state terrorism, genocide and crimes against humanity can be reached. Systematic and violent political repression is a typical feature of dictatorships, totalitarianisms and similar regimes. In these regimes, acts of political repression can be carried out by the police and secret police, the army, paramilitary groups and death squads. Sometimes regimes considered democratic exercise political repression and state terrorism to other states as part of their security policy.\n\nArticles\nJournals\nBooks\n"}

Immediately following the removal of President Mohamed Morsi by the Egyptian Armed Forces on 3 July 2013 amid demonstrations against Morsi's rule, many protesters amassed near the Rabia Al-Adawiya Mosque to call for Morsi's return to power and condemn the military, while others demonstrated in support of the military and interim government. Deadly clashes such as Rabaa massacre continued for several days, with three particularly bloody incidents being described by Muslim Brotherhood officials as \"massacres\" perpetrated by security forces. During the month of Ramadan (10 July – 7 August), prime minister Hazem al-Beblawy threatened to disperse the ongoing Pro-Morsi sit-ins in Rabaa al-Adaweya square and al-Nahda square. The government crackdown of these protests occurred in a violent dispersal on 14 August 2013. In mid-August, the violence directed by the army towards the protesters escalated, with hundreds killed, and the government declaring a month-long nighttime curfew.\n\nProtests against President Hosni Mubarak in early 2011 led to his resignation and trial after the Egyptian military switched its allegiance to the demonstrators. Mubarak's downfall was only the second revolution in the Arab world of the revolutionary wave known as the Arab Spring.\n\nVice President Omar Suleiman, who announced Mubarak's resignation in February 2011, handed power to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. Egypt came under martial law as top generals led by Mohamed Hussein Tantawi began directing Egypt toward democratic elections. This period was marked by further conflict and continuing protests, as demonstrators who had cheered the support of the military in removing Mubarak turned against the generals when they began imposing harsh security measures and tamping down on revolutionary activity. The Muslim Brotherhood emerged as a leading voice in criticizing military rule.\n\nAn Islamist-dominated parliament was elected in late 2011 and early 2012. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces dissolved the body in June 2012, saying many of the elections were illegitimate.\n\nPresidential elections were held in mid-2012. No candidate garnered as much as a quarter of the vote in the first round of elections. The top two candidates advanced to the runoff: Mohamed Morsi of the Freedom and Justice Party, the candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Ahmed Shafik, an independent candidate who served as prime minister of Egypt under Mubarak. Morsi strongly criticized the Mubarak regime and offered a vision for Egypt as an Islamic democracy, while Shafik, a secularist, promised to restore order. Morsi ultimately prevailed in the runoff, defeating Shafik by a margin of 3.5 percentage points. While Islamists hailed Morsi's election with enthusiasm, many Copts and liberals viewed the runoff as a choice between two unappealing candidates.\n\nMorsi reinstated parliament days after his election, and lawmakers set to work drafting a constitution. The constitution was passed over the objections of opposition members who argued the process was faulty. When put to a referendum in December 2012, the constitution was approved by a nearly 28-point margin, as supporters successfully argued that approval of the constitution was needed to ensure stability.\n\nHowever, Morsi's government faced popular protests after the president decreed in November 2012 that he had vast powers that could not be checked by the courts. Protesters called for Morsi to withdraw his constitutional declaration or resign from office. Within weeks, Morsi annulled the declaration, days before the constitution itself was approved by voters.\n\nProtests against Morsi continued throughout the first half of 2013, whipping up in June 2013 briefly after the president appointed an Islamist accused of involvement in the Luxor massacre to head the Luxor Governorate and culminating in mass demonstrations that began on 30 June. Protesters criticized Morsi for alleged mismanagement of the country and for the growing influence of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Tamarod movement, which translates into English as \"Rebel\", claimed it had gathered 22 million signatures from Egyptians opposed to Morsi. According to some sources, the protests were the largest in Egypt's history.\n\nThe Egyptian Armed Forces again sided with demonstrators against the regime, warning Morsi to respond to protesters' demands or face a \"political road map\" widely expected to involve the president's removal from office. Despite this, Morsi remained defiant, giving a speech on 2 July insisting he was the legitimate president and would sooner die than relinquish power. The next day, Defence Minister Abdul Fatah al-Sisi informed Morsi that he was no longer president and addressed the country on television to announce the change in leadership.\n\nIndications on 6 July 2013 that Mohamed ElBaradei would be sworn in as prime minister proved to be incorrect. The next day, a founding member of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party named Ziad Bahaa El-Din was reportedly offered the post of Prime Minister, while ElBaradei was nominated as vice president. Younes Makhioun, chairman of the Nour Party, objected to both appointments because both of them belong to the same political coalition (the National Salvation Front); he called for nominees who were \"politically neutral\" instead. The Nour Party rejected El-Din on 7 July 2013 and pulled out of the transitional process altogether on 8 July 2013 because of the 2013 Republican Guard Headquarters clashes. However, the party has advised the interim government on ministerial candidates, including Ahmed Darwish. Hazem Al Beblawi was sworn in as prime minister on 9 July 2013 with the backing of the Nour Party.\n\nOn 3 July, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, head of the Egyptian Armed Forces, announced that he there would be calling new presidential and Shura Council elections. The coalition appointed Chief Justice Adly Mansour as the interim president and charged him with forming a transitional technocratic government. Military vehicles drove throughout Cairo. Morsi was put under house arrest, and was believed to be at the Republican Guard barracks. According to other sources he was taken to a military base and his travel was restricted. Army troops and tanks were reported to have surrounded key facilities and installations. At noon, the Republican Guard, who had Morsi in their care, left his side to allow Army commandos to take him to an undisclosed Ministry of Defence building. He offered no resistance.\n\nGeneral al-Sisi said: \"The president's speech last night failed to meet and conform with the demands [of the people, prompting the armed forces to consult] with some of the symbols of the national forces and the youths without excluding anyone. [They agreed on a road map] that includes initial steps that realize the building of a strong and coherent Egyptian society that does not exclude any of its sons and currents and that end the state of conflict and division.\" He added the army was standing apart from the political process but was using its vision as the Egyptian people were calling for help and discharged its responsibility. Al-Sisi named former Chief Justice Adli Mansour as the interim president and added that he would be sworn in on 4 July. The Shura Council was also dissolved.\nMorsi condemned his removal as a \"full coup\" by the general. He also urged everyone to \"adhere to peacefulness and avoid shedding blood of fellow countrymen.\"\nThe Office of Assistant to President of Egypt on Foreign Relations called Morsi's removal a \"military coup\", and said \"there is no democracy without the ballot box\".\n\nThe announcement of the removal of Morsi was met with cheers in Tahrir Square. Anti-Morsi protesters shouted \"Allahu akbar\" and \"Long live Egypt\" and launched fireworks as green laser lights held by those in the crowd lit the sky. Mohamed el-Baradei says the coup was to rectify the issues of the revolution. The Coptic Pope Tawadros II, Grand Imam of al-Azhar Ahmed el-Tayeb, Mohamed ElBaradei and some of the youth leaders of Tamarod, Mahmoud Badr and Mohamed Abdelaziz, spoke in support of the military intervention. The al-Nour party also commented in saying that the events occurred as they were not heard in their call for dialogue. Party Secretary-General Galal Murra commented that: \"we took this position (on agreeing to the army political road map) and we took these decisions only so we stop the bloodshed of our people.\" Pro-Morsi protesters heard a statement from Morsi, which was published on his Facebook page. He called the move a \"coup\" and rejected the Armed Forces' statement.\n\nThe Freedom and Justice Party's Gamal Heshmat said: \"There is absolutely no direction towards violence. The Brotherhood are not raised on violence. Their cause is a peaceful one, defending their rights, which is stronger than a \"military coup\". The army has perpetrated a \"shameful coup\". We are still in the street, we still don't know if all of the armed forces will accept what Sisi has done.\" A party spokesman said that what started as a military coup was \"turning into something much more.\" The National Salvation Front, an alliance of multiple political parties, stated on 4 July that \"what Egypt is witnessing now is not a military coup by any standards. It was a necessary decision that the Armed Forces' leadership took to protect democracy, maintain the country's unity and integrity, restore stability and get back on track towards achieving the goals of the January 25 Revolution.\"\n\nAdly Mansour, chief justice of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, was sworn in as interim president. Mansour gave a speech in which he praised demonstrators for toppling the government, saying, \"I offer my greetings to the revolutionary people of Egypt.\"\n\nViolence continued with over 100 people wounded and at least two deaths, believed to be that of children. The Muslim Brotherhood's spokesman called for \"strictly peaceful\" protests to defy (according to his description) the military coup.\n\nMuslim Brotherhood members and sympathizers rallied across Egypt for what they dubbed a \"Friday of Rejection\" on 5 July, demanding the reinstatement of Morsi as president. Clashes with police and soldiers turned deadly in some areas, with reported instances of troops firing live ammunition into crowds of protesters. At least 36 were killed and more than 1,000 were injured. Protesters reportedly attacked a police station and military airbase in the North Sinai Governorate, as well as the governorate headquarters, resulting in casualties on both sides.\n\nPalestinian officials in Gaza also said that the Egyptian Armed Forces had shut the Rafah border crossing and that only certain people, such as patients and students, would be allowed through. Egyptian Intelligence Service official Nader al-Asar telephoned Palestinian Prime Minister in Gaza Ismail Haniyeh on the afternoon of 5 July and Haniyeh briefed him about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as a result of the restrictions on tunnels and the Rafah crossing.\n\nLeaders from the protest movement Tamarod and the National Salvation Front urged demonstrators to \"protect their revolutionary legitimacy\" and resist unnamed \"foreign forces\" and supporters of Morsi who might stage a \"counter-revolution\" in Egypt. Police also announced the arrest of Khairat El-Shater, a figure in the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nMohamed ElBaradei was reportedly appointed prime minister by acting President Mansour, over the objections of Islamists. The announcement of ElBaradei's appointment was later retracted, with a spokesman for the president saying no decision had been made on whether ElBaradei or somebody else would be named prime minister. Ahmed Douma, a dissident jailed for \"insulting\" President Morsi and inciting violence against the Muslim Brotherhood during protests earlier in the year, was released from custody pending a court verdict. Meanwhile, clashes continued on the Sinai Peninsula, with a Coptic Christian priest shot to death by masked gunmen. Pro-Morsi supporters continued their sit-in in front of the Rabia Al-Adawiya Mosque in Nasr City, a suburb of Cairo, demanding the reinstatement of the former president.\n\nNegotiations continued over the prime ministerial appointment, with reports suggesting the Al-Nour Party had objected to ElBaradei's appointment and representatives of the Tamarod movement continuing to push for it. Meanwhile, a message from Mohammed Badie appeared on the Muslim Brotherhood's Facebook page accusing coup leaders of \"flagrant violations against the Egyptian people\", those opposed to the rule of Morsi mobilized for another day of rallying in Tahrir Square. Huge demonstrations against the military coup, also occurred in manned makeshift roadblocks in Cairo and the Nasr City suburb in Cairo.\n\nMuslim Brotherhood sources alleged 54 pro-Morsi demonstrators were killed when police fired on their sit-in during dawn prayers. According to the army, \"terrorists\" tried to storm the compound, leading to the death of an officer. MP Mohamed Beltagy described the incident as a \"massacre\" during dawn prayers. After the incident, the Freedom and Justice Party, called for \"the international community and international groups and all the free people of the world [to] intervene to stop further massacres [...] and prevent a new Syria in the Arab world.\" At the same time, Morsi supporters were said by the military of having forced two soldiers, Samir Abdallah Ali and Azzam Hazem Ali, to make pro-Morsi statements on a loudspeaker and that one of them was \"severely beaten up\" and filmed while making the statements. However, an army official later said that they had \"managed to escape their captors.\"\n\nThe Nour Party announced it would not participate in the political transition due to the \"massacre\", and former Muslim Brotherhood member, moderate Islamist, and 2012 presidential candidate Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh called for Mansour to resign. Meanwhile, Mansour issued a proposed timetable for elections to occur within six months.\n\nFollowing reports that many fighters in Syria were returning in support of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt placed restrictions on Syrians entering the country and required them to obtain visas before entering the country.\n\nAmnesty International urged the Egyptian government to probe the \"massacre\" of the previous day. The army continued to deny it used excessive force, claiming police and troops responded to aggression by armed protesters. Tamarod posted on Twitter that \"Mansour's maneuvers will create a new dictatorship\", rejecting the proposed election timetable. Mohamed ElBaradei and Hazem Al Beblawi were named vice president and prime minister for the interim government respectively by Mansour.\n\nRamadan began in Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhood again rejected overtures to participate in the transitional government. Arrest warrants were issued for Mohammed Badie and other top Muslim Brotherhood officials. The Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California at Berkeley reported that a State Department programme ostensibly to support democracy provided funds to activists and politicians for fomenting unrest in Egypt after the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011.\n\nThe United States formally placed financial aid to Egypt under review.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood vowed to continue its resistance to the military's ouster of Morsi. In a statement it disavowed itself from an assassination attempt against a senior army commander in the Sinai Peninsula on 10 July and said it adheres to peaceful measures. The statement also read: \"We will continue our peaceful resistance to the bloody military coup against constitutional legitimacy. We trust that the peaceful and popular will of the people shall triumph over force and oppression.\"\n\nPublic prosecutor Hisham Barakat issued a temporary freeze on the assets of senior leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, as well as senior members of the National Coalition for Supporting Legitimacy, pending investigations in ongoing cases related to events in al-Mokatam, al-Nahda square and the Republican Guards Club. The freeze affects the senior Muslim Brotherhood leaders Mohammed Badie, Khairat el-Shater, Mohamed Ezat, Mahi Ekef, Saad El-Katatni, Essam el-Erian and Mohamed Beltagy, as well as the politicians Essam Sultan, Assem Abdul Majed, Safwat Hegazy and Hazem Abu Ismail.\n\nOn 13 July, Egyptian prosecutors announced a criminal investigation of Morsi for \"spying, inciting violence and ruining the economy\". Two days later, General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi spoke on state television for the first time since the coup to defend the army's actions. Mohamed ElBaradei was also sworn in as interim vice president the same day, while the assets of 14 prominent Islamists, including Mohammed Badie, were frozen. At least three were also killed and 17 others were wounded in North Sinai when suspected militants fired rocket-propelled grenades at a worker bus.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood continued its call for more protests after Friday prayers. The protests were held in Cairo and Alexandria with two formations of fighter jets flying over both cities after noon prayers ended as well as military helicopters that flew low over roof tops in the city. Amongst the tens of thousands of protesters present, they chanted \"Islamic, Islamic\" in calling for an Islamic state.\n\nOn 22 July, protests in Cairo led to two deaths at a pro-Morsi rally as unknown gunmen opened fire on demonstrators. A bomb also killed a conscript and injured 15 at a police station in Mansoura. Morsi's family also accused the military of kidnapping him.\n\nThe United States called on Egypt's army to free deposed President Mohamed Morsi, amid ongoing protests on the first Friday of Ramadan. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Joseph Burns, the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Egypt since Morsi's ouster, visited Cairo to meet with representatives of the interim government. Representatives from both Tamarod and the Nour Party refused to meet with Burns, with Tamarod accusing the U.S. of interfering with Egyptian internal affairs. The U.S. also delayed the delivery of F-16 Fighting Falcons from Fort Worth, Texas, to Egypt due to \"political reasons.\"\n\nA bomb exploded at a police station in the Egyptian city of Mansoura, the capital of the Dakahlia Governorate, killing at least one person and injuring 17.\n\nDuring a speech at a military parade, General Al-Sisi called for mass demonstrations on 26 July to grant his forces a \"mandate\" to crack down on \"terrorism\", an apparent reference to the bombing at Mansoura and to restive Islamists continuing to oppose the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi. This was seen as contradicting the military's pledges to hand over power to civilians after removing Dr. Morsi and as an indication for an imminent crackdown against Islamists.\n\nThe reactions to Al-Sisi's announcement ranged from open support by the Egyptian presidency and the Tamarod movement to rejection, not only by the Muslim Brotherhood, who called the announcement \"an invitation to civil war\", but also by the Salafi Al-Nour Party, the Strong Egypt Party, the revolutionary April 6 Youth Movement and the Egyptian Human Rights groups.\n\nIn response to General Al-Sisi's call, millions of protesters took part in demonstrations across the country in support of the army including tens of thousands in Cairo's Tahrir Square and at the Presidential Palace. At the same time, smaller demonstrations (thousands of protestors) rallied in Nasr City and at Cairo University in protest at the military coup. While the demonstrations in Cairo were largely peaceful, five people including a 14-year-old boy were killed and at least 146 injured in Alexandria, when a pro-army march passed near a demonstration of Morsi supporters at Al-Qaed Ibrahim Mosque. The Health Ministry confirmed a total of nine people killed during protests in Alexandria.\n\nIn Sphinx Square in Mohandessin, a group of activists called The Third Square, who mistrust both the military and the Islamists, held their own protest. In a leaflet, they declared their opposition to \"the defense minister calling for an authorization to kill Egyptians on the pretext of fighting terrorism\".\n\nIn a separate development, Egyptian state media announced that deposed President Morsi was being investigated for conspiring with the Palestinian group Hamas in relation to a prison breakout in 2011.\n\nAt least 82 were killed early in the morning after security forces opened fire on pro-Morsi demonstrators on a road near the Rabaa Al-Adawiya Mosque, a centre of resistance to the military coup. The health ministry said 82 were confirmed dead and 299 injured, while doctors at the field hospital said at least 200 protesters had been killed and 4,500 injured. A Brotherhood spokesman said police used live ammunition and shot to kill.\n\nInterior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim said police had been forced to intervene after demonstrators clashed with locals while trying to block a major bridge. He claimed that police did not use live ammunition and attempted to disperse protesters with tear gas. However, multiple photos on the internet show clearly the police and army forces using live ammunition and automatic guns. Meanwhile, Al-Nour Party leader Younis Makhyoun called for a full investigation into the incident, which the Brotherhood described as a \"massacre\", and angry activists chanted violent slogans calling for Sisi to be executed during pro-Morsi protests during the day.\n\nTwo days later, the United States White House released a statement that read it \"strongly condemns the bloodshed and violence\" in Cairo and Alexandria, while calling on the military-backed interim government to respect the rights of demonstrators.\n\nOn 30 July, a member of the Palestinian movement Hamas' named Salah al-Bardaweel said that it had documentary proof that the interim government was colluding with its Palestinian rivals, Fatah and the Palestinian National Authority, in pushing forward a malicious agenda to tarnish the group, while it also denied involvement in the Egypt protests following the coup. Fatah termed the documents as \"fabrications\" in rejecting the allegations.\n\nThe next day, the interim cabinet warned that it would use any measures to deal with the pro-Morsi protesters' sit-in in dispersing them.\n\nOn 11 August, efforts by the international community to end the standoff and find a peaceful resolution to the crisis failed. Egypt's prime minister warned just ahead of the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday that ends Sunday that the government's decision to clear the sit-ins was \"irreversible.\"\n\nOn 12 August, supporters of toppled president Mohamed Morsi increased the pressure on Egypt's interim leadership by defiantly flooding into two protest camps Monday, prompting police to postpone moving against the 6-week-old sit-ins to \"avoid bloodshed\" and delayed taking any action. The Interior Ministry has depicted the encampments as a public danger, saying 11 bodies bearing signs of torture were found near both sites. Amnesty International has also reported that anti-Morsi protesters have been captured, beaten, subjected to electric shocks or stabbed. At least eight bodies have arrived at a morgue in Cairo bearing signs of torture, the human rights group said.\n\nOn 13 August, Egyptian interim President Adly Mansour appointed 18 new provincial governors, many of them former military officers, removing all Muslim Brotherhood members who had been in office, triggering a wave of criticism from groups and activists who decried the appointments of mainly former security officials to the posts. According to \"The Economist\" a number of those newly appointed governors \"had glaring records of hostility to the 2011 revolution.\"\nShortly after dawn on 14 August, Egyptian police raided two large encampments by supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi in Cairo to forcibly disperse them, after six weeks of unauthorized sit-in, sparking deadly clashes that drew global condemnation from world states. The Egyptian government announced a one-month state of emergency as a result of the deadly clashes. A spokesman for Egypt's health ministry said the death toll has reached 638 of which 595 are civilians and 43 police officers with at least 3,994 injured. Additionally according to workers at the Al Iman mosque, over 200 bodies, which had been moved from a protest camp nearby, are not included in the official Health Ministry tally. The Muslim Brotherhood has said the true death toll was far higher, with a spokesman saying 2,000 people had been killed in the \"massacre\". Among the dead was the daughter of Mohamed el-Beltagy, a prominent lawmaker. Four journalists were killed and several others were injured or arrested. Egyptian Vice President Mohamed ElBaradei resigned on the same day following the violent actions by security forces against the protesters.\n\nOn 15 August, following the security forces raids on Cairo protest camps held by supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi, churches across Egypt came under frenzied attack Thursday as Morsi loyalists allegedly orchestrated nationwide assaults on Christian targets throughout the country. It's estimated that as many as 36 churches were \"completely\" devastated by fire across nine Egyptian governorates and many other churches were looted or stormed. Egypt's army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi pledged the military would cover the costs of restoration for all damaged churches. Morsi's Islamist backers also set dozens of police stations ablaze across Egypt and attempted to storm provincial governor offices following Wednesday's bloody crackdown. A group of Morsi supporters also set fire to the finance ministry building in Cairo's Nasr City district.\n\nThe unrest led the interim government to declare a month-long state of emergency, with a daily curfew between 7:00pm and 6:00am in Cairo and 12 other governorates.\n\nSeveral episodes of clashes are reported in Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities. The interim Interior Minister authorized the police agents and the military to shoot on sight anyone who is involved in unrests. All touristic attractions and antiquities museums are closed all over the country, many suffering looting episodes.\n\nThe army blocked all major streets and squares, among which, Tahrir Square. The early clashes caused many deaths, at least 80 in Cairo, 5 in Fayoum, 10 in Ismailia, 8 in Damietta and at least 1 in Al Arish.\n\nOn 16 August Ammar Badie, the son of Mohammed Badie, was among the 173 killed in clashes that were part of a Muslim Brotherhood orchestrated \"Day of Rage\".\n\nOn 17 August, security forces cleared a Cairo mosque after a standoff with anti-government protesters barricaded inside. The confrontation at the al-Fath mosque continued for most of Saturday—with exchanges of gunfire between security forces and protesters.\n\nOn 18 August, a convoy carrying about 600 detainees to Abu Zaabal prison near Cairo resulted in at least 35 deaths. The interior ministry said that the detainees tried to escape from the convoy and took an officer hostage. They then said that police fired tear gas back at them and the detainees died as a result of suffocation. However, the Muslim Brotherhood disputed the claim and said that its supporters were killed in cold blood and called for an international inquiry into the incident.\n\n25 Egyptian policemen died on 19 August in an attack in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula by militant Islamists.\n\nIn all, nearly 1,000 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsi during 14–18 August.\n\nOn 19 August, the government banned vigilante groups known as \"people's committees\" that are armed with clubs, sticks and guns and have appeared on Egyptian streets as of mid-August 2013.\n\nOn 5 September 2013, interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim Moustafa was the target of an assassination attempt; the attempt failed, though 21 people were injured and one person died.\n\nOne police officer was killed in Giza in an Islamist dominated town, more than 50 Islamists were arrested on the crackdown.\n\nOn 6 October 2013, at least 57 were killed and 393 injured across the country when anti-coup protesters and security forces clashed amid celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the start of the 1973 Mideast war with Israel. Pitched battles were fought for hours in some Cairo neighborhoods, where 48 of the 57 fatalities occurred. Residents reported areas of the city looked like combat zones, with tires burning and thick black smoke rising over the streets.\n\nViolence continued on 7 October, as unidentified gunmen attacked an Army convoy west of Ismailiya, near the Suez Canal, killing all six passengers, including an officer and a lieutenant. Shortly before that a suicide bomber attacked the security headquarters in the Southern Sinai capital of El-Tor, killing three and injuring at least 55. In addition, two rocket-propelled grenades hit a major satellite station in the affluent Cairo suburb of Maadi, causing some damage, but no casualties.\n\nOn 15 November, two teenagers were killed in Friday clashes as the curfew was removed.\n\nOn 19 November, revolutionaries clashed with military supporters in the second anniversary of the Mohamed Mahmoud massacre that killed 61 in three days.

They are convicted for killing of a police officer and attacking on people and property. A spokesman of Muslim Brotherhood questioned the unprecedented speedy trial and said the verdict came from a Kangaroo court. The spokesman also pointed that the sentences showed a comeback of dictatorship to Egypt. The interim government launched a severe crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood following the 2013 coup. All the sentenced persons are supporters of Muslim Brotherhood and ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi.

{"id": "2570531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2570531", "title": "Puruṣārtha", "text": "Puruṣārtha\n\nAll four \"Purusarthas\" are important, but in cases of conflict, \"Dharma\" is considered more important than \"Artha\" or \"Kama\" in Hindu philosophy. \"Moksha\" is considered the ultimate ideal of human life. At the same time, this is not a consensus among all Hindus, and many have different interpretations of the hierarchy, and even as to whether one should exist.\n\nHistorical Indian scholars recognized and debated the inherent tension between active pursuit of wealth (Artha purusartha) and pleasure (Kama), and renunciation of all wealth and pleasure for the sake of spiritual liberation (Moksha). They proposed \"action with renunciation\" or \"craving-free, dharma-driven action\", also called \"Nishkam Karma\" as a possible solution to the tension.\n\n\"Puruṣartha\" (पुरुषार्थ) is a composite Sanskrit word from \"Purusha\" (पुरुष) and \"Artha\" (अर्थ). \"Purusha\" means \"human being\", \"soul\" as well as \"universal principle and soul of the universe\". \"Artha\" in one context means \"purpose\", \"object of desire\" and \"meaning\". Together, \"Purusartha\" literally means \"purpose of human being\" or \"object of human pursuit\".\n\nAlf Hiltebeitel translates \"Purusartha\" as \"Goals of Man\". Prasad clarifies that \"Man\" includes both man and woman in ancient and medieval Indian texts. Olivelle translates it as the \"aims of human life\".\n\nPurusartha is also referred to as \"Caturvarga\".\n\n\"Purusartha\" is a key concept in Hinduism, which holds that every human being has four proper goals that are necessary and sufficient for a fulfilling and happy life,\n\nAncient Indian literature emphasizes that dharma is foremost. If dharma is ignored, artha and kama - profit and pleasure respectively - lead to social chaos. The Gautama Dharmashastra, Apastamba Dharmasutra and Yājñavalkya Smṛti, as examples, all suggest that dharma comes first and is more important than artha and kama.\n\nKamasutra states the relative value of three goals as follows: artha is more important and should precede kama, while dharma is more important and should precede both kama and artha. Kautiliya's Arthashastra, however, argues that artha is the foundation for the other two. Without prosperity and security in society or at individual level, both moral life and sensuality become difficult. Poverty breeds vice and hate, while prosperity breeds virtues and love, suggested Kautiliya. Kautilya adds that all three are mutually connected, and one should not cease enjoying life, nor virtuous behavior, nor pursuit of wealth creation. Excessive pursuit of any one aspect of life with complete rejection of other two, harms all three including the one excessively pursued. The sastras, states Kane, observe that the relative precedence of artha, kama and dharma are naturally different with age.\n\nMoksha is considered in Hinduism as the \"parama-puruṣārtha\" or ultimate goal of human life.\n\nIndian scholars recognized and have debated the inherent tension between renunciation and \"Moksha\" on one hand, and the active pursuit of \"Kama\" and \"Artha\" on the other. This has led to the concepts of \"Pravrtti\" (प्रवृत्ति, Pravritti) and \"Nivrtti\" (निवृत्ति, Nivritti), with former meaning \"giving or devoting one's self to\" external action, while the latter means \"withdrawing and restraining one's self from\" external action in order to focus on one's own liberation. \"Artha\" and \"Kama\" are \"Pravrtti\", while \"Moksha\" is \"Nivrtti\". Both are considered important in Hinduism. Manusmriti, for example, describes it as,\n\nIndian scholars offered a creative resolution to the tension between \"action\"-filled life and \"renunciation\"-driven life, by suggesting the best of both worlds can be achieved by dedicating oneself to \"action with renunciation\", that is when \"action is without attachment or craving for results\". Action must be engaged in because it is \"Dharma\", that is, it is good, virtuous, right, a duty and a moral activity, and not because of one's craving for the results or material rewards without any consideration for Dharma. This idea of \"craving-free, dharma-driven action\" has been called \"Nishkam Karma\" in Bhagavad Gita. Other Indian texts state the same answer to tension between \"pursue wealth and love\" versus \"renounce everything\" \"Purusarthas\", but using different words. Isa Upanishad, for example, states \"act and enjoy with renunciation, do not covet\".\n\nThe concept of \"moksha\" developed only in the \"Upanishads\", while the early \"Vedas\" treating the goals of human life commonly refer to \"kāma\", \"artha\" and \"dharma\" as the \"trivarga\" or \"three categories\" of possible human pursuits. The \"Dharmaśāstras\" and the epics \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\" are the first known sources that comprehensively present the notion that integrated living entails the pursuit of four goals or ends. Prasad (2008) states that the division between the \"trivarga\" and \"mokṣa\" is intended to highlight the context between the social (\"trivarga\") and personal (\"mokṣa\") spheres.\n\nThe \"Sannyasa\" is entirely focussed on the pursuit of \"Moksha\" without violating \"Dharma\". Baudhayana Dharmasūtra, completed by about 7th century BC, states the following behavioral vows for a person in \"Sannyasa\",\nBaudhāyana also makes repeated references to the \"Sannyasa\" (ascetic) stage and its behavioral focus, such as in verses II.13.7 and 11.18.13. This reference, Olivelle states, is found in many early to mid 1st millennium BC texts, and is clearly from gnomic poetry about an established ascetic tradition by the time Baudhayana Dharmasutra and other texts were written. Katha Upanishad, in hymns 2.1–2.2 contrasts the human feeling of pleasant (\"preyas\", प्रेयस्) with that of bliss (\"sreyas\", श्रेयस्), praising the latter. The hymns of Rig Veda in Book 10 Chapter 136, mention \"Muni\" (मुनि, monks, mendicants, holy man), with characteristics that mirror those found in later concepts of renunication-practising, \"Moksha\"-motivated ascetics (\"Sannyasins\" and \"Sannyasinis\"). These \"Muni\" are said to be \"Kesins\" (केशिन्, long haired) wearing \"Mala\" clothes (मल, dirty, soil-colored, yellow, orange, saffron) and engaged in the affairs of \"Mananat\" (mind, meditation).\n\nScharfe states, \"there are abundant references both to the \"trivarga\" and \"caturvarga\" in Hindu literature throughout the ages\".\n\nEach of these four canonical \"puruṣārthas\" was subjected to a process of study and extensive literary development in Indian history. This produced numerous treatises, with a diversity of views, in each category. Some purusartha-focused literature include,\n\n\nThe Sanskrit Epics devote major sections on \"purusarthas\", in particular debating dharma. The ancient Tamil literature of the Tirukkural focuses on the first three of the purusarthas (Dharma, Artha, and Kama) without discussing Moksha, suggesting that \"the proper pursuit of the other three will inevitably lead to the fourth.\" The Nalatiyar, another work of the Sangam literature, too, follows similar philosophy as the Tirukkural.\n\nThe four puruṣārthas are often discussed in the context of four ashramas or stages of life (\"Brahmacharya\" – student, \"Grihastha\" – householder, \"Vanaprastha\" – retirement and \"Sannyasa\" – renunciation). Scholars have attempted to connect the four stages to the four puruṣārthas, however Olivelle dismisses this, as neither ancient nor medieval texts of India state that any of the first three ashramas must devote itself predominantly to one specific goal of life. \n\nThe fourth stage of \"Sannyasa\" is different, and the overwhelming consensus in ancient and medieval Indian texts is that anyone accepting \"Sannyasa\" must entirely devote to \"Moksha\" aided by \"Dharma\", with a complete renunciation of \"Artha\" and \"Kama\".\n\nWith the known exception of Kamasutra, most texts make no recommendation on the relative preference on Artha or Kama, that an individual must emphasize in what stage of life. The Kamasutra states,\n\nThis text does not mention the ashramas however.\n\nThe four proper goals of a human being in Indian traditions:\n\nOther elements of ethical theories in Indian traditions:\nOther theories on human needs:\nCited books:\n\n\n"}

It also serves to describe an idealism without regard to practicality. An impulsive person or act might be regarded as quixotic.\n\nQuixotism is usually related to \"over-idealism\", meaning an idealism that doesn't take consequence or absurdity into account. It is also related to naïve romanticism and to utopianism.\n\nQuixotism as a term or a quality appeared after the publication of \"Don Quixote\" in 1605. Don Quixote, the hero of this novel, written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, dreams up a romantic ideal world which he believes to be real, and acts on this idealism, which most famously leads him into imaginary fights with windmills that he regards as giants, leading to the related metaphor of \"tilting at windmills.\"\n\nAlready in the 17th century the term Quixote was used to describe a person who does not distinguish between reality and imagination. The poet John Cleveland wrote in 1644, in his book \"The character of a London diurnall\":\n\nThe word Quixotism is mentioned, for the first time, in \"Pulpit Popery, True Popery\" (1688):\n\n"}

It was founded in 1958 with $500,000 in funding by local businesses and the three North Carolina universities in the Research Triangle region. RTI started with departments for research in isotopes, operational sciences and statistics. It restructured into four departments in 1971 and later created the Office for International Projects, now called the International Development Group. \n\nRTI later split into eleven departments, including Health Research, Drug Discovery & Development, Education & Training Research, Survey Research, among others. The US Agency for International Development has come to account for 35 percent of RTI's research revenue. RTI research has covered HIV/AIDS, healthcare, education curriculum and the environment, among others. Forbes magazine ranked RTI International sixth of 250 in its America’s Best Employers list for mid-size companies for 2016. In 2016, RTI acquired business interests in banking/financial consulting to accompany its profitable RTI-Health Solutions, a unit focused on the pharmaceutical and health technology sectors. \n\nIn 1954, Romeo Guest, a building contractor, met with the North Carolina state treasurer, Brandon Hodges, and the president of Wachovia, Robert Hanes, to discuss building a research park in North Carolina to attract new industries to the region. They obtained support for the concept of Research Triangle Park from state governor Luther Hodges and the three universities that form the research triangle: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University and North Carolina State University. The Research Triangle Institute (now RTI International) was formed as the research park's first tenant in 1958 by the park's founders. The following January they announced that $1.425 million had been raised by the Research Triangle Foundation to fund the park and that $500,000 of it had been set aside for RTI.\n\nRTI started with three divisions: Isotope Development, Operational Sciences and Statistics Research. Its first contract was a $4,500 statistical study of morbidity data from Tennessee. In RTI's first year of operation, it had 25 staff and $240,000 in research contracts. Its early work was focused on statistics, but within a few years expanded into radioisotopes, organic chemistry and polymers. In 1960 the Institute had its first international research contract, for an agricultural census in Nigeria. RTI won contracts with the Department of Education, Defense Department, NASA and the Atomic Energy Commission, growing to $3.4 million in contracts in 1964 and $85 million in 1988. \n\nIn 1971, RTI's staff of 430 was reorganized into four research groups: social and economic systems, statistical sciences, environmental sciences and engineering, and chemistry and life sciences. It also created a division for education called the Center for Education Research and Evaluation. Four years later, RTI created the Office for International Programs to manage international projects. RTI provided funding assistance to help found the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in 1980, and two years later was part of a joint venture to create Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC), a non-profit whose computer network connected local K-12 schools. A Health Solutions division formed in 2000 serves the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries. In 2015, it formed a subsidiary in New Delhi, India. Among other projects, it was funded to develop a waterless toilet for use in third-world countries.\n\nRTI International is a not-for-profit research organization that also includes commercial for-profit industries in business consulting and pharmaceutical sectors. RTI was initially established by three local universities, but managed independently by a separate board and management team. RTI's structure consists of members of the corporation, the board of governors and corporate officers. The members of the corporation elect governors, who in turn create the organization's policies. Corporate officers are senior managers that report to the board for their area of responsibility. \n\nRTI has eleven service areas:\nRTI also has a separate business called RTI Health Solutions, which supports biotech, diagnostic and medical device companies. As of 2012, the organization's largest division managed the social, statistical and environmental sciences services. More than half of RTI's staff have advanced degrees in one of 120 fields and work on approximately 1,200 projects at a time. RTI has partnerships with the Research Triangle Energy Consortium, the Triangle Global Health Consortium and other universities and research organizations. Many of RTI's staff hold faculty positions at the three universities that form the Research Triangle and participate in cooperative research projects. \n\nThere are nine US offices and nine international locations in France, the United Kingdom, South America, India and Indonesia, among others, supporting operations in 80 countries. About 60 percent of RTI's staff are headquartered on a 180-acre campus inside the Research Triangle Park. Most of RTI International's funding comes from government research contracts. In 2012 it authored 627 journal articles. RTI staff are not independent researchers, but are instead compensated for their time as salary in exchange for yielding any scientific interests in external publications and extramural funding. At the time, RTI owned 400 patents. RTI competes with the three universities that form the research triangle and other research institutes for contracts. It bids on $2 billion in research contracts a year and wins approximately 40 percent of the budget it bids on. While RTI is technically a non-profit research institute, senior employees are rewarded salary bonuses (4% for senior staff, and 9-15% for managers) based on annual performance and corporate profit. However, employees have no current vested interest or role in corporate governance. \n\nRTI International's research has spanned areas like cancer, pollution, drug abuse and education.\n\nRTI scientists Monroe Wall and Mansukh C. Wani synthesized anti-cancer treatments camptothecin in 1966, from the bark of the Camptotheca tree, and Taxol in 1971, from a Pacific yew tree. These two drugs account for $3 billion a year in sales by pharmaceutical companies. In 1986, RTI was awarded a $4 million contract with the National Cancer Institute to conduct an eight-year clinical trial on the effects of an anti-smoking campaign. Two years later, RTI began a $4.4 million program to coordinate AIDS drug trials for the National Institutes of Health. This had grown to $26 million by 1988.\n\nRTI scientists helped identify toxic chemicals in the Love Canal in the 1970s. In 1978, RTI researched the possibility of improving solar cells for the US Department of Energy and coal gasification for the Environmental Protection Agency in 1979. It trained Chinese government employees on using computer models to forecast pollution patterns before the 2007 Olympics in Beijing.\n\nAn RTI survey in 1973, commissioned by the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, confirmed prior research that found no connection between drug use and violent crime, despite prior perceptions of heroin users as more prone to violence. A 1975 study RTI conducted for the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that 28 percent of 13,000 teenagers polled were \"problem drinkers,\" despite their age. A 1996 study done by RTI and funded by the Pentagon found that drug abuse in the military had been reduced by 90 percent since 1980.\n\nRTI in 1975 recommended that the Bureau of the Mint halt expensive production of pennies, and replace half-dollars with a new dollar coin. In 2001, RTI scientists created a new thinfilm superlattice material that uses the thermoelectric effect to cool microprocessors. A 2009 study by RTI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published in \"Health Affairs\" estimated that obesity in the US caused $147 billion in increased medical care costs annually. RTI also developed a reading skill measurement program, the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA), for the USAID and the World Bank. The EGRA has been used in 70 languages and 50 countries.\n\nIn the 1980s, RTI created and distributed the Architecture Design and Assessment System, a set of software programs that helped model intricate systems. The ADAS programs were produced until the mid-1990s.\n\nRTI began working for the US Agency for International Development (USAID) after the conflict between Iraq and the US began in 2003. USAID work represented 35 percent of RTI's revenue by 2010. An employee of the contractor Unity Resources Group, hired to protect RTI staff doing USAID work in Iraq, shot and killed two Iraqi women on October 9, 2007. \n\nIn 2004, Nextreme was spun off of RTI to develop a thermoelectric material for semiconductors commercially. RTI acquired a healthcare marketing firm called MasiMax in March 2009. It also created another semiconductor startup that year called SiXis. In 2011 RTI created the Center for Agricultural and Environmental Biotechnology and in 2012 it acquired a California-based education research firm, MPR Associates.\n"}

The rover is planned to be launched in July 2020 and land on Mars in March 2021.\n\nRaman spectroscopy is a very useful technique employed to identify mineral phases produced by water-related processes. RLS will help to identify organic compounds and search for microbial life by identifying the mineral products and indicators of biologic activities. RLS will provide geological and mineralogical context information that will be scientifically cross-correlated with that obtained by other instruments.\n\nRaman spectroscopy is sensitive to the composition and structure of any organic compound, making it a powerful tool for the definitive identification and characterisation of biomarkers, and providing direct information of potential biosignatures of past microbial life on Mars. This instrument will also provide general mineralogical information for igneous, metamorphous, and sedimentary processes.\n\nRST will also correlate its spectral information with other spectroscopic and imaging instruments such as the Infrared Spectrometer and MicrOmega-IR. This will be the first Raman analyser to be deployed for a planetary exploration. The first version for the rover was presented by Fernando Rull-Perez and Sylvestre Maurice in 2003. The RLS is being developed by a European consortium integrated by Spanish, French, German and UK partners. The Principal Investigator is Fernando Rull-Perez, from \"Centro de Astrobiología\" in Spain. The co-investigator is from Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées (LAOMP), France.\n\nThe three major components are the \"Spectrometer Unit\", the \"Control and Excitation Unit\" (includes the power converters), and \"Optical head\".\n\nThe RLS instrument provides a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. It is used to analyse the vibrational modes of a substance either in the solid, liquid or gas state. The technique relies on Raman scattering of a photon by molecules which are excited to higher vibrational or rotational energy levels. In more detail, it will collect and analyse the scattered light emitted by a laser on a crushed Mars rock sample; the spectrum observed (number of peaks, position and relative intensities) is determined by the molecular structure and composition of a compound, enabling the identification and characterisation of the compounds in the sample. \n\nSome advantages of RLS over other analysers are that it is nondestructive, analysis is completed in a fraction of a second, and the spectral bands provide definitive composition of the material. RLS measurements will be conducted on the resulting crushed sample powder and it will be a useful tool for flagging the presence of organic molecules for further biomarker search by the MOMA analyser.\n\nThe processor board carries out several key functions for the Raman spectrometer control, spectral operation, data storage, and communications with the rover. The complete instrument has a mass of 2.4 kg (5.29 lb) and consumes about 30 W while operating.\n\nThe goal of RLS is to seek signs of past life on Mars (biosignatures and biomarkers) by analysing drilled samples acquired from 2  meters below the Martian surface by the ExoMars rover core drill.

For example, for a group of patients first we need to find the observed mortality rates for all the hospitals of interest. Then we can build/construct a model or use an existing model to predict mortality rates for each of the hospitals. It is expected that the number of patients in each hospital will be different and hence we need an overall (weighted) mortality rate for all these hospitals. Once we have the above three rates, then we can utilize the above formula to find the risk adjusted mortality rate which will reflect the actual mortality rate of a particular hospital without being biased from the observed mortality.\n\nIn the English NHS the Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator, the Hospital Standardised Mortality Rate and the Risk Adjusted Mortality Index are all used.

On his initiative, he was the first clergyman to print of a book in an Arab country.\n\nSarkis Rizzi's family presented at this time three patriarchs to the Maronite Church: his two uncles Michel (1567 - 1581) and of the same name Sarkis (1581 - 1596) and his younger brother Joseph (October 3, 1596 - March 26, 1608). Youssef was abbot of the Monastery of Qozhaya in the Kadisha Valley after the election of his uncle Sarkis patriarch and was in 1595 appointed bishop.\n\nThe young Sarkis belonged in 1584 to the first group of students at the Pontificio Collegio dei Maroniti in Rome. Rizzi was in Rome when was ordained deacon and priest, and after that he returned to Lebanon in 1596. In September–October of this year he was at the Second Synod of Qannoubine. The Synod was passed through the papal legate Jerome Dandini. In this Synod, his brother Youssef was elected patriarch. He then took over his post as head of the Monastery of Qozhaya. In 1600 Rizzi was consecrated bishop by his brother (as Metropolitan of Damascus), but remained in the monastery.\n\nIn 1606 he was sent by the patriarch to Rome as head of a delegation to the new Pope Paul V to give him his congratulations. He left Tripoli in October 1606 and reached Rome on 19 April 1607. Patriarch Youssef died on March 26, 1608. Due to difficulties that the Ottoman authorities made, the election of his successor John VIII Machlouf not take place before the beginning of 1609. The new Patriarch actually even had some time after Chouf flee. Rizzi then returned to Lebanon. Sometime between 1609-1610 he arrived there. But the new Patriarch initiated a policy of reaction against the family Rizzi, who had 40 years exercised the power in the Church. The monastery of Qozhaya was also returned to the bishop and Youssef Rizzi excommunicated.\n\nSarkis Rizzi returned then finally to Rome, which he reached sometime before 1621. There he worked on many out lative projects: The issue of the Maronite Breviariums in 1624, the pressure of the Syrian grammar of Abraham Ecchellensis in 1628, and the Thesaurus of the Franciscan Orientalists Tommaso Obizzino (Tommaso da Novaria) in 1636. He also worked on the project of Arabic Bible whose completion should continue until 1671.\n\nHis name is particularly associated with the publication of the Psalter of Qozhaya, an edition of the Psalms in Syriac and Garschuni (Arabic written in the Syriac alphabet). This was the first book printed in Lebanon and the entire region of the Levant. This pressure remained the only one for almost a century.\n\nPreviously, the only printed books that were in circulation in Lebanon were the catechisms in Garschuni and the Arabic version of the Professio fidei Tridentina which were also drafted in Garschuni. The Jesuit Giovanni Battista Eliano had brought them from Rome in 1580. Another book with Maronite prayers had been printed in 1584 in Rome and in the following years created more prints in various Italian cities.\n\nThe Psalter of Quzhaya comprises 268 pages (without numbering eight, then 260 pages numbering in Syrian letters). The headers of the pages bear in red the Syrian tracks Ktobo d-mazmuré (Book of Psalms). There are 150 psalms and a canonical apocryphal, which obviously comes from the Syriac tradition, four biblical canticles and another of Ephrem the Syrian (only in Syriac). The texts are arranged on the sides in two columns, left and right in Syriac Garschuni. Since the Arabic text is longer, the characters have different sizes to obtain the parallelism. On the first page there is the signature of Sarkis (Sergius Risius Archiepiscopus Damascenus) with its coat of arms and the following information: \"The revered hermitage of the Sacred Valley of Qozhaya in Mount Lebanon, work of the master Pasquale Eli and low Youssef ibn Amimeh de Karmsaddé called deacon, in 1610, of the Lord.\" On the third page, the preface to the reader finds, written in Garschuni of Sarkis Rizzi. On page 258 is the imprimatur by the Bishop of Zgharta, Girgis Ibn Amira (probably in revenge no mention of Patriarch John Makhlouf). The last two pages are taken from the colophon, which is written in the first person of Deacon Youssef ibn Amimeh, who explains that he is through his mother the nephew of the initiator Sarkis Rizzi. He wishes to thank all employees of the company. The date of signature is precise: November 10, 1610.\n\nSarkis was a master printer coming from Italy, and Pasquale Eli from Camerino who guided the work. But it is not known whether the Bishop during this year stayed even in Lebanon, or whether he was in Rome, and his nephew alone ran the company. Unknown is also the origin of the print types (two types in different sizes): they were also brought from Italy, or produced locally? They are known from no other issue. The filigree design speaks for the production in Italy.\n\nThe issue has long been little known. Gabriel Sionita asserts (Syrian-Latin, Paris, 1625) in his preface to his bilingual Psalter that he had manufactured the first printed edition of this text in Syriac. The patriarch Estephan El Douaihy (1630-1704) mentioned the work in any of his numerous writings on the community and culture of the Maronites (dans ses nombreux écrits sur la communauté et la culture Maronites, ne jamais la mentionne). However, it is certain that this pressure has taken place in 1610. In the example that in the Nuremberg Municipal Library has been preserved in 1611 two piastres that were acquired by the Bishop of Zgharta by the scholar German Tobias Adami.Leo Allatius invokes in his Apes urbanae, sive de viris illustribus (Rome, 1633) on Sarkis Rizzi and confirms the issue. However, the first bibliography, which mentions the issue is the Bibliotheca Sacra of Jacques Lelong in 1709.\n\nAlso known are a few examples: one each in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (A-495); in the Sainte-Geneviève Library (Fol A58 Inv 62 Res.); at the Nuremberg Library (Ms. Solg 21. 2); in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel (Bible-S 4 ° 227th); in Lebanon in the Bibliothèque orientale the Saint Joseph University (USJ-BO 26C2) and in the Bibliothèque centrale of the Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, Kaslik (USEK Pat. 291).\n\nThere is no information on the whereabouts of the printing materials after production of the book. There was another attempt to set up a printing works in Lebanon (1627) and apparently was also the one that had been set up in Monastery of Qozhaya has already been lost. When the OLM's building was given back in 1708, there were no furnishings more and a printing house was set up again only at the beginning of the 19th century. After the one-time preparation of the printing of psalter in Quzhaya was only at the end of the 18th century into the Levant that was introduced again by the Melkite Patriarch Athanasius IV (1720-1724): he acquired a printing press from Bucharest and established in 1704 a printing house in Aleppo; some issues of biblical and liturgical texts appeared there from 1706 to 1711, before even this activity was canceled again. Only in 1733 was built permanently by a Melkite deacon, Abdallah Zakher, a print shop in the monastery of Dhour El Choueir.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "513815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=513815", "title": "Shroud", "text": "Shroud\n\nShroud usually refers to an item, such as a cloth, that covers or protects some other object. The term is most often used in reference to \"burial sheets\", mound shroud, grave clothes, winding-cloths or winding-sheets, such as the famous Shroud of Turin or \"Tachrichim\" (burial shrouds) that Jews are dressed in for burial. Traditionally, mound shrouds are made of white cotton, wool or linen, though any material can be used so long as it is made of natural fibre. Intermixture of two or more such fibres is forbidden, a proscription that ultimately derives from the Torah, \"viz.\", Deut. 22:11.\n\nA traditional Orthodox Jewish shroud consists of a tunic; a hood; pants that are extra-long and sewn shut at the bottom, so that separate foot coverings are not required; and a belt, which is tied in a knot shaped like the Hebrew letter \"shin\", mnemonic of one of God's names, Shaddai. Early shrouds incorporated a cloth, the \"sudarium\", that covered the face, as depicted in traditional artistic representations of the entombed Jesus or His friend, Lazarus (John 11, \"q.v.\"). An especially pious man may next be enwrapped in either his kittel or his tallit, one tassel of which is defaced to render the garment ritually unfit, symbolizing the fact that the decedent is free from the stringent requirements of the 613 \"mitzvot\" (commandments). The shrouded body is wrapped in a winding sheet, termed a \"sovev\" in Hebrew (a cognate of \"svivon\", the spinning Hanukkah toy that is familiar under its Yiddish name, \"dreidel\"), before being placed either in a plain coffin of soft wood (where required by governing health codes) or directly in the earth. Croesus-rich or dirt-poor, every Orthodox Jew is dressed to face the Almighty on the same terms.\n\nThe Early Christian Church also strongly encouraged the use of winding-sheets, except for monarchs and bishops. The rich were wrapped in cerecloths, which are fine fabrics soaked or painted in wax to hold the fabric close to the flesh. An account of the opening of the coffin of Edward I says that the \"innermost covering seems to have been a very fine linen cerecloth, dressed close to every part of the body\". Their use was general until at least the Renaissance – clothes were very expensive, and they had the advantage that a good set of clothes was not lost to the family.\nIn Europe in the Middle Ages, coarse linen shrouds were used to bury most poor without a coffin. In poetry shrouds have been described as of sable, and they were later embroidered in black, becoming more elaborate and cut like shirts or shifts.\n\nMuslims as well use burial shrouds that are made of white cotton or linen. The Burying in Woollen Acts 1666-80 in England were meant to support the production of woollen cloth.\n\n"}

HS is a phytotoxin that results from anaerobic digestion, the decomposition of organic matter in the absence of oxygen. However, seagrass can persist in this environment because of physiological adaptations, as well as functional adaptations of other organisms in the ecosystem. For example, bivalves (clams) in the family Lucinidae host symbiotic bacteria that oxidize sulfides. Lucinid bivalves' gills house the bacteria, and the siphon supplies the bacteria and surrounding pore water with oxygenated water from above the sediment. Bacterial oxidation of the sulfides results in sulfates, reducing toxicity.\n\n"}
{"id": "26859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26859", "title": "Synergy", "text": "Synergy\n\nSynergy is the creation of a whole that is greater than the simple sum of its parts. The term \"synergy\" comes from the Attic Greek word συνεργία ' from ', , meaning \"working together\".\n\nThe words \"synergy\" and \"synergetic\" have been used in the field of physiology since at least the middle of the 19th century:\n\nSYN'ERGY, \"Synergi'a\", \"Synenergi'a\", (F.) \"Synergie\"; from \"συν\", 'with,' and \"εργον\", 'work.' A correlation or concourse of action between different organs in health; and, according to some, in disease.\n\nIn 1896, applied the term \"synergy\" to social psychology by writing \"La synergie sociale\", in which he argued that Darwinian theory failed to account for \"social synergy\" or \"social love\", a collective evolutionary drive. The highest civilizations were the work not only of the elite but of the masses too; those masses must be led, however, because the crowd, a feminine and unconscious force, cannot distinguish between good and evil.\n\nIn 1909, Lester Frank Ward defined synergy as the universal constructive principle of nature:\n\nI have characterized the social struggle as centrifugal and social solidarity as centripetal. Either alone is productive of evil consequences. Struggle is essentially destructive of the social order, while communism removes individual initiative. The one leads to disorder, the other to degeneracy. What is not seen—the truth that has no expounders—is that the wholesome, constructive movement consists in the properly ordered combination and interaction of both these principles. This is \"social synergy\", which is a form of cosmic synergy, the universal constructive principle of nature.\nIn the natural world, synergistic phenomena are ubiquitous, ranging from physics (for example, the different combinations of quarks that produce protons and neutrons) to chemistry (a popular example is water, a compound of hydrogen and oxygen), to the cooperative interactions among the genes in genomes, the division of labor in bacterial colonies, the synergies of scale in multi-cellular organisms, as well as the many different kinds of synergies produced by socially-organized groups, from honeybee colonies to wolf packs and human societies: compare stigmergy, a mechanism of indirect coordination between agents or actions that results in the self-assembly of complex systems. Even the tools and technologies that are widespread in the natural world represent important sources of synergistic effects. The tools that enabled early hominins to become systematic big-game hunters is a primordial human example.\nIn the context of organizational behavior, following the view that a cohesive group is more than the sum of its parts, synergy is the ability of a group to outperform even its best individual member. These conclusions are derived from the studies conducted by Jay Hall on a number of laboratory-based group ranking and prediction tasks. He found that effective groups actively looked for the points in which they disagreed and in consequence encouraged conflicts amongst the participants in the early stages of the discussion. In contrast, the ineffective groups felt a need to establish a common view quickly, used simple decision making methods such as averaging, and focused on completing the task rather than on finding solutions they could agree on.\nIn a technical context, its meaning is a construct or collection of different elements working together to produce results not obtainable by any of the elements alone. The elements, or parts, can include people, hardware, software, facilities, policies, documents: all things required to produce system-level results. The value added by the system as a whole, beyond that contributed independently by the parts, is created primarily by the relationship among the parts, that is, how they are interconnected. In essence, a system constitutes a set of interrelated components working together with a common objective: fulfilling some designated need.\n\nIf used in a business application, synergy means that teamwork will produce an overall better result than if each person within the group were working toward the same goal individually. However, the concept of group cohesion needs to be considered. Group cohesion is that property that is inferred from the number and strength of mutual positive attitudes among members of the group. As the group becomes more cohesive, its functioning is affected in a number of ways. First, the interactions and communication between members increase. Common goals, interests and small size all contribute to this. In addition, group member satisfaction increases as the group provides friendship and support against outside threats.\n\nThere are negative aspects of group cohesion that have an effect on group decision-making and hence on group effectiveness. There are two issues arising. The risky shift phenomenon is the tendency of a group to make decisions that are riskier than those that the group would have recommended individually. Group Polarisation is when individuals in a group begin by taking a moderate stance on an issue regarding a common value and, after having discussed it, end up taking a more extreme stance.\n\nA second, potential negative consequence of group cohesion is group think. Group think is a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in cohesive group, when the members' striving for unanimity overrides their motivation to appraise realistically the alternative courses of action. Studying the events of several American policy \"disasters\" such as the failure to anticipate the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (1941) and the Bay of Pigs Invasion fiasco (1961), Irving Janis argued that they were due to the cohesive nature of the committees that made the relevant decisions.\n\nThat decisions made by committees lead to failure in a simple system is noted by Dr. Chris Elliot. His case study looked at IEEE-488, an international standard set by the leading US standards body; it led to a failure of small automation systems using the IEEE-488 standard (which codified a proprietary communications standard HP-IB). But the external devices used for communication were made by two different companies, and the incompatibility between the external devices led to a financial loss for the company. He argues that systems will be safe only if they are designed, not if they emerge by chance.\nThe idea of a systemic approach is endorsed by the United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive. The successful performance of the health and safety management depends upon the analyzing the causes of incidents and accidents and learning correct lessons from them. The idea is that all events (not just those causing injuries) represent failures in control, and present an opportunity for learning and improvement. UK Health and Safety Executive, \"Successful health and safety management\" (1997): this book describes the principles and management practices, which provide the basis of effective health and safety management. It sets out the issues that need to be addressed, and can be used for developing improvement programs, self-audit, or self-assessment. Its message is that organizations must manage health and safety with the same degree of expertise and to the same standards as other core business activities, if they are to effectively control risks and prevent harm to people.\n\nThe term synergy was refined by R. Buckminster Fuller, who analyzed some of its implications more fully and coined the term synergetics.\n\n\nSynergy of various kinds has been advanced by Peter Corning as a causal agency that can explain the progressive evolution of complexity in living systems over the course of time. According to the Synergism Hypothesis, synergistic effects have been the drivers of cooperative relationships of all kinds and at all levels in living systems. The thesis, in a nutshell, is that synergistic effects have often provided functional advantages (economic benefits) in relation to survival and reproduction that have been favored by natural selection. The cooperating parts, elements, or individuals become, in effect, functional “units” of selection in evolutionary change. Similarly, environmental systems may react in a non-linear way to perturbations, such as climate change, so that the outcome may be greater than the sum of the individual component alterations. Synergistic responses are a complicating factor in environmental modeling.\n\nPest synergy would occur in a biological host organism population, where, for example, the introduction of parasite A may cause 10% fatalities, and parasite B may also cause 10% loss. When both parasites are present, the losses would normally be expected to total less than 20%, yet, in some cases, losses are significantly greater. In such cases, it is said that the parasites in combination have a synergistic effect.\n\nMechanisms that may be involved in the development of synergistic effects include:\n\nMore mechanisms are described in an exhaustive 2009 review.\n\nToxicological synergy is of concern to the public and regulatory agencies because chemicals individually considered safe might pose unacceptable health or ecological risk in combination. Articles in scientific and lay journals include many definitions of chemical or toxicological synergy, often vague or in conflict with each other. Because toxic interactions are defined relative to the expectation under \"no interaction\", a determination of synergy (or antagonism) depends on what is meant by \"no interaction\". The United States Environmental Protection Agency has one of the more detailed and precise definitions of toxic interaction, designed to facilitate risk assessment. In their guidance documents, the no-interaction default assumption is dose addition, so synergy means a mixture response that exceeds that predicted from dose addition. The EPA emphasizes that synergy does not always make a mixture dangerous, nor does antagonism always make the mixture safe; each depends on the predicted risk under dose addition.\n\nFor example, a consequence of pesticide use is the risk of health effects. During the registration of pesticides in the United States exhaustive tests are performed to discern health effects on humans at various exposure levels. A regulatory upper limit of presence in foods is then placed on this pesticide. As long as residues in the food stay below this regulatory level, health effects are deemed highly unlikely and the food is considered safe to consume.\n\nHowever, in normal agricultural practice, it is rare to use only a single pesticide. During the production of a crop, several different materials may be used. Each of them has had determined a regulatory level at which they would be considered individually safe. In many cases, a commercial pesticide is itself a combination of several chemical agents, and thus the safe levels actually represent levels of the mixture. In contrast, a combination created by the end user, such as a farmer, has rarely been tested in that combination. The potential for synergy is then unknown or estimated from data on similar combinations. This lack of information also applies to many of the chemical combinations to which humans are exposed, including residues in food, indoor air contaminants, and occupational exposures to chemicals. Some groups think that the rising rates of cancer, asthma, and other health problems may be caused by these combination exposures; others have alternative explanations. This question will likely be answered only after years of exposure by the population in general and research on chemical toxicity, usually performed on animals. Examples of pesticide synergists include Piperonyl butoxide and MGK 264.\n\nHuman synergy relates to human interaction and teamwork. For example, say person A alone is too short to reach an apple on a tree and person B is too short as well. Once person B sits on the shoulders of person A, they are tall enough to reach the apple. In this example, the product of their synergy would be one apple. Another case would be two politicians. If each is able to gather one million votes on their own, but together they were able to appeal to 2.5 million voters, their synergy would have produced 500,000 more votes than had they each worked independently. A song is also a good example of human synergy, taking more than one musical part and putting them together to create a song that has a much more dramatic effect than each of the parts when played individually.\n\nA third form of human synergy is when one person is able to complete two separate tasks by doing one action, for example, if a person were asked by a teacher and his boss at work to write an essay on how he could improve his work. A more visual example of this synergy is a drummer using four separate rhythms to create one drum beat.\n\nSynergy usually arises when two persons with different complementary skills cooperate. In business, cooperation of people with organizational and technical skills happens very often. In general, the most common reason why people cooperate is that it brings a synergy. On the other hand, people tend to specialize just to be able to form groups with high synergy (see also division of labor and teamwork).\n\nExample: Two teams in System Administration working together to combine technical and organizational skills in order to better the client experience, thus creating synergy. Counter-examples can be found in books like The Mythical Man-Month, in which the addition of additional team members is shown to have negative effects on productivity.\n\nOrganismic computing is an approach to improving group efficacy by increasing synergy in human groups via technological means.\n\nWhen synergy occurs in the work place, the individuals involved get to work in a positive and supportive working environment. When individuals get to work in environments such as these, the company reaps the benefits. The authors of \"Creating the Best Workplace on Earth\" Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones, state that \"highly engaged employees are, on average, 50% more likely to exceed expectations that the least-engaged workers. And companies with highly engaged people outperform firms with the most disengaged folks- by 54% in employee retention, by 89% in customer satisfaction, and by fourfold in revenue growth (Goffee & Jones, pg. 100).\" Also, those that are able to be open about their views on the company, and have confidence that they will be heard, are likely to be a more organized employee who helps his/ her fellow team members succeed.\n\nCorporate synergy occurs when corporations interact congruently. A corporate synergy refers to a financial benefit that a corporation\nexpects to realize when it merges with or acquires another corporation. This type of synergy is a nearly ubiquitous feature of a corporate acquisition and is a negotiating point between the buyer and seller that impacts the final price both parties agree to. There are distinct types of corporate synergies, as follows.\n\nA marketing synergy refers to the use of information campaigns, studies, and scientific discovery or experimentation for research or development. This promotes the sale of products for varied use or off-market sales as well as development of marketing tools and in several cases exaggeration of effects. It is also often a meaningless buzzword used by corporate leaders.\n\nA revenue synergy refers to the opportunity of a combined corporate entity to generate more revenue than its two predecessor stand-alone companies would be able to generate. For example, if company A sells product X through its sales force, company B sells product Y, and company A decides to buy company B then the new company could use each sales person to sell products X and Y, thereby increasing the revenue that each sales person generates for the company.\n\nIn media revenue, synergy is the promotion and sale of a product throughout the various subsidiaries of a media conglomerate, e.g. films, soundtracks, or video games.\n\nFinancial synergy gained by the combined firm is a result of number of benefits which flow to the entity as a consequence of acquisition and merger. These benefits may be:\n\nThis is when a firm having number of cash extensive projects acquires a firm which is cash-rich, thus enabling the new combined firm to enjoy the profits from investing the cash of one firm in the projects of the other.\n\nIf two firms have no or little capacity to carry debt before individually, it is possible for them to join and gain the capacity to carry the debt through decreased gearing (leverage). This creates value for the firm, as debt is thought to be a cheaper source of finance.\n\nIt is possible for one firm to have unused tax benefits which might be offset against the profits of another after combination, thus resulting in less tax being paid. However this greatly depends on the tax law of the country.\n\nSynergy in management and in relation to teamwork refers to the combined effort of individuals as participants of the team. The condition that exists when the organization's parts interact to produce a joint effect that is greater than the sum of the parts acting alone. Positive or negative synergies can exist. In these cases, positive synergy has positive effects such as improved efficiency in operations, greater exploitation of opportunities, and improved utilization of resources. Negative synergy on the other hand has negative effects such as: reduced efficiency of operations, decrease in quality, underutilization of resources and disequilibrium with the external environment.\n\nA cost synergy refers to the opportunity of a combined corporate entity to reduce or eliminate expenses associated with running a business. Cost synergies are realized by eliminating positions that are viewed as duplicate within the merged entity. Examples include the headquarters office of one of the predecessor companies, certain executives, the human resources department, or other employees of the predecessor companies. This is related to the economic concept of economies of scale.\n\nThe synergistic action of the economic players lies within the economic phenomenon's profundity. The synergistic action gives different dimensions to competitiveness, strategy and network identity becoming an unconventional \"weapon\" which belongs to those who exploit the economic systems’ potential in depth.\n\nThe synergistic gravity equation (SYNGEq), according to its complex “title”, represents a synthesis of the endogenous and exogenous factors which determine the private and non-private economic decision makers to call to actions of synergistic exploitation of the economic network in which they operate. That is to say, SYNGEq constitutes a big picture of the factors/motivations which determine the entrepreneurs to contour an active synergistic network. SYNGEq includes both factors which character is changing over time (such as the competitive conditions), as well as classics factors, such as the imperative of the access to resources of the collaboration and the quick answers. The synergistic gravity equation (SINGEq) comes to be represented by the formula:\n\n∑SYN.Act = ∑R-*I(CRed+COOP++A)*V(Cust.+Info.)*cc\n\nwhere:\n\nThe synergistic network represents an integrated part of the economic system which, through the coordination and control functions (of the undertaken economic actions), agrees synergies. The networks which promote synergistic actions can be divided in horizontal synergistic networks and vertical synergistic networks.\n\nThe synergy effects are difficult (even impossible) to imitate by competitors and difficult to reproduce by their authors because these effects depend on the combination of factors with time-varying characteristics. The synergy effects are often called \"synergistic benefits\", representing the direct and implied result of the developed/adopted synergistic actions.\n\nSynergy can also be defined as the combination of human strengths and computer strengths, such as advanced chess. Computers can process data much more quickly than humans, but lack the ability to respond meaningfully to arbitrary stimuli.\n\nEtymologically, the \"synergy\" term was first used around 1600, deriving from the Greek word “synergos”, which means “to work together” or “to cooperate”. If during this period the synergy concept was mainly used in the theological field (describing “the cooperation of human effort with divine will”), in the 19th and 20th centuries, \"synergy\" was promoted in physics and biochemistry, being implemented in the study of the open economic systems only in the 1960 and 1970s.\n\nIn 1938, J. R. R. Tolkien wrote an essay titled \"On Fairy Stores\", delivered at an Andrew Lang Lecture, and reprinted in his book, \"The Tolkien Reader\", published in 1966. In it, he made two references to synergy, although he did not use that term. He wrote:\nFaerie cannot be caught in a net of words; for it is one of its qualities to be indescribable, though not imperceptible. It has many ingredients, but analysis will not necessarily discover the secret of the whole.\nAnd more succinctly, in a footnote, about the \"part of producing the web of an intricate story\", he wrote:\nIt is indeed easier to unravel a single \"thread\" — an incident, a name, a motive — than to trace the history of any \"picture\" defined by many threads. For with the picture in the tapestry a new element has come in: the picture is greater than, and not explained by, the sum of the component threads.\n\nThe informational synergies which can be applied also in media involve a compression of transmission, access and use of information’s time, the flows, circuits and means of handling information being based on a complementary, integrated, transparent and coordinated use of knowledge.\n\nIn media economics, synergy is the promotion and sale of a product (and all its versions) throughout the various subsidiaries of a media conglomerate, e.g. films, soundtracks or video games. Walt Disney pioneered synergistic marketing techniques in the 1930s by granting dozens of firms the right to use his Mickey Mouse character in products and ads, and continued to market Disney media through licensing arrangements. These products can help advertise the film itself and thus help to increase the film's sales. For example, the Spider-Man films had toys of webshooters and figures of the characters made, as well as posters and games. The NBC sitcom 30 Rock often shows the power of synergy, while also poking fun at the use of the term in the corporate world. There are also different forms of synergy in popular card games like Yu-Gi-Oh!, Cardfight!! Vanguard, and Future Card Buddyfight.\n\nWhen multiple sources of information taken together provide more information than the sum of the information provided by each source alone, there is said to be a synergy in the sources. This in contrast to the case in which the sources provide less information, in which case there is said to be a redundancy in the sources.\n\n"}

In 1973, Castaneda purchased a compound on Pandora Avenue in Westwood, Los Angeles, and soon after Abelar (she was still known as Maryann Simko at this time), along with Regine Thal and Kathleen Pohlman, who would come to be known collectively as \"the witches\", moved in.

A \"Washington Post\" columnist called him \"the most famous squirrel ever to come from Washington.\"\n\nWhile origin stories vary, Tommy was adopted in 1942 by Zaidee Bullis and her husband Mark C. Bullis, who may have named him after the 18th-century nursery-rhyme character Little Tommy Tucker. Zaidee dressed Tommy in women's clothing to avoid the tailoring around his bushy tail that a male wardrobe would entail.\nFollowing World WarII Tommy \"married\" a squirrel named Buzzy.\n\nIn 1943 the Bullis family began taking Tommy on tour in their Packard automobile,\naccompanied by a bulldog said to have one or more gold teeth and often wearing a fez.\nAudiences were charmed by Tommy's lovingly craftedoften patrioticattire and unusually docile demeanor (though he did sometimes bite). In an early show he performed for 500 elementary school students,\nand in conjunction with war bond sales Tommy gave a purported radio interview alongside President Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nIn 1944 Tommy was featured in \"Life\" magazine, complete with a gallery of photos by Nina Leen. The article noted that \"Mrs. Bullis' main interest in Tommy... is in dressing him up in 30 specially made costumes. Tommy has a coat and hat for going to market, a silk pleated dress for company, a Red Cross uniform for visiting the hospital.\"\n\nIn 1945, at the height of his fame, the Tommy Tucker Club had some 30,000 members.\n\nAfter the war, Tommy largely disappeared from headlines until 1948, when the Bullises were denied entry to California for several days when agricultural officials refused to recognize Tommy as a pet rather than a wild animal.

{"id": "445835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=445835", "title": "USS Gudgeon (SS-211)", "text": "USS Gudgeon (SS-211)\n\nUSS \"Gudgeon\" (SS-211), a \"Tambor\"-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the gudgeon. \n\nHer keel was laid down by the Mare Island Navy Yard. She was launched on 25 January 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Annie B. Pye, wife of Vice Admiral William S. Pye, Commander Battleships, Battle Force and Commander Battle Force. The boat was commissioned on 21 April 1941 with Lieutenant Commander Elton W. \"Joe\" Grenfell in command. Her construction cost $6 million.\n\nAfter shakedown along the California coast, \"Gudgeon\" sailed north on 28 August, heading for Alaska via Seattle, Washington. On her northern jaunt the new submarine inspected Sitka, Kodiak, and Dutch Harbor for suitability as naval bases. Continuing to Hawaii, she moored at the Pearl Harbor submarine base on 10 October 1941. Training exercises and local operations filled \"Gudgeon\"’s time for the next two months.\nDuring the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December she was at Lahaina Roads on special exercises, but returned to base immediately.\n\nOn 11 December, \"Gudgeon\" (commanded by Elton W. \"Joe\" Grenfell) departed Pearl Harbor on the first American submarine war patrol of World War II. Her commanding officer was provided with explicit written orders to carry out unrestricted submarine warfare. \"Gudgeon\" made her first contact on a target in Japanese Home Waters 31 December. When she returned 50 days later, \"Gudgeon\" had contributed two more impressive \"firsts\" to the Pacific submarine fleet. She was the first American submarine to patrol along the Japanese coast itself, as her area took her off Kyūshū in the home islands. On 27 January 1942, \"en route\" home, \"Gudgeon\" became the first United States Navy submarine to sink an enemy warship in World War II. \"Gudgeon\" fired three torpedoes, and \"I-73\" was destroyed; though \"Gudgeon\" claimed only damage, the loss was confirmed by HYPO.\n\nOn her second war patrol, 22 February to 15 April 1942, \"Gudgeon\" scored two kills, first an unknown freighter on 26 March (not identified or confirmed by JANAC), then sinking the 6526-ton \"Nissho Maru\" on 27 March in the East China Sea southeast of Kumun Island.\n\nShe then checked into dry-dock for overhaul, but undocked three weeks early and readied for sea in a remarkable 40 hours to participate in the momentous Battle of Midway.\n\nDeparting Pearl Harbor on 18 May, \"Gudgeon\" took station off Midway Atoll as part of the submarine screen which encircled the two giant fleets clashing there. \"Gudgeon\" was prevented from offensive action by the confusion of battle, the possibility of mistaken identity, and poor staff work by Admiral Robert English, . She returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 June.\n\nDeparting for her fourth patrol 11 July, \"Gudgeon\" sank the 4853-ton transport \"Naniwa Maru\" in a night submerged attack off Truk on 3 August, her only kill of the patrol. In her other attack of the fourth patrol USS Gudgeon carried out an aggressive attack on a four-ship convoy 17 August, torpedoing and damaging the Japanese tankers \"Shinkoku Maru\" (10020 BRT) and \"Nichiei Maru\" (10020 BRT) northwest of Truk before the patrol ended at Fremantle, Australia, on 2 September.\n\nNow a part of the Southwestern Pacific submarine forces, \"Gudgeon\" sank the 6783-ton \"Choko Maru\" west-northwest of Rabaul on 21 October during her fifth war patrol, 8 October to 1 December, and carried out a daring attack on a seven ship convoy on 11 November, torpedoing several ships but sinking none.\n\nThe submarine's sixth war patrol, from 27 December 1942 to 18 February 1943, was unsuccessful in terms of ships sunk, but she carried out two special missions. On 14 January 1943 \"Gudgeon\" successfully landed six men on Catmon Point, Negros Island, Western Visayas, Philippines, to carry out the vital guerrilla resistance movement there. Returning from her patrol area, \"Gudgeon\" was diverted to Timor Island on 9 February, and the following day rescued 28 men—Australian, English, Portuguese, and Filipino—for passage to Fremantle.\n\n\"Gudgeon\"s seventh war patrol, from 13 March into April 1943, netted her two more Japanese ships before she ran out of torpedoes and had to return to Australia. On 22 March she sank the 5434-ton transport \"Meigen Maru\" as well as seriously damaging two other ships in the Java Sea convoy some 30 miles north of Surabaya, Java, Netherlands East Indies. Five days later \"Gudgeon\" took on 9987-ton tanker \"Tōhō Maru\" in a night surface attack in the Makassar Strait punctuated by bursts of gunfire as the Japanese ships spotted and fired on the submarine. It took five torpedoes to sink \"Tōhō Maru\", and most of \"Gudgeon\"'s crew enjoyed the rare treat of watching her slide into the depths. Another attack later the same day damaged the 1192-ton tanker \"Kyoei Maru\".\n\nOn her eighth war patrol, conducted as she sailed from Australia to Pearl Harbor on 15 April to 25 May 1943, \"Gudgeon\" chalked up three more kills. Her first came 28 April as she sank \"Kamakura Maru\", a former ocean liner, southwest of Pucio Point, Panay (now Poblacion, Libertad, Antique), Philippines. The 17,526-ton transport was the largest Japanese transport, and one of the largest enemy ships sunk by an American submarine. Special operations interrupted \"Gudgeon\"'s patrol as she landed six trained guerrilla fighters and three tons of equipment for the guerrilla movement on Panay on 30 April.\n\nAfter sinking the 500-ton trawler \"Naku Maru\" with her deck guns west of Panay 4 May, \"Gudgeon\" battle-surfaced again that same day and left a coastal steamer burning and settling. Eight days later, on 12 May, she torpedoed and sank the 5861-ton freighter \"Sumatra Maru\" off Bulusan, Luzon, Philippines. Returning to Pearl Harbor, the veteran submarine was sent to San Francisco, California, for badly needed overhaul, her first since commissioning two years earlier.\n\nA refreshed sub and crew departed Pearl Harbor for their ninth war patrol 1 September 1943 in the Mariana Islands area. Before returning to Midway Island on 6 October with all torpedoes expended, \"Gudgeon\" had sunk the 3158-ton \"Taian Maru\", torpedoed and damaged the 3266-ton auxiliary gunboat \"Santo Maru\" north of Saipan, as well as seriously damaging several other ships.\n\nHeading along the China coast for her tenth war patrol, form 31 October to 11 December, \"Gudgeon\" chalked up two more marus. Early in the morning of 23 November she spotted a convoy of four ships in the East China Sea some 70 miles north of Shusan Island and closed for attack. \"Gudgeon\" fired a spread of six torpedoes with gratifying results. The 870-ton frigate \"Wakamiya\", hit by one torpedo, broke in two, sinking almost immediately. The two tankers in the convoy, the 5106-ton \"Ichiyo Maru\" and the 8469-ton \"Goyo Maru\", were also hit but managed to escape. \"Gudgeon\" closed in to finish off the 6783-ton troop transport \"Nekka Maru\".\n\n\"Gudgeon\"'s 11th war patrol saw a few successful sinkings of Japanese vessels, the first on 11 February. Before this sinking the submarine had a spell of bad luck where, on 2 February 1944, she had sighted a damaged aircraft carrier with two escorts. \"Gudgeon\" had closed for attack, but the escorts spotted her and attacked. A down-the-throat shot with four torpedoes temporarily discouraged the destroyers and allowed \"Gudgeon\" to seek deep water and safety, but when she surfaced the Japanese men-of-war were gone. Later in the same patrol \"Gudgeon\" was forced to try another down-the-throat shot at an enemy escort, but no hits. Success came only on 11 February. This date saw her torpedoing and sinking the already damaged (by Chinese air attack) 3091-ton merchant \"Satsuma Maru\" off Wenchow, China. On 17 February \"Gudgeon\" sank a Japanese sampan with gunfire in the East China Sea, another sampan being damaged in the attack. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 March 1944.\n\n\"Gudgeon\" sailed for her 12th war patrol on 4 April 1944. The submarine stopped off for fuel at Johnston Island on 7 April, and was never seen or heard from again. On 7 June 1944, \"Gudgeon\" was officially declared overdue and presumed lost. Uboat.net claims \"Gudgeon\" was sunk 18 April 1944 at a known location by the Japanese southeast of Iwo Jima. Some sources say the submarine was more likely to have sunk by attack near the Maug Islands.\n\nFor more detailed and original information about \"Gudgeon\"s likely sinking on 18 April 1944, see \"Find 'Em Chase 'Em Sink 'Em: The Mysterious Loss of the WW II Submarine USS Gudgeon\" and other \"Ostlund\" references below.\n\nDuring her three-year career, \"Gudgeon\" scored 14 confirmed kills of a total of well over 71,372 tons sunk, placing her 15th on the honor roll of American submarines.\n\nFor her first seven war patrols \"Gudgeon\" received the Presidential Unit Citation. She earned 11 battle stars for World War II service.\n\n"}

Other security guards returned fire, wounding von Brunn, who was apprehended.\n\nVon Brunn was charged in federal court on June 11, 2009, with first-degree murder and firearms violations. On July 29, 2009, von Brunn was indicted by a federal grand jury on seven counts, including four which made him eligible for the death penalty; the charges included hate crime counts. In September 2009, a judge ordered von Brunn to undergo a competency evaluation to determine whether or not he could stand trial. On January 6, 2010, von Brunn died of natural causes while awaiting trial.\n\nVon Brunn was a white supremacist and Holocaust denier. He had previously been convicted of entering a federal building with various weapons in 1981 while trying to place the members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, who he considered to be treasonous, under citizen's arrest.\n\nThe Holocaust Museum has been a target for antisemites and Holocaust deniers since it was established in 1993. In 2002, federal prosecutors said two white supremacists plotted to blow up the museum with a fertilizer bomb, as was used to blow up a federal building in Oklahoma in 1995.\n\nAt about 12:49 p.m., 88-year-old James von Brunn drove his car to the 14th Street entrance of the museum. Von Brunn entered the museum when Museum Special Police Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns opened the door for him. Authorities said he raised a .22-caliber rifle and shot Special Police Officer Johns, who later died of his injuries at the George Washington University Hospital. Two other Special Police Officers stationed with Officer Johns, Harry Weeks and Jason \"Mac\" McCuiston, returned fire, wounding von Brunn with a shot to the face. According to police officers at the scene, a third person was injured by broken glass but refused treatment at the hospital.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" reported that \"if it weren't for the quick response of the private guards on duty, more people could have been killed or wounded.\" Mayor Adrian Fenty stated that the officers' efforts \"to bring this gunman down so quickly ... saved the lives of countless people... This could have been much, much worse.\" Inside, the museum was crowded with visiting schoolchildren. Museum officials said that \"the entire incident unfolded in approximately two minutes.\"\n\nAfter the shooting, the nearby U.S. Department of Agriculture Administration Building, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and the USDA's Sidney R. Yates Federal Building were closed. Portions of 14th Street and Independence Avenue in the Southwest quadrant were closed until later in the night. The car driven by von Brunn was found double parked in front of the museum and tested for explosives.\n\nPolice said they found a notebook on von Brunn that contained a list of District locations, including the Washington National Cathedral; they dispatched bomb squads to at least 10 sites. The notebook also contained this passage, signed by von Brunn: \"You want my weapons—this is how you'll get them. The Holocaust is a lie. Obama was created by Jews. Obama does what his Jew owners tell him to do. Jews captured America's money. Jews control the mass media. The 1st Amendment is abrogated henceforth.\"\n\nThe FBI and Washington, D.C. police chief Cathy L. Lanier said that it appeared von Brunn was acting alone at the time of the shooting, and the FBI said it had no knowledge of any threat against the museum. The museum's director of security said they receive threats, but \"nothing this significant recently\".\n\nSeveral news agencies have noted the timing of the June 10 shooting; it came shortly after Obama's June 5 visit to and speech at the Buchenwald concentration camp, and that \"President Obama’s recent visit to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp, in Germany, may have set off the shooter.\"\n\nOn his website, von Brunn stated that his conviction in the 1980s was by \"a Negro jury, Jew/Negro attorneys\" and that he was \"sentenced to prison for eleven years by a Jew judge.\" A Court of Appeals denied his appeal.\n\nSpecial Police Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns (October 4, 1969 – June 10, 2009), a Temple Hills, Maryland native, was an employee of Wackenhut who was, at the time of the shooting, stationed at the door of the museum when von Brunn entered with a .22 caliber long rifle and shot him. He later died at the George Washington University Hospital. His funeral was held on June 19, 2009 at Ebenezer AME Church in Fort Washington, Maryland, with 2,000 attendees, and he was subsequently interred. Johns was married to Zakiah Johns (since May 2008) with a son, Stephen Johns, Jr., and two stepsons, Jeffrey Pollard and Tysean Lawson-Bey. The American Jewish Committee established a memorial fund for the family.\n\nJames W. von Brunn died in prison while awaiting trial on January 6, 2010. He was in poor health and suffered from congestive heart failure and sepsis.\n\nFollowing his death, the \"Washington Post\" notes: \"His guilt was never in serious doubt -- the shooting was witnessed by dozens of people, it was captured on surveillance video and the assailant was carted away in an ambulance -- but some had hoped to glean some insights into von Brunn's psyche during the court process. Many, including Johns's relatives, remain shocked that anyone could be filled with so much hatred that he would shoot a helpful security guard at a museum that serves as a memorial to the slaughter of millions of people.\"\n\nPresent at the museum during the shooting was former United States Secretary of Defense William Cohen, awaiting his wife Janet Langhart; the two were at the museum for the premiere of Langhart's one-act play, \"Anne and Emmett\". The play imagines a conversation between two teenagers, Nazi victim Anne Frank and Jim Crow victim Emmett Till. Her play was to be presented in honor of the eightieth anniversary of Anne Frank's birth.\n\nThe Israeli embassy in Washington condemned the attack. U.S. President Barack Obama said, \"This outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-Semitism and prejudice in all its forms.\"\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, Anti-Defamation League, and FBI stated they had been monitoring von Brunn's Internet postings, but were unable to take action because his comments had not crossed the line from free speech into illegal threats or incitement.\n\nOn June 11, 2009, the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington and the InterFaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington led a prayer vigil which took place in front of the museum to honor Stephen Johns, the slain officer. Approximately 100 people attended the event, including officials from the Israeli and German embassies. The Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the attack as well. When the museum reopened on June 12, 2009, Director Sara Bloomfield said attendance was normal or even higher than usual. Many visitors said their attendance was a statement against hate and intolerance. A 17-year-old girl who was in the museum the day of the shooting stated, \"It's important to come back, because if you don't, they win. It's a form of terrorism.\"\n\nOn the white nationalist Internet forum Stormfront, some users criticized von Brunn's actions, saying they hurt the forum's cause. Others supported him in threads that were later removed.\n\n"}

Although his paintings have not survived, historical records state they were known for their realism, small scale, novel subject matter, and independent format. His technique created volumetric illusion through manipulating light and shadow, a change from the usual method of filling in shapes with flat color. Preferring small scale panels to murals, Zeuxis also introduced genre subjects (such as still life) into painting. He contributed to the composite method of composition, and may have originated an approach to, and thus influenced the concept of the ideal form of the nude, as described by art historian Kenneth Clark. As the story goes, Zeuxis could not find a woman beautiful enough to pose as Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world, so he selected the finest features of five different models to create a composite image of ideal beauty. \n\nZeuxis was born in Heraclea in 464 BC, probably Heraclea Lucania, in the present-day region of Basilicata in the southeastern \"boot\" of Italy. He may have studied with Demophilus of Himera (Sicily), or with Neseus of Thasos (an island in the northern Aegean Sea), and/or with the Greek painter Appollodorus. Records cite his notable works as \"Helen\", \"Zeus Enthroned\" and \"The Infant Hercules Strangling the Serpents\". He also painted an assembly of gods, Eros crowned with roses, Alcmene, Menelaus, an athlete, Pan, Marsyas chained, and an old woman. Archelaus I of Macedon employed Zeuxis to decorate the palace of his new capital Pella with a picture of Pan. Most of his works went to Rome and to Byzantium, but disappeared during the time of Pausanias.\n\nZeuxis is said to have died laughing at the humorous way he painted the goddess Aphrodite, after the old woman who commissioned it insisted on modeling for the portrait.\n\nAccording to the \"Naturalis Historia\" of Pliny the Elder, Zeuxis and his contemporary Parrhasius (of Ephesus and later Athens) staged a contest to determine the greater artist. When Zeuxis unveiled his painting of grapes, they appeared so real that birds flew down to peck at them. But when Parrhasius, whose painting was concealed behind a curtain, asked Zeuxis to pull aside that curtain, the curtain itself turned out to be a painted illusion. Parrhasius won, and Zeuxis said, \"I have deceived the birds, but Parrhasius has deceived Zeuxis.\" This story was commonly referred to in 18th- and 19th-century art theory to promote spatial illusion in painting. A similar anecdote says that Zeuxis once drew a boy holding grapes, and when birds, once again, tried to peck them, he was extremely displeased, stating that he must have painted the boy with less skill, since the birds would have feared to approach otherwise.\n\n\n"}

However, while returning from an unsuccessful campaign to extract tribute from the Ala Oromo in 1825, he was betrayed to these people and `Abd al-Karim made himself Emir. Abd al-Rahman appealed for help from his Babille allies, who helped him resist his deposition. In the end, `Abd ar-Rahman was deposed and forty villages are listed as having been destroyed by the Oromo to the north, west and south of harar, as well as in Babille country during this civil war.\n\nAccording to Richard F. Burton, `Abd al-Karim had recruited 60 or 70 Arab matchlockmen, under one Haydar Assal the Auliki, to fight against the Oromo. The mercenaries ran out of ammunition, and losing twenty of their number retired to Harar. The Oromo captured Abd al-Karim and Abd Ar-Rahman, seized the throne and with the aid of the inhabitants started to murder the Arab mercenaries. The mercenaries, however, defended themselves and would have restored Abd al-Rahman as Emir, had Abd ar-Rahman not declined their offer; the Arab mercenaries then drew their pay and marched off to Zeila. R.A. Caulk explains that this was a garbled version of the fraternal battle for the throne.\n\nOne source states that he had one daughter, Guisti Fatima, who married his eventual successor Abu Bakr II ibn `Abd al-Munan.\n\n"}
