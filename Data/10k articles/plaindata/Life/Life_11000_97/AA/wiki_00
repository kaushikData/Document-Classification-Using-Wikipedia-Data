Dickinson is best known as the artillery officer of the small garrison, and the husband of one of the only three non-Mexican survivors to live through the battle, Susanna Dickinson, as well as the father to their infant daughter Angelina, whose life was also spared.\n\nDickinson was born in Tennessee, learning the trade of blacksmithing. He later enlisted in the US Army as a field artilleryman. He and Susannah married when she was just 15, on May 24, 1829, and two years later they moved to the Mexican province of Texas, where they became settlers in the Dewitt Colony. He received a league of land along the San Marcos River, where he started a blacksmith shop, and partnered with George C. Kimble in a hat factory. On December 14, 1834, their only child, Angelina, was born. Following a number of Indian raids on settlements, he joined a band led by fellow settler Bart McClure and took part in hunting down hostile Indians.\n\nIn the fall of 1835, Dickinson served as one of the defenders during the Battle of Gonzales, which marked the beginning of Texas' war for independence. He was elected as First Lieutenant of Artillery in December 1835. He then joined a band of volunteers going to defend San Antonio and became an aide to General Edward Burleson during the Siege of Bexar, with a rank of Lieutenant in the Texian Army. A few weeks later, his home where Susannah and Angelina had remained was looted by members of a Texas Militia, prompting her to join him in San Antonio. They set up residence in the Musquiz house, on the southwest corner of Portero Street and the Main Plaza. When Antonio López de Santa Anna and his troops arrived on February 23, 1836, Dickinson moved his family inside the Alamo.\n\nBy this time, Dickinson held the rank of Captain, and was in command of the Alamo's artillery of twenty-one cannon. Some accounts list him with a rank of Lieutenant at the Alamo, but it is believed he was promoted. The commander, Lieutenant Colonel William Barrett Travis, led a force of between 180 and 250 men. This included Dickinson and others considered to be regular troops, as well as several bands of volunteers, led by frontiersmen James Bowie and Davey Crockett. Historians have established that the Alamo was not lower or higher than those two figures, with most believing the number to have been 182. One of the dispatches sent out by Travis gave the figure of 150 and at least 32 others are known to have arrived after that. Antonio Ruiz, the Mayor of San Antonio at the time, said that after the battle Mexican soldiers had burned 182 bodies of Alamo defenders and that tends to be the accepted strength of it. Santa Anna had under his command between 5,000 and 6,000 Mexican troops. From the time of his arrival, a siege began.\n\nA Mexican bombardment continued through the morning of February 25, 1836. At approximately 10am, about 200–300 Mexican soldiers, mainly cazadores from the Matamoros Battalion, crossed the San Antonio River and took cover in abandoned shacks approximately 90 yards (82 m) to 100 yards (91 m) from the Alamo walls. They were intending to use the huts as cover to erect another artillery battery, although many Texians assumed that they were actually launching an assault on the Alamo. Travis called for volunteers to burn the huts, despite the fact that it was broad daylight and they would be within range of enemy muskets. Charles Despallier, Robert Brown, James Rose and a few others volunteered for the mission.\n\nTo provide cover, Dickinson and his men fired 8-lb cannon, filled with grapeshot and canister, at the Mexican soldiers in the huts. Crockett and his men fired rifles, while other Texians reloaded extra weapons for them. Within two hours, the battle was over. As soon as the Texians saw flames erupting from the huts they threw open the Alamo gate and the Texians re-entered unscathed, although Rose was almost captured by a Mexican officer. The Mexicans retreated with two killed and four wounded, while several Texians had been mildly scratched by flying rock.\n\nAfter learning that a relief force under James Fannin had failed to reach the Alamo and that there was unlikely to be any further reinforcement, a group of 25 men set out from Gonzales at 2pm on Saturday, February 27. The party would number 32 upon its arrival at the Alamo, and was led by Albert Martin and George Kimbell, the latter of whom had been Dickinson's business partner. As they approached the Alamo in the early morning hours of March 1, a rider appeared in front of them and asked, in English, if they wished to go into the fort. When they assented, he turned and told them to follow him. One became suspicious and the rider bolted away. The volunteers were afraid they had been discovered and galloped towards the Alamo. In the darkness, the Texians thought this was a party of Mexican soldiers and fired, wounding one of the volunteers. They finally managed to convince the defenders to open the gates.\n\nAt some point, either on March 3 or March 4, 1836, Travis, seeing that their position was hopeless and their fate sealed, called the troops of his garrison together. He informed them of the situation and gave them the opportunity to either stay or to go at that point. Only one man, Moses Rose, chose to flee, with the rest deciding to remain and fight to the death. He would be remembered, even to the present day, as the \"Coward of the Alamo\", while Dickinson and the rest of the defenders would achieve immortality as heroes.\n\nDickinson survived until the last day of the battle. In the early morning hours of March 6, 1836, Santa Anna sent an assault force which breached the walls of the Alamo with its third charge. Dickinson had hidden Suzanna and Angelina inside the chapel. By her own account afterward, near the end of the battle Dickinson rushed inside where she was hiding, frantically exclaiming \"Great God, Sue! The Mexicans are inside our walls! All is lost! If they spare you, love our child.\" He then returned to his post. By that time there was intense fighting inside the Alamo, which eventually became hand to hand. By reliable Mexican accounts, Dickinson was one of the last defenders killed in action.\n\nAccording to the Mexican Army accounts, the last of the Texians to die were the eleven men manning the two 12-lb cannon in the chapel. The entrance had been barricaded with sandbags, over which the Texians were able to fire. A shot from the 18-lb cannon destroyed the barricades and Mexican soldiers entered the building after firing an initial musket volley. Dickinson's crew fired their cannon from the apse into the soldiers at the door. With no time to reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza, and James Bonham, grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans was master of ordnance and had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder. If he had succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the chapel, killing the women and children hiding in the sacristy.\n\nDickinson's body was burned along with those of the other defenders killed during the battle. Susannah, Angelina, and a freed former slave to Travis named Joe were spared. It is generally accepted that over the course of the battle, the Mexican forces lost an estimated 400 to 500 soldiers killed, while the Texian defenders suffered a total loss of between 182 and 189. Dickinson has since, along with many of the other defenders, become a legend in Texas history for the heroic stand.\n\n"}
{"id": "5219642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5219642", "title": "Amnion (Gap Cycle)", "text": "Amnion (Gap Cycle)\n\nThe Amnion (singular, Amnioni) are a fictional alien species in Stephen R. Donaldson's The Gap Cycle. They are shown to be the only alien race humanity has made contact with and play a major role in the series from \"Forbidden Knowledge\" onwards.\n\nAmnion are fundamentally different from any Earth creature - particularly humankind - in their mental and emotional structure. Physically they are humanoid: the Amnioni with whom first contact is made is described in \"Forbidden Knowledge\" as \"a humanoid sea-anemone with too many arms.\" Amnion are however severely different from each other in physical appearance, with differing numbers of limbs, eyes, and other organs, as well as varying vastly in size and shape. This physical individuality contrasts with their mental identicality - their mentality can be likened to that of an insect hive. They are analogous to the Borg in the Star Trek universe, both in their collective intelligence (or \"mind union\") and in their aim to conquer through assimilation (turning humans into members of their own species).\n\nDespite their fundamental opposition and Cold War-type conflict with humanity, they are not portrayed as the main antagonists in The Gap Cycle. Rather they serve as a driving force for the conflict between the human characters.\n\n\"Forbidden Knowledge\" explains that in the universe of the Gap Cycle, there is some argument over when first contact can be said to have started. Captain Sixten Vertigus, aboard the \"Deep Star\" was the first human to meet an actual Amnioni aboard the Amnion 'defensive' \"Solidarity\": this is where the above description of an Amnioni comes from.\n\nVertigus's instructions were to \"establish proximity with any alien vessel or base\" and then broadcast the contents of a tape prepared specially for the occasion. They would record any reply that they were able to for as long as possible, then to \"escape into the gap in a way that would confuse pursuit\". This seemingly-paranoid set of instructions was due to the unwillingness of Holt Fasner to reveal too much to any alien race \"whose intentions were unguessable\". Vertigus however was willing to disobey these orders directly: something of an idealist, he resolved to travel to the Amnion ship and deliver the tape in person, mostly out of a desire to lay eyes on at least one Amnioni, but also in the hope of kick-starting diplomatic relations between the two races. The Amnion in return gave him a canister containing mutagenic material - the same sort of material that had led Vertigus there in the first place.\n\nThis is where the debate over 'first contact' started from: the Amnion's existence had already been known, and aside from matters of appearance, Captain Vertigus learnt nothing new about the race. The Amnion had been discovered when the ship \"Far Star\" encountered a satellite of alien origin, containing mutagens, in a far extrasolar system. The return of \"Far Star\" to Earth is touted as having \"enough scientific, economic, and cultural impact to qualify as 'first contact'.\"\n\nThe main threat of the Amnion is their mutagenic technology. Mutagens have the ability to rewrite the DNA of a non-Amnioni so it becomes at least partially Amnion. This ability was first discovered by humans during tests on the material discovered in the Amnion satellite - Donaldson remarks that \"Earth science being what it was... the tests eventually included feeding a bit of the substance to a rat.\" This has a drastic effect on the rat, which now resembles \"a mobile clump of seaweed\". Dissection reveals a fundamental genetic change - basic life processes remain intact, but protein and DNA structure are radically different. The new mutants can breed with each other (though not with mutated members of other species) and, most disturbingly, display a significantly increased level of intelligence. When the mutagen was tested on a human being, she only survived for a day and a half - autopsies cite the only possible cause of death as fright. Later in the series the trauma of mutation into an Amnioni is mentioned - this is probably what killed her. Before her death she wrote down galactic co-ordinates, which is where the \"Deep Star\" found the \"Solidarity\". An anti-mutagen drug is developed by Intertech, but one of the many storylines in the series is the suppression of the drug and all research relating to it by the United Mining Companies Police, and why this was done.\n\nThe Amnion are not introduced until \"Forbidden Knowledge\", but play an important part in all four books following.\n\nNote: This list is not intended to be a definitive plot summary, more an overview of the parts the Amnion play, and it is assumed that the article on The Gap Cycle has already been read.\n\nMorn Hyland is taken to Enablement Station to have her child force-grown by the Amnion. This is the only possibility, as she has convinced Nick Succorso that the child is his son. The Amnion expose Morn's deceptions, by informing Nick both that Morn's son is not Nick's son, and that Morn has a zone implant - therefore revealing that her love for him is not real.\n\nThe Amnion wish to study the effects of the zone implant on Morn's son (Davies) and demand that Nick return him to them, but Morn sabotages the escape pod that Davies is in, sending it towards the illegal shipyard of Billingate.\n\nThe Amnion also attempt to study Nick's blood, as he was injected with mutagens last time he visited Enablement, but showed immunity - this is because he has supplies of the immunity drug, given to him by the UMC Police.\n\nThe Amnion repair the gap drive of \"Captain's Fancy\", but sabotage it to test components that they, themselves, are developing that will allow their war ships to travel at near-light space-normal speeds.\n\nThe 'Bill' (the mayor of Billingate, and an illegal) recaptures Davies. Morn is traded to the Amnion, but survives being injected by their mutagens as she has stolen some of Nick's immunity drug.\n\nMilos Taverner, who has come to Billingate with Angus Thermopyle, is injected with mutagens and becomes an Amnioni. Angus, with the help of various members of Nick's crew and Nick himself, recapture Morn - Taverner, as an Amnioni, attempts to use his priority-codes to control Angus, but new programming protects him. Angus sabotages the fusion reactors and destroys Billingate - meanwhile, one Amnion defensive, \"Tranquil Hegemony\", is rammed and destroyed by \"Captain's Fancy\", and the second, \"Calm Horizons\", pursues the fleeing Gap-scout \"Trumpet\".\n\n\"Calm Horizons\", with the aid of the pirate ship \"Soar\", pursues \"Trumpet\". It is revealed that \"Soar\"'s captain, Sorus Chantelaine, is controlled by the Amnion through use of delayed-action mutagens. The cabin boy aboard \"Trumpet\", Ciro Vasaczk, is captured by Sorus and blackmailed into sabotaging the drive of \"Trumpet\" using the same mutagens. \"Calm Horizons\" attempts to destroy \"Trumpet\" to prevent the broadcasting of the anti-mutagen drug formula, but is engaged by the UMCP ship \"Punisher\" and, due to the turning of \"Soar\" against \"Calm Horizons\", is unable to destroy either \"Punisher\" or \"Trumpet\", though \"Soar\" is destroyed. The book ends with \"Calm Horizons\" speeding for Earth.\n\n\"Calm Horizons\" arrives in Earth orbit and threatens to use its super-light proton cannon to destroy the Governing Council for Earth and Space. Warden Dios, head of the UMCP, agrees to go aboard \"Calm Horizons\" and negotiate with Marc Vestabule. He reluctantly agrees to their demands, hoping that the crew of \"Trumpet\", who have taken command of \"Punisher\", can save him. Dios is injected with delayed-action mutagens but is rescued by Davies Hyland, Angus Thermopyle and Vector Shaheed, though Vector dies in the attempt. They escape from \"Calm Horizons\", Angus having sabotaged the super-light proton cannon by filling it with hull sealant, so it explodes when the ship attempts to fire. \"Calm Horizons\" flees, but is destroyed by Ciro Vasaczk using a singularity grenade, though he dies doing so.\n\nThe Amnion do not appear to have individuals in the human sense of the word, or if so, they do not show it. The only Amnion given names are those who were previously human, and have been mutated.\n\n\nAlso of note are the three Amnion ships mentioned:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23497374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23497374", "title": "Bossnapping", "text": "Bossnapping\n\nBossnapping is a form of lock-in where employees detain management in the workplace, often in protest against lay-offs and redundancies, and has especially been carried out in France. The term gained wide usage in the media following a series of bossnapping incidents in the spring of 2009 in France where workers used the tactic in the context of widespread labor unrest resulting from the late 2000s recession.\n\nThese incidents resulted in a public call for an end to the practice by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, despite public opinion polling which showed widespread sympathy for the protesters.\n\nThe term 'bossnapping' began receiving widespread use in the media following a series of high-profile incidents in France in the spring of 2009 where managers were detained by their workers. In early March, 2009, workers in southwestern France held the Chief Executive Officer and Human Resources Director of Sony France overnight, demanding a better severance package for workers who had been laid off.\n\nThey barricaded the entrance to the facility with tree trunks, and held their hostages until the CEO agreed to a renegotiation of the severance package that laid-off workers were to receive. Later that month, workers at a pharmaceutical factory owned by 3M in Pithiviers held their boss in his office demanding similar concessions for laid-off workers as well as protections for remaining workers whose jobs had not been cut. The workers claimed their actions were not intended to be aggressive, but were rather their \"only currency.\" French police did not intervene in either the Sony or 3M incidents, in the expectation that each would be resolved peacefully, as they were in the end.\n\nWorkers in the 3M incident provided a dinner of mussels and French Fries to their kidnapped boss while he was being held.\n\nIn May 2010, workers of a Caterpillar Inc. plant in Grenoble took five managers as hostages to enforce negotiations about 733 job losses. They ended their doing after 10 hours when policemen began to record the names of the participating people.\n\nDuring the same month, about 300 workers of a Toyota factory in Onnaing (Northern France) blocked all entrances and hindered all trucks to leave the premises.\n\nFurther bossnappings took place in a worksite of Hewlett-Packard in France and a lock-in of managers occurred at market research firm Synovate in Auckland, New Zealand as a part of a labor dispute during a contract renegotiation there. The wave of high-profile incidents led to publication of advice for managers who might be bossnapped, although news reports made clear that the hostages had been treated well by their bossnappers. This advice included the preparation of special bossnapping kits that included a change of clothes and a cell phone pre-programmed with numbers of family members, police, and a psychologist who might assist with the psychological stress caused by being the hostage in such an incident.\n\nThese incidents took place in the context of wider French labor unrest related to the recession of the late 2000s, in which many companies in France and across the globe laid off workers during restructuring the companies did in response to falling profits or rising losses. Other labor incidents in France during this period included one in which laid-off workers threw eggs at their manager and burned effigies of him and another in which workers at a car parts factory threatened to blow it up after the factory was closed completely.\n\nIn April, 2009, in response to the ongoing series of bossnapping incidents, French President Nicolas Sarkozy pledged to end the practice, saying, \"We are a nation of laws. I won't allow this sort of thing.\" However, public opinion polls in France at the time showed significant support for those using the strategy, a majority who disapproved of the tactic but sympathized with those practicing it, and only a small minority who completely opposed it. Thus, observers suggested that any strong action on the part of Sarkozy government to end bossnappings, included more proactive action by police to rescue hostages and arrest bossnappers, might lead to further unrest in other forms.\n\n"}
{"id": "857960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=857960", "title": "Burial vault (enclosure)", "text": "Burial vault (enclosure)\n\nA burial vault (also known as a burial liner, grave vault, and grave liner) is a container, formerly made of wood or brick but more often today made of concrete, that encloses a coffin to help prevent a grave from sinking. Wooden coffins (or caskets) decompose, and often the weight of earth on top of the coffin, or the passage of heavy cemetery maintenance equipment over it, can cause the casket to collapse and the soil above it to settle.\n\nThe burial vault or burial liner is designed to prevent the weight of earth or heavy cemetery maintenance equipment from collapsing the coffin beneath. Coffin collapse will cause the ground to sink and settle, marring the appearance of the cemetery and making it harder to maintain. Burial vaults originally emerged as a means of ensuring that grave robbers could not easily access a coffin and remove valuables, clothing, or even bodies from the coffin. Early vaults were made of wood (the \"rough box\"), although by the middle of the 1800s brick, iron and later steel vaults were used. By the late 1800s, the fashion of burying the deceased with jewelry lost favor. However, the value of burial vaults in ensuring that the ground did not settle over graves was seen, and burial vaults began to be more widely used. By the early part of the 20th century, concrete (and, later, reinforced concrete) vaults became more common.\n\nAlthough quite commonly used in many industrialized countries, the burial vault is very much a funerary item used almost exclusively in the 20th century. In the United States, the burial vault was largely unknown until the 1880s when the L.G. Haase Manufacturing Co., which owned a cemetery in Illinois, conceived the burial vault as a means of adding a product line to their funerary sales. As late as 1915, only 5 to 10 percent of funerals in the United States used a burial vault or liner. In the 1930s, company owner Wilbert Haase, who had an interest in Egyptian mummification, began promoting the sealed (or \"waterproof\") vault as a means of allegedly protecting the body from water, microbes, and vermin. The Haase company later purchased several plastics companies, and began manufacturing plastic burial vaults as well. The company dominates the American burial vault market today, with about 12 percent of all vault and liner sales.\n\nA burial vault encloses a casket on all four sides, the top, and the bottom. Modern burial vaults are lowered into the grave, and the casket lowered into the vault. A lid is then lowered to cover the casket and seal the vault. Modern burial vaults may be made of concrete, metal, or plastic. Because the sides of the burial vault are attached to the bottom of the vault, the burial vault is generally stronger than a burial liner. Some burial vaults reverse the construction, so that only a base is placed beneath the coffin. The lid consists of the four sides and the top. These types of burial vaults allow a better seal between the lid and base.\n\nA burial liner is similar to a burial vault, but does not have a bottom. With a burial liner, the coffin is lowered directly onto the earth. The burial liner is then lowered over the casket. Modern burial liners may also be made of concrete, metal, or plastic. Many come in a wide array of colors, even stripes.\n\nBurial vaults do not prevent the decomposition of the human remains within. Vaults which are installed incorrectly and too tightly sealed may not allow gases generated by the decomposing body to escape. Pressure then builds up within the vault until the vault ruptures, causing the vault to fail. Although some manufacturers of burial vaults claim that their vaults are \"green\" (environmentally friendly) and prevent the toxic chemicals used in embalming from leaching into the surrounding soil, such claims are uniformly false since the vault cannot be hermetically sealed without causing it to rupture from the pressure of decomposing gases. A truly \"green\" or natural burial does not use embalming fluids, and does not attempt to protect the body from the soil and rapid decomposition.\n\nModern burial vaults often come in a variety of styles, which can greatly increase the cost. Modern vaults and liners sometimes are lined on the inside with bronze, copper, fiberglass, or stainless steel sheeting, and some vaults and liners are inscribed on the outer surface with words, scenes, or other images.\n\nSome jurisdictions require the use of a burial vault or burial liner. For example, several U.S. states require them. In some cases, cemeteries require the use of a burial vault or liner, although it is not a legal requirement.\n\nData on the use of burial vaults and liners outside the United States is very difficult to come by, and usage rates are not known. Burial vaults and liners are almost unheard of in China and Japan. Cremation is required in China, and is used in 90 percent of burials in Japan. They are also uncommon in Italy. In modern Italy, burial plots (either below-ground or in wall loculi) are re-used after a period of years, usually 10 to 25. At that time, most of the soft body parts have decomposed, and the bones are removed to an ossuary.\n\nIn the United States, the use of burial vaults is also decreasing, caused by a sharp rise in the number of cremations. Whereas 36 percent of all deceased were cremated in the United States in 2008, the National Association of Funeral Directors forecast this to rise to 46 percent by 2015 and 59 percent by 2025.\n\nJewish law does not bar the use of burial vaults or liners, and their use is permitted where law or a cemetery requires them. But Morrison David Bial argues that burial vaults are antithetical to traditional Judaism, in part because they deny the reality of death (e.g., inhibit decomposition of the body) and in part because they are ostentatious and undercut the equality of all people at death.\n\nIslamic law requires only that the body be washed, anointed, and wrapped in linen for burial. Funerals must be kept simple, and no ostentation is allowed. Preferably, the body should be buried without coffin or burial vault, although such is permitted if required by law. Generally, Muslims prefer to have separate cemeteries due to the specific preference for burial without coffin or vault.\n\nBurial vaults and liners do not decompose, and have been criticized as being environmentally unfriendly. Burial vaults and liners consumed more than of steel and more than of reinforced concrete in 2009.\n\nA burial vault or liner is not the only solution to settling earth over the grave. Traditional burials with a casket leave a larger void and thus create more settlement when the casket decomposes or collapses. Natural or \"green\" burials do not use a casket, which means only minimal settling. In either case, the cemetery can remedy sunken graves by filling in the settled area.\n\n"}

(The other being the earlier Selli Event, or OAE 1a, in the Aptian.) The OAE 2 occurred approximately 91.5 ± 8.6 Ma, though other estimates are given as 93-94 Ma. The Cenomanian-Turonian boundary has recently been refined to 93.9 ± 0.15 Ma There was a large carbon disturbance during this time period. However, apart from the carbon cycle disturbance, there were also large disturbances in the oxygen and sulfur cycles of the ocean.\n\nThe event brought about the extinction of the Pliosauridae, and many Ichthyosauria. Coracoids of Maastrichtian age were once interpreted by some authors as belonging to ichthyosaurs, but these have since been interpreted as plesiosaur elements instead. Although the cause is still uncertain, the result starved the Earth's oceans of oxygen for nearly half a million years, causing the extinction of approximately 27 percent of marine invertebrates, including certain planktonic and benthonic foraminifera, mollusks, bivalves, dinoflagellates and calcareaous nannofossils. The global environmental disturbance that resulted in these conditions increased atmospheric and oceanic temperatures. Boundary sediments show an enrichment of trace elements, and contain elevated δ13C values.\n\nThe Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event was first noted by D'Orbigny who named the two stages. The global type section for this boundary is located in the Bridge Creek Limestone Member of the Greenhorn formation near Pueblo Colorado, which are bedded with the Milankovitch orbital signature. Here, a positive carbon-isotope event is clearly shown, although none of the characteristic, organic-rich black shale is present in this type-section. It has been estimated that the isotope shift lasted approximately 850 kyrs longer than the black shale event, which may be the cause of this anomaly in the Colorado type-section. A significantly expanded OAE2 interval from southern Tibet documents a complete, more detailed, and finer-scale structures of the positive carbon isotope excursion that contains multiple shorter-term carbon isotope stages amounting to a total duration of 820±25 kyrs. \n\nIn Europe, the boundary is known as the Bonarelli event because of 1-2 meter layer of thick black shale that marks the boundary. This layer was first studied by Guido Bonarelli in 1981 and is characterized by interbedded black shale, chert and radiolarian sands and has been known to span 400,000 years. Planktonic foraminifera do not exist in this Bonarelli level, and the presence of radiolarians in this section indicates relatively high productivity and an availability of nutrients.\n\nOne possible cause for the occurrence of this event is sub-oceanic volcanism, possibly the Caribbean large igneous province, with increased activity approximately 500,000 years earlier. During that period, the rate of crustal production reached its highest level for 100 million years. This was largely caused by the widespread melting of hot mantle plumes under the oceans at the base of the lithosphere. This resulted in the thickening of the oceanic crust in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This volcanism would have sent large quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, leading to global warming. Within the oceans, the emission of SO, HS, CO, and halogens would have increased the acidity of the water, causing the dissolution of carbonate, and a further release of carbon dioxide. When the volcanic activity declined, this run-away greenhouse effect would have likely been put into reverse. The increased CO content of the oceans could have increased organic productivity in the ocean surface waters. The consumption of this newly abundant organic life by aerobic bacteria would produce anoxia and mass extinction. The resulting elevated levels of carbon burial would account for the black shale deposition in the ocean basins.\n\nThe δ13C isotope found at the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary is one of the main carbon isotope events of the geologic record. It represents one of the largest disturbances in the global carbon cycle from the past 110 million years. This δ13C isotope indicates that the ocean was depleted of oxygen at the time and that there was widespread deposition of organic carbon-rich sediments. Within the positive carbon isotope excursion, short eccentricity scale carbon isotope variability is documented in a significantly expanded OAE2 interval from southern Tibet.\n\nSeveral independent LIP events occurred within the time near the OAE2. Within the time period from 90-95 million years ago, two independent LIP events occurred - the Madagascar and the Caribbean-Colombian. Trace metals such as chromium, scandium, copper and cobalt have been found at the C-T boundary and this suggests that an LIP could have been involved in the occurrence of the event. However, the presence of these trace metals was found corresponding to the time right in the middle of the event as opposed to the beginning, suggesting that the LIP may have occurred during the time, but may not have been the initiator for the event. However, other studies linked the lead isotopes of the OAE2 to the Caribbean-Colombian and the Madagascar LIPs. A modeling study performed in 2011 also confirmed that it is possible that a LIP may have been initiated the event, as the model revealed that the peak amount of carbon dioxide degassing from volcanic LIP degassing could have resulted in more than 90% global deep ocean anoxia.\n\nThe alterations in diversity of various marine invertebrate species such as calcareous nannofossils indicate a time when the oceans were warm and oligotrophic, in an environment with short spikes of productivity followed by long periods of low fertility. A study performed in the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary of Wunstorf, Germany, reveal the uncharacteristic dominance of a calcareous nannofossil species, \"Watznaueria\", present during the event. Unlike the \"Biscutum\" species, which prefer mesotrophic conditions and were generally the dominant species before and after the C/T Boundary event; \"Watznaueria\" species prefer warm, oligotrophic conditions.\n\nAt the time, there were also peak abundances of green algal groups \"Botryococcus\" and \"prasinophytes\", coincident with pelagic sedimentation. The abundances of these algal groups are strongly related to the increase of both the oxygen deficiency in the water column and the total organic carbon content. The evidence from these algal groups suggest that there were episodes of halocline stratification of the water column during the time. A species of freshwater dinocyst - the Bosedinia was also found in the rocks dated to the time and these suggest that the oceans had reduced salinity during the time period.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8015055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8015055", "title": "Critical mass (sociodynamics)", "text": "Critical mass (sociodynamics)\n\nIn social dynamics, critical mass is a sufficient number of adopters of an innovation in a social system so that the rate of adoption becomes self-sustaining and creates further growth. The term is borrowed from nuclear physics and in that field it refers to the amount of a substance needed to sustain a chain reaction.\n\nSocial factors influencing critical mass may involve the size, interrelatedness and level of communication in a society or one of its subcultures. Another is social stigma, or the possibility of public advocacy due to such a factor.\n\nCritical mass may be closer to majority consensus in political circles, where the most effective position is more often that held by the majority of people in society. In this sense, small changes in public consensus can bring about swift changes in political consensus, due to the majority-dependent effectiveness of certain ideas as tools of political debate.\n\nCritical mass is a concept used in a variety of contexts, including physics, group dynamics, politics, public opinion, and technology.\n\nThe concept of critical mass was originally created by game theorist Thomas Schelling and sociologist Mark Granovetter to explain the actions and behaviors of a wide range of people and phenomenon. The concept was first established (although not explicitly named) in Schelling's essay about racial segregation in neighborhoods, published in 1971 in the Journal of Mathematical Sociology, and later refined in his book, \"Micromotives and Macrobehavior\", published in 1978. He did use the term \"critical density\" with regard to pollution in his \"On the Ecology of Micromotives\". Mark Granovetter, in his essay \"Threshold models of collective behavior\", published in the American Journal of Sociology in 1978 worked to solidify the theory. Everett Rogers later cites them both in his important work \"Diffusion of Innovations\", in which critical mass plays an important role.\n\nThe concept of critical mass had existed before it entered a sociology context. It was an established concept in medicine, specifically epidemiology, since the 1920s, as it helped to explain the spread of illnesses.\n\nIt had also been a present, if not solidified, idea in the study of consumer habits and economics, especially in General Equilibrium Theory. In his papers, Schelling quotes the well-known \"The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism\" paper written in 1970 by George Akerlof. Similarly, Granovetter cited the Nash Equilibrium game in his papers.\n\nFinally, Herbert A. Simon's essay, \"Bandwagon and underdog effects and the possibility of election predictions\", published in 1954 in Public Opinion Quarterly, has been cited as a predecessor to the concept we now know as critical mass.\n\nCritical mass and the theories behind it help us to understand aspects of humans as they act and interact in a larger social setting. Certain theories, such as Mancur Olson's Logic of Collective Action or Garrett Hardin's Tragedy of the Commons, work to help us understand why humans do or adopt certain things which are beneficial to them, or, more importantly, why they do not. Much of this reasoning has to do with individual interests trumping that which is best for the collective whole, which may not be obvious at the time.\n\nOliver, Marwell, and Teixeira tackle this subject in relation to critical theory in a 1985 article published in the American Journal of Sociology. In their essay, they define that action in service of a public good as \"collective action\". \"Collective Action\" is beneficial to all, regardless of individual contribution. By their definition, then, \"critical mass\" is the small segment of a societal system that does the work or action required to achieve the common good. The \"Production Function\" is the correlation between resources, or what individuals give in an effort to achieve public good, and the achievement of that good. Such function can be decelerating, where there is less utility per unit of resource, and in such a case, resource can taper off. On the other hand, the function can be accelerating, where the more resources that are used the bigger the payback. \"Heterogeneity\" is also important to the achievement of a common good. Variations (heterogeneity) in the value individuals put on a common good or the effort and resources people give is beneficial, because if certain people stand to gain more, they are willing to give or pay more.\n\nCritical mass theory in gender politics and collective political action is defined as the critical number of personnel needed to affect policy and make a change not as the token but as an influential body. This number has been placed at 30%, before women are able to make a substantial difference in politics. However, other research suggests lower numbers of women working together in legislature can also affect political change. Kathleen Bratton goes so far as to say that women, in legislatures where they make up less than 15% of the membership, may actually be encouraged to develop legislative agendas that are distinct from those of their male colleagues. Others argue that we should look more closely at parliamentary and electoral systems instead of critical mass.\n\nWhile critical mass can be applied to many different aspects of sociodynamics, it becomes increasingly applicable to innovations in interactive media such as the telephone, fax, or email. With other non-interactive innovations, the dependence on other users was generally sequential, meaning that the early adopters influenced the later adopters to use the innovation. However, with interactive media, the interdependence was reciprocal, meaning both users influenced each other. This is due to the fact that interactive media have high network effect, where in the value and utility of a good or service increases the more users it has. Thus, the increase of adopters and quickness to reach critical mass can therefore be faster and more intense with interactive media, as can the rate at which previous users discontinue their use. The more people that use it, the more beneficial it will be, thus creating a type of snowball effect, and conversely, if users begin to stop using the innovation, the innovation loses utility, thus pushing more users to discontinue their use.\n\nIn M. Lynne Markus' essay in \"Communication Research\" entitled \"Toward a 'Critical Mass' Theory of Interactive Media\", several propositions are made that try to predict under what circumstances interactive media is most likely to achieve critical mass and reach universal access, a \"common good\" using Oliver, \"et al\".'s terminology. One proposition states that such media's existence is all or nothing, where in if universal access is not achieved, then, eventually, use will discontinue. Another proposition suggests that a media's ease of use and inexpensiveness, as well as its utilization of an \"active notification capability\" will help it achieve universal access. The third proposition states that the heterogeneity, as discussed by Oliver, et al. is beneficial, especially if users are dispersed over a larger area, thus necessitating interactivity via media. Fourth, it is very helpful to have highly sought-after individuals to act as early adopters, as their use acts as incentive for later users. Finally, Markus posits that interventions, both monetarily and otherwise, by governments, businesses, or groups of individuals will help a media reach its critical mass and achieve universal access.\n\nAn example put forth by Rogers in \"Diffusion of Innovations\" was that of the fax machine, which had been around for almost 150 years before it became popular and widely used. It had existed in various forms and for various uses, but with more advancements in the technology of faxes, including the use of existing phone lines to transmit information, coupled with falling prices in both machines and cost per fax, the fax machine reached a critical mass in 1987, when \"Americans began to assume that 'everybody else' had a fax machine\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12577392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12577392", "title": "Damon Dran", "text": "Damon Dran\n\nDamon Dran is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Primarily an enemy of Black Widow and Daredevil, the character exists within Marvel's main shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe. Created by writer Gerry Conway and artist Gene Colan, the character first appeared in \"Daredevil\" Vol. 1, #92 (October 1972).\n\nDran debuted in a three-part story that took place in \"Daredevil\" Vol. 1, #92-94 and went on to appear in \"Marvel Fanfare\" Vol. 1, #11-13 and \"Captain America\" Vol. #1, #429-430 before being killed off in \"Black Widow\" Vol. 5, #4-6.\n\nAn unscrupulous munitions magnate, Damon Dran became paranoid regarding his own mortality and so secretly commissioned the creation of Project Four, a weapon that would imbue him with the power necessary to survive the \"inevitable\" World War III. After Project Four was stolen by Black Widow and Danny French, Dran spent years trying to locate it and eventually tracked both French and Black Widow down to San Francisco, where he had them captured and brought to his mansion in Berkeley. Dran is able to discern Project Four's whereabouts by subjecting French to a mind probe, and while the device is prepared for him he sets Blue Talon and a brainwashed Black Widow against Black Widow's partner Daredevil.\n\nDaredevil survives the attempts on his life and locates Dran's manor, breaking into it just as Dran uses Project Four to become the \"Indestructible Man\". With his new powers, Dran sets out to massacre and subjugate humanity and easily resists Daredevil, Black Widow and the National Guard's attempts to prevent him from reaching San Francisco. French joins the fray and sacrifices himself to destroy Project Four, weakening Dran enough for him to be taken down by Daredevil and Black Widow.\n\nDran was left disfigured and was robbed of his abilities by the battle, but his invulnerability and super strength at some point returned and he began plotting his revenge against Black Widow. Dran lures Black Widow to Russia (where he frames her for murder) and then to Hong Kong by abducting her friend Ivan Petrovich. Black Widow defeats all of the mercenaries that Dran sends to Hong Kong to capture her, but is subdued by and brought to a private island by Dran's personal assassin Snapdragon. There, Dran reveals that he intends to further ruin Black Widow's life by having a duplicate of her destroy the Helicarrier and kill Nick Fury. Black Widow is able to escape with Petrovich and alert Fury to the threat of her doppelganger, who Fury shoots before bombing Dran's island.\n\nSetting up anew in Louisiana, Dran began abducting children, selling some to buyers overseas and the rest to Helmut and Heike Zemo. When Diamondback and Moonhunter began investigating the death of Dran's former minion Snapdragon, the two are captured and brought to Dran's estate by his new agent, Golddigger. Captain America and Americop break into Dran's mansion, the former in search of Diamondback and Moonhunter and the latter in search of the kidnapped children, and are subdued by Dran and his lackeys, but in the confusion Diamondback escapes and contacts Black Widow, who helps her free Captain America and Moonhunter. Americop, who had escaped on his own, locates Dran, shoots down his getaway helicopter and leaves him to be arrested by Black Widow.\n\nDran escapes from custody and goes into hiding, managing to evade even S.H.I.E.L.D. At some point, Dran began to lose his invincibility, which he tried restore through cybernetic implants. After making the acquaintance of Molot Boga, a deranged and excommunicated monk, Dran molded the man into becoming his personal assassin, the \"Hammer of God\". From a sealed chamber in the heart of his fortified yacht, Dran instructs Boga to begin eliminating his enemies, starting with a Ukrainian diplomat.\n\nBlack Widow becomes involved due to being present at the Ukrainian embassy when it is bombed by Boga. While Black Widow fails to stop Boga from taking out his next target, a Croatian ambassador, she does manage to prevent him from claiming his third victim, a diplomat at the Gatwick Airport. While Dran recovers the mortally wounded Boga and saves his life by giving him bionic implants similar to his own, Black Widow learns that Dran's yacht is situated near the coast of Montenegro.\n\nBlack Widow boards Dran's ship, kills his henchmen and Molot, and delivers him to S.H.I.E.L.D. While in custody, Dran rants about an organization called Chaos and dies in his cell when it is flooded with an acidic gas released by a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who had been corrupted by Chaos.\n\nThe Project Four device that he funded the creation of gave Dran superhuman strength and invulnerability, allowed him to increase his size and gave him the ability to project energy beams from his hands. The full extent of Dran's indestructibility is unknown, but it allowed him to survive his island being blown up by a S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and possibly removed his need for basic human necessities such as air, as he at one point breathed in knockout gas to no ill-effect. Project Four being destroyed by Danny French temporarily robbed Dran of his powers, but his strength and invincibility at some point returned; Dran eventually lost those powers as well, however, and made a crude attempt at replicating them through the use of cybernetic implants which required stabilizers in the form of U.V. lights and special pills. The implants proved to be nowhere near as effective as Dran's former abilities, as they completely failed to protect him from a corrosive gas attack.\n\n"}

Brought up at Douai as a Roman Catholic by Jesuit priests, he was converted to Protestantism in 1682 and came to abjure popery, and published \"Protestancy proved Safer than Popery\" (1686).\n\nHis medical reputation was based on his \"Tuta ac efficax luis venereae saepe absque mercurio ac semper absque salivatione mercuriali curando methodus\" (1684) which was translated into French, Dutch and German. Two other works by him were \"De Pulsus Variatione\" (1685), and \"Ars explorandi medicas facultates plantarum ex solo sapore\" (1688); his \"Opuscula\" were collected in 1687. These professional writings gave him a place and memorial in Albrecht von Haller, \"Bibliotheca Medicinae Practicae\" (1779). According to Haller he was alive early in the 18th century.\n\nHe also wrote some books in theology and philosophy, controversial in their time but little remembered today. But the most noticeable of his productions is \"A Discourse of Wit\" (1685), which contains some of the most characteristic metaphysical opinions of the Scottish philosophy of common sense. It was followed by \"Academia Scientiarum\" (1687), and by \"A Moral Discourse of the Power of Interest\" (1690), dedicated to Robert Boyle, Abercromby's patron in the 1680s. He later wrote \"Reasons Why A Protestant Should not Turn Papist\" (1687), which has often wrongly been attributed to Boyle. \"A Short Account of Scots Divines\", by him, was printed at Edinburgh in 1833, edited by James Maidment.\n\n"}

He is noted for his leading role as peace-loving Shaolin monk, Kwai Chang Caine, in the television series \"Kung Fu\" (1972–1975). He was also known for playing Frankenstein in \"Death Race 2000\" (1975) and Bill in both \"Kill Bill\" films (–).\n\nHe was a member of the Carradine family of actors that began with his father, John Carradine. His father's acting career, which included major and minor roles on stage and television, and in cinema, spanned over four decades. A prolific \"B\" movie actor, David Carradine appeared in more than 100 feature films in a career spanning over sixty years. He received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award for his work on \"Kung Fu\", and received three further Golden Globe nominations for his performances in Woody Guthrie biopic \"Bound for Glory\" (1976), the miniseries \"North and South\" (1985), and Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Volume 2\", for which he won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nFilms that featured Carradine continued to be released after his death. These posthumous credits were from a variety of genres including action, documentaries, drama, horror, martial arts, science fiction, and westerns. In addition to his acting career, Carradine was a director and musician. Moreover, influenced by his \"Kung Fu\" role, he studied martial arts. On April 1, 1997, Carradine received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nHe was arrested and prosecuted for a variety of offenses, which often involved substance abuse. On June 3, 2009, he was found dead in a closet in his hotel room in Bangkok, Thailand due to a fatal autoerotic asphyxiation accident.\n\nCarradine was born on December 8, 1936, as John Arthur Carradine, in Hollywood, California, the oldest child of actor John Carradine and his wife Ardanelle Abigail (McCool). He was a half-brother of Bruce, Keith, Christopher, and Robert Carradine, and an uncle of Ever Carradine and Martha Plimpton, most of whom are also actors. Primarily of Irish descent, he was a great-grandson of Methodist evangelical author Beverly Carradine and a grandnephew of artist Will Foster.\n\nCalled \"Jack\" by his family, Carradine's childhood was turbulent. His parents divorced and repeatedly remarried; he was born to his mother's second marriage of three, and his father's first of four. At the time of Carradine's parents' marriage, his mother already had a son by her first husband, whom John adopted. John Carradine planned a large family, but after his wife had a series of miscarriages, he discovered she had had numerous abortions without his knowledge. This rendered her unable to carry a baby to full term. Against this backdrop of marital discord, David almost succeeded in committing suicide by hanging at the age of five. He said the incident followed his discovery that he and his older half-brother, Bruce, who had been adopted by John, had different biological fathers. Carradine added, \"My father saved me, and then confiscated my comic book collection and burned it – which was scarcely the point.\"\n\nAfter three years of marriage, Ardenelle filed for divorce from John, but the couple remained married for another five years. Divorce finally came in 1944, when Carradine was seven years old. His father left California to avoid court action in the alimony settlement. After the couple engaged in a series of court battles over child custody and alimony, which at one point landed John in jail, Jack joined his father in New York City. By this time, his father had remarried. For the next few years David was shuffled between boarding schools, foster homes, and reform school. He also would often accompany his father while the elder Carradine performed summer theater throughout the Northeast. Carradine spent time in Massachusetts and even one miserable winter milking cows on a farm in Vermont.\n\nEventually, David Carradine returned to California, where he graduated from Oakland High School. He attended Oakland Junior College (currently Laney College) for a year before transferring to San Francisco State College, where he studied drama and music theory, and wrote music for the drama department's annual revues while juggling work at menial jobs, a fledgling stage acting career, and his studies. After he dropped out of college, Carradine spent some time with the \"beatniks\" of San Francisco's North Beach and southern California's Venice. During this time he collected unemployment insurance and sold baby pictures. He was also prosecuted for disturbing the peace.\n\nDespite an attempt to dodge the draft, in 1960 Carradine was inducted into the United States Army, where he drew pictures for training aids. That Christmas he married his high school sweetheart, Donna Lee Becht. While stationed at Fort Eustis, Virginia he helped to establish a theater company that became known as the \"entertainment unit.\" He met fellow inductee Larry Cohen, who later cast him in \"Q, The Winged Serpent.\" He also faced court-martial for shoplifting. In 1962, Donna gave birth to their daughter, Calista. Carradine was honorably discharged after a two-year tour.\n\nUpon leaving the Army, Carradine became serious about his acting pursuits. It was at that time that he was advised to change his name to avoid confusion with his famous father. In 1963, he made his television debut on an episode of \"Armstrong Circle Theatre\". Several other television roles were to follow including appearances on \"Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre\" and \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour.\" He made his feature film debut in 1964 in \"Taggart\", a western based on a novel by Louis L'Amour.\n\nHis first big break, however, came with his second Broadway part in \"The Royal Hunt of the Sun\", a play by Peter Shaffer about the destruction of the Inca empire by conquistador Francisco Pizarro. He said of this performance, \"Many of the important roles that I got later on were because the guy who was going to hire me was in that audience and had his mind blown.\" For that part, Carradine won a Theatre World Award for Best Debut Performance in 1965.\n\nWith the closing of \"The Royal Hunt of the Sun\", and the failing of his marriage, Carradine left New York and headed back to California. He returned to TV to star in the short-lived series \"Shane\", a 1966 western based upon a 1949 novel of the same name and previously filmed in 1953.\n\nCarradine guest-starred opposite David McCallum in a 1971 episode of \"Night Gallery\" titled \"The Phantom Farmhouse.\" Also in 1971, Carradine played a hippie reprobate opposite Sally Field in the well-received television movie \"Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring\".\n\nIn 1972, he co-starred as \"Big\" Bill Shelly in one of Martin Scorsese's earliest films, \"Boxcar Bertha\", which starred Barbara Hershey, his domestic partner at the time (see Personal life). This was one of several Roger Corman productions in which he was to appear. It was also one of a handful of acting collaborations he did with his father, John.\n\nFor three seasons, Carradine starred as a half-Chinese, half-white Shaolin monk, Kwai Chang Caine, on the ABC hit TV series \"Kung Fu\" (1972–1975) and was nominated for an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for the role. The show, which took place in the Old West, helped, with Bruce Lee movies, to popularize the martial arts and Eastern philosophy in the west, and immortalized the character of Kwai Chang Caine, also referred to as \"Grasshopper,\" in popular culture.\n\nAlthough the choice of a white man to play the role of Kwai Chang Caine stirred controversy, the show served as steady employment for several Asian-American actors in the U.S. In addition to Keye Luke and Philip Ahn, who held leading roles in the cast as Caine's Shaolin masters, Robert Ito, James Hong, Benson Fong, Richard Loo, and Victor Sen Yung frequently appeared in the series. \"Kung Fu\" ended when Carradine quit to pursue a movie career, but he reprised the role of Kwai Chang Caine in 1986 in \"\". Brandon Lee, son of Bruce Lee, in his acting debut, portrayed his son.\n\nIn 1991, he reprised the role of Caine in a cameo appearance in the TV movie \"The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw\", in which Caine uses his Chinese friends to help the title character in 1903 San Francisco.\n\nEarly in the 1990s, Carradine once again reprised the role of Kwai Chang Caine in \"\" (1993–97) playing the grandson of the original character of the same name. Carradine starred in the program and served as executive producer and director. The program offered him the opportunity to recreate the character for which he was most widely recognized. The show was canceled in 1997, after four seasons and 88 episodes.\n\nImmediately following the \"Kung Fu\" series, Carradine accepted the role as the race car driver \"Frankenstein\" in \"Death Race 2000\" (1975), he said, to \"kill the image of Caine and launch a movie career.\" The Roger Corman exploitation film became a cult classic. It was based on Ib Melchior's first science fiction work, a short story called \"The Racer\". Carradine was tapped to play Duke Leto Atreides in Alejandro Jodorowsky's aborted \"Dune\" adaptation in the late 1970s.\n\nIn 1976, Carradine earned critical praise for his portrayal of folksinger Woody Guthrie in Hal Ashby's \"Bound for Glory\" (1976) for which he won a National Board of Review Award for Best Actor. He was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award and New York Film Critics Circle Award for his role as Guthrie. Carradine worked very closely with his friend, singer-songwriter-guitarist Guthrie Thomas, on the \"Bound for Glory\" film. Thomas assisted Carradine in the guitar style of the period and the songs that had been chosen to be in the film itself.\n\nNext came the role of the alcoholic, unemployed trapeze artist Abel Rosenberg in \"The Serpent's Egg\" (1977). Set in post-World War I Berlin, \"The Serpent's Egg\", which also starred Liv Ullmann, is together with \"The Touch\" one of the two only English-language films made by legendary Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. Bergman said of his leading man, \"I don't believe in God, but Heaven must have sent him.\" Carradine said that he and Bergman had plans for further collaboration, but the director's affection for the actor waned when the latter passionately protested a scene that included the butchering of a horse. The altercation caused Carradine to question the fate of Bergman's soul while the director declared, \"Little Brother, I am an old whore. I have shot two other horses, burned one and strangled a dog.\"\n\nWhen Bruce Lee died in 1973, he left an unreleased movie script that he had developed with James Coburn and Stirling Silliphant called \"The Silent Flute\". The script became \"Circle of Iron\" (1978), and in the film, Carradine played the four roles that were originally intended for Lee. Carradine considered this to be among his best work.\n\nIn 1980 Carradine appeared in \"The Long Riders\" (1980), with his half-brothers Keith and Robert Carradine. The ensemble cast included three other brother/actor groupings: Stacy and James Keach; Dennis and Randy Quaid, and Christopher and Nicholas Guest. The movie, which was about the Jesse James gang, gave Carradine, who played Cole Younger, one of his most memorable roles.\n\nThroughout most of the 1980s and 1990s, David Carradine's acting career suffered a decline. Although he continued to amass movie and television credits, few of his roles garnered much attention. Most of his work was released straight to video. However, a few of his movies, such as \"The Warrior and the Sorceress\" (1984), \"\" (1990) and \"Sonny Boy\" (1989), developed cult followings. In 1989 he starred in the low budget direct-to-video Swedish action movie \"The Mad Bunch\" directed by Mats Helge Olsson, making him one of three actors (including Heinz Hopf and Tor Isedal) who have starred in both an Ingmar Bergman movie and an Olsson movie. In 1997, Carradine was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The presenters played an April Fool's Day prank on him by first unveiling a star bearing the name of his brother, Robert. In 2000, he had a small part in the movie \"By Dawn's Early Light\".\n\nCarradine enjoyed a revival of his fame when he was cast in Quentin Tarantino's sequential \"Kill Bill\" movies, in 2003 and 2004. Among those who thought his portrayal of Bill, the assassin extraordinaire, would earn him an Academy Award nomination was Scott Mantz of \"The Mediadrome\", who said, \"Carradine practically steals every scene he's in with confident gusto, and he gives a soulful performance that should all but ensure a spot on next year's Oscar ballot.\" Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper each had \"Kill Bill Vol. 2\" on their top ten list for of Academy Awards predictions. Although the films received no notice from the Academy, Carradine did receive a Golden Globe nomination and a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Bill.\n\nCarradine also appeared as a mysterious martial artist, The Master, in the 2009 DVD premier \"Big Stan\".\n\nCarradine attracted notice in 1985 when he appeared in a major supporting role in \"North and South\", a miniseries about the American Civil War, as the evil and abusive Justin LaMotte. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. He also appeared in \"North and South, Book II\", telecast in May 1986.\n\nIn addition, he was featured in a Lipton Tea commercial, which first aired during the broadcast of Super Bowl XXVIII. The advertisement paid tribute to The Three Stooges while satirizing his role in \"Kung Fu\". In 1999, he made an appearance as the demon Tempus in the Season 1 finale episode of \"Charmed\". In 2001, he appeared in the episode \"The Serpent\" of the syndicated TV series \"Queen of Swords\" as the sword-wielding bandit \"El Serpiente\" filmed at Texas Hollywood studios in Almeria, Spain, home of many spaghetti westerns. David also did a guest appearance in episode 11 of \"Lizzie McGuire\" as himself and also starring his brother Robert who plays Lizzie’s father. David Carradine took over hosting duties from his brother Keith on \"Wild West Tech\" on the History Channel, in 2005. The same year he also played both himself and the ghost of a dead man for an episode of the NBC TV show \"Medium\". By 2006, he had become the spokesperson for Yellowbook, a publisher of independent telephone directories in the United States. He also appeared as the ghost of time, Clockwork, in two episodes of the animated series, \"Danny Phantom\". He also starred in the 2008 TV movie, \"Kung Fu Killer\", in which he played a Chinese martial arts master very similar to his \"Kung Fu\" series \"Caine\" persona—his character in this movie named \"White Crane\", and mostly referred to or addressed as \"C\"r\"and,\" frequently spoken with a sort of accent that minimized the R sound.\n\nThe actor, who once received an award for being the hardest working member of his profession in Hollywood, still had approximately a dozen films in \"post-production\" at the time of his death in 2009. Most of these roles were cameos or small parts in independent, direct to DVD productions. Among them, a horror film, \"Dark Fields\" (2009); an action film, \"Bad Cop\" (2009); and a western, \"All Hell Broke Loose\" (2009).\n\nCarradine also appeared in a minor role in Yuen Woo-ping's Chinese kung fu epic \"True Legend\". Carradine and Yuen first met while filming \"Kill Bill\". Yuen eulogized Carradine on the \"True Legend\" website, describing him as a \"good friend.\" Yuen said of Carradine: \n\nOne of Carradine's last leading roles was in the period drama \"Golden Boys\", set in 1905. It had only a limited theater run, and received little critical attention. It was released on DVD shortly after his death.\n\nHis final released movie was the cult Indy film, \"Night of the Templar\", directed by his friend Paul Sampson, in which Carradine wielded a sword (katana) for the final time on screen. Almost like a foreshadowing, there are several peculiar and eerie references in the film that are coincidental to Carradine's untimely passing which include cross dressing and auto erotic asphyxiation. His last scene on screen ended in the following dialog: \"Well, old friend, see you in the next lifetime\" / \"Yeah, Old Friends, Old Soul Mates\" / \"Yes, we are.\"\n\nCarradine co-produced a full-length documentary about luthier Stuart Mossman, which has been identified as the actor's last film appearance. \"The Legend of Stuart Mossman: A Modern Stradivari\", directed by Barry Brown, premiered at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, in February 2010. It featured David, Keith, and Robert Carradine performing their music on Mossman guitars. Mossman had appeared with Carradine in \"Cloud Dancer\" (1980), which Brown also directed, and in \"The Long Riders\".\n\nOn the small screen, Carradine appeared in a guest spot on the television series \"Mental\" that was broadcast just days after his death. On October 3, 2009, \"Celebrity Ghost Stories\" premiered on the Biography Channel with an interview of Carradine discussing his belief that his closet was haunted by his wife's deceased previous husband. The segment, which was described as \"eerie,\" was filmed four months before his own death. In his last of many collaborations with producer Roger Corman, Carradine appeared in the \"Syfy Channel\"s science fiction monster movie \"Dinocroc Vs. Supergator\", over a year after he died. Ken Tucker, writing for Entertainment Weekly, said the film was \"impeccable\" and \"goofy fun all the way.\" At the time of this release, there were still four more unreleased films that credited David Carradine, including \"Stretch\", which he was filming at the time of his death.\n\nCarradine made his directorial debut on three episodes of \"Kung Fu\". While still performing on \"Kung Fu\", he tried his hand at directing some independent films of his own. \"Americana\" (1983), took ten years to complete due to difficulty in financing. It featured Carradine in the starring role and several of his friends and family members in supporting roles. The film won the People's Choice Award at the Director's Fortnight at Cannes, but failed to achieve critical support or adequate distribution. Other directorial attempts included \"You and Me\" (1975), and two unreleased productions: \"Mata Hari\", an epic that starred his daughter, Calista; and a short musical called \"A Country Mile\".\n\nCarradine knew nothing of the practice of kung fu at the time he was cast in the role of Kwai Chang Caine; instead, he relied on his experience as a dancer for the part. He also had experience in sword fighting, boxing, and street fighting on which to draw. For the first half of the original series, David Chow provided technical assistance with kung fu. He never considered himself a master of the art, but rather an \"evangelist\" of kung fu. By 2003 he had acquired enough expertise in martial arts to produce and star in several instructional videos on T'ai chi and Qigong. In 2005, Carradine visited the Shaolin Monastery in Henan, China as part of the extra features for the third season of the \"Kung Fu\" DVDs. During his visit, the abbot, Shi Yǒngxìn, said that he recognized Carradine's important contribution to the promotion of the Shaolin Monastery and kung fu culture, to which Carradine replied, \"I am happy to serve.\"\n\nIn addition to his acting career, Carradine was a musician. He sang and played the piano, the guitar and the flute among other instruments. In 1970, Carradine played one half of a flower power beatnik duo in the season 4 \"Ironside\" episode \"The Quincunx,\" performing the songs \"I Stepped on a Flower,\" \"Lonesome Stranger,\" and \"Sorrow of the Singing Tree.\" He recorded an album titled \"Grasshopper\", which was released in 1975. His musical talents were often integrated into his screen performances. He performed several of Woody Guthrie's songs for the movie \"Bound for Glory\". For the \"Kung Fu\" series he made flutes out of bamboo that he had planted on the Warner Brothers lot. He later made several flutes for the movie \"Circle of Iron\", one of which he later played in \"Kill Bill\". Carradine wrote and performed the theme songs for at least two movies that he starred in, \"Americana\" and \"Sonny Boy\". The first line from the \"Sonny Boy\" theme, \"Paint\", which he wrote while filming \"Americana\" in Drury, Kansas, in 1973, is engraved on his headstone. He wrote and performed several songs for \"American Reel\" (2003) and wrote the score for \"You and Me\". He and his brother, Robert, also performed with a band, the \"Cosmic Rescue Team\" (also known as \"Soul Dogs\"). The band performed primarily in small venues and benefits.\n\nShortly after being drafted into the Army in 1960, Carradine proposed marriage to Donna Lee Becht (born September 26, 1937), whom he had met while they were students at Oakland High School. They were married on Christmas Day that year. She lived with him off-base in Virginia while he was stationed at Fort Eustis. In April 1962, she gave birth to their daughter Calista. After Carradine's discharge, the family lived in New York while Carradine established his acting career, appearing on Broadway in \"The Deputy\" and \"Royal Hunt of the Sun\". The marriage dissolved in 1968, whereupon Carradine left New York and headed back to California to continue his television and film careers.\n\nIn 1969, Carradine met actress Barbara Hershey while the two of them were working on \"Heaven with a Gun\". The pair lived together until 1975. They appeared in other films together, including Martin Scorsese's \"Boxcar Bertha\". In 1972, they appeared together in a nude \"Playboy\" spread, recreating some sex scenes from \"Boxcar Bertha\". That year, Hershey gave birth to their son, Free (who at age nine changed his name to Tom, much to his father's chagrin). The couple's relationship fell apart around the time of Carradine's 1974 burglary arrest, when Carradine began an affair with Season Hubley, who had guest-starred on \"Kung Fu\". Carradine was engaged to Hubley for a time, but they never married.\n\nIn February 1977, Carradine married, in a civil ceremony in Munich, Germany, his second wife, Linda (née Linda Anne Gilbert), immediately following the filming of \"The Serpent's Egg\". Gilbert was previously married to Roger McGuinn of The Byrds. Their daughter, Kansas, was born in 1978.\n\nCarradine's second marriage ended in divorce, as did the two that followed. He was married to Gail Jensen from 1986 to 1997. She died in April 2010, at the age of 60, of an alcohol-related illness. He was married to Marina Anderson from 1998 to 2001. By this time, Carradine had proclaimed himself to be a \"serial monogamist.\"\n\nOn December 26, 2004, Carradine married the widowed Annie Bierman (née Anne Kirstie Fraser, born December 21, 1960) at the seaside Malibu home of his friend Michael Madsen. Vicki Roberts, his attorney and a longtime friend of his wife's, performed the ceremony. With this marriage he acquired three stepdaughters, Amanda Eckelberry (born 1989), Madeleine Rose (born 1995), and Olivia Juliette (born 1998) as well as a stepson, actor Max Richard Carradine (born 1998).\n\nIn one of his final interviews, Carradine stated that at 71, he was still \"in excellent shape,\" attributing it to a good diet and having a youthful circle of friends. \"Everybody that I know is at least 10 or 20 years younger than I am. My wife Annie is 24 years younger than I am. My daughter asks why I don't hang with women my age and I say, 'Most of the women my age are a lot older than me!\n\nBy his own account, in the late 1950s, while living in San Francisco, Carradine was arrested for assaulting a police officer. He pled guilty to a lesser charge of disturbing the peace. While in the Army, he faced court-martial, on more than one occasion, for shoplifting. After he became an established actor and had changed his name to David, he was arrested in 1967 for possession of marijuana.\n\nAt the height of his popularity in \"Kung Fu\", in 1974 Carradine was arrested again, this time for attempted burglary and malicious mischief. While under the influence of peyote, Carradine began wandering nude around his Laurel Canyon neighborhood. He broke into a neighbor's home, smashing a window and cutting his arm. He then bled all over the homeowner's piano. At some time during this incident he accosted two young women, allegedly assaulting one while asking if she was a witch. The police literally followed a trail of blood to his home. The burglary charges were dropped when nothing was found to be missing. Carradine pleaded no contest to the mischief charge and was given probation. He was never charged with assault, but the young woman sued him for $1.1 million and was awarded $20,000.\n\nIn 1980, while in South Africa filming \"Safari 3000\" (also known as \"Rally\"), which co-starred Stockard Channing, Carradine was arrested for possession of marijuana. He was convicted and given a suspended sentence. He claimed that he was framed, in this case, by the apartheid government, as he had been seen dancing with Tina Turner.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Carradine was arrested at least twice for driving under the influence of alcohol, once in 1984 and again in 1989. In the second case, Carradine pleaded no contest. Of this incident, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported: \"legal experts say Carradine was handed a harsher-than-average sentence, even for a second-time offender: three years' summary probation, 48 hours in jail, 100 hours of community service, 30 days' work picking up trash for the California Department of Transportation, attendance at a drunk driving awareness meeting and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.\"\n\nIn 1994, while in Toronto filming \"\", Carradine was arrested for kicking in a door at SkyDome while attending a Rolling Stones concert. When asked his reasoning, Carradine claimed he was worried about getting swarmed by people who recognized him, and so entered the building as quickly as possible.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, at the age of 72, David Carradine was found dead in his room at the Swissôtel Nai Lert Park Hotel on Wireless Road, near Sukhumvit Road, in central Bangkok, Thailand. He was in Bangkok to shoot his latest film, titled \"Stretch\". A police official said that Carradine was found naked, hanging by a rope in the room's closet, causing immediate speculation that his death was suicide. However, reported evidence suggested that his death was accidental, the result of autoerotic asphyxiation. Two autopsies were conducted, one involving the celebrity pathologist Pornthip Rojanasunan, and both concluded that the death was not a suicide. The cause of death became widely accepted as \"accidental asphyxiation.\"\n\nImmediately following his death, two of Carradine's former wives, Gail Jensen and Marina Anderson, stated publicly that his sexual interests included the practice of self-bondage. Anderson, who had plans to publish a tell-all book about her marriage to Carradine, said in an interview with \"Access Hollywood\", \"There was a dark side to David, there was a very intense side to David. People around him know that.\" Previously, in her divorce filing, she had claimed that \"it was the continuation of abhorrent and deviant sexual behavior which was potentially deadly.\"\n\nPhotographs of Carradine at the death scene, as well as photographs of his autopsied body, were circulated in newspapers and on the Internet. His family, represented by his brothers, Keith and Robert, pleaded with the public and the press to let them mourn their loved one in peace.\n\nCarradine's funeral was held on June 13, 2009, in Los Angeles. His bamboo casket was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. Among the many stars and family members who attended his private memorial were Tom Selleck, Lucy Liu, Frances Fisher, James Cromwell, Steve Railsback, and Chris Potter. His grave was marked on December 3, 2009. The monument proclaimed him to be \"The Barefoot Legend\" and included a quote from \"Paint\", a song he wrote and performed as the theme to \"Sonny Boy\", as an epitaph.\n\nOn the first anniversary of his death, Carradine's widow, Annie, announced that she had filed a lawsuit for wrongful death against the company that produced the film Carradine was working on at the time of his death. The lawsuit claimed that the company failed to provide assistance to the actor that had been agreed upon in his contract. \"The suit alleges, the assistant left him behind for dinner on the night before the actor was found dead. The assistant and other film staffers apparently could not reach Carradine and decided to leave without him. Carradine called the assistant an hour later but was told the group was across town, and he would have to make his own arrangements that evening.\" Annie Carradine reached a settlement with MK2 Productions in August 2011. She was reported to be receiving about US$400,000 from the company for Carradine's death.\n\nIn June 2010, Marina Anderson, Carradine's fourth ex-wife, published \"David Carradine: The Eye of My Tornado\", a memoir that discusses intimate details of their marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43948817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43948817", "title": "Death of Jason Callahan", "text": "Death of Jason Callahan\n\nJason Patrick Callahan (April 18, 1976 – June 26, 1995), previously known as Grateful Doe and Jason Doe, was an American man killed in a car accident on June 26, 1995, in Emporia, Greensville County, Virginia. His body remained nameless until December 9, 2015. Earlier in 2015, photographs of an unknown male surfaced on a Facebook page for the John Doe. DNA testing later confirmed Callahan to be the unidentified man.\n\nCallahan was killed in a vehicle crash, along with the driver, Michael Hager, after the Vanagon in which they were riding crashed into a pair of trees on U.S. Route 58 West around 1:30 PM on June 26, 1995. Neither man was wearing a seat belt, which likely contributed to each of their deaths. Found with Callahan's body were two Grateful Dead tickets from Washington, D.C., which had been scalped, a dollar in quarters, and a yellow BIC lighter. A letter was found, depending on sources either in the John Doe's pocket or near the crash site, reading: \"Jason, Sorry we had to go, see ya around, call me #914-XXXX. Caroline T. & Caroline O. Bye!!!!\". The phone number on the letter lacked an area code and never led to any additional clues. The letter also contained a small drawing that some speculate may be of Jerry Garcia. The tickets were dated June 24, 1995, and June 25, 1995, respectively. Neither of the 'Carolines' have ever been identified.\n\nThe young man, estimated to be between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one years old, had brown eyes with long curly brown or dark blond hair that had been dyed a reddish color. There was a tattoo of a star on his upper-left arm and another possible tattoo, which was faded, on his right arm, both of which appeared to have been amateurishly executed. He was wearing a beaded necklace and his left ear had been pierced but he did not wear an earring. There was a scar found on his back. He was a Caucasian, had no apparent dental work as his third molars were visible. However, his teeth were fairly well cared for. At the time of the accident he was wearing a red, tie-dyed Grateful Dead T-shirt, Levi's jeans, white socks and black Fila running shoes.\n\nThe vehicle's driver was identified as Michael E. Hager, 21, who may have picked the John Doe up as a hitchhiker, and who authorities hypothesize may have fallen asleep at the wheel, as neither of the decedents had drugs or alcohol in their bodies. It has been suggested that Hager may have agreed to transport the John Doe because of their similar styles of dress, as they both appeared to be fans of The Grateful Dead. Authorities attempted to identify the John Doe through fingerprint analysis with the aid of national databases, but were unsuccessful.\n\nWhen interviewed, Hager's family could not identify the unknown passenger, who had been reported to have been riding in Hager's Volkswagen Vanagon when he stopped to give his father a letter in Williamsburg, Virginia. However, a detective from the area stated that this claim was not accurate, and that Hager was alone when he stopped to visit his father. It is speculated that the unidentified young man had actually been picked up between Fairfax and Gloucester, Virginia.\n\nDue to the severity of the lacerations on John Doe's face, mortuary photographs could not be released to the public, although a facial reconstruction was later released. In 2012, another facial reconstruction was created by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The man who had originally bought the tickets found in John Doe's pocket did not remember the person he had sold them to. At least 221 missing people were ruled out as possible identities of the victim.\n\nIn 2015, photographs surfaced of a young man wearing similar clothing to that worn by the John Doe and who bore a strong resemblance to the reconstruction images. The person in these photographs was named Jason and was described to have been a fan of Grateful Dead. He had not been heard from since 1995 and was known to have lived in both Illinois and South Carolina. It had not yet been verified whether this was indeed the John Doe as his former roommates and other friends did not recall Jason's last name.\nThe \"New York Post\" and BuzzFeed were some of the newspapers that covered the story.\n\nIn January 2015, law enforcement conducted a DNA test to see if the John Doe was the same man as Jason Patrick Callahan, the son of a 63-year-old woman who had not seen or heard from him since June 1995, when he left home to \"follow the Grateful Dead\". Callahan, who was identified as the young man in the photographs, is described as having been a white male with wavy blonde hair and brown eyes, standing between and tall, and weighing about . Callahan, if he was alive, would have been 38 at the time. Callahan was not reported missing by his mother until 2015.\n\nLt. Joey Crosby, spokesman for Myrtle Beach police, stated that Callahan's mother failed to file a report with police due to the nomadic nature of Grateful Dead fans. \"She attempted to report it when he went missing but didn’t know which jurisdiction to report it to,\" he said. Callahan's family also stated that they presumed he had gone to \"live on his own, elsewhere.\"\n\nAfter initial tests proved inconclusive, additional DNA testing confirmed that the body was indeed that of Jason Callahan.\n\n"}
{"id": "49532900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49532900", "title": "Death of Starr Faithfull", "text": "Death of Starr Faithfull\n\nStarr Faithfull (born Marian Starr Wyman, January 27, 1906 — c. June 6, 1931) was an American socialite notable for her mysterious drowning death at age 25 in 1931. After her death, a scandal resulted when newspapers published allegations that she had been sexually abused as a child by Andrew James Peters, a wealthy, prominent politician and former Mayor of Boston, and that he was suspected of murdering her. Investigators unsuccessfully attempted to determine whether her death was a homicide or a suicide. Her death remains unsolved.\n\nFaithfull was found dead on the beach at Long Beach, New York on the morning of June 8, 1931. An autopsy found that she died by drowning, but she also had many bruises apparently caused by beating or rough handling, and a large dose of a sedative in her system. Investigators initially thought her death was a homicide, and that she had either been pushed into deep water or forcibly held under shallow water. Her stepfather accused Peters of having her killed to prevent her from revealing the sexual abuse. However, the homicide theory was called into question by letters that Faithfull had written shortly before her death, expressing her intentions to commit suicide. A grand jury convened to hear evidence returned an open verdict, and the case was closed with no definitive conclusion as to whether her death was homicide, suicide, or an accident.\n\nFaithfull's death made national and international news due to its many sensational aspects, including her youth, beauty, promiscuity, and flapper lifestyle, as well as the allegations about Peters. The evidence included her diary containing explicit descriptions of her sexual liaisons with 19 different men, including one she called \"AJP\" who was thought to be Peters. \"Time\" magazine called the story a \"sexy death mystery\" with a \"perfect front-page name\". Her story has inspired several fictional works, the best known of which is John O'Hara's 1935 novel \"BUtterfield 8\". The case has also been discussed in a number of non-fiction books, including British crime historian Jonathan Goodman's 1990 true crime book \"The Passing of Starr Faithfull\", which won a Gold Dagger award.\n\nStarr Faithfull was descended from an impoverished branch of an old money Massachusetts family. Her wealthy relatives, including former Mayor of Boston Andrew J. Peters, provided financial assistance and frequent social invitations to her mother, her sister and herself. At age 20, Faithfull told her mother that Peters had been sexually abusing her for years, starting when she was only 11 years old. Her mother and stepfather, who had very little money, used the situation to force Peters to pay them large sums of money, part of which was used to send Faithfull on repeated cruises to Great Britain and other destinations. In her twenties, she adopted a party lifestyle including substance abuse and ill-fated affairs with men, who were often ship's officers she met during her cruise travels or at shipboard parties.\n\nStarr Faithfull was born Marian Starr Wyman (nicknamed \"Bamby\") on January 27, 1906 in Evanston, Illinois to Frank Wyman II, an investment banker, and his wife Helen MacGregor Pierce of Andover, Massachusetts. In 1907, the Wymans moved to Montclair, New Jersey. A second child, Elizabeth Tucker \"Sylvia\" Wyman, was born in 1911.\n\nHelen Wyman came from a wealthy, socially established family, although her father lost his fortune before she was married, leaving her relatively poor. Helen's cousin Martha had married Andrew J. Peters, a career politician who served as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Massachusetts Senate; a U.S. congressman from Massachusetts; an assistant secretary of the treasury under President Woodrow Wilson; and mayor of Boston from 1918 to 1922. Peters was known for his actions during the 1919 Boston Police Strike that raised Calvin Coolidge, then governor of Massachusetts, to national prominence, leading to Coolidge becoming vice president and later president of the United States]]. Peters was also a friend of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was governor of New York at the time of Starr Faithfull's 1931 death and later became president.\n\nHelen Wyman and her daughters frequently visited Helen's wealthy Massachusetts relatives, including Martha and Andrew Peters. The Peterses were among the relatives who helped support the Wymans by giving Helen gifts of money and paying for her daughters' private school educations. Starr Wyman spent summers with the Peterses and their children at their family home. Andrew Peters often took the young girl on trips alone with him, during which the two stayed in hotels.\n\nFrank and Helen Wyman divorced in 1924, and the following year Helen married Stanley Faithfull, with her daughters also taking his name. Stanley Faithfull, a widower who was previously married to the governess of Leverett Saltonstall, was a self-employed inventor and entrepreneur who failed at numerous business ventures and earned little or no money. He had a history of bringing lawsuits for money. The Faithfulls initially settled in West Orange, New Jersey, but lost their heavily mortgaged house to foreclosure and moved to an apartment at 12 St. Luke's Place, Greenwich Village, where they were still living at the time of Starr Faithfull's death in 1931. Jimmy Walker, who was then the mayor of New York City (from 1926 to 1932), lived a few houses away at 6 St. Luke's Place.\n\nDuring Starr Faithfull's teenage years, she began to show signs of emotional disturbance. She eventually received psychiatric treatment, including a short voluntary stay in the Channing Sanitarium, a mental hospital in Wellesley, Massachusetts. In June 1926, she told her mother that Peters had been sexually abusing her for years, beginning when she was 11. She said that Peters read her sex instructions written by Havelock Ellis and drugged her with ether before sexually abusing her. \n\nStanley Faithfull engaged an attorney and negotiated a 1927 written settlement agreement with Peters whereby Peters paid the Faithfulls $20,000 — supposedly to cover Starr Faithfull's medical care and rehabilitation — in return for keeping the abuse secret. Although the settlement document presented this as a one-time payment, the Faithfulls received several additional large payments from Peters, and may have been extorting money from him. The total amount paid by Peters to the Faithfulls has been estimated at around $80,000, with Peters' payments being the sole apparent source of income for the family. It was later discovered that Stanley and Helen Faithfull had contacted Peters and others close to him just before Starr Faithfull's disappearance and sent Peters a letter on June 7 while she was missing, asking Peters for more money.\n\nAccording to Goodman, the police evidence file indicated that by 1931, gangsters unrelated to the family had also learned about the abuse and had used the knowledge to extort money from Peters in Boston shortly before Starr Faithfull's death. Russel Crouse, who wrote an early true crime account of the case, also said that the investigators \"did come upon some evidence that someone other than the Faithfull family had heard the story and had attempted to make use of it in Boston.\"\n\nInvestigators learned after Starr Faithfull's death that her mother and stepfather, acting on doctors' advice, had paid artist Edwin Megargee to be her \"sex tutor\" and teach her how to have normal sexual relations after her traumatic experiences with Peters. Money received from Peters was also used to send her away on cruises to the Mediterranean, the West Indies and five or six times to Great Britain, where she stayed for extended periods in London. When not going on cruises, she regularly attended the bon voyage parties held on ocean liners in port before their departures from New York, and socialized with the ships' officers. At one point she claimed to be engaged to an officer, who denied it and left her stranded in London without funds. She regularly visited nightclubs and speakeasies, drank and used drugs, once nearly overdosing on sleeping pills in London. In March 1931, she was briefly committed to Bellevue Hospital after being found drunk, naked and beaten in a New York City hotel room; she had checked into the hotel with a man she had apparently just met as \"Joseph Collins and wife\".\n\nOn May 29, 1931, a few days before her death, she attended a party on the Cunard liner \"Franconia\" to see the ship's doctor, Dr. George Jameson-Carr. She had been infatuated with Carr for some time and considered him the love of her life, although he did not return her affections. After Carr made her leave his sitting room because the ship was departing, she remained on deck when the ship left the dock, despite having no ticket (which at that point she could not afford). Upon being discovered, she was forcibly removed from the ship and sent back to the pier on a tugboat, screaming \"Kill me! Throw me overboard!\" Newspapers and her friends later reported that she had attempted to stow away in order to be with Carr and return to London. However, in a letter to Carr, she said that she did not intend to stow away and had simply become too drunk to disembark, although this explanation may have been intended to protect Carr from getting into trouble with his employer Cunard over the incident.\n\nIn the days leading up to Starr Faithfull's disappearance and death, she kept a busy social schedule and was seen by numerous witnesses, including her friends and family as well as taxicab drivers and other strangers. Her family last saw her on the morning of Friday, June 5, 1931, leaving the house in the same dress she was wearing when found. Investigators discovered that after she left the house that day, she made multiple trips to ocean liners docked in Manhattan, where she visited ship's officers. After spending the evening with one of them, she got into a taxicab late on Friday night and seemingly vanished, only to be found dead on a Long Island beach the following Monday morning, June 8, 1931. \n\nAfter Starr Faithfull's death, a taxicab driver and other witnesses reported that on the afternoon of Thursday, June 4, 1931, an intoxicated woman that they later recognized as Faithfull was helped into a cab in front of the Chanin Building on 42nd Street in Manhattan. The taxi driver testified that she stopped to buy additional liquor during her ride and that he drove her to Flushing, Queens in search of a certain house, but she could not locate it, and exited his cab at a drugstore located at 33rd Avenue and 163rd Street.\n\nThe evening of June 4, she told her mother and sister that she attended a party given by publisher Bennett Cerf for actress Miriam Hopkins (whom she confused with actress Peggy Hopkins Joyce) in Cerf's office at 20 E. 57th Street in Manhattan. According to her mother, she mentioned seeing two friends of hers, actors named \"Bruce Winston\" and \"Jack Greenaway\" at the party, and said she would be meeting up with them the next night as well. However, another friend of Starr Faithfull, Dr. Charles Young Roberts, later said that she had actually spent the evening of June 4 with him at The Roosevelt Hotel, visiting a speakeasy and going for a taxi ride.\n\nStarr Faithfull's family reported seeing her for the last time leaving the family apartment on St. Luke's Place at 9:30 am on the morning of Friday, June 5, 1931, wearing an expensive silk dress, hat, gloves, shoes and stockings, and carrying a purse and coat. She had three dollars and was planning to have her hair waved. According to her family, she never came home.\n\nA newsstand vendor located near the 9th Street subway station in Greenwich Village, of whom Faithfull was a regular customer, said that he sold her a newspaper at 11:30 am. At 1 pm, taxicab driver Murray Edelman said that Faithfull, whom he recognized from the \"Franconia\" incident several days earlier, had gotten into his cab near the Chelsea Piers (from which the Cunard ships and other passenger liners departed) with a man in a Cunard uniform, whom she called \"Brucie\". She told the man she would see him on the wharf at 4 pm, but the man told her not to come back. Edelman said he drove her to her home at 12 St. Luke's Place, although he did not see her enter the house (and her family said she had not returned home), and then took the man back to the piers. Around 2 pm, Faithfull, having apparently returned to the Chelsea Piers and now appearing intoxicated, again was put into Edelman's waiting cab by the same man, who told Edelman to take her back to St. Luke's Place and not let her return to the piers again. However, she got out after a few blocks because she had only 10 cents, which was not sufficient for the fare. She had then walked back in the direction of the piers.\n\nA beauty shop employee in Grand Central Terminal said that a \"Miss Faithfull\" had visited the shop on June 5 between 2:30 and 3 pm and spoken to her about an appointment. A female acquaintance of Faithfull also reported seeing her at Grand Central around the same time. Later, she was seen on board the Cunard liner \"Mauretania\", but was also seen leaving the ship before its 5 pm departure for the Bahamas.\n\nCarr and Roberts later said that, after visiting the \"Mauretania\", she had visited another Cunard liner in port, the \"Carmania\", to which Roberts was then assigned. Roberts confirmed that on June 5 he entertained Starr Faithfull aboard the \"Carmania\" from about 5:30 pm until after 10 pm, including having a light meal at 8:30 pm. She had said she wanted to travel to Calcutta and Paris, where she said she had a woman friend who had willed her some money. Roberts said that shortly after 10 pm, he gave her a dollar for cab fare and put her into a cab near Pier 56, supposedly to drive her to another ocean liner, the \"Île de France\", on which she planned to attend a party. A police officer who recognized Faithfull from the \"Franconia\" incident saw her getting into the cab.\n\nPolice informants later told investigators that on Saturday, June 6, a woman fitting Starr Faithfull's description had been seen with a male companion at Tappe's Hotel in Island Park near Long Beach, and may have had an argument with her companion or have left with a group of other men. The hotel was a favorite rendezvous for New York City mobsters and bootleggers including Bill Dwyer, Vannie Higgins, and Dutch Schultz.\n\nAfter Starr Faithfull's family had failed to locate her by the evening of Saturday, June 6, her stepfather reported her missing to the NYPD Missing Persons Bureau. Stanley and Helen Faithfull also sent a letter to Peters on June 7 informing him that Starr Faithfull was missing and seeking money.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, June 8, 1931, around 6:30 am, Starr Faithfull's dead body was found by a beachcomber at Long Beach, Nassau County, New York, on the beach near Minnesota Avenue. When found, she was wearing only her dress, silk stockings, and a suspender girdle that held up the stockings, with no other underwear, and the rest of her outer clothing and accessories missing. Neither her dress nor her manicured nails were damaged, although her body showed a large number of bruises that the medical examiner said had been inflicted before death, apparently by another person. Her body was identified by her stepfather, Stanley Faithfull, on the evening of June 8.\n\nAn autopsy determined that she had died of drowning and that her body had been in the water for at least 48 hours, thus suggesting that she died on the night of Friday, June 5 or the early morning of Saturday, June 6. The time spent in the water and her estimated time of death would later be questioned by another expert who had been handling drowning cases in the Long Beach area for many years and believed that Faithfull had been in the water for less than 10 hours, meaning that she had died late on Sunday, June 7 or in the early morning of June 8, and probably drowned close to the beach where she was found. Her lungs contained a large quantity of sand, which was later interpreted as indicating that she drowned in shallow water near shore, rather than further out to sea. The autopsy further found that she had eaten a large meal of meat, potatoes, mushrooms and fruit three to four hours before her death, but had not drunk alcohol for 36 hours before her death. Her liver contained a high level of a drug initially identified as the barbiturate Veronal — a sedative that she frequently purchased and used — indicating that before her death she had taken a dose large enough to cause stupor or semi-stupor, but not large enough to kill her. A later letter from the toxicologist and other evidence suggested that she might have actually taken a similar but stronger drug such as Luminal or Allonal, which would have increased her stupor. The medical report initially said that she had been raped; a second report ruled out rape, but said she had sexual intercourse shortly before her death.\n\nStarr Faithfull's death was initially investigated as a homicide, until new evidence came to light suggesting that her death was a suicide or accident caused by her jumping or falling overboard from a ship. The Faithfulls insisted her death was a homicide and accused Peters of having her murdered, finally going so far as to publicly identify him by name to the media. In so doing, the Faithfulls came under suspicion themselves for not cooperating fully with investigators and for having a monetary motive to accuse Peters, whose money they had been living on for years. The case was finally closed with no conclusion being reached as to whether Starr Faithfull's death was a homicide, suicide or accident. Several true crime writers have offered their own alternative theories about her death. \n\nThe investigation into Starr Faithfull's death was led by Nassau County Police Inspector Harold King, Nassau County District Attorney (DA) Elvin Edwards, and Assistant DA Martin Littleton Jr. After identifying his stepdaughter's body, Stanley Faithfull told King and Littleton that he believed Andrew J. Peters had ordered her murder in order to prevent her from revealing her past sexual abuse by Peters. Faithfull also told the press that he believed his stepdaughter had been murdered, but initially did not give them Peters' name, although he did eventually tell them she had been \"corrupted\" as a child by an unnamed older, wealthy male friend of the family who had later paid a settlement. London artist Rudolph Haybrook, a close friend of Starr Faithfull, also was quoted in the press as saying she was murdered to prevent her from testifying in an upcoming $25,000 lawsuit.\n\nAlthough Inspector King thought the death was probably a suicide even after hearing Stanley Faithfull's story, DA Edwards was convinced that it was murder. At Edwards' direction, the investigators began to examine the death as a homicide, with Edwards traveling to Boston and announcing that he expected to indict two unnamed men in her death, one of whom he said \"played an important role in New York political circles\". At that time, Peters was helping to organize the first Presidential election campaign for his friend, New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt. Starr Faithfull's body was due to be cremated on June 11, but Edwards dramatically ordered the cremation stopped at the last minute so he could convene a grand jury to look into her death.\n\nA police search of the Faithfulls' apartment found Starr Faithfull's diary, despite Stanley Faithfull's claims that no diary existed and/or that it had been destroyed. Her diary, which she called her \"Memory Book\" or \"Mem Book\", contained explicit details of her affairs with 19 men identified by initials. Although much of the diary was considered too risque to print, some of its material was featured in newspapers. The initials \"AJP\" in some diary entries were thought to refer to Peters. When newspapers began to connect Peters to the case, he issued a statement via his lawyer denying that he had ever had \"improper relations\" with Starr Faithfull, and further stating that he had no evidence relating to her death and had not seen any member of the Faithfull family for five years. He was later formally questioned by investigators in the fall of 1931, but continued to deny any involvement.\n\nInitially, investigators thought Starr Faithfull had either been pushed from the \"Mauretania\" or abducted from that ship into a boat, from which she was then pushed into the water. Later, the large amount of sand found in her lungs coupled with the bruises to her upper body caused them to believe that she had been drowned in the sandy water close to shore by being forcibly held under water, perhaps near the spot where she was found, rather than having been pushed from a ship several miles offshore and having her body wash up on shore. They gathered information from the Coast Guard about the tides and currents near Long Beach in an effort to determine how Faithfull's body might have arrived on the beach, but results of this query were never published.\n\nThe man named \"Brucie\" mentioned by the cab driver was first thought to be the actor \"Bruce Winston\" that Starr Faithfull had said she met at Cerf's party. Attempts to locate the \"Bruce Winston\" and \"Jack Greenaway\" supposedly mentioned by Faithfull proved fruitless; an elderly British actor named Bruce Winston was found, but he had not been in the United States since February and had spent the past several weeks appearing in a play in London. Investigators then sought a Chicago gangster named Ernest Blue, alias Richard Bruce. An acquaintance of Starr Faithfull named David \"Bruce\" Blue was finally located in London, who said he had been with her on the \"Mauretania\" on June 5.\n\nEfforts were made to locate the taxicab driver who picked up Starr Faithfull near Pier 56 after 10 pm on June 5. Despite substantial reward money being offered for information about Faithfull's route and destination that night, no cab driver ever came forward, causing speculation about whether Faithfull was actually abducted by a cab driver, or by someone else posing as a cab driver, possibly under the control of mobsters.\n\nAlthough Edwards and Littleton continued to investigate the death as a possible homicide until December 1931, including questioning Peters, they were unable to gather sufficient evidence to obtain indictments or otherwise prove the homicide theory.\n\nWhile investigators were pursuing the homicide theory, Dr. Carr, having arrived in London on the \"Franconia\", received three letters that Starr Faithfull had written him on May 30, June 2, and June 4, 1931. Carr personally hand-carried the letters back to the United States and provided them to the investigators around June 23, also being interviewed by police at that time. \"The New York Times\" published the full text of the letters on June 22 and June 24.\n\nIn the first letter, dated May 30, Faithfull wrote, However, the letter ended by asking if Carr would come and see her when he was next in New York, causing some to question Faithfull's true intentions. The second letter apologized for the May 29 incident aboard the \"Franconia\" in New York.\n\nIn the third letter, written the day before she disappeared, Faithfull expressed in detail her intent and plans to commit suicide because she could not cope with her unrequited love for Carr. The letter began, The letter went on to talk about how she would carry out her suicide, with \"[n]o ether, no allonal, or window jumping\", and how she would spend her last hours, including having \"one delicious meal\", hearing some \"good music\", drinking \"slowly, keeping aware every second\", enjoying a \"last cigarette\", and \"encourag[ing]\" men who flirted with her on the street — \"I don't care who they are\". She wrote, \"It's a great life when one has twenty-four hours to live.\" (An earlier Associated Press story that ran before Carr delivered the letters said that one letter contained the statement, \"When you receive this I will be dead\"; according to a later \"New York Daily News\" account, the statement was, \"When you receive this letter, I will have committed suicide by drowning.\" However, this statement is not contained in any of the letters published in \"The New York Times\" in June 1931.)\n\nThe letters raised the possibility that Faithfull had committed suicide by stowing away aboard one of the ships in port in New York on June 5 until the ship was underway, and then, after taking a large dose of sedative, jumping overboard as the ship passed south of Long Beach late on June 5 or early on June 6, with her body eventually washing up on shore. Alternatively, it was thought that she might have stowed away and then accidentally fallen overboard while under the influence of the sedative. Following disclosure of the letters, many people, including Police Inspector King (who had taken the position early in the investigation that the death was likely suicide or an accident) thought that Starr Faithfull had committed suicide. \"The New York Times\" printed that the letters \"seemed to remove all doubt that the girl...ended her own life.\"\n\nStanley Faithfull continued to insist that his stepdaughter had been murdered, contending that the letters were forgeries and presenting his own handwriting expert to the grand jury in an attempt to disprove the Nassau County expert's findings that the letters were genuine. Edwards and Littleton also still believed that Starr Faithfull had been murdered, and continued their investigation for several more months. Edwards thought that she would not have been capable of suicide while under the influence of so much Veronal.\n\nLittleton eventually came to believe the suicide theory after interviewing Dr. Roberts in December 1931, near the end of the investigation. Based on Roberts' information about spending the evening with Starr Faithfull on the \"Carmania\" and then putting her into a cab to go to a party on the \"Île de France\", Littleton concluded that she probably stowed away on the \"Île de France\" and then jumped overboard after it sailed. Littleton did issue a denial in \"The New York Times\" of an International News Service story claiming that he had located a witness who actually saw Starr Faithfull jump from a ship.\n\nHowever, the suicide explanation has been questioned by later crime analysts. American true crime author Jay Robert Nash stated in his 1983 book \"Open Files: A Narrative Encyclopedia of the World's Greatest Unsolved Crimes\" that there was no evidence of Starr Faithfull ever having been aboard the \"Île de France\", and little evidence that she had actually committed suicide, compared to more evidence that her death had been homicide. Goodman in his 1990 book \"The Passing of Starr Faithfull\" stated that she could not have gone aboard the \"Île de France\" because it actually sailed at 10 pm while she was still visiting Dr. Roberts, and that it was docked close to the \"Carmania\" so she would not have taken a cab. Goodman also concluded that she did not go overboard from any of the other ships leaving on June 5 or June 6 because, among other things, she would not have had time or inclination to consume her last large meal of meat, vegetables and fruit so soon after eating a light meal of different food with Roberts; her conversation with Roberts indicated that she did not have any barbiturates or any money to obtain them on June 5; she had been seen intoxicated on both June 4 and June 5, contrary to the autopsy which found she had consumed no alcohol for 36 hours before death, suggesting that she did not die until June 7 or early on June 8; and her silk dress and silk stockings were not damaged as would be expected from spending 48 hours in the water, during a time when a storm was affecting the area.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, Edwards and Littleton became suspicious of Stanley, Helen and Tucker Faithfull, and thought they were withholding information, being less than cooperative, and may even have been involved in Starr Faithfull's murder. Newspapers also reported on the family's apparent need for money and lack of visible means of support.\n\nAfter the evidence of Starr Faithfull's possible suicide came to light in late June 1931, the grand jury proceedings were closed, with no indictments issued, and the case began to fade from the headlines. Stanley Faithfull, anxious to keep the press interested in the story, continued to state that his stepdaughter was murdered by hired killers acting on behalf of a high-profile person. In July 1931, he alleged \"shameful official negligence\" on the part of the Nassau County investigators and further alleged that DA Edwards had been intimidated by persons \"too big and influential for him to tackle\". Edwards strongly denied that he had been intimidated, and said that he believed Starr Faithfull had been murdered, but did not have the evidence to prove it. He further said, \"Neither Peters nor anybody else is so highly placed that I won't proceed against them.\"\nOn July 25, Stanley Faithfull for the first time publicly named Andrew J. Peters as the man alleged to have had an improper relationship with the 11-year-old Starr Faithfull, and also disclosed the original 1927 settlement agreement between the Faithfulls and Peters releasing Peters from liability for Starr's abuse, and Peters' settlement check for $20,000. As a result of being publicly connected with the case, Peters suffered several nervous breakdowns.\n\nIn late July and early August, the grand jury probe was reopened to consider evidence provided by Stanley Faithfull that the suicide letters to Carr were forgeries not written by Starr Faithfull. In early August, New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt also reviewed the case to determine whether the death had been properly investigated by the Nassau County authorities.\n\nThe New York \"Daily News\", which had been conducting its own investigation, then confirmed that the Faithfulls were in debt and in dire need of money, and that Stanley Faithfull had traveled to Boston shortly before Starr Faithfull's disappearance to seek additional payoffs from Peters. Stanley Faithfull responded by suing the \"Daily News\" publisher, the reporter who wrote the stories, and several other papers for libel, but his claims were ultimately dismissed.\n\nBy October 1931, the Starr Faithfull case was reported to be \"virtually closed\", although Roberts' statements about being with her on the \"Carmania\" were not obtained until the planned last days of the investigation in early December. Later in December, a final inquest was held into her death. It lasted only 15 minutes, and reached no conclusion. Nassau County Coroner Edward Neu was quoted as saying, \"Whatever I decide, it will only be a matter of opinion.\"\n\nGoodman theorized that Faithfull was killed by Long Island mobster Vannie Higgins and his associates. According to Goodman's research, Higgins had learned that the Faithfulls were extorting money from Peters due to his past improper sexual relationship with Starr Faithfull. Based on this information, Goodman suggested that Higgins, wishing to blackmail Peters or extort more money from him, had Faithfull kidnapped and driven to Island Park, where he provided her with a meal and barbiturates and questioned her in an effort to get more information that he could use against Peters. Unsatisfied with her answers, he beat her, causing the many bruises on her body. When she appeared to have died from the beating, he ordered her body dumped into the ocean near Long Beach. However, she was still alive when she entered the water, and died by drowning.\n\nNash and reporter Morris Markey, who covered the case in 1931 for \"The New Yorker\" magazine, both theorized that based on the evidence and Faithfull's past behavior, including the hotel incident that resulted in her being taken to Bellevue Hospital, she had likely been killed on the beach at Long Beach by an unknown man after a sexual encounter had gone wrong. According to this theory, Faithfull went to the beach with a man she had picked up, ostensibly to have sexual relations. Once there, she removed most of her clothing, but then teased or refused sex until the man became enraged, beat her, and drowned her in the shallow water and sand near the shoreline, possibly after sexually assaulting her. Goodman also wrote that this theory was supported by some facts.\n\nPeters was never prosecuted for any crime in connection with Starr Faithfull's death. Although his personal reputation was harmed by the scandal, he still maintained some political status. He served as treasurer of a Massachusetts state campaign against money-hoarding organized at the request of President Herbert Hoover in 1932, and was named to the Massachusetts Advisory Committee of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation in 1933. He died in 1938.\n\nStarr Faithfull's 19-year-old sister Tucker (aka Sylvia) Faithfull was quoted after Starr's death as saying, \"I'm not sorry Starr's dead. She's happier. Everyone is happier.\" According to Tucker Faithfull, her sister had dominated the family, even to the point of deciding where they would live, and physically slapped and pinched other family members if she did not get her own way. Tucker Faithfull later changed her name back to Wyman before marrying. Newspaper columnist Dorothy Kilgallen reported Stanley Faithfull's death in 1949.\n\nA 1946 Associated Press story on the death of former District Attorney Edwards discussed the Starr Faithfull case as one of two high-profile unsolved cases handled by Edwards. Edwards' records on the case were later said to have vanished. The police file survived and was reviewed by Jonathan Goodman in writing his 1990 book about the case.\n\nAccording to John O'Hara biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli, O'Hara had Starr Faithfull's diary in his possession for some time and used it as research material in writing his 1935 novel \"BUtterfield 8\". Some sources have written that police lost or destroyed the diary after the case was closed. A 2002 \"Baltimore Sun\" article said that the diary may have eventually been given to Peters, who locked it in a box hidden in the library paneling of his Boston home, where it was later found by the new owners of the house, but its whereabouts as of 2002 were unknown.\n\nStarr Faithfull's life and death inspired several fictional novels, most notably John O'Hara's \"BUtterfield 8\". She has also been discussed in a number of non-fiction books and anthologies, as well as some other works. \nSeveral novels have been based on Starr Faithfull's story. The first and best known is John O'Hara's second novel, \"BUtterfield 8\" (Harcourt, Brace, 1935). O'Hara's fictional protagonist Gloria Wandrous was based on Faithfull, whose diary O'Hara had read and whom he had seen in New York City speakeasies when she was alive, although he did not know her well. Contemporary readers recognized that the book was based on the Starr Faithfull case.\n\nIn the novel, Gloria is molested as a child by a prominent older man, becomes a heavy-drinking call girl, and dies by being swept under the paddlewheel of a boat. O'Hara later wrote that \"[t]he story of Gloria Wandrous had appeared as fact in the newspapers, along with her excerpted diary that could not all be printed either in a newspaper or a novel. If anything, I toned the story down[.]\" However, Sandra Scoppettone, who wrote a later novel about Faithfull, quoted the Faithfulls' landlady as saying that O'Hara visited her to research his novel, \"asked a lot of questions\" and \"wrote a book, but he got it all wrong.\"\n\n\"BUtterfield 8\" sold well when first published, and was later adapted into a 1960 film starring Elizabeth Taylor, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. O'Hara was not involved in writing the film adaptation, which bore little resemblance to his novel and ended with Gloria's death in an automobile accident, rather than a suicide or homicide by drowning.\n\nOther works of fiction based on Starr Faithfull's life and death are listed below.\n\n\nA non-fiction essay, \"The Mysterious Death of Starr Faithfull\", was written by Morris Markey, who covered the story and interviewed the Faithfull family in 1931 as the original \"reporter at large\" for \"The New Yorker\" magazine. The essay was included in the collection \"The Aspirin Age\" (ed. Isabel Leighton, Simon and Schuster, 1949), a selection of pieces about the essential events of American life in the years between World War I and World War II.\n\nTwo non-fiction true crime books have been written about the Starr Faithfull case. The first, \"The Girl on the Lonely Beach\" by Fred J. Cook (Red Seal Books, 1956) discusses her family background, based on newspaper reports, court transcripts and Cook's own interviews.\n\nThe second, \"The Passing of Starr Faithfull\" by Jonathan Goodman (Piatkus, 1990), also included material from the original police files and the remaining fragments of Faithfull's diary. Reviewer Paul Nigol of the University of Calgary called \"The Passing of Starr Faithfull\" \"the most complete account\" of the case because Goodman was the only author to have been granted full access to the police dossier. Goodman won the 1990 Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger Award for Non-Fiction for his book.\n\nStarr Faithfull's case has also been frequently discussed in social histories focusing on New York City or Boston, as well as true crime anthologies. The following is a selective list of books containing substantial discussions of the case.\n\n\nStarr Faithfull's unsolved death was the subject of a 1993 episode of the Granada Television true crime series \"In Suspicious Circumstances\", entitled \"Falling Starr\" (Season 3, Episode 5).\n\nLinda Ann Loschiavo's 2004 play \"Courting Mae West\", about actress Mae West's 1927 trial on morals charges in New York City, includes a character named \"Sara Starr\" who is based on Starr Faithfull.\n"}
{"id": "189018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189018", "title": "Elbow Room (book)", "text": "Elbow Room (book)\n\nElbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting is a 1984 book by the American philosopher Daniel Dennett, in which Dennett discusses the philosophical issues of free will and determinism.\n\nIn 1983, Dennett delivered the John Locke Lectures at Oxford on the topic of free will. In 1984, these ideas were published in the book \"Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting\". In this book Daniel Dennett explored what it means for people to have free will. The title, \"Elbow Room\", is a reference to the question: are we deterministic machines with no real freedom of action or do we in fact have some elbow room, some real choice in our behavior?\n\nA major task taken on by Dennett in \"Elbow Room\" is to clearly describe just what people are as biological entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance. In discussing what people are and why free will matters to us, Dennett makes use of an evolutionary perspective. Dennett describes the mechanical behavior of the digger wasp \"Sphex\". This insect follows a series of genetically programmed steps in preparing for egg laying. If an experimenter interrupts one of these steps the wasp will repeat that step again. For an animal like a wasp, this process of repeating the same behavior can go on indefinitely, the wasp never seeming to notice what is going on. This is the type of mindless, pre-determined behavior that humans can avoid. Given the chance to repeat some futile behavior endlessly, people can notice the futility of it, and by an act of free will do something else. We can take this as an operational definition of what people mean by free will. Dennett points out the fact that as long as people see themselves as able to avoid futility, most people have seen enough of the free will issue. Dennett then invites all who are satisfied with this level of analysis to get on with living while he proceeds into the deeper hair-splitting aspects of the free will issue.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, what is the difference between the wasp and a person? The person can, through interaction with his/her environment, construct an internal mental model of the situation and figure out a successful behavioral strategy. The wasp, with a much smaller brain and different genetic program, does not learn from its environment and instead is trapped in an endless and futile behavioral loop that is strictly determined by its genetic program. It is in this sense of people as animals with complex brains that can model reality and appear to choose among several possible behaviors that Dennett says we have free will.\n\nThe deeper philosophical issue of free will can be framed as a paradox. On one hand, we all feel like we have free will, a multitude of behavioral choices to select among. On the other hand, modern biology generally investigates humans as though the processes at work in them follow the same biological principles as those in wasps. How do we reconcile our feeling of free will with the idea that we might be mechanical components of a mechanical universe?\n\nWhat about determinism? When we say that a person chooses among several possible behaviors is there really a choice or does it just seem like there is a choice? Do people just (through the action of their more complex brains) simply have better behaviors than wasps, while still being totally mechanical in executing those behaviors? Dennett gives his definition of determinism on page one: \"All physical events are caused or determined by the sum total of all previous events\". This definition dodges a question that many people feel should not be dodged: if we repeatedly replayed the universe from the same point in time would it always reach the same future? Since we have no way of performing this experiment, this question is a long-term classic in philosophy and physicists have tried to interpret the results of other experiments in various ways in order to figure out the answer to this question. Modern day physics-oriented philosophers have sometimes tried to answer the question of free will using the many-worlds interpretation, according to which every time there is quantum indeterminacy each possibility occurs and new universes branch off. Since the 1920s, physicists have been trying to convince themselves that quantum indeterminacy can in some way explain free will. Dennett suggests that this idea is silly. How, he asks, can random resolutions of quantum-level events provide people with any control over their behavior?\n\nSince Dennett wrote \"Elbow Room\" (1984) there has been an ongoing attempt by some scientists to answer this question by suggesting that the brain is a device for controlling quantum indeterminacy so as to construct behavioral choice. Dennett argues that such efforts to salvage free will by finding a way out of the prison of determinism are wasted. \n\nDennett discusses many types of free will (1984). Many philosophers have claimed that determinism and free will are incompatible. What the physicists seem to be trying to construct is a type of free will that involves a way for brains to make use of quantum indeterminacy so as to make choices that alter the universe in our favor, or if there are multiple universes, to choose among the possible universes. Dennett suggests that we can have another kind of free will, a type of free will which we can be perfectly happy with even if it does not give us the power to act in more than one way at any given time. Dennett is able to accept determinism and free will at the same time. How so?\n\nThe type of free will that Dennett thinks we have is finally stated clearly in the last chapter of the book: the power to be active agents, biological devices that respond to our environment with rational, desirable courses of action. Dennett has slowly, through the course of the book, stripped the idea of behavioral choice from his idea of free will. How can we have free will if we do not have indeterministic choice? Dennett emphasizes control over libertarian choice. If our hypothetically mechanical brains are in control of our behavior and our brains produce good behaviors for us, then do we really need such choice? Is an illusion of behavioral choices just as good as actual choices? Is our sensation of having the freedom to execute more than one behavior at a given time really just an illusion? Dennett argues that choice exists in a general sense: that because we base our decisions on context, we limit our options as the situation becomes more specific. In the most specific circumstance (actual events), he suggests there is only one option left to us.\n\nIf people are determined to act as they do, then what about personal responsibility? How can we hold people responsible and punish them for their behaviors if they have no choice in how they behave? Dennett gives a two-part answer to this question:\n\nFirst, we hold people responsible for their actions because we know from historical experience that this is an effective means to make people behave in a socially acceptable way. Second, holding people responsible only works when combined with the fact that people can be informed of the fact that they are being held responsible and respond to this state of affairs by controlling their behavior so as to avoid punishment. People who break the rules set by society and get punished may be behaving in the only way they can, but if we did not hold them accountable for their actions, people would behave even worse than they do with the threat of punishment. This is a totally utilitarian approach to the issue of responsibility. Expressing moral indignation when people break the rules of proper behaviour is only useful to the extent that it contributes to dissuading such behaviour. Again, an argument from utility. Is it, then, moral to punish people who are unable to do other than break a rule? Yes, people have the right to come together and improve their condition by creating rules and enforcing them. We would be worse off if we did not do so. Again, an argument from utility.\n\nOne final issue: if people do not have real behavioral choices, why not collapse into fatalism? Again, Dennett's argument is that we may not have behavioral choice, but we do have control of our behavior. Dennett asks us to look around at the universe and ask, can I even conceive of beings whose will is freer than our own? For Dennett, the answer to this question is, no, not really. In \"Elbow Room\", he tries to explain why all the attempts that people have tried to make to prove that people have libertarian choice have failed and are, in the final analysis, not really important anyhow. As humans, we are as much in control of our behavior as anything in the universe. As humans, we have the best chance to produce good behavior. We should be satisfied with what we have and not fret over our lack of libertarian free will.\n\nSome complaints about \"Elbow Room\" relate to our intuitions about free will. Some say that Dennett's theory does not satisfactorily deal with the issue of why we feel so strongly that we do have behavioral choice. One answer to this question is the result of selection on individuals to live harmoniously in society. But one doesn't have to be free to achieve that goal. Another answer is that it tells us (our brains) whether we're doing something or someone else is doing something to us (e.g. shaking arm). But, again one does not have to be free to make such a distinction. A final answer to this question is that our sensation of having behavioral choice has been carefully selected by evolution. The well-developed human sensation of having free will and being able to select among possible behaviors has strong survival value. People who lose the feeling that they can plan alternative behaviors and execute their choice of possible behaviors tend to become fatalistic and stop struggling for survival. According to Dennett, belief in free will is a necessary condition for having free will. When we are planning for the future and thinking about possible actions to take in the future, we are utilizing considerable amounts of biologically expensive resources (brain power). Evolution has designed us to feel strongly that all of our effort of planning pays off, that we control what we do. If this connection between our brains' efforts to model reality and predict the future and so make possible good outcomes is disconnected from our sense of self and our will, then fatalism and self-destructive behaviors are close at hand. However, the same effect is attainted if, despite not believing in the control free will gives, we believe that does not prevent us to live as fully as our bodies allow us to and to try harder to achieve things if we think we have agency.\n\n"}

He served in the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment on the frontier in Wisconsin and Maine. In 1838 he transferred to the 8th Infantry Regiment and served on the Canada–US border.\n\nIn 1844, he fought in Florida against the Seminoles where he was appointed brevet major for meritorious service.\n\nDuring the Mexican–American War, he served with the 8th Infantry at Vera Cruz and at the Battle of Molino del Rey, where he was wounded. For this service he was appointed a brevet colonel.\n\nIn 1848 he was promoted to major, and then lieutenant colonel in 1855, when he transferred to the 4th Infantry Regiment and served on the West Coast. Later in 1855 he was promoted to colonel and sent to Fort Monroe, Virginia to recruit the 9th Infantry Regiment, which, when at strength, was sent to the Washington Territory.\n\nIn 1858 Wright oversaw the reconstruction of Fort Dalles in Oregon Territory from a wood outpost to a more substantial base while in command. He fought in the Yakima War in 1855–56. In 1858, in retaliation for the Steptoe Battle, he soundly defeated the combined tribes in the Battle of Four Lakes and the Battle of Spokane Plains near Spokane. On September 23, 1858, after signing agreements with the Coeur d'Alenes, Wright was in camp near Latah (Hangman's) Creek, near present-day Spokane, Washington. He had in custody Chief Owhi, regarded as a perpetrator of the attacks on white settlers which led to the Yakima War. Wright sent for Owhi's son, Qualchan, also considered a perpetrator, threatening to hang Owhi unless Qualchan came to the camp. When Qualchan rode in the next day, he was taken into custody and hung within 15 minutes. Wright issued the orders to hang him, telling Captain James Allen Hardie to carry out the duty.\n\nAt the beginning of the Civil War, Wright was the commanding officer of the Department of Oregon. Then, for a few months in 1861, he was the commanding officer of the District of Southern California. In October 1861, he was promoted to brigadier general of Volunteers and placed in command of the Department of the Pacific, replacing Edwin Vose Sumner, on Sumner's recommendation.\n\nAlthough Wright would have preferred to have been sent East during the Civil War, he remained in California where he commanded the largest force ever in the Far West—6,000 troops in 1862. His duties included protecting the frontier, keeping watch on secessionists, safeguarding the coast, and moving troops eastward.\n\nThe climate of San Francisco was not agreeable to Wright, because of his asthma, and he wanted to move the headquarters to Sacramento. The headquarters did not move, although Wright did spend time in Sacramento.\n\nWhen the regular army reorganized in 1865 and created the Military Division of the Pacific, Wright commanded the District of California for a few months until he was given command of the newly created Department of the Columbia. He may have been removed from command of the Department of the Pacific in order for the Army to have a position for Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell.\n\nWright and his wife died at sea \"en route\" to his new command when the steamer \"Brother Jonathan\" was wrecked off the California coast. His body was recovered six weeks later. He is interred in the Sacramento Historic City Cemetery.\n\nFor his service as commander of the Department of the Pacific, he was appointed a brevet brigadier general in the regular army.\n\nFort George Wright, located near Spokane, was named in his honor.\n\nIn 1827, Wright married Margaret Wallace Foster (or Forster). They were the parents of three sons and one daughter—Thomas Foster (or Forster), James Heron, Roswell, and Elizabeth H., the wife of Army Captain P. A. Owen.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2093847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2093847", "title": "Henry Bendix", "text": "Henry Bendix\n\nHenry Bendix, also known as Weatherman, is a fictional character in the Wildstorm universe. He first appeared in the \"Stormwatch\" series.\n\nHenry Bendix's past remains fairly muddled, partly because of the existence of an alternate Bendix who has been known to pose as the original. He grew up in Maladyville, Mississippi, raised by his abusive, alcoholic father. It appears that his father more than once killed a girlfriend during a drunken rage. Even as a child, Henry was extremely intelligent, designing the bodily enhancements that eventually led to the creation of the superheroes Midnighter and Apollo while still a child. Henry's diary from this time would mention that he had been contacted by the alien Weavers, who showed him the future. Young Henry was shocked to find out that he would become a villain, but the Weavers told him that till then he could be a hero. Henry killed his father with a self-built energy weapon in order to save his father's girlfriend, Delia. (See notes, as this origin was told in the Monarchy series.)\n\nDuring the 1960s, he worked for the US government, developing a mobile weapon that was operated through a combination of manual controls and cybernetic uplink. It was dubbed \"Think Tank\". He was recruited into Team One, a secret task force designed to deal with the emerging Daemonite threat. Team One was dissolved following its first mission. The actual tank was destroyed by Daemonites, causing energy to surge into Bendix's brain. The experience gave Bendix a lifelong interest in Earth's secret history. This fascination put him in contact with the villains known as the Four, and led him to discover the interdimensional realm known as the Bleed, among other things. Although he continued to work for the US government, he kept most of his funding for himself.\n\nIn 1978, he was appointed to the post of Weatherman One, head of StormWatch, the United Nations Special Crisis Intervention Team. During that time, he was outfitted with cybernetic implants that granted him direct cybernetic link to Skywatch's operating systems. He retained this post until 1994, when he was temporarily replaced by Christine Trelane. He regained his post a year later following the Second Despot Incident. All the while, he continued to explore the world and advance his own, secret agenda.\n\nThe Fire From Heaven incident inspired him to take a more proactive approach to peacekeeping. He reorganizes StormWatch, firing most of the junior members, recruiting Jenny Sparks, Rose Tattoo and Jack Hawksmoor and placing all members of the original team into inactive duties. He split the remaining memberships into three teams: StormWatch Prime, StormWatch Red and StormWatch Black. Bendix believed that this structure would allow for a more flexible response to post-human threats.\n\nWeatherman and his team attended a superhero 'conference' only to learn the earth was splitting up into separate realities. Most just the same, but with far less superheroes. Despite visible evidence of friends forgetting others had existed a moment ago, Bendix expressed pleasure at the idea of having less super-powered competition.\n\nShortly after StormWatch's reorganization, Bendix was approached by an alternate universe version of him. He offered Bendix a chance to explore the Bleed. In exchange, he asked Bendix to allow him to replace him. This alternate Bendix attempted to shape an orderly world and was killed by Jenny Sparks after he slaughtered members of a superhero team that was attempting to create a crime-free utopia. At the time members of Stormwatch believed this to be the real Bendix gone insane. The new Weatherman Jackson King even believed Bendix' madness was a result of the cybernetic implants (which were part of the Weatherman's job), and refused to have them himself.\n\nAfter exploring the Bleed and gathering allies, Bendix returned to his world in 2004. Discovering that the Authority was now in charge of America, he devised a plan to remove them from power whilst, at the same time, breaking up the team. His plan was successful. Following that, he assumed control of the shattered Secret Monarchy, the loose coalition of secret groups that run the world behind the scenes. He implemented an active post-human advancement agenda, facilitating integration of Kherubim and other otherworldly technology into American (and to a lesser extent, global) society. In 2008, he faced off against the reorganized Authority. After a prolonged struggle, he was killed by Midnighter.\n\nIn \"Stormwatch PHD\" #8, it is revealed that Bendix has a son named William. The spitting image of his father, the younger Bendix is the child of a call girl that Henry paid off to raise on her own in secret. William was recruited by Jackson King to be the new Weatherman (no longer a leadership role) for the reconstituted Stormwatch Prime. This is due to most of the cybernetic integration systems having been designed for Henry's physiology, so William is a wise choice. William is deeply concerned that he will turn into his father despite King's faith that he is his own man.\n\nWilliam's main goal has been to crack his father's \"memory tower,\" containing his most secret files. He manages to do this in \"\" miniseries, uncovering a secret bunker in the Nevada desert and leading to a battle between The Authority and Stormwatch Prime for custody of its contents. During the battle, an AI copy of Henry Bendix activates in response and proceeds to release zombie-like clones of his secret Stormwatch team (including copies of Apollo and Midnighter), seduce Rose Tattoo to his side yet again and install itself in a younger cloned body which has been engineered with the powers and abilities of every superhuman present. William arrives at the scene and convinces Rose to kill the clone of his father but not before he is seriously wounded by the reborn Henry Bendix. Although his body is not found by either of the teams after the resulting destruction of the bunker; the horrifically scarred William emerges from the wreckage, his father having psychically grafted his own consciousness onto William's mind. In control of his son's body, Bendix muses that the body is young and strong enough.\n\nHe's seen trying to kill Midnighter and Apollo, hiring the Lords of the Gun and giving them the Ace of Winchester. However, he is found by Midnighter and is killed.\n\nFirst appearing in The Wild Storm #2 after chastising Christine Trelane, the director of the Division(Skywatch's earth agents) before being fully introduced in issue four, Bendix is mainly unchanged from his original counterpart, still being the Weatherman of Skywatch. However, it is revealed that he is a more laid back version of his character behind the scenes, drinking and doing drugs. He is also revealed to be a racist and homophobic person, being especially crude toward the director of Internal Operations, Miles Craven, and his boyfriend Julian. It is even alluded to that during a summit, he left via teleport after staring at Julian \"like he wanted to watch [him] hang from a tree that was also on fire.\" Bendix also bears a deep hatred for Earth, preferring to be on the Skywatch station, even wanting an excuse to take over the planet so he wouldn't have to go there.\n\nThe alternate Bendix who replaced the original has had a substantial impact on the team as well, though in a much more negative way. Whilst the first Bendix had an undoubtedly ruthless and cold-hearted side, the new one was an entirely self-centred, psychotic individual pursuing an ultra-conservative agenda. He had a bizarre romantic affair with Rose Tattoo, the Spirit of Murder, apparently being attracted to her lust for death and destruction (when a later, evolved Tattoo asked the original why her poisoned kiss did not affect him, he replied \"Because I embrace it.\"). It was alternate Bendix who was defeated after attacking a group of superhumans attempting to establish a utopia in South America. He was killed by Jenny Sparks.\n\nIn the \"Monarchy\" series, Henry Bendix appears, claiming to have planned his death by Jenny Sparks so that he could become an \"imaginary being\", capable of assisting the Weavers and the Monarchy in their battle against Chimaera. Jackson King visits Bendix' home and finds his childhood diary there. In it Bendix relates the events of his first contact with the Weavers. The \"Authority: Revolution\" series seems to have retconned these events away. Therefore it is also unclear whether his youth in Maladyville, Mississippi is still part of continuity.\n"}
{"id": "950059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=950059", "title": "James Kim", "text": "James Kim\n\nJames Kim (August 9, 1971December 4, 2006) was an American television personality and technology analyst for the former TechTV international cable television network, reviewing products for shows including \"The Screen Savers\", \"Call for Help\", and \"Fresh Gear\". At the time of his death he was working as a senior editor of MP3 and Digital Audio for CNET, where he wrote more than 400 product reviews. He also co-hosted a weekly video podcast for CNET's gadget blog, Crave, and a weekly audio podcast, The MP3 Insider (both podcasts were co-hosted with Veronica Belmont).\n\nHis disappearance and death, and his family's ordeal, made them the subject of a brief but intense period of news coverage in December 2006.\n\nKim graduated from Ballard High School in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1989 and from Oberlin College in Ohio in 1993 where he double-majored in Government and English and played for the varsity lacrosse team. Son of Spencer H. Kim, an aerospace company executive and internationalist, Kim and his wife, Kati, owned two retail stores in San Francisco.\n\nKim was most widely known as a television personality on the international cable network TechTV, where he was a senior technology analyst for TechTV Labs. He made frequent appearances testing new products for shows including \"The Screen Savers\", \"Call for Help\", \"Fresh Gear\", and \"AudioFile\". He was best known for his \"Lab Rats\" segments, in which he reviewed the latest electronic gadgets. After leaving TechTV, he became a senior editor for CNET, a technology trade journal, which he had joined in 2004. He wrote product reviews and co-hosted a weekly podcast for CNET's gadget blog, Crave. Prior to working for TechTV, Kim had been a legal assistant at law firms in New York and France; a media relations assistant for baseball's American League; and a script reader for Miramax Films.\n\nAfter spending the 2006 Thanksgiving holiday in Seattle, Washington, the Kims (James, Kati, and their two daughters, 4-year old Penelope and 7-month old Sabine) set out for their home in San Francisco, California. On Saturday, November 25, 2006, having left Portland, Oregon, on their way to Tu Tu Tun Lodge, a resort located near Gold Beach, Oregon, the Kims apparently missed a turnoff from Interstate 5 to Oregon Route 42, a main route to the Oregon Coast. Instead of returning to the exit, they consulted a highway map and picked a secondary route that skirted the Wild Rogue Wilderness, a remote area of southwestern Oregon. It is also possible that they may have planned to take this route.\n\nAfter encountering heavy snow at high elevation on Bear Camp Road, they backtracked and ventured onto BLM Road 34-8-36 (), one of hundreds of unpaved logging roads supervised by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) thinking that could be an option. A road gate intended to prevent such mistakes was open despite BLM rules requiring that it be closed. Media outlets reported that vandals had cut a lock on the gate, but a subsequent investigation showed that BLM employees had left it open to avoid trapping local hunters and others who might have ventured past it.\n\nAfter 23 miles of slow travel along Road BLM 34-8-36, the family stopped at about 1.00 a.m. on November 26 because of fatigue and bad weather (). As more snow fell around their immobilized Saab 9-2X station wagon, the Kims kept warm by running its engine. When the vehicle ran out of fuel, they made a campfire of dried wood and magazines. Later, they burned their car's tires to signal rescuers. Search efforts began shortly after November 30, when coworkers of Kim filed a missing persons report with the San Francisco Police Department. After investigators learned that the Kims used their credit card at a local restaurant, search and rescue teams, including local and state police, more than 80 civilian volunteers, the Oregon Army National Guard and several helicopters hired by Mr. Kim's father, Spencer Kim, spent several days looking for the family along area highways and roads, to no avail.\n\nOn December 2, James Kim left his family to look for help, wearing tennis shoes, a jacket, and light clothing. He believed the nearest town (Galice) was located four miles away after studying a map with his wife. He promised his wife he would turn back the same day if he failed to find anyone, but he did not return. Kim backtracked about 11 miles down BLM Road 34-8-36 before leaving the roadway and electing to follow a ravine northeast down the mountain.\n\nAlthough the Kims had a cellular phone with them, their remote location in the mountains was out of range of the cellular network, rendering the phone unusable for voice calls. Despite being unusable for voice calls, their cell phone would play a key role in their rescue. Cell phone text messages may go through even when there appears to be no signal, in part because text messaging is a store-and-forward service. Two Edge Wireless engineers, Eric Fuqua and Noah Pugsley, contacted search and rescue authorities offering their help in the search. On Saturday, December 2, they began searching through the data logs of cell sites, trying to find records of repeaters to which the Kims' cellphone may have connected. They discovered that on November 26, 2006 at around 1:30 a.m., the Kims' cellphone made a brief automatic connection to a cell site near Glendale, Oregon, and retrieved two text messages. Temporary atmospheric conditions, such as tropospheric ducting, can briefly allow radio communications over larger distances than normal. Through the data logs, the engineers determined that the cell phone was in a specific area west of the cellular tower. They then used a computer program to determine which areas in the mountains were within a line-of-sight to the cellular tower. This narrowed the search area tremendously, and finally focused rescue efforts on Bear Camp Road.\n\nOn the afternoon of December 4, John Rachor, a local helicopter pilot unaffiliated with any formal search effort, spotted Mrs. Kim and her two daughters walking on a remote road. After he radioed the family's position to authorities, the three were airlifted out of the area and transferred to a nearby hospital.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said that the discovery of the cellphone connection, and the subsequent analysis of the log data, was the critical breakthrough that ultimately resulted in the rescue of Kim's wife and daughters by helicopter.\n\nOfficials continued to search for Mr. Kim, at one point finding clothing that he had discarded along the way in the likely belief that he was too hot; paradoxical undressing being one of the symptoms of hypothermia. Optimistic Oregon officials stated, \"These were placed with our belief that little signs are being left by James for anyone that may be trying to find him so that they can continue into the area that he's continuing to move in.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, December 6 at 12:03 p.m., Mr. Kim's body was found in Big Windy Creek. () Lying on his back in one to two feet of icy water, he was fully clothed and had been carrying a backpack which contained his identification documents, among other miscellaneous items. He had walked about 16.2 miles (26 km) from the car to that point, and was only a mile from Black Bar Lodge, which, although closed for the winter, was fully stocked at the time. An autopsy revealed that Kim had died because of hypothermia and that his body had suffered no incapacitating physical injuries. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy guessed that Kim had died roughly two days after leaving the vehicle.\n\nBecause of Mr. Kim's background as a technology analyst, observers speculated that the family had used online mapping to find their route. However, Mrs. Kim told state police that they had used a paper road map, an account supported by the Oregon State Police, which reported that the Kims had used an official State of Oregon highway map. Mrs. Kim later recounted that, after they had been stuck for four days and were studying the map for help, both she and Mr. Kim noticed that a box in the corner of the map bore the message: \"Not all Roads Advisable, Check Weather Conditions\".\n\nBear Camp Road is lightly used between October and April, even by local residents, because of its difficult terrain, spotty maintenance, steep drop offs and often inclement weather.\nAs they drove along the road, the Kims passed three prominent warning signs that state: \"Bear Camp Rd. May Be Blocked By Snowdrifts\". Mrs. Kim later told police that they had noticed only one warning sign.\n\nThe Kim family's ordeal became a lead story on most major U.S. news networks, even amidst breaking news of the Iraq Study Group's recommendations on America's war in Iraq. MSNBC.com reported one million page views on the story, making it the top story in the hours after Kim's body was found. CNN.com reported twice as many page views that afternoon as the Iraq story. Within a week, the Kim family appeared on the cover of \"People\" magazine. Newspapers in the region, led by \"The Oregonian\" and the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", devoted heavy coverage to the events and their aftermath.\n\nOn January 6, 2007, \"The Washington Post\" published an op-ed article written by Spencer Kim, James Kim's father, criticizing various government entities that had, in his estimation, played roles in his son's death. The elder Kim blamed the BLM for not locking the gate to the logging road; privacy laws that he claimed had delayed the start of search and rescue efforts; local authorities for \"confusion, communication breakdowns and failures of leadership\" during the search; and the Federal Aviation Administration for not keeping media aircraft out of the search area.\n\nOn February 18, 2007, a memorial service was held for James Kim at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.\n\nOn April 16, 2007, \"The Oregonian\" was awarded the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for a distinguished example of local reporting of breaking news, presented in print or online or both, for their coverage of the Kim family story. The staff of \"The Oregonian\" was lauded for \"its skillful and tenacious coverage of a family missing in the Oregon mountains, telling the tragic story both in print and online\".\n\nOn September 12, 2007, Kati Kim gave an exclusive interview of the ordeal to UK blogging site DollyMix.\n\nIn December 2009, Kati Kim and her daughters made a surprise appearance at a Christmas party being held by the membership of Josephine County Search and Rescue.\n\nIn February 2011, the television show \"20/20\" aired a special 2-hour episode, \"The Wrong Turn\", which included interviews with Kati Kim.\n\nIn September 2011, the television show \"20/20\" aired a second special 2-hour episode, \"The Sixth Sense\", which depicted the same story as in \"The Wrong Turn\".\n\n"}

The franchise is currently being licensed by Italian company Giochi Preziosi for its European release.\n\nThe official slogan, albeit poorly translated, is \"Eyes of Jewel that Shine, glittering with Luck and Good Fortune\".\n\nIn an antique shop, there was a magical Jewel Box which sat there for centuries and shined in very bright colors. A girl accidentally encountered the box and opened it, causing a strange light to shine and the girl was sucked inside. She was now in a strange new world that shined like jewels. A sign read 'Jewel Land'. The girl was amazed, as everything shined in bright colors and was decorated in all kinds of jewels. At the center of the town, there was a strange tower, also decorated with magical jewels. She went to the tower and went inside.\n\nThe girl was greeted by a princess and was happy to see her as she offered her a jewel apple. The girl accepted the gift and the jewel in the girl's hand glowed, magically transforming into a cute animal. The princess said the creature was called a Jewelpet, and each of them live in Jewel Land. However, she also told her the crisis that Jewel Land was facing as the magic was starting to vanish. She told the girl that she must raise that Jewelpet she had into a full-fledged magician.\n\nEach Jewelpet differs from their magical Jewel Eyes and depends on the human partner who awakens them and use magic whenever they need to. They all study magic along with their partners in a special school in Jewel Land for them to become master magicians. The pets and their partners must endure a lot of hardships and even trouble. With each care the human partners give to their Jewelpets, the pets love them back.\n\nFor a Jewelpet to become a magician, it must go through rigorous training and studying with their human partners to prevent the crisis in Jewel Land. If the Jewelpet becomes a magician, they'll be rewarded with a magical Jewel Cloak, as a symbol of mastery over its magic.\n\nThe Jewelpet franchise debuted on January 15, 2008 as the first collaborative project between Sanrio and Sega Toys. The franchise originally started off with 33 characters, each of them being best sellers during the summer of that year with each toy having internet connectivity capabilities using special passwords. As \"Jewelpet\" entered its first year in 2009, the first season of the anime series of the same name premiered.\n\nIn February 2010, 600 items of merchandise were all made with over 25 licensed companies for its overseas and domestic expansion. On March 11, 2010, the 34th Jewelpet, Labra, officially debuted. The characters made their official debut as meet able characters in Sanrio Puroland with their first two shows: and . In addition, after the characters debuted in Puroland, visitors increased by 17% during the fourth quarter of 2010.\n\nIn December 2010, three new Jewelpets officially debuted: Angela, Charotte and Jasper. Charotte and Jasper were both winners of a Jewelpet Design Contest that was held during the airing of Jewelpet Twinkle. In 2011, the Webgurumi website was closed down and was replaced by a new website: Jewel Land Online. In December of that same year, the character Sakuran made its official debut alongside 11 new characters in a new subline called Sweetspets. Sakuran herself is also a winner of the new character design contest that was held during the airing of Jewelpet Sunshine.\n\nOn March 31, 2012, two new male Jewelpets debuted: Coal and Granite. Jewel Land Online ended its service that date as well. In June 2012, the Puroland show opened in conjunction with the \"Jewelpet Kira☆Deco!\" TV series. In August 2012, its first official theatrical film was released in Japanese cinemas with the introduction of the 13th Sweetspet, Gumimin. However, the film proved to be a failure at the box office.\n\nIn the January 2013 Issue of Pucchigumi magazine, the 40th Jewelpet, Rossa was officially revealed. In 2014, the 41st Jewelpet, Luea, was also revealed and in the November 2014 issue of \"Youchien\", marked the debut of the 42nd character Larimar. In 2016, the musicals based on Jewelpet ended its run.\n\nAs of July 2017, the characters were removed in Sanrio Puroland's catalog of meet of greet characters due to rising popularity of the \"Rilu Rilu Fairilu\" Anime series. Japanese netizens expressed their concerns over the issue as the indoor park's representatives stated that the popularity of the new series has caused for the characters to be removed from the lineup.\n\nSega Toys collaborated with Sanrio to release a line of plush toys on January 15, 2008. Each plush Jewelpet contains a password to access the Web-Gurumi website, a special site in which the customer \"adopts\" this pet in the virtual world. If the user doesn't have the password, the user may not get access to the website. Accounts expire within one year, unless another Jewelpet toy is bought, and that animal is added to the user account. With the expansion of the series, toy replicas of the Jewel Stick, Jewel Charms, Jewel Pocketbook and Jewel Pods from the anime series were made as well.\n\nAs with other Sanrio character franchises such as Hello Kitty, My Melody, Sugarbunnies and Cinnamoroll, Jewelpet merchandise mostly consists of stationery, school supplies, bags, raincoats, umbrellas, bento boxes and even toy replicas of the Jewel Stick and Jewel Pocketbook from the anime series.

The sixth installment, was announced by Sanrio via the official Anime Twitter account and aired from April 5, 2014 to March 28, 2015. was revealed in the 2015 Winter Wonder Festival and later in the March 2015 issue of Pucchigumi. It is the final installment of the \"Jewelpet\" franchise, is animated by Studio DEEN and aired from April 4, 2015 to December 26, 2015. It was replaced by \"Rilu Rilu Fairilu: The Fairy's Door\" on February 6, 2016, a month after this program's re-run selected episodes.\n\nThe character designs of the Jewelpets and the human characters were handled by Tomoko Miyakawa (Onegai My Melody) in the first and fourth series. Yukiko Ibe, character designer of Nanatsuiro Drops handles the human character designs for \"Twinkle\" while Mariko Fujita, character designer of Galaxy Angel handles the human character designs for \"Sunshine\".\n\nA feature-length movie titled , was directed by Hiroaki Sakurai (Daa! Daa! Daa!, Cromartie High School) and produced by Studio Comet and Toho. It was released on August 11, 2012, and was a box-office flop\n\nOfficial Storybooks and Reference Books were also issued by Shogakukan during the series's release each year. Two manga spinoffs were also created, and each were published during the airing of the anime series. The first one was serialized in the Shōjo Magazine Pucchigumi with illustrations by Mako Morie in 2009. The first series ended in the same year. On December 28, 2009, a second manga was then serialized in the Shōjo Magazine Ciao with illustrations and story by Yui Horie under Sanrio and Sega Toys' permission. The manga ran from February 2010 to September 2010.\n\nAn official light novel titled was released as part of Kadokawa's Tsubasa Bunko Children's Light Novels on May 15, 2012, written by Hiroko Kanasugi and illustrated by POP. It introduces an exclusive character to the story, a Jewelpet named and the story revolves around her experiences and bond with Ruby and her friends while setting up the Jewel Festival in Jewel Land.\n\nAn official guide book to commemorate the third series was also published by Yousensha, titled . The book is part of the Otoma Anime Collection books and contains character profiles, a story outline, an introduction to the world of Jewelpet, a listing of songs used in the series and interviews from both the cast and staff members of the series. The book was published on June 2, 2012.\n\nSeven video games were also made to tie in with the toy and anime franchises, three were for the Nintendo DS, three for the Nintendo 3DS and one for the video game arcades in Japan.\n\nSeveral musicals were held in Sanrio Puroland and Sanrio Harmonyland, featuring the seven main Jewelpets, Ruby, Sapphie, Garnet, Labra, Angela, Charlotte, Jasper and Rossa. Some of the musicals also feature other Sanrio characters. A musical based on the Kira Deco arc of the anime premiered in Japan in June 2012.\n\nJewelpet ranked 3rd place in the \"Bandai Child Questionnaire\" in June 2010, due to its popularity with children aged 6 to 8 years old and older females alike. The Character franchise is also one of the top 15 highly voted Sanrio Character Franchise in the 26th Sanrio Character Ranking in 2011, ranking into 14th place. It became the 6th highly voted Character Franchise in both the 27th and 28th Sanrio Character Ranking.\n\nThe first Jewelpet anime ranked 7th in the Kanto Video Research, from December 27, 2009 to January 3, 2010 after airing Episodes 39 and 40. Its sequel has received critical acclaim from fans and critics, making the first Sanrio funded anime to appeal in all demographics. The series' main character, Akari Sakura is also ranked 6th in Megahouse's Excellent Model Series 10th Anniversary poll.\n\nIn the press release by Sega Toys on October 1, 2012, the Jewel Pod Diamond sold about 160,000 units in less than two months since its release and topped the charts as the most sold girl's toy in Japan. The company had the target sales of 400,000 by the end of the year and had a combined total of 700,000 units sold on all three Jewel Pods.\n\n\n\n"}

By marriage, she was the Grand Princess of Tuscany and later the Grand Duchess of Tuscany. One of her daughters was Marie de Medici, second wife of King Henry IV of France.\n\nJoanna was born in Prague as the youngest of 15 children. She never knew her mother and eldest sister as her mother died 2 days after Joanna's birth and her sister Elisabeth of Austria, Queen of Poland, died two years before Joanna was born.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Philip I of Castile and Joanna of Castile. Her maternal grandparents were King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary, and Anna of Foix-Candale. Through her father, Joanna was also a descendant of Isabella I of Castile and Mary of Burgundy.\n\nHer marriage to Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, took place on 18 December 1565 in Florence, after she solemnly arrived in the city by the Porta al Prato. Giorgio Vasari and Vincenzo Borghini, with the help of Giovanni Caccini made big festivities for these event. The party was also taken to the Medici Villa in Poggio a Caiano.\n\nNevertheless, Joanna was homesick and unhappy. Ignored by her husband, and despised by the Florentines for her Austrian hauteur, she never felt at home in Florence.\n\nHer father-in-law, Cosimo I de' Medici, was reasonably kind to Joanna. He had the courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio specially decorated for her; the lunettes were painted with murals of Austrian towns by pupils of Vasari, and Verrocchio's \"Putto with Dolphin\" fountain was brought down from the Careggi villa where it had been set up in the garden by Lorenzo de' Medici.\n\nThe position of Joanna in the Florentine court was a difficult one: between 1566 and 1575, she gave birth to six daughters, of whom only three survived infancy. The absence of a male heir to continue the dynasty was the cause of constant conflict with her husband, who preferred the company of his mistress Bianca Cappello, who gave birth to a son, Antonio, in 1576.\n\nFinally, in 1577 Joanna gave birth to the long-awaited heir, baptised Filippo in honour of King Philip II of Spain, Joanna's first cousin. The birth was celebrated with great joy by the court, as now the succession of the Grand Duchy was secured and any ambitions of Bianca Cappello to have her son Antonio as heir of Tuscany were eliminated. However Filippo was to die young, and Joanna's brother-in-law, Ferdinando, succeeded Francesco as Grand Duke.\n\nOn 10 April 1578, Joanna – heavily pregnant with her eighth child – fell from the stairs in the Grand Ducal Palace in Florence. Some hours later, she prematurely gave birth to a son, who died immediately. She died the next day on 11 April. Francesco subsequently married his mistress, Bianca Cappello, making her grand duchess.\n\nThe mysterious circumstances around this accident caused rumours accusing her husband and his mistress of murdering her, so that they could be married. However, modern medical investigation of her remains confirm the official reports of her death as caused by the birth (the child presented arm first, and Joanna suffered a ruptured uterus). Joanna suffered from scoliosis: her spine and pelvis were severely deformed. It is clear from the condition of her pelvis that her previous births had been difficult, and it seems remarkable that she had survived them.\n\nThe eight children of Francesco and Joanna were:\n\n\nOut of a total of eight children, only two daughters, Eleanora and Maria (Marie) lived to adulthood, the rest of the children died young.\n"}

Broussard organized a Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias against the British through King George's War, Father Le Loutre's War and during the French and Indian War. After the loss of Acadia to the British, he eventually led the first group of Acadians to southern Louisiana in present-day United States. His name is sometimes presented as Joseph Gaurhept Broussard; this is likely the result of a transcription error. Broussard is widely regarded as a hero and an important historical figure by both Acadians and Cajuns.\n\nBroussard was born in Port-Royal, Nova Scotia in 1702 to Jean-François Broussard and Catherine Richard. His father came from Poitiers and his mother was born in Port Royal. He lived much of his life at Le Cran (present-day Stoney Creek, Albert County, New Brunswick), along the Petitcodiac River with his wife Agnes and their eleven children.\n\nDuring Father Rale's War, Broussard participated in a raid on Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia (1724).\n\nDuring King George's War, under the leadership of French priest Jean-Louis Le Loutre, Broussard began actively resisting the British occupation of Acadia. Broussard's forces often included Mi'kmaq allies in their resistance against the British. In 1747 he participated in and was later charged for his involvement with the Battle of Grand Pré. (see History of the Acadians)\n\nDuring Father Le Loutre's War, after the construction of Fort Beausejour in 1751, Broussard joined Jean-Louis Le Loutre at Beausejour. In an effort to stop the British movement into Acadia, in 1749 Broussard was involved in one of the first raids on Dartmouth, Nova Scotia which resulted in the deaths of five British settlers. The following year, Broussard was in the Battle at Chignecto and then shortly afterward he led sixty Mi'kmaq and Acadians to attack Dartmouth again, in what would be known as the \"Dartmouth Massacre\" (1751). Broussard and the others killed twenty British civilians and took more prisoners. Cornwallis temporarily abandoned plans to settle Dartmouth.\n\nIn late April 1754, Beausoleil and a large band of Mi'kmaq and Acadians left Chignecto for Lawrencetown. They arrived in mid-May and in the night opened fired on the village. Beausoleil killed and scalped four British settlers and two soldiers. By August, as the raids continued, the residents and soldiers were withdrawn to Halifax.\nIn the Action of 8 June 1755, a naval battle off Cape Race, Newfoundland, on board the French ships Alcide and Lys were found 10,000 scalping knives for Acadians and Indians serving under Chief Jean-Baptiste Cope and Acadian Beausoleil as they continue to fight Father Le Loutre's War.\n\nBroussard was also active in the fight against Lieutenant Colonel Robert Monckton in the Battle of Beausejour.\n\nWith Le Loutre imprisoned after the Battle of Beausejour, Broussard became the leader of an armed resistance during the expulsion of the Acadians (1755–1764), leading assaults against the British on several occasions between 1755 and 1758 as part of the forces of Charles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot.\nAfter arming a ship in 1758, Broussard traveled through the upper Bay of Fundy region, where he attacked the British. His ship was seized in November 1758. He was then forced to flee, travelling first to the Miramichi and later imprisoned at Fort Edward in 1762. Finally, he was transferred and imprisoned with other Acadians in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nReleased in 1764, the year after the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Broussard left Nova Scotia, along with his family and hundreds of other Acadians, to Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti). Unable to adapt to the climate and diseases that was killing Acadians, he led the group to settle in Louisiana.\n\nHe was among the first 200 Acadians to arrive in Louisiana on February 27, 1765, aboard the \"Santo Domingo\". On April 8, 1765, he was appointed militia captain and commander of the \"Acadians of the Atakapas\" the area around present-day St. Martinville, La. Not long after his arrival, Joseph Broussard died near what is now St. Martinville at the presumed age of 63. The exact date of his death is unknown, but it is assumed to have been on or about October 20, 1765. Many of his descendants live in southern Louisiana and Nova Scotia.\n\nBroussard's 21st-century descendants include Célestine \"Tina\" Knowles (née Beyincé), her two daughters Beyoncé and Solange, and also her four grandchildren Jules, Blue, Sir, and Rumi.\n\nThe Cajun music group BeauSoleil is named after him.\n\nA New Brunswick group \"Beausoleil Broussard\" was very popular in the 1970s.\n\nHe is a character in the novel \"Banished from Our Home: The Acadian Diary of Angelique Richard, Grand-Pre, Acadia, 1755\" (2004) by Sharon Stewart. \n\nA dramatized, historically inaccurate version of Beausoleil is featured in the Acadian novel \"Pélagie-la-Charette,\" by Antonine Maillet.\n\nPart of his militant Acadian hero story is told in the documentary feature \"Zachary Richard, Cajun Heart\" by Acadian director Phil Comeau.\n\n\n"}

Brewer caught the first college touchdown pass thrown by Bradshaw. Brewer was initially given a two-year contract with the Atlanta Falcons, but he left the team after sustaining an injury at the training camp in Johnson City, Tennessee.\nIn 1969, Brewer was among five members of the Louisiana Tech football team selected for All-Gulf State Conference honors by the Louisiana Sports Writers Association. The others were Bradshaw, split end Thomas Allen \"Tommy\" Spinks of Shreveport and later Arlington, Texas, offensive tackle Wayne Williams, Jr., later the Webster Parish school superintendent, and defensive back Mark Graham. Brewer and Spinks were recorded among the top pass receivers in Louisiana Tech history. Seven other Tech players were cited for \"honorable mention\" by the same sports writers, who also selected Tech coach Maxie Lambright as the GSC \"Coach of the Year\".\n\nBrewer played in four post-season classics, including two Grantland Rice Bowls, the North-South Shrine Game, and the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama. He was voted Minden's \"Outstanding Advertiser\" a month before \"Larry Brewer Day\" was observed in his hometown on May 14, 1970.\n\nBrewer was born in Minden to the former Helen Lockhart (1924-2018), a former civil servant originally from Ringgold in Bienville Parish, and Henry Clinton \"Clint\" Brewer (1920–2008), a graduate of Doyline High School in Doyline in south Webster Parish. The senior Brewer attended United Methodist-affiliated Centenary College in Shreveport, compiled a distinguished military record in World War II, was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Louisiana National Guard, and served as the Webster Parish registrar of voters until his retirement in 1985.\n\nLarry Brewer played successfully for Minden High School, from which he graduated on May 24, 1966. He procured his bachelor's degree from Tech, located in Ruston in Lincoln Parish, and then coached football at several private schools including Trinity Heights Academy in Shreveport and Sam Barthe School for Boys in Metairie in Jefferson Parish. Brewer also taught junior high school science at Barthe. His first wife, Nancy, taught mathematics at the same school. Brewer subsequently left coaching and received a Master of Science degree from the University of Louisiana at Monroe in Ouachita Parish and thereafter passed the Certified Public Accountant examination.

{"id": "18393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18393", "title": "Life", "text": "Life\n\nLife is a characteristic that distinguishes physical entities that have biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (they have died), or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential synthetic life as \"living\". Biology is the science concerned with the study of life.\n\nThe definition of life is controversial. The current definition is that organisms are open systems that maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, have a life cycle, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, reproduce and evolve. However, several other biological definitions have been proposed, and there are some borderline cases of life, such as viruses or viroids. In the past, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by \"life\" through obsolete concepts such as odic force, hylomorphism, spontaneous generation and vitalism, that have now been disproved by biological discoveries. Abiogenesis describes the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. Properties common to all organisms include the need for certain core chemical elements to sustain biochemical functions.\n\nLife on Earth first appeared as early as 4.28 billion years ago, soon after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago. Earth's current life may have descended from an RNA world, although RNA-based life may not have been the first. The mechanism by which life began on Earth is unknown, though many hypotheses have been formulated and are often based on the Miller–Urey experiment. The earliest known life forms are microfossils of bacteria. 3.45 billion year old Australian rocks are reported to have contained microorganisms. In 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes thought to be present in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all living organisms, already a complex organism and not the first living thing.\n\nSince its primordial beginnings, life on Earth has changed its environment on a geologic time scale. To survive in most ecosystems, life must often adapt to a wide range of conditions. Some microorganisms, called extremophiles, thrive in physically or geochemically extreme environments that are detrimental to most other life on Earth. Aristotle was the first person to classify organisms. Later, Carl Linnaeus introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of species. Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as cells and microorganisms, forcing dramatic revisions of the structure of relationships between living organisms. The cell is considered the structural and functional unit of life. There are two kinds of cells, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, both of which consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Cells reproduce through a process of cell division, in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells.\n\nThough currently only known on Earth, life need not be restricted to it, and many scientists speculate in the existence of extraterrestrial life. Artificial life is a computer simulation or man-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, which is often used to examine systems related to natural life. Death is the permanent termination of all biological functions which sustain an organism, and as such, is the end of its life. Extinction is the process by which an entire group or taxon, normally a species, dies out. Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms.\n\nThe definition of life has long been a challenge for scientists and philosophers, with many varied definitions put forward. This is partially because life is a process, not a substance. This is complicated by a lack of knowledge of the characteristics of living entities, if any, that may have developed outside of Earth. Philosophical definitions of life have also been put forward, with similar difficulties on how to distinguish living things from the non-living. Legal definitions of life have also been described and debated, though these generally focus on the decision to declare a human dead, and the legal ramifications of this decision.\n\nSince there is no unequivocal definition of life, most current definitions in biology are descriptive. Life is considered a characteristic of something that preserves, furthers or reinforces its existence in the given environment. This characteristic exhibits all or most of the following traits:\n\nThese complex processes, called physiological functions, have underlying physical and chemical bases, as well as signaling and control mechanisms that are essential to maintaining life.\n\nFrom a physics perspective, living beings are thermodynamic systems with an organized molecular structure that can reproduce itself and evolve as survival dictates. Thermodynamically, life has been described as an open system which makes use of gradients in its surroundings to create imperfect copies of itself. Hence, life is a self-sustained chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution. A major strength of this definition is that it distinguishes life by the evolutionary process rather than its chemical composition.\n\nOthers take a systemic viewpoint that does not necessarily depend on molecular chemistry. One systemic definition of life is that living things are self-organizing and autopoietic (self-producing). Variations of this definition include Stuart Kauffman's definition as an autonomous agent or a multi-agent system capable of reproducing itself or themselves, and of completing at least one thermodynamic work cycle. This definition is extended by the apparition of novel functions over time.\n\nWhether or not viruses should be considered as alive is controversial. They are most often considered as just replicators rather than forms of life. They have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\" because they possess genes, evolve by natural selection, and replicate by creating multiple copies of themselves through self-assembly. However, viruses do not metabolize and they require a host cell to make new products. Virus self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life, as it may support the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.\n\nTo reflect the minimum phenomena required, other biological definitions of life have been proposed, with many of these being based upon chemical systems. Biophysicists have commented that living things function on negative entropy. In other words, living processes can be viewed as a delay of the spontaneous diffusion or dispersion of the internal energy of biological molecules towards more potential microstates. In more detail, according to physicists such as John Bernal, Erwin Schrödinger, Eugene Wigner, and John Avery, life is a member of the class of phenomena that are open or continuous systems able to decrease their internal entropy at the expense of substances or free energy taken in from the environment and subsequently rejected in a degraded form.\n\nLiving systems are open self-organizing living things that interact with their environment. These systems are maintained by flows of information, energy, and matter.\n\nSome scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living systems theory is required to explain the nature of life. Such a general theory would arise out of the ecological and biological sciences and attempt to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.\n\nThe idea that the Earth is alive is found in philosophy and religion, but the first scientific discussion of it was by the Scottish scientist James Hutton. In 1785, he stated that the Earth was a superorganism and that its proper study should be physiology. Hutton is considered the father of geology, but his idea of a living Earth was forgotten in the intense reductionism of the 19th century. The Gaia hypothesis, proposed in the 1960s by scientist James Lovelock, suggests that life on Earth functions as a single organism that defines and maintains environmental conditions necessary for its survival. This hypothesis served as one of the foundations of the modern Earth system science.\n\nThe first attempt at a general living systems theory for explaining the nature of life was in 1978, by American biologist James Grier Miller. Robert Rosen (1991) built on this by defining a system component as \"a unit of organization; a part with a function, i.e., a definite relation between part and whole.\" From this and other starting concepts, he developed a \"relational theory of systems\" that attempts to explain the special properties of life. Specifically, he identified the \"nonfractionability of components in an organism\" as the fundamental difference between living systems and \"biological machines.\"\n\nA systems view of life treats environmental fluxes and biological fluxes together as a \"reciprocity of influence,\" and a reciprocal relation with environment is arguably as important for understanding life as it is for understanding ecosystems. As Harold J. Morowitz (1992) explains it, life is a property of an ecological system rather than a single organism or species. He argues that an ecosystemic definition of life is preferable to a strictly biochemical or physical one. Robert Ulanowicz (2009) highlights mutualism as the key to understand the systemic, order-generating behavior of life and ecosystems.\n\nComplex systems biology (CSB) is a field of science that studies the emergence of complexity in functional organisms from the viewpoint of dynamic systems theory. The latter is also often called systems biology and aims to understand the most fundamental aspects of life. A closely related approach to CSB and systems biology called relational biology is concerned mainly with understanding life processes in terms of the most important relations, and categories of such relations among the essential functional components of organisms; for multicellular organisms, this has been defined as \"categorical biology\", or a model representation of organisms as a category theory of biological relations, as well as an algebraic topology of the functional organization of living organisms in terms of their dynamic, complex networks of metabolic, genetic, and epigenetic processes and signaling pathways. Alternative but closely related approaches focus on the interdependance of constraints, where constraints can be either molecular, such as enzymes, or macroscopic, such as the geometry of a bone or of the vascular system.\n\nIt has also been argued that the evolution of order in living systems and certain physical systems obeys a common fundamental principle termed the Darwinian dynamic. The Darwinian dynamic was formulated by first considering how macroscopic order is generated in a simple non-biological system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, and then extending consideration to short, replicating RNA molecules. The underlying order-generating process was concluded to be basically similar for both types of systems.\n\nAnother systemic definition called the operator theory proposes that \"life is a general term for the presence of the typical closures found in organisms; the typical closures are a membrane and an autocatalytic set in the cell\" and that an organism is any system with an organisation that complies with an operator type that is at least as complex as the cell. Life can also be modeled as a network of inferior negative feedbacks of regulatory mechanisms subordinated to a superior positive feedback formed by the potential of expansion and reproduction.\n\nSome of the earliest theories of life were materialist, holding that all that exists is matter, and that life is merely a complex form or arrangement of matter. Empedocles (430 BC) argued that everything in the universe is made up of a combination of four eternal \"elements\" or \"roots of all\": earth, water, air, and fire. All change is explained by the arrangement and rearrangement of these four elements. The various forms of life are caused by an appropriate mixture of elements.\n\nDemocritus (460 BC) thought that the essential characteristic of life is having a soul (\"psyche\"). Like other ancient writers, he was attempting to explain what makes something a \"living\" thing. His explanation was that fiery atoms make a soul in exactly the same way atoms and void account for any other thing. He elaborates on fire because of the apparent connection between life and heat, and because fire moves.\n\nThe mechanistic materialism that originated in ancient Greece was revived and revised by the French philosopher René Descartes, who held that animals and humans were assemblages of parts that together functioned as a machine. In the 19th century, the advances in cell theory in biological science encouraged this view. The evolutionary theory of Charles Darwin (1859) is a mechanistic explanation for the origin of species by means of natural selection.\n\nHylomorphism is a theory first expressed by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (322 BC). The application of hylomorphism to biology was important to Aristotle, and biology is extensively covered in his extant writings. In this view, everything in the material universe has both matter and form, and the form of a living thing is its soul (Greek \"psyche\", Latin \"anima\"). There are three kinds of souls: the \"vegetative soul\" of plants, which causes them to grow and decay and nourish themselves, but does not cause motion and sensation; the \"animal soul\", which causes animals to move and feel; and the \"rational soul\", which is the source of consciousness and reasoning, which (Aristotle believed) is found only in man. Each higher soul has all of the attributes of the lower ones. Aristotle believed that while matter can exist without form, form cannot exist without matter, and that therefore the soul cannot exist without the body.\n\nThis account is consistent with teleological explanations of life, which account for phenomena in terms of purpose or goal-directedness. Thus, the whiteness of the polar bear's coat is explained by its purpose of camouflage. The direction of causality (from the future to the past) is in contradiction with the scientific evidence for natural selection, which explains the consequence in terms of a prior cause. Biological features are explained not by looking at future optimal results, but by looking at the past evolutionary history of a species, which led to the natural selection of the features in question.\n\nSpontaneous generation was the belief that living organisms can form without descent from similar organisms. Typically, the idea was that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter such as dust or the supposed seasonal generation of mice and insects from mud or garbage.\n\nThe theory of spontaneous generation was proposed by Aristotle, who compiled and expanded the work of prior natural philosophers and the various ancient explanations of the appearance of organisms; it held sway for two millennia. It was decisively dispelled by the experiments of Louis Pasteur in 1859, who expanded upon the investigations of predecessors such as Francesco Redi. Disproof of the traditional ideas of spontaneous generation is no longer controversial among biologists.\n\nVitalism is the belief that the life-principle is non-material. This originated with Georg Ernst Stahl (17th century), and remained popular until the middle of the 19th century. It appealed to philosophers such as Henri Bergson, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Wilhelm Dilthey, anatomists like Marie François Xavier Bichat, and chemists like Justus von Liebig. Vitalism included the idea that there was a fundamental difference between organic and inorganic material, and the belief that organic material can only be derived from living things. This was disproved in 1828, when Friedrich Wöhler prepared urea from inorganic materials. This Wöhler synthesis is considered the starting point of modern organic chemistry. It is of historical significance because for the first time an organic compound was produced in inorganic reactions.\n\nDuring the 1850s, Hermann von Helmholtz, anticipated by Julius Robert von Mayer, demonstrated that no energy is lost in muscle movement, suggesting that there were no \"vital forces\" necessary to move a muscle. These results led to the abandonment of scientific interest in vitalistic theories, although the belief lingered on in pseudoscientific theories such as homeopathy, which interprets diseases and sickness as caused by disturbances in a hypothetical vital force or life force.\n\nThe age of the Earth is about 4.54 billion years. Evidence suggests that life on Earth has existed for at least 3.5 billion years, with the oldest physical traces of life dating back 3.7 billion years; however, some theories, such as the Late Heavy Bombardment theory, suggest that life on Earth may have started even earlier, as early as 4.1–4.4 billion years ago, and the chemistry leading to life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during an epoch when the universe was only 10–17 million years old.\n\nMore than 99% of all species of life forms, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.\n\nAlthough the number of Earth's catalogued species of lifeforms is between 1.2 million and 2 million, the total number of species in the planet is uncertain. Estimates range from 8 million to 100 million, with a more narrow range between 10 and 14 million, but it may be as high as 1 trillion (with only one-thousandth of one percent of the species described) according to studies realized in May 2016. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 TtC (trillion tons of carbon). In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth.\n\nAll known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, reflecting their common descent; based on these observations, hypotheses on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a universal common ancestor, from simple organic molecules via pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism. Models have been divided into \"genes-first\" and \"metabolism-first\" categories, but a recent trend is the emergence of hybrid models that combine both categories.\n\nThere is no current scientific consensus as to how life originated. However, most accepted scientific models build on the Miller–Urey experiment and the work of Sidney Fox, which show that conditions on the primitive Earth favored chemical reactions that synthesize amino acids and other organic compounds from inorganic precursors, and phospholipids spontaneously form lipid bilayers, the basic structure of a cell membrane.\n\nLiving organisms synthesize proteins, which are polymers of amino acids using instructions encoded by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Protein synthesis entails intermediary ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymers. One possibility for how life began is that genes originated first, followed by proteins; the alternative being that proteins came first and then genes.\n\nHowever, because genes and proteins are both required to produce the other, the problem of considering which came first is like that of the chicken or the egg. Most scientists have adopted the hypothesis that because of this, it is unlikely that genes and proteins arose independently.\n\nTherefore, a possibility, first suggested by Francis Crick, is that the first life was based on RNA, which has the DNA-like properties of information storage and the catalytic properties of some proteins. This is called the RNA world hypothesis, and it is supported by the observation that many of the most critical components of cells (those that evolve the slowest) are composed mostly or entirely of RNA. Also, many critical cofactors (ATP, Acetyl-CoA, NADH, etc.) are either nucleotides or substances clearly related to them. The catalytic properties of RNA had not yet been demonstrated when the hypothesis was first proposed, but they were confirmed by Thomas Cech in 1986.\n\nOne issue with the RNA world hypothesis is that synthesis of RNA from simple inorganic precursors is more difficult than for other organic molecules. One reason for this is that RNA precursors are very stable and react with each other very slowly under ambient conditions, and it has also been proposed that living organisms consisted of other molecules before RNA. However, the successful synthesis of certain RNA molecules under the conditions that existed prior to life on Earth has been achieved by adding alternative precursors in a specified order with the precursor phosphate present throughout the reaction. This study makes the RNA world hypothesis more plausible.\n\nGeological findings in 2013 showed that reactive phosphorus species (like phosphite) were in abundance in the ocean before 3.5 Ga, and that Schreibersite easily reacts with aqueous glycerol to generate phosphite and glycerol 3-phosphate. It is hypothesized that Schreibersite-containing meteorites from the Late Heavy Bombardment could have provided early reduced phosphorus, which could react with prebiotic organic molecules to form phosphorylated biomolecules, like RNA.\n\nIn 2009, experiments demonstrated Darwinian evolution of a two-component system of RNA enzymes (ribozymes) \"in vitro\". The work was performed in the laboratory of Gerald Joyce, who stated \"This is the first example, outside of biology, of evolutionary adaptation in a molecular genetic system.\"\n\nPrebiotic compounds may have originated extraterrestrially. NASA findings in 2011, based on studies with meteorites found on Earth, suggest DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules) may be formed in outer space.\n\nIn March 2015, NASA scientists reported that, for the first time, complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds, according to the scientists.\n\nAccording to the panspermia hypothesis, microscopic life—distributed by meteoroids, asteroids and other small Solar System bodies—may exist throughout the universe.\n\nThe diversity of life on Earth is a result of the dynamic interplay between genetic opportunity, metabolic capability, environmental challenges, and symbiosis. For most of its existence, Earth's habitable environment has been dominated by microorganisms and subjected to their metabolism and evolution. As a consequence of these microbial activities, the physical-chemical environment on Earth has been changing on a geologic time scale, thereby affecting the path of evolution of subsequent life. For example, the release of molecular oxygen by cyanobacteria as a by-product of photosynthesis induced global changes in the Earth's environment. Because oxygen was toxic to most life on Earth at the time, this posed novel evolutionary challenges, and ultimately resulted in the formation of Earth's major animal and plant species. This interplay between organisms and their environment is an inherent feature of living systems.\n\nThe biosphere is the global sum of all ecosystems. It can also be termed as the zone of life on Earth, a closed system (apart from solar and cosmic radiation and heat from the interior of the Earth), and largely self-regulating. By the most general biophysiological definition, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere.\n\nLife forms live in every part of the Earth's biosphere, including soil, hot springs, inside rocks at least deep underground, the deepest parts of the ocean, and at least high in the atmosphere. Under certain test conditions, life forms have been observed to thrive in the near-weightlessness of space and to survive in the vacuum of outer space. Life forms appear to thrive in the Mariana Trench, the deepest spot in the Earth's oceans. Other researchers reported related studies that life forms thrive inside rocks up to below the sea floor under of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States, as well as beneath the seabed off Japan. In August 2014, scientists confirmed the existence of life forms living below the ice of Antarctica. According to one researcher, \"You can find microbes everywhere — they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are.\"\n\nThe biosphere is postulated to have evolved, beginning with a process of biopoesis (life created naturally from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds) or biogenesis (life created from living matter), at least some 3.5 billion years ago. The earliest evidence for life on Earth includes biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks from Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone from Western Australia. More recently, in 2015, \"remains of biotic life\" were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. In 2017, putative fossilized microorganisms (or microfossils) were announced to have been discovered in hydrothermal vent precipitates in the Nuvvuagittuq Belt of Quebec, Canada that were as old as 4.28 billion years, the oldest record of life on earth, suggesting \"an almost instantaneous emergence of life\" after ocean formation 4.4 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago. According to biologist Stephen Blair Hedges, \"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ... then it could be common in the universe.\"\n\nIn a general sense, biospheres are any closed, self-regulating systems containing ecosystems. This includes artificial biospheres such as Biosphere 2 and BIOS-3, and potentially ones on other planets or moons.\n\nThe inert components of an ecosystem are the physical and chemical factors necessary for life—energy (sunlight or chemical energy), water, heat, atmosphere, gravity, nutrients, and ultraviolet solar radiation protection. In most ecosystems, the conditions vary during the day and from one season to the next. To live in most ecosystems, then, organisms must be able to survive a range of conditions, called the \"range of tolerance.\" Outside that are the \"zones of physiological stress,\" where the survival and reproduction are possible but not optimal. Beyond these zones are the \"zones of intolerance,\" where survival and reproduction of that organism is unlikely or impossible. Organisms that have a wide range of tolerance are more widely distributed than organisms with a narrow range of tolerance.\n\nTo survive, selected microorganisms can assume forms that enable them to withstand freezing, complete desiccation, starvation, high levels of radiation exposure, and other physical or chemical challenges. These microorganisms may survive exposure to such conditions for weeks, months, years, or even centuries. Extremophiles are microbial life forms that thrive outside the ranges where life is commonly found. They excel at exploiting uncommon sources of energy. While all organisms are composed of nearly identical molecules, evolution has enabled such microbes to cope with this wide range of physical and chemical conditions. Characterization of the structure and metabolic diversity of microbial communities in such extreme environments is ongoing.\n\nMicrobial life forms thrive even in the Mariana Trench, the deepest spot in the Earth's oceans. Microbes also thrive inside rocks up to below the sea floor under of ocean.\n\nInvestigation of the tenacity and versatility of life on Earth, as well as an understanding of the molecular systems that some organisms utilize to survive such extremes, is important for the search for life beyond Earth. For example, lichen could survive for a month in a simulated Martian environment.\n\nAll life forms require certain core chemical elements needed for biochemical functioning. These include carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—the elemental macronutrients for all organisms—often represented by the acronym CHNOPS. Together these make up nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, the bulk of living matter. Five of these six elements comprise the chemical components of DNA, the exception being sulfur. The latter is a component of the amino acids cysteine and methionine. The most biologically abundant of these elements is carbon, which has the desirable attribute of forming multiple, stable covalent bonds. This allows carbon-based (organic) molecules to form an immense variety of chemical arrangements. Alternative hypothetical types of biochemistry have been proposed that eliminate one or more of these elements, swap out an element for one not on the list, or change required chiralities or other chemical properties.\n\nDeoxyribonucleic acid is a molecule that carries most of the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins and complex carbohydrates, they are one of the three major types of macromolecule that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides since they are composed of simpler units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of a nitrogen-containing nucleobase—either cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A), or thymine (T)—as well as a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. According to base pairing rules (A with T, and C with G), hydrogen bonds bind the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10, and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 TtC (trillion tons of carbon).\n\nDNA stores biological information. The DNA backbone is resistant to cleavage, and both strands of the double-stranded structure store the same biological information. Biological information is replicated as the two strands are separated. A significant portion of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.\n\nThe two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore anti-parallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, \"bases\"). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. Under the genetic code, RNA strands are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins. These RNA strands are initially created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription.\n\nWithin cells, DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes. During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication, providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi, and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In contrast, prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm. Within the chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.\n\nDNA was first isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its molecular structure was identified by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Rosalind Franklin.\n\nLife is usually classified by eight levels of taxa—domains, kingdoms, phyla, class, order, family, genus, and species. In May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.\n\nThe first known attempt to classify organisms was conducted by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC), who classified all living organisms known at that time as either a plant or an animal, based mainly on their ability to move. He also distinguished animals with blood from animals without blood (or at least without red blood), which can be compared with the concepts of vertebrates and invertebrates respectively, and divided the blooded animals into five groups: viviparous quadrupeds (mammals), oviparous quadrupeds (reptiles and amphibians), birds, fishes and whales. The bloodless animals were also divided into five groups: cephalopods, crustaceans, insects (which included the spiders, scorpions, and centipedes, in addition to what we define as insects today), shelled animals (such as most molluscs and echinoderms), and \"zoophytes\" (animals that resemble plants). Though Aristotle's work in zoology was not without errors, it was the grandest biological synthesis of the time and remained the ultimate authority for many centuries after his death.\n\nThe exploration of the Americas revealed large numbers of new plants and animals that needed descriptions and classification. In the latter part of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, careful study of animals commenced and was gradually extended until it formed a sufficient body of knowledge to serve as an anatomical basis for classification. In the late 1740s, Carl Linnaeus introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of species. Linnaeus attempted to improve the composition and reduce the length of the previously used many-worded names by abolishing unnecessary rhetoric, introducing new descriptive terms and precisely defining their meaning.\n\nThe fungi were originally treated as plants. For a short period Linnaeus had classified them in the taxon Vermes in Animalia, but later placed them back in Plantae. Copeland classified the Fungi in his Protoctista, thus partially avoiding the problem but acknowledging their special status. The problem was eventually solved by Whittaker, when he gave them their own kingdom in his five-kingdom system. Evolutionary history shows that the fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.\n\nAs new discoveries enabled detailed study of cells and microorganisms, new groups of life were revealed, and the fields of cell biology and microbiology were created. These new organisms were originally described separately in protozoa as animals and protophyta/thallophyta as plants, but were united by Haeckel in the kingdom Protista; later, the prokaryotes were split off in the kingdom Monera, which would eventually be divided into two separate groups, the Bacteria and the Archaea. This led to the six-kingdom system and eventually to the current three-domain system, which is based on evolutionary relationships. However, the classification of eukaryotes, especially of protists, is still controversial.\n\nAs microbiology, molecular biology and virology developed, non-cellular reproducing agents were discovered, such as viruses and viroids. Whether these are considered alive has been a matter of debate; viruses lack characteristics of life such as cell membranes, metabolism and the ability to grow or respond to their environments. Viruses can still be classed into \"species\" based on their biology and genetics, but many aspects of such a classification remain controversial.\n\nIn the 1960s a trend called cladistics emerged, arranging taxa based on clades in an evolutionary or phylogenetic tree.\n\nIn systems of scientific classification, Biota is the superdomain that classifies all life.\n\nCells are the basic unit of structure in every living thing, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells by division. Cell theory was formulated by Henri Dutrochet, Theodor Schwann, Rudolf Virchow and others during the early nineteenth century, and subsequently became widely accepted. The activity of an organism depends on the total activity of its cells, with energy flow occurring within and between them. Cells contain hereditary information that is carried forward as a genetic code during cell division.\n\nThere are two primary types of cells. Prokaryotes lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, although they have circular DNA and ribosomes. Bacteria and Archaea are two domains of prokaryotes. The other primary type of cells are the eukaryotes, which have distinct nuclei bound by a nuclear membrane and membrane-bound organelles, including mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and vacuoles. In addition, they possess organized chromosomes that store genetic material. All species of large complex organisms are eukaryotes, including animals, plants and fungi, though most species of eukaryote are protist microorganisms. The conventional model is that eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes, with the main organelles of the eukaryotes forming through endosymbiosis between bacteria and the progenitor eukaryotic cell.\n\nThe molecular mechanisms of cell biology are based on proteins. Most of these are synthesized by the ribosomes through an enzyme-catalyzed process called protein biosynthesis. A sequence of amino acids is assembled and joined together based upon gene expression of the cell's nucleic acid. In eukaryotic cells, these proteins may then be transported and processed through the Golgi apparatus in preparation for dispatch to their destination.\n\nCells reproduce through a process of cell division in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. For prokaryotes, cell division occurs through a process of fission in which the DNA is replicated, then the two copies are attached to parts of the cell membrane. In eukaryotes, a more complex process of mitosis is followed. However, the end result is the same; the resulting cell copies are identical to each other and to the original cell (except for mutations), and both are capable of further division following an interphase period.\n\nMulticellular organisms may have first evolved through the formation of colonies of identical cells. These cells can form group organisms through cell adhesion. The individual members of a colony are capable of surviving on their own, whereas the members of a true multi-cellular organism have developed specializations, making them dependent on the remainder of the organism for survival. Such organisms are formed clonally or from a single germ cell that is capable of forming the various specialized cells that form the adult organism. This specialization allows multicellular organisms to exploit resources more efficiently than single cells. In January 2016, scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule, called GK-PID, may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.\n\nCells have evolved methods to perceive and respond to their microenvironment, thereby enhancing their adaptability. Cell signaling coordinates cellular activities, and hence governs the basic functions of multicellular organisms. Signaling between cells can occur through direct cell contact using juxtacrine signalling, or indirectly through the exchange of agents as in the endocrine system. In more complex organisms, coordination of activities can occur through a dedicated nervous system.\n\nThough life is confirmed only on Earth, many think that extraterrestrial life is not only plausible, but probable or inevitable. Other planets and moons in the Solar System and other planetary systems are being examined for evidence of having once supported simple life, and projects such as SETI are trying to detect radio transmissions from possible alien civilizations. Other locations within the Solar System that may host microbial life include the subsurface of Mars, the upper atmosphere of Venus, and subsurface oceans on some of the moons of the giant planets.\nBeyond the Solar System, the region around another main-sequence star that could support Earth-like life on an Earth-like planet is known as the habitable zone. The inner and outer radii of this zone vary with the luminosity of the star, as does the time interval during which the zone survives. Stars more massive than the Sun have a larger habitable zone, but remain on the Sun-like \"main sequence\" of stellar evolution for a shorter time interval. Small red dwarfs have the opposite problem, with a smaller habitable zone that is subject to higher levels of magnetic activity and the effects of tidal locking from close orbits. Hence, stars in the intermediate mass range such as the Sun may have a greater likelihood for Earth-like life to develop. The location of the star within a galaxy may also affect the likelihood of life forming. Stars in regions with a greater abundance of heavier elements that can form planets, in combination with a low rate of potentially habitat-damaging supernova events, are predicted to have a higher probability of hosting planets with complex life. The variables of the Drake equation are used to discuss the conditions in planetary systems where civilization is most likely to exist. Use of the equation to predict the amount of extraterrestrial life, however, is difficult; because many of the variables are unknown, the equation functions as more of a mirror to what its user already thinks. As a result, the number of civilizations in the galaxy can be estimated as low as 9.1 x 10 or as high as 156 million; for the calculations, see Drake equation.\n\nArtificial life is the simulation of any aspect of life, as through computers, robotics, or biochemistry. The study of artificial life imitates traditional biology by recreating some aspects of biological phenomena. Scientists study the logic of living systems by creating artificial environments—seeking to understand the complex information processing that defines such systems. While life is, by definition, alive, artificial life is generally referred to as data confined to a digital environment and existence.\n\nSynthetic biology is a new area of biotechnology that combines science and biological engineering. The common goal is the design and construction of new biological functions and systems not found in nature. Synthetic biology includes the broad redefinition and expansion of biotechnology, with the ultimate goals of being able to design and build engineered biological systems that process information, manipulate chemicals, fabricate materials and structures, produce energy, provide food, and maintain and enhance human health and the environment.\n\nDeath is the permanent termination of all vital functions or life processes in an organism or cell. It can occur as a result of an accident, medical conditions, biological interaction, malnutrition, poisoning, senescence, or suicide. After death, the remains of an organism re-enter the biogeochemical cycle. Organisms may be consumed by a predator or a scavenger and leftover organic material may then be further decomposed by detritivores, organisms that recycle detritus, returning it to the environment for reuse in the food chain.\n\nOne of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. Death would seem to refer to either the moment life ends, or when the state that follows life begins. However, determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems. Such determination therefore requires drawing conceptual lines between life and death. This is problematic, however, because there is little consensus over how to define life. The nature of death has for millennia been a central concern of the world's religious traditions and of philosophical inquiry. Many religions maintain faith in either a kind of afterlife or reincarnation for the soul, or resurrection of the body at a later date.\n\nExtinction is the process by which a group of taxa or species dies out, reducing biodiversity. The moment of extinction is generally considered the death of the last individual of that species. Because a species' potential range may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively after a period of apparent absence. Species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing habitat or against superior competition. In Earth's history, over 99% of all the species that have ever lived are extinct; however, mass extinctions may have accelerated evolution by providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify.\n\nFossils are the preserved remains or traces of animals, plants, and other organisms from the remote past. The totality of fossils, both discovered and undiscovered, and their placement in fossil-containing rock formations and sedimentary layers (strata) is known as the \"fossil record\". A preserved specimen is called a fossil if it is older than the arbitrary date of 10,000 years ago. Hence, fossils range in age from the youngest at the start of the Holocene Epoch to the oldest from the Archaean Eon, up to 3.4 billion years old.\n\n\n"}

The total for 2012 was 4,411 deaths. and 2017 has dropped to 3,694 deaths, of this 2,020 involved a driver over aged 65 or 54.7% of the total, with sharply rising rates of deadly accident with each decade of driver age after 65. Some 36% of deaths were pedestrians, 13% were bicyclists, alcohol related deaths were 1/3 at 213 less than a decade earlier, among a wealth of other statistics.\n\n"}

{"id": "7373647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7373647", "title": "Manphibian", "text": "Manphibian\n\nManphibian is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It has some resemblance to the \"Gill Man\" seen in \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\".\n\nManphibian first appeared in \"Legion of Monsters\" #1 and was created by Marv Wolfman, Tony Isabella, Dave Cockrum, and Sam Grainger.\n\nManphibian's alien species did not suffer the delusional concept of fate. They did not reinvent such calamities in their own minds as a call to a righteous and vital missions like a hunt for revenge. They realized the true motive for such actions was to share their own pain with the world.\n\nManphibian's kind believed in a \"Prime Mover\" where they have not raised a hand against another of their kind for eons. This was until Manphibian's mate was murdered by someone from Manphibian's species. After being denied by his elders to deal with the murderer, Manphibian ended up pursuing the murderer into space. Manphibian's search took him across different planets until landing on Earth thousands of years ago. Many years later, oil drillers woke up the murderous member of Manphibian's race. When Manphibian arrived, he stopped the creature from attacking Beth Fox. Their fight lasted until a missile strike destroyed Shaft #27. Due to Beth Fox being traumatized, her husband Aaron Fox vowed revenge and started hunting both creatures.\n\nManphibian and his mate had multiple offsprings that were simultaneously trapped on Earth. Due to the death of his mate, Manphibian had to raise them on his own.\n\nAt some point, Manphibian was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. in order to be part of Nick Fury's Howling Commandos. Manphibian was seen in Area 13's commissary alongside John Jameson and Golem. Manphibian was with the Howling Commandos when they launched an assault on the forces of Merlin.\n\nDeacon and Blackout considered Manphibian as a possible candidate to fight Ghost Rider.\n\nWhen Robert Hellsgard's Hunter of Monster Special Force began hunting down and slaughtering any being they deemed a monster, Manphibian joined up with the Legion of Monsters to defend those from being attacked by the Hunter of Monster Special Force. The Legion of Monsters led the survivors to the abandoned Morlock tunnels beneath Manhattan which had been a haven for monsters centuries earlier. The Legion of Monsters converted the haven into Monster Metropolis where it is feared to be the last stand against the Hunter of Monster Special Force.\n\nManphibian's children couldn't join Manphibian in Monster Metropolis as their bodies need clean water and the catacombs near Monster Metropolis have a short supply of clean water. After Punisher was slain by Wolverine's son Daken, Manphibian was present when the Moloids brought Punisher's remains to Morbius, the Living Vampire who revived Punisher as a Frankenstein's monster-like creature called FrankenCastle. Manphibian stated that Punisher had been reborn wild as he cautions his fellow Legion of Monsters. It took the Legion of Monsters to subdue Punisher so that they can finish fixing his brain. Manphibian left Monster Metropolis to check up on his children and was captured by the Hunter of Monster Special Force. Manphibian was transported to the Hunter of Monster Special Force's base in the Alps where they tortured him to give up the location of Monster Metropolis. Robert Hellsgard tortured Manphibian, trying to get him to provide the location to the monster refuge; however, he resisted the torture. Hellsgard finally showed him the corpses of Manphibian's children, stating that they had given up the location during their own torture session- his torture of Manphibian had been for his own perverse pleasure. Following the attack on Monster Metropolis, FrankenCastle raided the Hunter of Monster Special Force's base to rescue Manphibian and the other captive monsters. Robert Hellsgard engaged the Legion of Monsters where he used a buzzsaw on Manphibian's chest and blasted FrankenCastle in the face. Manphibian managed to get to his feet and rejoins the battle. When the group ends up transported to Limbo, Manphibian manages to haul Robert Hellsgard out of his body armor after he was knocked down. FrankenCastle stopped Manphibian from killing Hellsgard as revenge for the murder of his children. Manphibian stated that he is nothing like Robert Hellsgard and is above killing for petty vengeance. When the portal to Earth opened, FrankenCastle, Manphibian, and Morbius returned to Earth while leaving Robert Hellsgard in Limbo. Hellsgard thanked FrankenCastle for his mercy, to which Castle sardonically replied, \"Yeah, right... Mercy\".\n\nBack at Monster Metropolis, Manphibian was badly injured from the battle and was bandaged up. After FrankenCastle was healed, Manphibian led FrankenCastle to Monster Metropolis' cells where the captive members of the Hunter of Monster Special Force soldiers are being held and did not know what to do with them. As no court would prosecute them, Manphibian asked FrankenCastle what should be done with them. As FrankenCastle handed Manphibian a gun and walked away, Manphibian had no intent to use it on them. Following FrankenCastle's rampage in Tokyo, Manphibian was with the Legion of Monsters when it comes to helping Elsa Bloodstone lure FrankenCastle to Monster Island.\n\nManphibian and Morbius heklped N'Kantu, the Living Mummy and Werewolf by Night capture the Dimensional Man. Elsa Bloodstone teleported into Monster Metropolis with a dead monster that was taken into custody. It was soon revealed that the dead monster was corrupted by a powerful force.\n\nWhen Red Hulk journeyed to Monster Metropolis, Manphibian helped Red Hulk and Werewolf by Night overcome panicked monsters in order to stop the ghost of Doc Samson's bad side. Manphibian and the Legion of Monsters helped Red Hulk and Doctor Strange defeat the ghost of Doc Samson's bad side.\n\nManphibian joined the Legion of Monsters into evacuating Brownville so that Morbius can confront Rose who is wielding a makeshift Ultimate Nullifier. Manphibian was the one who kept Morbius' friend Becky Barnes safe. Following Morbius' wish that Becky Barnes would be kept safe, Manphibian carried Becky Barnes away from the wreckage to keep her safe.\n\nManphibian was one of several beings (along with the Uncanny Avengers) captured by Mojo to appear in one of Mojo's films. He was paired up with Blade, Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, Man-Thing, and Satana as the Avengers of the Supernatural.\n\nAs part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\" event, Manphibian appears as a member of S.T.A.K.E.'s Howling Commandos.\n\nManphibian was with the Howling Commandos at the time when they help Old Man Logan rescue Jubilee from Dracula.\n\nManphibian possesses superhuman strength which is enough to tear a fifteen-foot tree from the ground. Manphibian also has sharp claws and its skin is strong enough to withstand missiles.\n\nThe Manphibian was ranked #28 on a listing of Marvel Comics' monster characters in 2015.\n\n"}
{"id": "37895373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37895373", "title": "Murder of Maria Ridulph", "text": "Murder of Maria Ridulph\n\nMaria Elizabeth Ridulph (March 12, 1950 – c. December 1957) was an American girl who disappeared on December 3, 1957 from a street corner in her neighborhood in Sycamore, Illinois when she was seven years old. She was last seen by a childhood friend in the company of an unknown man who appeared to be in his early twenties and called himself \"Johnny\". Nearly five months later, her remains were found in a wooded area near Woodbine, Illinois, approximately 100 miles from her home.\n\nThe case, well known in the Chicago area, was widely reported as the oldest cold case murder in the United States to be solved when Jack McCullough, who under his former name John Tessier had been a neighbor of the Ridulph family, was wrongly convicted for her murder in September 2012. However, in March 2016, the DeKalb County State's Attorney announced that a post-conviction review of available evidence showed McCullough could not have been present at the place and time of Maria Ridulph's likely abduction. McCullough was released from prison on April 15, 2016 and the charges against him were dismissed on April 22, 2016. McCullough was declared innocent of the crime by the DeKalb County Circuit Court on April 12, 2017.\n\nMaria Ridulph was born on March 12, 1950, to Michael and Frances Ivy Ridulph in Sycamore, Illinois. She was the youngest of four children, and had two sisters and a brother. Although many residents lived or worked on farms in the area, her father Michael worked at one of Sycamore's few factories; her mother Frances was a homemaker. At the time she was abducted, Maria was 7 years old, 44 inches tall, and weighed 53 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes. She was an honor student, then in second grade. She also received awards for perfect Sunday school attendance at Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. John.\n\nAccording to her mother, Maria was high-strung. \"My daughter was a nervous girl and if she got in any trouble would become hysterical,\" Frances said in a 1957 interview shortly after Maria disappeared. \"Someone would probably have to kill her to keep her quiet. I am the only one who could calm her down.\" Maria was also described as a \"screamer\" and afraid of the dark. Her best friend was 8-year-old Kathy Sigman, who lived on the same street as the Ridulphs.\n\nOn the evening of December 3, 1957, Maria begged to be allowed to go outside as it had started to snow. After finishing dinner, Maria and Kathy Sigman went outside in the dark (as the sun had set) near Maria's house and played a game they called \"duck the cars\", running back and forth trying to avoid the headlights of oncoming cars in the street. According to Kathy, they were approached by a man, whom Kathy later described to police as in his early 20s and tall with a slender chin, light hair, a gap in his teeth, and wearing a colorful sweater. The man, who said his name was \"Johnny\", told the girls that he was 24 and not married. He asked if they liked dolls and if they liked piggyback rides. He gave Maria a piggyback ride, after which she went back to her house and got a doll to show him. After Maria returned, Kathy ran back to her house to get her mittens, leaving Maria alone with the man. When Kathy returned, Maria and the man were gone.\n\nKathy went to the Ridulph house to tell them she couldn't find Maria. The family initially thought Maria was hiding, and sent Maria's 11-year-old brother to look for her. After he was unable to find her, the Ridulphs called the police, and within an hour, police and armed civilians began a search of the town, but failed to locate Maria or \"Johnny\", the man with whom she was last seen. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), presuming that Maria might have been abducted across state lines (a federal crime), arrived in Sycamore within two days to help the local and state police in the search. The FBI and police interviewed numerous witnesses who had seen the two girls playing without any other person present between 6 pm and 6:30 pm, and also spoke to family members who had seen or spoken with Maria and Kathy in the course of Maria getting her doll, Kathy getting her mittens, and Kathy reporting Maria's disappearance to the Ridulphs. Based on these interviews, \"Johnny\" was thought to have approached the girls after 6:30 pm, and the FBI concluded that Maria was abducted between 6:45 and 7 pm.\nKathy Sigman was the only witness who had seen \"Johnny\" and was placed in protective custody, as the police and FBI feared that the kidnapper would come back and harm her. The authorities had her look at photos of convicted felons or suspects who bore a resemblance to \"Johnny\". John Tessier, who was convicted of the crime over 50 years later, lived in the girls' neighborhood and was on the original list of suspects based on a tip, but the police failed to have Kathy identify him after he provided an alibi for the night of the crime (see Suspect). In late December 1957, Kathy was taken to the Dane County Sheriff's Office in Madison, Wisconsin to see a lineup of possible suspects. She positively identified Thomas Joseph Rivard, described in FBI documents as a 35-year-old man approximately 5 foot 4 inches tall and 156 lbs., with dark blond wavy (bushy) hair. However, Rivard had an alibi, as he was in jail at the time of the kidnapping; police suspected someone else in the lineup as the real culprit and Rivard was merely used to fill out the lineup. Rivard also did not physically resemble Tessier, who was six inches taller and 17 years younger than Rivard. When asked years later about the 1957 lineup, Kathy said she did not remember picking Rivard out of the lineup.\n\nMaria's disappearance received national news coverage, and both President Dwight D. Eisenhower and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover took an interest in the case. Law enforcement continued to investigate various suspects in the area, including transients, known sex offenders, and a local man who had given children piggyback rides, but developed no solid leads. Maria's parents appeared on television and in other media pleading for their daughter's safe return and the public's help in finding her.\n\nOn April 26, 1958, near Woodbine, Illinois (23 miles east of Galena and approximately 100 miles from Sycamore), two tourists searching for mushrooms in a wooded area along US Route 20 discovered the skeletal remains of a small child, wearing only a shirt, undershirt, and socks, under a partially fallen tree. The decomposed condition of the body indicated it had been there for several months. The body was identified as Maria Ridulph based on dental records, a lock of hair, and the shirts and socks she had been wearing when she disappeared. The rest of Maria's clothing, including her coat, slacks, shoes and an undergarment, was not found. No photographs were taken of the crime scene (although photos were taken of the general location without showing the body) because the coroner, James Furlong, did not want photos of the child's body leaked to newspapers. Because the crime had occurred within Illinois rather than crossing state lines, the FBI withdrew from the case, leaving it to state and local police.\n\nThe initial autopsy did not determine a cause of death due to the state of decomposition. During an autopsy done 50 years later, a forensic anthropologist determined Maria had likely been stabbed several times in the throat (see Reopening of case).\n\nJohn Tessier was born John Cherry on November 27, 1939 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to British sergeant Samuel Cherry and his wife Eileen McCullough Cherry. Samuel Cherry was killed early in World War II. During the war, Eileen Cherry served as one of the first female airplane spotters with the UK's Royal Air Force and met Ralph Tessier, who was serving with the United States 8th Army-Air Force at RAF Bovingdon, England. She married Ralph Tessier in November 1944, and after the war, she and her son John, then aged 7, followed Ralph to Sycamore, Illinois, where Ralph and Eileen had six more children together over the years. After his mother's marriage, John used the last name Tessier, although he was still sometimes called John Cherry.\n\nThe Tessier family home in Sycamore was located around the corner from the Ridulph home, less than two blocks away. Ralph Tessier, a sign painter, painted insignia on the doors of Sycamore police cars and was friendly with the police chief. John Tessier was expelled from school in the tenth grade for pushing a teacher and calling her a name. At the time of Maria Ridulph's disappearance, he was 18 years old and living at home with his parents and siblings while making plans to join the U.S. Air Force.\n\nOn December 4, investigators visited the Tessier home as part of their neighborhood search for Maria. According to Tessier's half-sisters Katherine Tessier (Caulfield) and Jeanne Tessier, their mother told the investigators that John Tessier had been home on the night of December 3, something that they later testified was not true. Shortly thereafter, before Maria's body was found, the FBI investigated Tessier as a possible suspect. Sources differ on whether the investigation was triggered by a tip from a local resident or by John Tessier's own parents seeking to clear their son, who they realized had the same name and general description as \"Johnny\".\n\nTessier and his parents told FBI investigators that on December 3, 1957, Tessier was in Rockford, Illinois, approximately 40 miles northwest of Sycamore, to enlist in the Air Force. (This story differed from his mother's previous statement, as reported by her daughters, that Tessier had been home all night.) He said he had been in Chicago on December 2 and 3 undergoing physical examinations required for his enlistment. On the morning of December 3 he had visited the Chicago recruiting station (which was corroborated by records) and then spent the day sightseeing in Chicago before returning to Rockford by train that evening, arriving there at 6:45 pm. Upon his arrival in Rockford, he had called his parents to ask for a ride home to Sycamore, since he had taken the train to and from Chicago and left his own car at home. Telephone records were later found showing that a collect call was placed from the Rockford post office to the Tessier home at 6:57 pm that evening by someone who gave his name as \"John Tassier\" as written down by the operator. After making the call, Tessier then met with officers from the Rockford recruiting station to drop off paperwork relating to his enlistment. The officers confirmed that they spoke with Tessier around 7:15 pm that evening, although one officer also expressed some concerns about Tessier's credibility and conduct. Tessier was brought to the police station to take a lie detector test, which he passed. In view of his alibi and the lie detector test result, Tessier was taken off the suspect list, and the FBI closed out his report on December 10, 1957, noting: \"No further investigation is being conducted regarding the above suspect.\" Kathy Sigman was never shown a photograph of him or asked to identify him. Tessier left Sycamore the next day to report for basic training at Lackland Air Force Base.\n\nTessier served in the U.S. military for thirteen years and rose to the rank of captain. After leaving the service, he moved to Seattle, Washington, where he subsequently graduated from the King County Law Enforcement Academy in June 1974 and became a police officer in the small town of Lacey near Olympia. He later joined the police department in Milton, Washington where he clashed with the chief of police, who attempted to fire him and documented a long list of complaints about his work and conduct. In 1982, in Tacoma, Washington, Tessier took in a 15-year-old runaway, Michelle Weinman, and her friend, who knew Tessier as a Milton police officer. Weinman later testified that shortly after she began living with Tessier, he fondled her and then performed oral sex on her. Tessier was charged with statutory rape, a felony. After plea negotiations, he eventually pleaded guilty to communication with a minor for immoral purposes, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to one year of formal probation and was terminated from the Milton Police Department on March 10, 1982.\n\nOn April 27, 1994, John Tessier legally changed his name to Jack Daniel McCullough, saying that he wanted to honor his late mother. By 2011, McCullough, now in his early 70s, was living at a retirement community in northwest Seattle where he worked as a security guard.\n\nIn 1997, Sycamore Police Lieutenant Patrick Solar closed the then-40-year-old Ridulph case, naming William Henry Redmond, a former truck driver and carnival worker from Nebraska who had died in 1992, as the man who had likely abducted and killed Maria Ridulph. Redmond had been charged in 1988 with the 1951 murder of an 8-year-old Pennsylvania girl, although that case was dismissed when a police officer refused to reveal the name of a confidential informant. Redmond was also a suspect in the 1951 disappearance of 10-year-old Beverly Potts in Ohio. According to Solar, Redmond told a fellow inmate that he committed a crime similar to the Ridulph abduction and murder. Solar also believed that Redmond's appearance and behavior matched that of \"Johnny\".\n\nSolar's report was criticized due to lack of supporting evidence and alleged political motivations. Solar himself acknowledged that the evidence against Redmond was circumstantial and that if Redmond had lived, it would have been difficult to convict him in the Ridulph case unless he confessed. For that reason, Solar called the Ridulph case \"closed, but not solved\", leaving open the possibility that a better suspect might later be found. When Jack McCullough was later tried in the Ridulph case, the trial judge ruled out any testimony about Redmond on the grounds that he was not a credible suspect.\n\nThe case was reopened in 2008 based on new information from McCullough's half-sister Janet Tessier. According to Janet, their mother Eileen Tessier on her deathbed in January 1994 had said, \"Those two little girls, and the one that disappeared, John did it. John did it, and you have to tell someone.\" Janet took the statement as meaning that her half-brother, John Tessier (soon to rename himself Jack McCullough) had kidnapped and murdered Maria Ridulph; she had also heard from her older sisters (Katherine Tessier (Caulfield) and Jeanne Tessier) that Eileen had lied to investigators that he was home on the night of the crime. Another of McCullough's half-sisters, Mary Pat Tessier (Hunt), was also present when Eileen spoke to Janet, but later testified that she had only heard her mother say, \"He did it.\" Nevertheless, Mary Pat testified that she had the same understanding as Janet and that her older sisters had suspected John Tessier of the murder for years. At the time, Eileen, a cancer patient, was on morphine and according to her doctor was \"disoriented\". McCullough, who allegedly had once threatened to kill Janet with a gun and sexually molested his half-sister Jeanne when she was a minor, was estranged from the Tessier family by the time of Eileen's death. He was told not to attend her funeral.\n\nJanet Tessier said that she made several fruitless attempts over the next fourteen years to get law enforcement, including the Sycamore police and the FBI (who referred her back to the Sycamore police), to look into her mother's statement. Patrick Solar, who during part of this time was a lieutenant with the Sycamore police and had identified William Henry Redmond as the most likely suspect in the Ridulph murder, told CNN that Janet had never spoken to him, but that he would not have suspected John Tessier (Jack McCullough) because he knew the Tessier family, Ralph Tessier had painted the Sycamore police cars, and John Tessier had been cleared by the FBI in 1957. In 2008, Janet e-mailed an Illinois State Police tip line, resulting in the state police cold case unit undertaking a lengthy investigation into McCullough's background and alibi.\n\nJanet's sisters Katherine and Jeanne told investigators of their suspicions, and Jeanne said that John had molested her as a child and other young girls. Another woman alleged that John Tessier had given her a piggyback ride as a child and refused to put her down until her father intervened. State police investigators reviewed evidence and developed a new timeline under which Tessier could have kidnapped Maria and driven to Rockford in time to make a telephone call at 6:57 pm and meet with recruiting officers at 7:15 pm. Under this new timeline, they determined that Maria would have been kidnapped no later than 6:20 pm. The police search for Maria was underway by 7 pm according to Katherine, who said she had returned home from a party at 7 pm to find the search in progress.\nHoping to have Kathy Chapman (née Sigman) review a photographic lineup, police took five pictures from the 1957 Sycamore High School yearbook, but John Tessier's picture was not in the yearbook as he had been expelled. Police obtained a contemporary photo of him from his former girlfriend, which differed from the yearbook photos in that Tessier was wearing an open collar rather than a suit and the background was dark rather than light. Chapman identified the picture of Tessier.\n\nAlong with the picture, Tessier's former girlfriend provided an unused, military-issued train ticket from Rockford to Chicago dated December 1957. The investigators took this to suggest that contrary to Tessier's alibi, Tessier had not taken the train on his trip to Chicago and had instead driven his car there, meaning that he could have driven back to Sycamore after noon on December 3, kidnapped Maria, and driven to Rockford. The police located a high school friend of Tessier's who recalled seeing Tessier's distinctively painted car in Sycamore that afternoon, and said that Tessier did not let anyone else drive his car.\n\nIn July 2011 the Seattle Police Department, which had joined with the Illinois State Police in the investigation, brought McCullough in for questioning (using a professional interrogator due to McCullough's law enforcement experience). At first, McCullough spoke calmly and cooperated, but when faced with questions about the murder of Maria Ridulph and his whereabouts on the night of the crime, he became evasive and aggressive. After McCullough refused to answer any more questions, he was arrested for the kidnapping and murder of Maria Ridulph and extradited to Illinois.\n\nMaria's body was exhumed that same month to check for DNA evidence, but none could be found. However, a forensic anthropologist found that Maria had been stabbed in the throat at least three times by a long, sharp blade, pointing out nicks in her sternum and neck vertebrae, consistent with \"at least three\" slashes to her throat. Although stabbing was considered a likely cause of death, an appellate court later stated that the findings did not preclude other possible causes of death such as ligature strangulation, which could not be adequately investigated due to the decomposition of soft tissue.\n\nNews of the arrest in a 54-year-old murder case drew national attention. The lead prosecutor, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell, was reluctant to take the case due to its age and the lack of any physical evidence connecting McCullough to the crime. But, after being persuaded by the Ridulph and Tessier families, who all believed that McCullough was guilty, he formally charged McCullough with the kidnapping and murder of Maria.\n\nIn September 2012, McCullough was tried in DeKalb County, Illinois for the kidnapping and murder of Maria Ridulph, and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the court vacated his convictions on the lesser kidnapping charges, but upheld his murder conviction. McCullough then petitioned for post-conviction relief, asking that his murder conviction be set aside. After DeKalb County's top prosecutor reviewed the evidence and determined that McCullough could not have committed the crime based on the evidence, his murder conviction was overturned and he was released from prison in April 2016. The DeKalb County Circuit Court declared McCullough to be actually innocent of the crime on April 12, 2017.\n\nAt trial, the prosecution contended that McCullough was attracted to Maria and decided to kidnap her, but instead ended up killing her, presenting new autopsy reports suggesting Maria was stabbed to death. Although the prosecutors suspected McCullough of molesting Maria, they were unable to prove it and never brought it up in court. Numerous witnesses testified for the prosecution, including Maria's family members, neighbors, law enforcement personnel and Kathy Sigman Chapman, who was the star witness and identified McCullough as \"Johnny\", the man who had walked up to her and Maria 50 years earlier. Another childhood friend of Maria's testified that she had also been offered a piggyback ride from \"Johnny\" and identified him as McCullough. Three inmates who were jailed with McCullough testified that he talked about killing Maria. However, their stories were both inconsistent and failed to match the evidence indicating Maria had been stabbed. One inmate said McCullough spoke of strangling Maria with a wire, and another said McCullough accidentally smothered her to stop her from screaming.\n\nThe defense argued that the prosecutors and police were pressured by the Ridulph and Tessier families to solve the case and implicate McCullough, although there was no physical evidence, motive, or indication that McCullough was in the area when Maria was kidnapped. McCullough did not take the stand in his own defense on the advice of his attorneys.\n\nOn September 14, 2012, McCullough was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of Maria Ridulph and received a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 20 years. He was 73 years old at the time of sentencing.\n\nMcCullough appealed his convictions. On February 13, 2015, the Illinois Appellate Court (Second District) upheld his murder conviction, but vacated his convictions for kidnapping and abduction of an infant as being outside the three-year statute of limitations in effect for those crimes in 1957. The decision had no effect on McCullough's life sentence, as the sentencing court had provided that the sentences for kidnapping and abduction would \"merge\" into McCullough's life sentence for murder. Although the appellate court ruled that Eileen Tessier's deathbed statement should not have been admitted as evidence against McCullough, the court declined to overturn the murder conviction because Judge Hallock did not rely heavily upon the statement in issuing the conviction.\n\nIn 2015, McCullough, acting pro se, filed a petition for post-conviction relief asking that his murder conviction be set aside. After McCullough's petition was initially dismissed by the court as \"frivolous and without merit\", the public defender who had originally represented McCullough at trial — and who had continued to investigate the case while staying in touch with McCullough, despite the fact that he was no longer appointed to defend McCullough — asked the court to reconsider the dismissal. McCullough filed a successive motion that could not be denied without a hearing from the State Attorney's Office.\n\nIn response to the motions, DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack, who had replaced Clay Campbell in that position, conducted an extensive review of the evidence, which led Schmack to conclude that McCullough could not have committed the crime and was actually innocent. According to Schmack, evidence was kept out of the trial that clearly established McCullough's whereabouts on the evening of Maria Ridulph's abduction and supported his alibi. In particular, phone records from Illinois Bell showed that McCullough made a collect call to his mother that evening from a pay phone in downtown Rockford rather than from Sycamore as alleged at his trial. Given the timing of the telephone call, the approximately 40-mile distance between Sycamore and Rockford, and icy road conditions, Schmack concluded that McCullough could not possibly have been in Sycamore at the time of Maria Ridulph's disappearance.\n\nFollowing a March 2016 court hearing, on April 15, 2016 Judge William P. Brady of the Illinois Circuit Court vacated McCullough's original conviction and sentence and ordered a new trial. McCullough, who remained charged with the crime, was released on bond that day pending the new trial. A week later, Judge Brady dismissed the charges against McCullough; however, the dismissal of the murder charge was without prejudice, meaning that McCullough could be tried again for the murder of Maria Ridulph should a prosecutor wish to do so. Brady postponed ruling on a request by Maria's brother Charles Ridulph, backed by the signatures of hundreds of Sycamore citizens including the city's mayor, that a special prosecutor be appointed to replace Schmack on McCullough's case. On August 5, 2016, Judge Brady denied the motion for a special prosecutor; Charles Ridulph then stated that he would not appeal the ruling.\n\nMcCullough was declared actually innocent of the crime by the DeKalb County Circuit Court on April 12, 2017.\n\nOn July 21, 2016 Porter, son-in-law of McCullough, filed a lawsuit (Case 2016-CH-09536 (Cook County, Illinois)) against the Illinois State Police and Sycamore Police Department for refusal to comply with a Freedom of Information Act request related to the investigation of the case. The FOIA request was prompted by Schmack's allegations of police misconduct on November 3, 2015.\n\nThe \"Maria Ridulph Memorial Map\", an eight-foot-square map of Sycamore constructed of steel and porcelain, was mounted on the front exterior of the Sycamore Municipal Building in 1958, in commemoration of Maria Ridulph. The map was removed in 2002 and replaced with a bronze memorial plaque that was installed on a pedestal outside the Municipal Building.\n\nThe Ridulph family also established a \"Maria Ridulph Memorial Fund\" that was originally used to pay for the memorial map and was later used as a scholarship, compassion and summer camp fund for local children in need. A portion of the proceeds from Charles Lachman's 2014 book about the case, \"Footsteps in the Snow\", was donated to the fund.\n\nAt the time of McCullough's 2012 trial and conviction, the case was the subject of several news documentaries, including an episode of \"48 Hours\" and a CNN Interactive web feature entitled \"Taken: The Coldest Case Ever Solved\". A true crime book by Charles Lachman, \"Footsteps in the Snow\" (2014), also became the basis for a Lifetime Movie Network documentary of the same name. These works, which were published before McCullough's conviction was overturned, presumed that the case had been successfully solved. In contrast, Northern Illinois author Jeffrey Dean Doty self-published a non-fiction book, \"Piggyback\" (2014), in which he reviewed evidence and court filings in the case and examined whether McCullough had been wrongfully convicted.\n\nAs part of his review of McCullough's case, State's Attorney Richard Schmack read \"Taken\", \"Footsteps in the Snow\", and \"Piggyback\", and cited to portions of \"Taken\" and \"Footsteps\" in his 2016 court filing supporting McCullough's innocence.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25698152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25698152", "title": "Old Ephraim", "text": "Old Ephraim\n\nOld Ephraim or Ol' Ephraim is a term popularized in the 19th-century American West to refer to grizzly bears. As well as describing the archetypal grizzly bear, the name has also been used in frontier folklore to refer to specific bears, most notably Old Ephraim (known as \"Old Three Toes\" by sheepherders due to a deformity on one foot), a very large grizzly bear that roamed the Cache National Forest in Idaho and Utah from circa 1911 until his death on August 22, 1923. He was named after another grizzly bear in California described in a story by P. T. Barnum.\n\nThe grizzly bear from the Cache National Forest that eventually became known as \"Old Ephraim\" was first identified by its distinctive tracks. The bear lived within a large wilderness from as far north as Soda Springs, Idaho to as far south as Weber County, Utah, before settling in Logan Canyon, about 20 miles east of Logan, Utah.\n\nFrank Clark (born 1879 in Cherry Creek, Idaho) was a part owner of the Ward Clark Sheep Company since his arrival there in July 1911. During his first summer in the Cache National Forest, Clark counted 154 adult domestic sheep that had been killed by bears in the area.\n\nIn 1914, Frank Clark set out to stop Old Ephraim. He set many traps in Old Ephraim's favorite wallows, but the traps were always removed, un-sprung, or flung away. Although Clark seldom saw the bear, dead sheep around the herd indicated its presence. Despite Clark's efforts, Old Ephraim killed more and more sheep without being stopped. He is said to have once killed 50 sheep at a time.\n\nThough Clark had planned to kill the bear since 1914, he did not succeed until 1923. On the night of August 21, Clark woke to \"a roar and groan\", and took his gun to investigate. At the time, Clark said he was unaware it was Old Ephraim. After several unsuccessful shots, Clark finally found the bear, which had been caught in a trap Clark had set earlier. Clark shot five rounds from a .25-35 carbine rifle but the bear did not go down, so Clark started heading for Logan, about 20 miles away. After about 20 yards he turned around to find the bear being harassed by his dog, so he went closer and shot Old Ephraim in the head. It reportedly took all five rounds to kill the bear. Clark described killing Old Ephraim as \"the hardest of them [the bears] all\". He later expressed remorse for having to do it. \n\nOld Ephraim was skinned and buried, but was later dug up by Boy Scout Troop 43, which sent the bear's skull to the Smithsonian. According to Clark, a pile of stones was erected by Boy Scouts over the bear's remains. Most of the remains were eventually taken by tourists as souvenirs.\n\nLater, an stone monument designed, lettered, and erected by Max Arthur and Howard Jorgensen was placed at the grave site. This memorial was officially dedicated on September 23, 1966. Affixed to the monument are two plaques, one with a poem that reads:\nAt the time of his death, Old Ephraim stood tall and weighed . His skull was sent to The Smithsonian, where it was identified as a grizzly bear. It was eventually returned from the Smithsonian and put on display in the Special Collections section of the Utah State University library in Logan, Utah.\n\nThe Old Ephraim Trail is a popular \"fat tire\" bike trail in the Logan area. It is a 20-mile loop with almost 3,000 feet of vertical gain, and is intended for intermediate or advanced riders.\n\nThe loop starts with several miles of moderate climbing up Cowley Canyon, and proceeds uphill to the upper trailhead of Ricks Canyon. The loop circles north through aspen groves and meadows. After passing Old Ephraim's grave it descends to the Right Fork of Logan River, after which there is one more sizable climb. At the top of this climb, you can see the Mt. Naomi Wilderness and the terraced cliffs of Logan Canyon. The loop ends on the single-track Willow Creek Trail.\n\nThe Bear 100 Mile Endurance Run, starting in the Logan area and ending in Fish Haven, Idaho, is a 100-mile ultramarathon through the Wasatch and Bear River Ranges. Though considered one of the most difficult 100-mile races, it is also considered one of the most scenic, taking advantage of the fall foliage of September. Male and female overall winners receive the Old Ephraim award.\n\nA lifesize bronze statue of Old Ephraim stands along U.S. Route 89 (Washington Street) as it enters Montpelier, Idaho from the west.\n\n"}

In 1722, he married Lucy Wainwright. In 1730, he purchased a 17th-century title to a large tract of land in Nova Scotia with the intent of establishing a colony there; the title did not stand up when he proposed this plan to the authorities in England. A one-time business partner of Colonel Thomas Westbrook, Waldo acquired a large tract of land between the Penobscot and Muscongus Rivers in what is now Maine where he settled Irish and German immigrants.\n\nDuring King George's War, he served as brigadier-general in the attack on Fortress Louisbourg in 1745 and served on the temporary council that administered the settlement until Peter Warren was named governor. In 1757, during the French and Indian War, he submitted a plan to William Pitt which served as a basis for the second capture of Louisbourg from the French the following year. Waldo died of apoplexy near present-day Bangor, Maine in 1759 while participating in a military expedition with Governor Thomas Pownall.

{"id": "1835277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835277", "title": "Slitheen", "text": "Slitheen\n\nThe Slitheen are a family of massive, bipedal extraterrestrials from the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\" and are adversaries of the Ninth Doctor and later Sarah Jane Smith. The Slitheen are of the egg-laying calcium-based Raxacoricofallapatorian race native to Raxacoricofallapatorius, though many use \"Slitheen\" in referring to the race in general. Instinctive hunters trained to kill at a young age, Slitheen are a ruthless criminal sect whose main motivation is profit. They are also convicted on their home world, not willing to return to their planet due to a death sentence.\n\nThe Slitheen first appeared in the 2005 series episodes \"Aliens of London\" and \"World War Three\", and subsequently recur in later episodes of both \"Doctor Who\" and spin-off series \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\".\n\nAdult Slitheen are tall, rather fat with long forearms, powerful claws, and infantile face. They do not appear to have eyelids, but have a nictitating membrane. They have a highly developed sense of smell, able to track a single target across a few city blocks, smell adrenaline and hormones in people, and can sense if one of their own dies. Female Raxacoricofallapatorians can produce poisons within their bodies to use against their enemies. Known methods of delivery include a poisoned dart that is formed in the finger and then fired, and exhalation of poisoned breath. Members of the Slitheen family have green skin, though there is variation in the skin tone of other Raxacoricofallapatorian families. In \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" episode \"The Gift\", members of the Slitheen-Blathereen family group are seen to have orange skin.\n\nThe Slitheen disguise themselves by fitting into the skins of their victims, using compression fields created by a collar worn around their necks to squeeze their huge size into a slightly smaller space. Initially the compression ratio was limited, so the disguises tended to be obese people. This issue was overcome by new technology by the time of \"The Lost Boy\", in which the skins of thinner people were used (by the time of \"From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love\" short people could also be used). The exchange of gases that compression entails also builds up within the acquired skin, causing very loud flatulence in humans (the expelled gas smells like bad breath, which the Doctor noted was a form of calcium decay—though, in reality, bacteria that cause tooth decay are different from those that cause bad breath). This side-effect is also overcome by the newer technology in \"The Lost Boy\".\n\nWhen the Slitheen are in their skin suits they fart loudly; they call this the gas exchange.\nThis can also be caused by over-eating. In \"The Gift\", Sarah Jane and the gang destroy the food, a plant called Rackweed, which is native to Raxacoricofallapatorius, The rackweed which has been digested sits in their stomachs and when Mr Smith triggers a sound in the attic it causes them to start farting and then their stomachs start to move and then their stomachs explode covering everyone and everything in orange goo. Clyde then says that they farted themselves to death. This is due to the fact that the communication that the rackweed had with the wailing sound was interrupted with the sound Mr smith had made, when he linked up to all devices capable of emitting such a sound.\n\nRaxacoricofallapatorians are vulnerable to acetic acid, which reacts explosively—and fatally—with their bodies, making Slitheen allergic to vinegar, ketchup and Coca-Cola. One of the Raxacoricofallapatorian methods of execution is the lowering of the condemned into a cauldron of acetic acid, which is then heated to boiling. The acidity of the solution is formulated to dissolve the skin, allowing the internal organs to drop into the liquid while the condemned is still alive, reducing them to \"soup\" in a slow and painful death. In \"World War Three\", when a single Slitheen was electrocuted, the effects were transmitted to other Slitheen, even those across the city.\n\nWhen they first appeared in \"Aliens of London\" (set in 2006), the Pasameer-Day branch of the Slitheen had been in Great Britain for some time, having infiltrated various levels of British society, from community leaders and military personnel to mid-level politicians and government officials. Their intent was to instigate World War III and sell the radioactive remains of Earth to a depressed galactic economy as fuel for interstellar spacecraft. They staged the crash landing of an alien spaceship in central London, setting up a cybernetically augmented pig as an \"extraterrestrial\" body.\n\nWith the world in a state of heightened alert and panic, and with their commander Jocrassa assuming the role of Acting Prime Minister, they persuaded the United Nations to allow the United Kingdom to use its nuclear arsenal against the alien \"massive weapons of destruction\". Before the Slitheen could receive the launch codes, the Ninth Doctor arranged for a Harpoon missile to demolish 10 Downing Street, ending the scheme and killing all but one of them who managed to escape through an emergency teleport.\n\nBlon Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen, who had assumed the identity of Margaret Blaine of MI5, survived and appeared in the episode \"Boom Town\". In the intervening six months, \"Blaine\" was elected as Lord Mayor of Cardiff and planned to leave Earth by using the energy from a new nuclear power station to interact with the Cardiff Rift, unconcerned that the planet would be destroyed in the process. Blon was stopped by the Doctor and his companions, and on exposure to the \"heart\" of the TARDIS, regressed to an egg. The Doctor took the egg to the hatcheries on Raxacoricofallapatorius so she could be given a second chance at life.\n\nSome years after the events of \"World War Three\", in \"Revenge of the Slitheen\" (set in either 2008 or 2009) another group of Slitheen infiltrated a construction company with plans to turn off the Sun and destroy Earth by draining the world's energy to avenge the deaths of the Pasameer-Days. It is mentioned that the Judoon have begun to force out the Slitheen, and the various other families have been working against them. The families Blathereen and Hostrazeen are mentioned as part of the Raxacoricofallapatorian ruling bodies, the Senate and the Grand Council. After Commander Glune was killed by Maria Jackson, Luke Smith was able to trick the Slitheen into resetting their machinery, which then malfunctioned and exploded. Two of the remaining Slitheen were killed, and the others escaped, including Korst, the first child Slitheen to appear.\n\nThe Slitheen returned in \"The Lost Boy\" where, using the newer compression technology, two Slitheen named Dax and Bloorm posed as Luke's 'real' parents Jay and Heidi Stafford. They were under the command of Korst from \"Revenge of the Slitheen\", who planned to avenge the deaths of his family. Another shorter adult Slitheen appeared in the 2009 \"From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love\", masquerading as a galactic diplomat in an attempt to steal Sarah Jane's robot dog K-9.\n\nThe Slitheen appeared in the New Series Adventures novel \"The Monsters Inside\" by Stephen Cole. When the Ninth Doctor and Rose are arrested in the Justicia System in the year 2501, the Doctor shares a cell with Dram Fel-Fotch and Ecktosca Fel-Fotch Happen-Bar Slitheen, who claim that after the Earth incident, the remnants of the family went bankrupt and had become historians. The Slitheen had not actually given up business, and were in conflict with a more influential family, the Blathereen. When the Doctor and Rose defeat an attempted Blathereen takeover of the system, the Slitheen are pleased to see they can once again become the profit-holders of their race. The Blathereen were mentioned again in the Sarah Jane adventures episode \"Revenge of the Slitheen\".\n\nIn the Series 3 finale of \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\", \"The Gift\", a pair of Slitheen-Blathereen from an intermarried line of the two families attempted to overrun Earth with Rakweed, a plant native to Raxacoricofallapatorius and used as an addictive vegetable.\n\nIn \"Dalek\", a stuffed Raxacoricofallapatorian arm was among a collection of alien artifacts owned by American billionaire Henry van Statten in the year 2012.\n\nRose mentioned the Slitheen Parliament of Raxacoricofallapatorius in \"The Christmas Invasion\" (though her impromptu speech was a pastiche of phrases she's picked up on her travels with the Doctor). A member of the Slitheen was captured by the Graske in the mini-episode \"Attack of the Graske\". Rose accused the Doctor (after his regeneration into the Tenth Doctor) of being a Slitheen in disguise in the and the Doctor makes a passing reference to the Slitheen and their skin-suits in \"The Runaway Bride\".\n\nIn the 2006 series episode \"Love & Monsters\", an alien called the Abzorbaloff, whose natural form is similar to that of the Slitheen, claims to be from Raxacoricofallapatorius's twin planet Clom. The Slitheen space ship from \"Aliens of London\" was also seen in a flashback in the same episode.\n\nA Slitheen appears briefly in the Tenth Doctor novel \"The Nightmare of Black Island\" by Mike Tucker, created from Rose's memories, along with a Dalek and the Nestene Consciousness. The Slitheen are also briefly referenced by the Doctor in the same novel while speaking to a member of the Cynrog about hiding under human-like skinsuits. In the later novel, \"The Last Dodo\", when the Doctor is asked if he's ever had a dream, he claims to have a recurring one in which a Slitheen on a rocking horse chases him.\n\nThe Slitheen appear in John Smith's \"A Journal of Impossible Things\" in the episode \"Human Nature\". The scribbled words by the drawing note that \"it's always for money.\" A Fact File book about the Slitheen has also been released.\n\nIn the \"Torchwood\" episode \"Reset\", a newspaper clipping of Blon posing as Margaret Blaine, previously seen in \"Boom Town\", can be seen as Martha Jones enters the Hub.\n\nThe \"Doctor Who\" website features a segment called Captain Jack's Monster Files, narrated by John Barrowman, which provides information about alien species. An episode focusing on the Slitheen shows a family tree that refers to a number of related families, all with the suffix, \"-een\", with the exception of the 'Absorbalovian Rebels', referring to the Absorbaloff from \"Love & Monsters\", from the twin planet of Clom.\n\nThe Slitheen are mentioned in the audio book \"Wraith World\", when Clyde Langer remarks he cannot understand why Luke and Rani would want to read about made up adventures, when they have faced Slitheen.\n\nThough the Slitheen don't appear in \"The Time of the Doctor\", the Doctor mentions them as among the forces gathered around Trenzalore.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the factors that helped the Doctor determine the home planet of the Slitheen was the fact that they had a hyphenated surname. Examples include the names Blon Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen, and Jocrassa Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen. Additional hyphenated forms in Slitheen names suggest family sub-units within the broader Slitheen family.\n\nThe Slitheen names mentioned in \"Aliens of London\" and \"World War Three\" are:\n\nIn the book \"The Monsters Inside\":\n\nIn \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" story \"Revenge of the Slitheen\":\n\nIn \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" story \"The Lost Boy\":\n\nIndividuals murdered by the family and used as skinsuits include:\n"}

It is observed in certain cnidarians and helminths. This mode of reproduction is characterized by high offspring output, which, in the case of the parasitic tapeworms, is of great significance.\n\n\nIt is to be noted that neck-formation and segmentation are only separated for clarity purposes. In reality, the two processes are simultaneous, with segmentation to release new ephyras occurring at the upper end while neck formation spreads further down the body. Usually, a portion of the animal remains adhered to the substrate and regenerates the body.\n\n\nStrobilation is successfully induced in laboratory conditions by intensive feeding and temperature lowering, and also by the effect of artificial compounds.\n\nIn cestodes, the whole body except for the head and the neck undergoes strobilation continuously, reflecting the important role reproduction plays in the parasitic mode of life. The strobilating section is called strobila, or scolex, and each of its segment is a proglottid. As they mature, proglottids are disposed of in the feces of the host.\n"}
{"id": "423515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=423515", "title": "Switch hitter", "text": "Switch hitter\n\nIn baseball, a switch hitter is a player who bats both right-handed and left-handed, usually right-handed against left-handed pitchers and left-handed against right-handed pitchers.\n\nUsually, right-handed batters hit better against left-handed pitchers and \"vice versa\". Most curveballs break away from batters hitting from the same side as the opposing pitcher, making them harder to hit with the barrel (or \"sweet spot\") of the bat. Additionally, the pitcher's release is farther from the batter's center of vision. In switch-pitcher Pat Venditte's words, \"If I'm pitching right-handed and they're hitting right-handed, it's tougher for them to see. And then, your breaking pitches are going away from their barrel rather than into their barrel.\" Even so, many switch-hitters do better from one side of the plate than the other.\n\nNumerous switch-hitters have achieved a higher batting average on one side, yet have more power from the other. For instance, New York Yankees great Mickey Mantle always considered himself a better right-handed hitter, but hit more home runs left-handed. However, many of Mantle's left-handed home runs were struck at Yankee Stadium, a park notorious for being very friendly to left-handed power hitters due to the short right field porch, and Mantle batted left-handed much more often than right-handed, simply because there have always been more right-handed than left-handed pitchers. Mantle's longest home run, a 565-foot clout in 1953 at Washington's Griffith Stadium, came batting right-handed.\n\nMost switch-hitters have been right-handed throwers, though–among other exceptions–there have been the following players: Lance Berkman, Dave Collins, Doug Dascenzo, Mitch Webster, Wes Parker, Melky Cabrera, Nick Swisher, Justin Smoak, David Segui, Daniel Nava, and J. T. Snow (who, in the final years of his career, hit exclusively left-handed).\n\nSwitch-hitting pitchers are relatively rare. They include Mordecai Brown, Norm Charlton, Marvin Rotblatt, Sid Monge, Johnny Vander Meer, J.C. Romero, Kyle Snyder, Wandy Rodriguez, Troy Patton, Tim Dillard, Tyler Johnson, Carlos Zambrano, Dock Ellis, Vida Blue, Anthony Claggett, Kris Medlen, Justin De Fratus, Drew Storen and Kenley Jansen. Joaquín Andújar sometimes hit right-handed against lefties, sometimes left-handed. Tomo Ohka batted left-handed against right-handed pitchers in three games in 2006, but otherwise batted exclusively right-handed. Left-handed reliever Steve Kline was primarily a switch hitter, but batted right-handed against right-handed pitchers several times throughout his career.\n\nManagement also had a say in the switch-hitting careers of Bob Gibson and Dwight Gooden. Both Gibson and Gooden—each right-handed, and a fine hitting pitcher—had reached the major leagues as a switch-hitter, and both their teams required them to bat only right-handed, to reduce the possibility of their pitching arms being hit by a pitch.\n\nPat Venditte, who played college baseball for the Creighton Bluejays, regularly pitched with both arms. Venditte, drafted by the New York Yankees in 2008, was called up to the Oakland Athletics' major-league roster in 2015. When he opposed switch-hitter Ralph Henriquez while in the minor leagues, Venditte switched his modified glove to his left arm. Henriquez then switched to batting left-handed, and a series of changes continued for several minutes. This prompted the PBUC (Professional Baseball Umpire Corporation) to issue rules about switch-pitching: switch-pitchers must choose which way they will begin pitching before they start. Then, batters will select the side of home plate from which they will hit. The batter and the pitcher are each allowed one switch during the plate appearance, after the first pitch is thrown.\n\n\nIn boxing and mixed martial arts, switch-hitting refers to the ability to change boxing stances mid-fight between an orthodox stance (Right-handed preference straight and left-handed preference jab) and a southpaw stance (Left-handed preference straight and right-handed preference jab).\n\nThe term switch hitting in cricket is used to describe a move in which the batsman changes stance during the bowlers run-up or shortly after the ball is bowled. The move was first done by Kevin Pietersen, and he attributed his own success in executing the move by having strong wrists from playing tennis, hockey and squash, and likened it to playing a backhand shot with the right hand. It also ties into the reverse sweep, which also involves the bat being extended to the non-dominant hip without changing stances with their leg, i.e. for Glenn Maxwell to play a reverse sweep, his left leg stays in front of the right. David Warner, who is normally a left-handed batsman, had practised batting right-handed in his youth, so he is able to switch his batting hand before the bowler's run-up as well. He also bowls with his right arm.\n\n"}

It can happen during childbirth, sexual assault, and accidental occurrences.\n\nThis injury often consists of bruising. But in some cases, severe hemorrhage can be a concern that requires immediate medical attention. In adults, the vagina is largely protected from trauma due to the protective function of the mons pubis and labia majora. This protection is lacking in girls who lack a protective fat layer to protect the vagina. Vaginal trauma can occur when something is inserted into the vagina, for example, a sharp object causing penetrating trauma. Vaginal trauma can occur as a result of a painful sexual experience or sexual abuse. Vaginal trauma can occur in children as a result of a straddle injury. Most of these, though distressing, are not serious injuries.\n\nIn some instances, a severe injury occurs and requires immediate medical attention. Especially if the bleeding won't stop. Vaginal trauma also occurs during an episiotomy and vaginal childbirth. Avoiding vaginal injuries during childbirth will help to prevent depression, hospital readmissions, perineal pain. While also promoting pelvic floor strength, sexual function, and good care for the infant.\n\nSigns and symptoms include:\nabdominal pain,\nbleeding,\nbruising,\nfaintness,\nvaginal discharge,\nembedded object in the vagina,\ngenital pain,\nswelling,\nvomiting,\npainful urination,\ninability to urinate,\npresence of a wound,\nreport of sexual abuse, and\nblood in the urine. A hematoma can form after vaginal trauma. Imaging can identify the presence of the accumulated blood.\n\nDuring childbirth, vaginal or cervical injuries can occur and will likely require surgery to correct them. The vagina is sometimes injured during the course of labor and perineal tears extend from the vagina to various points of the perineum.\n\nNon-obstetric causes include:\nsexual assault,\nfracture of the pelvis,\nforeign object inserted into the vagina,\njet ski and water-skiing accidents.\n\nRisk factors include:\nfirst episode of consensual intercourse,\n￼￼ breastfeeding,\n￼￼ menopause,\nand medication side effects.\n\nA safe environment can be created for young children in addition to keeping small objects out of reach.\n\nTreatment begins with a thorough assessment. The presence of someone to provide support during the examination is very beneficial. Such support is especially prioritized in cases of vaginal trauma due to sexual assault. A support person provides emotional support and can help minimize the risk of re-traumatization. Those treating victims employ sexual assault nurse/forensic examiners (SAN/FEs) with specific training to care for those who have experienced rape or sexual assault. They are able to conduct a focused medical-legal exam. If such a trained clinician is not available, the emergency department has a sexual assault protocol that has been established for treatment and the collection of evidence.\n\n"}

Plants such as some Iridaceae and Agavoideae grow cormlets in the axils of their inflorescences. These fall and in favourable circumstances they have effectively a whole season's start over fallen seeds. Similarly, some Crassulaceae, such as Bryophyllum, develop and drop plantlets from notches in their leaves, ready to grow. Such production of embryos from somatic tissues is asexual vegetative reproduction that amounts to cloning.\n\nAgain, in some species of mangroves, for instance, the seed germinates and grows from its own resources while still attached to its parent. Seedlings of some species are dispersed by currents if they drop into the water, but others develop a heavy, straight taproot that commonly penetrates mud when the seedling drops, thereby effectively planting the seedling. This contrasts with the examples of vegetative reproduction mentioned above, in that the mangrove plantlets are true seedlings produced by sexual reproduction.\n\nIn some trees, like jackfruit, some citrus, and avocado, the seeds can be found already germinated while the fruit goes overripe; strictly speaking this condition cannot be described as vivipary, but the moist and humid conditions provided by the fruit mimic a wet soil that encourages germination. However, the seeds also can germinate under moist soil.\n\nVivipary includes reproduction via embryos, such as shoots or bulbils, as opposed to germinating externally from a dropped, dormant seed, as is usual in plants;\n"}

It holds regular international meetings on dying and death.\n\nThe World Federation, founded in 1980, consists of 45 right to die organizations from 25 countries. The Federation provides an international link for organizations working to secure or protect the rights of individuals to self-determination at the end of their lives.\n\nWorld Right to Die Day is celebrated November 2 in countries such as France, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, and Venezuela. The celebration was founded in France at the WF Conference in 2008 and has since spread. The participating countries vary in their customs of celebration. This day also falls in with the celebration of Dia De Los Muertos in Mexico and is represented in the bigger cities as part of their celebration.\n\nCases of people choosing assisted suicide programs has been met with some controversy in the media and public. One famous case is that of Brittany Maynard. She was diagnosed with a terminal brain cancer and chose to end her life, but before that she chose to speak out about her situation and her choice, thus opening up the debate about the right-to-die movement in America.\n\nControversy also lies in issues regarding whether or not the right to die should be granted to those who are in a Minimally Conscious State (MCS). MCS refers to people who have suffered neurological damage and will never fully recover, but still have some awareness.\n\nGroups, such as The National Right to Life Committee, fight against the movement to legalize and promote the right to die. Their goal is to prevent the determination of handicapped and senior individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The March was intended to rise worldwide awareness for nonviolence. Concrete demands of the March are: abolition of nuclear weapons; withdrawal of invading troops from occupied territories; the progressive and proportional reduction of conventional weapons; the signing of non-aggression treaties among nations and the renunciation by governments of war as a way to resolve conflicts.\n\nThe World March for Peace and Nonviolence is projected to include millions of individuals, on six continents in 90 countries, traveling some 160,000 kilometers.\n\n\nOne of the key strategies to promote the March is to receive endorsements from as many celebrated personalities as possible in a variety of fields. These include: Nobel Prize winners, national presidents, sportsmen and women, actors and actresses, singers, composers etc.\n\nAmongst this list are:\n\n"}
