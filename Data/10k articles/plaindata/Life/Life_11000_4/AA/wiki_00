Mar Addai, the traditional apostle of Mesopotamia, appointed him his successor shortly before his death. Like Addai before him, Aggai preached in various regions of the East.\n\nBrief accounts of the life of Aggai are given in the \"Ecclesiastical Chronicle\" of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (\"floruit\" 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), Amr (14th-century) and Sliba (14th-century). These accounts differ slightly, and these minor differences are of significance for scholars interested in tracing the various stages in the development of the legend.\n\nThe following account of the life of Aggai is given by Bar Hebraeus:\nAfter Addai the preacher of the gospel, his disciple Aggai. This man used to weave Chinese cloth for Abgar, and after the death of his master Addai fled into the East. He began to preach throughout Persia, Assyria, Armenia, Media, Babylonia and in the region of Khuzistan and among the Geles, right up to the borders of India. Then he returned to Edessa, as he was afraid that the faith there might decline, because of the native superstition of Abgar's son, who had succeeded him as king. When he reached Edessa, Abgar's son ordered him to weave Chinese cloth for him as he used to do for his father. Aggai replied to him, 'When my master was feeding the flock of Christ, I used to work for your father. But now the work of feeding has descended to me, and I cannot follow another trade.' The native ruler was angry at his words, and killed him by breaking his leg bones.\nAccording to another tradition, Aggai is said to have been murdered in church by one of the sons of King Abgar V of Edessa. Shortly before his death, Aggai is reported to have appointed Palut as his successor.\n\n\n\n"}

He was nicknamed Axlar-Björn, which translates as \"Shoulder-Bear\" in Icelandic.\n\nAxlar-Björn was the youngest of three children born to an Icelandic farmer couple in 1555. According to legend, Axlar-Björn's mother Sigríður had a craving for human blood during her pregnancy and her husband indulged her by letting her drink his own blood. Sigríður also said that she had terrible nightmares during the pregnancy, making her fear that she was carrying a monster. Axlar-Björn was an unruly and difficult child but otherwise normal.\n\nWhen he was 15-years old, Axlar-Björn began to help in the farm of a rich neighbor named Ormur in exchange for room and board. One day, he took a nap instead of going to mass. He dreamed that a stranger came to him and offered him meat to eat. Axlar-Björn found the meat delicious, but when he had eaten nineteen pieces of meat, he suddenly felt sick and stopped eating. The stranger then told him to climb the mountain Axlarhyrna where he would find an object that would make him famous. The next day, Axlar-Björn climbed the mountain and found an axe at the top. As per his later confession, Axlar-Björn used the axe to kill another 15-year-old farmboy and buried him in the dung heap.\n\nOrmur died some years later from natural causes and left his estates to his son, Guðmundur. Guðmundur had become friends with Axlar-Björn during his employment, and gifted him a farm called Öxl in the Stadarsveit region of Snæfellsnes. Axlar-Björn took residence there with his wife, Þórdís.\n\nThe accounts differ on the motives, modus, number of victims, and events that led to the arrest of Axlar-Björn. Two numbers of victims, nine and eighteen, are the most common claims. The victims were travellers and farmhands that came to Öxl looking for work; some versions say that he hacked them with the axe and others that he drowned them. Local suspicions about Axlar-Björn grew as people disappeared in the area while his horses and other possessions increased, but he was safe because of the protection given to him by Guðmundur. Per one account, the final alarm was raised when a poor woman and her three children sought shelter in the farm. Axlar-Björn lured away, and murdered the children one by one, but the mother escaped and reported him.\n\nAxlar-Björn was arrested and confessed to nine murders, but authorities found more bodies when they searched his farm. Asked about them, Axlar-Björn claimed that he had found the remains buried in his land and decided to rebury them in another place without notifying authorities or bringing them to a cemetery. The authorities did not believe this explanation.\n\nA þing sentenced Axlar-Björn to die by hanging followed by breaking on the wheel. After his death, his body was dismembered and each piece put on a stake. Þórdís, who was pregnant at the time, was forced to watch the execution, and at the end had the amputated genitals of her husband thrown over her lap.\n\nÞórdís was accused of assisting her husband in the murders and even of committing some of the murders herself. She was also sentenced to death, but the execution was not carried out. The son she was carrying, Sveinn \"Skotti\" Björnsson, grew up to be a vagrant and a criminal, and was hanged for rape in 1648. After Sveinn's own son, Gísli \"Hrokur\" Sveinnsson, also became a criminal and was executed, there was speculation that Axlar-Björn's evil had been inherited by his descendants.\n\n"}
{"id": "4111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4111", "title": "Bioleaching", "text": "Bioleaching\n\nBioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms. This is much cleaner than the traditional heap leaching using cyanide. Bioleaching is one of several applications within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to recover copper, zinc, lead, arsenic, antimony, nickel, molybdenum, gold, silver, and cobalt.\n\nBioleaching can involve numerous ferrous iron and sulfur oxidizing bacteria, including \"Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans\" (formerly known as \"Thiobacillus ferrooxidans\") and \"Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans \" (formerly known as \"Thiobacillus thiooxidans\"). As a general principle, Fe ions are used to oxidize the ore. This step is entirely independent of microbes. The role of the bacteria is the further oxidation of the ore, but also the regeneration of the chemical oxidant Fe from Fe. For example, bacteria catalyse the breakdown of the mineral pyrite (FeS) by oxidising the sulfur and metal (in this case ferrous iron, (Fe)) using oxygen. This yields soluble products that can be further purified and refined to yield the desired metal.\n\nPyrite leaching (FeS):\nIn the first step, disulfide is spontaneously oxidized to thiosulfate by ferric ion (Fe), which in turn is reduced to give ferrous ion (Fe):\n\nThe ferrous ion is then oxidized by bacteria using oxygen:\n\nThiosulfate is also oxidized by bacteria to give sulfate:\n\nThe ferric ion produced in reaction (2) oxidized more sulfide as in reaction (1), closing the cycle and given the net reaction:\n\nThe net products of the reaction are soluble ferrous sulfate and sulfuric acid.\n\nThe microbial oxidation process occurs at the cell membrane of the bacteria. The electrons pass into the cells and are used in biochemical processes to produce energy for the bacteria while reducing oxygen to water. The critical reaction is the oxidation of sulfide by ferric iron. The main role of the bacterial step is the regeneration of this reactant.\n\nThe process for copper is very similar, but the efficiency and kinetics depend on the copper mineralogy. The most efficient minerals are supergene minerals such as chalcocite, CuS and covellite, CuS. The main copper mineral chalcopyrite (CuFeS) is not leached very efficiently, which is why the dominant copper-producing technology remains flotation, followed by smelting and refining. The leaching of CuFeS follows the two stages of being dissolved and then further oxidised, with Cu ions being left in solution.\n\nChalcopyrite leaching:\nnet reaction:\n\nIn general, sulfides are first oxidized to elemental sulfur, whereas disulfides are oxidized to give thiosulfate, and the processes above can be applied to other sulfidic ores. Bioleaching of non-sulfidic ores such as pitchblende also uses ferric iron as an oxidant (e.g., UO + 2 Fe ==> UO + 2 Fe). In this case, the sole purpose of the bacterial step is the regeneration of Fe. Sulfidic iron ores can be added to speed up the process and provide a source of iron. Bioleaching of non-sulfidic ores by layering of waste sulfides and elemental sulfur, colonized by \"Acidithiobacillus\" spp., has been accomplished, which provides a strategy for accelerated leaching of materials that do not contain sulfide minerals.\n\nThe dissolved copper (Cu) ions are removed from the solution by ligand exchange solvent extraction, which leaves other ions in the solution. The copper is removed by bonding to a ligand, which is a large molecule consisting of a number of smaller groups, each possessing a lone electron pair. The ligand-copper complex is extracted from the solution using an organic solvent such as kerosene:\n\nThe ligand donates electrons to the copper, producing a complex - a central metal atom (copper) bonded to the ligand. Because this complex has no charge, it is no longer attracted to polar water molecules and dissolves in the kerosene, which is then easily separated from the solution. Because the initial reaction is reversible, it is determined by pH. Adding concentrated acid reverses the equation, and the copper ions go back into an aqueous solution.\n\nThen the copper is passed through an electro-winning process to increase its purity: An electric current is passed through the resulting solution of copper ions. Because copper ions have a 2+ charge, they are attracted to the negative cathodes and collect there.\n\nThe copper can also be concentrated and separated by displacing the copper with Fe from scrap iron:\n\nThe electrons lost by the iron are taken up by the copper. Copper is the oxidising agent (it accepts electrons), and iron is the reducing agent (it loses electrons).\n\nTraces of precious metals such as gold may be left in the original solution. Treating the mixture with sodium cyanide in the presence of free oxygen dissolves the gold. The gold is removed from the solution by adsorbing (taking it up on the surface) to charcoal.\n\nSeveral species of fungi can be used for bioleaching. Fungi can be grown on many different substrates, such as electronic scrap, catalytic converters, and fly ash from municipal waste incineration. Experiments have shown that two fungal strains (\"Aspergillus niger, Penicillium simplicissimum\") were able to mobilize Cu and Sn by 65%, and Al, Ni, Pb, and Zn by more than 95%. \"Aspergillus niger\" can produce some organic acids such as citric acid. This form of leaching does not rely on microbial oxidation of metal but rather uses microbial metabolism as source of acids that directly dissolve the metal.\n\nExtractions involve many expensive steps such as roasting, pressure oxidation, and smelting, which require sufficient concentrations of elements in ores and are environmentally unfriendly. Low concentrations are not a problem for bacteria because they simply ignore the waste that surrounds the metals, attaining extraction yields of over 90% in some cases. These microorganisms actually gain energy by breaking down minerals into their constituent elements. The company simply collects the ions out of the solution after the bacteria have finished. There is a limited amount of ores.\n\n\n\nAt the current time, it is more economical to smelt copper ore rather than to use bioleaching, since the concentration of copper in its ore is in general quite high. The profit obtained from the speed and yield of smelting justifies its cost. Nonetheless, at the largest copper mine of the world, Escondida in Chile the process seems to be favorable.\n\nHowever, the concentration of gold in its ore is in general very low. In this case, the lower cost of bacterial leaching outweighs the time it takes to extract the metal.\nEconomically it is also very expensive and many companies once started can not keep up with the demand and end up in debt. Projects like Finnish Talvivaara proved to be environmentally and economically disastrous.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "289406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=289406", "title": "Blood sugar level", "text": "Blood sugar level\n\nThe blood sugar level, blood sugar concentration, or blood glucose level is the amount of glucose present in the blood of humans and other animals. Glucose is a simple sugar and approximately 4 grams of glucose are present in the blood of a human at all times. The body tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis. Glucose is stored in skeletal muscle and liver cells in the form of glycogen; in fasted individuals, blood glucose is maintained at a constant level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle.\n\nIn humans, glucose is the primary source of energy, and is critical for normal function, in a number of tissues, particularly the human brain which consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasted, sedentary individuals. Glucose can be transported from the intestines or liver to other tissues in the body via the bloodstream. Cellular glucose uptake is primarily regulated by insulin, a hormone produced in the pancreas.\n\nGlucose levels are usually lowest in the morning, before the first meal of the day, and rise after meals for an hour or two by a few millimoles.\nBlood sugar levels outside the normal range may be an indicator of a medical condition. A persistently high level is referred to as hyperglycemia; low levels are referred to as hypoglycemia. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia from any of several causes, and is the most prominent disease related to failure of blood sugar regulation. There are different methods of testing and measuring blood sugar levels.\n\nThe intake of alcohol causes an initial surge in blood sugar, and later tends to cause levels to fall. Also, certain drugs can increase or decrease glucose levels.\n\nThe international standard way of measuring blood glucose levels is in terms of a molar concentration, measured in mmol/L (millimoles per litre; or millimolar, abbreviated mM). In the United States, Germany and other countries mass concentration is measured in mg/dL (milligrams per decilitre).\n\nSince the molecular weight of glucose CHO is 180, the difference between the two units is a factor of 18, so that 1 mmol/L of glucose is equivalent to 18 mg/dL.\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Many factors affect a person's blood sugar level. The body's homeostatic mechanism of blood sugar regulation (known as glucose homeostasis), when operating normally, restores the blood sugar level to a narrow range of about 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L (79 to 110 mg/dL) (as measured by a fasting blood glucose test).\n\nThe normal blood glucose level (tested while fasting) for non-diabetics, should be between 3.9 and 7.1 mmol/L (70 to 130 mg/dL). The mean normal blood glucose level in humans is about 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL); however, this level fluctuates throughout the day. Blood sugar levels for those without diabetes and who are not fasting should be below 6.9 mmol/L (125 mg/dL). The blood glucose target range for diabetics, according to the American Diabetes Association, should be 5.0–7.2 mmol/l (90–130 mg/dL) before meals, and less than 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) after meals (as measured by a blood glucose monitor).\n\nDespite widely variable intervals between meals or the occasional consumption of meals with a substantial carbohydrate load, human blood glucose levels tend to remain within the normal range. However, shortly after eating, the blood glucose level may rise, in non-diabetics, temporarily up to 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) or slightly more. For people with diabetes maintaining 'tight diabetes control', the American Diabetes Association recommends a post-meal glucose level of less than 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) and a fasting plasma glucose of 3.9 to 7.2 mmol/L (70–130 mg/dL).\n\nThe actual amount of glucose in the blood and body fluids is very small. In a healthy adult male of 75 kg with a blood volume of 5 liters, a blood glucose level of 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) amounts to 5g, equivalent to about a teaspoonful of sugar. Part of the reason why this amount is so small is that, to maintain an influx of glucose into cells, enzymes modify glucose by adding phosphate or other groups to it.\n\nIn general, ranges of blood sugar in common domestic ruminants are lower than in many monogastric mammals. However this generalization does not extend to wild ruminants or camelids. For serum glucose in mg/dL, reference ranges of 42 to 75 for cows, 44 to 81 for sheep, and 48 to 76 for goats, but 61 to 124 for cats; 62 to 108 for dogs, 62 to 114 for horses, 66 to 116 for pigs, 75 to 155 for rabbits, and 90 to 140 for llamas have been reported. A 90 percent reference interval for serum glucose of 26 to 181 mg/dL has been reported for captured mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), where no effects of the pursuit and capture on measured levels were evident. For beluga whales, the 25–75 percent range for serum glucose has been estimated to be 94 to 115 mg/dL. For the white rhinoceros, one study has indicated that the 95 percent range is 28 to 140 mg/dL. For harp seals, a serum glucose range of 4.9 to 12.1 mmol/L [i.e. 88 to 218 mg/dL] has been reported; for hooded seals, a range of 7.5 to 15.7 mmol/L [i.e. about 135 to 283 mg/dL] has been reported.\n\nThe body's homeostatic mechanism keeps blood glucose levels within a narrow range. It is composed of several interacting systems, of which hormone regulation is the most important.\n\nThere are two types of mutually antagonistic metabolic hormones affecting blood glucose levels:\n\nThese hormones are secreted from pancreatic islets which are bundles of endocrine tissues. There are four types of pancreatic islets, alpha (A) cells, beta (B) cells, Delta (D) cells and F cells. Glucagon is secreted from alpha cells, while insulin is secreted by beta cells. Together they regulate the blood-glucose levels through negative feedback, a process where the end product of one reaction stimulates the beginning of another reaction. In blood-glucose levels, insulin lowers the concentration of glucose in the blood. The lower blood-glucose level (a product of the insulin secretion) triggers glucagon to be secreted, and repeats the cycle.\n\nIn order for blood glucose to be kept stable, modifications to insulin, glucagon, epinephrine and cortisol are made. Each of these hormones has a different responsibility to keep blood glucose regulated; when blood sugar is too high, insulin tells muscles to take up excess glucose for storage. Glucagon responds to too low of a blood glucose level; it informs the tissue to produce more glucose. Epinephrine prepares the muscles and respiratory system for activity in the case of a \"fight and flight\" response. Lastly, cortisol supplies the body with fuel in times of heavy stress.\n\nIf blood sugar levels remain too high the body suppresses appetite over the short term. Long-term hyperglycemia causes many long-term health problems including heart disease, cancer, eye, kidney, and nerve damage.\n\nBlood sugar levels above 300 can cause fatal reactions. Ketones will be very high (a magnitude higher than when eating a very low carbohydrate diet) initiating ketoacidosis. Mayo clinic recommends emergency room treatment above 300 mg/dL blood glucose.\n\nThe most common cause of hyperglycemia is diabetes. When diabetes is the cause, physicians typically recommend an anti-diabetic medication as treatment. From the perspective the majority of patients, treatment with an old, well-understood diabetes drug such as metformin will be the safest, most effective, least expensive, most comfortable route to managing the condition. Diet changes and exercise implementation may also be part of a treatment plan for diabetes.\n\nFasting blood glucose levels may be higher than the post meal blood glucose in many of the healthy subjects. Such individuals may be said to have physiological insulin resistance and may develop diabetes mellitus as long term complication. In clinical and laboratory practices, many of the time a healthy normal subject will present a fasting blood glucose value higher than the post meal blood glucose value. This creates confusion since there is a common perception that in blood, postprandial (PP) glucose level should be higher than fasting (F) glucose level. The repeated investigation subsequently yields somewhat similar type of result.\n\nIf blood sugar levels drop too low, a potentially fatal condition called hypoglycemia develops. Symptoms may include lethargy, impaired mental functioning; irritability; shaking, twitching, weakness in arm and leg muscles; pale complexion; sweating; loss of consciousness.\n\nMechanisms that restore satisfactory blood glucose levels after extreme hypoglycemia (below 40 mg/dL) must be quick and effective to prevent extremely serious consequences of insufficient glucose: confusion or unsteadiness and, in the extreme (below 15 mg/dL) loss of consciousness and seizures. Without discounting the potentially quite serious conditions and risks due to or oftentimes accompanying hyperglycemia, especially in the long-term (diabetes or pre-diabetes, obesity or overweight, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, etc.), it is still generally more dangerous to have too little glucose – especially if levels are very low – in the blood than too much, at least temporarily, because glucose is so important for metabolism and nutrition and the proper functioning of the body's organs. This is especially the case for those organs that are metabolically active or that require a constant, regulated supply of blood sugar (the liver and brain are examples). In healthy individuals, blood glucose-regulating mechanisms are generally quite effective, and symptomatic hypoglycemia is generally found only in diabetics using insulin or other pharmacological treatment, and in starvation or severe malnutrition or malabsorption (of various causes), and conditions such as anorexia. Hypoglycemic episodes can vary greatly between persons and from time to time, both in severity and swiftness of onset. For severe cases, prompt medical assistance is essential, as damage to brain and other tissues and even death will result from sufficiently low blood-glucose levels.\n\nGlucose testing in a fasting individual, show comparable levels of glucose in arterial, venous, and capillary blood. But following meals, capillary and arterial blood glucose levels can be significantly higher than venous levels. Although these differences vary widely, one study found that following the consumption of 50 grams of glucose, \"the mean capillary blood glucose concentration is higher than the mean venous blood glucose concentration by 35%.\"\n\nGlucose is measured in whole blood, plasma or serum. Historically, blood glucose values were given in terms of whole blood, but most laboratories now measure and report plasma or serum glucose levels. Because red blood cells (erythrocytes) have a higher concentration of protein (e.g., hemoglobin) than serum, serum has a higher water content and consequently more dissolved glucose than does whole blood. To convert from whole-blood glucose, multiplication by 1.14 has been shown to generally give the serum/plasma level\n\nTo prevent contamination of the sample with intravenous fluids, particular care should be given to drawing blood samples from the arm opposite the one in which an intravenous line is inserted. Alternatively, blood can be drawn from the same arm with an IV line after the IV has been turned off for at least 5 minutes, and the arm has been elevated to drain infused fluids away from the vein. Inattention can lead to large errors, since as little as 10% contamination with a 5% glucose solution (D5W) will elevate glucose in a sample by 500 mg/dL or more. The actual concentration of glucose in blood is very low, even in the hyperglycemic.\n\nTwo major methods have been used to measure glucose. The first, still in use in some places, is a chemical method exploiting the nonspecific reducing property of glucose in a reaction with an indicator substance that changes color when reduced. Since other blood compounds also have reducing properties (e.g., urea, which can be abnormally high in uremic patients), this technique can produce erroneous readings in some situations (5–15 mg/dL has been reported). The more recent technique, using enzymes specific to glucose, is less susceptible to this kind of error. The two most common employed enzymes are glucose oxidase and hexokinase. Average blood glucose concentrations can also be measured. This method measures the level of glycated hemoglobin, which is representative of the average blood glucose levels over the last, approximately, 120 days.\n\nIn either case, the chemical system is commonly contained on a test strip which is inserted into a meter, and then has a blood sample applied. Test-strip shapes and their exact chemical composition vary between meter systems and cannot be interchanged. Formerly, some test strips were read (after timing and wiping away the blood sample) by visual comparison against a color chart printed on the vial label. Strips of this type are still used for urine glucose readings, but for blood glucose levels they are obsolete. Their error rates were, in any case, much higher. Errors when using test strips were often caused by the age of the strip or exposure to high temperatures or humidity. More precise blood glucose measurements are performed in a medical laboratory, using hexokinase, glucose oxidase, or glucose dehydrogenase enzymes.\n\nUrine glucose readings, however taken, are much less useful. In properly functioning kidneys, glucose does not appear in urine until the renal threshold for glucose has been exceeded. This is substantially above any normal glucose level, and is evidence of an existing severe hyperglycemic condition. However, as urine is stored in the bladder, any glucose in it might have been produced at any time since the last time the bladder was emptied. Since metabolic conditions change rapidly, as a result of any of several factors, this is delayed news and gives no warning of a developing condition. Blood glucose monitoring is far preferable, both clinically and for home monitoring by patients. Healthy urine glucose levels were first standardized and published in 1965 by Hans Renschler.\n\nThe fasting blood glucose level, which is measured after a fast of 8 hours, is the most commonly used indication of overall glucose homeostasis, largely because disturbing events such as food intake are avoided. Conditions affecting glucose levels are shown in the table below. Abnormalities in these test results are due to problems in the multiple control mechanism of glucose regulation.\n\nThe metabolic response to a carbohydrate challenge is conveniently assessed by a postprandial glucose level drawn 2 hours after a meal or a glucose load. In addition, the glucose tolerance test, consisting of several timed measurements after a standardized amount of oral glucose intake, is used to aid in the diagnosis of diabetes.\n\nError rates for blood glucose measurements systems vary, depending on laboratories, and on the methods used. Colorimetry techniques can be biased by color changes in test strips (from airborne or finger borne contamination, perhaps) or interference (e.g., tinting contaminants) with light source or the light sensor. Electrical techniques are less susceptible to these errors, though not to others. In home use, the most important issue is not accuracy, but trend. Thus if a meter / test strip system is consistently wrong by 10%, there will be little consequence, as long as changes (e.g., due to exercise or medication adjustments) are properly tracked. In the US, home use blood test meters must be approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration before they can be sold.\n\nFinally, there are several influences on blood glucose level aside from food intake. Infection, for instance, tends to change blood glucose levels, as does stress either physical or psychological. Exercise, especially if prolonged or long after the most recent meal, will have an effect as well. In the typical person, maintenance of blood glucose at near constant levels will nevertheless be quite effective.\n\n\n"}

Built in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia in 1960, she sank off the coast of North Carolina during Hurricane Sandy on 29 October 2012.\n\nThe tall ship was often referred to as HMS \"Bounty\", but was not entitled to the use of the prefix \"HMS\" as she was not commissioned into the Royal Navy. Here \"HMS\" is treated as part of the popular name, and not as a ship prefix.\n\n\"Bounty\" was commissioned by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio for the 1962 film \"Mutiny on the Bounty\". She was the first large vessel built from scratch for a film using historical sources. Previous film vessels were fanciful conversions of existing vessels. \"Bounty\" was built to extrapolated original ship's drawings from files in the British Admiralty archives, and in the traditional manner by more than 200 workers over an 8-month period at the Smith and Rhuland shipyard in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. To assist film-making and carry production staff, her general dimensions were greatly increased resulting in a vessel nearly twice the tonnage of the original. While built primarily for film use, she was fully equipped for sailing because of the requirement to move her a great distance to the filming location.\nTwo other well known reproductions were built at the yard subsequent to \"Bounty\"; \"Bluenose II\" and HMS \"Rose\".\n\n\"Bounty\" was launched on 27 August 1960. Crewed by Lunenburg fishermen and film staff, the vessel sailed via the Panama Canal to Tahiti for filming. \"Bounty\" was scheduled to be burned at the end of the film, but actor Marlon Brando protested, so MGM kept the vessel. After filming and a worldwide promotional tour, the ship was berthed in St. Petersburg, Florida as a permanent tourist attraction, where she stayed until the mid-1980s.\n\nThe ship was also featured in an episode of \"Flipper\" titled \"Flipper and the Bounty\" which aired 11 December 1965.\n\nThe ship was featured in the 1983 film, \"Yellowbeard\", a comedy about pirates starring Graham Chapman, Peter Boyle and many other comedic stars, including Marty Feldman in his final role before suffering a heart attack during production.\n\nIn 1986, Ted Turner acquired the MGM film library and \"Bounty\" with it. The ship was used for promotion and entertainment, and was used during the filming of \"Treasure Island\" with Charlton Heston and Christian Bale in 1989.\n\nIn 1993, Turner donated the ship to the Fall River Chamber Foundation, Inc, which established the Tall Ship Bounty Foundation, Inc to operate the ship for educational \"adventures\" as well as a tourist attraction and celebrity promoter of Fall River, Massachusetts. \"Bounty\" summered in New England waters operating out of the Heritage State Park facilities in Fall River and wintered in Florida operating out of the St. Petersburg Pier.\n\nThe ship was booked to appear in several feature films in the mid-1990s, such as a remake of the 1935 film \"Captain Blood\", starring Errol Flynn, and a film about Anne Bonny, an 18th-century female pirate. Both projects were shelved before production began. The ship was set to appear in the 1997 Steven Spielberg film \"Amistad\", but before her scenes were shot in Newport, Rhode Island, filming of the slave ship rebellion at the beginning of the film was moved to Puerto Rico and California. However, the ship did appear in several documentaries during her eight-year stay in Fall River.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Marlon Brando, star of the 1962 version of \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", showed interest in using the ship for a project in the area of his island in the South Pacific. However, he was surprised at what it cost to operate a ship with a crew on a weekly basis, and he passed on the idea.\n\nWhile under ownership of the Tall Ship Bounty Foundation, the ship went into dry-dock twice and had major improvements to the ships ribs and planks. During the second dry docking, Captain Robin Walbridge decided to permanently remove the copper cladding and in its place applied marine anti-fouling paint to repel the insects that bore into the wood. Due to lack of commitment to long term funding by the private and public sectors, the trustees of the Tall Ship Bounty Foundation, Inc. determined it was time to put the ship up for sale. Due to cash flow problems all the crew's contracts were terminated and volunteers kept a watch over \"Bounty\" at its dock at Heritage State Park. On 15 March 2001, the ship was sold to the HMS Bounty Foundation.\n\nIn 2005, while moored in St. Petersburg, \"Bounty\" was the shooting location of the \"pornographic action-adventure\" film \"Pirates\".\n\nThe ship's declining condition caused the vessel to temporarily lose her Coast Guard license, but \"Bounty\" was restored. The vessel's bottom planking was replaced and repaired as required at the Boothbay Harbor Shipyard in 2002. Moored in her winter home in St. Petersburg, Florida, she again became available for charter, excursions, sail-training, and movies, including \"\" and \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\" In April 2006, \"Bounty\" returned to Boothbay Harbor for further refit including repairs to her forward sections and decks. Following this work, \"Bounty\" was scheduled to repeat the famous voyage of the original \"Bounty\".\n\nDuring the 2006 refit, the ship was virtually rebuilt to make her appearance more similar to that of the original HMS \"Bounty\", and make her more suitable for service as a sail training vessel. Her lower decks were cleared of most of its 18th-century-style furnishings and living spaces, including the Great Cabin, the galley, and the officers' quarters. The color of the ship's hull was changed from ocean-blue to black and dark green.\n\nIn August 2007, \"Bounty\" had just completed a US $3 million restoration and was making a seven-week UK tour prior to embarking on a world tour via South Africa and New Zealand to Pitcairn (home to the original Bounty descendants) and Tahiti. The UK ports tour included a visit to Maryport, Cumbria, the birthplace of mutiny leader Fletcher Christian. On Saturday 12 September 2009, the ship was berthed at Custom House Quay in Greenock, Inverclyde, Scotland. At about 04:10 BST thieves targeted the ship and stole a small sum of cash, several items of clothing with \"Bounty\"s insignia, a survival suit, a book, a life ring and an American flag. The items were later recovered nearby.\n\n\"Bounty\"s owners had offered her for sale since 2010. The ship was for sale as of 2012 for US$4.6 million. In winter of 2012, the ship was in San Juan, Puerto Rico. She took part in the Tall Ships gatherings 2012, and was in Halifax, Nova Scotia in July 2012. On 12 August she was docked at Belfast, Maine. On 3 September, \"Bounty\" sailed from Gloucester, Massachusetts to Eastport, Maine. After a stop at Maine Maritime Academy in Castine, she pulled into Boothbay Harbor for dry dock and maintenance. She was relaunched from the Boothbay Harbor Shipyard on 17 October 2012. \"Bounty\" left Boothbay bound for New York City early 21 October 2012.\n\nOn 25 October 2012, the vessel left New London, Connecticut, heading for St. Petersburg, Florida, initially going on an easterly course to avoid Hurricane Sandy.\n\nThe initial request for Coast Guard assistance was sent in an email by the captain to the vessel's organization. At about 8:45 pm EDT, the organization relayed the request to Coast Guard Sector North Carolina about \"Bounty\"s situation. Shortly thereafter the \"Bounty\" crew activated one of \"Bounty\"s EPIRB beacons. Walbridge had reported the ship was taking on water, and the crew was preparing to abandon ship. Afterwards \"Bounty\" lost electrical power due to water flooding the starboard generator.\n\nThis information was sent to a Coast Guard C-130 rescue airplane crew that was stationed in North Carolina at Raleigh-Durham Airport. The ship's location was given as roughly 90 miles southeast of the Outer Banks in the vicinity of a feature on the ocean floor known as the Hatteras Canyon. The C-130 rescue plane underwent equipment outages on its rescue flight, including its anti-icing system and its weather radar. This caused the pilot (Lieutenant Wes McIntosh) and the co-pilot (Mike Myers) to conduct the search at approximately AMSL in an attempt to locate the vessel visually, around midnight and with poor visibility. Shortly after midnight on 29 October, the stricken vessel was discovered.\n\nThe USCG aircraft made radio contact with John Svendsen, \"Bounty\"s first mate, as the C-130 circled the ship in the early morning hours. \"Bounty\" was listing at about a 45 degree angle on its starboard side. As the C-130 crew radioed instructions to \"Bounty\", the plane circled for hours while preparations were made. Meanwhile, helicopter crews from Elizabeth City were instructed to prepare for a very difficult rescue operation. At 4:45 am, Svendsen radioed to the C-130 that the ship was sinking and the crew needed immediate assistance. McIntosh flew the plane lower and readied his crew to drop life rafts and supplies. With the plane short on fuel, the C-130 dropped liferafts but had to leave the vessel and crew on their own in rough seas and winds. It would be more than an hour until the first Jayhawk helicopter arrived on the scene to begin the dangerous rescue attempt around dawn. One member of the Coast Guard crew received major injuries during the rescue.\n\nVice Admiral Parker, USCG, reported the ship had sunk and fourteen people had been rescued from liferafts by two rescue helicopters. The storm had washed the captain and two crew overboard—one of the latter had made it to a liferaft, but the other two were missing. They wore orange survival suits complete with strobe lights, thus rescuers had some hope of finding them alive. Claudene Christian, one of the two missing crew members and who claimed to be related to HMS \"Bounty\" mutineer Fletcher Christian, was found by the Coast Guard. She was unresponsive, and later pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nThe other missing crew member was long-time captain Robin Walbridge. Raised in Montpelier, Vermont, Walbridge later moved to St. Petersburg, Florida. He was a field mechanic on houseboats who worked his way up to obtaining a 1600-ton license in 1995, when he began working as a \"Bounty\" crew member. Search efforts for Walbridge continued over an area of until they were suspended on 1 November 2012.\n\nA formal investigation into the sinking was ordered by USCG Rear Admiral Steven Ratti on 2 November 2012. An inquiry into the sinking was held in Portsmouth, Virginia from 12 to 21 February 2013; at which it was concluded that Captain Walbridge's decision to sail the ship into the path of Hurricane Sandy was the cause, and the inquiry found this to have been a \"reckless decision\". It was also found that the \"leading cause that contributed to the loss\" of life was the captain's \"decision to order the crew to abandon the ship much too late\". The loss of the ship prompted the USCG to conduct a review of the events and decisions leading to the loss of the ship.\n\n\n\n"}

While it appeared possible that the ship was pulled under by a submarine, a specific submarine could not be identified from among the number of submarines of several nations operating in the general vicinity of the accident site. Moreover, the condition of the ship's recovered trawling equipment was reported by a technical inquiry to not be consistent with a submarine entanglement.\n\nThe motorized fishing vessel (MFV) was built in 1986 by the Bretagne Sud shipyard in Belz. \"Bugaled Breizh\" (Children of Brittany) capsized with five sailors about southwest of Lizard Point, Cornwall on 15 January 2004 at 12h25 UTC. Weather in the area at the time was southwesterly winds of 25-30 knots and 2-3 mile visibility. The ship briefly radioed that it was sinking, and disappeared apparently very quickly; only two bodies of the five sailors were recovered at the time, while a third body was recovered on 10 July 2004 during salvage operations in 90 meters of water depth.\n\nImmediately investigations were started by the French authorities in Quimper. Several explanations were advanced to explain the capsizing including a fishing accident, collision with a surface ship, rock or wreck, the presence of a sandbank, and an accident involving a submarine. In June 2004 the ship was raised for forensic examinations. The fish hold showed a compression due to the water pressure. In the absence of evidence of any ramming, the hypothesis of a collision with a surface ship could be abandoned.\n\nSeveral hours after the sinking an announcement was made by the French Maritime Prefect for the Atlantic that a NATO naval exercise involving submarines was taking place in the area. The Dutch submarine was one of the first ships to reach the site of the sinking and was suspected to be involved in the accident. The British submarine was also suspect as it was sent for repair after the exercises. However, according to authorities \"Dolfijn\" was at least away and the Royal Navy indicated as well that its submarines were not at the site where \"Bugaled Breizh\" sank. Other reports mention that the , the British nuclear attack submarine , and two French nuclear attack submarines, and , were also present in the vicinity. Another submarine noted in the area was . Further, there was apparently a submarine of unknown origin that was observing the NATO maneuvers.\n\nThe hypothesis that \"Bugaled Breizh\" was sunk by an accident with a submarine can explain a number of unusual observations. The ship apparently sank very rapidly, there was no launching of any rescue boat, and the help signal was brief, without giving the coordinates. The trawler line of the ship was drawn out on the port side in contrast to the starboard one. The long cable is also reported to have traces of titanium; it has been proposed that this originates from the surface of a submarine.\n\nNATO documents have been declassified and were released to the French judiciary. The Minister of Defense Michèle Alliot-Marie indicated to the National Assembly that the information she had did not allow her to suspect a submarine as the cause of the accident. She indicated that the British and French authorities had cooperated and provided a list of all their ships and submarines in the area of interest. Also, the titanium issue was considered trivial as titanium dioxide is a common pigment of marine paint including the one used for \"Bugaled Breizh\".\n\nThe report of the French Marine Accident Investigation Office (Bureau d'enquêtes sur les événements de mer or BEAmer) was published on 27 November 2006 and examined a number of possible causes; it rejected the proposition that fishing lines got entangled with a military submarine and concluded that \"the hypothesis that the fishing line got buried in a sandbank is more consistent with the evidence.\" \nHowever, the hypothesis of a fishing accident was received with skepticism by the fishing community. It believed that the governmental BEA — it is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport — tried to avoid a diplomatic incident with the military and its allies. An analysis of the French Institute of Research for the Exploration of the Ocean subsequently rejected the proposition of BEAmer as impossible.\n\nExpert testimony indicated that a nuclear submarine that got entangled in the net of a trawler could pull down a vessel of about 250 tons within 80 seconds.\n\nA recent newspaper article states that an unnamed witness thought that British submarine \"Turbulent\" may have been involved in the ship's sinking. However Judge Brigette Lamy said she agreed with reports that the submarine was in Plymouth at the time.\n\nOn September 9, 2015, the British ministry of Defense Penny Mordaunt recognized that a British submarine caught the trawl of the Irish fishing trawler \"The Karen\" on April 15, 2015, in an incident similar to that of the Bugaled Breizh.\n\nOn 31 July 2008, the judges Richard Foltzer and Muriel Corre, who had been charged with the inquiry into the sinking of \"Bugaled Breizh\", after having received expert testimony, issued a statement that a \"highly probable cause\" that the vessel sank was as a result of an accident with a nuclear attack submarine. However, they were unable to indicate which submarine was involved and indicated also the possibility that the accident may have been caused by the unidentified spy submarine or other technically feasible causes. As such the relatives of the dead sailors and the owner of the ship have not received any compensations.\n\nWhile other causes for the ship's loss are possible, this accident and others with a clearer attribution to nuclear submarines suggest that submarines operating in fishing zones represent a danger to fishing trawlers who when \"catching\" a submarine may be at significant risk of being pulled under. The Celtic League indicates that accidents with submarines may have accounted for the loss of more than 20 motorized fishing vessels since 1970 with the loss of over 150 sailors and demands better communication between the military and the civilian authorities.\n\n\nThe article is in part based on the corresponding article in the French Wikipedia from 23 February 2009\n\n"}

The term derives from the peace imposed on Carthage by Rome. After the Second Punic War, Carthage lost all its colonies, was forced to demilitarize and pay a constant tribute to Rome and could enter war only with Rome's permission. At the end of the Third Punic War, the Romans systematically burned Carthage to the ground and enslaved its population.\n\nThe term refers to the outcome of a series of wars between Rome and the Phoenician city of Carthage, known as the Punic Wars. The two empires fought three separate wars against each other, beginning in 264 BC and ending in 146 BC.\n\nAt the end of the Third Punic War, the Romans laid siege to Carthage. When they took the city, they killed most of the inhabitants, sold the rest into slavery, and destroyed the entire city. There is no ancient evidence for modern accounts that the Romans sowed the ground with salt.\n\nBy extension, a Carthaginian peace can refer to any brutal peace treaty demanding total subjugation of the defeated side.\n\nModern use of the term is often extended to any peace settlement in which the peace terms are overly harsh and designed to accentuate and perpetuate the inferiority of the loser. Thus, after World War I, many (the economist John Maynard Keynes among them) described the Treaty of Versailles as a \"Carthaginian Peace.\"\n\nThe Morgenthau Plan put forward after World War II has also been described as a Carthaginian peace, as it advocated the deindustrialization of Germany. It was intended to severely curb the influence of German power in the region and to prevent its remilitarization, as had occurred after World War I (Remilitarization of the Rhineland). The Morgenthau Plan was dropped in favor of the Marshall Plan (1948–1952), which entailed the rebuilding of Western European infrastructure, particularly in West Germany. \n\nGeneral Lucius D. Clay, a deputy to general Dwight D. Eisenhower and, in 1945, Military Governor of the U.S. Occupation Zone in Germany, would later remark that \"there was no doubt that JCS 1067 contemplated the Carthaginian peace which dominated our operations in Germany during the early months of occupation. This is while the US was following the Morgenthau Plan.\" Clay would later replace Eisenhower as governor and as commander-in-chief in Europe. The Marshall Plan was favored as a revival of the West German economy was considered to be necessary for the recovery of the economy of Europe. West Germany was regarded as a key bulwark against the Eastern Bloc.\n\n\n"}

Found by Lieutenant William Gair in Sevastopol after a year-long siege, he is said to have led British forces to valuable caches of hidden supplies that helped ease starvation among the troops. Gair brought Tom back to England after the war but the cat died soon afterwards. He was stuffed and presented to the Royal United Services Institute. A cat bought in a flea market in the 1950s resides in the collection of the National Army Museum and is sometimes described as being Tom, but there is no proof it is the same cat.\n\nDuring the Crimean War British and French forces captured Sevastopol from the Russians on 9 September 1855 after an almost year-long siege. Lieutenant William Gair of the 6th Dragoon Guards, who was seconded to the Field Train Department as a deputy assistant commissary, led patrols to search the cellars of buildings for supplies. Gair noticed a cat, covered in dust and grime, that was sitting on top of a pile of rubbish between two injured people. The cat, unperturbed by the surrounding commotion, allowed himself to be picked up by Gair. The cat, estimated to have been 8 years old when found, had survived within the city throughout the siege.\n\nGair took the cat back to his quarters and he lived and ate with a group of British officers who initially named him \"Tom\" and later \"Crimean Tom\" or \"Sevastopol Tom\". The occupying armies were struggling to find supplies, especially of food, in a city much-deprived by the year-long siege. It is said that the officers noticed how fat Tom was getting and realised he must have been feeding off a good supply of mice nearby. Knowing that the mice may themselves have been feeding off hidden Russian supplies, they followed Tom to an area cut off by rubble. Here, they found a storeroom with food supplies that helped to save British and French soldiers from starvation. Tom later led the officers to several smaller caches of supplies near the city docks. After the war ended Gair brought Tom back with him to England to keep as a pet but the cat died on 31 December 1856.\n\nGair had Tom stuffed and presented to the Royal United Services Institution. A stuffed cat purchased at the Portobello Road market by Lady Faith Compton Mackenzie in the 1950s was identified as Crimean Tom but there is no proof it is the same cat. It was donated to the National Army Museum in 1958 and is on display there; however, they have not been able to confirm whether or not this is Crimean Tom. \n\nTom has popularly been identified as the cat asleep on a table next to a wood stove in the oil painting \"A Welcome Arrival, 1855\" by John Dalbiac Luard, an 1857 work depicting British officers opening packages sent from home. It has been suggested that Gair is the red-coated figure at the left of the piece. The National Army Museum write, however, that \"there is no evidence to substantiate any of these claims\".\n"}

She enjoyed great popularity and was known for her extravagant costumes.\n\nShe was attracted to the theater at an early age, studying with Louis-Arsène Delaunay and Marie Favart. In 1899, she began her career at the Odéon and then, in 1901, became a member of the Comédie-Française, where she specialized in playing a stock character known as the \"grande coquette\". She was especially well known for her portrayal of Célimène in \"The Misanthrope\". In 1904, she became the 339th \"Sociétaire de la Comédie-Française\" and remained with the theater until 1933.\n\nAlthough long engaged to Whitney Warren, an American architect who was related to the Vanderbilts, she eventually married the Comte de Ségur-Lamoignon, great grandson of the famous Comtesse de Ségur, who acted under the name Guillaume de Sax. They were sometimes mocked as \"beauty and the beast\" and were separated after fifteen years, but she kept the title of \"Comtesse\" for the rest of her life.\n\nIn 1909, she had the starring role in \"La Tosca\", a film by André Calmettes and Charles Le Bargy. Her next film role did not come until 1937, when she played an aged courtesan in \"Pearls of the Crown\" by Sacha Guitry.

It was first published in 1856 as part of the second volume of his \"Années de pèlerinage\" (\"Years of Pilgrimage\"). This work of program music was inspired by the reading of Dante Alighieri's most famous epic poem, the \"Divine Comedy\".\n\nThe \"Dante\" Sonata was originally a small piece entitled \"Fragment after Dante\", consisting of two thematically related movements, which Liszt composed in the late 1830s. He gave the first public performance in Vienna, during November 1839. When he settled in Weimar in 1849, he revised the work along with others in the volume, and gave it its present title derived from Victor Hugo's own work of the same name. It was published in 1858 as part of \"Années de pèlerinage\".\n\nThe piece is divided into two main subjects. The first, a chromatic theme in D minor, typifies the wailing of souls in Hell. D minor is a common key for music relating to death, as evidenced by Liszt's \"Totentanz\" and the statue scene of Wolfgang Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\". The first theme also heavily uses the Tritone (augmented 4th or diminished 5th); this interval was known as the Devil's interval (or \"Devil in music\") and further reinforces the hellish imagery. The second theme is a beatific chorale in F-sharp major, derived from the first, which represents the joy of those in Heaven. The key is also symbolic here, being the signature for other uplifting works of Liszt's, including \"Benediction of God in Solitude\" (part of \"Harmonies poétiques et religieuses\") and \"Les Jeux d'eaux à la Villa d'Este\" (\"Années de pèlerinage\", Vol. 3, No. 4). The secondary theme may also represent Beatrice, as it is interspersed within chromatic areas, similar to the character's appearances in hell. The piece ends with a rapid chromatic octave section that when played at speed seems to split into three distinct themes, reflecting the three heads of Satan in Dante's \"Inferno\".\n\n\n"}

He died in hospital three days later, the seventh death in the Bahraini uprising.\n\nBuhmaid was among a group of protesters who on 18 February marched toward the Pearl Roundabout following the funeral procession of protester Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima, who was killed four days earlier. When the protesters neared Pearl Roundabout, the army opened fire. Buhmaid collapsed to the ground, and blood poured from his head after it was hit by a bullet. The army opened fire twice more. Protesters regrouped after each round of shooting. Riot police finally intervened and dispersed protesters. Over one hundred protesters were injured, some seriously. Buhmaid was taken to Salmaniya hospital where attempts to revive him failed over the course of three days. He died on the afternoon of 21 February.\n\nSeveral witnesses including journalists and medics accused authorities of shooting directly at protesters, preventing some ambulances from reaching the site and firing at others. The government however, denied those statements. It stated that warning shots were fired in the air and accused protesters of faking injuries. An investigation by a government-appointed commission of inquiry blamed the army for Buhmaid's death. The incident marked the first time that the Royal Bahraini Army was used to confront civilians, and at the time was considered \"the bloodiest\" incident since protests erupted.\n\nFollowing the incident, the government offered dialogue which the opposition said they will only take part in after the withdrawal of the army. The general labor union called for a general strike. Internationally, the attack on protesters was condemned by Barack Obama and Human Rights Watch. High Representative of European Union expressed her deep concerns and called for restrain and immediate dialogue. Britain revoked over forty arms licenses to Bahrain after an earlier announcement that it would review them and German president canceled a planned visit to the country. Buhmaid is remembered by the opposition as a martyr, leader and symbol of peacefulness.\n\nBuhmaid (or \"Buhamaid\", 28) was married and had three children. He lived in Malkiya, south west of Manama. According to his wife, he had strong ties with his brothers. In an interview with the Bahraini newspaper \"Al Wasat\", she said he used to take part in any political event in his area. \"He was hoping to be Malkiya's first martyr and so he became\", she added.\n\nInspired by the successful uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, protests erupted in Bahrain on 14 February. During the day named as the Day of Rage, over 6,000 people participated in fifty-five demonstrations and political rallies in twenty-five different locations throughout Bahrain. Security forces responded to protests by firing tear gas, rubber bullets, sound bombs and birdshot. More than thirty protesters were injured and Ali Mushaima died as a result of birdshot injury in his back. The following day, during the deceased funeral, another protester was killed the same way. Angry protesters marched to and occupied Pearl Roundabout. By nightfall, their numbers had swelled to over 10,000. On 16 February, thousands of protesters continued to occupy Pearl Roundabout.\n\nOn 17 February (later referred to as the Bloody Thursday), police launched a pre-dawn raid on sleeping protesters. Four protesters were killed and more than 300 were injured bringing the number of those killed in the events to six. Health workers and a journalist were allegedly attacked by security forces. The army was deployed following clearance of Pearl roundabout which then set up checkpoints and barriers. The Interior Ministry issued a warning to stay off the streets, and the army warned that it was ready to take \"punitive measures\" to restore order. Protesters resorted to Salmaniya Hospital's car parks where thousands of them protested against the government. All 18 Members of Parliament from Al Wefaq, the only opposition political party represented in Parliament, submitted their resignations.\n\nOn 18 February, over 50,000 participated in the funerals of crackdown victims. One was held in Al Daih, another in Karzakan. The largest however, was in Sitra. At about 4:46 in the afternoon, about a thousand protesters, most of them young men who participated in Al Daih funeral of Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima marched toward Manama, defying the government ban on gatherings. By 5:18 they had reached a road junction; to the right was Salmaniya hospital and to the left Pearl Roundabout. They turned left after a short pause. On their way, they clashed with riot police who withdrew from the site. Protesters continued their march removing barriers set by police a day ago.\n\nBy 5:30 protesters were 80 to 200 meters away from army forces stationed in Pearl Roundabout which \"were armed with M16 assault rifles, Dilmun rifles and Browning .50 calibre machine guns mounted on top of armoured vehicles\". The protest was peaceful and protesters were \"holding their hands in the air and chanting 'peaceful, peaceful'\". Some were holding flowers. As protesters continued marching, army troops opened fire.\n\nAbdulredha Buhmaid was among the protesters. He was shot by a bullet in the head, collapsed to the ground and in the words of a witness, \"blood was rushing from his head\". Others sustained severe injuries inflicted by gunshots, two of whom also fell to the ground. Several eyewitnesses said army troops \"gave no warning\", but one witness said he heard them issue a warning several minutes after the initial shooting. Another witness said they heard a \"faint voice of someone over a loudspeaker in the distance but could not make out what the speaker was saying\".\n\nMost protesters ran after hearing gunshots and a helicopter chased them. After shooting stopped, protesters regrouped. One youth picked a rock and headed toward the army, only to be stopped by four other protesters. A witness interviewed by Physicians for Human Rights said that he and other protesters moved closer to army forces following the initial shooting. According to him he asked \"Why do you shoot us? We had our hands up. We are peaceful. What do you want from us?\", one soldier replied \"I want you to leave. If you do not turn back, I have orders to shoot\". Arriving ambulances started evacuating the injured when army opened fire again.\n\nWhen the shooting stopped, about fifty protesters started praying on the road, and few stood in front facing the army with their hands in the air. The army opened fire for a third time. The period of each shooting was short, because \"people immediately started running away\", witnesses said. After that, riot police intervened, firing tear gas and birdshot to disperse protesters, inflicting more injuries among them.\n\nA cameraman working for the Associated Press said he saw \"army units shooting anti-aircraft weapons, fitted on top of armored personnel carriers, above the protesters in apparent warning shots and attempts to drive them back from security cordons\". Bahraini photojournalist Mazen Mahdi said that the army shot \"live fire from machine guns\" and that paramedics were blocked from helping the wounded. \"The first was a warning shot in the air. But after that, they just opened fire at the people ... They shot at the ambulances when they came in\", he added.\n\nA senior emergencies researcher and medics interviewed by Human Rights Watch confirmed that some of the twelve ambulances sent were prevented by security forces from reaching the site. \"The Daily Telegraph\" said ambulances and paramedics \"were shot at\" and that \"several were detained and at least one ambulance was impounded\". Michael Slackman of \"The New York Times\" reported that he and a colleague were \"shot at from a helicopter\" shortly after army opened fire on protesters. Associated Press witnesses, \"The Daily Telegraph\", and \"The New York Times\" mentioned that army personnel positioned in high buildings and helicopters fired on protesters. Jalal Firooz, resigned MP of Al Wefaq, Bahrain's main opposition party, said he saw soldiers fire on protesters. A report by three local rights groups mentioned that \"photos of the injuries suggest that army aimed at the upper body area\".\n\nRiot police chased down protesters who fled to Salmaniya, Bahrain's main hospital. Security forces backed off after initially advancing toward the hospital and firing tear gas into it. That night, over seven thousand protesters staged an anti-government sit-in in hospital parks, described by \"The Guardian\" as \"the only place in Manama where they now feel safe to gather in numbers\". The incident marked the first time that the Royal Bahraini Army was used to confront civilians, and at the time was considered \"the bloodiest\" incident since protests erupted.\n\nAt least 120 people were injured according to medical officials. Salmaniya hospital was \"overwhelmed\" with casualties, some of whom were taken to private hospitals. Doctors said that nine of the thirty-two casualties who reached Salmaniya hospital were in critical condition. Some medics cried while treating the injured, some of whom had bullets still lodged into their bodies, X-rays showed. A doctor interviewed by Al Jazeera English pleaded for help from \"all countries in the world\". Describing the situation in hospital as a war, Dr. Ghassan said, \"They are shooting at people's heads. Not at the legs. People are having their brains blown out\". Two doctors said they treated patients who \"seemed to be [injured by] live bullets rather than shotgun pellets, judging by the entry and exit holes\".\n\nBuhmaid was taken to Salmaniya hospital. Blood was still \"pouring from his head and he was unconscious\". He was \"clinging to life\" in intensive care unit where doctors \"struggled to stop his bleeding\". \"This is a bullet, gunshot wound, direct to his head and he's bleeding profusely from his nose, from his ear, his brain is shattered into pieces\", said a doctor. Buhmaid's \"brain was destroyed, but his body was still alive\". His clinical death prompted a nurse on 20 February to smash a glass-framed image of the Prime Minister. Remaining in ICU for three days, Buhmaid was medically declared to be dead early in the afternoon of 21 February, becoming the seventh victim of the uprising.\n\nListing him under \"Deaths Attributed to Security Forces\", the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry appointed by King Hamad to investigate the events stated that Buhmaid's death \"may be attributed to the BDF [army]\" while also referring to the contrary result of the military investigation.\n\nOn the night of 18 February, Fasial al-Hamar, then the Minister of Health, issued a press release aired on the national TV which denied there had been any deaths. He said the situation at Salmaniya hospital was calm and that only seven people were being treated for minor injuries. He also warned against what he called \"rumors\" spread in some satellite channels and websites. Bahrain's ambassador to the United States said that if army forces did fire live ammunition, \"Probably they were warning shots only\". \"The forces that were used were proportional according to the law, they were legal, they were necessary because they were stopping the shops. The economy was hurting, the national economy. We had to take action and action was taken by the law,\" he added. However he admitted protesters did not use live rounds and promised that \"Investigations will happen. And they will continue\".\n\nThe army said that protesters defied its orders to evacuate the area. According to its statement, after at least fifteen minutes of repeating the same orders, soldiers fired warning shots to the air. It also alleged that protesters were accompanied by \"a line of ambulances\" out of which they took blood bags to \"feign that they had been injured\". Military prosecutors carried out an investigation and concluded that the trajectory of the bullet that killed Buhmaid were inconsistent with the bullet having been shot by the BDF, on the basis of an ordnance expert's report that concluded the shot was fired from a high elevation.\n\nFollowing the incident, the government offered dialogue with opposition and ordered army to withdraw from Pearl Roundabout. On 19 February, army troops were replaced by riot police. Hundreds of protesters moved to the site from different locations. A standoff between protesters and riot police was created, until the latter suddenly moved away. Thousands of protesters re-occupied the site following police withdrawal.\n\nBuhmaid's funeral was held on 22 February in his village, Malkiya. Over 9,000 participated in the funeral procession which started from roundabout 13 in Hamad Town and ended in Malkiya graveyard. At the same day during afternoon, over 100,000 participated in a protest dubbed \"March of loyalty to martyrs\" in honor of the seven victims of the uprising.\n\nIn May 2011, 47 doctors, nurses, and dentists were charged for their actions during the uprising. One of the charges was conducting unnecessary operations to Buhmaid, which led to his death. In a press conference, Minister of Justice said \"Buhmaid was shot in the head and he underwent a surgery in the presence of the media. His head had been open in an exaggerated manner, which led to his death\".\n\nBuhmaid's family said they were sad for his death, but their pride had overcome it. Appearing on the national TV, the crown prince authorized by his father, the king, offered unconditional dialogue with opposition. He offered \"condolences to the people of Bahrain for the painful days they are living\" and asked them to remain calm. Opposition activists demanded withdrawal of army and resignation of government for the dialogue to begin. \"[There is no] serious will for dialogue because the military is in the streets\", said Matar Matar, resigned MP of Al Wefaq. The general labor union called for an indefinite general strike \"unless the army is pulled out from the streets and peaceful demonstrations are permitted\".\n\nBarack Obama criticized the government actions. In reference to government of Bahrain and Yemen, he said \"The United States condemns the use of violence by governments against peaceful protesters in those countries and wherever else it may occur\". Catherine Ashton, the High Representative of European Union demanded \"restraint\" from all parties and said that report of violence \"deeply concerned\" her. She called for dialogue to begin \"without delay\". The United Kingdom revoked forty four arm licenses to Bahrain, twenty of them open licenses. Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said \"We are deeply concerned about the situation in Bahrain and the events which have led to the deaths of several protesters\".\n\nGerman president canceled a planned trip to the country. \"Freedom of assembly and freedom of speech in Bahrain have to be fully guaranteed\", a spokesman quoted him saying. Lawrence Cannon, then Canada's Foreign Minister called the Bahraini government to \"exercise restraint\" and lunch an investigation into protesters' deaths. \"Canada urges Bahrain to respect its citizens' rights to freedom of expression and assembly, and to engage in peaceful dialogue with its people to address their concerns\", he added.\n\nHuman Rights Watch condemned the attack. \"The Bahraini army has done what the Egyptian army did not do and exactly what the United States and its other partners urged it not to do -- it has opened fire on its own people,\" its Washington director said. Fareed Zakaria, CNN's international affairs analyst, said that the crackdown on protesters was a \"rash move that will enrage many of its people and cost the regime international prestige\". \"This is a terrible mistake and they will pay a heavy price for it. The regime in Bahrain is doing something very rash and unwise; it is trying to respond by using force and punitive measures. This is not going to work in the end\", he added.\n\nBuhmaid was the first person named a \"field commander\" by February 14 Youth Coalition, which also named their attempt to reoccupy Pearl Roundabout in the first anniversary of the uprising, \"operation of the martyr leader Abdulredha Buhmaid\". His death was described by the online opposition newspaper, \"Bahrain Mirror\", as a \"legendary scene that will remain forever in the conscience of humanity\". A poster found in two articles of the aforementioned newspaper described Buhmaid as \"the martyr who brought down an army with his peacefulness\".\n\nSpeaking to participants of a sit-in front of United Nations building in Manama on 22 February 2012, Ahlam al-Khuza'e of Al Wefaq said that shooting scene of Buhmaid was \"the top manifestation of peacefulness\". On 29 February, opposition parties organized a gathering in Malkiya to honor Buhmaid. Thousands participated in the gathering including Isa Qassim, Bahrain Shias' top religious figure.\n\n"}

Between 1985 and 1999, in Lille and its suburbs, he raped and killed three girls and raped two boys and another girl. In November 2003, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 29-year lock-in period.\n\nDenis Waxin was born on June 26, 1968 in the Nord, spending his childhood in Wattignies. He never saw his parents talking to each other. His mother Marie-Jeanne was hard-working and decent. On the other hand, his father was very strict, interested only in trifecta and games of chance, and never talked to Denis or his other 4 children. His family was modest, and his parents often left him in silence and isolation, without tenderness and affecition. His older brother Dominique was his only confidant, defender and sole source of sweetness.\n\nIn 1985, Dominique left the family home and Denis fell into depression. Every day he would walk miles in the streets alone for hours. He obtained a professional degree in carpentry, later doing his military service in Germany. During military leave, he had a relationship with an older woman. Their relationship ended in the late summer of 1990 when he finished his military service. Eventually he got married and lived in Moulins. The pair did not have a child, and he called his wife \"mom\". He was described as a good husband, helpful and charming.\n\nHe got a job in the filling station of Auchan in Villeneuve-d'Ascq. He was punctual and conscientious, but unpredictable. One night, he shot all the bullets from the alarm gun charger onto an eyeglass thief. He ended up being fired for threatening to set the station on fire because he was annoyed by a remark made to him by his boss.\n\nHis father died in 2002.\n\nOn November 22, 1985 at the end of the afternoon, at the biscuit district in Lille, 7-year-old Nathalie Hoareau was sent by her mother to buy cigarettes and bread. Waxin approached her and offered to show her his shack. She followed him to a wasteland in the rue de Faubourg Arras (RD 549), where he raped her, tried to strangle her with a candy necklace she wore around her neck before stabbing her twice in the heart. Nathalie's mother reported her disappearance to the police at 6:30 PM. Her body, the lower part of which was bare, was found in the evening in a bush by two policemen. Near her, they found the packets of cigarettes she had bought and the shopping list on which the shopkeeper had written a message for her mother. A trace of sperm was found, but the rain had altered it, making it impossible to establish a genetic profile.\n\nOn October 8, 1990 in the Austerlitz in Wazemmes, Cathy Monchaux, 9 years old, was playing in the garden of her residence. At 8 PM, her father Roger called her to come back home. Waxin then approached her and offered to buy candy, taking her to an old football field turned into a wasteland on Victor-Hugo boulevard. He raped then stabbed her fourteen times because she tried to escape. When Cathy did not return, her father and older sister, Valérie, went out looking for her. Unsuccessful, her father informed the police at 9 PM. A day later, a man walking his dog found Cathy's naked body.\n\nOn July 23, 1992 at the end of the afternoon on Georges-Mandel street in Moulins, Nadjia Thebib, 4 years old, was playing with other children at the foot of a HLM building where her grandmother Meriem lived on the ground floor. Her parents had just separated. Waxin went in the direction of Ronchin. He carried her in his arms, and since she was calm, her family supposed that he was an uncle of Nadjia. Anissa, Nadjia's aunt, pursued him in the streets, but she stumbled and lost sight of him. Nadjia's mother Nina went out looking for her with the help of the other family members. She reported the abduction to the police at 8 PM. Anissa described the kidnapper's outfit: red T-shirt, sneakers with white stripes and white sweatpants with red stripes. A facial composite was produced and broadcast. Meanwhile, Waxin raped Nadjia, stabbing her in the neck and choking her with a plastic bag. On July 29, 1992 at the beginning of the afternoon, in a vacant lot in Ronchin, three boys found Nadjia's body lying on its right side, under a tarpaulin in a hole between the suburbs. Her clothes were folded beneath her. The medical examiner stated that she had been killed a few hours after her abduction. On one of her clothes trace of sperm was found, and this allowed the authorities to establish a DNA profile.\n\nThe investigators were certain that the perpetrator lived in Lille or its suburbs, so well as to know the deserted places and move so quickly and discreetly when abducting a child.\n\nIn November and December 1993 Waxin raped two boys aged 7 and 10 in Moulins and Lambersart.\n\nIn 1998, Waxin was arrested for trying to steal cutlery from a store with his wife.\n\nOn January 6, 1999 on Jean-Jaurès street in Moulins, 6-year-old Wendy, her older sister and brother collected yellow coins at the food at the residence where they lived. After a while, her brother and sister decided to separate to collect more efficiently. Wendy remained alone in asking people who came in and out of the residence entrance, while her brother and sister collected in the residence door to door. Wendy asked Waxin, who was walking down the street. He said he had none on him, but that he had some at home. After checking that no one else is around, he took Wendy by hand and pulled her to the side of the street. They walked for miles. Waxin replied that they have almost arrived each time Wendy asked him if it is far from home. He told her that it is a shortcut and that it took them to an abandoned factory in Fives. She resisted when he began to undress her, but he threatened her with an electric baton, saying that he had already killed other little girls. She no longer protested, letting Waxin undress and rape her. She calmly put her clothes back on when he finished. She left but Waxin followed her, telling her that is watching and he will come back if she speaks to the police. She walked towards her home and found out that she had disappeared. A motorist saw her crying, and carried her to the police station.\n\nWendy's good memory made it possible to create a facial composite. She said that he was wearing a green jacket with a tringle in the back. A few days later, while Wendy was looking out the window, she saw Waxin on the sidewalk in front of the residence, looking at her and smiling. The police, informed a few days later, monitored the building entrance. They noticed a man matching the facial composite. They questioned him, and he claimed that he is a marginal resident in a home near Wendy. The authorities printed on one sheet six anthropometric photos: that of the suspect, and those of five men resembling him. They went to Wendy's house and asked her if she could recognize her attacker among the pictures. She referred to Waxin's photo, who was not considered a suspect. Interlocated, the investigators asked her again and said its him. For them, Waxin was just a small shoplifter, and without a confession, they could not prosecute him.\n\nOn January 20, 1999, Waxin went to the convocation. He was very nervous. The inspectors were impressed by the resemblance to the facial composite. They barely told him the reason for his summoning when he confessed that it is him, then refused to speak further. When he was lined up behind the beam splitter, Wendy formally recognized him. During the search of Waxin's home, the police found in his room the jacket corresponding to Wendy's description. In a pocket of the jacket, authorities found a police baton. On January 28, 1999, Waxin was indicted for rape and unlawful confinement of children under 15. He is currently incarcerated in Loos Prison.\n\nWaxin's DNA profile was compared to that of Nadjia Thebib's aggressor, resulting in an identical match. On July 12, 1999, Waxin was indicted for kidnappy followed by death and rape, accompanied or followed by acts of torture and barbarity on Nadjia. He was extracted from his cell and questioned while in custody. He admitted to having raped, strangled and suffocated Nadjia. He refused to sign his confession and speak further. He declared that he wanted to see the investigating judge to tell him about the murders of the 3 girls.\n\nOn July 13, 1999, in the office of Christophe Ingrain, the investigating judge, Waxin admitted to murdering Nadjia, Cathy Monchaux and Nathalie Hoareau. He claimed to have done this to avenge a rape of which he was victim when he was 12 years old in a cabin in the woods by a homeless man, and that he drank alcohol before committing rape. On July 20, 1999, he was indicted for kidnapping followed by death and rape preceded, accompanied or followed by torture or acts of barbarity on Nathalie and Cathy.\n\nOn July 20, 1999, Waxin wrote a letter to the investigating judge in which he confirmed the confessions made in the office by describing the crimes more precisely. He claimed to have killed the girls so that they won't give birth to a monster like the one who raped them. He confessed to having committed three more rapes on girls, whom he did not kill because they \"were kind\", also admitting to the rapes of two boys in 1993. No trace of the rapes of the other three girls were found in the police files.\n\nIn May 2002, the trial of Denis Waxin began at a cour d'assises in Nord and Douai, for the murders and rapes preceded by torture or acts of barbarity on Nadjia and Cathy, and for the rapes on the 2 boys and on Wendy. The defense of Waxin was provided by lawyer Jean-Yves Moyart. Experts described Waxin as a perverted egocentric whose \"sexualized hatred was from infancy\".\n\nOn May 31, 2002, Denis Waxin was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 30-year lock-in period. He tried to appeal the decision.\n\nOn September 9, 2002, the trial of Denis Waxin for the rape and murder of Nathalie Hoareau began at a cour d'assises of Nord in Douai, because he was 17 years old during these events. Sébastien Degardin was the lawyer for Hoareau's family.\n\nIn September 2002, Waxin was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He tried to appeal this decision as well.\n\nIn 2003, Waxin's appeal trial for the Hoareau murder took place at cour d'assises Pas-de-Calais in Saint-Omer.\n\nHe was again sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nIn 2003, Denis Waxin's appeal trial began at the Pas-de-Calais Assize Court in Saint-Omer. Sobbing, he finally apologized for what he did.\n\nIn November 2003, Denis Waxin was sentenced to life with a 29-year lock-in period.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3049655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3049655", "title": "Diabetes mellitus and pregnancy", "text": "Diabetes mellitus and pregnancy\n\nFor pregnant women with diabetes mellitus some particular challenges exist for both mother and child. If the woman has diabetes as an intercurrent disease in pregnancy, it can cause early labor, birth defects, and larger then average infants.\n\nPlanning in advance is emphasized if one wants to become pregnant and has type 1 diabetes mellitus or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Stringent blood glucose control is needed before pregnancy.\n\nDuring a normal pregnancy, many maternal physiological changes occur and there is an increase in insulin needs due to increased hormonal secretions that regulate blood glucose levels, glucose-'drain' to the fetus, slowed emptying of the stomach, increased excretion of glucose by the kidneys and resistance of cells to insulin.\n\nThe risks of maternal diabetes to the developing fetus include miscarriage, growth restriction, growth acceleration, fetal obesity (macrosomia), mild neurological deficits, polyhydramnios and birth defects.In some studies 4% to 11% of infants born to type 1 diabetic women had defects compared to 1.2% to 2.1% of infants born in the general population.The cause is, e.g., oxidative stress, by activating protein kinase C that leads to apoptosis of some cells. A hyperglycemic maternal environment has also been associated with neonates that are at greater risk for development of negative health outcomes such as future obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome. \n\nDuring the first trimester, besides increased birth defect risks, having a miscarriage is also increased due to abnormal development in the early stages of pregnancy. \n\nWhen blood glucose is not controlled, shortly after birth, the infant's lungs may be under developed and can cause respiratory problems. Hyperglycemia can occur after birth if the mother's blood sugar was high close to the time of delivery, which causes the baby to produces extra insulin of its own. \n\nMild neurological and cognitive deficits in offspring — including increased symptoms of ADHD, impaired fine and gross motor skills, and impaired explicit memory performance — have been linked to pregestational type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes. Prenatal iron deficiency has been suggested as a possible mechanism for these problems.\n\nBirth defects are not currently an identified risk for the child of women with gestational diabetes, since those primarily occur in the latter part of pregnancy, where vital organs already have taken their most essential shape.\n\nHigh blood sugar levels are harmful to the mother and her fetus. Experts advise diabetics to maintain blood sugar level close to normal range for 2 to 3 months before planning for pregnancy. Managing blood sugar close to normal before and during pregnancy helps to protect the health of mother and the baby.\n\nInsulin may be needed for type 2 diabetics instead of oral diabetes medication. Extra insulin may be needed for type 1 diabetics during pregnancy. Doctors may advise to check blood sugar more often to maintain near-normal blood sugar levels.\n\nBlood glucose levels in pregnant woman should be regulated as strictly as possible. Higher levels of glucose early in pregnancy are associated with teratogenic effects on the developing fetus. A Cochrane review published in 2016 was designed to find out the most effective blood sugar range to guide treatment for women who develop gestational diabetes mellitus in their pregnancy. The review concluded that quality scientific evidence is not yet available to determine the best blood sugar range for improving health for pregnant women with diabetes and their babies.\n\nDuring the first weeks of pregnancy less insulin is required due to tight blood sugar control as well as the extra glucose needed for the growing fetus.At this time basal and bolus insulin may need to be reduced to prevent hypoglycemia. Frequent testing of blood sugar levels is recommended to maintain control. As the fetus grows and weight is gained through out the pregnancy, the body produces more hormones which may cause insulin resistance and the need for more insulin. At this time it is important for blood sugar levels to remain in range as the baby will produce more of its own insulin to cover its mother's higher blood sugar level which can cause fetal macrosomia. During delivery, which is equivalent to exercise, insulin needs to be reduced again or hyperglycemia can occur. After the baby is delivered and the days following, there are no more hormones from the placenta which demanded more insulin, therefore insulin demand is decreased and gradually returns to normal requirements.\n\nDiabetes mellitus may be effectively managed by appropriate meal planning, increased physical activity and properly-instituted insulin treatment. Some tips for controlling diabetes in pregnancy include:\n\n\nBreast feeding is good for the child even with a mother with diabetes mellitus. Some women wonder whether breast feeding is recommended after they have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Breast feeding is recommended for most babies, including when mothers may be diabetic. In fact, the child’s risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life may be lower if the baby was breast-fed. It also helps the child to maintain a healthy body weight during infancy. However, the breastmilk of mothers with diabetes has been demonstrated to have a different composition than that of non-diabetic mothers, containing elevated levels of glucose and insulin and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although benefits of breast-feeding for the children of diabetic mothers have been documented, ingestion of diabetic breast milk has also been linked to delayed language development on a dose-dependent basis.\n\nIn some cases, pregnant women with diabetes may be encouraged to express and store their colostrum during pregnancy, in case their blood sugar is too low for feeding the baby breast milk after birth. There is no evidence on the safety or potential benefits when pregnant women with diabetes express and store breast milk prior to the baby's birth.\n\nThe White classification, named after Priscilla White who pioneered research on the effect of diabetes types on perinatal outcome, is widely used to assess maternal and fetal risk. It distinguishes between gestational diabetes (type A) and diabetes that existed before pregnancy (pregestational diabetes). These two groups are further subdivided according to their associated risks and management.\n\nThere are 2 classes of gestational diabetes (diabetes which began during pregnancy): \n\nThe second group of diabetes which existed before pregnancy can be split up into these classes:\nAn early age of onset or long-standing disease comes with greater risks, hence the first three subtypes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34972497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34972497", "title": "Directed panspermia", "text": "Directed panspermia\n\nDirected panspermia is the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space to be used as introduced species on lifeless but habitable astronomical objects.\n\nHistorically, Shklovskii and Sagan (1966) and Crick and Orgel (1973) hypothesized that life on the Earth may have been seeded deliberately by other civilizations. Conversely, Mautner and Matloff (1979) and Mautner (1995, 1997) proposed that humanity should seed other planetary systems, protoplanetary discs or star-forming clouds with microorganisms, to secure and expand our organic gene/protein lifeform. To avoid interference with local life, the targets may be young planetary systems where local life is unlikely. Directed panspermia can be motivated by biotic ethics that value the basic patterns of organic gene/protein life with its unique complexity and unity, and its drive for self-propagation.\n\nDirected panspermia is becoming possible due to developments in solar sails, precise astrometry, the discovery of extrasolar planets, extremophiles and microbial genetic engineering. Cosmological projections suggest that life in space can then have a future.\n\nAn early example of the idea of directed panspermia dates to the early science fiction work \"Last and First Men\" by Olaf Stapledon, first published in 1930. It details the manner in which the last humans, upon discovering that the Solar System will soon be destroyed, send microscopic \"seeds of a new humanity\" towards potentially habitable areas of the universe.\n\nIn 1966 Shklovskii and Sagan speculated that life on Earth may have been seeded through directed panspermia by other civilisations. and in 1973 Crick and Orgel also discussed the concept. Conversely, Mautner and Matloff proposed in 1979, and Mautner examined in detail in 1995 and 1997 the technology and motivation to secure and expand our organic gene/protein life-form by directed panspermia missions to other planetary systems, protoplanetary discs and star-forming clouds. Technological aspects include propulsion by solar sails, deceleration by radiation pressure or viscous drag at the target, and capture of the colonizing micro-organisms by planets. A possible objection is potential interference with local life at the targets, but targeting young planetary systems where local life, especially advanced life, could not have started yet, avoids this problem.\nDirected panspermia may be motivated by the desire to perpetuate the common genetic heritage of all terrestrial life. This motivation was formulated as biotic ethics that value the common gene/protein patterns of self propagation, and as panbiotic ethics that aim to secure and expand life in the universe.\n\nDirected panspermia may be aimed at nearby young planetary systems such as Alpha PsA (25 ly (light-years) away) and Beta Pictoris (63.4 ly), both of which show accretion discs and signs of comets and planets. More suitable targets may be identified by space telescopes such as the Kepler mission that will identify nearby star systems with habitable astronomical objects. Alternatively, directed panspermia may aim at star-forming interstellar clouds such as Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex (427 ly), that contains clusters of new stars too young to originate local life (425 infrared-emitting young stars aged 100,000 to a million years). Such clouds contain zones with various densities (diffuse cloud < dark fragment < dense core < protostellar condensation < accretion disc) that could selectively capture panspermia capsules of various sizes.\n\nHabitable astronomical objects or habitable zones about nearby stars may be targeted by large (10 kg) missions where microbial capsules are bundled and shielded. Upon arrival, microbial capsules in the payload may be dispersed in orbit for capture by planets. Alternatively, small microbial capsules may be sent in large swarms to habitable planets, protoplanetary discs, or zones of various density in interstellar clouds. The microbial swarm provides minimal shielding but does not require high precision targeting, especially when aiming at large interstellar clouds.\n\nPanspermia missions should deliver microorganisms that can grow in the new habitats. They may be sent in 10 kg, 60 μm diameter capsules that allow intact atmospheric entry at the target planets, each containing 100,000 diverse microorganisms suited to various environments. Both for bundled large mass missions and microbial capsule swarms, solar sails may provide the most simple propulsion for interstellar transit. Spherical sails will avoid orientation control both at launch and at deceleration at the targets. \n\nFor bundled shielded missions to nearby star systems, solar sails with thicknesses of 10 m and areal densities of 0.0001 kg/m seem feasible, and sail/payload mass ratios of 10:1 will allow exit velocities near the maximum possible for such sails. Sails with about 540 m radius and area of 10 m can impart 10 kg payloads with interstellar cruise velocities of 0.0005 \"c\" (1.5x10 m/s) when launched from 1 au (astronomical unit). At this speed, voyage to the Alpha PsA star will last 50,000 y, and to the Rho Opiuchus cloud, 824,000 years.\n\nAt the targets, the microbial payload would decompose into 10 (100 billion) 30 µm capsules to increase the probability of capture. In the swarm strategy to protoplanetary discs and interstellar clouds, 1 mm radius, 4.2x10 kg microbial capsules are launched from 1 au using sails of 4.2x10 kg with radius of 0.37 m and area of 0.42 m to achieve cruising speeds of 0.0005 \"c\". At the target, each capsule decomposes into 4,000 delivery microcapsules of 10 kg and of 30 micrometer radius that allow intact entry to planetary atmospheres. \n\nFor missions that do not encounter dense gas zones, such as interstellar transit to mature planets or to habitable zones about stars, the microcapsules can be launched directly from 1 au using 10 kg sails of 1.8 mm radius to achieve velocities of 0.0005 \"c\" to be decelerated by radiation pressure for capture at the targets. \nThe 1 mm and 30 micrometer radius vehicles and payloads are needed in large numbers for both the bundled and swarm missions. These capsules and the miniature sails for swarm missions can be mass manufactured readily.\n\nThe panspermia vehicles would be aimed at moving targets whose locations at the time of arrival must be predicted. This can be calculated using their measured proper motions, their distances, and the cruising speeds of the vehicles. The positional uncertainty and size of the target object then allow estimating the probability that the panspermia vehicles will arrive at their targets.\nThe positional uncertainty δy (m) of the target at arrival time is given by equation (1), where α is the resolution of proper motion of the target object (arcsec/year), d is the distance from the Earth(m) and v is the velocity of the vehicle (m/s)\nGiven the positional uncertainty, the vehicles may be launched with a scatter in a circle about the predicted position of the target. The probability P for a capsule to hit the target area with radius r (m) is the given by the ratio of the targeting scatter and the target area. \nTo apply these equations, the precision of astrometry of star proper motion of 0.00001 arcsec/year, and the solar sail vehicle velocity of 0.0005 \"c\" (1.5 × 10 m/s) may be expected within a few decades. For a chosen planetary system, the area A may be the width of the habitable zone, while for interstellar clouds, it may be the sizes of the various density zones of the cloud.\n\nSolar sail missions to Sun-like stars can decelerate by radiation pressure in reverse dynamics of the launch. The sails must be properly oriented at arrival, but orientation control may be avoided using spherical sails. The vehicles must approach the target Sun-like stars at radial distances similar to the launch, about 1 au. After the vehicles are captured in orbit, the microbial capsules may be dispersed in a ring orbiting the star, some within the gravitational capture zone of planets.\nMissions to accretion discs of planets and to star-forming clouds will decelerate by viscous drag at the rate dv/dt as determined by equation (3), where v is the velocity, rc the radius of the spherical capsule, ρc is density of the capsule and ρm is the density of the medium. \nA vehicle entering the cloud with a velocity of 0.0005 \"c\" (1.5 × 10 m/s) will be captured when decelerated to 2,000 m/s, the typical speed of grains in the cloud. \nThe size of the capsules can be designed to stop at zones with various densities in the interstellar cloud. Simulations show that a 35 micron radius capsule will be captured in a dense core, and a 1 mm radius capsule in a protostellar condensation in the cloud. As for approach to accretion discs about stars, a millimetre size capsule entering the 1000 km thick disc face at 0.0005 \"c\" will be captured at 100 km into the disc. Therefore, 1 mm sized objects may be the best for seeding protoplanetary discs about new stars and protostellar condensations in interstellar clouds.\n\nThe captured panspermia capsules will mix with dust. A fraction of the dust and a proportional fraction of the captured capsules will be delivered to astronomical objects. Dispersing the payload into delivery microcapsules will increase the chance that some will be delivered to habitable objects. Particles of 0.6 - 60 micron radius can remain cold enough to preserve organic matter during atmospheric entry to planets or moons. Accordingly, each 1 mm, 4.2 ×10 kg capsule captured in the viscous medium can be dispersed into 42,000 delivery microcapsules of 30 micron radius, each weighing 10 kg and containing 100,000 microbes. These objects will not be ejected from the dust cloud by radiation pressure from the star, and will remain mixed with the dust. \nA fraction of the dust, containing the captured microbial capsules, will be captured by planets or moons, or captured in comets and delivered by them later to planets. The probability of capture, P, can be estimated from similar processes, such as the capture of interplanetary dust particles by planets and moons in our Solar System, where 10 of the Zodiacal cloud maintained by comet ablation, and also a similar fraction of asteroid fragments, is collected by the Earth. \nThe probability of capture of an initially launched capsule by a planet (or astronomical object) P is given by the equation below, where P is the probability that the capsule reaches the target accretion disc or cloud zone, and P is the probability of capture from this zone by a planet. \nThe probability P depends on the mixing ratio of the capsules with the dust and on the fraction of the dust delivered to planets. These variables can be estimated for capture in planetary accretion discs or in various zones in the interstellar cloud.\n\nAfter determining the composition of chosen meteorites, astroecologists performed laboratory experiments that suggest that many colonizing microorganisms and some plants could obtain most of their chemical nutrients from asteroid and cometary materials. However, the scientists noted that phosphate (PO) and nitrate (NO–N) critically limit nutrition to many terrestrial lifeforms. For successful missions, enough biomass must be launched and captured for a reasonable chance to initiate life at the target astronomical object. An optimistic requirement is the capture by the planet of 100 capsules with 100,000 microorganisms each, for a total of 10 million organisms with a total biomass of 10 kg.\n\nThe required biomass to launch for a successful mission is given by following equation. \nm (kg) = 10 / P \nUsing the above equations for P with transit velocities of 0.0005 c, the known distances to the targets, and the masses of the dust in the target regions then allows calculating the biomass that needs to be launched for probable success. With these parameters, as little as 1 gram of biomass (10 microorganisms) could seed Alpha PsA and 4.5 gram could seed Beta Pictoris. More biomass needs to be launched to the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, mainly because its larger distance. A biomass on the order of 300 tons would need to be launched to seed a protostellar condensation or an accretion disc, but two hundred kilograms would be sufficient to seed a young stellar object in the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex.\n\nConsequently, as long as the required physical range of tolerance are met (e.g.: growth temperature, cosmic radiation shielding, atmosphere and gravity), lifeforms viable on Earth may be chemically nourished by watery asteroid and planetary materials in this and other planetary systems.\n\nThe seeding organisms need to survive and multiply in the target environments and establish a viable biosphere. Some of the new branches of life may develop intelligent beings who will further expand life in the galaxy.\nThe messenger microorganisms may find diverse environments, requiring extremophile microorganisms with a range of tolerances, including thermophile (high temperature), psychrophile (low temperature), acidophile (high acidity), halophile (high salinity), oligotroph (low nutrient concentration), xerophile (dry environments) and radioresistant (high radiation tolerance) microorganisms. Genetic engineering may produce polyextremophile microorganisms with several tolerances. \nThe target atmospheres will probably lack oxygen, so the colonizers should include anaerobic microorganisms. Colonizing anaerobic cyanobacteria may later establish atmospheric oxygen that is needed for higher evolution, as it happened on Earth. Aerobic organisms in the biological payload may be delivered to the astronomical objects later when the conditions are right, by comets that captured and preserved the capsules.\n\nThe development of eukaryote microorganisms was a major bottleneck to higher evolution on Earth. Including eukaryote microorganisms in the payload can bypass this barrier. Multicellular organisms are even more desirable, but being much heavier than bacteria, fewer can be sent. Hardy tardigrades (water-bears) may be suitable but they are similar to arthropods and would lead to insects. The body-plan of rotifers could lead to higher animals, if the rotifers can be hardened to survive interstellar transit.\n\nMicroorganisms or capsules captured in the accretion disc can be captured along with the dust into asteroids. During aqueous alteration the asteroids contain water, inorganic salts and organics, and astroecology experiments with meteorites showed that algae, bacteria, fungi and plant cultures can grow in the asteroids in these media. \nMicroorganisms can then spread in the accreting solar nebula, and will be delivered to planets in comets and in asteroids. The microorganisms can grow on nutrients in the carrier comets and asteroids in the aqueous planetary environments, until they adapt to the local environments and nutrients on the planets.\n\nA number of publications since 1979 have proposed the idea that directed panspermia could be demonstrated to be the origin of all life on Earth if a distinctive 'signature' message were found, deliberately implanted into either the genome or the genetic code of the first microorganisms by our hypothetical progenitor. In 2013 a team of physicists claimed that they had found mathematical and semiotic patterns in the genetic code which, they believe, is evidence for such a signature. This claim has not been substantiated by further study, or accepted by the wider scientific community. One outspoken critic is biologist PZ Myers who said, writing in Pharyngula: In a later peer-reviewed article, the authors address the operation of natural law in an extensive statistical test, and draw the same conclusion as in the previous article. In special sections they also discuss methodological concerns raised by PZ Myers and some others.\n\nSignificantly, panspermia missions can be launched by present or near-future technologies. However, more advanced technologies may be also used when these become available. \nThe biological aspects of directed panspermia may be improved by genetic engineering to produce hardy polyextremophile microorganisms and multicellular organisms, suitable to diverse astronomical objects environments. Hardy polyextremophile anaerobic multicellular eukaryots with high radiation resistance, that can form a self-sustaining ecosystem with cyanobacteria, would combine ideally the features needed for survival and higher evolution.\n\nFor advanced missions, ion thrusters or solar sails using beam-powered propulsion accelerated by Earth-based lasers can achieve speeds up to 0.01 \"c\" (3 x 10 m/s). Robots may provide in-course navigation, may control the reviving of the frozen microbes periodically during transit to repair radiation damage, and may also choose suitable targets. These propulsion methods and robotics are under development.\n\nMicrobial payloads may be also planted on hyperbolic comets bound for interstellar space. This strategy follows the mechanisms of natural panspermia by comets, as suggested by Hoyle and Wikramasinghe. The microorganisms would be frozen in the comets at interstellar temperatures of a few kelvins and protected from radiation for eons. It is unlikely that an ejected comet will be captured in another planetary system, but the probability can be increased by allowing the microbes to multiply during warm perihelion approach to the Sun, then fragmenting the comet. A 1 km radius comet would yield 4.2 x 10 one-kg seeded fragments, and rotating the comet would eject these shielded icy objects in random directions into the galaxy. This increases a trillion-fold the probability of capture in another planetary system, compared with transport by a single comet. Such manipulation of comets is a speculative long-term prospect.\n\nThe German physicist Claudius Gros has proposed that the technology developed by the Breakthrough Starshot initiative may be utilized in a second step to establish a biosphere of unicellular microbes on otherwise only transiently habitable astronomical objects. The aim of this initiative, the Genesis project, would be to fast forward evolution to a stage equivalent of the precambrian period on Earth. Gros argues that the Genesis project would be realizable within 50-100 years, using low-weight probes equipped with a miniaturized gene laboratory for the \"in situ\" cell synthesis of the microbes. The Genesis project extends directed panspermia to eukaryotic life, arguing that it is more likely that complex life is rare, and not bacterial life.\n\nDirected panspermia aims to secure and expand our family of organic gene/protein life. It may be motivated by the desire to perpetuate the common genetic heritage of all terrestrial life. This motivation was formulated as biotic ethics, that value the common gene/protein patterns of organic life, and as panbiotic ethics that aim to secure and expand life in the universe.\n\nMolecular biology shows complex patterns common to all cellular life, a common genetic code and a common mechanism to translate it into proteins, which in turn help to reproduce the DNA code. Also, shared are the basic mechanisms of energy use and material transport. These self-propagating patterns and processes are the core of organic gene/protein life. \nLife is unique because of this complexity, and because of the exact coincidence of the laws of physics that allow life to exist. Also unique to life is the pursuit of self-propagation, which implies a human purpose to secure and expand life. These objectives are best secured in space, suggesting a panbiotic ethics aimed to secure this future.\n\nThe main objection to directed panspermia is that it may interfere with local life at the targets. The colonizing microorganisms may out-compete local life for resources, or infect and harm local organisms. However, this probability can be minimized by targeting newly forming planetary systems, accretion discs and star-forming clouds, where local life, and especially advanced life, could not have emerged yet. If there is local life that is fundamentally different, the colonizing microorganisms may not harm it. If there is local organic gene/protein life, it may exchange genes with the colonizing microorganisms, increasing galactic biodiversity.\nAnother objection is that space should be left pristine for scientific studies, a reason for planetary quarantine. However, directed panspermia may reach only a few, at most a few hundred new stars, still leaving a hundred billion pristine for local life and for research. \nA technical objection is the uncertain survival of the messenger organisms during long interstellar transit. Research by simulations, and the development on hardy colonizers is needed to address this questions.\n\nA third argument against engaging in directed panspermia derives from the view that wild animals do not —on the average— have lives worth living, and thus spreading life would be morally wrong. Ng supports this view, focusing mainly on the fact that almost all animal species have many more offspring than are needed to replace them. The large number of offspring implies that most of them will die before reaching reproductive age, providing only a short window of life before an often unpleasant death. Tomasik agrees, but places significant weight on the extreme suffering many animals experience, especially at death. Plant responds in detail to Tomasik, arguing that because of the vast number of diverse species and the difficulty of rating animal pain and pleasure, we cannot determine if animals have lives worth living. If wild animal lives are overall negative in quality (with more suffering than pleasure), then spreading life through panspermia would be spreading needless pain. From this perspective, directed panspermia is to be strictly avoided, unless and until we can determine that the lives of the animals generated by it would average positive.\n\nThe discovery of an ancient directed panspermia effort is the central theme of \",\" an episode of \"\". In the story, Captain Picard must work to complete the penultimate research of his late archaeology professor's career. That professor, Galen, had discovered that DNA fragments seeded into the primordial genetic material of 19 worlds could be rearranged to assemble a computer algorithm. Amid competition (and, later, with begrudging cooperation) from Cardassian, Klingon and Romulan expeditions also exploring Galen's research clues, the \"Enterprise\" crew discovers that an alien progenitor race had indeed, 4 billion years prior, seeded genetic material across many star systems, thus directing the evolution of many humanoid species.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46135", "title": "George Lakoff", "text": "George Lakoff\n\nGeorge P. Lakoff (; born May 24, 1941) is an American cognitive linguist and philosopher, best known for his thesis that lives of individuals are significantly influenced by the central metaphors they use to explain complex phenomena.\n\nThe conceptual metaphor thesis, introduced in his and Mark Johnson's 1980 book \"Metaphors We Live By\" has found applications in a number of academic disciplines. Applying it to politics, literature, philosophy and mathematics has led Lakoff into territory normally considered basic to political science. In his 1996 book \"Moral Politics\", Lakoff described conservative voters as being influenced by the \"strict father model\" as a central metaphor for such a complex phenomenon as the state, and liberal/progressive voters as being influenced by the \"nurturant parent model\" as the folk psychological metaphor for this complex phenomenon. According to him, an individual's experience and attitude towards sociopolitical issues is influenced by being framed in linguistic constructions. In \"Metaphor and War: The Metaphor System Used to Justify War in the Gulf\" (1991), he argues that the American involvement in the Gulf war was obscured or \"spun\" by the metaphors which were used by the first Bush administration to justify it.\nBetween 2003 and 2008, Lakoff was involved with a progressive think tank, the now defunct Rockridge Institute. He is a member of the scientific committee of the Fundación IDEAS (IDEAS Foundation), Spain's Socialist Party's think tank.\n\nThe more general theory that elaborated his thesis is known as embodied mind. Lakoff served as a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1972 until his retirement in 2016.\n\nAlthough some of Lakoff's research involves questions traditionally pursued by linguists, such as the conditions under which a certain linguistic construction is grammatically viable, he is best known for his reappraisal of the role that metaphors play in the socio-political life of humans.\n\nMetaphor has been seen within the Western scientific tradition as a purely linguistic construction. The essential thrust of Lakoff's work has been the argument that metaphors are a primarily conceptual construction and are in fact central to the development of thought.\n\nIn his words: \n\nAccording to Lakoff, non-metaphorical thought is possible only when we talk about purely physical reality; the greater the level of abstraction, the more layers of metaphor are required to express it. People do not notice these metaphors for various reasons, including that some metaphors become 'dead' in the sense that we no longer recognize their origin. Another reason is that we just don't \"see\" what is \"going on\".\n\nIn intellectual debate, for instance, the underlying metaphor according to Lakoff is usually that argument is war (later revised to \"argument is struggle\"):\n\nAccording to Lakoff, the development of thought has been the process of developing better metaphors. He also points out that the application of one domain of knowledge to another offers new perceptions and understandings.\n\nLakoff began his career as a student and later a teacher of the theory of transformational grammar developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Noam Chomsky. In the late 1960s, however, he joined with others to promote generative semantics as an alternative to Chomsky's generative syntax. In an interview he stated:\n\nLakoff's claim that Chomsky asserts independence between syntax and semantics has been rejected by Chomsky, who has given examples from within his work where he talks about the relationship between semantics and syntax. Chomsky goes further and claims that Lakoff has \"virtually no comprehension of the work he is discussing\" (the work in question being Chomsky's). His differences with Chomsky contributed to fierce, acrimonious debates among linguists that have come to be known as the \"linguistics wars\".\n\nWhen Lakoff claims the mind is \"embodied\", he is arguing that almost all of human cognition, up through the most abstract reasoning, depends on and makes use of such concrete and \"low-level\" facilities as the sensorimotor system and the emotions. Therefore, embodiment is a rejection not only of dualism vis-a-vis mind and matter, but also of claims that human reason can be basically understood without reference to the underlying \"implementation details\".\n\nLakoff offers three complementary but distinct sorts of arguments in favor of embodiment. First, using evidence from neuroscience and neural network simulations, he argues that certain concepts, such as color and spatial relation concepts (e.g. \"red\" or \"over\"; see also \"qualia\"), can be almost entirely understood through the examination of how processes of perception or motor control work.\n\nSecond, based on cognitive linguistics' analysis of figurative language, he argues that the reasoning we use for such abstract topics as warfare, economics, or morality is somehow rooted in the reasoning we use for such mundane topics as spatial relationships. (See conceptual metaphor.)\n\nFinally, based on research in cognitive psychology and some investigations in the philosophy of language, he argues that very few of the categories used by humans are actually of the black-and-white type amenable to analysis in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. On the contrary, most categories are supposed to be much more complicated and messy, just like our bodies.\n\n\"We are neural beings\", Lakoff states, \"Our brains take their input from the rest of our bodies. What our bodies are like and how they function in the world thus structures the very concepts we can use to think. We cannot think just anything — only what our embodied brains permit.\"\n\nLakoff believes consciousness to be neurally embodied, however he explicitly states that the mechanism is not just neural computation alone. Using the concept of disembodiment, Lakoff supports the physicalist approach to the afterlife. If the soul can not have any of the properties of the body, then Lakoff claims it can not feel, perceive, think, be conscious, or have a personality. If this is true, then Lakoff asks what would be the point of the afterlife? \n\nMany scientists share the belief that there are problems with falsifiability and foundation ontologies purporting to describe \"what exists\", to a sufficient degree of rigor to establish a reasonable method of empirical validation. But Lakoff takes this further to explain why hypotheses built with complex metaphors cannot be directly falsified. Instead, they can only be rejected based on interpretations of empirical observations guided by other complex metaphors. This is what he means when he says that falsifiability itself can never be established by any reasonable method that would not rely ultimately on a shared human bias. The bias he's referring to is the set of conceptual metaphors governing how people interpret observations.\n\nLakoff is, with coauthors Mark Johnson and Rafael E. Núñez, one of the primary proponents of the embodied mind thesis. Lakoff discussed these themes in his 2001 Gifford Lectures at the University of Glasgow, published as \"The Nature and Limits of Human Understanding\". Others who have written about the embodied mind include philosopher Andy Clark (See his \"Being There\"), philosopher and neurobiologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela and his student Evan Thompson (See Varela, Thompson & Rosch's \"The Embodied Mind\"), roboticists such as Rodney Brooks, Rolf Pfeifer and Tom Ziemke, the physicist David Bohm (see his \"Thought As A System\"), Ray Gibbs (see his \"Embodiment and Cognitive Science\"), John Grinder and Richard Bandler in their neuro-linguistic programming, and Julian Jaynes. The work of these writers can be traced back to earlier philosophical writings, most notably in the phenomenological tradition, such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger. The basic thesis of \"embodied mind\" is also traceable to the American contextualist or pragmatist tradition, notably John Dewey in such works as \"Art As Experience\".\n\nAccording to Lakoff, even mathematics is subjective to the human species and its cultures: thus \"any question of math's being inherent in physical reality is moot, since there is no way to know whether or not it is.\" By this, he is saying that there is nothing outside of the thought structures we derive from our embodied minds that we can use to \"prove\" that mathematics is somehow beyond biology. Lakoff and Rafael E. Núñez (2000) argue at length that mathematical and philosophical ideas are best understood in light of the embodied mind. The philosophy of mathematics ought therefore to look to the current scientific understanding of the human body as a foundation ontology, and abandon self-referential attempts to ground the operational components of mathematics in anything other than \"meat\".\n\nMathematical reviewers have generally been critical of Lakoff and Núñez, pointing to mathematical errors . Lakoff claims that these errors have been corrected in subsequent printings . Although their book attempts a refutation of some of the most widely accepted viewpoints in philosophy of mathematics and advice for how the field might proceed, they have yet to elicit much of a reaction from philosophers of mathematics themselves. The small community specializing in the psychology of mathematical learning, to which Núñez belongs, is paying attention.\n\nLakoff has also claimed that we should remain agnostic about whether math is somehow wrapped up with the very nature of the universe. Early in 2001 Lakoff told the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS): \"Mathematics may or may not be out there in the world, but there's no way that we scientifically could possibly tell.\" This is because the structures of scientific knowledge are not \"out there\" but rather in our brains, based on the details of our anatomy. Therefore, we cannot \"tell\" that mathematics is \"out there\" without relying on conceptual metaphors rooted in our biology. This claim bothers those who believe that there really is a way we could \"tell\". The falsifiability of this claim is perhaps the central problem in the cognitive science of mathematics, a field that attempts to establish a foundation ontology based on the human cognitive and scientific process.\n\nLakoff has publicly expressed both ideas about the conceptual structures that he views as central to understanding the political process, and some of his particular political views. He almost always discusses the latter in terms of the former.\n\n\"Moral Politics\" (1996, revisited in 2002) gives book-length consideration to the conceptual metaphors that Lakoff sees as present in the minds of American \"liberals\" and \"conservatives\". The book is a blend of cognitive science and political analysis. Lakoff makes an attempt to keep his personal views confined to the last third of the book, where he explicitly argues for the superiority of the liberal vision.\n\nLakoff argues that the differences in opinions between liberals and conservatives follow from the fact that they subscribe with different strength to two different central metaphors about the relationship of the state to its citizens. Both, he claims, see governance through metaphors of the family. Conservatives would subscribe more strongly and more often to a model that he calls the \"strict father model\" and has a family structured around a strong, dominant \"father\" (government), and assumes that the \"children\" (citizens) need to be disciplined to be made into responsible \"adults\" (morality, self-financing). Once the \"children\" are \"adults\", though, the \"father\" should not interfere with their lives: the government should stay out of the business of those in society who have proved their responsibility. In contrast, Lakoff argues that liberals place more support in a model of the family, which he calls the \"nurturant parent model\", based on \"nurturant values\", where both \"mothers\" and \"fathers\" work to keep the essentially good \"children\" away from \"corrupting influences\" (pollution, social injustice, poverty, etc.). Lakoff says that most people have a blend of both metaphors applied at different times, and that political speech works primarily by invoking these metaphors and urging the subscription of one over the other.\n\nLakoff further argues that one of the reasons liberals have had difficulty since the 1980s is that they have not been as aware of their own guiding metaphors, and have too often accepted conservative terminology framed in a way to promote the strict father metaphor. Lakoff insists that liberals must cease using terms like \"partial birth abortion\" and \"tax relief\" because they are manufactured specifically to allow the possibilities of only certain types of opinions. \"Tax relief\" for example, implies explicitly that taxes are an affliction, something someone would want \"relief\" from. To use the terms of another metaphoric worldview, Lakoff insists, is to unconsciously support it. Liberals must support linguistic think tanks in the same way that conservatives do if they are going to succeed in appealing to those in the country who share their metaphors.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2008, Lakoff was involved with a progressive think tank, the Rockridge Institute, an involvement that follows in part from his recommendations in \"Moral Politics\". Among his activities with the Institute, which concentrates in part on helping liberal candidates and politicians with re-framing political metaphors, Lakoff has given numerous public lectures and written accounts of his message from \"Moral Politics.\" In 2008, Lakoff joined Fenton Communications, the nation's largest public interest communications firm, as a Senior Consultant.\n\nOne of his political works, \"Don't Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate\", self-labeled as \"the Essential Guide for Progressives\", was published in September 2004 and features a foreword by former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean.\n\nIn 2006 Steven Pinker wrote an unfavorable review of Lakoff's book \"Whose Freedom?\" in \"The New Republic\". Pinker argued that Lakoff's propositions are unsupported, and his prescriptions are a recipe for electoral failure. He wrote that Lakoff was condescending and deplored Lakoff's \"shameless caricaturing of beliefs\" and his \"faith in the power of euphemism\". Pinker portrayed Lakoff's arguments as \"cognitive relativism, in which mathematics, science, and philosophy are beauty contests between rival frames rather than attempts to characterize the nature of reality.\" Lakoff wrote a rebuttal to the review stating that his position on many matters is the exact reverse of what Pinker attributes to him. Lakoff states that he explicitly rejects cognitive relativism, arguing that he is \"a realist, both about how the mind works and how the world works. Given that the mind works by frames and metaphors, the challenge is to use such a mind to accurately characterize how the world works.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1904 it began producing a dried-milk baby food from excess milk produced on the family farms outside Bunnythorpe. The resulting product was first known as Defiance, then as Glaxo (from \"lacto\"), under the slogan \"Glaxo builds bonny babies.\" The Glaxo Laboratories sign is still visible \"(right)\" on what is now a car repair shop on the main street of Bunnythorpe. The company's first pharmaceutical product, released in 1924, was vitamin D.\n\nGlaxo Laboratories was registered as a subsidiary company in London in 1935. Glaxo bought out its parent, Joseph Nathan in 1947 and acquired Allen & Hanburys in 1958. The Scottish pharmacologist David Jack was hired as a researcher for Allen & Hanburys a few years after Glaxo took it over; he went on to lead the company's R&D until 1987. After the company bought Meyer Laboratories in 1978, it began to play an important role in the US market. In 1983 the American arm, Glaxo Inc., moved to Research Triangle Park (US headquarters/research) and Zebulon (US manufacturing) in North Carolina.\n\nBurroughs Wellcome & Company was founded in 1880 in London by the American pharmacists Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs. The Wellcome Tropical Research Laboratories opened in 1902. In the 1920s Burroughs Wellcome established research and manufacturing facilities in Tuckahoe, New York, which served as the US headquarters until the company moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina in 1971. The Nobel Prize winning scientists Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings worked there and invented drugs still used many years later, such as mercaptopurine. In 1959 the Wellcome Foundation bought Cooper, McDougall & Robertson Inc to become more active in animal health. Glaxo and Wellcome merged in 1995 to form Glaxo Wellcome plc. Glaxo Wellcome restructured its R&D operation that year, cutting 10,000 jobs worldwide, closing its R&D facility in Beckenham, Kent, and opening a Medicines Research Centre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Also that year, Glaxo Wellcome acquired the California-based Affymax, a leader in the field of combinatorial chemistry.\n\nBy 1999 Glaxo Wellcome had become the world's third-largest pharmaceutical company by revenues (behind Novartis and Merck), with a global market share of around 4 per cent. Its products included Imigran (for the treatment of migraine), salbutamol (Ventolin) (for the treatment of asthma), Zovirax (for the treatment of coldsores), and Retrovir and Epivir (for the treatment of AIDS). In 1999 the company was the world's largest manufacturer of drugs for the treatment of asthma and HIV/AIDS. It employed 59,000 people, including 13,400 in the UK, had 76 operating companies and 50 manufacturing facilities worldwide, and seven of its products were among the world's top 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals. The company had R&D facilities in Hertfordshire, Kent, London and Verona (Italy), and manufacturing plants in Scotland and the north of England. It had R&D centres in the US and Japan, and production facilities in the US, Europe and the Far East.\n\nIn 1848 Thomas Beecham launched his Beecham's Pills laxative in England, giving birth to the Beecham Group. In 1859 Beecham opened its first factory in St Helens, Lancashire. By the 1960s Beecham was extensively involved in pharmaceuticals and consumer products such as Macleans toothpaste, Lucozade and synthetic penicillin research.\n\nJohn K. Smith opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia in 1830. In 1865 Mahlon Kline joined the business, which 10 years later became Smith, Kline & Co. In 1891 it merged with French, Richard and Company, and in 1929 changed its name to Smith Kline & French Laboratories as it focused more on research. Years later it bought Norden Laboratories, a business doing research into animal health, and Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques in Belgium in 1963 to focus on vaccines. The company began to expand globally, buying seven laboratories in Canada and the United States in 1969. In 1982 it bought Allergan, a manufacturer of eye and skincare products.\n\nSmithKline & French merged with Beckman Inc. in 1982 and changed its name to \"SmithKline Beckman\". In 1988 it bought its biggest competitor, International Clinical Laboratories, and in 1989 merged with Beecham to form \"SmithKline Beecham plc\". The headquarters moved from the United States to England. To expand R&D in the United States, the company bought a new research center in 1995; another opened in 1997 in England at New Frontiers Science Park, Harlow.\n\nGlaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham announced their intention to merge in January 2000. The merger was completed in December that year, forming GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The company's global headquarters are at GSK House, Brentford, London, officially opened in 2002 by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. The building was erected at a cost of £300 million and as of 2002 was home to 3,000 administrative staff.\n\nGSK completed the acquisition of New Jersey-based Block Drug in 2001 for US$1.24 billion. In 2006 GSK acquired the US-based consumer healthcare company CNS Inc., whose products included Breathe Right nasal strips and FiberChoice dietary supplements, for US$566 million in cash.\n\nChris Gent, previously CEO of Vodafone, was appointed chairman of the board in 2005. GSK opened its first R&D centre in China in 2007, in Shanghai, initially focused on neurodegenerative diseases. Andrew Witty became the chief executive officer in 2008. Witty joined Glaxo in 1985 and had been president of GSK's Pharmaceuticals Europe since 2003.\n\nIn 2009 GSK acquired Stiefel Laboratories, then the world's largest independent dermatology drug company, for US$3.6bn. In November the FDA approved GSK's vaccine for 2009 H1N1 influenza protection, manufactured by the company's ID Biomedical Corp in Canada. Also in November 2009 GSK formed a joint venture with Pfizer to create ViiV Healthcare, which specializes in HIV research. In 2010 the company acquired Laboratorios Phoenix, an Argentine pharmaceutical company, for US$253m, and the UK-based sports nutrition company Maxinutrition for £162 million (US$256 million).\n\nIn 2011, in a $660-million deal, Prestige Brands Holdings took over 17 GSK brands with sales of $210 million, including BC Powder, Beano, Ecotrin, Fiber Choice, Goody's Powder, Sominex and Tagamet. In 2012 the company announced that it would invest £500 million in manufacturing facilities in Ulverston, northern England, designating it as the site for a previously announced biotech plant. In May that year it acquired CellZome, a German biotech company, for US$98 million, and in June worldwide rights to alitretinoin (Toctino), an eczema drug, for $302 million. In 2013 GSK acquired Human Genome Sciences (HGS) for $3 billion; the companies had collaborated on developing the lupus drug Belimumab (Benlysta), albiglutide for type 2 diabetes, and darapladib for atherosclerosis.\n\nIn March 2014, GSK paid $1 billion to raise its stake in its Indian pharmaceutical unit, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, to 75 percent as part of a move to focus on emerging markets. In April 2014 Novartis and Glaxo agreed on more than $20 billion in deals, with Novartis selling its vaccine business to GSK and buying GSK's cancer business. In February 2015 GSK announced that it would acquire GlycoVaxyn, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, for $190 million, and in June that year that it would sell two meningitis drugs to Pfizer, Nimenrix and Mencevax for around $130 million.\n\nPhilip Hampton, at that time chair of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became GSK chairman in September 2015.\n\nIn September 2016, the company announced that Witty would be succeeded as CEO by Emma Walmsley in March 2017; Walmsley was a management professional originally from Lancashire with a background in marketing.\n\nIn December 2017, Reuters reported that Glaxo had increased its stake in its Saudi Arabian unit to 75% (from 49%) taking over control from its Saudi partner Banaja KSA Holding Company.\n\nIn March 2018, GSK announced that it has reached an agreement with Novartis to acquire Novartis’ 36.5% stake in their Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture for $13 billion (£9.2 billion). This acquisition is consistent with the notion prevalent by July 2018 that the company was seriously considering a breakup that would spin-off the company's Consumer division. With respect to rare diseases, the company divested its portfolio of gene therapy drugs to Orchard Therapeutics in April 2018. In late November \"Reuters\" reported that Unilever was in prime position to acquire GSK's interest in its Indian unit, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Ltd, in a sale that could generate around $4 billion for the company. GSK currently holds a 72.5% shareholding. Nestlé and Coca-Cola have also been reported to be interested in the business unit as they look to strengthen their presence in India.\n\nSR One was established in 1985 by SmithKline Beecham to invest in new biotechnology companies and continued operating after GSK was formed; by 2003 GSK had formed another subsidiary, GSK Ventures, to out-license or start new companies around drug candidates that it did not intend to develop further. As of 2003, SR One tended to invest only if the company aligned with GSK's business.\n\nGSK manufactures products for major disease areas such as asthma, cancer, infections, diabetes and mental health. Its biggest-selling products in 2013 were Advair, Avodart, Flovent, Augmentin, Lovaza, and Lamictal; its drugs and vaccines earned £21.3 billion that year. Other top-selling products include its asthma/COPD inhalers Advair, Ventolin, and Flovent; its diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine Infanrix and its hepatitis B vaccine; the epilepsy drug Lamictal, and the antibacterial Augmentin.\n\nMedicines historically discovered or developed at GSK and its legacy companies and now sold as generics include amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin-clavulanate, mupirocin, and ceftazidime for bacterial infections, zidovudine for HIV infection, valacyclovir for herpes virus infections, albendazole for parasitic infections, sumatriptan for migraine, lamotrigine for epilepsy, bupropion and paroxetine for major depressive disorder, cimetidine and ranitidine for gastroesophageal reflux disorder, mercaptopurine and thioguanine for the treatment of leukemia, allopurinol for gout, pyrimethamine for malaria, and the antibacterial trimethoprim.\n\nAmong these, albendazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, allopurinol, mercaptopurine, mupriocin, pyrimethamine, ranitidine, thioguanine, trimethoprim and zidovudine are listed on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications.\n\nIn 2014 GSK applied for regulatory approval for the first malaria vaccine. Malaria is responsible for over 650,000 deaths annually, mainly in Africa. Known as RTS,S, the vaccine was developed as a joint project with the PATH vaccines initiative and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The company has committed to making the vaccine available in developing countries for five percent above the cost of production.\n\nAs of 2013 RTS,S, which uses GSK's proprietary AS01 adjuvant, was being examined in a Phase 3 trial in eight African countries. PATH reported that \"[i]n the 12-month period following vaccination, RTS,S conferred approximately 50% protection from clinical Plasmodium falciparum disease in children aged 5-17 months, and approximately 30% protection in children aged 6-12 weeks when administered in conjunction with Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) vaccines.\" In 2014 Glaxo said it had spent more than $350 million and expected to spend an additional $260 million before seeking regulatory approval. A second generation malaria vaccine is being evaluated in Phase 2 clinical trials.\n\nGSK's consumer healthcare division, which earned £5.2 billion in 2013, sells oral healthcare, including Aquafresh, Maclean's and Sensodyne toothpastes; and drinks such as Horlicks, Boost and a chocolate-flavoured malt drink sold in India. GSK also previously owned the Lucozade and Ribena brands of soft drinks, but they were sold in 2013 to Suntory for £1.35bn. Other products include Abreva to treat cold sores; Night Nurse, a cold remedy; Breathe Right nasal strips; and Nicoderm and Nicorette nicotine replacements. In March 2014 it recalled Alli, an over-the-counter weight-loss drug, in the United States and Puerto Rico because of possible tampering, following customer complaints.\n\nAs of 2013 GSK had offices in over 115 countries and employed over 99,000 people, 12,500 in R&D. The company's single largest market is the United States. Its US headquarters are in The Navy Yard, Philadelphia, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; its consumer-products division is in Moon Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nFour GlaxoSmithKline scientists have been recognized by the Nobel Committee for their contributions to basic medical science and/or therapeutics development.\n\nSince 2010, GlaxoSmithKline has several times ranked first among pharmaceutical companies on the Global Access to Medicines Index, which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2014 the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT-rights advocacy group gave GSK a score of 100 percent in its Corporate Equality Index.\n\nGSK has been active, with the World Health Organization (WHO), in the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF). Around 120 million people globally are believed to be infected with lymphatic filariasis. In 2012 the company endorsed the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases; it agreed to donate 400 million albendazole tablets to the WHO each year to fight soil-transmitted helminthiasis and to provide 600 million albendazole tablets every year for lymphatic filariasis until the disease is eradicated. As of 2014 over 5 billion treatments had been delivered, and 18 of 73 countries in which the disease is considered endemic had progressed to the surveillance stage.\n\nIn 2009 the company said it would cut drug prices by 25 percent in 50 of the poorest nations, release intellectual property rights for substances and processes relevant to neglected disease into a patent pool to encourage new drug development, and invest 20 percent of profits from the least-developed countries in medical infrastructure for those countries. Médecins Sans Frontières welcomed the decision, but criticized GSK for failing to include HIV patents in its patent pool and for not including middle-income countries in the initiative.\n\nIn 2013 GSK licensed its HIV portfolio to the Medicines Patent Pool for use in children, and agreed to negotiate a license for dolutegravir, an integrase inhibitor then in clinical development. In 2014 this license was extended to include dolutegravir and adults with HIV. The licenses include countries in which 93 percent of adults and 99 percent of children with HIV live. Also in 2013 GSK joined AllTrials, a British campaign to ensure that all clinical trials are registered and the results reported. The company said it would make its past clinical-trial reports available and future ones within a year of the studies' end.\n\nIn July 2012 GSK pleaded guilty in the United States to criminal charges, and agreed to pay $3 billion, in what was the largest settlement until then between the Justice Department and a drug company. The $3 billion included a criminal fine of $956,814,400 and forfeiture of $43,185,600. The remaining $2 billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the False Claims Act. The investigation was launched largely on the basis of information from four whistleblowers who filed qui tam (whistleblower) lawsuits against the company under the False Claims Act.\n\nThe charges stemmed from GSK's promotion of the anti-depressants Paxil (paroxetine) and Wellbutrin (bupropion) for unapproved uses from 1998–2003, specifically as suitable for patients under the age of 18, and from its failure to report safety data about Avandia (rosiglitazone), both in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Other drugs promoted for unapproved uses were two inhalers, Advair (fluticasone/salmeterol) and Flovent (fluticasone propionate), as well as Zofran (ondansetron), Imitrex (sumatriptan), Lotronex (alosetron) and Valtrex (valaciclovir).\n\nThe settlement also covered reporting false best prices and underpaying rebates owed under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and kickbacks to physicians to prescribe GSK's drugs. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers' fees at conferences, and payment for articles ghostwritten by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals. The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia.\n\nAs part of the settlement GSK signed a five-year corporate integrity agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services, which obliged the company to make major changes in the way it did business, including changing its compensation programmes for its sales force and executives, and to implement and maintain transparency in its research practices and publication policies. It announced in 2013 that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets.\n\nThe 2012 settlement included a criminal fine of $242,612,800 for failing to report safety data to the FDA about Avandia (rosiglitazone), a diabetes drug approved in 1999, and a civil settlement of $657 million for making false claims about it. The Justice Department said GSK had promoted rosiglitazone to physicians with misleading information, including that it conferred cardiovascular benefits despite an FDA-mandated label warning of cardiovascular risks.\n\nIn 1999 John Buse, a diabetes specialist, told medical conferences that rosiglitazone might carry an increased risk of cardiovascular problems. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction. GSK raised questions internally about the drug's safety in 2000, and in 2002 the company ghostwrote an article in \"Circulation\" describing a GSK funded clinical trial that suggested rosiglitazone might have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk. From 2001 reports began to link the thiazolidinediones (the class of drugs to which rosiglitazone belongs) to heart failure. In April that year GSK began a six-year, open-label, randomized trial, known as RECORD, to examine rosiglitazone and cardiovascular events. Two GSK meta-analyses in 2005 and 2006 showed an increased risk of cardiovascular problems with rosiglitazone; the information was passed to the FDA and posted on the company website, but not otherwise published. By December 2006 rosiglitazone had become the top-selling diabetes drug, with annual sales of US$3.3 billion.\n\nIn June 2007 the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" published a meta-analysis that associated the drug with an increased risk of heart attack. GSK had reportedly tried to persuade one of the authors, Steven Nissen, not to publish it, after receiving an advance copy from one of the journal's peer reviewers, a GSK consultant. In July 2007 FDA scientists suggested that rosiglitazone had caused 83,000 excess heart attacks between 1999 and 2007. The FDA placed restrictions on the drug, including adding a boxed warning, but did not withdraw it. (In 2013 the FDA rejected that the drug had caused excess heart attacks.) A Senate Finance Committee inquiry concluded in 2010 that GSK had sought to intimidate scientists who had concerns about rosiglitazone. In February that year the company tried to halt publication of an editorial about the controversy by Nissen in the \"European Heart Journal\".\n\nThe results of GSK's RECORD trial were published in June 2009. It confirmed an association between rosiglitazone and an increased risk of heart failure and fractures, but not of heart attack, and concluded that it \"does not increase the risk of overall cardiovascular morbidity or mortality compared with standard glucose-lowering drugs.\" Steven Nissan and Kathy Wolkski argued that the study's low event rates reduced its statistical power. In September 2009 rosiglitazone was suspended in Europe. The results of the RECORD study were confirmed in 2013 by the Duke Clinical Research Institute, in an independent review required by the FDA. In November that year the FDA lifted the restrictions it had placed on the drug. The boxed warning about heart attack was removed; the warning about heart failure remained in place.\n\nGSK was fined for promoting Paxil/Seroxat (paroxetine) for treating depression in the under-18s, although the drug had not been approved for pediatric use.\nPaxil had $4.97 billion worldwide sales in 2003. The company conducted nine clinical trials between 1994 and 2002, none of which showed that Paxil helped children with depression. From 1998 to 2003 it promoted the drug for the under-18s, paying physicians to go on all-expenses paid trips, five-star hotels and spas. From 2004 Paxil's label, along with those of similar drugs, included an FDA-mandated boxed warning that it might increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients under 18.\n\nAn internal SmithKline Beecham document said in 1998, about withheld data from two GSK studies: \"It would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that [pediatric] efficacy had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine.\" The company ghostwrote an article, published in 2001 in the \"Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\", that misreported the results of one of its clinical trials, Study 329. The article concluded that Paxil was \"generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents.\" The suppression of the research findings is the subject of \"Side Effects\" (2008) by Alison Bass.\n\nFor 10 years GSK marketed Paxil as non-habit forming. In 2001 35 patients filed a class-action suit alleging they had suffered withdrawal symptoms, and in 2002, a Los Angeles court issued an injunction preventing GSK from advertising that the drug was not habit forming. The court withdrew the injunction after the FDA objected that the court had no jurisdiction over drug marketing that the FDA had approved. In 2003, a World Health Organization committee reported that Paxil was among the top 30 drugs, and top three antidepressants, for which dependence had been reported.\n\nThe company was also fined for promoting Wellbutrin (bupropion) – approved at the time for major depressive disorder and also sold as a smoking-cessation aid, Zyban – for weight loss and the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sexual dysfunction and substance addiction. GSK paid doctors to promote these off-label uses, and set up supposedly independent advisory boards and Continuing Medical Education programmes.\n\nIn the 1960s Glaxo Group Ltd. (Glaxo) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) each owned patents covering various aspects of the antifungal drug griseofulvin. They created a patent pool by cross-licensing their patents, subject to express licensing restrictions that the chemical from which the \"finished\" form of the drug (tablets and capsules) was made must not be resold in bulk form, and they licensed other drug companies to sell the drug in finished form and subject to similar restrictions. The effect and intent of the bulk-sale restriction was to keep the drug chemical out of the hands of small companies that might act as price-cutters, and the effect was to maintain stable, uniform prices.\n\nThe United States brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—\"United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.\"—charging them with violation of the Sherman Act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid. The trial court found that the defendants had engaged in several unlawful conspiracies, but dismissed the part of the suit seeking invalidation of patents and refused to grant as relief mandatory sales of the bulk drug chemical and compulsory licensing of the patents. The government appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed, in \"United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.\", 410 U.S. 52 (1973).\n\nThere were concerns in the 2000s about the sugar and vitamin content of Ribena, a blackcurrant-based syrup and soft drink owned by GSK until 2013. Produced in England by H.W. Carter & Co from the 1930s, the company's unbranded syrup was distributed to children as a source of vitamin C during World War II, which gave the drink a reputation as good for health. Beecham bought H. W. Carter in 1955.\n\nIn 2001 the British Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) required GSK to withdraw its claim that Ribena Toothkind, a lower-sugar variety, did not encourage tooth decay. A company poster showed bottles of Toothkind in place of the bristles on a toothbrush. The ASA's ruling was upheld by the High Court. In 2007 GSK was fined $217,000 in New Zealand over its claim that ready-to-drink Ribena contained high levels of vitamin C, after it was found to contain no detectable vitamin C. In 2013 GSK sold Ribena and another drink, Lucozade, to the Japanese multinational Suntory for £1.35 billion.\n\nIn 2010 the US Department of Justice announced that GSK would pay a $150 million criminal fine and forfeiture, and a civil settlement of $600 million under the False Claims Act. The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001 to 2005 at GSK's subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced $5.5 billion of products each year. The drugs involved were Kytril, an antiemetic; Bactroban, used to treat skin infections; Paxil, the anti-depressant; and Avandamet, a diabetes drug. GSK closed the factory in 2009.\n\nAccording to the \"New York Times\", the case began in 2002 when GSK sent experts to fix problems cited by the FDA. The lead inspector recommended recalls of defective products, but they were not authorised; she was fired in 2003 and filed a whistleblower lawsuit. In 2005 federal marshals seized $2 billion worth of products, the largest such seizure in history. In the 2010 settlement SB Pharmco plead guilty to criminal charges, and agreed to pay $150 million in a criminal fine and forfeiture, at that time the largest such payment ever by a manufacturer of adulterated drugs, and $600 million in civil penalties to settle the civil lawsuit.\n\nIn 2013 Chinese authorities announced that, since 2007, GSK had funnelled HK$3.8 billion in kickbacks to GSK managers, doctors, hospitals and others who prescribed their drugs, using over 700 travel agencies and consulting firms. Chinese authorities arrested four GSK executives as part of a four-month investigation into claims that doctors were bribed with cash and sexual favours. In 2014 a Chinese court found the company guilty of bribery and imposed a fine of $490 million. Mark Reilly, the British head of GSK's Chinese operations, received a three-year suspended prison sentence after a one-day trial held in secret. Reilly was reportedly deported from China and dismissed by the company.\n\nIn February 2016 the company was fined over £37 million in the UK by the Competition and Markets Authority for paying Generics UK, Alpharma and Norton Healthcare more than £50m between 2001 and 2004 to keep generic varieties of paroxetine out of the UK market. The generics companies were fined a further £8 million. At the end of 2003, when generics became available in the UK, the price of paroxetine dropped by 70 percent.\n\nItalian police sought bribery charges in May 2004 against 4,400 doctors and 273 GSK employees. GSK and its predecessor were accused of having spent £152m on physicians, pharmacists and others, giving them cameras, computers, holidays and cash. Doctors were alleged to have received cash based on the number of patients they treated with a cancer drug, topotecan (Hycamtin). The following month prosecutors in Munich accused 70–100 doctors of having accepted bribes from SmithKline Beecham between 1997 and 1999. The inquiry was opened over allegations that the company had given over 4,000 hospital doctors money and free trips. All charges were dismissed by the Verona court in January 2009.\n\nIn 2006 in the United States GSK settled the largest tax dispute in IRS history, agreeing to pay $3.1 billion. At issue were Zantac and other products sold in 1989–2005. The case revolved around intracompany transfer pricing—determining the share of profit attributable to the US subsidiaries of GSK and subject to tax by the IRS.\n\nThe UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) opened a criminal inquiry in 2014 into GSK's sales practices, using powers granted by the Bribery Act 2010. The SFO said it was collaborating with Chinese authorities to investigate bringing charges in the UK related to GSK's activities in China, Europe and the Middle East. Also as of 2014 the US Department of Justice was investigating GSK with reference to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nThe following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list):\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21454098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21454098", "title": "Hircocervus", "text": "Hircocervus\n\nThe hircocervus (, \"billy goat\" + \"cervus\", \"stag\") or tragelaph (, \"billy goat\" + έλαφος, \"elaphos\", \"stag\"), also known as a goat-stag or horse-stag, was a legendary creature imagined to be half-goat, half-stag.\n\nIn his work \"De Interpretatione\", Aristotle utilized the idea of a fabulous goat-stag to express the philosophical concept of something that is knowable even though it does not really exist. In Plato's \"Republic\", Socrates speaks of his own image-making as similar to that of painters who paint goat-stags, combining the features of different things together (488a).\n\nThe word \"hircocervus\" first appears in the English language in a medieval manuscript dating from 1398 (now at the Bodleian Library).\n\nA hircocervus is depicted in a wall-painting called \"The Trusty Servant\", painted by John Hoskins in 1579. It hangs outside the kitchen of Winchester College in Hampshire, England. The author Arthur Cleveland Coxe described \"the time-honoured \"Hircocervus\", or picture of 'the Trusty-servant,' which hangs near the kitchen, and which emblematically sets forth those virtues in domestics, of which we Americans know nothing. It is a figure, part man, part porker, part deer, and part donkey; with a padlock on his mouth, and various other symbols in his hands and about his person, the whole signifying a most valuable character.\"\n\nThe painting of \"The Trusty Servant\" had a didactic function: it is accompanied by allegorical verses that associate the hircocervus servant's various animal parts with distinctive virtues that the students of Winchester College were meant to follow.\n\nThe Latin verses have been translated into English as:\n<poem>\nA trusty servant's picture would you see,\nThis figure well survey, who'ever you be.\nThe porker's snout not nice in diet shows; \nThe padlock shut, no secret he'll disclose; \nPatient, to angry lords the ass gives ear;\nSwiftness on errand, the stag's feet declare;\nLaden his left hand, apt to labour saith;\nThe coat his neatness; the open hand his faith;\nGirt with his sword, his shield upon his arm,\nHimself and master he'll protect from harm.</poem>\n\nUmberto Eco refers to a hircocervus in his novel \"The Island of the Day Before\".\n\nMartin Luther uses the term \"Goat-stag\" (\"tragelaphus\" in his Latin) in his \"Theses Against the Antinomians\" (1540, Sixth Set) to describe \"a law that does not condemn\". Luther is stating that one can imagine a law from God that only instructs or teaches without threatening and condemning human sin. However, Luther claims that such a law, often sought by theologians throughout Christian history, does not actually exist.\n\nIn 2014 Winchester College commissioned a medal by Old Wykehamist Anthony Smith to be awarded to staff in recognition of \"Long And Loyal Service\". The medal features a relief sculpture of the \"hircocervus\", as it appears in \"The Trusty Servant\" painting.\n"}

The term was coined in Charles Platt's 1991 novel \"The Silicon Man\", where it refers to a single biological consciousness transferred into a computer through a process of mind transfer. In the book, a character refers to an infomorph as \"intelligence held in a computer memory\", and an \"information entity\".\n\nWhether the vision shared in Platt’s novel will ever be more than a theory is uncertain, but computing power is still increasing exponentially (see Moore's law for more details), and the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University have considered the philosophical and technical feasibility of this theory at some point in the future.\n\nThe Institute considers it theoretically possible to understand the absolute workings of every aspect of the mind, and the ability to measure this in a specific individual, although Heisenberg's uncertainty principle may apply if it is discovered that the brain's workings on a quantum scale are relevant to the workings of the mind. However, the rate of appreciation of knowledge in neuroscience and psychology is far slower than the rate of increase in computing power. There are also philosophical questions to be answered, the most important being the nature of consciousness and whether it is possible to transfer a consciousness or if this transfer would effectively be a copy.\n\nAmber Case, a pioneer of cyborg anthropology, considers users of social networks to be \"partial infomorphs\", along with people whose writing is left behind after their death. She talks of an \"informorphic footprint\", corresponding to the size of information created and distributed during a person's lifetime.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1495134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1495134", "title": "Insular cortex", "text": "Insular cortex\n\nIn each hemisphere of the mammalian brain the insular cortex (also insula and insular lobe) is a portion of the cerebral cortex folded deep within the lateral sulcus (the fissure separating the temporal lobe from the parietal and frontal lobes).\n\nThe insulae are believed to be involved in consciousness and play a role in diverse functions usually linked to emotion or the regulation of the body's homeostasis. These functions include compassion and empathy, perception, motor control, self-awareness, cognitive functioning, and interpersonal experience. In relation to these, it is involved in psychopathology.\n\nThe insular cortex is divided into two parts: the larger anterior insula and the smaller posterior insula in which more than a dozen field areas have been identified. The cortical area overlying the insula toward the lateral surface of the brain is the operculum (meaning \"lid\"). The opercula are formed from parts of the enclosing frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.\n\nThe anterior part of the insula is subdivided by shallow sulci into three or four short gyri.\n\nThe anterior insula receives a direct projection from the basal part of the ventral medial nucleus of the thalamus and a particularly large input from the central nucleus of the amygdala. In addition, the anterior insula itself projects to the amygdala.\n\nOne study on rhesus monkeys revealed widespread reciprocal connections between the insular cortex and almost all subnuclei of the amygdaloid complex. The posterior insula projects predominantly to the dorsal aspect of the lateral and to the central amygdaloid nuclei. In contrast, the anterior insula projects to the anterior amygdaloid area as well as the medial, the cortical, the accessory basal magnocellular, the medial basal, and the lateral amygdaloid nuclei.\n\nThe posterior part of the insula is formed by a long gyrus.\n\nThe posterior insula connects reciprocally with the secondary somatosensory cortex and receives input from spinothalamically activated ventral posterior inferior thalamic nuclei. It has also been shown that this region receives inputs from the ventromedial nucleus (posterior part) of the thalamus that are highly specialized to convey homeostatic information such as pain, temperature, itch, local oxygen status, and sensual touch.\n\nA human neuroimaging study using diffusion tensor imaging revealed that the anterior insula is interconnected to regions in the temporal and occipital lobe, opercular and orbitofrontal cortex, triangular and opercular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus. The same study revealed differences in the anatomical connection patterns between the left and right hemisphere.\n\nThe 'circular sulcus of insula' (or sulcus of Reil)is a semi-circular sulcus or \"fissure\" that separates the insula from the neighboring gyri of the operculum in the front, above, and\nbehind.\n\nThe insular cortex has regions of variable cell structure or cytoarchitecture, changing from granular in the posterior portion to agranular in the anterior portion. The insula also receives differential cortical and thalamic input along its length. John Allman and his colleagues have shown that the anterior insular cortex contains a population of neurons, called spindle neurons. These are also called \"von Economo neurons\", identified as characterising a distinctive subregion as the agranular frontal insula.\n\nThe insular cortex is considered a separate lobe of the telencephalon by some authorities. Other sources see the insula as a part of the temporal lobe. It is also sometimes grouped with limbic structures deep in the brain into a limbic lobe. As a paralimbic cortex, the insular cortex is considered to be a relatively old structure.\n\nFunctional imaging studies show activation of the insula during audio-visual integration tasks.\n\nThere is evidence that, in addition to its base functions, the insula may play a role in certain higher-level functions that operate only in humans and other great apes. The spindle neurons found at a higher density in the right frontal insular cortex are also found in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is another region that has reached a high level of specialization in great apes. It has been speculated that these neurons are involved in cognitive-emotional processes that are specific to primates including great apes, such as empathy and metacognitive emotional feelings. This is supported by functional imaging results showing that the structure and function of the right frontal insula is correlated with the ability to feel one's own heartbeat, or to empathize with the pain of others. It is thought that these functions are not distinct from the lower-level functions of the insula but rather arise as a consequence of the role of the insula in conveying homeostatic information to consciousness. The right anterior insula aids interoceptive awareness of body states, such as the ability to time one's own heartbeat. Moreover, greater right anterior insular gray matter volume correlates with increased accuracy in this subjective sense of the inner body, and with negative emotional experience. It is also involved in the control of blood pressure, in particular during and after exercise, and its activity varies with the amount of effort a person believes he/she is exerting.\n\nThe insular cortex also is where the sensation of pain is judged as to its degree. Further, the insula is where a person imagines pain when looking at images of painful events while thinking about their happening to one's own body. Those with irritable bowel syndrome have abnormal processing of visceral pain in the insular cortex related to dysfunctional inhibition of pain within the brain.\n\nAnother perception of the right anterior insula is the degree of nonpainful warmth or nonpainful coldness of a skin sensation. Other internal sensations processed by the insula include stomach or abdominal distension. A full bladder also activates the insular cortex.\n\nOne brain imaging study suggests that the unpleasantness of subjectively perceived dyspnea is processed in the right human anterior insula and amygdala.\n\nThe cerebral cortex processing vestibular sensations extends into the insula, with small lesions in the anterior insular cortex being able to cause loss of balance and vertigo.\n\nOther noninteroceptive perceptions include passive listening to music, laughter, and crying, empathy and compassion, and language.\n\nIn motor control, it contributes to hand-and-eye motor movement, swallowing, gastric motility, and speech articulation. It has been identified as a \"central command” centre that ensures that heart rate and blood pressure increase at the onset of exercise. Research upon conversation links it to the capacity for long and complex spoken sentences. It is also involved in motor learning and has been identified as playing a role in the motor recovery from stroke.\n\nIt plays a role in a variety of homeostatic functions related to basic survival needs, such as taste, visceral sensation, and autonomic control. The insula controls autonomic functions through the regulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. It has a role in regulating the immune system.\n\nIt has been identified as playing a role in the experience of bodily self-awareness, sense of agency, and sense of body ownership.\n\nThe anterior insula processes a person's sense of disgust both to smells and to the sight of contamination and mutilation — even when just imagining the experience. This associates with a mirror neuron-like link between external and internal experiences.\n\nIn social experience, it is involved in the processing of norm violations, emotional processing, empathy, and orgasms.\n\nThe insula is active during social decision making. Tiziana Quarto et al. measured emotional intelligence (EI) (the ability to identify, regulate, and process emotions of themselves and of others) of sixty-three healthy subjects. Using fMRI EI was measured in correlation with left insular activity. The subjects were shown various pictures of facial expressions and tasked with deciding to approach or avoid the person in the picture. The results of the social decision task yielded that individuals with high EI scores had left insular activation when processing fearful faces. Individuals with low EI scores had left insular activation when processing angry faces.\n\nThe insular cortex, in particular its most anterior portion, is considered a limbic-related cortex. The insula has increasingly become the focus of attention for its role in body representation and subjective emotional experience. In particular, Antonio Damasio has proposed that this region plays a role in mapping visceral states that are associated with emotional experience, giving rise to conscious feelings. This is in essence a neurobiological formulation of the ideas of William James, who first proposed that subjective emotional experience (i.e., feelings) arise from our brain's interpretation of bodily states that are elicited by emotional events. This is an example of embodied cognition.\n\nIn terms of function, the insula is believed to process convergent information to produce an \"emotionally relevant context for sensory experience\". To be specific, the anterior insula is related more to \"olfactory, gustatory, viscero-autonomic, and limbic function\", whereas the posterior insula is related more to \"auditory-somesthetic-skeletomotor\" function. Functional imaging experiments have revealed that the insula has an important role in pain experience and the experience of a number of basic emotions, including anger, fear, disgust, happiness, and sadness.\n\nThe anterior insular cortex (AIC) is believed to be responsible for emotional feelings, including maternal and romantic love, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, sexual arousal, disgust, aversion, unfairness, inequity, indignation, uncertainty, disbelief, social exclusion, trust, empathy, sculptural beauty, a ‘state of union with God’, and hallucinogenic states.\n\nFunctional imaging studies have also implicated the insula in conscious desires, such as food craving and drug craving. What is common to all of these emotional states is that they each change the body in some way and are associated with highly salient subjective qualities. The insula is well-situated for the integration of information relating to bodily states into higher-order cognitive and emotional processes. The insula receives information from \"homeostatic afferent\" sensory pathways via the thalamus and sends output to a number of other limbic-related structures, such as the amygdala, the ventral striatum, and the orbitofrontal cortex, as well as to motor cortices.\n\nA study using magnetic resonance imaging found that the right anterior insula is significantly thicker in people that meditate. Other research into brain activity and meditation has shown an increase in grey matter in areas of the brain including the insular cortex.\n\nAnother study using voxel-based morphometry and MRI on experienced Vipassana meditators was done to extend the findings of Lazar et al., which found increased grey matter concentrations in this and other areas of the brain in experienced meditators.\n\nThe strongest evidence against a causative role for the insula cortex in emotion comes from Damasio et al. (2012) which showed that a patient who suffered bilateral lesions of the insula cortex expressed the full complement of human emotions, and was fully capable of emotional learning.\n\nFunctional neuroimaging research suggests the insula is involved in two types of salience. Interoceptive information processing that links interoception with emotional salience to generate a subjective representation of the body. This involves, first, the anterior insular cortex with the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann area 33) and the anterior and posterior mid-cingulate cortices, and, second, a general salience network concerned with environmental monitoring, response selection, and skeletomotor body orientation that involves all of the insular cortex and the mid-cingulate cortex.\n\nAn alternative or perhaps complementary proposal is that the right anterior insular regulates the interaction between the salience of the selective attention created to achieve a task (the dorsal attention system) and the salience of arousal created to keep focused upon the relevant part of the environment (ventral attention system). This regulation of salience might be particularly important during challenging tasks where attention might fatigue and so cause careless mistakes but if there is too much arousal it risks creating poor performance by turning into anxiety.\n\nProgressive expressive aphasia is the deterioration of normal language function that causes individuals to lose the ability to communicate fluently while still being able to comprehend single words and intact other non-linguistic cognition. It is found in a variety of degenerative neurological conditions including Pick's disease, motor neuron disease, corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. It is associated with hypometabolism and atrophy of the left anterior insular cortex.\n\nA number of functional brain imaging studies have shown that the insular cortex is activated when drug abusers are exposed to environmental cues that trigger cravings. This has been shown for a variety of drugs, including cocaine, alcohol, opiates, and nicotine. Despite these findings, the insula has been ignored within the drug addiction literature, perhaps because it is not known to be a direct target of the mesocortical dopamine system, which is central to current dopamine reward theories of addiction. Research published in 2007 has shown that cigarette smokers suffering damage to the insular cortex, from a stroke for instance, have their addiction to cigarettes practically eliminated. These individuals were found to be up to 136 times more likely to undergo a disruption of smoking addiction than smokers with damage in other areas. Disruption of addiction was evidenced by self-reported behavior changes such as quitting smoking less than one day after the brain injury, quitting smoking with great ease, not smoking again after quitting, and having no urge to resume smoking since quitting. The study was conducted on average eight years after the strokes, which opens up the possibility that recall bias could have affected the results. More recent prospective studies, which overcome this limitation, have corroborated these findings This suggests a significant role for the insular cortex in the neurological mechanisms underlying addiction to nicotine and other drugs, and would make this area of the brain a possible target for novel anti-addiction medication. In addition, this finding suggests that functions mediated by the insula, especially conscious feelings, may be particularly important for maintaining drug addiction, although this view is not represented in any modern research or reviews of the subject.\n\nA recent study in rats by Contreras et al. corroborates these findings by showing that reversible inactivation of the insula disrupts amphetamine conditioned place preference, an animal model of cue-induced drug craving. In this study, insula inactivation also disrupted \"malaise\" responses to lithium chloride injection, suggesting that the representation of negative interoceptive states by the insula plays a role in addiction. However, in this same study, the conditioned place preference took place immediately after the injection of amphetamine, suggesting that it is the immediate, pleasurable interoceptive effects of amphetamine administration, rather than the delayed, aversive effects of amphetamine withdrawal that are represented within the insula.\n\nA model proposed by Naqvi et al. (see above) is that the insula stores a representation of the pleasurable interoceptive effects of drug use (e.g., the airway sensory effects of nicotine, the cardiovascular effects of amphetamine), and that this representation is activated by exposure to cues that have previously been associated with drug use. A number of functional imaging studies have shown the insula to be activated during the administration of drugs of abuse. Several functional imaging studies have also shown that the insula is activated when drug users are exposed to drug cues, and that this activity is correlated with subjective urges. In the cue-exposure studies, insula activity is elicited when there is no actual change in the level of drug in the body. Therefore, rather than merely representing the interoceptive effects of drug use as it occurs, the insula may play a role in memory for the pleasurable interoceptive effects of past drug use, anticipation of these effects in the future, or both. Such a representation may give rise to conscious urges that feel as if they arise from within the body. This may make addicts feel as if their bodies need to use a drug, and may result in persons with lesions in the insula reporting that their bodies have forgotten the urge to use, according to this study.\n\nA common quality in mystical experiences is a strong feeling of certainty which cannot be expressed in words. Fabienne Picard proposes a neurological explanation for this subjective certainty, based on clinical research of epilepsy. \nAccording to Picard, this feeling of certainty may be caused by a dysfunction of the anterior insula, a part of the brain which is involved in interoception, self-reflection, and in avoiding uncertainty about the internal representations of the world by \"anticipation of resolution of uncertainty or risk\". This avoidance of uncertainty functions through the comparison between predicted states and actual states, that is, \"signaling that we do not understand, i.e., that there is ambiguity.\" Picard notes that \"the concept of insight is very close to that of certainty,\" and refers to Archimedes' \"Eureka!\" Picard hypothesizes that during ecstatic seizures the comparison between predicted states and actual states no longer functions, and that mismatches between predicted state and actual state are no longer processed, blocking \"negative emotions and negative arousal arising from predictive uncertainty,\" which will be experienced as emotional confidence. Picard concludes that \"[t]his could lead to a spiritual interpretation in some individuals.\"\n\nThe insular cortex has been suggested to have a role in anxiety disorders, emotion dysregulation, and anorexia nervosa.\n\nThe insula was first described by Johann Christian Reil while describing cranial and spinal nerves and plexi. Henry Gray in Gray's Anatomy is responsible for it being known as the \"Island of Reil\".\n\n\n"}

The couple's first child, a son named Langdon, died of diphtheria at age 19 months. She had two older sisters: Susy and Clara. According to \"Mark Twain's Autobiography\", Jean Clemens, like her mother, was a kind-hearted person and particularly fond of animals. She founded or worked with a number of societies for the protection of animals in the various locations where she lived.\n\nShe had epilepsy from age fifteen, which her father attributed to a head injury she had suffered at age eight or nine. The family spent years seeking cures in the United States and Europe. Twain also attributed her mood swings and sometimes erratic behavior to her uncontrolled epilepsy.\n\nOlivia Langdon Clemens tried to include her daughter in family life despite her illness, but after her death in 1904 it was left to Twain and Jean's older sister Clara to manage her and the difficulties her illness caused.

Jean was sent to an epilepsy colony in Katonah, New York in the fall of 1906 and her father denied her requests to come home, fearing that he could not care for her.

He also served in the House of Representatives, serving the second district of Maryland from 1811 to 1815 and again from 1819 to 1826, and as the 19th Governor of Maryland from 1826 to 1829.\n\nBorn on January 14, 1779 in Calvert County, Maryland. He was the son of Daniel Kent, Sr. (1754–1805) and Anne Weems Wheeler (1761–1823). Joseph Kent received a liberal schooling at Lower Marlboro Academy, and studied medicine. He was admitted to medical practice in Lower Marlborough, Calvert County in 1799 with a Doctor Parran, but ceased relations with Parran after a political disagreement in 1801.\n\nJoseph married first, Eleanor Lee Contee Wallace (1782–1826) on October 30, 1804. Eleanor was born December 9, 1782 in Prince George's County, Maryland. She died August 14, 1826. Eleanor was the daughter Dr. Michael Wallace, Jr., Esq. (1749–1794) and Eleanor Lee Contee (1758–1786). Their daughter, Adelaide MacKubin Kent, would marry Thomas Pratt, another Governor of Maryland and U.S. Senator.\n\nKent purchased a estate named \"Rosemount\" near Bladensburg, Maryland, and settled there around 1807. \"Rosemount\" is part of the large estate, \"Park Hall\", owned by the Gantt family in 1735, about which time it was divided and sold. Joseph gave the name \"Rosemount\". He was passionately fond of roses and the old terraced garden was kept profusely planted with lilies and roses, justifying his choice of the new name he had given his home.\n\nHe continued the practice of medicine and also engaged in farming on his estate. In 1807, Dr. Kent removed to the vicinity of Bladensburg and entered the Maryland State Militia as a Surgeon's mate, in the 34th Regiment of the Maryland Militia. In 1809 he was made a full surgeon, but resigned. In the militia, Kent received the rank of a Lieutenant Colonel, and finally as a Colonel of the Cavalry of the 2nd Maryland Militia Cavalry.\n\nJoseph presided at the first public meeting in Washington for the organization of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, in which he became a director.\n\nTurning to politics, Joseph was elected to the United States Congress in 1810 taking his seat on March 4, 1811 and served several years until March 3, 1815. Though a Federalist, opposing War with Great Britain, he voted with the Republican party in declaring War. He was a Presidential Elector in 1816, casting his vote for James Monroe (1758–1831). He later broke with the Federalist party and by the time of the next election he was a Democratic-Republican, in which he was elected to another term in the House of Representatives from March 4, 1819 until he resigned on January 6, 1826. In his second tenure in Congress, Kent continued as chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia.\n\nJoseph was elected Governor of Maryland in 1826. The primary goal of Kent's administration as governor was to work toward internal improvements. He was in support of improving internal transportation, including expanding the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The immense cost of these projects, however, were never fully repudiated until several decades after Kent's administration, and placed the state under immense financial burden for many years aftwards.\n\nOther areas of interest for Kent included prison reform, separating presidential voting into districts, and for increased funding for schools and colleges. He also sought to improve the maintenance of the state's records, \"so indispensably necessary to its correct history\" as he said.\n\nJoseph married Alice Lee Contee (1803–1868) on July 8, 1828 at \"Bromont\", near Newburg, Charles Co., Maryland. Alice was born at \"Bromont\", near Newburg, Charles Co., Maryland. She died August 24, 1868. Alice was the a first cousin of Joseph's first wife, Eleanor Lee Contee Wallace (1782–1826). Alice was the daughter of Capt. Benjamin Contee, Rev., Hon. (1755–1815) and Sarah Russell Lee (1766–1810).\n\nKent was elected as a Republican (later Whig) to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1833, until his death at his home, \"Rosemount,\" near Bladensburg. He served as chairman of the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia (Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Congresses). As senator, Kent was opposed to the Bank of the United States, and offered a resolution asking for negotiations with France regarding lower tobacco prices and restricting the importing of tobacco. However, although this resolution passed, it was not widely popular.\n\nDue to ill health, Kent attended only four sessions of the Senate, and died in 1837 as a result of a fall from his horse. He is buried in an unmarked grave at his home of \"Rosemount\".\n\n\n"}

It is the last installment in Kaurismäki's \"Finland\" trilogy after \"Drifting Clouds\" (1996) and \"The Man Without a Past\" (2002).\n\nThe film is about a security guard who is set up in a robbery by a femme fatale who exploits his gullibility and loyalty. Classical music is used as background throughout much of the film, including excerpts from the work of the famous Swedish tenor Jussi Björling.\n\nIt has been argued that the film deals with the ways in which \"[c]apitalism has painted the town red, just a different shade of red from its socialist connotations,\" as well as that \"rock is so important to the director that a number of his males, including Koistinen, favor a 50s, greasy, sweptback hair style, to go along with their love of rock 'n' roll (definitely a reminder of how rock was the way to rebel in socialist countries).\"\n\nKoistinen (Janne Hyytiäinen) is a lonely nightwatchman tasked with guarding a shopping mall. He attempts to socialize, but is treated coldly by his manager and subjected to mocking by his colleagues. While he is drinking alone in a bar, he catches the eye of some criminals headed by Lindholm (Ilkka Koivula) who learn of his occupation. Koistinen's only human contact is the grill vendor Aila (Maria Heiskanen) to whom he outlines his plans of starting his own company.\n\nWhile at work, Koistinen notices a dog left outside a pub without water. While he is taking a break, Mirja (Maria Järvenhelmi) approaches him, saying he seems lonely. They agree to go on a date together. Returning from his break, Koistinen meets a young boy in front of the pub and asks if he knows the owners of the dog. Despite the boy's warning, Koistinen confronts the owners in the pub and is beaten off-camera.\n\nKoistinen and Mirja go on a date. They talk little, and at a concert Koistinen watches as Mirja goes dancing on her own with other men. Despite this, they agree to meet again. Koistinen returns to Aila's grill and talks about his evening. Insulted, Aila asks him to leave and closes shop. Meanwhile, Mirja meets with Lindholm for her payment and ridicules Koistinen. Lindholm informs his contacts of an \"open-door day.\"\n\nKoistinen seeks a loan to start his own business, but is harshly refused at the bank due to his insufficient education and lack of guarantors. Later, Mirja unexpectedly joins Koistinen while he is taking his rounds. While Koistinen explains the mall's security system, Mirja memorizes the security code he uses. She gives the code to Lindholm, who tells her to start cooling the fake relationship off.\n\nMirja meets Koistinen at his place, but abruptly leaves when he attempts to put his arm around her. Koistinen begins to drink heavily, and ends up at Aila's grill. Aila walks him home and puts him to bed.\n\nAt work, one of Koistinen's colleagues mockingly asks about his successes with women. Koistinen grabs the man, but stops himself from striking him and goes to his rounds. Mirja meets him and asks him to come and talk. Koistinen signs off and leaves with Mirja in his car. Mirja drugs Koistinen and passes his keys to one of Lindholm's contacts. Using Koistinen's keys and security code, the thieves rob a jewellery store at the mall.\n\nThe police question Koistinen, but he claims to have been alone and drunk. He is released due to lack of proof, but is fired from his job. On Lindholm's insistence, Mirja meets with Koistinen at his apartment once again to plant evidence. Koistinen notices her hiding the evidence, but does not stop her and lets himself be arrested by the police. He is sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nKoistinen initially remains lonely in prison, tearing up a letter Aila sends him. Just as Koistinen begins to have some contact to other inmates, he is released a year early on parole. He finds lodgings at a night shelter and gets a job as a restaurant's dishwasher. He runs into Aila, but soon excuses himself. However, Aila comes to see him at the night shelter and asks about his plans for the future. When Koistinen says he plans to open a garage once he's back on his feet, she congratulates him for not losing hope. They agree to see each other again.\n\nKoistinen sees Mirja and Lindholm at the restaurant where he is working, but does not confront them. Lindholm calls up the head waitress and tells about Koistinen's criminal record, which results in him being fired immediately. Koistinen gets a knife from the night shelter and returns to the restaurant. As Lindholm and Mirja are leaving, he attacks Lindholm, but only manages to cut his hand while being disarmed and subdued by Lindholm's thugs. The thugs offer to kill Koistinen, but Lindholm refuses, saying he is a businessman and not a murderer. The young boy who warned Koistinen earlier sees the thugs take him away and finds Aila. They discover the badly beaten Koistinen in the harbour, along with the dog Koistinen attempted to help earlier. Aila offers to get help but Koistinen asks her to stay. When she asks him not to die, Koistinen replies \"I won't die yet\" and puts his hand on hers.\n\n\nThe film was chosen as Finland's nominee for the 79th Academy Awards in the category of Best Foreign Language Film. However, Kaurismäki decided to boycott the awards and refused the nomination as a protest against US President George W. Bush's foreign policy. Kaurismäki also boycotted the 2002 gala, when his previous film \"The Man Without a Past\" (2002) was nominated for an Oscar.\n\n\"Lights in the Dusk\" received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 71%, based on 41 critics, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"From its brilliant cinematography to its compassionate characters, \"Lights in the Dusk\" is another successful exercise in deadpan minimalist comedy from Aki Kaurismäki.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 57 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\n"}

Gene Kelly had a special affection for her and included her in each of his films following her role in \"An American in Paris\".\n\nBlake was born in Kinsley in Edwards County, south-central Kansas, to Albert Cummings and the former Alice Stone. Her father was a Methodist circuit rider who discouraged her from becoming an actress, thus she did not enter acting until later in life, despite her family's relocation from Kansas to Southern California.\n\nDuring World War II, Blake and her husband James Lincoln Blake worked in Utah on construction of the detonator for the atomic bomb and performed such jobs as testing equipment destined for the Manhattan Project. The couple received a citation for their work from the U.S. government.\n\nAlthough five years his senior, Blake was a niece of actor Milburn Stone, who filled the role of Doc Adams on CBS's \"Gunsmoke\" Western series. She did not begin to study acting until she was 50 years old, when she enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse and took advantage of whatever influence or contacts Milburn Stone had to land acting roles. In the middle 1950s, Blake appeared on Rod Cameron's \"City Detective\" syndicated crime drama and in Ray Milland's sitcom, \"Meet Mr. McNutley\", renamed in the second season as \"The Ray Milland Show\". Blake appeared in four episodes of the NBC sitcom \"It's a Great Life\" (1954–1956) and twice on CBS's \"December Bride\", with Spring Byington.\n\nBlake portrayed gushy gossip columnist Dora Bailey in \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952) and was a model for one of the fairies in Walt Disney's animated version of \"Sleeping Beauty\" (1959). She appeared as Mrs. Porter, a babysitter, in the 1959 pilot of CBS's \"Dennis the Menace\". About this time, she was cast in a guest-starring role in the sitcoms, \"Guestward, Ho!\", with Joanne Dru on ABC, and \"Angel\", with Annie Fargé on CBS. In 1961, she guest-starred in the episode \"A View of Murder\" of the syndicated crime drama \"The Brothers Brannagan\". Blake's Flora MacMichael was a romantic foil to Walter Brennan's Grandpa Amos McCoy on \"The Real McCoys\", a situation comedy about a West Virginia mountain family that relocated to Southern California.\n\nPrior to her role in \"Batman\", she had a recurring role on \"The Jack Benny Program\" as the president of the Jack Benny Fan Club - Pasadena Chapter. She played Millie Brinkerhoff in the episode \"Instant Wedding\" in the 1963 NBC military drama \"The Lieutenant\" starring Gary Lockwood in the title role. Blake appeared in the pilot episode of \"The Addams Family\" (broadcast in the U.S in September 1964) as Miss Comstock, an official from the Addams' children's school. Blake also appeared in a memorable episode of \"I Love Lucy\" in 1957 with George Reeves guest-starring as Superman and in an earlier episode in 1954 as store clerk, Mrs. Mulford. She played the mother of Joey Barnes on the Joey Bishop show from 1961 to 1964. At one point, the producers of \"Batman\" wanted to fire Blake for unknown reasons. Adam West, with whom she had become friends, stood up for her and she kept her job. The next day, he found a freshly baked cake in his dressing room.\n\nDeclining health caused Blake's role as Aunt Harriet to be reduced, and with the introduction of Batgirl in the third and final season of \"Batman\", she appeared in only two episodes that season in a guest role. Shortly before her death, she appeared as Mrs. Hardy in the episode \"The Con Man\" of the CBS sitcom, \"The Doris Day Show\".\n\nBlake was admitted to Huntington Memorial Hospital where she passed away at age 69, the result of a heart attack. She was interred beside her mother in the family plot at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery.\n\n"}

The family later moved to Southport. Booth trained in Bolton with R. Evans, in Knightsbridge with Eileen D'Orme, and then the Guildhall School of Music, where she won a scholarship in 1925, then the Opera Scholarship and Liza Lehmann Prize. She made her professional debut at the Queen's Hall, Wigan, on 4 October 1935. She then moved back to London to continue her career in Covent Garden London in 1936, but her marriage to Dr Egon Strohm, from a brewing family in the Schwarzwald, took her to Germany.\n\nHer career blossomed with performances at Bayreuth and with the Berlin State Opera, but she also made irregular appearances at Covent Garden. She starred as Madalene in 1936, as Flosshilde in Götterdämmerung, as the Shepherd boy in recording of Tosca with Hildegard Ranczak, but was most famous for her portrayal as Carmen.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II the Nazis mistakenly trusted her, sending her to Freigegeben (Open Prison) Stalag III-D, a camp for potential recruits to the British Free Corps. There she worked with British agent and prisoner John Brown to obtain details of traitors. On one occasion she sang before Hitler just after a British officer had hidden secret documents in her dress; Hitler subsequently sent her red roses wrapped in a Swastika flag.\n\nIn early 1944, she was arrested by the Gestapo as a suspected spy, and although tortured, did not reveal any information. On release she made her way west, and was liberated in Germany by the advancing US Army.\n\nAfter the war, information she provided was used to convict both Lord Haw Haw and John Amery, both of whom were hanged for treason. She then returned to London, but was rejected as she was thought to have been a Nazi sympathizer.\n\nEmigrating again to New York, on arrival she was referred to a doctor who diagnosed her with terminal breast cancer, which claimed her life in New York on 11 April 1952, aged 46 or 47.\n"}
{"id": "43673780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43673780", "title": "Morning Patrol", "text": "Morning Patrol\n\nMorning Patrol () is a 1987 Greek drama film directed by Nikos Nikolaidis. It introduced a new iconography to Nikolaidis' work and contains several elements somewhat resembling the thriller genre and post-apocalyptic science fiction. The film has an elaborate yet simple script of strongly contrasting moods. The film's dialogue contains excerpts taken from published works authored by Daphne du Maurier, Philip K. Dick, Raymond Chandler, and Herman Raucher. It received the Best Director Award and the Greek National Ministry of Culture Award at the Thessaloniki Festival of Greek Cinema in October 1987, where Dinos Katsouridis also won the Best Cinematographer Award and Marie-Louise Bartholomew also won the Best Art Director Award. The film went on further to be officially selected for screening at Fantasporto in February 1989 where it was nominated for the International Fantasy Film Award and it was also officially selected for screening at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival in January 1987 where it was nominated for the Grand Prize.\n\nA lonely and perplexed woman, played by future Nikolaidis mainstay Michele Valley, wanders through the ruins of a destroyed and deserted city in a post-apocalyptic era. She wonders whatever happened and where did all the residents disappear to. She does not remember much about herself, including even her own name, where is she supposed to be going, and whether she ever had any relatives.\n\nHer searches throughout the city are not successful and no one can help her. Memories of the past come in the form of dreams and bestow upon her guidance and hope; all alone, in a mysterious and abandoned place, she finds the travel difficult. The windows and doors of the city's buildings are all open and the city is almost entirely silent, a silence violated only by the sounds coming out of a film theater in which the protagonist finds herself at one instance.\n\nHowever, the reigning silence is only an appearance, for at times the city comes alive and becomes a dangerous place. Carelessness and gullibility can cost lives. The woman finally meets a lonely man in despair, employed as a guard, eventually finding with him the ultimate link between love and death (a theme which Nikolaidis explored in his later films).\n\n\n"}

It is maintained by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington. The largest Catholic burial ground in the District of Columbia, it was one of the first in the city to be racially integrated.\n\nOn June 5, 1852, the Council of the City of Washington in the District of Columbia passed a local ordinance that barred the creation of new cemeteries anywhere within Georgetown or the area bounded by Boundary Street (northwest and northeast), 15th Street (east), East Capitol Street, the Anacostia River, the Potomac River, and Rock Creek. Existing Catholic cemeteries at St. Matthew's Church, St. Patrick Catholic Church, and St. Peter Catholic Church were nearly full. A number of new cemeteries were therefore established in the \"rural\" areas in and around Washington: Columbian Harmony Cemetery in D.C.; Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland; Glenwood Cemetery in D.C.; and Woodlawn Cemetery in D.C. Father Charles I. White, the 51-year-old priest who had led St. St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Church since 1857, was the individual most responsible for the creation of Mt. Olivet.\n\nThe cemetery was created in 1858. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore, which then covered the District of Columbia, purchased of Fenwick Farm for the cemetery. A gray stone lodge was built to mark the entrance. Because the burial grounds at St. Matthew's, St. Patrick, and St. Peter churches were all full by that time, a number of graves were moved to the newly-established Mount Olivet in order to make room at the old cemeteries for new burials.\n\nMount Auburn Cemetery, a rural cemetery near Boston, Massachusetts, was the model for Mount Olivet. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Mount Olivet was known as one of the \"big five\" cemeteries in Washington, D.C.\n\nFrom the start, Mount Olivet was racially integrated. Most cemeteries in the city were not. More than 7,700 African Americans were buried at Mount Olivet between 1800 and 1919 (about 7.6 percent of all African American burials in the city). In comparison, 24,000 Caucasians were buried there during the same period. Mount Olivet remains the only racially integrated cemetery from the 19th century to remain active as of 1989.\n\n\n\n"}

Ayton, Jared's best friend, arrives at the party with a bottle of rum called \"Nevis Mountain Dew.\" When people drink it, the rum seems to act as a truth serum.\n\n\"Nevis Mountain Dew\" is loosely based on the experience of a patient that the playwright encountered while working in a hospital. The play is dedicated to him.\n\n\n\n\n\"Nevis Mountain Dew\" was selected among ten New York City productions as one of \"The Best Plays of 1978–1979.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth \"Nevis Mountain Dew\" and Brian Clark's \"Whose Life Is It Anyway?\" were selected as one of the ten best plays of the 1978–1979 season in New York City. Each play tackles the subject of euthanasia through the eyes of a man that has become paralyzed. Otis L. Guernsey Jr., editor of \"The Best Plays of 1978–1979\" theatre yearbook, which recognized the two productions that season, made the following observation:\"\"Nevis Mountain Dew\" of course invites comparison with this season's British script on much the same subject, \"Whose Life Is It Anyway?\", and the NEC variation on this theme holds its own. It doesn't confront its invalid's question \"To be or not to be?\" as polemically as its British counterpart, but it takes a similar stand and a closer look at the effects of such a calamity on those surrounding the victim.\"\n\n\n"}

Aalto competed in the Finnish national selection to represent Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest two times, first in 2011 with \"Blessed with Love\" and then in 2016 with \"No Fear\", both times placing second. On 7 November 2017, it was announced that she had been internally selected by broadcaster Yle to represent Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Lisbon. The Finnish public chose the song \"Monsters\". She qualified for the grand final and finished in 25th place.\n\nShe has taken part in musicals on stage and has done a great number of dubbings for feature films and foreign television series. Saara Aalto is the voice of Princess Anna in the Finnish version of Disney's animated movie \"Frozen\". She has dueted with Adam Lambert, and had concerts together with Andrea Bocelli, José Carreras and pianist Robert Wells. She has released 5 albums on her own record label Yume Records.\n\nIn 2016, Aalto came runner-up in the thirteenth series of \"The X Factor UK\", which gained her international recognition.

Four months later, Aalto announced she had left Sony Music for Warner Music Group, citing that her previous deal did not feel like the \"right team\".\n\nBorn in Oulunsalo, Finland, Aalto grew up in a musical family and received piano lessons from pianist and pedagogue Olga Maslak, born in Odessa, Ukraine. Saara wrote her first song at the age of five. Her close relatives include painter and documentary director Eeli Aalto and magician Simo Aalto.

She has worked with several top orchestras and military bands and toured across Finland with her own band. However, becoming an international singer, and singing in English, has always been Aalto's dream, and that is why she auditioned for \"The X Factor UK\".\n\nSinging in many languages has been Aalto's passion since childhood and she has performed to many international groups visiting Finland.

I love dramatic and emotional music with a show feeling. I also want to bring love, joy and encouragement for everybody; be yourself and inspire others! I’ve studied piano since I was a little kid and through music schools, singing competitions, my career and concerts (in Finland and all over the world) I’ve gotten lots of experience and confidence to be who I am as an artist. (...) I’ve performed in musicals and big shows in Finland. (...) I’m happy to be versatile performer.\n\nSaara Aalto represented Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018. The decision was made by the Finnish national broadcaster Yle. Her song was selected among three choices in a national final; the selected song was \"Monsters\". She qualified for the final on 8th May but finished second last (25th) on 12th May.\n\nFollowing her performance of \"Blessed with Love\" for qualification in Eurovision 2011, that December she was involved in the Santa Claus Season's Greetings Song Contest, where she sang \"Ai De Zhu Fu,\" a Chinese (Mandarin) version of her Eurovision song \"Blessed with Love\". \n\nIn November 2012 Aalto was guest vocalist at Robert Wells's highly successful show \"Rhapsody in Rock\" at Shanghai Daning theatre.

On the album she performed nine of the album's 13 tracks in Mandarin language.\n\nAalto participated in season one of \"The Voice of Finland\". In the blind auditions, broadcast on 6 February 2012 on the Finnish commercial television channel Nelonen, she performed \"Taking Chances\" from Celine Dion with all four coaches, Elastinen, Lauri Tähkä, Paula Koivuniemi and Michael Monroe turning their chairs. She opted to be part of Team Monroe.\n\nIn the Battle Round on 17 February, she was confronted with team competitor Anna Inginmaa, both singing \"True Colors\". Coach Monroe opted for Aalto to go to the next round. In the live show on 23 March, she sang \"Barracuda\" and was saved by Monroe after failing to get enough votes from the public. She followed it up with the French language \"Je suis malade\" from Serge Lama and was safe after the public vote. In the semifinals with her rendition of \"Over the Rainbow\", she qualified for the finals held on 20 April where she sang \"I'm Gonna Be Strong\" from Frankie Laine and an original song titled \"My Love\". She placed second to winner Mikko Sipola.\n\nAalto auditioned for the thirteenth UK series of \"The X Factor\" in 2016, singing a cover of Sia's \"Chandelier\", which earned her three yeses from the attending judges. At the bootcamp, she performed \"On the Radio\" by Donna Summer and was sent through as part of the over-25s category with Sharon Osbourne as her mentor. At the six-chair challenge, she performed \"I See Fire\" by Ed Sheeran and was sent home by Osbourne who stated a lack of connection. However, after the crowd chanted to bring her back, Aalto was given a chance to perform Serge Lama's \"Je suis malade\", which caused the crowd to turn on her, while Nicole Scherzinger criticized her song choice, stating \"we ain't in France\". Osbourne then asked Aalto to leave. \n\nAalto was brought back as Scherzinger's wildcard pick for the over-25s category and therefore went to judges' houses. She was chosen to proceed to the live shows after performing ABBA's \"The Winner Takes It All\". In week 1 of the live shows, Aalto finished in the bottom three after performing \"Let It Go\" and faced a sing-off against the duo Bratavio, where she performed \"Alive\" by Sia. Aalto was saved with only Louis Walsh voting to eliminate her, though praising her performance. The following week, she sang \"River Deep – Mountain High\" and finished again in the bottom three, performing \"Run\" by Snow Patrol in a sing-off against Freddy Parker. The result went to deadlock and Aalto was saved as she had the greater public vote. In week 3 she performed \"It's Oh So Quiet\" coming 2nd in the public vote, and in week 4 Aalto sang \"Bad Romance\", placing 3rd in the public vote. In week 5, Aalto finished in the bottom three for the third time after her rendition of \"Sound of the Underground\", but was saved by majority vote after performing \"Who You Are\" in a sing-off against the group Four of Diamonds.

In the ensuing public vote, she placed as the runner-up to eventual winner Matt Terry with 40.4% of the votes.\n\nIn her press-conference on 20 December 2016, Aalto revealed that she works with the joint effort of ROAR Global and Global career management companies, and that she has signed a five-album recording deal with Sony Music UK and Sony Music Finland. In October 2017, Aalto announced she had left Sony Music for Warner Music Group. In a statement, she said: \"I was honoured I was signed to Sony. But later I felt like they weren't the right team. When I met the people at Warner they were very excited about my style and making me into this big theatrical artist.\" On 7 November 2017, it was announced that Aalto would represent Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal. The three bidding entries will be released by Yle and Saara Aalto, along with an accompanying music video, on 9, 16 and 23 February 2018, respectively. Aalto was a judge on the second series of the Finnish version of \"The X Factor\", mentoring the girls. Aalto could not attend the finale night of \"The X Factor Finland\" due to her commitments with The Eurovision, so Matt Terry represented her instead, but her category's last girl, Tika Liljegren, was crowned the winner, making Aalto the winning mentor. Aalto announced in March 2018 via social media that her first album under Warner Music Group, \"Wild Wild Wonderland\", would be released on 27 April 2018.\n\nAalto had a nine-year relationship with singer , but the couple broke up in 2013. Aalto and Roivainen continued collaborating in music. Aalto later began a relationship with a female fan, personal trainer and life coach, Meri Sopanen. They became engaged on their two-year anniversary in August 2016. Aalto now identifies as a lesbian.\n\nAalto and Sopanen moved to London in January 2017. The idea to audition for \"The X Factor\" came from Sopanen.\n\n"}

He is famous for his children's books, particularly \"The Little Black Fish\". Influenced by predominantly leftist ideologies that were common among the Iranian intelligentsia of his era, his books typically portrayed the lives of the children of the urban poor and encouraged the individual to change his/ her circumstances by her own initiatives.\n\nHe was born in Tabriz to a lower-class Iranian Azerbaijani family. Son to Ezzat and Sara, he had two other brothers and three sisters. His father was seasonal worker and his income was never sufficient, who eventually left Iran for the Caucasus and never returned. He finished elementary school and three years of secondary school before enrolling in a teacher training school, finishing the program in 1957. Thus, only receiving few years of education, at the age of 18, he became a teacher, and continued to be so for the rest of his life, in East Azerbaijan. In the next eleven years, while teaching Persian in rural schools of Iranian Azerbaijan, he attained a B.A. degree in English from Tabriz University. \nHe Started publishing stories in 1960, his first being \"Adat\" \"Custom\". He carried on writing stories, along translating from English and Turkish to Persian, and Persian to Turkish.\nLater, claiming that he was impolite, he was dismissed from his high school teaching post and assigned to an elementary school. Then, as his cultural works increased, he was accused and pursued, and suspended of teaching. After a while his sentence was called off and he returned to schools.\nLater, he attended student protests.\n\nHowever, he was not allowed to publish his works in Azeri, so he had to translate them into Persian in order to make them available in Iran.\n\nApart from children's stories, he wrote many pedagogical essays and collected and published several samples of oral Azerbaijani literature. His folklore studies have usually been done with the help of his colleague Behrooz Dehghani, who helped publish some of Behrangi's works after his early death. Behrangi also has a few Azeri translations from Persian poems by Ahmad Shamlou, Forough Farrokhzad, and Mehdi Akhavan-Sales.\n\nApart from Children's Stories, he wrote many pedagogical essays and collected and published several samples of oral Azerbaijani literature.

Behrangi also has a few Azeri language translations of Persian poems by Ahmad Shamlou, Forough Farrokhzad, and Mehdi Akhavan-Sales.\n\nBehrangi drowned in the Aras river and his death was blamed on the Pahlavi regime. It is believed that an army officer, Hamzeh Farahati, was seen with him when he drowned. Yet the army officer was Samad Behrangi's close friend and shared his Leftist views. Farahati in his book and in an interview with VOA has unequivocally confirmed that Samad drowned and was not killed by SAVAK. Cultural society, people like Al-e Ahmad and Saedi, found it hard to accept his death. But some, in particular Behrouz Dowlat-abadi, also said that Samad did not know how to swim (which was confirmed by a native, Hosein Hosein-zadeh) and that was the cause of his death. This, in turn, brought up the point that everyone was just quoting Behrouz Dowlat-abadi and that no investigation was done.\n\n\n\"so easily can death call on me but I have to keep up living as long as I can. However, if I face the death some day_ that I will_ doesn't matter. What matters is the effect of my life and death on others'.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The author is unknown, and the Seth referenced in the title appears nowhere in the text. Instead Seth is thought to reference the third son of Adam and Eve to whom gnosis was first revealed, according to some gnostics. The author appears to belong to a group of gnostics who maintain that Jesus Christ was not crucified on the cross. Instead the text says that Simon of Cyrene was mistaken for Jesus and crucified in his place. Jesus is described as standing by and \"laughing at their ignorance.\"\n\nThose who believe Jesus to have died on the cross are said to believe in \"a doctrine of a dead man.\" All those without gnosis - including those who had what would become orthodox beliefs, as well as the figures of Adam, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Solomon, the prophets, and Moses - are all referred to as a \"laughingstock.\" The text shows the derision which the gnostics felt towards those who did not realize their claimed truth; that the biblical text was false (in at least certain important respects) and that the God of the Jews was not the true God. \n\nThe Treatise of the Great Seth is written from the first-person perspective of Jesus.\n\nSome Gnostics believed Jesus was not a man but a docetistic spirit, and therefore could not die. From the translation by Roger A. Bullard and Joseph A. Gibbons:\n\nAt the beginning of the book, Jesus states:\n\nThis statement indicates that Jesus inhabited a human body that had previously belonged to someone else, which meant the body was not his own.\n\nHe also explains that the being that created the world is not the One True God. Jesus instead proclaims:\n\nThis demonstrates the gnostic view that the God of the Hebrew Bible was not the One True God, but rather an inferior being called the Demiurge, which was created by Sophia.\n\nJesus also makes statements claiming that Adam, Moses, and John the Baptist were all also \"laughingstocks\". He says:\n\nHe says these prominent figures were \"laughingstocks\" because they believed that the Demiurge was the One True God, and did not know the Gnostic truth.\n\n"}

{"id": "7617805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7617805", "title": "Starvation response", "text": "Starvation response\n\nStarvation response in animals is a set of adaptive biochemical and physiological changes that reduce metabolism in response to a lack of food.\n\nEquivalent or closely related terms include famine response, starvation mode, famine mode, starvation resistance, starvation tolerance, adapted starvation, adaptive thermogenesis, fat adaptation, and metabolic adaptation.\n\nStarvation contributes to tolerance during infection, as nutrients become limited when they are sequestered by host defenses and consumed by proliferating bacteria. One of the most important causes of starvation induced tolerance in vivo is biofilm growth, which occurs in many chronic infections. Starvation in biofilms is due to nutrient consumption by cells located on the periphery of biofilm clusters and by reduced diffusion of substrates through the biofilm. Biofilm bacteria shows extreme tolerance to almost all antibiotic classes, and supplying limiting substrates can restore sensitivity.\n\n\"Starvation mode\" is a state in which the body responds to prolonged periods of low energy intake. During short periods of energy abstinence, the human body burns primarily free fatty acids from body fat stores, along with small amounts of muscle tissue to provide required glucose for the brain. After prolonged periods of starvation the body has depleted its body fat and begins to burn primarily lean tissue and muscle as a fuel source.\n\nOrdinarily, the body responds to reduced energy intake by burning fat reserves and consuming muscle and other tissues. Specifically, the body burns fat after first exhausting the contents of the digestive tract along with glycogen reserves stored in liver cells. After prolonged periods of starvation, the body uses the proteins within muscle tissue as a fuel source.\n\nThe magnitude and composition of the starvation response (i.e. metabolic adaptation) was estimated in a study of 8 individuals living in isolation in Biosphere 2 for two years. During their isolation, they gradually lost an average of 15% (range: 9–24%) of their body weight due to harsh conditions. On emerging from isolation, the eight isolated individuals were compared with a 152-person control group that initially had had similar physical characteristics. On average, the starvation response of the individuals after isolation was a 180 kCal reduction in daily total energy expenditure. 60 kCal of the starvation response was explained by a reduction in fat-free mass and fat mass. An additional 65 kCal was explained by a reduction in fidgeting. The remaining 55 kCal was statistically insignificant.\n\nThe energetic requirements of a body are composed of the basal metabolic rate and the physical activity level. This caloric requirement can be met with protein, fat, carbohydrates, alcohol, or a mixture of those. Glucose is the general metabolic fuel, and can be metabolized by any cell. Fructose and some other nutrients can only be metabolized in the liver, where their metabolites transform into either glucose stored as glycogen in the liver and in muscles, or into fatty acids stored in adipose tissue.\n\nBecause of the blood–brain barrier, getting nutrients to the human brain is especially dependent on molecules that can pass this barrier. The brain itself consumes about 18% of the basal metabolic rate: on a total intake of 1800 kcal/day, this equates to 324 kcal, or about 80 g of glucose. About 25% of total body glucose consumption occurs in the brain.\n\nGlucose can be obtained directly from dietary sugars and by the breakdown of other carbohydrates. In the absence of dietary sugars and carbohydrates, glucose is obtained from the breakdown of stored glycogen. Glycogen is a readily-accessible storage form of glucose, stored in notable quantities in the liver and in small quantities in the muscles.\n\nWhen the glycogen reserve is depleted, glucose can be obtained from the breakdown of fats from adipose tissue. Fats are broken down into glycerol and free fatty acids, with the glycerol being turned into glucose in the liver via the gluconeogenesis pathway.\n\nWhen even the glucose made from glycerol reserves start declining, the liver starts producing ketone bodies. Ketone bodies are short-chain derivatives of the free fatty acids mentioned in the previous paragraph, and can cross the blood–brain barrier, meaning they can be used by the brain as an alternative metabolic fuel. Fatty acids can be used directly as an energy source by most tissues in the body.\n\nAfter the exhaustion of the glycogen reserve, and for the next 2–3 days, fatty acids are the principal metabolic fuel. At first, the brain continues to use glucose, because, if a non-brain tissue is using fatty acids as its metabolic fuel, the use of glucose in the same tissue is switched off. Thus, when fatty acids are being broken down for energy, all of the remaining glucose is made available for use by the brain.\n\nAfter 2 or 3 days of fasting, the liver begins to synthesize ketone bodies from precursors obtained from fatty acid breakdown. The brain uses these ketone bodies as fuel, thus cutting its requirement for glucose. After fasting for 3 days, the brain gets 30% of its energy from ketone bodies. After 4 days, this goes up to 75%.\n\nThus, the production of ketone bodies cuts the brain's glucose requirement from 80 g per day to about 30 g per day. Of the remaining 30 g requirement, 20 g per day can be produced by the liver from glycerol (itself a product of fat breakdown). This still leaves a deficit of about 10 g of glucose per day that must come from some other source. This other source is the body's own proteins.\n\nAfter several days of fasting, all cells in the body begin to break down protein. This releases amino acids into the bloodstream, which can be converted into glucose by the liver. Since much of our muscle mass is protein, this phenomenon is responsible for the wasting away of muscle mass seen in starvation.\n\nHowever, the body can selectively decide which cells break down protein and which do not. About 2–3 g of protein must be broken down to synthesize 1 g of glucose; about 20–30 g of protein is broken down each day to make 10 g of glucose to keep the brain alive. However, to conserve protein, this number may decrease the longer the fasting.\n\nStarvation ensues when the fat reserves are completely exhausted and protein is the only fuel source available to the body. Thus, after periods of starvation, the loss of body protein affects the function of important organs, and death results, even if there are still fat reserves left unused. (In a leaner person, the fat reserves are depleted earlier, the protein depletion occurs sooner, and therefore death occurs sooner.)\n\nThe ultimate cause of death is, in general, cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest brought on by tissue degradation and electrolyte imbalances.\n\nIn very obese persons, it has been shown that proteins can be depleted first and death from starvation is predicted to occur before fat reserves are used up. (There is nothing in the study about any of the five subjects dying.)\n\nDuring starvation, less than half the energy used by the brain comes from metabolized glucose. Because the human brain can use ketone bodies as major fuel sources, the body is not forced to break down skeletal muscles at a high rate, thereby maintaining both cognitive function and mobility for up to several weeks. This response is extremely important in human evolution and allowed for humans to continue to find food effectively even in the face of prolonged starvation.\n\nInitially, the level of insulin in circulation drops and the levels of glucagon, epinephrine and norepinephrine rise. At this time, there is an up-regulation of glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and ketogenesis. The body’s glycogen stores are consumed in about 24 hours. In a normal 70 kg adult, only about 8,000 kilojoules of glycogen are stored in the body (mostly in the striated muscles).The body also engages in gluconeogenesis to convert glycerol and glucogenic amino acids into glucose for metabolism. Another adaptation is the Cori cycle, which involves shuttling lipid-derived energy in glucose to peripheral glycolytic tissues, which in turn send the lactate back to the liver for resynthesis to glucose. Because of these processes, blood glucose levels remain relatively stable during prolonged starvation.\n\nHowever, the main source of energy during prolonged starvation is derived from triglycerides. Compared to the 8,000 kilojoules of stored glycogen, lipid fuels are much richer in energy content, and a 70 kg adult stores over 400,000 kilojoules of triglycerides (mostly in adipose tissue). Triglycerides are broken down to fatty acids via lipolysis. Epinephrine precipitates lipolysis by activating protein kinase A, which phosphorylates hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin. These enzymes, along with CGI-58 and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), complex at the surface of lipid droplets. The concerted action of ATGL and HSL liberates the first two fatty acids. Cellular monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), liberates the final fatty acid. The remaining glycerol enters gluconeogenesis.\n\nFatty acids by themselves cannot be used as a direct fuel source. They must first undergo beta oxidation in the mitochondria (mostly of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and liver cells). Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria as an acyl-carnitine via the action of the enzyme CAT-1. This step controls the metabolic flux of beta oxidation. The resulting acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle and undergoes oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. The body invests some of this ATP in gluconeogenesis to produce more glucose.\n\nTriglycerides and long-chain fatty acids are too hydrophobic to cross into brain cells, so the liver must convert them into short-chain fatty acids and ketone bodies through ketogenesis. The resulting ketone bodies, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, are amphipathic and can be transported into the brain (and muscles) and broken down into acetyl-CoA for use in the TCA cycle. Acetoacetate breaks down spontaneously into acetone, and the acetone is released through the urine and lungs to produce the “acetone breath” that accompanies prolonged fasting. The brain also uses glucose during starvation, but most of the body’s glucose is allocated to the skeletal muscles and red blood cells. The cost of the brain using too much glucose is muscle loss. If the brain and muscles relied entirely on glucose, the body would lose 50% of its nitrogen content in 8–10 days.\n\nAfter prolonged fasting, the body begins to degrade its own skeletal muscle. To keep the brain functioning, gluconeogenesis continues to generate glucose, but glucogenic amino acids—primarily alanine—are required. These come from the skeletal muscle. Late in starvation, when blood ketone levels reach 5-7 mM, ketone use in the brain rises, while ketone use in muscles drops.\n\nAutophagy then occurs at an accelerated rate. In autophagy, cells cannibalize critical molecules to produce amino acids for gluconeogenesis. This process distorts the structure of the cells, and a common cause of death in starvation is due to diaphragm failure from prolonged autophagy.\n\n\n\n"}

He lived in Roanoke, Alabama. At age 69, he died of smoke inhalation when his house burned down during the early morning hours of Friday, July 29, 1989.\n\nClark is the subject of a self-published biography, written by his only offspring, Charlotte A. Clark-Frieson, entitled \"Chief Cook & Bottle-Washer: The Unconquerable Soul of Wilkie Clark.\"\n\nIn this biography, Clark-Frieson posthumously claims for her father the historical remembrance and distinction that she believes he rightfully deserves as an Alabama Champion for Civil and Human Rights. Thus, she writes him into history, through her book. As a result of the publication of the biography, on February 19, 2005, Clark posthumously received historical distinction by resolution of the Randolph County Commission, The Roanoke City Council, and the Mayor of the City of Five Points, Alabama.\n\nClark's biography tells the story of a dirt-poor boy who grew up under the oppressive conditions of Jim Crow in the South, and emerged from raw racial oppression to become a self-made, and self-taught entrepreneur. As a young man, he accepted the position of President of the County's NAACP, a challenge very few black men of that day were willing to accept, for with it came the threat of being lynched, or ambushed by vindictive whites, who at that time, felt free to do to black civil rights workers, whatever they pleased. As NAACP president, and with limited help from other blacks Clark pressed forward, implementing every NAACP initiative he could—challenging the racial conditions of unpaved streets, inadequate school facilities, and books, desegregation, voter registration, and after desegregation, served as a staunch advocate for the children attending schools in Randolph County, Alabama. During the 1970s he became the first black to run for a seat on the County's Board of Education, with whom he had battled for a number of years over unfair discipline at the Randolph County High School. Aided by many other black activists who later came on the scene, Clark was instrumental in facilitating the filing of litigation creating single member voting districts, making it possible for many \"firsts\" to be elected to public offices in Randolph County, Alabama. His own daughter, Charlotte A. Clark-Frieson was among those elected to public office, as a result of this litigation.\n\nAs a means of strengthening her claim of historical distinction, Clark-Frieson has founded and established a Randolph County-based grass-roots organization named for Clark, called The Wilkie Clark Memorial Foundation, Inc. She uses her father's life and courageous community works as the philosophical pillars upon which the foundation's missions are established. Its purposes include: black economic empowerment, historical preservation of black history throughout East Alabama and West Georgia, community education, etc.\n\nAs a means of promoting the missions of the Clark Memorial Foundation, Inc., the organization publishes a black weekly newspaper, \"The Peoples Voice\". The Peoples Voice was inaugurated July 22, 2005, and has been in continuous publication since. The paper is distributed throughout the nation, with it major new focus on East Alabama and West Georgia.\n\n\n"}
