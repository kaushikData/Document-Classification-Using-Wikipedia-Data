The uprising caused approximately forty deaths and ended after Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa became the Emir of Bahrain in 1999 and a referendum on 14–15 February 2001 massively supported the National Action Charter. The uprising resulted in the deaths of around 40 civilians and at least one Bahraini soldier.\n\nIn 1971, Bahrain became independent from Britain and in 1973 the country had its first parliamentary election. However, two years later the constitution was suspended and the assembly dissolved by the Amir, Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa after it rejected the State Security Law. The act also known as \"the precautionary law\" was proposed by Ian Henderson. It gave police wide arresting powers and allowed individuals to be held in prison without trial or charge for up to three years for mere suspicion \"that they might be a threat to the state\". Starting in August 1975, widespread arrests were conducted including members of the dissolved parliament. The \"ruthless system of repression\" launched by Henderson lasted for over twenty five years. Repeated allegations of systematic torture, arbitrary arrests of thousands and assassinations made by opposition activists and human rights groups were denied by Henderson who said he \"has never been involved in torture nor has he ever ordered his officers to torture those who have been arrested\".\n\nIn 1992, a petition signed by 280 society leaders, including some of the dissolved parliament members called for the restoration of the national assembly. Initially, the government set up a thirty-member appointed \"Shura council\" assigned with \"commenting\" on government proposed legislation. Another petition the following month concluded that the newly formed council \"does not replace the national assembly as a constitutional and legislative authority\". A delegation of six members, half Sunnis and half Shias representing petition organizers met with the Amir who told them Shura council \"was all [they] could expect\".\n\nLike other uprisings during the 1990s, the uprising's stated aims were for democratic reform, and it was considered as the first movement in the Arab world where leftists, liberals and Islamists joined forces on a common ground calling for restoration of the dissolved parliament and suspended constitution.\n\nAlthough attempts were made to portray a totalitarian nature of an Islamic fundamentalist ideology, the events and the moderate discourse of their leaders attracted support from all human rights organizations (such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Article 19, UN Human Rights Sub-Commission, etc.) as well as from members of parliament in the UK, France, USA and the EU. The final aim of the uprising was the reinstatement of the 1973 constitution and respect of human rights in Bahrain, while preserving plurality of opinions in society.\n\nThe uprising began in June 1994, with a picket by unemployed people in front of the ministry of labour. Over 1,500 demonstrator tried to organize a sit-in front of Ministry of Labor protesting the increasing rate of unemployment which had reached 15 percent. Riot police dispersed them using tear gas. Similar incidents occurred in August and September. Another petition was launched, this time it was open to all citizens. Organizers said they collected over 20,000 signatures most of whom were Shia.\n\nIn November, hundreds of Shia protested against a charity marathon. The route of the marathon was through some Shia villages, who considered the female dressings offensive. Reportedly, some protesters threw stones on the marathon, which prompted security forces to conduct a number of arrests. The following month Ali Salman, a protest leader, was arrested after being accused of inciting the incident. The arrest sparked further protests and violence in Manama and Sitra. Some protesters used Molotov cocktails to attack \"police stations, banks and commercial properties\". On the other hand, riot police used tear and rubber bullets, sometimes \"fired at street level and from helicopters\". It was also reported that police used live ammunition on some occasions.\n\nBy December, the number of detainees was between 500 and 600 according to the US Embassy. A number of opposition leaders, including Ali Salman were exiled in January 1995. Protests and arrests continued amid some government statements of releasing prisoners. In February the government said only 300 remain in prison, while activists said the number was as high as 2000. The level of violence and arrests increased again in March and April. Abdul Amir al-Jamri, the leader of the uprising was arrested on 1 April along with other protest leaders such as Abdulwahab Hussain and Hassan Mushaima.\n\nOne month after their arrest, the government started jailhouse negotiations with opposition leaders. About twenty one-or-two-hour meetings were conducted in four months between activists one side and Henderson, his deputy; Adel Flaifel or Minister of Interior on the other side. An agreement named \"the Initiative\" was reached in which opposition leaders would calm people in exchange for releasing all of those not convicted in courts. The government reportedly agreed that at a later stage after establishment of security, it would start a political dialogue with opposition. Initially, protests paused, however they resumed after the government denied such an agreement existed.\n\nIn December 1995 and January 1996, two bombs exploded in a shopping mall and a hotel without causing any casualties. Opposition leaders were arrested. No charges were filed against them (as of May 2007). Bombings continued in the following months collecting the lives of eight people. The number of deaths by this time reached twenty four, including several deaths while in police custody due to alleged torture as well as three security forces. In May, a protester was sentenced to death penalty for allegedly killing a policeman. During this period, arrests increased, especially among women and children.\n\nIn June, the government said it had detected a network called the \"military wing of Hizb AllahBahrain\". The government alleged it was backed by Iran and had caused the unrest. The claim that \"Hizb Allah\" existed in Bahrain was described by Human Rights Watch as lacking any credibility, however the report noted the influence of Iran during that period.\n\nThe uprising was characterized by extreme forms of suppression, riots, stoning and bomb attacks. Over forty people were killed, mostly by the security forces. Most of the events of the uprising took place in Shia villages and towns; there was a strong religious component in the violence. The rhetoric of the pro-government quarters attempted to stain the image of the uprising, but at the end, the situation had to improve following the longest ever uprising in the history of Bahrain.\n\nThe violence generally subsided after King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa carried out political reforms after he ascended to the throne in 1999. On 14 and 15 February 2001, the National Action Charter was overwhelmingly approved by Bahrainis, with 98.4% in favour.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17991095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17991095", "title": "1 Corinthians 15", "text": "1 Corinthians 15\n\n1 Corinthians 15 is the fifteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians by Paul the Apostle. The first eleven verses contain the earliest account of the resurrection appearances of Jesus in the New Testament. The rest of the chapter stresses the primacy of the resurrection for Christianity. Readings from the text are given at funerals in the Catholic Church – where mourners are assured of the \"sure and certain expectation of the resurrection to a better life\".\n\n\nThe New King James Version organises this chapter as follows:\n\nThe chapter begins with the statement of the Good News, received by Paul from the ascended Jesus Christ. Paul reveals the significance of the death, burial, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ and that if we believe this message that we are saved. The account of the Resurrection appearances of Jesus in verses 3–7 appears to be an early pre-Pauline creedal statement.\n\nThe antiquity of the creed has been located by most biblical scholars to no more than five years after Jesus' death, probably originating from the Jerusalem apostolic community. Based on linguistic analysis, the version received by Paul seems to have included verses 3b–6a and 7. The creed has been deemed to be historically reliable and is claimed to preserve a unique and verifiable testimony of the time.\n\nIn dissent from the majority view, Robert M. Price and Hermann Detering, writing in the Journal of Higher Criticism (edited by Price) argued that 1 Corinthians 15:3–7 was not an early Christian creed written within five years of Jesus' death. Price and Detering denied that Paul wrote the verses and believed they were an Interpolation possibly dating to as far back as the beginning of the 2nd century. Price said that \"The pair of words in verse 3a, \"received / delivered\" (\"paralambanein\" / \"paradidonai\") is, as has often been pointed out, technical language for the handing on of rabbinical tradition\". According to Price, this (supposedly interpolated) text contradicts Paul's tale of conversion described in Galatians 1:13–24 which explicitly denies that Paul had been taught the gospel of Christ by any man, but rather by Jesus himself. However, many commentators have the view that Paul \"received\" this from Jesus. They point to 1 Cor. 11:23 as evidence of this idea. \"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread...\" (1 Corinthians 11:23, (KJV) ) The Greek words for \"received / delivered\" are the same here as in 1 Corinthians 15:3.\n\nAgainst these scholars, Geza Vermes defends the majority view in \"The Resurrection\". Vermes says that the words of Paul are \"a tradition he has inherited from his seniors in the faith concerning the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus\". Gary R. Habermas argues, \"Essentially all critical scholars today agree that in Corinthians 15:3–8, Paul records an ancient oral tradition(s) that summarizes the content of the Christian gospel,\" in which Paul \"uses the explicit language of oral transmission,\" according to Donald Hagner. In other words, Paul's account has been described by scholars as \"the very early tradition that was common to all Christians\", as \"a sacred tradition\", and contained in \"the oldest strata of tradition\".\n\nAccording to Paul's Epistle to the Galatians he had previously met two of the people mentioned in these verses as witnesses of the resurrection: James the Just and Cephas/Peter:\nThen after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days. I saw none of the other apostles – only James, the Lord's brother. I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie. ()\n\nMoreover, even skeptical scholars agree that the creed in 1 Corinthians 15 is not an interpolation but was a creed formulated and taught at a very early date after Jesus' death. Gerd Lüdemann, a skeptic scholar, maintains that \"the elements in the tradition are to be dated to the first two years after the crucifixion of Jesus... not later than three years...\" Michael Goulder, another skeptic scholar, states that it \"goes back at least to what Paul was taught when he was converted, a couple of years after the crucifixion\".\n\nThis was probably James, brother of Jesus.\n\nIn verses 12–19, St Paul, in response to some expressed doubts of the Corinthian congregation, whom he is addressing in the letter, adduces the fundamental importance of the resurrection as a Christian doctrine. Through those verses, Paul is stressing the importance of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and its relevance to the core of Christianity. Paul rebukes the Corinth Church by saying if Jesus did not resurrect after the crucifixion, then there is no point in the Christianity faith (1 Cor 15:12–19 ESV).\n\nIn verses 20–28, Paul states that Christ will return in power and put his \"enemies under his feet\" (25) and even death, \"the last enemy\", shall be destroyed:\n\nIn verse 29 Paul notes that at Corinth there existed a practice whereby a living person would be baptized instead of some convert who had recently died. Mormons interpret this passage to support their practice of Baptism for the dead. This principle of vicarious work for the dead is an important work of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the dispensation of the fulness of times. This interpretation is rejected by all other denominations of Christianity. \nTeignmouth Shore, writing in Ellicott's \"Commentary for Modern Readers\", notes that \"there have been numerous and ingenious conjectures as to the meaning of this passage. The only tenable interpretation is that there existed amongst some of the Christians at Corinth a practice of baptising a living person in the stead of some convert who had died before that sacrament had been administered to him. Such a practice existed amongst the Marcionites in the second century, and still earlier amongst a sect called the Corinthians.\" The Jerusalem Bible states that \"What this practice was is unknown. Paul does not say if he of approved it or not: he uses it merely for an \"ad hominem\" argument\".\n\nVerse 33 has a quotation from classical Greek literature. According to the church historian Socrates of Constantinople it is from a Greek tragedy of Euripides, but modern scholarship, following Jerome attributes it to the comedy \"Thaĩs\" by Menander, or Menander quoting Euripides. It might not have been a direct quote by Paul: \"This saying was widely known as a familiar quotation.\"\n\nThe chapter concludes with an account of the nature of the resurrection. At the Last Judgement the dead will be raised and both the living and the dead transformed into \"spiritual bodies\" (44):\n\nThrough the power of Christ \"Death is swallowed up in victory\" (54). Referencing a verse in Hosea, Paul asks: \"O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory?\" (55), equating sin with death and the Judaic Law which have now been conquered and superseded by the victory of Christ.\n\nVerses 3–5 (plus possible additional verses) may be one of the earliest creeds about Jesus' death and resurrection. The antiquity of the creed has been noted by most biblical scholars, probably originating from the Jerusalem apostolic community.\n\n\n"}

Abraham was a disciple of Cornelius of Paleostrov and one of his successors as abbot of his monastery.\n\nFrom the \"Legend of the Life of the Reverend Cornelius of Paleostrov\", it is known that Abraham came to Cornelius after he had settled in a cave on the island of Paley on Lake Onega. The Paleostrovsky Monastery was founded by Cornelius, presumably no later than 1415-1421. Abraham together with other disciples of Cornelius participated in the construction of the churches of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, of Elijah the Prophet and Nikolaos the Wonderworker, the caves for the monks. In the lifetime of Cornelius he appointed Abraham as his successor. The Venerable Cornelius died about 1420, Abraham buried him in the cave of the island of Paley. The Reverend Cornelius died about 1420, Abraham buried him in the cave of the island of Paley. Later, the relics of Cornelius Paleostrovsky were transferred to the Church of Nativity of the Blessed Virgin. The Monk Abraham died in the middle of the 15th century. He was buried in the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin near Cornelius.\n\nThe date of the local canonization of Abraham Paleostrovsky is unknown. In the XVII century, the Palaeostrovsky Monastery was twice devastated, as a result of which most of the archive was lost. The local veneration of Abraham and Cornelius was documented at the beginning of the 19th century. Archbishop Sergius (Spassky) assigned the feast day of both saints - August 21.

{"id": "23834216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23834216", "title": "Agni Yoga", "text": "Agni Yoga\n\nAgni Yoga (Russian: \"Агни Йога\") or the Living Ethics (Russian: \"Жива́я Этика\"), or the Teaching of Life (Russian: \"Учение Жизни\") is a one of the neo-theosophical religious doctrine transmitted by the Helena Roerich and Nicholas Roerich from 1920. The term \"Agni Yoga\" means “Mergence with Divine Fire” or “Path to Mergence with Divine Fire”. This term was introduced by the Roerichs. The followers of Agni Yoga believe that the teaching was given to the Roerich family and their associates by Master Morya, the guru of Roerichs and Helena Blavatsky, one of the founders of the modern theosophical movement and the Theosophical Society. \n\nAgni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. According to Helena Roerich, Agni Yoga is the synthesis of all yogas. In all the ancient Hindu scriptures, the approaching Fiery Age was predicted. Agni-Fire, which to a varying degree is at the heart of all the yogas, will extremely sate the atmosphere of our planet, and all the branches of Yoga will be merged into a fiery synthesis. Agni Yoga is a fire baptism.\n\nThe most significant features of Agni Yoga are cosmism and universalism. They are expressed in the interpretation of any phenomena of human existence from the point of view of their cosmic significance and interrelation with the being of the Universe.\n\nAgni Yoga played a significant role in bringing knowledge of Asian religions to Western world. Living Ethics has an international following and has thousands of adherents. The ideas of Teaching of Life have exerted an influence on another esoteric movements and philosophies, among them the New Age and Transhumanism.\n\nThe term \"Agni Yoga\" means “Mergence with Divine Fire” or “Path to Mergence with Divine Fire”. This term was introduced to the western public by the Nicholas Roerich and Helena Roerich.\n\n\"Agni\" () is the Vedic and Living Ethics \"God of Fire\", one marks immortality and the symbol of life. Agni is one of the supreme gods in the Rigveda. In Agni Yoga it is the Creative Fire of the Universe, the root of the \"Fire of Space\"; and \"psychic energy\", the powers of the human mind and heart, particularly those manifesting in love, thought, and creativity. The origin myth found in many Indo-European cultures Agni is a bird like being, that brings fire from the gods to mankind. Alternatively, this messenger brings an elixir of immortality from heaven to Earth. In the early Vedic literature, Agni primarily connotes the fire as a god, one reflecting the primordial powers to consume, transform and convey.\n\n\"Yoga\" (; ) is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Yoga is a group of spiritual, mental, and physical practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. The term \"Yoga\" has been applied to a variety of practices and methods. In Hinduism these include Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga, Laya Yoga and Hatha Yoga. The term \"Rāja yoga\" originally referred to the ultimate goal of yoga, which is Samadhi (Sanskrit: , ), but was popularised by Swami Vivekananda as the common name for \"Ashtanga Yoga\". In the Ashtanga Yoga tradition, \"Samadhi\" is the eighth and final limb identified in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.\n\n\"Aum\" or \"Oṃ\" (Devanagari: ), , is a sacred sound and a spiritual symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. This word has three phonemes: \"a\", \"u\", and \"m\", though it is often described as trisyllabic despite this being either archaic or the result of translation. That signifies the essence of the ultimate reality, consciousness or Atman. The twelfth book of the Scriptures of Agni Yoga is called \"AUM\". Aum, as this book says, was a synthesis of sonant strivings. Prayer and inward concentration are excellent attainments which render healthful the state of the spirit. Each one in his own way has contributed a manifestation useful to spiritual concentration, whether he sought the solution in music, in song, or in the dance; man was striving to create a particularly exalted state of mind, promoting the reception of the higher energies.\n\n\"Ur\" or \"Aditi\" (Sanskrit: अदिति \"limitless\"), in the Vedas and Living Ethics is the Mother of the gods and all twelve zodiacal spirits from whose cosmic matrix the heavenly bodies were born. As celestial mother of every existing form and being, the synthesis of all things, she is associated with space and with mystic speech. She is mentioned nearly 80 times in the Rigveda: the verse \"Daksha sprang from Aditi and Aditi from Daksha\" is seen by Theosophists as a reference to \"the eternal cyclic re-birth of the same divine Essence\" and divine wisdom. \"Ur is the root of the Light of Fire\", it is stated in the holy writ of Agni Yoga.\n\n\"Shambhala\" (, ;) is a birthplace of Kalki, the final incarnation of Vishnu, who will usher in a New Age — Satya Yuga. Shambhala is ruled over by Maitreya. The Kalacakra Tantra prophesies that when all is lost, Kalki will emerge from Shambhala to vanquish \"Dark Forces\" and usher in a worldwide Golden Age. Shambhala is also called Shangri-la.\n\n\"Morya\" is one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom within modern Theosophical beliefs. He is one of the Mahatmas who inspired the founding of the Theosophy and Agni Yoga. He has written and dictated the letters with the goal of elevating mankind and bringing in a New Age. The Master Morya will physically incarnate in order to be the Manu (\"progenitor\") of the new root race.\n\n\"Tara Urusvati\" (\"The Light of the Morning Star\") is the spiritual name of Helena Roerich (1879 – 1955) in Agni Yoga and Rerikhism. She was a teacher and healer as well as the inspired co-author of the \"Agni Yoga series\", the first English books about Living Ethics and the Roerichs' relationship with their Guru. Each of the 935 paragraphs of the book \"Supermundane\" begins with the word \"Urusvati\". In the epilogue of the book \"Agni Yoga\" she was called the Mother of Agni Yoga.\n\n\"Fuyama\" is the spiritual name of Nicholas Roerich (1874 – 1947) in Agni Yoga and Rerikhism. He was an internationally acclaimed artist, conservationist, archeologist, humanitarian and peacemaker. Nicolas Roerich called Urusvati “She Who Leads” in his creations.\n\n\"Karma\" (; , ) means action, work or deed. It also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual influence his future. Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and future suffering. With origins in ancient India's Vedic civilization, the philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth in many schools of Indian religions, particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. Karma works as one of the great principles of Cosmic Action. \"When man realizes the power of karma and strives to express the best aspirations, his path is parallel with the universal energy. The universal energy attracts the creative strivings. The future and the Infinite are thus being built\", written in the Holy Scripture of Agni Yoga.\n\n\"Spiritual evolution\" is the philosophical, theological, esoteric or spiritual idea that nature and human beings and human culture evolve: either extending from an established cosmological pattern (ascent), or in accordance with certain pre-established potentials. The phrase \"spiritual evolution\" can occur in the context of \"higher evolution\", a term used to differentiate psychological, mental, or spiritual evolution from the \"lower evolution\" or biological evolution of physical form.\nThe concept of spiritual evolution is also complemented by the idea of a creative impulse in human beings, known as epigenesis. \n\n\"Agni Yoga\", in general, is a neo-theosophical religious doctrine transmitted by the Helena and Nicholas Roerichs from 1920. The followers of \"Living Ethics\" believe that the teaching was given to the Roerichs' family and their associates by Master Morya, the guru of Roerichs and Helena Blavatsky, one of the founders of the modern theosophical movement and the Theosophical Society. \"Teaching of Life\" is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind.\nThe most significant features of Agni Yoga are cosmism and universalism. They are expressed in the interpretation of any phenomena of human existence from the point of view of their cosmic significance and interrelation with the being of the Universe.\n\nThe Theosophical Society was officially formed in New York City on 17 November 1875 by Helena Blavatsky, Henry Steel Olcott, William Quan Judge, and others. It was self-described as \"an unsectarian body of seekers after Truth, who endeavour to promote Brotherhood and strive to serve humanity.\" After a few years Olcott and Blavatsky moved to India and established the International Headquarters at Adyar, in Madras. \n\nMadame Blavatsky (\"Upasica\" - this spiritual name means a female lay disciple. So the \"Teachers\" called HPB), the greatest occultist in the history of Western civilization, insisted that Theosophy is not a religion, although did refer to it as the modern transmission of the \"once universal religion\" that she claimed had existed deep into the human past. The motto of the Theosophical movement: There is no Religion higher than Truth.\n\nTheosophical organisations, regard it as a system that embraces what they see as the \"essential truth\" underlying religion, philosophy, and science. Theosophical groups allow their members to hold other religious allegiances, resulting in Theosophists who also identify as Christians, Buddhists, or Hindus.\n\nThe term Neo-Theosophy was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912. This term used by the followers of Helena Blavatsky to denominate the system of theosophical ideas expounded following the death of Blavatsky in 1891. This material differed in major respects from Blavatsky's original presentation, but it is accepted as genuinely theosophical by many theosophists around the world. Daryl S. Paulson associates \"Neo-Theosophy\" with Alice Bailey. She introduced the term New Age – Age of Aquarius. \n\nOther neo-theosophists include Rudolf Steiner's contemporary Peter Deunov and Samael Aun Weor. Dion Fortune and Aleister Crowley were also influencers of the leading edge of the theosophical movement. Some examples of neo-theosophists today include Benjamin Creme and Victor Skumin. So, in 1990, Skumin, based on the theosophical concept of spiritual evolution, proposed a classification of Homo spiritalis (Latin: \"Spiritual man\"), the sixth root race, consisting of eight sub-races (subspecies): \"HS-0\" Anabiosis spiritalis, \"HS-1\" Scientella spiritalis, \"HS-2\" Aurora spiritalis, \"HS-3\" Ascensus spiritalis, \"HS-4\" Vocatus spiritalis, \"HS-5\" Illuminatio spiritalis, \"НS-6\" Creatio spiritalis, and \"HS-7\" Servitus spiritalis.\n\nRussian philosophy as a separate entity started its development in the 19th century, defined initially by the opposition of Westernizers, advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and Slavophiles, insisting on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group included Nikolai Danilevsky and Konstantin Leontiev, the early founders of eurasianism. \"Slavophilia\" was an intellectual movement originating from 19th century that wanted the Russian Empire to be developed upon values and institutions derived from its early history. There were also similar movements in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Serbia. Depending on the historical context, its opposite could be termed Slavophobia, a fear of Slavic culture.\n\nThe discussion of Russia's place in the world has since become the most characteristic feature of Russian philosophy. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include Vladimir Solovyev, Vasily Rozanov, Lev Shestov, Leo Tolstoy, Sergei Bulgakov, Pavel Florensky, Pitirim Sorokin.In its further development, Russian philosophy was also marked by deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, religion, and Russian cosmism.\n\nVladimir Solovyov described his encounters with the entity \"Sophia\" in his works, such as \"Three Encounters\" and \"Lectures on Godmanhood\". His fusion was driven by the desire to reconcile or unite with Orthodox Christianity the various traditions by the Russian Slavophiles' concept of sobornost. His Russian religious philosophy had a very strong impact on the Russian Symbolist art movements of his time. His teachings on \"Sophia\", conceived as the merciful unifying feminine wisdom of God comparable to the Hebrew Shekinah or various goddess traditions, have been deemed a heresy by Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and as unsound and unorthodox by the Patriarchate of Moscow.\n\nNikolai Fyodorov was a Russian Orthodox Christian philosopher, who was part of the Russian cosmism movement and a precursor of transhumanism. Fedorov argued that humanity is the culmination of evolution, as well as its creator and director. Humans must therefore direct evolution where their reason and morality dictate. Fedorov stated that the struggle against death can become the most natural cause uniting all people, regardless of their nationality, race, citizenship or wealth. He called this the \"Common Cause\". Fedorov thought that death and afterdeath existence should become the subject of comprehensive scientific inquiry, that achieving immortality and revival is the greatest goal of science.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, there was a burst of scientific investigation into interplanetary travel, largely driven by the fiction writers such as Jules Verne and Herbert Wells as well as philosophical movements like Russian cosmism. In 1903, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky published the first serious scientific work on space travel. His work was essentially unknown outside the Russian Empire, but inside the country it inspired further research, experimentation and the formation of the Society for Studies of Interplanetary spaceflight. Tsiolkovsky wrote a book called \"The Will of the Universe; Unknown Intelligent Forces\" in which he propounded a philosophy of panpsychism. He believed humans would eventually colonize the Milky Way. His thought preceded the Space Age by several decades, and some of what he foresaw in his imagination has come into being since his death. Tsiolkovsky did not believe in traditional religious cosmology, but instead he believed in a cosmic being that governed humans.\n\nThe ideas of the Russian philosophers and cossmists later were developed by those in the transhumanist movement and Rerikhism.\nFor example, the Russian scientist Victor Skumin argues that the Culture of Health will play an important role in the creation of a human spiritual society into the Solar System.\n\nInformation about Vedanta and Buddhism spread in Western countries in the first decade of the 20th century. In the United States of the 1920s, when the voises in religion were arguing over fundamentalism and modernism as the only available choice, and long before Shangri-La had become a popularly accepted myth, a vanguard movement was promoting the alternative of the wisdom of the Eastern world.\n\nTheosophy proposed the existence of a society of Secret Chiefs called the Great White Brotherhood. The members of this Brotherhood, in belief systems akin to Theosophy and New Age, are said to be perfected beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans. The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or the Ascended Masters. They are referred to by theosophists as Elder Brothers of the human race, Adepts, Mahātmās, or simply as the Masters. The first person to talk about them in the West was Helena Blavatsky, after she and other people claimed to have received messages from them. These included Nicholas Roerich and Helena Roerich, too. She emphasized that knowledge was the leading path of all great Teachers. Knowledge will permit a free and vital approach to the great Teaching, as vitally real as is great Matter itself.\n\nWhen Nicholas Roerich passed away, his wife is believed to have carried on the work prescribed by Master Morya, “I exist only due to the ray of the Great Master, who said it was necessary for me to remain because no one could replace me as I worked under the highest Cosmic Sign, and this century was in need of my attainment”. The main aim of Helena Roerich was to spread the message of Agni Yoga.\n\nThe Agni Yoga Society was founded in 1920 by Helena and Nicholas Roerich. It is a non-profit educational institution incor|porated in 1946 under the laws of the State of New York, and is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and membership dues. The organization was located in the building \"Master Apartments\". The aims of the Society are embodied in the philosophy that gives it its name—Agni Yoga—as contained in the books of the Agni Yoga Series published by the Society. In them is found a synthesis of ancient Eastern beliefs and modern Western thought and a bridge between the spiritual and the scientific. \n\nUnlike previous yogas, Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. Though not systematized in an ordinary sense, it is a teaching that helps the student to discover moral and spiritual guide-posts by which to learn to govern his or her life and thus contribute to the common good. For this reason Agni Yoga has been called a \"Living ethic\". \nSpeaking about the role of personality in the spiritual evolution of mankind, Helena Roerich wrote,\nThe Latvian Roerich Society is one of the oldest society established by the Roerichs family. In 1920 Vladimir Schibayev, while being in London, met Nicholas and Helena Roerichs. In Riga they created a group of people to study Agni Yoga and another theosophical literature. In 1928, Schibayev went to India, to become the secretary of Roerich.\n\nIn Riga the place of the leader of Latvian Roerich Society was taken by doctor-homeopath Dr. Felix Lukin and his son Dr. conducted clinical trials are many natural medications that they received from Svetoslav Roerich of the Himalayan Research Institute named \"Urusvati\".\n\nIn 1936 officially became the president of the Latvian Society. During his lead, the books of Living Ethics, the works by the Roerichs, Helena Blavatsky’s and works by Rudzitis himself were published. In 1937 the first conference of Baltic Roerich Societies took place. The Latvian Society was renewed at the Soviet Union in 1988. Dr. Harald Lukin carried the Roerichs Banner of Peace. The new president Gunta Rudzite, the daughter of Rihard Rudzitis, held contacts with many people of the republics in the USSR who were interested in the ideas of Agni Yoga. On 2005 the Roerich Society received a social beneficial status in the Republic of Latvia.\n\nNicolas Roerich is known as a thinker and a builder of life. His art and writings are an evocation to Beauty, to Knowledge, and to Culture. His vision is nicely captured in his philosophical statement of the Master Institute of United Arts which he formed in New York City in 1921:\nMr. and Mrs. Horch financed and directed the Master Institute that taught the fine and dramatic arts. For much of its existence, the Master Institute was housed in the Master Apartments, designed by Harvery Wiley Corbett in 1929 for Roerich and built on the site of the former Horch mansion at 310 Riverside Dr. in New York City.\n\nRoerich planned to realize the educational concepts at the Institute. He invited as teachers such famous people as George Bellows, Claude Fayette Bragdon, Norman Bel Geddes, Stark Young, Deems Taylor, Robert Edmond Jones, and Lee Simonson. Intensive work was in process under direct supervision of Roerich. Nicholas gave lectures, organized new classes, for example classes of music and sculpture for the blind. Many representatives of American science and culture expressed their willingness to educate students according with the proposed curriculum. There were Felix Salmond, Ernest Bloch, and Michael Fokin. In the \"Institute of United Arts in New York City\" also taught Rockwell Kent, Claude Bragdon, George Bellows, and Norman Bel Geddes.\n\nSome contemporaries were skeptical spiritual mission of Nicholas Roerich. But those who embraced his philosophy experienced something transformative in his canvases. Roerich's name is universally known not only as Master of the brush but also as a thinker and a builder of life. The works of the Artist are an evocation to Beauty, to Knowledge, and to Culture.\n\nRoerich's family moved to India in December 1923. They settled in Darjeeling, a town in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is located in the Lower Himalayan Ranges at an elevation of .\n\nFrom 1925 to 1928, Roerichs took part in a Central Asia expedition, that traveled through hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of India, China, Soviet Union, Mongolia and Tibet. Sikkim was the starting point of the expedition. During the expedition, research in topics such as history, archeology, ethnography, history of philosophy, arts and religions, and geography was conducted. Rare manuscripts were found, and rich linguistic materials were collected. Special attention was paid to the problem of historical unity of cultures of various peoples. In 1925, Helena Roerich began to translate an extensive selection from \"The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett\". She also wrote a book named \"Chalice of the East\", which was published under the pen name \"Iskander Khanum\". Helena Roerich's manuscript \"Foundations of Buddhism\" was published in 1926, at Urga, where her expedition was staying at the time. In this book, the fundamental philosophical notions of Buddha's Teaching were interpreted.\n\nThe plethora of materials collected during the Central Asia Expedition became the foundation for the establishment of the Himalayan Research Institute named \"Urusvati\" in Darjeeling in 1928. A few months later the institute moved to Naggar in Kulu Valley.\n\nThe center engaged in scientific exchange with 285 institutes, universities, museums, and libraries around the world. George de Roerich was a world-renowned scientist, orientalist, and guru. His monumental translation of the \"Blue Annals\" (), and his 11-volume \"Tibetan-Russian-English dictionary with Sanskrit parallels\" were published in 1934.\n\nOne of his main focuses for the center was to bring people to the Institute who practiced and lived the cultures being examined by the center. George Roerich was the director of the Himalayan Research Institute named \"Urusvati\" for 10 years.\n\nSvetoslav Roerich was in charge of the work of the Natural Sciences Department. He carried out unique researches in various fields of the natural sciences. At the basis of his scientific investigations was understanding of nature as one whole that is inalienably connected with the cosmic laws. The scope of his interests: cultural studies, comparative religious studies and philosophy, botany, mineralogy, tibetan pharmacopoeia, chemistry and its alchemical sources.\n\nThe work of the Himalayan Research Institute was based on wide international cooperation. Major scientists and cultural workers collaborated with the Institute Urusvati. Such as Soviet academician Nikolai Vavilov, biologist and biophysicist Jagadish Chandra Bose, Bengali polymath Rabindranath Tagore, the father of Indian journalism Ramananda Chatterjee, Indian philosopher and statesman Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Swedish geographer and explorer Sven Hedin, and many others.\n\n\"The Journal of the Urusvati Himalayan Research Institute (U.J.)\" published articles on various aspects of science and culture. The publications presented a multi-level perception of the authors who were looking for a new integration of different cultural models in the mainstream of Agni Yoga.\n\nThe Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City was originally located in the Master Apartments at 103rd Street and Riverside Drive (Manhattan), which were built especially for Roerich in 1929. Now the museum is located in a brownstone at 319 West 107th Street on Manhattan's Upper West Side. This Museum is one of the most off-the-beaten-path of Manhattan's museums, a collection of works by Nicolas Roerich, who lived on the Upper West Side for a time in the 1920's. The brownstone is chock-full of amazing natural scenes from the Himalayas, where this artist spent two decades of his life. Roerich usually painted in stark tempera, with blazing orange skies or impossibly deep blue mountains.\n\nCurrently, the museum includes between 100 and 200 of Roerich's works as well as a collection of archival materials and still attracts pilgrims from throughout the world. The mission of the Nicholas Roerich Museum is one: to make available to the public the full range of Roerich’s accomplishments. They cover the realms of art, science, spirituality, peacemaking, and more.\n\nThe Museum seeks to realize the ideas of Agni Yoga on the role of culture in the evolution of the world and evolution of the human consciousness. Information about these Roerich's ideas is always available. The museum also provides an opportunity for young musicians to perform in front of an audience on a voluntary and free basis.\n\nThe Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York is the largest center of Roerich-related activity outside of Russian Federation.\n\n\"The International Center of the Roerichs\" (Russian: \"Междунаро́дный це́нтр Ре́рихов\") is a non-governmental public association of citizens and public associations incorporated on the basis of their common interests in the cause of study, preservation, and popularization of the Roerich family \nheritage. The Center is an associated member of the Non-Governmental Organizations Association under the United Nations Department of Public Information. Conducting its activities, this International public organization proceeds from the applicable the law of the states in which its structural divisions are acting, the United Nations Charter, norms of the International law and International legal acts related to the Center’s sphere of activity.\n\n\"Museum named after Nicholas Roerich\" (Russian: \"Музе́й и́мени Н. К. Ре́риха Междунаро́дного це́нтра Ре́рихов\") contents comprises the Roerichs' cultural heritage passed on to the Soviet Roerichs' Foundation (now International Center of the Roerichs) by Svetoslav Roerich in 1990. It carries in itself a new cosmic world view for which new interest grows more each year. The core of the Rerikhism is the philosophy of cosmic reality – the Agni Yoga, which develops the idea of a close relationship between man and Cosmos, contains knowledge which assists in understanding the specific features peculiar to the new evolutionary stage of mankind's development.\n\n\"The World Organisation of Culture of Health (WOCH)\" — International social movement \"To Health via Culture\" (Russian: Междунаро́дное обще́ственное Движе́ние «К Здоро́вью че́рез Культу́ру») was founded in the year 1994. Victor Skumin was elected to the post of the President-founder of this organisation. The WOCH operates in accordance with the registered in Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation Charter.\n\nIn Agni Yoga much attention is paid to health. So in the book \"Supermundane\" (paragraph 525) recorded the words of Master Morya, addressed to Urusvati,\n\nIt is from these positions that WOCH approaches the solution of problems related to health. As \"Holy Scripture of Agni Yoga\" says, physicians can be true helpers of humanity in the ascent of the spirit. The intellect of a physician must be reinforced by his heart. The physician must be a psychologist, and he must not ignore the wondrous psychic energy.\n\nProf. Verhorubova and Prof. Lobanova from Tomsk State Pedagogical University argued (2012) that in accordance with the concept of a culture of health, proposed by Skumin, the culture – spiritual, mental, and physical – determines the status of human health. And health – spiritual, mental, physical – is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture.\n\nThe World Organisation of Culture of Health, in order to promote international relations, has established a link with the International Buddhist Meditation Centre.\n\nThe anthem of WOCH (\"To Health via Culture\") consists of four stanzas. The capital letters each of the four stanzas form the word Agni. (). Another anthem by Skumin is termed \"Urusvati\". Helena Roerich, known as the \"Tara Urusvati\" in Agni Yoga and Rerikhism. This anthem begins with the phrase, \"The fire of the heart ignites Urusvati, she teaches the spirit take-off on the wings of the grace\". Six more hymns have the names: \"Heart\", \"Shambhala\", \"Morya\", \"Ur\", \"Agni\", and \"Sun\".\n\nIn the Russian Orthodox Church the social activities of this international organization qualifies as an ideology of the Agni Yoga and New Age (NA),\n\nThe WOCH has its own publishing house (\"To Health via Culture\"), who has the right to publish the books with the International Standard Book Number (ISBN). \"The Journal of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (″World Health Culture Organization″)\" is based in Novocheboksarsk. The journal received an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) 0204-3440. The main topics of the magazine are the dissemination of ideas of culture of health, holistic medicine, Rerikhism, and Agni Yoga.\n\nThe beginning of the religious and philosophical \"series of Agni Yoga\" was delivered on March 24, 1920. These Roerichs records eventually became the \"Holy Scripture\", consisting of a series of books with a total volume of about 5000 pages.\n\n\nMany works of Nicholas Roerich and Svetoslav Roerich, as an artists, are thematically related to Agni Yoga. Roerichs artistic works speak about the internal needs of the individual and about the ways of their realization. Roerich's paintings are a kind of \"Teaching of Life\", on the spiritual development of mankind, about culture and its role in human life. This is a conversation about the Eternity.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "81456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=81456", "title": "Brian Jones", "text": "Brian Jones\n\nLewis Brian Hopkin Jones (28 February 1942 – 3 July 1969) was an English musician, best known as the founder and the original leader of the Rolling Stones. Initially a slide guitarist, Jones would go on to play a wide variety of instruments on Rolling Stones recordings and in concerts, such as rhythm and lead guitar, various keyboard instruments such as piano and organ, marimba, harmonica, sitar, wind instruments such as recorder, saxophone and numerous others.\n\nJones and fellow guitarist Keith Richards developed a unique style of guitar play that Richards refers to as the \"ancient art of weaving\" where both players would play rhythm and lead parts together; Richards would carry the style on with later Stones guitarists and the sound would become a Rolling Stones trademark.\n\nAfter he founded the Rolling Stones as a British blues outfit in 1962, and gave the band its name, Jones' fellow band members Mick Jagger and Keith Richards began to take over the band's musical direction, especially after they became a successful songwriting team. Jones also did not get along with the band's manager, Andrew Loog Oldham, who pushed the band into a musical direction at odds with Jones' blues background. At the same time, Jones developed alcohol and drugs problems, and his performance in the studio became increasingly unreliable, leading to a diminished role within the band he had founded. The Rolling Stones asked Jones to leave in June 1969 and guitarist Mick Taylor took his place in the group. Jones died less than a month later by drowning in the swimming pool at his home while under the influence of alcohol and drugs.\n\nLong-time Rolling Stones bass guitarist Bill Wyman said of Jones, \"He formed the band. He chose the members. He named the band. He chose the music we played. He got us gigs. ... he was very influential, very important, and then slowly lost it – highly intelligent – and just kind of wasted it and blew it all away.\"\n\nLewis Brian Hopkin Jones was born in the Park Nursing Home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, on 28 February 1942. An attack of croup at the age of four left him with asthma, which lasted for the rest of his life. His middle-class parents, Lewis Blount Jones and Louisa Beatrice Jones (née Simmonds) were of Welsh descent. Brian had two sisters: Pamela, who was born on 3 October 1943 and died on 14 October 1945 of leukemia; and Barbara, born on 22 August 1946.\n\nBoth Jones' parents were interested in music: his father, Lewis, was a piano teacher in addition to his job as an aeronautical engineer, and his mother, Louisa, played piano and organ and led the choir at the local church.\n\nIn 1957 Jones first heard Cannonball Adderley's music, which inspired his interest in jazz. Jones persuaded his parents to buy him a saxophone and two years later his parents gave him his first acoustic guitar as a 17th birthday present.\n\nJones attended local schools, including Dean Close School, from September 1949 to July 1953 and Cheltenham Grammar School for Boys, which he entered in September 1953 after passing the Eleven-plus exam. He enjoyed badminton and diving at school and attained first clarinet in the school orchestra. In 1957 he reportedly obtained seven O-level passes, then he continued into the sixth form and obtained a further two O-levels. He also took three A-levels in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and passed in Physics and Chemistry, but failed in Biology. Jones was able to perform well in exams despite a lack of academic effort. However, he found school regimented and disliked conforming. He disliked the school uniforms and angered teachers with his behaviour, though he was popular with classmates. Jones himself said: \"When I made the sixth form I found myself accepted by the older boys; suddenly I was in.\"\n\nHis hostility to authority figures resulted in his suspension from school on two occasions. According to Dick Hattrell, a childhood friend: \"He was a rebel without a cause, but when examinations came he was brilliant.\"\n\nIn late summer 1959, Jones' 17-year-old girlfriend, a Cheltenham schoolgirl named Valerie Corbett, became pregnant. Although Jones is said to have encouraged her to have an abortion, she carried the child to term and placed baby Barry David (later Simon) for adoption.\n\nJones quit school in disgrace and left home, travelling for a summer through Northern Europe and Scandinavia. During this period, he lived a bohemian lifestyle, busking with his guitar on the streets for money, and living off the charity of others. Eventually, he ran short of money and returned to England.\n\nJones listened to classical music as a child, but preferred blues, particularly Elmore James and Robert Johnson. He began performing at local blues and jazz clubs, while busking and working odd jobs. He reportedly stole small amounts of money from work to pay for cigarettes, for which he was fired.\n\nIn November 1959, Jones went to the Wooden Bridge Hotel in Guildford to see a band perform. He met a young married woman named Angeline, and the two had a one-night stand that resulted in her pregnancy. Angeline and her husband decided to raise the baby, Carolyn, born on 4 August 1960. Jones never knew about her birth.\n\nIn 1961, Jones applied for a scholarship to Cheltenham Art College. He was initially accepted into the programme, but two days later the offer was withdrawn after an unidentified acquaintance wrote to the college, calling Jones an irresponsible drifter.\n\nOn 22 October 1961, Jones' girlfriend Pat Andrews gave birth to his third child, Julian Mark Andrews. Jones sold his record collection to buy flowers for Pat and clothes for the newborn. He lived with them for a while. On 23 July 1964 another woman, Linda Lawrence (later married to Donovan), gave birth to Jones' fourth child, Julian Brian. In early October 1964, an occasional girlfriend of Brian's, Dawn Molloy, announced to Brian and the band's management that she was pregnant by Brian. She received a cheque for £700 () from Oldham. In return, she signed an agreement that the matter was now closed and she would make no statement about Brian Jones or the child to the public or the press. The undated statement was signed by Molloy and witnessed by Mick Jagger.\n\nJones left Cheltenham and moved to London where he became friends with fellow musicians Alexis Korner, future Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, then named Paul Pond, future Cream bassist Jack Bruce, and others who made up the small London rhythm and blues and jazz scene there. He became a blues musician, for a brief time calling himself \"Elmo Lewis\", and playing slide guitar. Jones also started a group with Paul Jones called the \"Roosters\" and in January 1963, after both Brian and Paul left the group, Eric Clapton took over Brian's position as guitarist.\n\nJones placed an advertisement in \"Jazz News\" (a Soho club information sheet) on 2 May 1962, inviting musicians to audition for a new R&B group at the Bricklayer's Arms pub; pianist Ian \"Stu\" Stewart was the first to respond. Later singer Mick Jagger also joined this band; Jagger and his childhood friend Keith Richards had met Jones when he and Paul Jones were playing Elmore James' \"Dust My Broom\" with Korner's band at the Ealing Jazz Club. Jagger brought guitarist Richards to rehearsals; Richards then joined the band. Jones' and Stewart's acceptance of Richards and the Chuck Berry songs he wanted to play coincided with the departure of blues purists Geoff Bradford and Brian Knight, who had no tolerance for Chuck Berry.\n\nAs Keith Richards tells it, Jones came up with the name the \"Rollin' Stones\" (later with the 'g') while on the phone with a venue owner. \"The voice on the other end of the line obviously said, 'What are you called?' Panic! \"The Best of Muddy Waters\" album was lying on the floor—and track five, side one was 'Rollin' Stone Blues'\".\n\nThe Rollin' Stones played their first gig on 12 July 1962 in the Marquee Club in London with Jagger, Richards, Jones, Stewart, bass player Dick Taylor (later of the Pretty Things) and drummer Tony Chapman.\n\nFrom September 1962 to September 1963 Jones, Jagger and Richards shared a flat (referred to by Richards as \"a beautiful dump\") at 102 Edith Grove, Chelsea, with James Phelge, a future photographer whose name was used in some of the group's early \"Nanker/Phelge\" writing credits. Jones and Richards spent day after day playing guitar while listening to blues records (notably Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon and Howlin' Wolf). During this time, Jones also taught Jagger how to play harmonica.\n\nThe four Rollin' Stones went searching for a bassist and drummer, finally settling on Bill Wyman on bass because he had a spare VOX AC30 guitar amplifier and always had cigarettes, as well as a bass guitar that he had built himself. After playing with Mick Avory, Tony Chapman and Carlo Little, in January 1963 they finally persuaded jazz-influenced Charlie Watts to join them. At the time, Watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in London; he had played with (among others) Alexis Korner's group Blues Incorporated.\n\nWatts described Jones' role in these early days: \"Brian was very instrumental in pushing the band at the beginning. Keith and I would look at him and say he was barmy. It was a crusade to him to get us on the stage in a club and be paid half-a-crown and to be billed as an R&B band\".\n\nWhile acting as the band's business manager, Jones received £5 more than the other members (), which did not sit well with the rest of the band and created resentment. Keith Richards has said that both he and Jagger were surprised to learn that Jones considered himself the leader and was receiving the extra £5, especially as other people, like Giorgio Gomelsky, appeared to be doing the booking.\n\nJones was a talented multi-instrumentalist, seemingly at home on any musical instrument. For many Rolling Stones tracks prior to 1969, for any instrument except the standard rock instrumentation of drums, guitars, piano, or bass, Jones would be the one playing it. His aptitude for playing a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums \"Aftermath\" (1966), \"Between the Buttons\" (1967) and \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\" (1967). As a guitarist, in the early days he favored a white teardrop-shaped electric guitar produced by the Vox company especially in live performances; he also played a wide variety of electric and acoustic guitars from companies such as Rickenbacker, Gibson, and Fender. \nAs a slide guitarist, Jones favored the open E tuning and open G tuning.\n\nExamples of Jones' contributions are his slide guitar on \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" (1963), \"I'm a King Bee\", \"Little Red Rooster\" (1964), \"I'm Movin' On\" (1965), \"Doncha Bother Me\" and \"No Expectations\". Jones can also be heard playing Bo Diddley-style rhythm guitar on \"I Need You Baby\" and on \"Please Go Home\", the guitar riff in \"The Last Time\"; sitar on \"Street Fighting Man\" and \"Paint It Black\"; organ on \"Let's Spend the Night Together\"; marimba on \"Under My Thumb\", \"Out of Time\" and \"Yesterday's Papers\"; recorder on \"Ruby Tuesday\" and \"All Sold Out\"; saxophone on \"Child of the Moon\" and \"Citadel\"; kazoo on \"Cool, Calm And Collected\"; Appalachian dulcimer on \"I Am Waiting\" and \"Lady Jane\", Mellotron on \"She's a Rainbow\", \"We Love You\", \"Stray Cat Blues\", \"2000 Light Years from Home\", and \"Citadel\"; and the autoharp on \"Ride On, Baby\" and (for his final recording as a Rolling Stone) on \"You Got the Silver\". He also played the oboe/soprano sax solo in \"Dandelion\".\n\nJones also played harmonica on many of the Rolling Stones' early songs. Examples of Jones' playing are on \"Come On\", \"Stoned\" (1963), \"Not Fade Away\" (1964), \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\", \"Now I've Got A Witness\" (1964), \"Good Times, Bad Times\" (1964), \"2120 South Michigan Avenue\" (1964) (from E.P. \"Five By Five\"), \"The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man\", \"One More Try\" (1965), \"High and Dry\" and \"Goin' Home\" (1966), \"Who's Driving Your Plane?\" (1966), \"Cool Calm and Collected\", \"Who's Been Sleeping Here\" (1967), and \"Dear Doctor\" and \"Prodigal Son\" (1968).\n\nIn the early years, Jones often served as a backing vocalist. Notable examples are \"Come On\", \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", \"I Just Wanna Make Love to You\", \"Walking the Dog\", \"Money\", \"I'm Alright\", \"You Better Move On\" and \"It's All Over Now\". He contributed backing vocals as late as 1968 on \"Sympathy for the Devil\". He is also responsible for the whistling on \"Walking the Dog\".\n\nRichards maintains that what he calls \"guitar weaving\" emerged from this period, from listening to Jimmy Reed albums: \"We listened to the teamwork, trying to work out what was going on in those records; how you could play together with two guitars and make it sound like four or five\". Jones' and Richards' guitars became a signature of the sound of the Rolling Stones, with both guitarists playing rhythm and lead without clear boundaries between the two roles.\n\nAndrew Loog Oldham's arrival as manager marked the beginning of Jones' slow estrangement. Oldham recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers' writing their own songs, as exemplified by Lennon–McCartney, and that playing covers would not sustain a band in the limelight for long. Further, Oldham wanted to make Jagger's charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances. Jones saw his influence over the Stones' direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers than he preferred; more Jagger/Richards originals developed, and Oldham increased his own managerial control, displacing Jones from yet another role.\n\nAccording to Oldham in his book \"Stoned\", Jones was an outsider from the beginning. When the first tours were arranged in 1963, he travelled separately from the band, stayed at different hotels, and demanded extra pay. According to Oldham, Jones was very emotional and felt alienated because he was not a prolific songwriter and his management role had been taken away. He \"resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle, and so life was becoming more desperate for him day by day. None of us were looking forward to Brian totally cracking up\".\n\nThe toll from days on the road, the money and fame, and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in Jones' overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs. These excesses had a debilitative effect on his physical and mental health and, according to Oldham, Jones became unfriendly and antisocial at times.\n\nJones was arrested for drug possession on 10 May 1967, shortly after the \"Redlands\" incident at Richards' Sussex home. Authorities found marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamine in his flat. He confessed to marijuana use but claimed he did not use hard drugs.\n\nIn June 1967, Jones attended the Monterey Pop Festival. There he met Frank Zappa and Dennis Hopper, and went on stage to introduce the Jimi Hendrix Experience who were not yet well known in the United States.\n\nHostility grew between Jones, Jagger, and Richards, alienating Jones further from the group. Although many noted that Jones could be friendly and outgoing, Wyman, Richards, and Watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult. By most accounts, Jones' attitude changed frequently; he was one minute caring and generous, the next making an effort to anger everyone. As Wyman observed in \"Stone Alone\": \"There were at least two sides to Brian's personality. One Brian was introverted, shy, sensitive, deep-thinking. The other was a preening peacock, gregarious, artistic, desperately needing assurance from his peers.\" \"He pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond\".\n\nIn March 1967, Anita Pallenberg, Jones' girlfriend of two years, left him for Richards when Jones was hospitalised during a trip the three made to Morocco, further damaging the already strained relations between Jones and Richards. As tensions and Jones' substance abuse increased, his musical contributions became sporadic. He became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play, and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions. In Peter Whitehead's promotional film for \"We Love You\", made in July 1967, he appears extremely groggy and disoriented.\n\nJones' last substantial sessions with the Stones occurred in spring and summer of 1968 when the Stones produced \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" and the \"Beggars Banquet\" album. He can be seen in the Jean-Luc Godard film \"One Plus One\" playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with Richards, although Jones is neglected in the music-making. The film chronicles the making of \"Sympathy for the Devil\".\n\nWhere once Jones played multiple instruments on many tracks, he now played only minor roles on a few pieces. Jones' last formal appearance was in the December 1968 \"The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus\", a part concert, part circus-act film organised by the band. It went unreleased for more than 25 years because Jagger was unhappy with the band's performance compared to others in the film such as Jethro Tull, John Lennon, The Who, and Taj Mahal. Commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that the end of Jones' time with the Rolling Stones was near, and Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend of The Who thought it would be Jones' last live musical performance.\n\nJones was arrested a second time on 21 May 1968, for possession of cannabis, which Jones said had been left by previous tenants of the flat. Due to his being on probation, he was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty. The jury found him guilty but the judge had sympathy for Jones; instead of jailing him, he fined him £50 () plus £105 in costs () and told him: \"For goodness sake, don't get into trouble again or it really \"will\" be serious\".\n\nJones' legal troubles, estrangement from his bandmates, substance abuse, and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to his active participation in the band. The Rolling Stones wanted to tour the United States in 1969 for the first time in three years but Jones was not in fit condition to tour and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a US work visa. In addition, Jones' attendance at rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic; and when he did appear he either rarely contributed anything musically or, when he did, his bandmates would switch off his amplifier, leaving Richards to play nearly all the guitars. According to author Gary Herman, Jones was \"literally incapable of making music; when he tried to play harmonica his mouth started bleeding\".\n\nThis behaviour was problematic during the \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\" and \"Beggar's Banquet\" sessions and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording \"Let It Bleed\". In March 1969, Jones borrowed the group's Jaguar and went shopping in Pimlico Road. After the parked car was towed away by police, Jones hired a chauffeur-driven car to get home. In May 1969, Jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to hospital under an assumed name. From this point, Jones was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the band's music. By May, he had made two contributions to the work in progress: autoharp on \"You Got the Silver\" and percussion on \"Midnight Rambler\". Jagger informed Jones that he would be fired from the band if he did not turn up to a photo session. Looking frail, he nonetheless showed up and his last photo session as a Rolling Stone took place on 21 May 1969, first at St. Katherine Docks, Tower Bridge, London and then at Ethan Russell's photographic studio in South Kensington. The photos would appear on the album \"Through The Past Darkly (Big Hits Vol.2)\" in September 1969.\n\nThe Stones decided that following the release of the \"Let it Bleed\" album (scheduled for a July 1969 release in the US) they would start a North American tour in November 1969. However, the Stones management was informed that because of his drug convictions Jones would not receive a work permit. At the suggestion of pianist and road manager Ian Stewart, the Stones decided to add a new guitarist and, on 8 June 1969, Jones was visited by Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Charlie Watts and was told that the group he had formed would continue without him.\n\nTo the public it appeared as if Jones had left voluntarily; the other band members told him that although he was being asked to leave, it was his choice how to break it to the public. Jones released a statement on 9 June 1969, announcing his departure. In this statement he said, among other things, that \"I no longer see eye-to-eye with the others over the discs we are cutting\". Jones was replaced by the 20-year-old guitarist formerly of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Mick Taylor.\n\nDuring the period of his decreasing involvement in the band Jones was living at Cotchford Farm in East Sussex, the residence formerly owned by \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" author A. A. Milne which Jones had purchased in November 1968. Alexis Korner, who visited in late June, noted that Jones seemed \"happier than he had ever been\". Jones is known to have contacted Korner, Ian Stewart, John Lennon, Mitch Mitchell, and Jimmy Miller about intentions to put together another band. Jones had apparently demoed a few of his own songs in the weeks before his death, including \"Has Anybody Seen My Baby?\" and \"Chow Time\".\n\nJones' main guitar in the early years was a Harmony Stratotone, which he replaced with a Gretsch Double Anniversary in two-tone green. In 1964 and 1965, he often used a teardrop-shaped prototype Vox Mark III. From late 1965 until his death, Jones used Gibson models (various Firebirds, ES-330, and a Les Paul model), as well as two Rickenbacker 12-string models. He can also be seen playing a Fender Telecaster in the 1968 \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" promo video.\n\nAt around midnight on the night of 2–3 July 1969, Jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at Cotchford Farm. His Swedish girlfriend, Anna Wohlin, was convinced Jones was alive when he was taken out of the pool, insisting he still had a pulse. However, by the time the doctors arrived it was too late and he was pronounced dead. The coroner's report stated \"death by misadventure\" and noted his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nUpon Jones' death, the Who's Pete Townshend wrote a poem titled \"A Normal Day for Brian, A Man Who Died Every Day\" (printed in \"The Times\"), Jimi Hendrix dedicated a song to him on US television, and Jim Morrison of The Doors published a poem titled \"Ode to L.A. While Thinking of Brian Jones, Deceased\". Coincidentally, Hendrix and Morrison both died within the following two years.\n\nThe Rolling Stones performed at a free concert in Hyde Park on 5 July 1969, two days after Jones' death. The concert had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present the Stones' new guitarist, Mick Taylor, and the band decided to dedicate the concert to Jones. Before the Rolling Stones' set Jagger read excerpts from \"Adonais\", a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley about the death of his friend John Keats, and stagehands released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute. The band opened with a Johnny Winter song that was one of Jones' favourites, \"I'm Yours and I'm Hers\".\n\nJones was reportedly buried deep in Cheltenham Cemetery (to prevent exhumation by trophy hunters). His body was embalmed, hair bleached white, and was placed in an air-tight metal casket. Watts and Wyman were the only Rolling Stones who attended the funeral. Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull were travelling to Australia to begin the filming of \"Ned Kelly\"; they stated that their contracts did not allow them to delay the trip to attend the funeral.\n\nWhen asked if he felt guilty about Jones' death, Mick Jagger told \"Rolling Stone\" in 1995: \"No, I don't really. I do feel that I behaved in a very childish way, but we were very young, and in some ways we picked on him. But, unfortunately, he made himself a target for it; he was very, very jealous, very difficult, very manipulative, and if you do that in this kind of a group of people you get back as good as you give, to be honest. I wasn't understanding enough about his drug addiction. No one seemed to know much about drug addiction. Things like LSD were all new. No one knew the harm. People thought cocaine was good for you.\"\n\nTheories surrounding Jones' death developed soon afterwards with associates of the Stones claiming to have information that he was murdered. According to rock biographer Philip Norman, \"the murder theory would bubble back to the surface every five years or so\". In 1993 it was reported that Jones was murdered by Frank Thorogood, who was doing some construction work on the property. He was the last person to see Jones alive. Thorogood allegedly confessed the murder to the Rolling Stones' driver, Tom Keylock, who later denied this. The Thorogood theory was dramatised in the 2005 movie \"Stoned\".\n\nIn August 2009, Sussex Police decided to review Jones' death for the first time since 1969, after new evidence was handed to them by Scott Jones, an investigative journalist in the UK. Scott Jones had traced many of the people who were at Brian Jones' house the night he died plus unseen police files held at the National Archives. According to Trevor Hobley, chairman of the Brian Jones Fan Club, a neighbour saw a large bonfire on Jones' estate in which documentation was being burned on the morning of Jones' death as he was leaving for work at 7 a.m.\n\nIn the \"Mail on Sunday\" in November 2008, Scott Jones said Frank Thorogood killed Brian Jones in a fight and senior police officers covered up the true cause of death. Following the review the Sussex police stated that they would not be reopening the case. They asserted that \"this has been thoroughly reviewed by Sussex Police's Crime Policy and Review Branch but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroner's original verdict of 'death by misadventure' was incorrect.\"\n\nUnsure and insecure as a composer, Jones was not a prolific songwriter. The 30-second \"Rice Krispies\" jingle for Kellogg's, co-written with the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in 1963 and performed by The Rolling Stones incognito was credited to Jones; this did not sit well with the rest of the band, who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally. Jones was also included in the \"Nanker/Phelge\" songwriting credit, a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and Andrew Oldham.\n\nAccording to Andrew Oldham, the main reason for Jones' not writing songs was that Jones, being a blues purist, did not love simple pop music enough. Oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between Jones and Gene Pitney after \"becoming bored senseless by Jones' bleating about the potential of half-finished melodies that by no means deserved completion\", but after two days of sessions \"the results remain best to be unheard, even by Rolling Stones' completists\".\n\nWhen asked in 1965 if he had written songs, Jones replied: \"Always tried. I've written quite a few, but mostly in blues style\". Many years later after his death, Keith Richards stated: \"No, no, absolutely not. That was the one thing he would never do. Brian wouldn't show them to anybody within the Stones. Brian as far as I know never wrote a single finished song in his life; he wrote bits and pieces but he never presented them to us. No doubt he spent hours, weeks, working on things, but his paranoia was so great that he could never bring himself to present them to us\". In 1995, Mick Jagger told \"Rolling Stone\" magazine that Jones had been jealous of the Jagger/Richards songwriting team, and added: \"To be honest, Brian had no talent for writing songs. None. I've never known a guy with less talent for songwriting.\"\n\nMarianne Faithfull reported that Jones wrote an early version of the melody for \"Ruby Tuesday\" and presented it to the group. Victor Bockris reported that Keith Richards and Brian Jones worked out the final melody in the studio. Additionally, Jones is credited (along with Keith Richards) for the instrumental piece \"Hear It\". However, in 1966 Jones composed, produced, and played on the soundtrack to \"Mord und Totschlag\" (English title: \"A Degree Of Murder\"), an avant-garde German film with Anita Pallenberg, adding the majority of the instrumentation to the soundtrack.\n\nThe only known released Brian Jones song is \"(Thank You) For Being There\", which reportedly is a poem by Jones put to music by Carla Olson. It appeared on the 1990 album \"True Voices\" as performed by Krysia Kristianne and Robin Williamson.\n\nIn summer 1968, Jones recorded the Morocco-based ensemble, the Master Musicians of Joujouka (Jajouka), which was later used by the band; the recording was released in 1971 as \"Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka\". Jagger and Richards visited Jajouka in 1989 after recording \"Continental Drift\" for the Rolling Stones album \"Steel Wheels\" with The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar in Tangier. A homage to Jones entitled \"Brian Jones Joujouka very Stoned\", painted by Mohamed Hamri, who had brought Jones to Jajouka in 1967, appeared on the cover of \"Joujouka Black Eyes\" by the Master Musicians of Joujouka in 1995, this being a splinter group created by an Irish friend of the former and estranged Moroccan manager, Mohamed Hamri.\n\n\"Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Jajouka\" was rereleased in co-operation with Bachir Attar and Philip Glass in 1995. The executive producers were Philip Glass, Kurt Munkacsi and Rory Johnston, with notes by Bachir Attar, Paul Bowles, William S. Burroughs, Stephen Davis, Brian Jones, Brion Gysin and David Silver. and included additional graphics, more extensive notes by David Silver and William S. Burroughs, and a second CD, produced by Cliff Mark, with two \"full-length remixes\". \nJones played alto saxophone on The Beatles song \"You Know My Name\", which was released in March 1970, eight months after his death. Jones also played percussion on the Jimi Hendrix song \"All Along the Watchtower\": \"that's him playing the \"thwack\" you hear at the end of each bar in the intro, on an instrument called a vibraslap.\"\n\nAnita Pallenberg has stated in an interview that he wanted to look like Françoise Hardy, he loved \"dressing up and posing about\" and that he would ask her to do his hair and make-up. Bo Diddley described Brian as \"a little dude that was trying to pull the group ahead. I saw him as the leader. He didn't take no mess. He was a fantastic cat; he handled the group beautifully.\"\n\nJones' death at 27 was the first of the 1960s rock movement; Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison found their own drug-related deaths at the same age within two years (Morrison died two years to the day after Jones). The coincidence of ages has been described as the \"27 Club\". When Alastair Johns, who owned Cotchford Farm for over 40 years after Jones' death, refurbished the pool, he sold the original tiles to Jones' fans for £100 each, which paid for half of the work. Johns noted that Cotchford Farm remained for decades an attraction for Jones' fans.\n\nSongs have been written about Jones: Morrison originally wrote the Doors' song \"Tightrope Ride\" for Jones, but after Morrison's death Ray Manzarek rewrote some of the lyrics so that they apply to both musicians. The Psychic TV song \"Godstar\" is about Jones' death, as are Robyn Hitchcock's \"Trash\", The Drovers' \"She's as Pretty as Brian Jones Was\", Jeff Dahl's \"Mick and Keith killed Brian\", Ted Nugent's \"Death by Misadventure\", and Salmonblaster's \"Brian Jones\". Toy Love's song \"Swimming Pool\" lists several dead rock icons including Jones (the others are Morrison, Hendrix, and Marc Bolan) just as A House's \"Endless Art\" does; Jones is also mentioned in De Phazz's song \"Something Special\". The Master Musicians of Joujouka song \"Brian Jones Joujouka Very Stoned\" was released in 1974 and 1996. The band Tigers Jaw heavily references Jones and his death in their song \"I Saw Water\". English group Ultimate Painting recorded \"Song For Brian Jones\" for their 2016 album \"Dusk\".\n\nMany of his contemporaries admit to idolising him as young musicians, including Noel Redding, who, according to Pamela Des Barres' book \"I'm With the Band\", contemplated suicide after hearing about his death.\n\nThe Brian Jonestown Massacre, an American psychedelic rock band, take their name partly from Jones and are heavily influenced by his work.\n\nThe 2005 film \"Stoned\" is a fictional account of Jones and his role in the Rolling Stones. The part of Brian was played by English actor Leo Gregory.\n\nA fictionalised version of Jones and the tribute concert to him appears in Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's \"\" in its second issue, \"Paint it Black\".\n\nHis exceptional musicianship as well as contribution to the band is featured heavily in the documentary \"Crossfire Hurricane\".\n\nWith the Rolling Stones\n\nWith the Beatles\n\nWith Jimi Hendrix\n\nWith Peter and Gordon\n\nWith McGough and McGear\n\nWith Marianne Faithfull\n\nWith The Andrew Oldham Orchestra\n\nWith Hapshash and the Coloured Coat\n\nSolo discography\n\n"}
{"id": "25960352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25960352", "title": "Canasatego", "text": "Canasatego\n\nCanassatego (c. 1684–1750) was a leader of the Onondaga nation who became a prominent diplomat and spokesman of the Iroquois Confederacy in the 1740s. He was involved in several controversial land sales to British American officials. He is now best known for a speech he gave at the 1744 Treaty of Lancaster, where he recommended that the British colonies emulate the Iroquois by forming a confederacy. He was reportedly assassinated, perhaps by sympathizers or agents of New France.\n\nCanassatego only appears in historical documents for the final eight years of his life, and so little is known of his background. His earliest documented appearance is at a treaty conference in Philadelphia in 1742, where he was a spokesman for the Onondaga people, one of the six nations of the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) League. According to most modern scholars, Canasatego was apparently not one of the fourteen Onondaga hereditary sachems who sat on the Iroquois Grand Council. One modern source disagrees, however, maintaining that Canasatego held the League title of Tadadaho.\n\nIn the 1730s, a faction of Iroquois leaders opened a diplomatic relationship with the British Province of Pennsylvania, facilitated by Conrad Weiser, Pennsylvania's interpreter and agent. Pennsylvania agreed to recognize the Iroquois as the owner of all Indian lands in Pennsylvania; the Iroquois, in turn, agreed to sell lands only to Pennsylvania. Canasatego probably attended a 1736 treaty where some Iroquois chiefs sold land along the Susquehanna River to Pennsylvania, even though the Iroquois did not really have a claim to this land.\n\nCanassatego served as the speaker for Onondagas at another conference in 1742, where the Iroquois chiefs collected the final payment for the 1736 land sale. At this meeting, Canassatego managed to convince Governor Thomas Penn to pay more than the original purchase price. Penn, for his part, urged Canassatego to remove the Delaware Indians from the land purchased in the controversial Walking Purchase of 1737. Canassatego complied, berating the Delawares as \"women\" who had no right to sell land, and ordering them to leave. \"You are women; take the Advice of a Wise Man and remove immediately\", he told the Delawares. The Iroquois designation of the Delawares as \"women\" has been the subject of much scholarly writing.\n\nIn 1744, Canassatego served as a speaker at the Treaty of Lancaster. Witham Marshe, a Marylander in attendance, recorded the only written description of Canassatego:\n\nAt the treaty conference were representatives of the Iroquois nations (except the Mohawks), and the provinces of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. With King George's War underway, the British colonies needed to cultivate a good relationship with their Iroquois neighbors, who might otherwise become French allies. After a speech by Canassatego, officials from Maryland and Virginia agreed to pay the Iroquois for land in their colonies, even though they knew that the Iroquois had no legitimate claim to those lands. Virginia got the better part of the deal, however: although Canassatego and other Iroquois leaders believed that they had sold only the Shenandoah Valley to Virginia, the official deed gave Virginia much more land than that.\n\nNear the end of the conference, Canassatego gave the colonists some advice:\n\nCanassatego was concerned that the British colonies lacked a coordinated policy to deal with the military threat coming from New France. He made similar recommendations about colonial unity at another conference in 1745. His words became a central part of the Iroquois Influence Thesis, the controversial proposal that the Iroquois League was a model for the United States Constitution.\n\nCanassatego's final appearance at a treaty conference was in August 1749, one year after the end of King George's War. In Philadelphia, he complained that colonists were settling on Native land along the Susquehanna River. He agreed to sell this land to Pennsylvania, but once again, the written document ceded much more land than what had been agreed upon in negotiations.\n\nCanassatego was reportedly assassinated with poison in September 1750. There were several contemporary rumors about why he was killed. Some said that he was killed for taking bribes in exchange for selling lands. Another rumor maintained that he had been poisoned by agents of New France. Historian William Starna argued that Canassatego was probably assassinated by pro-French Iroquois who wanted to repudiate Canassatego's diplomatic ties with Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter his death, a fictional version of Canasatego appeared in the 1755 novel \"Lydia: or Filial Piety\", by English writer John Shebbeare. Following a literary convention where Native Americans were used to satirize Europeans, Canassatego was portrayed as wise and honest, in stark contrast to the scheming Englishmen he encounters.\n\nUSS \"Canassatego\" (YN-38/YNT-6/YTM-732), a medium harbor tug of the US Navy, was named for Canasatego.\n\n"}

It bears a similar relationship to computer science and engineering as mathematical logic bears to mathematics and as philosophical logic bears to philosophy. It is synonymous with \"logic in computer science\".\n\nThe term “Computational Logic” came to prominence with the founding of the ACM Transactions on Computational Logic. However, the term was apparently introduced by J.A. Robinson in a 1970 paper in the Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Machine Intelligence Workshop, Edinburgh, 1970, entitled \"Computational Logic: The Unification Computation\" (Machine Intelligence 6:63-72, Edinburgh University Press, 1971). The expression is used in the second paragraph with a footnote claiming that *computational logic* (the emphasis is in the paper) is \"surely a better phrase than 'theorem proving', for the branch of artificial intelligence which deals with how to make machines do deduction efficiently\". This sounds like coining the term; no reference to a previous use is mentioned. In 1972 the Metamathematics Unit at the University of Edinburgh was renamed “The Department of Computational Logic” in the School of Artificial Intelligence. The term was then used by Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore, who worked in the Department in the early 1970s, to describe their work on program verification and automated reasoning. They also founded a company Computational Logic Inc. of the same name.\n\nThe term “Computational Logic” has also come to be associated with logic programming, because much of the early work in logic programming in the early 1970s also took place in the Department of Computational Logic in Edinburgh. It was reused in the early 1990s to describe work on extensions of logic programming in the EU Basic Research Project “Compulog” and in the associated Network of Excellence. Krzysztof Apt, who was the co-ordinator of the Basic Research Project Compulog-II, reused and generalized the term when he founded the ACM Transactions on Computational Logic in 2000 and became its first Editor-in-Chief.\n\n"}

Born in New London, Connecticut, Hempstead was the delegate in the U.S. House for the Missouri Territory from 1812 to 1814. He served as territorial attorney general in Upper Louisiana and in the Missouri Territorial Legislature.\n\nHempstead was raised in Hebron, Connecticut, where he studied under Rev. Amos Basset. He studied law under Sylvester Gilbert when he was eighteen and was licensed in 1801. He practiced for a year in Middlesex, Connecticut, then two years in Newport, Rhode Island, then was admitted to the bar. He moved to Vincennes, Indiana Territory, in 1804. There, he befriended William Henry Harrison, and assisted with Harrison's government of the District of Louisiana. When Harrison was replaced with James Wilkinson, Hempstead resigned and moved to St. Louis. Hempstead later served with other Governors of the Louisiana and Missouri Territory, including attorney general.\n\nIn 1812, the Territory of Missouri (renamed to avoid confusion with Louisiana) became entitled to a delegate to Congress. Hempstead was elected and served a two-year term, declining re-election. He returned to private law practice. Hempstead alter served in the Missouri Territory General Assembly, rising to Speaker of the House.\n\nHempstead died at his home outside of St. Louis, Missouri on August 10, 1817, six days after an accident in which he was thrown from his horse. He was buried on his farm, on a plot which later became part of Bellefontaine Cemetery. Hempstead's grave is thus among the oldest in the entire cemetery. Hempstead County, Arkansas, is named in his honor.\n\nHempstead was friends with Thomas Hart Benton. Benton later said that he thought Hempstead would have become Missouri's first senator, had he lived long enough. Benton was with Hempstead when he died and spent the wake with his body. When Benton came home from the wake Benton received a challenge to a duel with Charles Lucas following a dispute over a court case. Benton replied that he would meet Lucas as soon as Hempstead was buried. The two went on to fight two duels, with Benton ultimately killing Lucas.\n\n"}

She was buried alive and murdered in Trinidad by activist Michael X and members of his Black Power group.\n\nBenson was born in London to Leonard and Ann Plugge. Gale had two brothers, Leonard Frank (born 1937), and Greville, her twin. She attended school at the Lycée Français in London. Later she started modelling, and worked as a DJ for a French radio show.\n\nShe married film director Jonathan Benson at the age of 20, but the marriage had difficulties and she moved away to Argentina when she was 22, in 1967. Returning to the United Kingdom she started a relationship with Black Power activist Hakim Jamal, an associate of Michael X. Jamal was an American from Boston whose previous name was Allen Donaldson. She changed her name to \"Hale Kimga\", an anagram of her first name and Hakim.\n\nBenson and Jamal moved to Guyana in 1971, before moving later that year to the commune of Michael X in Trinidad, who had fled the UK while bailed on charges of extortion and robbery.\n\nOn the morning of 2 January 1972, a group of men including Michael X took Benson out for a walk outside the commune. Arriving at a hole in the ground, they started digging until it was about four feet deep. One of the men turned to Benson and asked, \"What do you think this is for?\" She shrugged, and the man replied, \"This is a fresh hole for decomposed bodies\". They pushed her in, two of the men attacking her with a cutlass, badly wounding Benson in the chest and throat. She was buried alive, some of the men jumping on the soil to keep her down until she succumbed. The postmortem later found inhaled dirt in her lungs. It was alleged that Michael X had ordered her death because she was causing \"mental strain\" to Jamal.\n\nHer badly decomposed body was found seven weeks later, and eventually two of the men were convicted of her murder, after one of the group turned witness for the prosecution. Stanley Abbott and Edward Chadee were sentenced to death, but one was commuted to life imprisonment. Another of the group drowned at sea, and barber Joseph Skerritt was murdered. Michael X was charged with Benson's murder but never tried; he was sentenced to death for the murder of Skerritt on 21 August 1972, and hanged in Port of Spain's Royal Gaol in May 1975. Her lover Hakim Jamal was murdered in the United States in 1973, just over a year after Benson.\n\nThe movie \"The Bank Job\" (2008) portrays Michael X as having been in possession of indecent photographs of Princess Margaret stored in a bank vault, and using them to blackmail the British establishment. Hattie Morahan plays Benson, who the movie portrays as a spy whose role is to find any additional photos or negatives Michael X may have. Her brother Frank, however, said the idea Benson was a spy in real life was \"ludicrous\".\n\nBenson is a central character in Diana Athill's memoir of her friendship with Gale's lover, Hakim Jamal, \"Make Believe: A True Story\".\n"}

In an attempt to prove to a group of prospective articling students that the glass windows of the Toronto-Dominion Centre were unbreakable, Hoy threw himself at a glass wall on the 24th storey and fell to his death after the window frame gave way.\n\nGarry Hoy was a respected corporate and securities law specialist in Toronto. He had also completed an engineering degree before studying law.\n\nWhile giving a tour of the Toronto-Dominion Centre to a group of articling students, Hoy attempted to demonstrate the strength of the structure's window glass by slamming himself into a window. He had apparently performed this stunt many times in the past, having previously bounced harmlessly off the glass. However, in this instance the force of Hoy slamming into the window forced the window from its frame, causing the intact window and Hoy to fall from the building. The event occurred in a small conference room adjacent to a boardroom where a reception was being held for new articling students.\n\nStructural engineer Bob Greer was quoted by the \"Toronto Star\" as saying \"I don’t know of any building code in the world that would allow a 160-pound (72.5 kg) man to run up against a glass and withstand it.\"\n\nIn another interview, the firm's spokesman mentioned that the glass in fact did not break, but popped out of its frame, leading to Hoy's fatal plunge.\n\nHoy's death contributed to the closing of Holden Day Wilson in 1996, at the time the largest law firm closure in Canada.\n\nHoy's experience was recreated by \"MythBusters\" in the episode \"Vacuum Toilet, Biscuit Bazooka, Leaping Lawyer\", and was featured in numerous other television shows, often with some details changed.\n\nFor his unusual death, Hoy was recognized with a Darwin Award in 1996. His unusual death was also re-enacted by Joseph Fiennes in the 2006 movie \"The Darwin Awards\".\n\nThe incident is also recounted in Philip Slayton's \"Bay Street: A Novel\".\n\nThis unusual way to die was recreated in the third episode of the first season of the television series \"1000 Ways to Die\".\nAlso recreated on the Television show \"Curious And Unusual Deaths\" on Discovery Investigation channel.\n"}

Markham Cook Ltd. \"Bedfordshire\" was long, with a beam.\n\nThe Admiralty acquired \"Bedfordshire\" for anti-submarine duty in August 1939. Converted for service as a naval trawler, she was armed with a 4-inch gun, machine guns, and depth charges.\n\nFollowing completion of her conversion in December 1940, HMT \"Bedfordshire\" undertook anti-submarine patrols and escort duty off the southwest coast of England and in the Bristol Channel. She served in this capacity throughout 1941 and early 1942.\n\nAfter Germany declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, German U-boats quickly became a deadly threat on the East Coast. The United States Navy was ill-prepared to defend against submarine warfare, and U-boats found it easy to pick off commercial shipping vessels, which traveled unescorted. The onslaught began with Operation Drumbeat when 35 Allied ships were sunk by U-boats off the American coast in January 1942.\n\nIn March 1942, the Royal Navy sent 24 converted trawlers, including \"Bedfordshire\", to assist the United States Navy with anti-submarine patrols along the East Coast. \"Bedfordshire\", commanded by Lieutenant Russell Bransby Davis, RNR, was assigned to the Fifth Naval District, headquartered at Naval Station Norfolk. She operated out of Morehead City, North Carolina, primarily in sectors two and three, where she patrolled the waters surrounding the Outer Banks while U-boats continued to terrorize local shipping.\n\nOn 16 April 1942, \"Bedfordshire\" along with HMT \"Lady Elsa\", , and conducted patrols in sector two. \"Bedfordshire\" and \"Tourmaline\" assisted in the search for survivors of a sunken tanker in sector two on 17 April.\n\nOn 18 April, \"Bedfordshire\" searched for survivors of , the first U-boat sunk by the US Navy off the East Coast. For the next several days \"Bedfordshire\" stood guard duty over a concerted attempt to salvage \"U-85\". The effort was ultimately unsuccessful and the attempt was abandoned on 22 April. The remains of \"U-85\" lie at a depth of less than 100 feet (30 m) in the waters off Bodie Island Lighthouse; its Enigma machine was recovered in 2001.\n\nThe remainder of April was spent patrolling in the vicinity of Currituck Island, Hatteras Island, and Lookout Shoals.\n\nOn 1 May, a plane reported having spotted a lifeboat some east of Cape Lookout, and \"Bedfordshire\" was sent on a search and rescue mission. She was back on patrol in sector three from 7–9 May, after which she returned to Morehead City.\n\nAt noon on 10 May \"Bedfordshire\" and HMT \"St Zeno\" departed Morehead City to escort a convoy to Hatteras, arriving safely near midnight.\n\nOn 10 May 1942, \"Bedfordshire\" and HMT \"St Loman\" were dispatched from Morehead City to search for a U-boat believed to be in the vicinity of Ocracoke Island. The ships were spotted by , commanded by \"Kapitänleutnant\" Günther Krech. Later in the evening Krech, believing his sub had been detected, fired on \"St Loman\", which spotted the torpedoes and evaded them. The search continued throughout the night. At 05:40 on 11 May 1942, \"U-558\" fired a torpedo at \"Bedfordshire\", missed, and fired a second, which scored a direct hit and sank her immediately. All 37 men aboard were killed. A 38th crewman, a young stoker named Sam Nutt, had been detained at Morehead City by local police and narrowly missed boarding the ship for her last patrol.\nOn 14 May, the bodies of two seamen were discovered by a Coast Guardsman on the shores of Ocracoke Island. Their British uniforms offered the first indication that \"Bedfordshire\" may have met her end, and the U-boat menace was presumed to be responsible. Her fate was confirmed the following year after \"U-558\" was sunk, resulting in the capture of Kapitänleutnant Krech and his ship's diaries.\n\nThe bodies found on 14 May were identified as belonging to Sub-Lieutenant Thomas Cunningham and Ordinary Telegraphist Stanley Craig of the \"Bedfordshire\". They were buried in a small plot next to a cemetery in Ocracoke Village. The Royal Navy flag draped over Cunningham's coffin was one of several that he himself had given to a local man less than a month earlier for the funeral ceremonies of British seamen. Shortly thereafter, two additional bodies from the ship washed ashore on Ocracoke. Unidentified, they were also buried in what became known as the Ocracoke Island British Cemetery.\n\nOn nearby Hatteras Island, the body of a fifth British seaman, unidentifiable but presumed to be from \"Bedfordshire\", washed ashore on 21 May. The month prior, the body of another British sailor from the sunken merchant ship \"San Delfino\" had been buried on Hatteras; the \"Bedfordshire\" sailor's body was interred in an adjacent plot, resulting in a second British Cemetery, formally known as Cape Hatteras Coast Guard Burial Ground.\n\nIn late May or early June, a sixth body, belonging to Seaman Alfred Dryden, washed ashore at Swan Quarter, North Carolina. It was buried in Oak Grove Baptist Cemetery at Creeds, Virginia, with three of the dead from HMT \"Kingston Ceylonite\", sunk by a mine on 15 June 1942, whose bodies washed ashore nearby.\n\nThe British Cemeteries on Ocracoke and Hatteras were leased in 1976 in perpetuity to the British government for as long as the interred bodies remain there. Formal custody is handled by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which provides the protocol headstones. Regular maintenance is handled by the US Coast Guard and local residents as a gesture of gratitude and respect to the fallen men and an act of comity to the British government. A Royal Navy flag flies over the cemeteries, and a ceremony is held there each year on 11 May to honor the men of the \"Bedfordshire\". The Commonwealth War Graves Commission also provided headstones for the four British servicemen interred in Creeds, Virginia, including Alfred Dryden of the \"Bedfordshire\".\n\nThe crewmen whose bodies were not recovered are honored by name on the Royal Naval Patrol Service Memorial at Lowestoft.\n\nThe wreck of the \"Bedfordshire\" was located in 1980 at at a depth of . The site is considered a protected war grave under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. In 2008 and 2009 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration led an expedition to document the condition of ships sunk during the Battle of the Atlantic. At the request of the British government, the \"Bedfordshire\" wreck site was surveyed by the expedition in 2009.\n\nOn 31 July 2015, the \"Bedfordshire\" was listed in the US government's National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n\n"}

The cells can therefore be grown for prolonged periods \"in vitro\". The mutations required for immortality can occur naturally or be intentionally induced for experimental purposes. Immortal cell lines are a very important tool for research into the biochemistry and cell biology of multicellular organisms. Immortalised cell lines have also found uses in biotechnology.\n\nAn immortalized cell line should not be confused with stem cells, which can also divide indefinitely, but form a normal part of the development of a multicellular organism.\n\nThere are various immortal cell lines. Some of them are normal cell lines (e.g. derived from stem cells). Other immortalised cell lines are the \"in vitro\" equivalent of cancerous cells. Cancer occurs when a somatic cell which normally cannot divide undergoes mutations which cause de-regulation of the normal cell cycle controls leading to uncontrolled proliferation. Immortalised cell lines have undergone similar mutations allowing a cell type which would normally not be able to divide to be proliferated \"in vitro\". The origins of some immortal cell lines, for example HeLa human cells, are from naturally occurring cancers.\n\nImmortalized cell lines are widely used as a simple model for more complex biological systems, for example for the analysis of the biochemistry and cell biology of mammalian (including human) cells. The main advantage of using an immortal cell line for research is its immortality; the cells can be grown indefinitely in culture. This simplifies analysis of the biology of cells which may otherwise have a limited lifetime.\n\nImmortalized cell lines can also be cloned giving rise to a clonal population which can, in turn, be propagated indefinitely. This allows an analysis to be repeated many times on genetically identical cells, which is desirable for repeatable scientific experiments. The alternative, performing an analysis on primary cells from multiple tissue donors, does not have this advantage.\n\nImmortalized cell lines find use in biotechnology, where they are a cost-effective way of growing cells similar to those found in a multicellular organism \"in vitro\". The cells are used for a wide variety of purposes, from testing toxicity of compounds or drugs to production of eukaryotic proteins.\n\nWhile immortalized cell lines often originate from a well-known tissue type, they have undergone significant mutations to become immortal. This can alter the biology of the cell and must be taken into consideration in any analysis. Further, cell lines can change genetically over multiple passages, leading to phenotypic differences among isolates and potentially different experimental results depending on when and with what strain isolate an experiment is conducted.\n\nMany cell lines that are widely used for biomedical research have been contaminated and overgrown by other, more aggressive cells. For example, supposed thyroid lines were actually melanoma cells, supposed prostate tissue was actually bladder cancer, and supposed normal uterine cultures were actually breast cancer.\n\nThere are several methods for generating immortalized cell lines:\n\nThere are several examples of immortalized cell lines, each with different properties. Most immortalized cell lines are classified by the cell type they originated from or are most similar to biologically.\n\n\n"}

Her niece of the same name was similarly employed.\n\nKatherine was the daughter of Patrick Bellenden a servant of Margaret Tudor and Mariota Douglas, who was the nurse of James V. Her older brother was the Justice Clerk Thomas Bellenden of Auchnoule, another brother was the priest, poet, and translator John Bellenden.\n\nKatherine married Adam Hopper (d.1529) in 1527 receiving a royal gift of £300 as a dowry or \"tochter\" in thanks for her mother's service, then Francis Bothwell, who were both merchants and Provosts of Edinburgh. In 1529 Adam and Francis were business partners exporting fish to England. Her third husband was Oliver Sinclair, the King's favourite, who was reputed to have caused the Scottish defeat at the battle of Solway Moss.\n\nWhile Katherine worked in the royal wardrobe she bought cambric cloth, Holland cloth, and other materials for making the King's shirts, which she and her colleague Janet Douglas, the King's seamstress, embroidered with gold and silver thread. She sold cloth to the King's tailor, Thomas Arthur, and kept accounts of the King's purse. Janet Douglas, like Katherine, married a prominent courtier, David Lindsay of the Mount a diplomat and poet.\n\nIn July 1537 Katherine, described as \"Master Francis Bothuilis wyfe\" delivered 10 ells of purple velvet for use at the funeral of the Queen, Madeleine of Valois. Amongst the many payments to \"Katherine Bellenden\" in the Scottish treasurer's accounts one entry notes Katherine as the spouse of Robert Craig, a servant of the tailor Thomas Arthur. This was Katherine's namesake niece, daughter of Thomas Bellenden of Auchnoule, married to Robert Craig, later an Edinburgh merchant, and their children included John Craig the physician and perhaps the lawyer Sir Thomas Craig. It seems that both Katherines were employed in the royal wardrobe and dealt in luxury fabrics.\n\nJames V paid Katherine £666-13s-4d in April 1538, this was for 1000 marks which she had lent to the King's mother, Margaret Tudor. In 1541, Oliver and Katherine with their kinsfolk and their royal wardrobe colleagues, John Tennent and his wife the royal laundress, Mause Acheson, made a contract 'mortifyng' property, including the rents of part of a property on Edinburgh's Netherbow to the west of Moubray House for priests to say Mass for their souls in St Giles, Edinburgh.\n\nIn November 1543, Katherine wrote to the Queen Dowager of Scotland, Mary of Guise, regarding her and her husband's debts. A ship they had invested in had been impounded for sums of money they owed for lands in Orkney and Shetland. Mary of Guise was giving their Orkney lands to George Gordon, Earl of Huntly. In Orkney, Oliver Sinclair held the castle of Kirkwall as his ancestors had done, and Katherine wrote, 'we think great lack to go from our native rooms which my husband and his surname have held these three or four hundred years.'\n\nKatherine and Adam Hopper had a son, Richard, who was eldest and heir to Adam Hopper after he died in 1530. Francis Bothwell was the father of Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney, though it is unclear if Katherine was his mother.\n\nKatherine had two daughters with Oliver Sinclair. Isobel Sinclair married James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh who assassinated Regent Moray in 1570. Alison Sinclair married David Hamilton of Monktonmains, brother of Bothwellhaugh. The persons of Isobel Sinclair and her supposed cousin Anne Bothwell are conflated in the Scottish ballad, \"Lady Anne Bothwell's Lament\". Anne Bothwell was the daughter of Adam Bothwell the bishop, and perhaps granddaughter of Katherine Bellenden. The ballad relates to her seduction and abandonment by Alexander Erskine (d.1640), a son of the Earl of Mar\n\n"}

Prior to becoming an actor, he had a successful career as a professional wrestler as well as an enforcer for the Colombo family.\n\nHe was born in Brooklyn, New York City in 1926 of Italian-American heritage. He was fluent in both English and Italian. His wrestling career began in neighboring New Jersey in 1953. He wrestled under the Zebra Kid gimmick, and was billed at the height of 6 foot 6 inches. It wasn't long before Montana found success. Along with Golden Terror, he won the New Jersey Tag Team titles on April 4, 1953. Lenny began to travel on the road, wrestling in the Midwest. He soon won the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship, defeating Dave Sims on October 1, 1953 in Kansas City. However he lost the title on December 11, 1953 to Sonny Myers, who had held the title a previous three times before defeating the Zebra Kid. His final success of the 1950s came in 1956, winning the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship with Gene Kiniski, defeating Herb Freeman and Ray Gunkel on September 18 in Dallas under the alias Len Crosby. He also worked as a bouncer during this time to earn extra money.\n\nBy the late 1950s, Montana was on the road with the Carnival Circuit as a wrestler. As a popular wrestler within the circuit, Montana met the then unknown Eddie Sharkey in 1960. The two struck up a friendship. After seeing what Sharkey could do, Montana recommended that he try his hand at professional wrestling. Montana also clued in Sharkey on the then-unacknowledged truth about professional wrestling, that all the outcomes are predetermined. Later on in that year, Montana won the NWA Texas World Tag Team titles with Joe Christie, under the Len Crosby name. Then with Hard Boiled Haggerty, he won the AWA World Tag Team Championship on October 4, 1960, defeating Stan Kowalski and Tiny Mills ( wrestling as Murder Inc.) in Minneapolis. But in a match against Verne Gagne, Montana suffered a broken leg, forcing Haggerty to choose a new partner. After recovering from his injury, in 1961 Montana began to wrestle in Florida. He came to the Tampa Bay area and began to wrestle under The Zebra Kid alias. At his great size, he would often pin his opponents in under one minute. The Zebra Kid had a notable feud with Eddie Graham; their battles sold out Fort Homer Hesterly Armory many Tuesday nights in 1961. Things came to a head when Montana defeated Eddie Graham in a NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (Georgia version) title match on May 1, 1962. On November 23, 1962, he won the NWA (Georgia) Southern Tag Team Titles with his partner Gypsy Joe, defeating 'Grizzly' Jake Smith and Luke Brown. Montana then went on to form a powerful partnership with Tarzan Tyler, in which they would win three titles. First, the NWA International Tag Team Titles on April 9, 1963 defeating Ted Evans and Chief Little Eagle, then again winning the NWA International Tag Team Titles later in June 1963, defeating billed champions Chief Little Eagle and Dick Steinborn. Finally, the duo won the NWA World Tag Team Championship in Georgia, during October 1963, they defeated Karl Von Brauner and Kurt Von Brauner. Montana was due to be Gorilla Monsoon's tag team partner in 1964, but it never happened due to Monsoon becoming partners with The African Savage at the last minute. Lenny had been interested in acting, and was meeting with casting agents in Los Angeles at the same time he was due to team up with Bison. Montana began to wrestle less and less, and went into semi-retirement; however he appeared in matches up until his acting career took off in the early 1970s.\n\nMontana became involved with the Colombo crime family in the late 1960s. Tall and very heavily built, his talents were mostly as an enforcer and an arsonist. He would tie a tampon to the tail of a mouse, dip it in kerosene, light it, and let the mouse run through a building, or he would put a candle in front of a cuckoo clock so that when the clock's bird would pop out the candle would be knocked over and start a fire. Eventually, Montana ended up doing time in Riker's Island. Upon being released, as a friend of the family, Montana would act as a bodyguard for many of the senior members of the Colombo Family.\n\nThe filming of the classic movie \"The Godfather\" faced strong opposition from the Italian-American Civil Rights League, with disputes headed by Joe Colombo and Frank Sinatra, threatening its whole production. Producer Al Ruddy eventually made a deal with the league and Joe Colombo to cut the word Mafia from the script, and the league were behind the production of the film. This meant many mobsters would be present on the set of \"The Godfather\". It was in 1971, when Montana was acting as a bodyguard for a senior Colombo Family member, that he met Francis Ford Coppola and Al Ruddy. After being introduced to the 6-foot-6, 320-pound Montana, they quickly cast him for the role of Luca Brasi. When Bettye McCartt, Al Ruddy's assistant, broke her watch, Montana offered to get her a new one. A week later, Montana returned with a \"gift from the boys\" – an antique diamond watch. He was picked for the part after the original actor playing the character died of a stroke. This would be his first film appearance. His role was that of sadistic mob enforcer Luca Brasi, a hitman used by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). Montana was so nervous about appearing opposite Brando that he kept practicing his lines over and over again. Francis Ford Coppola rewrote the scene to feature this. Montana also suffered an attack of nerves during the scene where his character thanked the Don; Coppola also wrote this into the script as Brasi being overwhelmed by the Don's invitation to his daughter's wedding. He had little screen time in the role of Luca Brasi, but his notable height and physique caught the eye of producers, and he appeared in several movies and television programs after appearing in \"The Godfather\".\n\nAfter appearing in \"The Godfather\", Montana was an actor in demand. One of the first of these roles was the Italian spoof film \"The Funny Face of the Godfather\" in 1973. Montana had the role of Saro, and an artist's rendition of Montana appeared on the film's poster. He established himself as an efficient character actor and appeared in \"Patty\" (1976), \"Fingers\" (1978) as the pizzeria owner Luchino, \"Matilda\" (1978), \"They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way\" (1978), \"The Jerk\" (1979), \"Seven\" (1979), \"Below the Belt\" (1980), \"Defiance\" (1980), \"Battle Creek Brawl\" (1980) alongside Jackie Chan, \"Evilspeak\" (1981), \"...All the Marbles\" (1981), \"Pandemonium\" (1982) and \"Blood Song\" (1982). He also acted on television as well as the big screen, appearing in \"Search\" (1973), \"Strike Force\" (1975), which starred a young Richard Gere, \"Contract on Cherry Street\" (1977), which featured Frank Sinatra, \"Kojak\" (1978), and \"Magnum, P.I.\" (1982). Montana was usually cast as \"muscle\" for hire or an intimidating mobster.\n\nMontana retired from acting after appearing in the B movie \"Blood Song\" (1982), which he also co-wrote. He died May 12, 1992 of a heart attack in Lindenhurst, New York. He was 66 years old. His likeness was used as his character Luca Brasi in \"The Godfather Game\". Terence McGovern provided the voice acting. Montana was survived by his wife Sylvia, four children and twelve grandchildren.\n\n"}

Another, Neil Armstrong, became a NASA astronaut in 1962 and became the first person to walk on the Moon in 1969.\n\nMISS would have used a Thor booster, then later an Atlas, to launch a single-man spacecraft into orbit.

{"id": "1236650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1236650", "title": "Mechagodzilla", "text": "Mechagodzilla\n\nMechagodzilla was conceived in 1974 as a more serious villain than its immediate two predecessors, Gigan and Megalon, whose films were considered creative disasters. According to Tomoyuki Tanaka, Mechagodzilla was inspired by both Mechani-Kong from the previous Toho film \"King Kong Escapes\" and the robot anime genre, which was popular at the time. Effects director Teruyoshi Nakano also felt that a mechanical monster was cheaper to construct than the mutated animals Godzilla had previously faced. As the resulting \"Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla\" proved to be a greater critical success than previous 1970s \"Godzilla\" films, the character was revived in 1975's \"Terror of Mechagodzilla\". The film's screenplay was based on the winning entry of a story-writing competition won by Yukiko Takayama, who continued the darker tone of the previous film by adding the subplot of Mechagodzilla being cybernetically connected to a young woman. Mechagodzilla's design remained largely unchanged from its previous appearance, though it was made to look thinner and more angular, with a darker sheen and an MG2 insignia emblazoned on its upper arms. The film's original draft was going to have Mechagodzilla destroy Tokyo utterly, though the destruction was cut down for budgetary reasons.\nMechagodzilla was brought back in 1993's \"Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II\", as the success of \"Godzilla vs. Mothra\" and the popularity of its main antagonist Mothra spurred Toho into reintroducing familiar characters rather than inventing new ones. Originally, the new Mechagodzilla was to be named \"Berserk\", and was envisioned as being a much more organic Godzilla-like creature which would later turn on its creators after becoming infected with a computer virus which makes it self-aware. Berserk would subsequently absorb more and more machinery, to the point of degenerating into a mass of metal and wires, though this concept was rejected early in pre-production. As Mechagodzilla was intended to be a military defense weapon rather than an alien construct, the character was redesigned as looking sleeker and smoother. It was portrayed by suit actor Wataru Fukuda, and consisted of multiple separate elements which were worn like plate armor. Special effects artist Koichi Kawakita originally envisioned Mechagodzilla being able to split into aerial and terrestrial units, though this idea was scrapped in favor of the character merging with the flying battleship Garuda. The film was promoted through the children's program \"Adventure Godzilla-land\", which portrayed Godzilla and Mechagodzilla as rival news anchors reporting on the events of the upcoming movie. Composer Akira Ifukube wrote a theme for Mechagodzilla incorporating a slow battle march with heavy percussion and pentatonic phrasing.\n\nThe decision to incorporate Mechagodzilla into the Millennium series was taken by producer Shōgo Tomiyama, who gave the general outline of what would become the story of \"Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla\" to \"Godzilla vs. Megaguirus\" director Masaaki Tezuka. Tezuka instructed his staff to research both cybernetics and DNA engineering in order to make the character scientifically plausible. Tezuka had initially wanted Mechagodzilla to be a much speedier robot than the one on film, envisioning it as becoming progressively agiler during its fight against Godzilla as the latter tore off its opponent's armaments. This incarnation of Mechagodzilla was deliberately shown being airlifted by carriers rather than flying directly into battle as the previous two incarnations had done, as Tezuka felt that it made little sense for Mechagodzilla to drain its energy in such a manner. Upon being asked why the Mechagodzilla suit wasn't painted with military camouflage colors, Tezuka answered that \"Mechagodzilla doesn't need to hide.\" Tezuka had originally intended to have both Godzilla and Mechagodzilla die at the end of the film, but was forced to change this on the insistence of Toho managers, who felt that such an ending was too dark for a New Year movie release.\n\nIn the 2003 sequel \"\", creature designer Shinichi Wakasa used the same mold to create a redesigned Mechagodzilla, which was meant to look more weathered than its predecessor. According to production designer Shinki Nishikawa, several other changes were made to the Mechagodzilla design's head, chest and arms in order to make the character look less heroic and more machine-like. The robot's back unit was reduced in size and flipped upside down, and the head was made smaller. As the previous design's shoulder cannons were considered uneven and unsophisticated-looking because of their rectangular shape, special effects director Eiichi Asada made them more pentagonal. As the character was supposed to rely more on its forearm cannons than in the previous film, Nishikawa made them larger and more powerful looking.\n\nIn \"Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla\", Mechagodzilla is created as a weapon of destruction by the alien Simians, who intend to conquer Earth before their own homeworld gets destroyed by an expanding black hole. First appearing in a pseudo-flesh outer covering and masquerading as the real Godzilla, Mechagodzilla attacks Japan and overpowers Godzilla's ally Anguirus. Godzilla appears and destroys the pseudo-flesh disguise, forcing Mechagodzilla to reveal itself in full. Their initial battle results in a tie, as Godzilla is severely wounded and Mechagodzilla is forced back into the Simian's base for repair. Mechagodzilla is deployed again but is overpowered through the combined efforts of Godzilla and King Caesar. Godzilla ultimately defeats Mechagodzilla by decapitating it and blowing its body apart.\n\nThe Simians return and rebuild Mechagodzilla in \"Terror of Mechagodzilla\". This time, it is further modified with living human brain cells and has its control circuitry integrated into the body of the human woman Katsura Mafune, who is a cyborg courtesy of the aliens. Mechagodzilla is teamed up with the dinosaur Titanosaurus, who is controlled by Katsura's crazed father. Although Mechagodzilla survives another decapitation during a battle against Godzilla, it is once more defeated after Katsura commits suicide, destroying the robot's controls and freezing it long enough for Godzilla to use its atomic heat ray on Mechagodzilla's headless body, causing it to explode.\nIn \"Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II\", Mechagodzilla is built as an anti-Godzilla weapon by the United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center using 23rd century technology reverse engineered from the remains of Mecha-King Ghidorah. Mechagodzilla overpowers Godzilla in Kyoto, but is rendered harmless by a voltage backsurge caused by Godzilla. Mechagodzilla is recovered and merged with the smaller airship Garuda to form . This combined mecha later fights both Fire Rodan and Godzilla. It proceeds to cripple Godzilla by destroying its secondary brain and mortally wounds Rodan. Rodan then sacrifices its energy to revive Godzilla, who then uses its new red spiral atomic breath to destroy the weakened Super-Mechagodzilla.\n\nIn \"Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla\", it is revealed that Mechagodzilla's remains were salvaged and used to construct Moguera.\nThe Millennium incarnation is featured in two films: \"Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla\" and \"\" and is referenced as , derived from Kikai ryu (Japanese for \"machine dragon\"). When a second Godzilla appears in 1999, the Japanese military create a Mechagodzilla codenamed Kiryu, built around the skeleton of the original Godzilla from 1954. During its first battle with Godzilla four years later in 2003, Kiryu's genetic memories of its 1954 incarnation are awakened, and it proceeds to attack Tokyo, free from the controls of its pilot until its power drains. During its second battle with Godzilla, Kiryu forces Godzilla to retreat after using its Absolute Zero Cannon.\n\nIn \"\", taking place one year later in 2004, Mothra's fairies warn Japan that Kiryu's creation is a violation of the natural order, and that Mothra would gladly take the cyborg's place in protecting Japan, should Kiryu be dismantled. The ultimatum is declined, as Kiryu was built partially to defend against a second attack from Mothra herself. Godzilla eventually appears, prompting Mothra and Kiryu to cooperate with each other. Kiryu momentarily is forced to fight Godzilla alone after Mothra is killed, but is later assisted by Mothra's larvae, who encase Godzilla in a cocoon, and Kiryu is given orders to terminate him. However, Kiryu's soul is awakened once again, and it instead submerges Godzilla and itself in the middle of the ocean (though not before ejecting its human occupant to safety).\n\nMechagodzilla appears briefly in \"\", the first film in the anime trilogy. The mech is designed as a countermeasure against Godzilla, but was never activated; humanity and their allies flee into outer space and abandon Mechagodzilla and their other countermeasures. Though not seen again, the mech is referenced several other times throughout the film. In \"\", the second film in the trilogy, the remnants of Mechagodzilla's AI rebuilt the facility it was created in by utilizing nanometal to help defeat Godzilla, aptly named \"Mechagodzilla City\". Haruo and his forces used the city as a based operation to destroy Godzilla.\n\nThe Showa Mechagodzilla stands 50 meters in height and weighs 40,000 metric tons. It is built from \"space titanium\", and is capable of launching missiles from its fingers, toes and knees, as well as firing energy beams from its eyes and chest unit. Its head can spin 360°, and can form a force field capable of repelling and shocking opponents. The upgraded model featured in \"Terror of Mechagodzilla\" included revolving missiles, and was no longer vulnerable to decapitation, as its main computer was housed in an external power source.\n\nThe Heisei Mechagodzilla stands 120 meters in height, weighs 150,000 metric tons, and is powered by a nuclear reactor, deriving its energy from heavy hydrogen and helium-3 in pellet form. Its frame is coated in an armor made of synthetic diamond codenamed T-1, allowing the robot to resist and repel Godzilla's atomic ray, as well as absorb its power to energize its \"Plasma Grenade\", an energy weapon housed in its abdomen. Additional armaments include a \"Laser Cannon\" and \"Mega Buster\" ray fired from the eyes and mouth respectively, and shock anchors capable of piercing Godzilla's hide and electrocuting him. The model is later combined with the flying battleship Garuda, thus allowing it to hover and adding two additional laser cannons to its arsenal.\n\nThe Millennium Mechagodzilla stands at 60 meters in height, weighs 40,000 metric tons, and is piloted remotely from a control craft, and can be remotely recharged from the ground using microwaves that are relayed through a power system on one of the command aircraft, and then beamed back down to the robot. Its armaments include an oral maser cannon, arm-mounted laser guns and a flight pack containing rocket launchers. Its deadliest, but most energetically costly weapon is the Absolute Zero cannon housed in its chest, which fires a beam capable of flash freezing enemies and disintegrating them. In \"\", the Absolute Zero Cannon is replaced with a \"Triple Hyper Maser Cannon\".\n\nThe Anime Trilogy Mechagodzilla stands 50 meters in height, weighs 30,000 metric tons, and is powered by artificial intelligence and made from nanometal. In the novel: \"Project Mechagodzilla\", its arsenal inclues Blade Launcher, Convergent Neutron Cannon, Flight, Hyper Lance, Thermal Energy Buffer Layer, and Tail Blow. When it form Mechagodzilla city, the defenses include gun cannons, EMP Harpoons, and a force field to protect itself when fire upon.\n\nThe character has generally been positively received. It was rated #15 of the 50 Best Movie Robots by \"The Times\", beating other such legends as C-3PO from \"Star Wars\", the T-1000 from \"\", and Optimus Prime from \"Transformers\". WatchMojo.com listed Mechagodzilla as #2 on their \"Top 10 Godzilla Villains\" list, \"Complex\" listed the character as #6 on its \"The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time\" list, while IGN listed it as #4 on their \"Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters\" list.\n\nThe various incarnations of Mechagodzilla has appeared in other media associated with the series, such as video games, television shows or comics. In the 5th-season episode of \"30 Rock\", \"Chain Reaction of Mental Anguish\", Kiryu appears as one of the characters in a theme restaurant.\n\nIn Ernest Cline's novel \"Ready Player One\" and its film adaptation, the main antagonist controls a full size Mechagodzilla replica during the climatic battle in a virtual reality environment. In the book, it is the Kiryu model that fights against Ultraman. In the movie, it is an original design that fights against the Iron Giant and the RX-78-2 Gundam.\n\nIn the game \"Bulletstorm\" there's a level where the player controls a mechanical version of a Hekaton (which is the game's equivalent to Godzilla) as well as the song being played during this part of the game being called \"Mecha-dzilla\"\n\nGodzilla and Mechagodzilla make a cameo appearance in \"Ugly Americans\" (Season 1: Episode 7 \"Kong of Queens\") in which King Kong fights Godzilla (King Kong's children watching the movie \"Godzilla vs. King Kong\") and another when Kong punches a wall (after an argument with Mark Lily on the phone), the Showa-era Mechagodzilla was seen having breakfast.\n\nMechagodzilla was parodied by the series \"South Park\" in their episode \"Mecha-Streisand\", which features singer Barbara Streisand becoming a gigantic mechanical monster. The episode also includes references to Mothra, Gamera, and Ultraman.\n\nThe Shōwa Mechagodzilla appears in the video games \"\" for the Nintendo Entertainment System, \"Godzilla\" for the Game Boy, \"Super Godzilla\" for the Super NES (American release; replaces the Heisei version from the Super Famicom release, since the Heisei incarnation's film had yet to be released in America when the game was released), \"\" for TurboGrafx-16, \"Godzilla Generations\" for the Dreamcast (erroneously using his Heisei counterpart's sound effects) and \"\" for the Dreamcast and the Wii version of \"\".\n\nThe Heisei Mechagodzilla appeared in the video games \"Super Godzilla\" (Japanese version, replaced by the Showa Mechagodzilla in the English release) and \"\", both for the Super NES, \"\" for Game Boy Advance, \"\" for Xbox and PlayStation 2, \"\" for Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube, and the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions of \"\".\n\nKiryu first appeared in the Japanese version of \"\" on the Nintendo GameCube. Since the Millennium Mechagodzilla duology would take a few years to reach US stores, it was dropped from the American version of the game but did appear as an exclusive in the Xbox version. Kiryu was next playable in \"\" for the Xbox and the PlayStation 2 under the title \"Mechagodzilla 3\"; this would be Kiryu's first PS2 appearance in the United States. Kiryu also appears in both versions of \"\", for the first time under the name \"Kiryu\" as opposed to its names in the two previous games; \"Millennium Mechagodzilla\" and \"Mechagodzilla 3\".\n\nLike the other kaiju in the game, the backstories of all three Mechagodzilla incarnations are altered slightly, to fit the context of the game. The Heisei Mechagodzilla and Kiryu are man-made mecha created by the G.D.F. (Global Defense Force) faction to defend Earth from the Vortaak and their kaiju of the Aliens faction. The original Showa Mechagodzilla was salvaged and rebuilt by the Vortaak to be used in their kaiju force.\n\nIn the PlayStation 4 version of \"Godzilla\", 4 incarnations of Mechagodzilla appear, the original Showa Mechagodzilla appears as both Mechagodzilla from \"Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla\" and as Mechagodzilla 2 the rebuilt Mechagodzilla from \"Terror of Mechagodzilla\". The Heisei Mechagodzilla appears in its Super Mechagodzilla form, while Kiryu appears in its rebuilt design from \"Tokyo S.O.S.\"\n\nIn the PS4 version, all 4 Mechagodzilla are playable, the 2 versions of the Showa Mechagodzilla can be played in God of Destruction Mode via the Invade option (which allows the mode to be played using Kaiju other than the Heisei era Godzilla), while Super Mechagodzilla and Kiryu can be played via selecting Defend option (where the player defends humanity as friendly kaiju such as Mothra and various G-Force Mecha). In the PS3 version, only Mechagodzilla 1975, Super Mechagodzilla, and Kiryu appear as bosses and are not playable.\n\nThe thirteenth level of \"City Shrouded in Shadow\", a game where players, as civilians, must escape and survive kaiju attacks, mostly mirrors the first encounter between Godzilla and Kiryu in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. The protagonists, tied up in the building by Yakuza thugs, witness Godzilla rampage through the game's setting, the fictional Ichi City, and Kiryu is eventually deployed in response. After a short battle where both shoot at each other, Godzilla roars at Kiryu, and reminds the spirit within of his past as a Godzilla, causing him to be possessed & go berserk. As Godzilla leaves, Kiryu approaches and fires missiles at the building in which the player is in. Once the player has reached safety or once 30 seconds have transpired, Kiryu marches through the building, cleaving it in half, heading off into the distance. The newspaper that displays the results after the level reveals that, after 30 minutes of rampaging, Kiryu has run out of power, allowing the government to retrieve the inactive mecha.\n\nWhile Mechagodzilla did not appear in \"\", a sequel to \"Godzilla\" (1998), the first Godzilla was reanimated as a cyborg called \"Cyber-Godzilla\" in the Monster Wars trilogy.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2220463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220463", "title": "Missing white woman syndrome", "text": "Missing white woman syndrome\n\nMissing white woman syndrome is a phenomenon noted by social scientists and media commentators of the extensive media coverage, especially in television, of missing person cases involving young, white, upper-middle-class women or girls. The phenomenon is defined as the Western media's undue focus on upper-middle-class white women who disappear, with the disproportionate degree of coverage they receive being compared to cases of missing women of color and missing men and women of lower social classes. Although the term was coined to describe disproportionate coverage of missing person cases, it is sometimes used to describe similar disparities in news coverage of other violent crimes. Instances have been cited in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa.\n\nPBS news anchor Gwen Ifill is said to be the originator of the phrase. Charlton McIlwain, a professor at New York University, defines the syndrome as white women perpetually occupying a privileged role as violent crime victims in news media reporting, and concludes that missing white woman syndrome functions as a type of racial hierarchy in the cultural imagery of the West. Professor Eduardo Bonilla-Silva categorizes the racial component of missing white woman syndrome as a form of racial grammar, through which white supremacy is normalized by implicit or even invisible standards.\n\nMissing white woman syndrome has led to a number of right-wing tough on crime measures that were named for white women who disappeared and were subsequently found harmed. Moody, Dorris and Blackwell (2008) concluded that in addition to race and class, factors such as supposed attractiveness, body size and youthfulness function as unfair criteria in the determination of newsworthiness in coverage of missing women. Also noteworthy was that news coverage of missing black women was more likely to focus on the victim's baggage, such as abusive boyfriends or a troubled past, while coverage of white women tends to focus on their roles as mothers or daughters.\n\nWith regard to missing children, statistical research which compares national media reports with FBI data shows that there is marked under-representation of African American children in media reports relative to non-African American children. A subsequent study found that girls from minority groups were the most under-represented in these missing-children news reports by a very large margin.\n\nZach Sommers, a sociologist at Northwestern University, noted that while there is a sizable body of research that shows that white people are more likely than people of color to appear in news coverage as victims of violent crime there is relatively little when it comes to missing persons cases. In 2013, Sommers cross-referenced the missing persons coverage of four national and local media outlets against the FBI's missing persons database. Sommers found black people received disproportionately less coverage than whites and men received disproportionately less coverage than women; Sommers could not directly assess the number of missing white women in the FBI files due to how the data was structured but concluded that there was circumstantial—although not statistically conclusive—evidence that white women received disproportionate coverage. In the same study, professor Eduardo Bonilla-Silva elucidated that the subtle standard of placing a premium on white lives in the news helps to maintain and reinforce a racial hierarchy with whites at the top. For example, black women are members of both a marginalized racial group and a marginalized gender group. Crucially, though, black women have an “intersectional experience [that] is greater than the sum of racism and sexism.” In other words, like white women, black women are subject to sexism, but the form of that sexism differs for black women because of the compounding effects of racial discrimination; with missing white woman syndrome being a pertinent manifestation of this social phenomenon. Sociologists note that the tone of media coverage for black female victims differs markedly from coverage of white female victims in that the former are more likely to be blamed for purportedly putting themselves in harm's way, either knowingly or unknowingly. Victim blaming in this context reinforces the notion that black female victims are not only less innocent, but also less worthy of rescue relative to white women. Other observers note the lack of publicity given to black female victims of police brutality in news coverage, attributing the silence to a tradition of “sexism and patriarchy” in American society.\n\nA report that aired on CNN noted the differences between the level of media coverage given to Caucasian women like Laci Peterson and Natalee Holloway, who disappeared in 2002 and 2005 respectively, and LaToyia Figueroa, a pregnant Black Hispanic woman. Figueroa disappeared in Philadelphia the same year Holloway disappeared. Figueroa and her unborn daughter were found murdered. The San Francisco Chronicle published an article detailing the disparity between the coverage of the Peterson case and that of Evelyn Hernandez, a Hispanic woman who was nine months pregnant when she disappeared in 2002.\n\nKym Pasqualini, president of the National Center for Missing Adults, observed that media outlets tend to focus on \"damsels in distress\" – typically, affluent young white women and teenagers.\n\nIn a 2016 \"Esquire\" article about the disappearance of Tiffany Whitton, journalist Tom Junod observed that women of lower social status such as Whitton, a 26-year-old unemployed drug addict who was on parole, do not get much media attention as \"media outlets are ruthlessly selective, and they tend to prefer women who are white, pretty, and, above all, innocent\". Whitton's mother stated that producers of shows like \"Nancy Grace\" told her they weren't interested in her daughter's case. Dr. Cory L. Armstrong wrote in the \"Washington Post\" that \"the pattern of choosing only young, white, middle-class women for the full damsel treatment says a lot about a nation that likes to believe it has consigned race and class to irrelevance\". \n\nAccording to a study published in \"The Law and Society Association\", aboriginal women who go missing in Canada receive 27 times less news coverage than white women; they also receive \"dispassionate and less-detailed, headlines, articles, and images.\"\n\nUniversity of Leicester Criminology Professor Yvonne Jewkes cites the murder of Milly Dowler, the murder of Sarah Payne, and the Soham murders as examples of \"eminently newsworthy stories\" about girls from \"respectable\" middle-class families and backgrounds whose parents used the news media effectively. She writes that, in contrast, the street murder of Damilola Taylor, a 10-year- old boy from Nigeria, initially received little news coverage, with reports initially concentrating upon street crime levels and community policing, and largely ignoring the victim. Even when Damilola's father flew into the UK from Nigeria to make press statements and television appearances, the level of public outcry did not, Jewkes asserts, reach \"the near hysterical outpourings of anger and sadness that accompanied the deaths of Sarah, Milly, Holly, and Jessica\".\n\nIn January 2006, London Police Commissioner Ian Blair described the media as institutionally racist. As an example, he had referred to the murder of two young girls in Soham in 2002. He said \"almost nobody\" understood why it became such a big story. Two cases of missing white girl syndrome that have been given as contrasting examples: the murder of Hannah Williams and the murder of Danielle Jones. It was suggested that Jones received more coverage than Williams because Jones was a middle-class schoolgirl, whilst Williams was from a working-class background with a stud in her nose and estranged parents.\n\nSandile Memela, chief director for social cohesion at South Africa's Department of Arts and Culture, noted amidst the Oscar Pistorius trial that there existed substantial differences between how media outlets reported on the murders of Reeva Steenkamp and Zanele Khumalo; two South African models, respectively white and black, who had been murdered by their boyfriends under nearly identical circumstances. Memela asserted that the discrepancy between the media coverage of the Steenkamp and Khumala murders amounted to \"structural racism\" within South African society, and stated: \"As a country we seem to have chosen to ignore the agony, pain and suffering of the Khumalo family for no other reason than that they are black.\"\n\nOn September 11, 2014, the South African news network SABC3 aired an investigative report which raised concerns around the “Missing White Woman Syndrome”; where the death of Steenkamp was juxtaposed with the death of Zanele Khumalo.\n\nSocial commentaries pointed to media bias in the coverage of soldier Jessica Lynch versus that of her fellow soldiers, Shoshana Johnson and Lori Piestewa. All three were ambushed in the same attack during the Iraq War on March 23, 2003, with Piestewa being killed and Lynch and Johnson being injured and taken prisoner. Lynch, a young, blonde, white woman, received far more media coverage than Johnson (a black woman and a single mother) and Piestewa (a Hopi from an impoverished background, and also a single mother), with media critics suggesting that the media gave more attention to the woman with whom audiences supposedly more readily identify.\nLynch herself leveled harsh criticism at this disproportionate coverage that focused only on her, stating in a congressional testimony before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform:\n\nIn October 2013, a girl estimated to be about 4 years of age was found in the custody of a Roma couple in Greece and was presumed to have been abducted. The story about the \"blonde angel\" and the search for her biological parents received international media coverage. A Romani rights activist commented on the case to say \"imagine if the situation were reversed and the children were brown and the parents were white\". The child was later identified as Maria Ruseva. Her biological mother was a Bulgarian Roma who gave Maria up for adoption.\n\nCritics have also cited excessive media coverage of murder trials where the defendant is female, white, young and attractive, and included them along with Missing White Woman Syndrome instances in an all-encompassing narrative nicknamed the \"woman in jeopardy\" or \"damsel in distress\" genre. In such cases, the media will focus on the accused, rather than the victim as in Missing White Woman Syndrome cases, and they will be more ambiguous about their guilt than in other criminal cases regardless of evidence. Cited examples include Amanda Knox, Jodi Arias and Casey Anthony.\n\nThe following missing person cases have been cited as instances of missing white woman syndrome; media commentators on the phenomenon regard them as garnering a disproportionate level of media coverage relative to contemporary cases involving missing girls or women of non-white ethnicities, and missing males of all ethnicities. The date of death or disappearance is given in parentheses.\n\nThe following missing person cases have been expressly compared to contemporary missing person cases labeled as examples of \"Missing White Woman Syndrome\", in order to hightlight differences in coverage between them. The date of death or disappearance is given in parentheses.\n\n\n\n"}

The UNESCO World Heritage Site Taj Mahal in Agra, often cited as one of the Wonders of the World, was commissioned to act as her final resting place.\n\nMumtaz Mahal was born Arjumand Banu Begum in Agra to a family of Persian nobility. She was the daughter of Abu'l-Hasan Asaf Khan, a wealthy Persian noble who held high office in the Mughal Empire, and the niece of Empress Nur Jahan, the chief wife of Emperor Jahangir and the power behind the emperor. She was married at the age of 19 on 30 April 1612 to Prince Khurram, later known by his regnal name Shah Jahan, who conferred upon her the title \"Mumtaz Mahal\". Although betrothed to Shah Jahan since 1607, she ultimately became his second wife in 1612. Mumtaz and her husband had fourteen children, including Jahanara Begum (Shah Jahan's favourite daughter), and the Crown prince Dara Shikoh, the heir-apparent, anointed by his father, who temporarily succeeded him, until deposed by Mumtaz Mahal's sixth child, Aurangzeb, who ultimately succeeded his father as the sixth Mughal emperor in 1658. The taj mahal (Mumtaz mahal's grave) was meant to be made out of black marble and on the other side of the river.\n\nMumtaz Mahal died in 1631 in Burhanpur, Deccan (present-day Madhya Pradesh), during the birth of her fourteenth child, a daughter named Gauhar Ara Begum. Shah Jahan had the Taj Mahal built as a tomb for her, which is considered to be a monument of \"undying love\". \n\nMumtaz Mahal (Original Name: Arjumand Banu Begum) was born on 27 April 1593 in Agra to Abu'l-Hasan Asaf Khan and his wife Diwanji Begum, the daughter of a Persian noble, Khwaja Ghias-ud-din of Qazvin. Asaf Khan was a wealthy Persian noble who held high office in the Mughal Empire. His family had come to India impoverished in 1577, when his father Mirza Ghias Beg (popularly known by his title of I'timad-ud-Daulah), was taken into the service of Emperor Akbar in Agra.\n\nAsaf Khan was also the older brother of Empress Nur Jahan, making Mumtaz a niece, and later, a step daughter-in-law of Nur Jahan, the chief consort of Emperor Jahangir, Shah Jahan's father. Her older sister, Parwar Khanum, married Sheikh Farid, the son of Nawab Qutubuddin Koka, the governor of Badaun, who was also the emperor Jahangir's foster brother. Mumtaz also had a brother, Shaista Khan, who served as the governor of various provinces in the empire during Shah Jahan's reign.\n\nMumtaz was remarkable in the field of learning and was a talented and cultured lady. She was well-versed in Arabic and Persian languages and could compose poems in the latter. She was reputed to have a combination of modesty and candor, a woman warmly straightforward yet bemusedly self-possessed. Early in adolescence, she attracted the attention of important nobles of the realm. Jahangir must have heard about her, since he readily consented to Shah Jahan's engagement with her.\n\nMumtaz Mahal was betrothed to Shah Jahan around 30 January 1607, when she was 14 years old at the time and he was 15. They were, however, married five years after the year of their betrothal on 30 April 1612 in Agra. The marriage was a real love-match. After their wedding celebrations, Shah Jahan, \"finding her in appearance and character elect among all the women of the time\", gave her the title \"Mumtaz Mahal\" Begum (\"the Exalted One of the Palace\"). During the intervening years between their betrothal and marriage, Shah Jahan had gotten married to his first wife, Princess Kandahari Begum in 1609 and in 1617, after marrying Mumtaz, took a third wife, Izz-un-Nissa Begum (titled Akbarabadi Mahal), the daughter of a prominent Mughal courtier. According to the official court historians, both the marriages were political alliances.\n\nBy all accounts, Shah Jahan was so taken with Mumtaz that he showed little interest in exercising his polygamous rights with his two other wives, other than dutifully siring a child with each. According to the official court chronicler, Motamid Khan, as recorded in his \"Iqbal Namah-e-Jahangiri\", the relationship with his other wives \"had nothing more than the status of marriage. The intimacy, deep affection, attention and favour which Shah Jahan had for Mumtaz exceeded what he felt for his other wives.\" Likewise, Shah Jahan's historian Inayat Khan commented that 'his whole delight was centered on this illustrious lady [Mumtaz], to such an extent that he did not feel towards the others [i.e. his other wives] one-thousandth part of the affection that he did for her.'\n\nMumtaz had a loving marriage with Shah Jahan. Even during her lifetime, poets would extol her beauty, grace, and compassion. Despite her frequent pregnancies, Mumtaz travelled with Shah Jahan's entourage throughout his earlier military campaigns and the subsequent rebellion against his father. She was his constant companion and trusted confidant, leading court historians to go to unheard lengths to document the intimate and erotic relationship the couple enjoyed. In their nineteen years of marriage, they had fourteen children together (eight sons and six daughters), seven of whom died at birth or at a very young age.\n\nUpon his accession to the throne in 1628, Shah Jahan designated Mumtaz as his chief empress with the title of 'Malika-i-Jahan' (\"Queen of the World\") and 'Malika-uz-Zamani' (\"Queen of the Age\"). Mumtaz's tenure as empress was brief (spanning a period of only three years due to her untimely death), nonetheless Shah Jahan bestowed her with luxuries that no other empress was given before her. For example, no other empress' residence was as decorated as Khas Mahal (part of Agra Fort), where Mumtaz lived with Shah Jahan. It was decorated with pure gold and precious stones and had rose water fountains of its own. Each wife of the Mughal emperor was given a regular monthly allowance for her \"gastos\" (housekeeping or travelling expenses). The highest allowance on record is the 10 lakh rupees per year given to Mumtaz Mahal by Shah Jahan.\n\nShah Jahan consulted Mumtaz in both private matters and the affairs of the state, and she served as his close confidant and trusted adviser. At her intercession, he forgave enemies or commuted death sentences. His trust in her was so great that he gave her the highest honour of the land — his imperial seal, the Mehr Uzaz, which validated imperial decrees. Mumtaz was portrayed as having no aspirations to political power, in contrast to her aunt, Empress Nur Jahan, the chief consort of Emperor Jahangir, who had wielded considerable influence in the previous reign.\n\nA great influence on him, often intervening on behalf of the poor and destitute, she also enjoyed watching elephant and combat fights performed for the court. Mumtaz also patronized a number of poets, scholars and other talented persons. A noted Sanskrit poet, Vansidhara Mishra, was the Empress' favourite. On the recommendation of her principal lady-in-waiting, Sati-un-Nissa, Mumtaz Mahal provided pensions and donations to the daughters of poor scholars, theologians, and pious men. It was quite common for women of noble birth to commission architecture in the Mughal Empire, so Mumtaz devoted some time to a riverside garden in Agra, which is now known as Zahara Bagh. It is the only architectural foundation which can be connected to her patronage.\n\nMumtaz Mahal died from postpartum hemorrhage in Burhanpur on 17 June 1631 while giving birth to her fourteenth child, after a prolonged labor of approximately 30 hours. She had been accompanying her husband while he was fighting a campaign in the Deccan Plateau. Her body was temporarily buried at Burhanpur in a walled pleasure garden known as Zainabad originally constructed by Shah Jahan's uncle Daniyal on the bank of the Tapti River. The contemporary court chroniclers paid an unusual amount of attention to Mumtaz Mahal's death and Shah Jahan's grief at her demise. In the immediate aftermath of his bereavement, the emperor was reportedly inconsolable. Apparently after her death, he went into secluded mourning for a year. When he appeared again, his hair had turned white, his back was bent, and his face worn. Mumtaz's eldest daughter, Jahanara Begum, gradually brought her father out of grief and took her mother's place at court.\n\nMahal's personal fortune (valued at ten million rupees) was divided by Shah Jahan between Jahanara Begum, who received half and the rest of her surviving children. Burhanpur was never intended by her husband as his wife's final resting spot. As a result, her body was disinterred in December 1631 and transported in a golden casket escorted by her son Shah Shuja and the deceased empress's head lady-in-waiting back to Agra. There it was interred in a small building on the banks of the Yamuna River. Shah Jahan stayed behind in Burhanpur to conclude the military campaign that had originally brought him to the region. While there, he began planning the design and construction of a suitable mausoleum and funerary garden in Agra for his wife. It was a task that would take 22 years to complete: the Taj Mahal.\n\nThe Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan to be built as a mausoleum for Mumtaz Mahal. It is seen as an embodiment of undying love and marital devotion. English poet Sir Edwin Arnold describes it as \"Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones.\" The beauty of the monument is also taken as a representation of Mumtaz Mahal's beauty and this association leads many to describe the Taj Mahal as feminine. Since Muslim tradition forbids elaborate decorations on graves, the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan are placed in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned to the right and towards Mecca.\n\nThe Ninety Nine Names of God are found as calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal in the crypt including, “O Noble, O Magnificent, O Majestic, O Unique, O Eternal, O Glorious…\". There are many theories about the origin of the name of this tomb and one of them suggests that 'Taj' is an abbreviation of the name Mumtaz. European travelers, such as François Bernier, who observed its construction, were among the first to call it the Taj Mahal. Since it is unlikely that they came up with the name, it is suggested that they might have picked it up from the locals of Agra who called the Empress 'Taj Mahal' and thought the tomb was named after her and the name began to be used interchangeably. However, there is no firm evidence to suggest this. Shah Jahan had not intended to entomb another person in the Taj Mahal; however, Aurangzeb had Shah Jahan buried next to the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal rather than build a separate tomb for his father. This is evident from the asymmetrical placement of Shah Jahan's grave on one side of his wife's grave which is in the centre.\n\nA crater was named in her honour on asteroid 433 Eros, along with another one after her husband.\n\n\n\n\n"}

April 6, 1981), previously known as Pima County Jane Doe, was a formerly unidentified American murder victim who was found on April 8, 1981. In late 2014, a photograph of a facial reconstruction of the victim was made public that led to Gerow's identification the next year. She was buried under a headstone with the placeholder name of \"Jane Doe\" with the phrase \"UNK - 1981\" Gerow's body remained unidentified for thirty-four years until it was announced that her remains had positively been identified.\n\nGerow, the oldest of her siblings, disappeared in July 1980 after leaving with John \"Jack\" Kalhauser, her boyfriend at the time. She had worked at a convenience store as well as a bartender at an establishment in Dracut, Massachusetts, often frequented by bikers. She remained in contact with family and had at one time called home stating she would be returning, yet she never did. Her family attempted to report her missing, yet local police declined to cooperate, due to the fact that she was an adult when she vanished.\n\nThe body of a white female was found in the desert on April 8, 1981 in Tucson, Pima County, Arizona, near Houghton Road and Interstate 10. Her remains were found by hunters driving in the desert who saw a jacket hanging from a tree and then looked through the area and discovered her body lying on the ground.\n\nThe victim was a young adult, between eighteen and twenty-two years of age. The autopsy determined she died one-and-a-half to two days before her body was discovered and cause of death was strangulation by ligature. She had been severely beaten in addition to being sexually assaulted. When found, her body was in an advanced state of decomposition rendering her facially unrecognizable and her eye color undetermined. The pathologist who examined her was able to determine she had a light skin complexion as well as long, light brown to blond hair. The victim also had a noticeable white spot on one of her upper front teeth. She was approximately five feet two to five feet three inches and weighed around 100 to 110 pounds at the time of her death. Additional evidence at the scene may have been blown away due to winds.\n\nHer body was clothed in denim jeans, white socks with pink pom poms, a white bra, blue underwear, brown suede shoes and unique blouse that was a dark blue and had \"puffy reddish-colored sleeves\" with a flower design. A denim jacket was found hanging in brush near the body.\n\nThe crime scene was photographed and law enforcement flew over the area to take further photographs and to find any additional clues. Body decomposition was not advanced enough to completely alter her fingerprints, which were eventually taken. Dental information was obtained along with, years later, her DNA. A DNA profile from another individual was extracted from her clothing in 2006, which allowed for a DNA profile of a potential suspect to be created after the sample analysis was completed in 2007. At the time the victim was found, authorities in Tucson were unable to obtain fingerprints. In an effort to obtain her fingerprints, the victim's hands were removed from the body and sent to the FBI. While the FBI had been successful in getting fingerprints from the victim, they were not a match to any missing persons on file or to anyone arrested for a crime. The case was compared to several missing person cases but all were ruled out.\n\nTo investigators, the style of some of her clothing suggested she could have been involved in the local county fair that had occurred at the time of her murder. Images of the victim's clothing have been featured on websites, National Center for Missing and Exploited Children posters, and in various news reports, in an effort to identify her. The victim had been walking or running through a wooded area before her death, as scratches on her body suggested.\n\nA \"crude\" sketch was created of the victim at the time initially following her discovery. It was released to the public on television and in the newspapers, yet the victim was not recognized by anyone in the area. After a 2012 exhumation of the body, the victim's face was digitally reconstructed after her skull was examined via a CT scan. The scan was sponsored by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in order to create an approximation of facial features and appearance when the victim was alive.\n\nDifferent theories regarding the life and demise of the victim existed. Investigators theorized she was a runaway as a child before she became an adult, had possibly been estranged from family, had been murdered elsewhere and dumped at a new scene, or had hitchhiked to Tucson from another location. Early into the investigation, it was theorized she could have been a victim of the then-unidentified Golden State Killer, who had moved south since his criminal career began in the mid 1970s.\n\nIn 1995, while \"building a case\" against Kalhauser for assault charges, a photograph of a young woman with light hair holding a bouquet was found in his possession. In late 2014, police announced that they believed the photograph was connected to the case of Pima County Jane Doe and quickly released it to the public. The woman in the photo was stated to resemble the victim's reconstruction and her physical description. The photograph is believed to have been taken between 1979 and 1981, also fitting the time frame in which Jane Doe was found. Kalhauser refused requests from the authorities to identify the woman in the photograph.\n\nThe then-unidentified woman's photograph was circulated to the public in late 2014 after authorities made the connection between it and the reconstruction. Authorities noted that the background scenery appeared to be from somewhere in the Eastern part of the country, most notably at a former camping area in Tyngsboro, Massachusetts. On December 23, 2014, her brother, Bill Gerow, Jr, received a notification from police that the female in the picture could be his sister. Gerow hadn't been seen since 1980 after she left the state voluntarily with Kalhauser, with whom she was in a relationship at the approximate age of 20 years. She had reportedly met her accused killer while at a nightclub. She had never explained the reason for her departure, although her family did believe she had \"run off.\" Her brother stated that she had called him around two to three weeks afterwards while residing in New Mexico. After this occasion, she was never heard from again, although her family continued efforts to locate her. The victim could not have officially been reported missing due to being over the age of 18 and that she had apparently left on her own accord.\n\nKalhauser has past ties to Arizona and is believed to have murdered his wife, Diane Van Reeth in 1995; he was living under an assumed name at the time of his wife's death. Van Reeth's body has never been found, yet he was later convicted in 1999. Other events in Kalhauser's criminal history includes being convicted for the 1974 murder of Paul Chapman and being indicted for the attempted murder of a man in 1979. Following his indictment for the 1979 case, Kalhauser jumped bail and fled after being released from jail. When he married Diane Van Reeth in Nevada, he used a false name to avoid being discovered. Kalhauser currently is serving twenty years in Massachusetts after his conviction of second-degree murder.\n\nOn September 28, 2015, information was released that the body of the unidentified victim was formally identified as Gerow in April 2015 and her body would be returned to family members. The identification was made through comparison of the family's DNA compared to that of the victim. Gerow's father, William Sr., stated he did not understand any possible motive for the death of his daughter. Kalhauser is considered a person of interest in the murder since the photograph was discovered and police have also asked for information regarding him as well as the victim during the two decades of her life. After the family received the remains of the victim, the body was cremated.\n\nIn 2017, Gerow's and Van Reeth's cases were featured on the second episode of \"Who Killed Jane Doe?\" on Investigation Discovery. Her brother and father provided interviews.\n\n"}

Their murders, which remain unsolved, were attributed to rumors of a Satanic cult in which they both were involved.\n\nThe case received national attention among the Satanic panic phenomenon of the 1980s, and was profiled in national media as well as on \"Unsolved Mysteries\".\n\nSally and Shane were both teenagers from San Angelo, Texas, who began dating in 1987 while in high school. After a prolonged breakup, they reunited on the evening of July 4, 1988, and made plans to watch the annual firework show at Lake Nasworthy. During their relationship, Sally's friends had witnessed her attending parties with occult activities and where black magic was being practiced; they alleged that she and Shane had been involved with a Satanic cult. In March 1988, Sally and Shane turned a gun over to local police, claiming that they had been given it by a member of the cult and told it had been used in a murder-robbery. Police searched its serial number, and discovered it had been reported stolen.\n\nOn the evening of July 4, 1988, Sally and Shane were seen alone on the shore of Lake Nasworthy before midnight by a fisherman offshore. On July 7, they both were reported as missing persons.\n\nOn November 11, 1988, Sally's remains were found off FM 584, roughly south of where they were last seen, near the Twin Buttes Reservoir's South Pool. Three days later, on November 14, Shane's remains were discovered in the vicinity. According to their autopsies, they had both died from shotgun blasts to the head. The case remains unsolved.\n\nIn June 2017 the Tom Green County Sheriff's Office in San Angelo pulled over a local man, John Cyrus Gilbreath, on suspicion of marijuana possession. A female passenger in his car told them Gilbreath was dealing, and on that basis they obtained a warrant to search his house.\n\nAmong the items they found in the house were what they described as writings, audio tapes and \"biological material\" that they said may be connected to the McNelly and Stewart homicides. They announced Gilbreath is now considered a person of interest in that case.\n\n"}
{"id": "29803004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29803004", "title": "Neurostimulation", "text": "Neurostimulation\n\nNeurostimulation is the purposeful modulation of the nervous system's activity using invasive (e.g. microelectrodes) or non-invasive means (e.g. transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial electric stimulation, tES, such as tDCS or transcranial alternating current stimulation, tACS). Neurostimulation usually refers to the electromagnetic approaches to neuromodulation.\n\nNeurostimulation technology can improve the life quality of those who are severely paralyzed or suffering from profound losses to various sense organs, as well as for permanent reduction of severe, chronic pain which would otherwise require constant (around-the-clock), high-dose opioid therapy (such as neuropathic pain and spinal-cord injury). It serves as the key part of neural prosthetics for hearing aids, artificial vision, artificial limbs, and brain-machine interfaces. In the case of neural stimulation, mostly an electrical stimulation is utilized and charge-balanced biphasic constant current waveforms or capacitively coupled charge injection approaches are adopted. Alternatively, transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial electric stimulation have been proposed as non-invasive methods in which either a magnetic field or transcranially applied electric currents cause neurostimulation.\n\nBrain stimulation has potentials to treat some disorders such as epilepsy. In this method, scheduled stimulation is applied to specific cortical or subcortical targets. There are available commercial devices that can deliver an electrical pulse at scheduled time intervals. Scheduled stimulation is hypothesized to alter the intrinsic neurophysiologic properties of epileptic networks. The most explored targets for scheduled stimulation are the anterior nucleus of the thalamus and the hippocampus. The anterior nucleus of the thalamus has been studied, which has shown a significant seizure reduction with the stimulator \"on\" versus \"off\" during several months after stimulator implantation. Moreover, the cluster headache (CH) can be treated by using a temporary stimulating electrode at sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG). Pain relief is reported within several minutes of stimulation in this method. To avoid use of implanted electrodes, researchers have engineered ways to inscribe a \"window\" made of zirconia that has been modified to be transparent and implanted in mice skulls, to allow optical waves to penetrate more deeply, as in optogenetics, to stimulate or inhibit individual neurons.\n\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown benefits for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, tremor and dystonia and affective disorders such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, chronic pain and cluster headache. Since DBS can directly change the brain activity in a controlled manner, it is used to map fundamental mechanisms of brain functions along with neuroimaging methods. A simple DBS system consists of two different parts. First, tiny microelectrodes are implanted in the brain to deliver stimulation pulses to the tissue. Second, an electrical pulse generator (PG) generates stimulation pulses, which is connected to the electrodes via microwires.\nPhysiological properties of the brain tissue, which may change with disease state, stimulation parameters, which include amplitude and temporal characteristics, and the geometric configuration of the electrode and the surrounding tissue are all parameters on which DBS of both the normal and the diseased brain depend on. In spite of a huge amount of studies on DBS, its mechanism of action is still not well understood.\nDeveloping DBS microelectrodes is still challenging.\n\nCompared to electrical stimulation that utilizes brief, high-voltage electric shock to activate neurons, which can potentially activate pain fibers, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was developed by Baker in 1985. TMS uses a magnetic wire above the scalp, which carries a sharp and high current pulse. A time variant magnetic field is induced perpendicular to the coil due to the applied pulse which consequently generates an electric field based on Maxwell's law. The electric field provides the necessary current for a non-invasive and much less painful stimulation. There are two TMS devices called single pulse TMS and repetitive pulse TMS (rTMS) while the latter has greater effect but potential to cause seizure. TMS can be used for therapy particularly in psychiatry, as a tool to measure central motor conduction and a research tool to study different aspects of human brain physiology such as motor function, vision, and language. The rTMS method has been used to treat epilepsy with rates of 8–25 Hz for 10 seconds. The other therapeutic uses of rTMS include parkinson diseases, dystonia and mood diseases. Also, TMS can be used to determine the contribution of cortical networks to specific cognitive functions by disrupting activity in the focal brain region. Early, inconclusive, results have been obtained in recovery from coma (persistent vegetative state) by Pape et al. (2009).\n\n\nSpinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective therapy for the treatment of chronic and intractable pain including diabetic neuropathy, failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, phantom limb pain, ischemic limb pain, refractory unilateral limb pain syndrome, postherpetic neuralgia and acute herpes zoster pain. Another pain condition that is a potential candidate for SCS treatment is Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, which is associated with moderate to severe chronic extremity pain. SCS therapy consists of the electrical stimulation of the spinal cord to 'mask' pain. The gate theory proposed in 1965 by Melzack and Wall provided a theoretical construct to attempt SCS as a clinical treatment for chronic pain. This theory postulates that activation of large diameter, myelinated primary afferent fibers suppresses the response of dorsal horn neurons to input from small, unmyelinated primary afferents.\nA simple SCS system consists of three different parts. First, microelectrodes are implanted in the epidural space to deliver stimulation pulses to the tissue. Second, an electrical pulse generator implanted in the lower abdominal area or gluteal region while is connected to the electrodes via wires, and third a remote control to adjust the stimulus parameters such as pulse width and pulse rate in the PG. Improvements have been made in both the clinical aspects of SCS such as transition from subdural placement of contacts to epidural placement, which reduces the risk and morbidity of SCS implantation, and also technical aspects of SCS such as improving percutaneous leads, and fully implantable multi-channel stimulators. However, there are many parameters that need to be optimized including number of implanted contacts, contact size and spacing, and electrical sources for stimulation. The stimulus pulse width and pulse rate are important parameters that need to be adjusted in SCS, which are typically 400 us and 8–200 Hz respectively.\n\nTentative evidence supports transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation. Side effects are few.\n\nCochlear implants have provided partial hearing to more than 120,000 persons worldwide as of 2008. The electrical stimulation is used in a cochlear implant to provide functional hearing in totally deafened persons. Cochlear implants include several subsystem components from the external speech processor and radio frequency (RF) transmission link to the internal receiver, stimulator, and electrode arrays. Modern cochlear implant research started in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1961, a crude single electrode device was implanted in two deaf patients and useful hearing with electric stimulation was reported. The first FDA approved complete single channel device was released in 1984.\nIn cochlear implants, the sound is picked up by a microphone and transmitted to the behind-the-ear external processor to be converted to the digital data. The digitized data is then modulated on a radio frequency signal and transmitted to an antenna inside a headpiece. The data and power carrier are transmitted through a pair of coupled coils to the hermetically sealed internal unit. By extracting the power and demodulating the data, electric current commands are sent to the cochlea to stimulate the auditory nerve through microelectrodes. The key point is that the internal unit does not have a battery and it should be able to extract the required energy. Also to reduce the infection, data is transmitted wirelessly along with power. Inductively coupled coils are the best candidate for power and data telemetry. Parameters needed by the internal unit include the pulse amplitude, pulse duration, pulse gap, active electrode, and return electrode that are used to define a biphasic pulse and the stimulation mode. An example of the commercial devices include Nucleus 22 device that utilized a carrier frequency of 2.5 MHz and later in the newer revision called Nucleus 24 device, the carrier frequency was increased to 5 MHz. The internal unit in the cochlear implants is an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chip that is responsible to ensure safe and reliable electric stimulation. Inside the ASIC chip, there is a forward pathway, a backward pathway, and control units. The forward pathway recovers digital information from the RF signal which includes stimulation parameters and some handshaking bits to reduce the communication error. The backward pathway usually includes a back telemetry voltage\nsampler that reads the voltage over a period of time on the recording electrode. The stimulator block is responsible to deliver predetermined current by external unit to the microelectrodes. This block includes a reference current and a digital to analog converter to transform digital commands to an analog current.\n\nTheoretical and experimental clinical evidences suggest that direct electrical stimulation of the retina might be able to provide some vision to subjects who have lost the photoreceptive elements of their retina. Therefore, visual prostheses are developed to restore vision for the blind by using the stimulation. Depending upon which visual pathway location is targeted for neural stimulation, different approaches have been considered. Visual pathway consists mainly of the eye, optic nerve, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and visual cortex. Therefore, retinal, optic nerve and visual cortex stimulation are the three different methods used in visual prostheses.\nRetinal degenerative diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are two likely candidate diseases in which retinal stimulation may be helpful. Three approaches called intraocular epiretinal, subretinal and extraocular transretinal stimulation are pursued in retinal devices that stimulate remaining retinal neural cells to bypass lost photoreceptors and allow the visual signal to reach the brain via the normal visual pathway. In epiretinal approach, electrodes are placed on the top side of the retina near ganglion cells, whereas the electrodes are placed under the retina in subretinal approaches. Finally, the posterior scleral surface of the eye is the place in which extraocular approach electrodes are positioned. Second Sight and the Humayun group at USC are the most active groups in the design of intraocular retinal prostheses. The ArgusTM 16 retinal implant is an intraocular retinal prosthesis utilizing video processing technologies.\nRegarding to the visual cortex stimulation, Brindley, and Dobelle were the first ones who did the experiments and demonstrated that by stimulating the top side of the visual cortex most of the electrodes can produce visual percept. More recently Sawan built a complete implant for intracortical stimulation and validated the operation in rats\n\nLGN, which is located in the midbrain to relay signals from the retina to the visual cortex, is another potential area that can be used for stimulation. But this area has limited access due to surgical difficulty. The recent success of deep brain stimulation techniques targeting the midbrain has encouraged research to pursue the approach of LGN stimulation for a visual prosthesis.\n\nImplantable pacemakers were proposed for the first time in 1959 and became more sophisticated since then. The therapeutic application of pacemakers consists of numerous rhythm disturbances including some forms of tachycardia (too fast a heart beat), heart failure, and even stroke. Early implantable pacemakers worked only a short time and needed periodic recharging by an inductive link. These implantable pacemakers needed a pulse generator to stimulate heart muscles with a certain rate in addition to electrodes. Today, modern pulse generators are programmed non-invasively by sophisticated computerized machines using RF, obtaining information about the patient's and device's status by telemetry. Also they use a single hermetically sealed lithium iodide (LiI) cell as the battery. The pacemaker circuitry includes sense amplifiers to detect the heart's intrinsic electrical signals, which are used to track heart activity, rate adaptive circuitry, which determine the need for increased or reduced pacing rate, a microprocessor, memory to store the parameters, telemetry control for communication protocol and power supplies to provide regulated voltage.\n\nMicroelectrodes are one of the key components of the neurostimulation, which deliver the current to neurons. Typical microelectrodes have three main components: a substrate (the \"carrier\"), a conductive metal layer, and an insulation material. In cochlear implants, microelectrodes are formed from platinum-iridium alloy. State-of-the-art electrodes include deeper insertion to better match the tonotopic place of stimulation to the frequency band assigned to each electrode channel, improving efficiency of stimulation, and reducing insertion related trauma. These cochlear implant electrodes are either straight or spiral such as Med El Combi 40+ and Advanced Bionics Helix microelectrodes respectively.\nIn visual implants, there are two types of electrode arrays called planar type or three dimensional needle or pillar type, where needle type array such as Utah array is mostly used for cortical and optic nerve stimulations and rarely used in retinal implants due to the possible damage of retina. However, a pillar-shaped gold electrode array on thin-film polyimide has been used in an extraocular implant. On the other hand, planar electrode arrays are formed from flexible polymers, such as silicone, polyimide, and parylene as candidates for retinal implants.\nRegarding to DBS microelectrodes an array, which can be controlled independently, distributed throughout the target nucleus would permit precise control of the spatial distribution of the stimulation, and thus, allow better personalized DBS. There are several requirements for DBS microelectrodes that include long lifetime without injury to the tissue or degradation of the electrodes, customized for different brain sites, long-term biocompatibility of the material, mechanically durable in order to reach the target without being damaged during handling by the implant surgeon, and finally uniformity of performance across the microelectrodes in a particular array. Tungsten microwire, iridium microwires, and sputtered or electrodeposited Platinum-iridium alloy microelectrodes are the examples of microelectrode used in DBS. Silicon carbide is a potential interesting material for realizing biocompatible semiconductor devices.\n\nThe primary findings about neurostimulation originated from the idea to stimulate nerves for therapeutic purposes. The 1st recorded use of electrical stimulation for pain relief goes back to 46 AD, when Scribonius Largus used torpedo fish (electric ray) for relieving headaches. In the late 18th century, Luigi Galvani discovered that the muscles of dead frog legs twitched when struck by direct current on the nervous system. The modulation of the brain activity by electrical stimulation of the motor cortex in dogs was shown in 1870 that resulted in limb movement. From the late 18th century to today many milestones have been developed. Nowadays, sensory prosthetic devices, such as visual implants, cochlear implants, auditory midbrain implants, and spinal cord stimulators and also motor prosthetic devices, such as deep brain stimulators, Bion microstimulators, the brain control and sensing interface, and cardiac electro-stimulation devices are widely used.\n\nIn 2013 the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) coined the term \"electroceutical\" to broadly encompass medical devices that use electrical, mechanical, or light stimulation to affect electrical signaling in relevant tissue types. Clinical neural implants such as cochlear implants to restore hearing, retinal implants to restore sight, spinal cord stimulators for pain relief or cardiac pacemakers and implantable defibrillators are proposed examples of electroceuticals. GSK formed a venture fund and said it would host a conference in 2013 to lay out a research agenda for the field. A 2016 review of research on interactions between the nervous and immune systems in autoimmune disorders and mentioned \"electroceuticals\" in passing and quotation marks, referring to neurostimulation devices in development for conditions like arthritis.\n\nIn addition to the enormous usage of neurostimulation for clinical applications, it is also used widely in laboratories started dates back to 1920s by people link Delgado who used stimulation as an experimental manipulation to study basics of how the brain works. The primary works were on the reward center of the brain in which stimulation of those structures led to pleasure that requested more stimulation. Another most recent example is the electrical stimulation of the MT area of primary visual cortex to bias perception. In particular, the directionality of motion is represented in a regular way in the MT area. They presented monkeys with moving images on screen and monkey throughput was to determine what the direction is. They found that by systematically introducing some errors to the monkey's responses, by stimulating the MT area which is responsible for perceiving the motion in another direction, the monkey responded to somewhere in between the actual motion and the stimulated one. This was an elegant use of stimulation to show that MT area is essential in the actual perception of motion. Within the memory field, stimulation is used very frequently to test the strength of the connection between one bundle of cells to another by applying a small current in one cell which results in the release of neurotransmitters and measuring the postsynaptic potential.\n\nGenerally, a short but high-frequency current in the range of 100 Hz helps strengthening the connection known as long-term potentiation.

During organogenesis, the three germ layers formed from gastrulation: the ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm form the internal organs of the organism \n\nThe cells of each of the three germ layers undergo differentiation, a process where less-specialized cells become more-specialized through the expression of a specific set of genes. Cell differentiation is driven by cell signaling cascades. Differentiation is influenced by extracellular signals such as growth factors that are exchanged to adjacent cells which is called juxtracrine signaling or to neighboring cells over short distances which is called paracrine signaling. Intracellular signals consist of a cell signaling itself (autocrine signaling), also play a role in organ formation. These signaling pathways allows for cell rearrangement and ensures that organs form at specific sites within the organism. The organogenesis process can be studied using embryos and organoids.\n\nThe endoderm is the inner most germ layer of the embryo which gives rise to gastrointestinal and respiratory organs by forming epithelial linings and organs such as the liver, lungs, and pancreas. The mesoderm or middle germ layer of the embryo will form the blood, heart, kidney, muscles, and connective tissues. The ectoderm or outermost germ layer of the developing embryo forms epidermis, the brain, and the nervous system.\n\nWhile each germ layer forms specific organs, in the 1820's, embryologist Heinz Christian Pander discovered that the germ layers cannot form their respective organs without the cellular interactions from other tissues. In humans, internal organs begin to develop within 3–8 weeks after fertilization. The germ layers form organs by three processes: folds, splits, and condensation. Folds form in the germinal sheet of cells and usually form an enclosed tube which you can see in the development of vertebrates neural tube. Splits or pockets may form in the germinal sheet of cells forming vesicles or elongations. The lungs and glands of the organism may develop this way.\n\nA primary step in organogenesis for chordates is the development of the notochord, which induces the formation of the neural plate, and ultimately the neural tube In vertebrate development, the development of the neural tube will give rise to the brain and spinal cord. Vertebrates develop a neural crest that differentiates into many structures, including bones, muscles, and components of the central nervous system. Differentiation of the ectoderm into the neural crest, neural tube, and surface ectoderm is sometimes referred to as neurulation and the embryo in this phase is the neurula. The coelom of the body forms from a split of the mesoderm along the somite axis \n\nIn plants, organogenesis, which is simply the process of forming new organs, occurs continuously and only stops when the plant dies. In the shoot, the shoot apical meristems regularly produce new lateral organs (leaves or flowers) and lateral branches. In the root, new lateral roots form from weakly differentiated internal tissue (e.g. the xylem-pole pericycle in the model plant \"Arabidopsis thaliana\"). \"In vitro\" and in response to specific cocktails of hormones (mainly auxins and cytokinins), most plant tissues can de-differentiate and form a mass of dividing totipotent stem cells called a callus. \" organogenesis can then occur from those cells. The type of organ that is formed depends on the relative concentrations of the hormones in the medium. Plant organogenesis can be induced in tissue culture and used to regenerate plants.\n"}

{"id": "22725238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22725238", "title": "Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver", "text": "Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver\n\nPokémon HeartGold Version and SoulSilver Version are enhanced remakes of the 1999 video games \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\", including the features in \"Pokémon Crystal\". The games are part of the fourth generation of the \"Pokémon\" series of role-playing video games, and were developed by Game Freak, published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. The games were released in Japan on September 12, 2009, and were later released in other countries during March 2010.\n\n\"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\" take place in the Johto region of the franchise's fictional universe, which features special creatures called Pokémon. The basic goal of the game is to become the best Pokémon trainer in the Johto and Kanto regions, which is done by raising and cataloging Pokémon and defeating other trainers.\n\nGame director Shigeki Morimoto aimed to respect the feelings of those who played the previous games, while also ensuring that it felt like a new game to those that were introduced to the series in more recent years. The games have received positive reviews from critics, and as of March 2014, the games' combined sales have reached 12.72 million, making the two games combined the eighth best-selling DS game of all time.\n\n\"Pokémon HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\" are role-playing video games with adventure elements. The basic mechanics of the games are largely the same as their predecessors'. As with all \"Pokémon\" games for hand-held consoles, gameplay is viewed from a third-person overhead perspective, and consists of three basic screens: a field map, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures his party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with one Pokémon and can capture more using Poké Balls. The player can also use the Pokémon to battle or deceive others, often forming alliances or trends via the Team Rocket networks.\n\nWhen the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During battle, the player may fight, use an item, switch the active Pokémon, or flee (the last is not an option in battles against trainers). Pokémon have hit points (HP), which is displayed during combat; when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle unless taken to a Pokémon Center or healed or revived with a Pokémon skill or item. If the player's Pokémon defeats the opposing Pokémon (causes it to faint), it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it will level up; most Pokémon evolve into a new species of Pokémon when they reach a certain level, or when certain conditions are met (commonly, how much a Pokémon statistically 'likes' its trainer).\n\n\"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\" allow the first Pokémon in the player's party to follow them, echoing a mechanic in \"\" in which Pikachu follows the player. Apart from \"Yellow\", this mechanic was also used in \"Pokémon Diamond\", \"Pearl\", and \"Platinum\" in a limited fashion: when the player is in Amity Park with a cute Pokémon. The player may talk to the Pokémon to see or check on how that Pokémon is feeling, and occasionally it may pick up items. A new minigame called the Pokéathlon (called Pokéthlon in Japan) uses the Nintendo DS touchscreen and allows Pokémon to compete in events such as hurdling. The Japanese versions retain slot machines found in previous games, while the international releases of the titles replace the slot machines with a new game called \"Voltorb Flip\", described as a cross between Minesweeper and Picross. Another new item, the GB Sounds, changes the background music to the original 8-bit music from \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\".\n\n\"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\" can access the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (discontinued) to trade, battle, and interact with other players of the games, as well as players of \"Pokémon Diamond\", \"Pearl\", and \"Platinum\". After completing a special Wi-Fi mission download on \"\", the player can send a Deoxys to \"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\".\n\nSimilar to \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\", \"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\" take place in the Johto and Kanto regions of the franchise's fictional universe. The universe centers on the existence of creatures, called Pokémon, with special abilities. The silent protagonist is a young Pokémon trainer who lives in a small town referred to as New Bark Town. At the beginning of the games, the player chooses either a Chikorita, Cyndaquil, or Totodile as their starter Pokémon from Professor Elm. After performing a delivery for the professor and obtaining a Pokédex, he decides to let the player keep the Pokémon and start them on a journey.\n\nThe goal of the game is to become the best trainer in Johto and Kanto (the main region of the first games), which is done by raising Pokémon, completing a catalogue of Pokémon called a Pokédex, defeating the eight Gym Leaders in Johto for Gym Badges, challenging the best trainers in the region known as the Elite Four and the Champion, and then defeating the eight Gym Leaders in the Kanto region. Finally, the player may face off against Red atop Mt. Silver, who serves as the game's final boss.\n\nThroughout the game, the player will battle against members of Team Rocket, a criminal organization originally from Kanto. They were originally defeated by the protagonist of \"FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\", and have attempted to come back as an organization, while awaiting the return of their leader, Giovanni. To attempt to contact him, they take over the radio tower and broadcast a message calling out to him.\n\nWhile being the remakes of \"Gold \" and \"Silver\", the games tie in plot elements of \"Crystal\" as well, such as the added emphasis on Suicune over the other legendary beasts, as well as the post-ending Battle Frontier. (In \"Crystal\", only the Battle Tower was available.) Additionally, Johto and Kanto were given Generation IV features such as Pal Park.\n\nDuring certain points in the game, the player's rival will battle the protagonist in a test of skills. Throughout the game, the player encounters Kimono Girls. After battling all of them in a row, they allow the player to encounter a legendary Pokémon specific to each game (Ho-Oh in \"HeartGold\", and Lugia in \"SoulSilver\"). As per the originals, the other Pokémon can be obtained later on.\n\n\"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\" were released in 2009, ten years after \"Gold\" and \"Silver\"s release for the Game Boy Color. Shigeki Morimoto, the games' director, commented on the development of the remakes: \"The first thing that I knew I needed to bear in mind was to respect the feelings of those people who'd played \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" ten years before. I think that players have very strong memories of the game, so they'd think things like 'Ah, this trainer is still strong' and 'If I do this here, this is going to happen'. I knew I needed to respect these feelings.\" However, Morimoto also needed to make sure that the games would feel as new games to players who began playing \"Pokémon\" in recent years on the Game Boy Advance or the Nintendo DS. An in-game author surrogate of Game Freak's President in Celadon City states that the team strove to make a game that would appeal to players with fond memories without \"redoing the same thing\". He also states that making the game was a \"rewarding challenge\". \"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\" introduced many new features that were absent in the original \"Gold\" and \"Silver\". Several of these features came from the previously released Nintendo DS \"Pokémon\" games, such as \"Diamond\" (2006), \"Pearl\" (2006), and \"Platinum\" (2008).\n\nAn initial rumor started in early May 2009 that Nintendo planned to remake \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\" after the Japanese television show \"Pokémon Sunday\" ended by announcing a \"world-exclusive first announcement\" that would be made on its next show. Kris Pigna of 1UP.com speculated that this alluded to a possible remake of \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" for the Nintendo DS, due to gold and silver disco balls hanging in the background. Pigna further reasoned that this would be consistent with the previously released titles \"Pokémon FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\" which were enhanced remakes of the original \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\". Several days later, Nintendo officially confirmed that \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" were being remade as \"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\" and released their official logos. It also announced that the games would contain numerous updates, although declined to reveal any specifics. The games were released for the Nintendo DS on September 12, 2009 in Japan to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the original \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" release. Junichi Masuda stated on his blog that \"we, Game Freak have spent long and firm time developing above two titles\", and that \"'Pokémon Gold & Silver' will be back with far more excitement.\"\n\nAt the 2009 Pokémon World Championships, Nintendo stated that \"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\" would be released in North America between the months of January and March, Europe sometime around May and June, and Australia in April. \"Announcing these much-anticipated game launches at The Pokémon World Championships allows us to give the news directly to the legions of fans who represent the true heart and soul of Pokémon,\" a spokesperson said. Nintendo updated the official Pokémon English website with information about the new titles, telling readers that the games would feature revamped audiovisual effects, interaction with the DS touch screen, and more \"surprises\". From February 27 to March 13, 2010, video game retailer GameStop hosted a promotion in which players of \"Pokémon Diamond\", \"Pearl\", or \"Platinum\" could use the games' \"Mystery Gift\" feature to download a free Jirachi Pokémon to their game. A \"Pikachu-colored Pichu\" could be downloaded using Wi-Fi that, when taken to the Ilex Forest in-game, unlocked a \"Spiky-eared Pichu\".\n\n, a three-disc soundtrack featuring music scored by Junichi Masuda, Go Ichinose, Hitomi Sato, Shota Kageyama, and Takuto Kitsuta, was released in Japan on October 28, 2009.\n\nIn response to the news confirming the development of \"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\", fans posted their reactions and commentary on the Internet. In particular, IGN editor Jack DeVries reasoned that the primary reason for the updated games was to be compatible with \"Pokémon Diamond\" and \"Pearl\", allowing players to collect old Pokémon species that were previously unobtainable in the new games. He also expressed skepticism that the new titles could match the quality of the originals; stating, \"For me, \"Gold\"/\"Silver\" were amazing because they introduced so many new features that have since become standards for the series. It was the first, and only, time the \"Pokémon\" games have made such a significant expansion. These days we're lucky if we get a new feature that invisibly changes the strategic elements of the game.\" He reminisced over the qualities that made \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" truly unique, including the full color support, internal clock, Pokémon breeding, and PokéGear. Several months later, after DeVries had played through some of the game, he wrote, \"so far I like what I see, even if it all feels very familiar and formulaic at this point.\"\n\nThe games' reception has been highly positive, having an aggregate score of 87 on Metacritic. The titles are among the Top 20 rated DS games in the site's database. Japanese gaming magazine \"Famitsu\" awarded the games a composite score of 37 out of 40 based on four individual reviews, of which the ratings were 9, 10, 9, and 9. The reviewers praised the games for retaining much of the quality that drew them to the original \"Gold\" and \"Silver\". The only drawback mentioned was that the games brought \"no major surprises\". \"Nintendo Power\" gave the games one of the highest scores, remarking on its replay value though criticizing shortly about no improvement in graphic animation for Pokémon sprites. \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" stated that they were the best \"Pokémon\" games yet. \"Game Informer\"s Annette Gonzalez stated \"Even though the classic \"Pokémon\" formula still works as evidenced by \"HeartGold\". I can’t help but hope for a new \"Pokémon\" title that breaks some new ground.\"\n\nIGN's Craig Harris said that the titles were \"like a gap filler to make the wait for a new Pokémon game just a little more bearable\". Jim Sterling of Destructoid stated, \"While it is, at its core, the same game that you've played many years ago, it still manages to feel new and the updated features bolster the original experience in a manner that never intrudes and only enhances\". 1UP.com's Justin Haywald stated that \"\"HeartGold\"/\"SoulSilver\" is easily the best \"Pokémon\" game yet\". VideoGamer.com reviewer Jamin Smith said, \"With \"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\" the \"Pokémon\" series has reached a point where it can't get any better.\" Eurogamer's Keza MacDonald gave the games a 9/10, stating \"They combine everything that was best about the older \"Pokémon\" games\", citing the Pokémon designs and improved graphics and battle system. \"GamePro\"s McKinley Noble stated that \"it's clear that this is a perfect experience for both old-school trainers and the newest generation of \"Pokémon\" fans.\" \"GameZone\" Cliff Bakehorn III said, \"There is not a doubt in my mind: \"Pokémon HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\" are the pinnacle of the entire series.\" Nathan Meunier of GameSpot gave the games one of the lower scores, criticizing them for a lack of innovation. GamesRadar attributed the game's success to being a remake of classic games.\n\nIn Japan, the games sold over 1.48 million units within the first two days of release, topping the Japanese sales chart that week. Within two weeks, the games had sold a combined total of over 2.00 million units. By December 18, 2009, the games' Japanese sales totals had surpassed 3.22 million. In Australia, over 50,000  units sold in one week. In the United States, the games managed collective sales of 1.73 million in their first month, with the \"SoulSilver\" version selling 1.01 million and \"HeartGold\" selling 0.76 million units. The combined sales of the two games made them the highest-selling games of March 2010. > By May 6, 2010, the games had sold 8.40 million units worldwide, and the games reached 10 million sales worldwide by the end of July 2010. As of September 2017, the games' combined sales have reached 12.72 million.\n"}

{"id": "2327311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2327311", "title": "Quality, cost, delivery", "text": "Quality, cost, delivery\n\nQuality, cost, delivery (QCD), sometimes expanded to QCDMS (Quality, Cost, Delivery, Morale, Safety), is a management approach originally developed to help companies within the British automobile sector. QCD analysis is used to assess different components of the production process. It also provides feedback in the form of facts and figures that help managers make logical decisions. By using the gathered data it is easier for organizations to prioritize their future goals.\n\nQCD helps to break down one big thing into many smaller ones, which helps organize and prioritize efforts and, psychologically, prevents the feeling of being overwhelmed.\n\nQCD is a \"three-dimensional\" approach. If there is a problem with even one dimension, the others will inevitably suffer as well. One dimension cannot be sacrificed for the sake of the other two.\n\nQCD offers a method of measuring processes while being applicable to both simple and complicated business processes. It also represents a basis for comparing businesses. For example, a business measuring supplier delivery performance may easily compare its findings against other businesses' performance. But basically QDC altogether will be implemented as a single management in any corporate for man-power reduction.\n\nFlexibility is often included as a measure to QCD resulting in Quality, Cost, Delivery and Flexibility (QCDF). Flexibility relates to the capacity to adapt to changes / modifications . The modifications could be in a)input quality b) output quality c) product specifications d) delivery schedules.\n\nQuality is the ability of a product or service to meet and exceed customer expectations. Customers' requirements determine the quality goals. It is almost always listed first, presumably because poor quality often results in bad business. Quality is the result of the efficiency of the entire production process formed of men, material, and machinery.\n\nEven though quality is now seen as a competitive advantage, US business organizations in the 1970s tended to focus more on cost and productivity. That approach led to a major share of the US market being captured by Japanese business organizations, which onces again proves that in order to be successful an organization has to focus on all three QCD dimensions together.\n\nIt was not until the late 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s that the factor “quality” drastically shifted and became a strategic approach created by Harvard professor David Garvin. This approach focuses on preventing any mistakes and, also, puts a great emphasis on customer satisfaction.\n\nGavin lists eight dimensions of quality:\n\nPerformance is a product’s primary operating characteristics. For example, for a stereo those characteristics would include sound quality, surround sound, and wifi connectivity.\nConformance refers to the degree to which a certain product meets the customer’s expectations.\nThose are any additional features of a product or service. In other words, extras. An example of an extra could be free meals on an airplane, or free drinks at a museum visit. And for a TV, for example, it can be split screen, internet access, embedded apps etc.\nAesthetics refer to a product’s looks, sound, feel, smell, or taste. When it comes to aesthetics, complete customer satisfaction is simply impossible as it is very subjective. For example, one group of customers may like the smell of a certain perfume while other may find it completely repelling.\nThe durability of a product is how long the product lasts before it has to be replaced. Durability can be improved by the usage of long-life materials or improved technology processes in manufacturing. Some products are expected to be more durable than others. Those often include home appliances and automobiles for which durability is a primary characteristic of quality.\nReliability refers to the time until a product breaks down and has to be repaired, but not replaced. This feature is very important for products that have expensive maintenance.\n\"Serviceability is defined by speed, courtesy, competence and ease of repair.\" Customers usually want products that are relatively quickly and easily serviceable.\nThe perceived quality may be affected by the high price or the good aesthetics of a product.\n\nThe quality of a product depends almost entirely on the quality of the supplied materials. One cannot produce a high-quality end product from low-quality components. Suppliers and manufacturers must be willing to work together in order to reduce and eliminate errors and defects, and achieve higher quality end products. SMEs should discuss with their suppliers how quality improvements can affect the overall performance of the supply chain. A properly implemented quality procedure can reduce testing, scrap, rework, etc. This could result in a reduction of production costs.\n\nPoor quality often results in unsatisfied customers which leads to business loss. In an environment where the customer can easily switch to a competitor, producing poor-quality products can be fatal to an organization.\nPoor-quality products must often be reworked or scrapped entirely, which reduces the amount of usable output.\n\nThe biggest cost in most business organizations is the manufacturing cost. Production has a direct responsibility when it comes to controlling and reducing manufacturing cost.\n\nThere are four basic types of manufacturing costs:\nThose are the production cost that stay the same even if the quantity produced increases or decreases. Those costs include:\n\nBusinesses have been under the pressure to drive down costs in order to be more competitive for many years. There are many books and articles nowadays that suggest different ways of reducing costs, some of which are as follows:\n\nLogistics are an essential part in providing good customer service on time:\n\nLogistics customer service can be separated into three elements (before, during and after delivery of the product):\n\nThere are seven measures used to increase profitability:\nNot getting things right the first time means wasted resources, effort and time. This all leads to excessive costs for the company and poor-quality, high-priced products for the customer. NRFT measures the quality of a product and is expressed in “number of defective parts per million”. The number of defective products is divided by the total quantity of finished products. This figure is then multiplied by 10^6 to get the number of defective parts per million.\n\nNRFT can be measured internally (defective parts identified within the production process) or externally (defective parts identified outside the production process (e.g. by the supplier or the customer).\n\nDSA analyses how well a supplier delivers what the customer wants and when they want it. The goal is to achieve 100% on-time delivery without any special deliveries or overtime payments, which only increase the delivery cost. DSA measures the actual delivery performance against the planned delivery schedule.\nFailed deliveries include:\n\nPP is measured by the time it takes (in staff hours) to produce a good-quality product. Obtaining high PP is only possible when:\n\nThe ST ratio shows how quickly a company turns raw materials into finished, ready-to-be-sold products. The quicker the better. A low ST means that the money is tied up in stock, and the company has fewer funds to invest in other parts of its business.\n\nThe OEE shows how well a company uses its equipment and staff.\n\nOEE is calculated on the base of three elements:\n\nVAPP shows how well people are used to turn raw materials into finished goods. In order to calculate VAPP, three things need to be taken into account:\n\nFSU measures the sales revenue generated by a square meter of factory floor space. Usually to achieve higher FSU the floor space has to be reduced. That means eliminating inventory and reducing the necessary space to a minimum.\n\n\n"}

He is one of a generation of pioneering teachers who, along with Jack Kornfield, Joseph Goldstein and Sharon Salzberg, have made the teachings of Theravada Buddhism more widely available to students in the West. Like the writings of his colleague and close friend, Ram Dass (formerly Richard Alpert), Stephen's work is also flavoured by the devotional practices and teachings (also known as Bhakti Yoga) of the Hindu Guru Neem Karoli Baba. This aspect of his teaching may be considered one way in which his work differs from that of the more purely Buddhist oriented teachers named above. Since Buddhism is largely considered a non-theistic faith, his allusions in his teachings to a creator, which he variously terms God, The Beloved, The One and 'Uugghh,' further distinguish his work from that of other contemporary Buddhist writers. \n\nBorn in Albany, New York, Levine attended the University of Miami. He published his first work, \"A Resonance of Hope,\" in 1959. After working as an editor and writer in New York City, Levine was one of the founders of the \"San Francisco Oracle\" in 1966.\n\nHe spent time helping the sick and dying, using meditation as a method of treatment; a program he shared with psychologist Richard Alpert (Ram Dass) and psychiatrist Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.\nThe author of several books about dying, Levine and his wife Ondrea spent one year living as if it were their last. Levine's son Noah initially rejected his father's work, then started to teach meditation on his own. Levine and his wife Ondrea appeared in the 2007 documentary, Meditate and Destroy, that focuses on the life of their son Noah Levine.\n\nFor many years, Stephen and Ondrea lived in near seclusion in the mountains of Northern New Mexico. Ondrea still lives in Northern New Mexico. Stephen Levine died at his home after a long illness on January 17, 2016 at the age of 78.\n\nAlthough drawing upon the teachings of a variety of wisdom traditions, including Native American, Sufism and mystical interpretations of Christianity, Stephen's writing was most significantly informed by the teaching of the Theravada branch of Buddhism.\nGrief Work\n\nOne of the most significant aspects of Stephen's work, and one for which he was perhaps best known, was his pioneering approach to working with the experience of grief. Over 34 years, Stephen and his wife Ondrea counselled concentration camp survivors and their children, Vietnam War veterans as well as victims of sexual abuse. Although Stephen acknowledged that our experience of grief is perhaps at its most intense when a loved one dies, he also drew our attention to grief's more subtle incarnations. \"Our ordinary, everyday grief\" accumulates as a response to the \"burdens of disappointments and disillusionment, the loss of trust and confidence that follows the increasingly less satisfactory arch of our lives.\" In order to avoid feeling this grief we \"armour our hearts,\" which leads to a gradual deadening of our experience of the world When a loved one dies, or indeed when our own death approaches, the intensity of the loss often renders our defenses ineffective and we are swept up by a deluge of griefs, both old and new.\n\nIn the acknowledgements section of his book \"Who Dies: An Investigation of Conscious Living and Conscious Dying\" (1986), Stephen paid tribute to a number of spiritual teachers whose work he acknowledged to have influenced his writing. As well as crediting \"years of Buddhist practice and teaching,\" he cited the writings of Nisargadatta Maharaj, an Indian spiritual teacher and philosopher of Advaita (Nondualism), as well as Neem Karoli Baba and Ramana Maharshi.\n\n"}

Her body remained unidentified until 2015, when concerns previously expressed by friends of Glynn that the unidentified woman may have been their childhood friend, whom they had been unable to locate for several years, were proven to be true.\n\nPrior to her May 2015 identification, Glynn's body had been informally known as the Dana Point Jane Doe, and officially as Jane Doe 87-04457-EL\n\nAt 6:40 on the morning of September 20, 1987, the body of a young Caucasian woman was discovered by joggers at the base of a cliff at Dana Point, California. Her body had no form of identification on her possession, although at the top of the cliff, investigators discovered a half consumed can of Coca-Cola, a purse containing small change, a packet of cigarettes, matches, and two maps of Southern California. On the rear of one of these maps was written the telephone number of a local taxi firm in addition to other notations she had written, indicating she may have asked several individuals for directions.\n\nAn examination of her remains indicated that death had occurred approximately two hours before her body was discovered, and that she was between 18 and 23 years old when she had died. She wore a tan dress, men's underwear and turquoise-colored canvas shoes, all of which were believed to have either been second-hand clothing or hand-me-downs.\nThe woman had been between to in height, and weighed . She had freckles, and her hair was strawberry-blond or light brown and long, reaching to the middle of her back. Her body had no distinctive tattoos, scarred tissue, or birthmarks, although she did have healed acne marks on her upper back and shoulder. Nonetheless, the woman had pierced ears, and had received several distinctive dental fillings in both her upper and lower jaw.\n\nA further examination of her remains revealed she may have been pregnant or undergone a dilation and curettage procedure at one time during her life, and may have also worn braces in her childhood or adolescence.\n\nInvestigators contacted the taxi firm written on the map found at the top of the cliff from where the woman had either fallen or jumped to her death; they subsequently spoke with a driver who informed them he had provided transportation to a female who matched the description of the decedent sometime between 3 and 4 a.m. on September 20. The woman had asked to be picked up from a Unocal Station in Mission Viejo in southern Orange County, requesting to be driven to Laguna Beach, or as far as the $18 she had in her possession would take her. According to the taxi driver, the woman had informed him that her car had broken down close to the gas station from where he had picked her up, but had otherwise been largely uncommunicative throughout the remainder of her journey in his taxi, although he did note she seemed very unhappy in demeanor. This driver further informed investigators he had dropped the young woman off at the Chart House near the intersection of Cove Road and Scenic Drive, and that he had last seen her walking in the direction of the cliff where her body had been found.\n\nBefore entering the taxi, the woman had earlier been seen at the Unocal Station in question, and had used the bathroom at the premises. Investigators would also discover that the woman had earlier entered a nearby Hampton Inn and asked a clerk if there were any \"high end hotels\" in the area.\n\nFrom all evidence discovered at the scene of the death, investigators believed that the woman had climbed over a fence at the edge of the cliff and deliberately jumped to her death. As such, her death was ruled a suicide. Nonetheless, other theories initially remained, including the possibility she may have been pushed from the cliff, or had accidentally fallen. She had initially survived the fall, and had moved somewhat before her death, leaving impressions similar to that of a snow angel. The dead woman would colloquially become known in the press and other media as the Dana Point Jane Doe.\n\nThe purse in the Dana Point Jane Doe's possession was embossed with a woman's name: Carol L. Pinkham. Authorities proceeded to trace all women who had this name; all of whom were found to be still alive. One of these women informed investigators that she had had a purse of this description stolen some 12 years earlier, in 1975.\n\nIn efforts to trigger recognition from those who may have seen the victim in life, a composite drawing of the woman was created by a forensic artist from the Orange County Police Department. Despite these efforts the woman remained unidentified, and her death gradually became a cold case.\nIn May 2015, the Dana Point Jane Doe was formally identified as Holly Jo Glynn. This formal identification occurred after several high school friends of Holly's from Whittier, having been unable to regain contact with Holly via social media or any other conventional means of contact for several years, reported their suspicions to both the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) and the Doe Network that the Dana Point Jane Doe may be Holly Jo Glynn. These efforts to determine whether the Dana Point Jane Doe may have been Holly Jo Glynn were first made in 2011.\n\nIn 2014, these friends contacted Facebook's \"Help ID Me\" page, again expressing their suspicions. These suspicions were subsequently relayed to authorities in early 2015.\n\nThe Orange County Sheriff's Department Coroner Division subsequently contacted surviving relatives of Holly Glynn and obtained DNA samples for formal comparison with the Dana Point Jane Doe. It was eventually announced by \"Unsolved Mysteries\" that, via this technique of DNA analysis, the Dana Point Jane Doe had been Holly Jo Glynn.\n\nMore than 20 years prior to her identification, Holly Jo Glynn's remains had been cremated in a ceremony costing $425, paid for by Orange County on her behalf. Her ashes had then been placed in a cardboard box and buried at sea.\n\n\n\n"}

(1928–1973) was a German industrialist, who was kidnapped and died in the hands of the Provisional IRA in 1973. He was managing director of the Grundig factory in Belfast, and the West German honorary consul for Northern Ireland.\n\nNiedermayer (45) was kidnapped on 27 December 1973, at around 11 pm from his home in West Belfast by two IRA members who lured him outside his house on the pretext that they had accidentally crashed into his car. The abduction incident was witnessed by his two teenage daughters, who had answered the door to them, and by a neighbour who worked at the Grundig factory.\n\nThe Government of the United Kingdom denied at the time that it had received any subsequent demands from the IRA in relation to the kidnapping, but several years later it was revealed that it had done so, and had briefly attempted to negotiate with it, the IRA seeking the transferral from imprisonment in Great Britain to Ulster of two of its members who had been jailed for involvement in a bombing campaign in London in 1973. However the negotiations had ended abruptly from the IRA's side without explanation.\n\nIn March 1980 the Royal Ulster Constabulary, acting on information received, located Niedermayer's body lying face down, hands tied and gagged, in a shallow grave at an illegal rubbish dump at Colin Glen. A forensic examination revealed that the cause of death had been severe injuries sustained to the head after being pistol-whipped with a hand gun. A funeral for his body took place at Dunmurry, where it was buried in the church's graveyard.\n\nEugene McManus (IRA Belfast Brigade Adjutant in 1973), and 42-year-old John Bradley (also an IRA member), were charged in connection with the crime. Bradley was originally charged with murder, but at his trial in 1981 he pleaded guilty to manslaughter, stating that he had accidentally killed Niedermayer whilst he was trying to escape. McManus pleaded guilty to withholding information about the crime and IRA membership. Bradley was subsequently sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, and McManus to 5 years imprisonment.\n\nInformation later obtained by the Royal Ulster Constabulary revealed that the kidnapping operation had been set in motion by Brian Keenan, a former employee at the Belfast Grundig factory that Niedermayer had been the Director of, where Keenan, as a Trade Union representative, had had several confrontations with Niedermayer.\n\nNiedermayer's wife, Ingeborg, returned to Ireland 10 years to the day of her husband's funeral and booked into a hotel at Bray, County Wicklow, where she committed suicide by walking into the sea from an isolated beach. Niedermayer's two daughters, Gabrielle and Renate, both subsequently also committed suicide (respectively in 1991 and 1994). Gabrielle's husband, Robin Williams-Powell, killed himself 5 years later. Gabrielle and Robin are survived by their two daughters, Tanya Williams-Powell and Rachel Robbins.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "752212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=752212", "title": "William Jefferson Blythe Jr.", "text": "William Jefferson Blythe Jr.\n\nWilliam Jefferson Blythe Jr. (February 27, 1918 – May 17, 1946) was an Arkansas salesman of heavy equipment and the father of Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States. Blythe died three months before his son was born.\n\nWilliam Jefferon Blythe Jr. was born as one of nine children to William Jefferson Blythe Sr. (1884–1935), a farmer in Sherman, Texas, and his wife, the former Lou Birchie Ayers (1893–1946). He was of English and Scots descent, with family lines in North America since the days of the thirteen colonies.\n\nBlythe was married four times. He married for the first time in December 1935 to Virginia Adele Gash; they were divorced only thirteen months later. Although no child was born to the couple during their marriage, they later had a son together. After the divorce, Virginia moved to California and married first a man named Coffelt, then a man named Charles Ritzenthaler. However, she and Blythe remained friends, and she visited him on occasion. A son was conceived during these visits, and Henry Leon Blythe was born in Sherman, Texas on June 17, 1938, some eighteen months after his parents had been divorced. Henry's parents lost touch with each other when he was an infant, after his father briefly married and divorced his mother's sister, and he never knew his biological father or paternal siblings. Later in life, Henry Leon Blythe took the name Henry Leon Ritzenthaler in honor of a step-father. He ran several small businesses in Paradise, California, including a janitorial business, and died in 2009. He was unaware of his connection to the future president until the presidential campaign of 1992, when an investigation by \"The Washington Post\", based on birth registry records, revealed details of Bill Clinton's family. Ritzenthaler met his half-brother for the first time around that time, and the physical resemblance between them was remarked upon.\nBlythe next married Minnie Faye Gash, his first wife's sister, in December 1940. The marriage was annulled only four months later, in April 1941, and there were no children. Shortly after the annulment, on May 3, 1941, Blythe married again. His third wife was Wanetta Ellen Alexander of Kansas City, Missouri, and the wedding was held in Jackson County, Missouri. Wanetta gave birth to Blythe's daughter on May 11, 1941, eight days after their wedding. She had become pregnant with Blythe's child prior to his short-lived second marriage to Minnie. Sharon Lee Blythe Pettijohn is the daughter of Wanetta and Blythe, and is still alive in 2016. Blythe and Wanetta were formally divorced three years later, in April 1944. They lost touch immediately afterwards; Wanetta, who eventually settled in Tucson, Arizona, had no inkling of Blythe's subsequent history until the presidential campaign of 1992 and the \"Washington Post\" story. Upon seeing old photographs of Bill Clinton's father flashed on TV, Wanetta \"swears on a stack of Bibles ... that that was the man she was married to\", said her son-in-law Bob Pettijohn, husband of her daughter Sharon.\n\nBlythe's divorce from Wanetta Alexander was granted in court on April 13, 1944. Seven months before that, on September 4, 1943, Blythe had bigamously \"married\" Virginia Dell Cassidy of Bodcaw, Arkansas. Blythe and Cassidy remained married until his death in a car crash on May 17, 1946. Three months after Blythe's death, on August 19, 1946, Cassidy gave birth to their only child, William Jefferson Blythe III, who as a teen took his stepfather's surname and became known as Bill Clinton, the future 42nd President of the United States. Cassidy had no knowledge of Blythe's previous marriages until decades later when \"The Washington Post\" ran an extensive story in 1993, based on birth and marriage registry records, to mark Father's Day.\n\nBlythe was a traveling heavy equipment salesman for most of his brief career. It was while he worked as a travelling salesman that he met and married all his four wives. Some time after his fourth wedding, which happened in September 1943, Blythe shipped out for military service during World War II. He was stationed in Egypt and Italy. He worked in a motor pool, repairing jeeps and tanks. \n\nAfter the war ended, Blythe returned to Hope, Arkansas to be with his wife. Shortly after he returned, he purchased a house in Chicago and readied it to receive his wife and expected child; he was apparently laying the ground for a more settled and conventional married life. Blythe moved to the new house in Chicago while Virginia remained behind in Hope. In Chicago, Blythe returned to his old job as a traveling salesman for the Manbee Equipment Company, which repaired heavy machinery. He died three months before the birth of his son.\n\nOn May 17, 1946, while traveling from Chicago, Illinois, to Hope, Arkansas, Blythe lost control of his 1942 Buick on U.S. Route 60 outside of Sikeston, Missouri, after one of his car's tires blew out. He survived the accident after being thrown from the car, but drowned in a drainage ditch as he tried to pull his way out of the three feet (1 meter) of water in the ditch. Three months later, Blythe's widow, Virginia, gave birth to their son, whom she named William Jefferson Blythe III in honor of his father and grandfather. In 1950, Blythe's widow married Roger Clinton Sr.; 12 years later, Blythe's posthumous son legally adopted his stepfather's surname.\n\nBlythe was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Hope, Hempstead County, Arkansas. In 1994, Virginia was interred beside him. In Clinton's 2004 autobiography, \"My Life\", the elder Blythe was extensively mentioned, including a visit that Clinton made to the site where his father drowned.\n\n\n\n"}
