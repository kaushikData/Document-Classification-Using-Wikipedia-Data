The incident was livestreamed on Facebook, making the incident a live streaming crime.\n\nThe victim met with an acquaintance from high school at a McDonald's on New Year's Eve, and on January 3 was found by a police officer to appear injured while walking with a suspect on a sidewalk. The four suspects were arrested after the incident was livestreamed by one of the women on Facebook, and charged with hate crimes and other offenses.\n\nOn December 31, 2016, the 18-year-old victim was dropped off at a McDonald's in suburban Streamwood, Illinois, by his parents. The victim knew one of the suspects before the incident had occurred as the two had attended the same school in Aurora, Illinois, and the victim had mistakenly thought that the two were friends. When the victim went to the McDonald's, he had the intention of spending time with this friend. On January 2, 2017, the victim's parents filed a report that he was missing.\n\nPolice noted that one of the male suspects stole a van and, pretending that it was his own van, went to meet the victim. The victim got into the van with the suspect, and they went to one of the suspect's friend's houses on the West Side of Chicago for a two-day visit. During that time, the victim slept in the van. On January 3, they went to the residence of two of the other suspects, who were sisters. While at the sisters' apartment, the victim and the male suspect \"play-fought\", which ended in the sisters getting angry and tying the victim up.\n\nThe younger of the two sisters then turned on a Facebook Live stream to record the following events. The victim was bound, gagged, beaten, taunted, had part of his scalp removed with a knife, and was forced to kiss the floor and drink from a toilet bowl. The attackers are heard shouting \"Fuck Trump\" and \"Fuck white people\" in the video. One of the suspects contacted the victim's mother and demanded a $300 ransom for the victim's return. Although the Facebook Live stream only lasted 28 minutes, the victim was tied up for hours. Police suspected that the attack stopped when neighbors in a downstairs apartment complained about noise levels.\n\nThe victim was an 18-year-old, mentally-disabled, white youth.\n\nFour suspects were arrested and charged with aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery, and hate crime. Two were 18-year-old males, Jordan Hill and Tesfaye Cooper, and one was Brittany Covington, an 18-year-old female; her sister Tanishia Covington was a 24-year-old female.\n\nOn February 10, 2017, all four suspects pleaded not guilty at their arraignment. On May 16, 2017, a judge set bail for the four individuals: $900,000 for Hill; \n$800,000 for Cooper; $500,000 for Brittany Covington; and $200,000 for Tanishia Covington. None of the four defendants were able to post bail.\n\nOn December 8, 2017, Brittany Covington plead guilty to the charges of committing a hate crime, intimidation and aggravated battery. Additional charges, such as kidnapping, were dropped as part of her plea deal. Covington was sentenced to four years of probation and 200 hours of community service. Cook County Circuit Judge William Hooks said that he could have sentenced her to prison, but did not because \"I'm not sure if I did that you'd be coming out any better.\"\n\nOn April 19, 2018, Tanishia Covington plead guilty to the charges of committing a hate crime, intimidation and aggravated battery and was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nOn July 5, 2018, Jordan Hill plead guilty to the charges of aggravated kidnapping and committing a hate crime and was sentenced to eight years in prison.\n\nOn July 12, 2018, Tesfaye Cooper (20yo) plead guilty to a hate crime and aggravated kidnapping and has been sentenced to seven years in prison.\n\nOn January 3, at approximately 5:15 p.m., Harrison District Officer Michael Donnelly saw the victim walking with the suspect that the victim had gone to high school with. The victim was observed by Officer Donnelly to be wearing summer clothing during winter conditions. Police said the victim appeared \"injured\" and \"confused\". After checking the victim's name through police databases it was discovered that he had been reported missing. Donnelly later stated, \"I observed him wearing a tank top, inside-out, backwards, jean shorts and sandals on...He was bloodied. He was battered. He was very discombobulated.\" Running the victim's name through police databases, Officer Donnelly discovered that the victim was reported as a missing person and brought him to the hospital.\n\nThe live stream was later deleted, but archives still exist. There was widespread outrage over the beating. In its aftermath, the hashtag #BLMKidnapping was trending on Twitter, implying a connection with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. None of the attackers specifically mentioned Black Lives Matter in the video and the police found there to be no direct connection. Representatives for Black Lives Matter's Chicago branch denounced the beating and stated that they were uninvolved, and police stated that they found no evidence that Black Lives Matter was the motive of the incident. Some far right media outlets and conspiracy theorists (including Infowars and Glenn Beck) suggested that the rhetoric of Black Lives Matter and its supporters had encouraged the attackers. Other commentators disputed this.\n\nPresident Barack Obama released a statement condemning the incident, saying, \"What we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time... Whether it's tensions between police and communities, (or) hate crimes of the despicable sort that has just now recently surfaced on Facebook.\" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said, \"Anyone who has seen it [finds the video] both sickening and sickened by it,\" while Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner and his wife Diana said that they were \"deeply saddened and disturbed by the horrific violence\" depicted in the live stream.\n"}
{"id": "27994180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27994180", "title": "A Clockwork Origin", "text": "A Clockwork Origin\n\n\"A Clockwork Origin\" is the ninth episode of the sixth season of the animated sitcom \"Futurama\". It aired on Comedy Central on August 12, 2010. In the episode, Professor Farnsworth leaves Earth after being frustrated by anti-evolutionists' belief in \"Creaturism\", a form of Creationism. He and the Planet Express crew arrive at a lifeless planet and the Professor introduces nanobots into the environment. The nanobots rapidly begin evolving into mechanical organisms, allowing the crew to witness a whole new evolutionary history that unfolds before their eyes.\n\nThe episode was written by Dan Vebber and directed by Dwayne Carey-Hill and received mostly mixed reviews from critics.\n\nProfessor Farnsworth finds himself arguing with Dr. Banjo, a hyper-intelligent orangutan who believes in \"Creaturism\", a form of creationism. In an attempt to prove evolution did occur, the Professor excavates the lost missing link, which Dr. Banjo depicts as \"Homo farnsworth\" anachronistically riding a \"Stegosaurus\" in an attempt to support his Creaturist beliefs. The Professor becomes fed up and resolves to leave Earth. He takes the rest of the crew with him to an abandoned planet to live in solitude. \n\nAfter Professor inserts nanobots into the nearby pond to clean the water, the nanobots evolve rapidly into flora and fauna. Robotic versions of an \"Elasmosaurus\" and a \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" attack the crew, but a solar flare short circuits the dinosaur robots, causing a mass extinction of every robot creature except for \"small mammalian robots\" that were hiding in caves, including Bender. \n\nThe next day, the crew wakes up to find both Leela and Amy kidnapped by caveman-like robots, but the following day, they find that Leela and Amy are free, because the robot cavemen have since evolved into a completely civilized, modern robot society. The Professor states that he is proud of the nanobots' growth after he dumped their ancestors in a pond a few days ago. The robots, who believe unquestioningly in robot evolution, are angered by Farnsworth, when he shows a picture of a robot (Bender) riding a robotic \"Stegosaurus\" at the start of their creation. Bender represents him in court and in his arguments, states that the Professor is not arguing against evolution, but only claims a small role in beginning it by providing the materials necessary (the nanobots). He also tries to declare Professor insane. \n\nThe following day, the robots have now evolved into a state of incorporeal transcendent higher consciousness. They are no longer concerned with the Professor any more, finding corporeal beings altogether irrelevant, and sends the crew home. The Professor and Dr. Banjo reconcile their differences. Dr. Banjo argues that what the Professor witnessed was evolution, but evolution set in motion by an intelligent creator. The Professor agrees that it is possible, however unlikely that Earth evolution was set in motion the same way.\n\nThe title are references to the books \"A Clockwork Orange\" and \"On the Origin of Species\". It could also be considered a reference to William Paley's Watchmaker analogy, a teleological argument found in his work \"Natural Theology\". The episode includes several cultural references related to depictions of evolutionary history and the debate between evolution and creationism. The crew's encounters with the robotic dinosaurs and Amy's two-piece cavewoman outfit are parodies of the 1940 fantasy film, \"One Million B.C.\" The trial held in the episode also parodies the Scopes Monkey Trial. During the anti-evolution rally, a Flying Spaghetti Monster—a satirical symbol —appears, arguing against evolution.\n\n\"A Clockwork Origin\" originally aired August 12, 2010 on Comedy Central. In its original American broadcast, \"A Clockwork Origin\" was viewed by an estimated 1.926 million viewers with a 1.3 rating/2% share in the Nielsen ratings and a 1.0 rating/3% share in the 18-49 demographic, nearly identical to the previous week's episode, \"The Late Philip J. Fry\".\n\nThe episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Merrill Barr of \"Film School Rejects\" gave the episode a mixed review, calling it \"[a] 50/50 episode of Futurama.\" He stated, \"There were parts I loved, and parts I hated. That is all.\" He also criticized the Zoidberg and Cubert subplot saying, \"while on his own Cubert is a funny character, paring him with a character like Zoidberg is a bad idea.\" Zack Handlen of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode a B+, saying, \"It mostly worked, but I was mildly disappointed by the end, because I keep waiting for the episode to move from good to great.\" Sean Gandert of \"Paste\" gave the episode a score of 7.9/10, writing \"'A Clockwork Origin' was still a good, fun episode, but was a more disposable piece of entertainment than the show can be at its absolute best.\"\n\nRobert Canning of IGN gave the episode a strong, positive review, rating it a 9.0/10. Canning praised the episode's pacing as the season's best describing \"A Clockwork Origin\" as \"a very funny, very solid episode.\" Danny Gallagher of \"TV Squad\" gave the episode a positive review as well, saying \"It's far from the best episode of the season, but that's still saying a lot for a show that has managed to find new ways to stay fresh while it's been in the can for so long.\" He also called the robot dinosaur world a perfect parody of \"One Million B.C.\".\n\n\n"}

After the assassination, Abantidas had the remaining friends and relations of Cleinias banished or put to death; Aratus, who was then only seven years old, narrowly escaped death by fleeing into the house of Soso, Abantidas' sister, who happened to be married to Prophantus, the late Cleinias' brother. Abantidas was fond of literature, and was accustomed to attending the philosophical discussions of Deinias of Argos and Aristotle, the dialectician, in the agora of Sicyon: on one of these occasions, with the complicity of the two rhetors, he was murdered by his enemies in 252.

{"id": "697755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=697755", "title": "Anthony Spilotro", "text": "Anthony Spilotro\n\nAnthony John Spilotro (May 19, 1938 – June 14, 1986), nicknamed \"The Ant\", was an American mobster and enforcer for the Chicago Outfit in Las Vegas, Nevada, during the 1970s and 1980s. His job was to protect and oversee the Outfit's illegal casino profits (the \"skim\"), when some of the casinos were run by Frank Rosenthal. Spilotro replaced Outfit member Marshall Caifano in Las Vegas. Spilotro eventually ran afoul of his organized crime overseers who disapproved of his handling Las Vegas affairs, and who arranged his murder in 1986. Spilotro served as the basis for the character Nicky Santoro in Martin Scorsese's mafia classic, Casino. \n\nThe fourth of six children, Anthony John Spilotro was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. He attended Burbank Elementary School, and entered Steinmetz High School in 1953. His father Pasquale \"Patsy\" Spilotro Sr. had emigrated from Triggiano, Province of Bari, Italy, and had arrived at Ellis Island in 1914. When Pasquale arrived in the US, however, he had no money, education, or particular skill. Unlike most Italian immigrants who settled in \"The Patch\", the Spilotros lived at 2152 North Melvina Avenue. He and his wife Antoinette Spilotro ran Patsy's Restaurant, located at 470 N. Ogden, which was frequented by mobsters such as Salvatore \"Sam\" Giancana, Jackie \"The Lackey\" Cerone, Gus Alex, and Francesco \"Frank the Enforcer\" Nitti. In 1954, Pasquale suffered a fatal aneurysm and died at the age of 55, leaving six sons.\n\nAlong with four of his brothers, John, Vincent, Victor, and Michael, Tony became involved in criminal activity early in life. The remaining brother, Pasquale Jr., went to college and became a highly respected oral surgeon in the Chicago area. Tony became a made man in 1963, during his mid 20s.\n\nHe was nicknamed \"Tony the Ant\" by the media after FBI Special Agent William Roemer referred to Spilotro as \"that little pissant.\" Since the media couldn't use \"pissant,\" they shortened it to the \"Ant.\" He was also called \"Tough Tony.\"\n\nSpilotro dropped out of Steinmetz High School in his sophomore year and quickly became known for a succession of petty crimes such as shoplifting and purse snatching. His first arrest occurred on January 11, 1955, when he attempted to steal a watch from a River Forest store and was charged with larceny; he was fined $10 and placed on probation.\n\nIn 1976, Spilotro formed a Las Vegas-based burglary ring with his brother Michael and Herbert \"Fat Herbie\" Blitzstein, utilizing about eight associates as burglars. The crew became known as the Hole in the Wall Gang because of its penchant for gaining entry by drilling through the exterior walls and ceilings of the buildings they burglarized. The Hole in the Wall Gang operated out of The Gold Rush, Ltd jewelry store. Other gang members included Peter Basile, Frank Cullotta, Joseph Cusumano, Samuel Cusumano, Joseph D'Argento, Ernesto \"Ernie\" Davino, Leonardo \"Leo\" Guardino, Frank DeLegge, Michael LaJoy, Ernest Lehnigg, Wayne Matecki, \"Crazy Larry\" Neumann, Butch Panczko, Peanuts Panczko, Pops Panczko, Salvatore \"Sonny\" Romano, Gerald Tomasczek, Carl Urbanotti, and former Las Vegas detective Joseph Blasko, who acted as a lookout and who later worked as a bartender at the Crazy Horse Too, a gentleman's club; Blasko died of a heart attack in 2002.\n\nFollowing a botched burglary at Bertha's Household Products on July 4, 1981, Blasko, Cullotta, Davino, Guardino, Matecki, and Neumann were arrested and each charged with burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, attempted grand larceny, and possession of burglary tools. They were locked into the Las Vegas Police Department's holding cell in downtown Las Vegas. The only members of Spilotro's gang not arrested for the July 4 burglary were Blitzstein, Cusumano, Romano, and Michael Spilotro. By this time, Spilotro's relationship with Frank Rosenthal had severely deteriorated, as Spilotro had had an affair with Rosenthal's wife, Geri McGee. Meanwhile, Cullotta had turned state's witness, testifying against Spilotro. But the testimony was insufficient, and Tony was acquitted.\n\nThe FBI first \"flipped\" Charles \"Chuckie\" Crimaldi, a former associate of Sam DeStefano. Crimaldi had been a \"juice collector\" for DeStefano during the 1950s and 1960s. He gave evidence against Spilotro and DeStefano in the murder of real estate agent-loanshark Leo Foreman on November 19, 1963; DeStefano and Spilotro were both acquitted. Crimaldi also provided information on his part in murdering another DeStefano loanshark, William \"Action\" Jackson, to keep him from cutting a deal with the FBI in exchange for a lighter sentence on a hijacking charge. Roemer denied Jackson had cut any deal with the FBI.\n\nMany years later, in 1982, Sal Romano, a member of the Hole in the Wall Gang who specialized in disabling alarm systems, became a government informant. He worked counter-surveillance during botched Bertha's Las Vegas burglary in 1981. Unknown to the rest of the Wall Gang, Romano had tipped off federal agents and police, who were waiting for the burglars when they were drilling through the roof at Bertha's.\n\nWhen Spilotro's childhood friend Frank Cullotta was arrested in the attempted Bertha's burglary, the FBI presented him with a wiretap tape that revealed that Spilotro was out to have him murdered. Cullotta agreed to become a federal witness. In court, he admitted that he had done \"muscle work\" on Spilotro's behalf for many years, including setting up the infamous Chicago 1962 \"M&M Murders\" of James Miraglia and Billy McCarthy. Spilotro had been ordered by Outfit bosses to track down and kill the two men after they robbed and murdered three people in a suburban Chicago neighborhood territory that was considered off limits since several Outfit members lived there. Cullotta also testified that Spilotro ordered him to murder Las Vegas mob associate Sherwin \"Jerry\" Lisner in 1979.\n\nLas Vegas authorities and the FBI discovered that Spilotro had ordered Larry Neumann to murder Cullotta and Wayne Matecki. Cullotta, who had publicly admitted to being a killer himself, supplied more information about the M&M Murders. Neumann tried to post bail for Cullotta so he could murder both him and Matecki, but the police had Cullotta's bail revoked to protect him. Cullotta received eight years in connection with a previous burglary. In September 1983, Spilotro was indicted in Las Vegas on murder and racketeering charges based on Cullotta's testimony, but the charges didn't hold up.\n\nMeanwhile, Spilotro was tried before Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas J. Maloney for the M&M Murders, while Neumann was sentenced to life in prison in 1983. Maloney did not accept Cullotta's statements as evidence or as proof \"beyond a reasonable doubt\", and then, in turn, acquitted Spilotro. In 1992, Maloney himself would later be convicted through Operation Greylord of accepting bribes in several related and unrelated cases.\n\nCullotta testified before the President's Commission on Organized Crime and the Florida Governor's Commission on Organized Crime, and appeared at a sentencing hearing for Chicago mobster Joseph Lombardo. He later served as a technical advisor for the 1995 Martin Scorsese movie \"Casino\", in which Cullotta also played a small role as \"Curly\", one of Remo Gaggi's hitmen, who murders Andy Stone, a union boss, in an icy restaurant parking lot.\n\nSpilotro and his brother Michael, 41, disappeared June 14, 1986 when they drove away together from Michael's Oak Park home saying they would return in several hours. Their car, a 1986 Lincoln, was recovered several days later in a motel parking lot near O'Hare Airport. On June 22, their bodies were found, one on top of the other and clad only in undershorts, buried under 5 feet of wet earth in a muddy grave within the 12,000-acre Willow Slough preserve, just 2 miles east of the Illinois-Indiana state line. The freshly turned earth had been noticed by a farmer who thought that the remains of a deer killed out of season had been buried there by a poacher, and notified authorities. Their decomposing remains were identified by their brother Pasquale, Jr. and dental x-ray records. An autopsy determined that the brothers had been savagely beaten.\n\nIn January 1986, in the wake of the imprisonment of Joseph Aiuppa and John Cerone for skimming Las Vegas casino profits, a meeting was held at the Czech Lodge in North Riverside, Illinois. Most of the ‘upper echelon’ were there, including Outfit boss Tony \"Joe Batters\" Accardo. Accardo had decided to appoint Samuel Carlisi as the \"Street Boss\" in charge of Outfit operations to replace Aiuppa. Carlisi told the group that Accardo would stay on as \"consigliere\" and would have final say, as well as Gus Alex staying head of the connection guys. He then went on to the first problem: Spilotro, and how things had gone down since he took over Vegas. Mobster and mob enforcer Rocco Infelice said, \"Hit him.\" Everyone else at the meeting agreed.\n\nIt was, at the time, suspected that Spilotro and his brother Michael were called by Carlisi to a meeting at a hunting lodge owned by Aiuppa, Spilotro's former mob boss. Original reports stated the Spilotros were buried alive after the beating, in an Enos, Indiana cornfield. However, in 2007, mob assassin Nicholas Calabrese testified at the \"Operation Family Secrets\" that the brothers were killed in a Bensenville, Illinois basement where the Spilotros believed Michael would be inducted into The Outfit. According to court testimony, when Tony entered the basement and realized what was about to occur, he asked if he could \"say a prayer\". It is possible, as the target of the \"hit\" was Anthony, that Michael was only killed because he was with him, or that the Outfit had decided from the outset that both brothers had to go to prevent any possible future revenge killings.\n\nNo arrests were made until April 25, 2005, when 14 members of the Chicago Outfit (including reputed boss James Marcello) were indicted for 18 murders, including the Spilotros'. The suspected murderers included \"capo\" Albert Tocco from Chicago Heights, Illinois, who was sentenced to 200 years after his wife Betty testified against him in 1989. She claimed that the day after the Spilotro murders, she was called to pick up Tocco 1 mile (1.6 km) from where their bodies would later be found. She said that Tocco was dressed in dirty blue work clothes. Betty Tocco further implicated Nicholas \"Nicky\" Guzzino, Dominic \"Tootsie\" Palermo, and Albert \"Chic\" Roviaro in the murders. Tocco died at the age of 77 in an Indiana prison on September 21, 2005.\n\nAnother suspect in the murders was Frank \"The German\" Schweihs, a convicted extortionist and alleged Chicago assassin who was suspected of involvement in several murders including the Spilotros, Allen Dorfman (of the Teamster's Pension Fund), and a former girlfriend. Schweihs was arrested by the FBI on December 22, 2005. At the time, he was a fugitive living in a Berea, Kentucky apartment complex. Schweihs had slipped away before prosecutors were able to arrest him and 13 others, including Marcello.\n\nOn May 18, 2007, the star witness in the government's case against 14 Chicago mob figures, Nicholas Calabrese, pleaded guilty to taking part in a conspiracy that included 18 murders, including the hits on Anthony and Michael Spilotro. Under heavy security, Calabrese admitted that he took part in planning or carrying out 14 of the murders, including the Spilotro killings. He became the key witness against his brother, Frank Calabrese, Sr., and other major mob figures charged in the government's Family Secrets Trial. Calabrese agreed to testify after the FBI showed him DNA evidence linking him to the murder of fellow hit-man John Fecarotta, who was also allegedly involved in the Spilotro slayings.\n\nIn September 2007, Frank Calabrese, Sr. and four other men—Marcello, Joseph Lombardo, Paul \"The Indian\" Schiro, and former Chicago police officer Anthony \"Twan\" Doyle—were convicted of mob-related crimes. On September 27, 2007, Marcello was found guilty by a federal jury in the murders of both Spilotro brothers. On February 5, 2009, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murders.\n\nSpilotro was replaced in Las Vegas by Donald \"The Wizard of Odds\" Angelini. He is survived by his wife Nancy, his adopted son Vincent, and his remaining brothers.\n\nBy the time of his death in 1986, the FBI suspected Spilotro was responsible for at least 22 murders. He was indicted in 1983 for his role in the murders of Bill McCarthy and James Miraglia, popularized in the press as the \"M&M Murders.\" McCarthy and Miraglia were two young criminals who had robbed and shot two businessmen and a woman in the mobster-populated neighborhood of Elmwood Park, near Chicago. They were also in debt to Spilotro's old boss, Sam DeStefano. Their bodies were discovered on May 15, 1962, in the trunk of a car dumped on the Southwest Side of Chicago. Both had been beaten badly and had their throats slit. From McCarthy's injuries, it seems his head was placed in a vise, popping out his eye, presumably to persuade him to disclose the whereabouts of Miraglia. The murder of Bill McCarthy (renamed \"Tony Dogs\") is portrayed in Martin Scorsese's 1995 film \"Casino\". Spilotro would later refer to McCarthy as the toughest man he ever met.\n\nSpilotro may have been involved in the attempted car bombing murder of Lefty Rosenthal on October 4, 1982. He was also incriminated in the murder of his onetime mentor \"Mad\" Sam DeStefano on April 15, 1973, while DeStefano, his brother Mario and Spilotro were all facing trial for the murder of Leo Foreman, a local collector for the mob, who had been tortured to death in Sam DeStefano's basement. Spilotro is further suspected of murdering San Diego real estate heiress Tamara Rand (an event portrayed in the film \"Casino\"); Teamsters Union executive Allen Dorfman; and Danny Siefert, the manager of the International Fiber Glass Company. Siefert was to be a principal witness in the fraud case but was shot in front of his wife and four-year-old son in September 1974. The fiberglass company was later burned to the ground by arsonists, whereupon they claimed the insurance money.\n\nAccording to former Willow Springs, Illinois, police chief Michael Corbitt, statements by Outfit Capo Sal Bastone implicated Spilotro in the murder of former Chicago Outfit boss Sam Giancana. The FBI believes Spilotro was also involved in the torture murder of loan shark enforcer William \"Action\" Jackson, who worked for DeStefano in the 1950s and 1960s. The Chicago Outfit mistakenly believed Jackson had become an FBI informant in 1961. A gang led by Sam DeStefano took Jackson to a meat packing plant, where he was tortured. Jackson was left near death for three days before finally succumbing to his injuries. Allegedly, Spilotro was a member of the gang that tortured and murdered him.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4513", "title": "Banshee", "text": "Banshee\n\nA banshee ( ; Modern Irish , , from , , \"woman of the fairy mound\" or \"fairy woman\") is a female spirit in Irish mythology who heralds the death of a family member, usually by wailing, shrieking, or keening. Her name is connected to the mythologically important tumuli or \"mounds\" that dot the Irish countryside, which are known as síde (singular \"síd\") in Old Irish.\n\nThere are many varying descriptions of the banshee. Sometimes she has long streaming hair and wears a grey cloak over a green dress, and her eyes are red from continual weeping. She may be dressed in white with red hair and a ghastly complexion, according to a firsthand account by Ann, Lady Fanshawe in her \"Memoirs\". Lady Wilde in \"Ancient Legends of Ireland\" provides another:\nSometimes the banshee assumes the form of some sweet singing virgin of the family who died young, and has been given the mission by the invisible powers to become the harbinger of coming doom to her mortal kindred. Or she may be seen at night as a shrouded woman, crouched beneath the trees, lamenting with veiled face, or flying past in the moonlight, crying bitterly. And the cry of this spirit is mournful beyond all other sounds on earth, and betokens certain death to some member of the family whenever it is heard in the silence of the night.\nThe physical size of the banshee is another physical feature that differs between regional accounts. Though some accounts of her standing unnaturally tall are recorded, the majority of tales that describe her height state the banshee's stature as short, anywhere between one foot and four feet. Her exceptional shortness often goes alongside the description of her as an old woman, though it may also be intended to emphasize her state as a fairy creature.\n\nIn Ireland and parts of Scotland, a traditional part of mourning is the keening woman (\"bean chaointe\"), who wails a lament - in , (Munster dialect), (Connaught dialect) or (Ulster dialect), \"caoin\" meaning \"to weep, to wail\". This keening woman may in some cases be a professional, and the best keeners would be in high demand.\n\nIrish legend speaks of a lament being sung by a fairy woman, or banshee. She would sing it when a family member died or was about to die, even if the person had died far away and news of their death had not yet come. In those cases, her wailing would be the first warning the household had of the death.\n\nThe banshee also is a predictor of death. If someone is about to enter a situation where it is unlikely they will come out of alive she will warn people by screaming or wailing, giving rise to a banshee also being known as a wailing woman.\n\nIt is often stated that the banshee laments only the descendants of the pure Milesian stock of Ireland, sometimes clarified as surnames prefixed with O' and Mac, and some accounts even state that each family has its own banshee. One account, however, also included the Geraldines, as they had apparently become \"more Irish than the Irish themselves,\" countering the lore ascribing banshees exclusively to those of Milesian stock.\n\nWhen several banshees appear at once, it indicates the death of someone great or holy. The tales sometimes recounted that the woman, though called a fairy, was a ghost, often of a specific murdered woman, or a mother who died in childbirth.\n\nMost, though not all, surnames associated with banshees have the \"Ó\" or \"Mc/Mac\" prefix - that is, surnames of Goidelic origin, indicating a family native to the Insular Celtic lands rather than those of the Norse, English, or Norman invaders. Accounts reach as far back as 1380 to the publication of the \"Cathreim Thoirdhealbhaigh\" (\"Triumphs of Torlough\") by Sean mac Craith. Mentions of banshees can also be found in Norman literature of that time.\n\nThe Ua Briain banshee is thought to be named Aibell and the ruler of 25 other banshees who would always be at her attendance. It is possible that this particular story is the source of the idea that the wailing of numerous banshees signifies the death of a great person.\n\nIn some parts of Leinster, she is referred to as the \"bean chaointe\" (keening woman) whose wail can be so piercing that it shatters glass. In Scottish folklore, a similar creature is known as the bean nighe or \"ban nigheachain\" (little washerwoman) or \"nigheag na h-àth\" (little washer at the ford) and is seen washing the bloodstained clothes or armour of those who are about to die. In Welsh folklore, a similar creature is known as the hag of the mist. \n\n"}
{"id": "15501189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15501189", "title": "Bees algorithm", "text": "Bees algorithm\n\nIn computer science and operations research, the bees algorithm is a population-based search algorithm which was developed by Pham, Ghanbarzadeh and et al. in 2005. It mimics the food foraging behaviour of honey bee colonies. In its basic version the algorithm performs a kind of neighbourhood search combined with global search, and can be used for both combinatorial optimization and continuous optimization. The only condition for the application of the bees algorithm is that some measure of distance between the solutions is defined. The effectiveness and specific abilities of the bees algorithm have been proven in a number of studies.\n\nA colony of honey bees can extend itself over long distances (over 14 km) and in multiple directions simultaneously to harvest nectar or pollen from multiple food sources (flower patches). \nA small fraction of the colony constantly searches the environment looking for new flower patches. These scout bees move randomly in the area surrounding the hive, evaluating the profitability (net energy yield) of the food sources encountered. When they return to the hive, the scouts deposit the food harvested. Those individuals that found a highly profitable food source go to an area in the hive called the “dance floor”, and perform a ritual known as the waggle dance. \nThrough the waggle dance a scout bee communicates the location of its discovery to idle onlookers, which join in the exploitation of the flower patch. Since the length of the dance is proportional to the scout’s rating of the food source, more foragers get recruited to harvest the best rated flower patches. After dancing, the scout returns to the food source it discovered to collect more food. \nAs long as they are evaluated as profitable, rich food sources will be advertised by the scouts when they return to the hive. Recruited foragers may waggle dance as well, increasing the recruitment for highly rewarding flower patches. Thanks to this autocatalytic process, the bee colony is able to quickly switch the focus of the foraging effort on the most profitable flower patches.\n\nThe bees algorithm mimics the foraging strategy of honey bees to look for the best solution to an optimisation problem. Each candidate solution is thought of as a food source (flower), and a population (colony) of \"n\" agents (bees) is used to search the solution space. Each time an artificial bee visits a flower (lands on a solution), it evaluates its profitability (fitness).\n\nThe bees algorithm consists of an initialisation procedure and a main search cycle which is iterated for a given number \"T\" of times, or until a solution of acceptable fitness is found. Each search cycle is composed of five procedures: recruitment, local search, neighbourhood shrinking, site abandonment, and global search.\n\nIn the initialisation routine \"ns\" scout bees are randomly placed in the search space, and evaluate the fitness of the solutions where they land. For each solution, a neighbourhood (called flower patch) is delimited.\n\nIn the recruitment procedure, the scouts that visited the \"nb\"≤\"ns\" fittest solutions (best sites) perform the waggle dance. That is, they recruit foragers to search further the neighbourhoods of the most promising solutions. The scouts that located the very best \"ne\"≤\"nb\" solutions (elite sites) recruit \"nre\" foragers each, whilst the remaining \"nb\"-\"ne\" scouts recruit \"nrb\"≤\"nre\" foragers each. Thus, the number of foragers recruited depends on the profitability of the food source.\n\nIn the local search procedure, the recruited foragers are randomly scattered within the flower patches enclosing the solutions visited by the scouts (local exploitation). If any of the foragers in a flower patch lands on a solution of higher fitness than the solution visited by the scout, that forager becomes the new scout. If no forager finds a solution of higher fitness, the size of the flower patch is shrunk (neighbourhood shrinking procedure). Usually, flower patches are initially defined over a large area, and their size is gradually shrunk by the neighbourhood shrinking procedure. As a result, the scope of the local exploration is progressively focused on the area immediately close to the local fitness best. If no improvement in fitness is recorded in a given flower patch for a pre-set number of search cycles, the local maximum of fitness is considered found, the patch is abandoned (site abandonment), and a new scout is randomly generated.\n\nAs in biological bee colonies, a small number of scouts keeps exploring the solution space looking for new regions of high fitness (global search). The global search procedure re-initialises the last \"ns\"-\"nb\" flower patches with randomly generated solutions.\n\nAt the end of one search cycle, the scout population is again composed of \"ns\" scouts: \"nr\" scouts produced by the local search procedure (some of which may have been re-initialised by the site abandonment procedure), and \"ns\"-\"nb\" scouts generated by the global search procedure. The total artificial bee colony size is \"n\"=\"ne\"•\"nre\"+(\"nb\"-\"ne\")•\"nrb\"+\"ns\" (elite sites foragers + remaining best sites foragers + scouts) bees.\n\nIn addition to the basic bees algorithm, there are a number of improved or hybrid versions of the BA, each of which focuses on some shortcomings of the basic BA. These variants include (but are not limited to) fuzzy or enhanced BA (EBA), grouped BA (GBA), hybrid modified BA (MBA) and so on.\nThe pseudo-code for the grouped BA (GBA) is as follows.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "480700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=480700", "title": "Biosensor", "text": "Biosensor\n\nA biosensor is an analytical device, used for the detection of a chemical substance, that combines a biological component with a physicochemical detector. \nThe \"sensitive biological element\", e.g. tissue, microorganisms, organelles, cell receptors, enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, etc., is a biologically derived material or biomimetic component that interacts, binds, or recognizes with the analyte under study. The biologically sensitive elements can also be created by biological engineering.\nThe \"transducer\" or the \"detector element\", which transforms one signal into another one, works in a physicochemical way: optical, piezoelectric, electrochemical,\nelectrochemiluminescence etc., resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biological element, to easily measure and quantify.\nThe biosensor reader device with the associated electronics or signal processors that are primarily responsible for the display of the results in a user-friendly way. This sometimes accounts for the most expensive part of the sensor device, however it is possible to generate a user friendly display that includes transducer and sensitive element (holographic sensor). The readers are usually custom-designed and manufactured to suit the different working principles of biosensors.\n\nA biosensor typically consists of a bio-recognition site, biotransducer component, and electronic system which includes a signal amplifier, processor, and display. Transducers and electronics can be combined, e.g., in CMOS-based microsensor systems. The recognition component, often called a bioreceptor, uses biomolecules from organisms or receptors modeled after biological systems to interact with the analyte of interest. This interaction is measured by the biotransducer which outputs a measurable signal proportional to the presence of the target analyte in the sample. The general aim of the design of a biosensor is to enable quick, convenient testing at the point of concern or care where the sample was procured.\n\nIn a biosensor, the bioreceptor is designed to interact with the specific analyte of interest to produce an effect measurable by the transducer. High selectivity for the analyte among a matrix of other chemical or biological components is a key requirement of the bioreceptor. While the type of biomolecule used can vary widely, biosensors can be classified according to common types of bioreceptor interactions involving: antibody/antigen, enzymes/ligands, nucleic acids/DNA, cellular structures/cells, or biomimetic materials.\n\nAn immunosensor utilizes the very specific binding affinity of antibodies for a specific compound or antigen. The specific nature of the antibody-antigen interaction is analogous to a lock and key fit in that the antigen will only bind to the antibody if it has the correct conformation. Binding events result in a physicochemical change that in combination with a tracer, such as a fluorescent molecules, enzymes, or radioisotopes, can generate a signal. There are limitations with using antibodies in sensors: 1.The antibody binding capacity is strongly dependent on assay conditions (e.g. pH and temperature) and 2. The antibody-antigen interaction is generally irreversible. However, it has been shown that binding can be disrupted by chaotropic reagents, organic solvents, or even ultrasonic radiation.\n\nThe use of antibodies as the bio-recognition component of biosensors has several drawbacks. They have high molecular weights and limited stability, contain essential disulfide bonds and are expensive to produce. In one approach to overcome these limitations, recombinant binding fragments (Fab, Fv or scFv) or domains (VH, VHH) of antibodies have been engineered. In another approach, small protein scaffolds with favorable biophysical properties have been engineered to generate artificial families of Antigen Binding Proteins (AgBP), capable of specific binding to different target proteins while retaining the favorable properties of the parent molecule. The elements of the family that specifically bind to a given target antigen, are often selected in vitro by display techniques: phage display, ribosome display, yeast display or mRNA display. The artificial binding proteins are much smaller than antibodies (usually less than 100 amino-acid residues), have a strong stability, lack disulfide bonds and can be expressed in high yield in reducing cellular environments like the bacterial cytoplasm, contrary to antibodies and their derivatives. They are thus especially suitable to create biosensors.\n\nThe specific binding capabilities and catalytic activity of enzymes make them popular bioreceptors. Analyte recognition is enabled through several possible mechanisms: 1) the enzyme converting the analyte into a product that is sensor-detectable, 2) detecting enzyme inhibition or activation by the analyte, or 3) monitoring modification of enzyme properties resulting from interaction with the analyte. The main reasons for the common use of enzymes in biosensors are: 1) ability to catalyze a large number of reactions; 2) potential to detect a group of analytes (substrates, products, inhibitors, and modulators of the catalytic activity); and 3) suitability with several different transduction methods for detecting the analyte. Notably, since enzymes are not consumed in reactions, the biosensor can easily be used continuously. The catalytic activity of enzymes also allows lower limits of detection compared to common binding techniques. However, the sensor's lifetime is limited by the stability of the enzyme.\n\nAntibodies have a high binding constant in excess of 10^8 L/mol, which stands for a nearly irreversible association once the antigen-antibody couple has formed. For certain analyte molecules like glucose affinity binding proteins exist that bind their ligand with a high specificity like an antibody, but with a much smaller binding constant on the order of 10^2 to 10^4 L/mol. The association between analyte and receptor then is of reversible nature and next to the couple between both also their free molecules occur in a measurable concentration. In case of glucose, for instance, concanavalin A may function as affinity receptor exhibiting a binding constant of 4x10^2 L/mol. The use of affinity binding receptors for purposes of biosensing has been proposed by Schultz and Sims in 1979 and was subsequently configured into a fluorescent assay for measuring glucose in the relevant physiological range between 4.4 and 6.1 mmol/L. The sensor principle has the advantage that it does not consume the analyte in a chemical reaction as occurs in enzymatic assays.\n\nBiosensors that employ nucleic acid interactions can be referred to as genosensors. The recognition process is based on the principle of complementary base pairing, adenine:thymine and cytosine:guanine in DNA. If the target nucleic acid sequence is known, complementary sequences can be synthesized, labeled, and then immobilized on the sensor. The hybridization probes can then base pair with the target sequences, generating an optical signal. The favored transduction principle employed in this type of sensor has been optical detection.\n\nIt has been proposed that properly optimized integrated optical resonators can be exploited for detecting epigenetic modifications (e.g. DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications) in body fluids from patients affected by cancer or other diseases. Photonic biosensors with ultra-sensitivity are nowadays being developed at a research level to easily detect cancerous cells within the patient's urine. Different research projects aim to develop new portable devices that uses cheap, environmentally friendly, disposable cartridges that require only simple handling with no need of further processing, washing, or manipulation by expert technicians.\n\nOrganelles form separate compartments inside cells and usually perform function independently. Different kinds of organelles have various metabolic pathways and contain enzymes to fulfill its function. Commonly used organelles include lysosome, chloroplast and mitochondria. The spatial-temporal distribution pattern of calcium is closed related to ubiquitous signaling pathway. Mitochondria actively participate in the metabolism of calcium ions to control the function and also modulate the calcium related signaling pathways. Experiments have proved that mitochondria have the ability to respond to high calcium concentration generated in the proximity by opening the calcium channel. In this way, mitochondria can be used to detect the calcium concentration in medium and the detection is very sensitive due to high spatial resolution. Another application of mitochondria is used for detection of water pollution. Detergent compounds' toxicity will damage the cell and subcellular structure including mitochondria. The detergents will cause a swelling effect which could be measured by an absorbance change. Experiment data shows the change rate is proportional to the detergent concentration, providing a high standard for detection accuracy.\n\nCells are often used in bioreceptors because they are sensitive to surrounding environment and they can respond to all kinds of stimulants. Cells tend to attach to the surface so they can be easily immobilized. Compared to organelles they remain active for longer period and the reproducibility makes them reusable. They are commonly used to detect global parameter like stress condition, toxicity and organic derivatives. They can also be used to monitor the treatment effect of drugs. One application is to use cells to determine herbicides which are main aquatic contaminant. Microalgae are entrapped on a quartz microfiber and the chlorophyll fluorescence modified by herbicides is collected at the tip of an optical fiber bundle and transmitted to a fluorimeter. The algae are continuously cultured to get optimized measurement. Results show that detection limit of certain herbicide can reach sub-ppb concentration level. Some cells can also be used to monitor the microbial corrosion. Pseudomonas sp. is isolated from corroded material surface and immobilized on acetylcellulose membrane. The respiration activity is determined by measuring oxygen consumption. There is linear relationship between the current generated and the concentration of sulfuric acid. The response time is related to the loading of cells and surrounding environments and can be controlled to no more than 5min.\n\nTissues are used for biosensor for the abundance of enzymes existed. Advantages of tissues as biosensors include the following:\n\n\nThere also exist some disadvantages of tissues, like the lack of specificity due to the interference of other enzymes and longer response time due to transport barrier.\n\nAn important part in a biosensor is to attach the biological elements (small molecules/protein/cells) to the surface of the sensor (be it metal, polymer or glass). The simplest way is to functionalize the surface in order to coat it with the biological elements. This can be done by polylysine, aminosilane, epoxysilane or nitrocellulose in the case of silicon chips/silica glass. Subsequently, the bound biological agent may be for example fixed by Layer by layer depositation of alternatively charged polymer coatings.\n\nAlternatively three-dimensional lattices (hydrogel/xerogel) can be used to chemically or physically entrap these (where by chemically entraped it is meant that the biological element is kept in place by a strong bond, while physically they are kept in place being unable to pass through the pores of the gel matrix). The most commonly used hydrogel is sol-gel, a glassy silica generated by polymerization of silicate monomers (added as tetra alkyl orthosilicates, such as TMOS or TEOS) in the presence of the biological elements (along with other stabilizing polymers, such as PEG) in the case of physical entrapment.\n\nAnother group of hydrogels, which set under conditions suitable for cells or protein, are acrylate hydrogel, which polymerize upon radical initiation. One type of radical initiator is a peroxide radical, typically generated by combining a persulfate with TEMED (Polyacrylamide gel are also commonly used for protein electrophoresis), alternatively light can be used in combination with a photoinitiator, such as DMPA (2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone). Smart materials that mimic the biological components of a sensor can also be classified as biosensors using only the active or catalytic site or analogous configurations of a biomolecule.\n\nBiosensors can be classified by their biotransducer type. The most common types of biotransducers used in biosensors are:\n\n\nElectrochemical biosensors are normally based on enzymatic catalysis of a reaction that produces or consumes electrons (such enzymes are rightly called redox enzymes). The sensor substrate usually contains three electrodes; a reference electrode, a working electrode and a counter electrode. The target analyte is involved in the reaction that takes place on the active electrode surface, and the reaction may cause either electron transfer across the double layer (producing a current) or can contribute to the double layer potential (producing a voltage). We can either measure the current (rate of flow of electrons is now proportional to the analyte concentration) at a fixed potential or the potential can be measured at zero current (this gives a logarithmic response). Note that potential of the working or active electrode is space charge sensitive and this is often used. Further, the label-free and direct electrical detection of small peptides and proteins is possible by their intrinsic charges using biofunctionalized ion-sensitive field-effect transistors.\n\nAnother example, the potentiometric biosensor, (potential produced at zero current) gives a logarithmic response with a high dynamic range. Such biosensors are often made by screen printing the electrode patterns on a plastic substrate, coated with a conducting polymer and then some protein (enzyme or antibody) is attached. They have only two electrodes and are extremely sensitive and robust. They enable the detection of analytes at levels previously only achievable by HPLC and LC/MS and without rigorous sample preparation. All biosensors usually involve minimal sample preparation as the biological sensing component is highly selective for the analyte concerned. The signal is produced by electrochemical and physical changes in the conducting polymer layer due to changes occurring at the surface of the sensor. Such changes can be attributed to ionic strength, pH, hydration and redox reactions, the latter due to the enzyme label turning over a substrate. Field effect transistors, in which the gate region has been modified with an enzyme or antibody, can also detect very low concentrations of various analytes as the binding of the analyte to the gate region of the FET cause a change in the drain-source current.\n\nImpedance spectroscopy based biosensor development has been gaining traction nowadays and many such devices / developments are found in the academia and industry. One such device, based on a 4-electrode electrochemical cell, using a nanoporous alumina membrane, has been shown to detect low concentrations of human alpha thrombin in presence of high background of serum albumin. \n\nThe use of ion channels has been shown to offer highly sensitive detection \nof target biological molecules. By embedding the ion channels in supported or tethered bilayer membranes (t-BLM) attached to a gold electrode, an electrical circuit is created. Capture molecules such as antibodies can be bound to the ion channel so that the binding of the target molecule controls the ion flow through the channel. This results in a measurable change in the electrical conduction which is proportional to the concentration of the target.\n\nAn ion channel switch (ICS) biosensor can be created using gramicidin, a dimeric peptide channel, in a tethered bilayer membrane. One peptide of gramicidin, with attached antibody, is mobile and one is fixed. Breaking the dimer stops the ionic current through the membrane. The magnitude of the change in electrical signal is greatly increased by separating the membrane from the metal surface using a hydrophilic spacer.\n\nQuantitative detection of an extensive class of target species, including proteins, bacteria, drug and toxins has been demonstrated using different membrane and capture configurations.\n\nA reagentless biosensor can monitor a target analyte in a complex biological mixture without additional reagent. Therefore, it can function continuously if immobilized on a solid support. A fluorescent biosensor reacts to the interaction with its target analyte by a change of its fluorescence properties. A Reagentless Fluorescent biosensor (RF biosensor) can be obtained by integrating a biological receptor, which is directed against the target analyte, and a solvatochromic fluorophore, whose emission properties are sensitive to the nature of its local environment, in a single macromolecule. The fluorophore transduces the recognition event into a measurable optical signal. The use of extrinsic fluorophores, whose emission properties differ widely from those of the intrinsic fluorophores of proteins, tryptophan and tyrosine, enables one to immediately detect and quantify the analyte in complex biological mixtures. The integration of the fluorophore must be done in a site where it is sensitive to the binding of the analyte without perturbing the affinity of the receptor.\n\nAntibodies and artificial families of Antigen Binding Proteins (AgBP) are well suited to provide the recognition module of RF biosensors since they can be directed against any antigen (see the paragraph on bioreceptors). A general approach to integrate a solvatochromic fluorophore in an AgBP when the atomic structure of the complex with its antigen is known, and thus transform it into a RF biosensor, has been described. A residue of the AgBP is identified in the neighborhood of the antigen in their complex. This residue is changed into a cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis. The fluorophore is chemically coupled to the mutant cysteine. When the design is successful, the coupled fluorophore does not prevent the binding of the antigen, this binding shields the fluorophore from the solvent, and it can be detected by a change of fluorescence. This strategy is also valid for antibody fragments.\n\nHowever, in the absence of specific structural data, other strategies must be applied. Antibodies and artificial families of AgBPs are constituted by a set of hypervariable (or randomized) residue positions, located in a unique sub-region of the protein, and supported by a constant polypeptide scaffold. The residues that form the binding site for a given antigen, are selected among the hypervariable residues. It is possible to transform any AgBP of these families into a RF biosensor, specific of the target antigen, simply by coupling a solvatochromic fluorophore to one of the hypervariable residues that have little or no importance for the interaction with the antigen, after changing this residue into cysteine by mutagenesis. More specifically, the strategy consists in individually changing the residues of the hypervariable positions into cysteine at the genetic level, in chemically coupling a solvatochromic fluorophore with the mutant cysteine, and then in keeping the resulting conjugates that have the highest sensitivity (a parameter that involves both affinity and variation of fluorescence signal). This approach is also valid for families of antibody fragments.\n\nA posteriori studies have shown that the best reagentless fluorescent biosensors are obtained when the fluorophore does not make non-covalent interactions with the surface of the bioreceptor, which would increase the background signal, and when it interacts with a binding pocket at the surface of the target antigen. The RF biosensors that are obtained by the above methods, can function and detect target analytes inside living cells.\n\nPiezoelectric sensors utilise crystals which undergo an elastic deformation when an electrical potential is applied to them. An alternating potential (A.C.) produces a standing wave in the crystal at a characteristic frequency. This frequency is highly dependent on the elastic properties of the crystal, such that if a crystal is coated with a biological recognition element the binding of a (large) target analyte to a receptor will produce a change in the resonance frequency, which gives a binding signal. In a mode that uses surface acoustic waves (SAW), the sensitivity is greatly increased. This is a specialised application of the quartz crystal microbalance as a biosensor\n\nElectrochemiluminescence (ECL) is nowadays a leading technique in biosensors. Since the excited species are produced with an electrochemical stimulus rather than with a light excitation source, ECL displays improved signal-to-noise ratio compared to photoluminescence, with minimized effects due to light scattering and luminescence background. In particular, coreactant ECL operating in buffered aqueous solution in the region of positive potentials (oxidative-reduction mechanism) definitively boosted ECL for immunoassay, as confirmed by many research applications and, even more, by the presence of important companies which developed commercial hardware for high throughput immunoassays analysis in a market worth billions of dollars each year.\n\nThermometric and magnetic based biosensors are rare.\n\nThe appropriate placement of biosensors depends on their field of application, which may roughly be divided into biotechnology, agriculture, food technology and biomedicine.\n\nIn biotechnology, analysis of the chemical composition of cultivation broth can be conducted in-line, on-line, at-line and off-line. As outlined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the sample is not removed from the process stream for in-line sensors, while it is diverted from the manufacturing process for on-line measurements. For at-line sensors the sample may be removed and analyzed in close proximity to the process stream. An example of the latter is the monitoring of lactose in a dairy processing plant. Off-line biosensors compare to bioanalytical techniques that are not operating in the field, but in the laboratory. These techniques are mainly used in agriculture, food technology and biomedicine.\n\nIn medical applications biosensors are generally categorized as \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\" systems. An \"in vitro\", biosensor measurement takes place in a test tube, a culture dish, a microtiter plate or elsewhere outside a living organism. The sensor uses a bioreceptor and transducer as outlined above. An example of an \"in vitro\" biosensor is an enzyme-conductimetric biosensor for blood glucose monitoring. There is a challenge to create a biosensor that operates by the principle of point-of-care testing, i.e. at the location where the test is needed. Development of wearable biosensors is among such studies. The elimination of lab testing can save time and money. An application of a POCT biosensor can be for the testing of HIV in areas where it is difficult for patients to be tested. A biosensor can be sent directly to the location and a quick and easy test can be used. \nAn \"in vivo\" biosensor is an implantable device that operates inside the body. Of course, biosensor implants have to fulfill the strict regulations on sterilization in order to avoid an initial inflammatory response after implantation. The second concern relates to the long-term biocompatibility, i.e. the unharmful interaction with the body environment during the intended period of use. Another issue that arises is failure. If there is failure, the device must be removed and replaced, causing additional surgery. An example for application of an in vivo biosensor would be the insulin monitoring within the body, which is not available yet.\n\nMost advanced biosensor implants have been developed for the continuous monitoring of glucose. The figure displays a device, for which a Ti casing and a battery as established for cardiovascular implants like pacemakers and defibrillators is used. Its size is determined by the battery as required for a lifetime of one year. Measured glucose data will be transmitted wirelessly out of the body within the MICS 402-405 MHz band as approved for medical implants.\n\nBiosensors can also be integrated into mobile phone systems, making them user-friendly and accessible to a large amount of users.\n\nThere are many potential applications of biosensors of various types. The main requirements for a biosensor approach to be valuable in terms of research and commercial applications are the identification of a target molecule, availability of a suitable biological recognition element, and the potential for disposable portable detection systems to be preferred to sensitive laboratory-based techniques in some situations. Some examples are glucose monitoring in diabetes patients, other medical health related targets, environmental applications e.g. the detection of pesticides and river water contaminants such as heavy metal ions, remote sensing of airborne bacteria e.g. in counter-bioterrorist activities, remote sensing of water quality in coastal waters by describing online different aspects of clam ethology (biological rhythms, growth rates, spawning or death records) in groups of abandoned bivalves around the world, detection of pathogens, determining levels of toxic substances before and after bioremediation, detection and determining of organophosphate, routine analytical measurement of folic acid, biotin, vitamin B12 and pantothenic acid as an alternative to microbiological assay, determination of drug residues in food, such as antibiotics and growth promoters, particularly meat and honey, drug discovery and evaluation of biological activity of new compounds, protein engineering in biosensors, and detection of toxic metabolites such as mycotoxins.\n\nA common example of a commercial biosensor is the blood glucose biosensor, which uses the enzyme glucose oxidase to break blood glucose down. In doing so it first oxidizes glucose and uses two electrons to reduce the FAD (a component of the enzyme) to FADH2. This in turn is oxidized by the electrode in a number of steps. The resulting current is a measure of the concentration of glucose. In this case, the electrode is the transducer and the enzyme is the biologically active component.\n\nA canary in a cage, as used by miners to warn of gas, could be considered a biosensor. Many of today's biosensor applications are similar, in that they use organisms which respond to toxic substances at a much lower concentrations than humans can detect to warn of their presence. Such devices can be used in environmental monitoring, trace gas detection and in water treatment facilities.\n\nMany optical biosensors are based on the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques. This utilises a property of and other materials; specifically that a thin layer of gold on a high refractive index glass surface can absorb laser light, producing electron waves (surface plasmons) on the gold surface. This occurs only at a specific angle and wavelength of incident light and is highly dependent on the surface of the gold, such that binding of a target analyte to a receptor on the gold surface produces a measurable signal.\n\nSurface plasmon resonance sensors operate using a sensor chip consisting of a plastic cassette supporting a glass plate, one side of which is coated with a microscopic layer of gold. This side contacts the optical detection apparatus of the instrument. The opposite side is then contacted with a microfluidic flow system. The contact with the flow system creates channels across which reagents can be passed in solution. This side of the glass sensor chip can be modified in a number of ways, to allow easy attachment of molecules of interest. Normally it is coated in carboxymethyl dextran or similar compound.\n\nThe refractive index at the flow side of the chip surface has a direct influence on the behavior of the light reflected off the gold side. Binding to the flow side of the chip has an effect on the refractive index and in this way biological interactions can be measured to a high degree of sensitivity with some sort of energy. The refractive index of the medium near the surface changes when biomolecules attach to the surface, and the SPR angle varies as a function of this change.\n\nLight of a fixed wavelength is reflected off the gold side of the chip at the angle of total internal reflection, and detected inside the instrument. The angle of incident light is varied in order to match the evanescent wave propagation rate with the propagation rate of the surface plasmon plaritons. This induces the evanescent wave to penetrate through the glass plate and some distance into the liquid flowing over the surface.\n\nOther optical biosensors are mainly based on changes in absorbance or fluorescence of an appropriate indicator compound and do not need a total internal reflection geometry. For example, a fully operational prototype device detecting casein in milk has been fabricated. The device is based on detecting changes in absorption of a gold layer. A widely used research tool, the micro-array, can also be considered a biosensor.\n\nBiological biosensors often incorporate a genetically modified form of a native protein or enzyme. The protein is configured to detect a specific analyte and the ensuing signal is read by a detection instrument such as a fluorometer or luminometer. An example of a recently developed biosensor is one for detecting cytosolic concentration of the analyte cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), a second messenger involved in cellular signaling triggered by ligands interacting with receptors on the cell membrane. Similar systems have been created to study cellular responses to native ligands or xenobiotics (toxins or small molecule inhibitors). Such \"assays\" are commonly used in drug discovery development by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Most cAMP assays in current use require lysis of the cells prior to measurement of cAMP. A live-cell biosensor for cAMP can be used in non-lysed cells with the additional advantage of multiple reads to study the kinetics of receptor response.\n\nNanobiosensors use an immobilized bioreceptor probe that is selective for target analyte molecules. Nanomaterials are exquisitely sensitive chemical and biological sensors. Nanoscale materials demonstrate unique properties. Their large surface area to volume ratio can achieve rapid and low cost reactions, using a variety of designs.\n\nOther evanescent wave biosensors have been commercialised using waveguides where the propagation constant through the waveguide is changed by the absorption of molecules to the waveguide surface. One such example, dual polarisation interferometry uses a buried waveguide as a reference against which the change in propagation constant is measured. Other configurations such as the Mach–Zehnder have reference arms lithographically defined on a substrate. Higher levels of integration can be achieved using resonator geometries where the resonant frequency of a ring resonator changes when molecules are absorbed.\n\nRecently, arrays of many different detector molecules have been applied in so called electronic nose devices, where the pattern of response from the detectors is used to fingerprint a substance. In the Wasp Hound odor-detector, the mechanical element is a video camera and the biological element is five parasitic wasps who have been conditioned to swarm in response to the presence of a specific chemical. Current commercial electronic noses, however, do not use biological elements.\n\nCommercially available glucose monitors rely on amperometric sensing of glucose by means of glucose oxidase, which oxidises glucose producing hydrogen peroxide which is detected by the electrode. To overcome the limitation of amperometric sensors, a flurry of research is present into novel sensing methods, such as fluorescent glucose biosensors.\n\nThe interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (IRIS) is based on the principles of optical interference and consists of a silicon-silicon oxide substrate, standard optics, and low-powered coherent LEDs. When light is illuminated through a low magnification objective onto the layered silicon-silicon oxide substrate, an interferometric signature is produced. As biomass, which has a similar index of refraction as silicon oxide, accumulates on the substrate surface, a change in the interferometric signature occurs and the change can be correlated to a quantifiable mass. \"Daaboul et al.\" used IRIS to yield a label-free sensitivity of approximately 19 ng/mL. \"Ahn et al.\" improved the sensitivity of IRIS through a mass tagging technique.\n\nSince initial publication, IRIS has been adapted to perform various functions. First, IRIS integrated a fluorescence imaging capability into the interferometric imaging instrument as a potential way to address fluorescence protein microarray variability. Briefly, the variation in fluorescence microarrays mainly derives from inconsistent protein immobilization on surfaces and may cause misdiagnoses in allergy microarrays. To correct from any variation in protein immobilization, data acquired in the fluorescence modality is then normalized by the data acquired in the label-free modality. IRIS has also been adapted to perform single nanoparticle counting by simply switching the low magnification objective used for label-free biomass quantification to a higher objective magnification. This modality enables size discrimination in complex human biological samples. \"Monroe et al.\" used IRIS to quantify protein levels spiked into human whole blood and serum and determined allergen sensitization in characterized human blood samples using zero sample processing. Other practical uses of this device include virus and pathogen detection.\n\nThere are several applications of biosensors in food analysis. In the food industry, optics coated with antibodies are commonly used to detect pathogens and food toxins. Commonly, the light system in these biosensors is fluorescence, since this type of optical measurement can greatly amplify the signal.\n\nA range of immuno- and ligand-binding assays for the detection and measurement of small molecules such as water-soluble vitamins and chemical contaminants (drug residues) such as sulfonamides and Beta-agonists have been developed for use on SPR based sensor systems, often adapted from existing ELISA or other immunological assay. These are in widespread use across the food industry.\n\nIn the future, DNA will find use as a versatile material from which scientists can craft biosensors. DNA biosensors can theoretically be used for medical diagnostics, forensic science, agriculture, or even environmental clean-up efforts. No external monitoring is needed for DNA-based sensing devises. This is a significant advantage. DNA biosensors are complicated mini-machines—consisting of sensing elements, micro lasers, and a signal generator. At the heart of DNA biosensor function is the fact that two strands of DNA stick to each other by virtue of chemical attractive forces. On such a sensor, only an exact fit—that is, two strands that match up at every nucleotide position—gives rise to a fluorescent signal (a glow) that is then transmitted to a signal generator.\n\nUsing biological engineering researchers have created many microbial biosensors. An example is the arsenic biosensor. To detect arsenic they use the Ars operon. Using bacteria, researchers can detect pollutants in samples.\n\nBecause ozone filters out harmful ultraviolet radiation, the discovery of holes in the ozone layer of the earth's atmosphere has raised concern about how much ultraviolet light reaches the earth's surface. Of particular concern are the questions of how deeply into sea water ultraviolet radiation penetrates and how it affects marine organisms, especially plankton (floating microorganisms) and viruses that attack plankton. Plankton form the base of the marine food chains and are believed to affect our planet's temperature and weather by uptake of CO for photosynthesis.\n\nDeneb Karentz, a researcher at the Laboratory of Radio-biology and Environmental Health (University of California, San Francisco) has devised a simple method for measuring ultraviolet penetration and intensity. Working in the Antarctic Ocean, she submerged to various depths thin plastic bags containing special strains of \"E. coli\" that are almost totally unable to repair ultraviolet radiation damage to their DNA. Bacterial death rates in these bags were compared with rates in unexposed control bags of the same organism. The bacterial \"biosensors\" revealed constant significant ultraviolet damage at depths of 10 m and frequently at 20 and 30 m. Karentz plans additional studies of how ultraviolet may affect seasonal plankton blooms (growth spurts) in the oceans.\n\nMetastasis is the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another via either the circulatory system or lymphatic system. Unlike radiology imaging tests (mammograms), which send forms of energy (x-rays, magnetic fields, etc.) through the body to only take interior pictures, biosensors have the potential to directly test the malignant power of the tumor. The combination of a biological and detector element allows for a small sample requirement, a compact design, rapid signals, rapid detection, high selectivity and high sensitivity for the analyte being studied. Compared to the usual radiology imaging tests biosensors have the advantage of not only finding out how far the cancer has spread and checking if treatment is effective, but also are cheaper, more efficient (in time, cost and productivity) ways to assess metastaticity in early stages of cancer.\n\nBiological engineering researchers have created oncological biosensors for breast cancer. Breast cancer is the leading common cancer among women worldwide. An example would be a transferrin- quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). As a biosensor, quartz crystal microbalances produce oscillations in the frequency of the crystal’s standing wave from an alternating potential to detect nano-gram mass changes. These biosensors are specifically designed to interact and have high selectivity for receptors on cell (cancerous and normal) surfaces. Ideally this provides a quantitative detection of cells with this receptor per surface area instead of a qualitative picture detection given by mammograms.\n\nSeda Atay, a biotechnology researcher at Hacettepe University, experimentally observed this specificity and selectivity between a QCM and MDA-MB 231 breast cells, MCF 7 cells, and starved MDA-MB 231 cells in vitro. With other researchers she devised a method of washing these different metastatic leveled cells over the sensors to measure mass shifts due to different quantities of transferrin receptors. Particularly, the metastatic power of breast cancer cells can be determined by Quartz crystal microbalances with nanoparticles and transferrin that would potentially attach to transferrin receptors on cancer cell surfaces. There is very high selectivity for transferrin receptors because they are over-expressed in cancer cells. If cells have high expression of transferrin receptors, which shows their high metastatic power, they have higher affinity and bind more to the QCM that measures the increase in mass. Depending on the magnitude of the nano-gram mass change, the metastatic power can be determined.\n\nWhen nanoparticles are attached to the QCM surface their simplicity, variability in shape, high surface area, physicochemical malleability, and optional attachment of metals enables for different properties, a change in responses, selectivities and specificities. This transducer’s characteristics in combination with nanoparticles with large surface area to volume ratios makes it a perfect biosensor to particularly determine the metastatic power and malignancy of cancer cells. In Seda Atay’s study, determining the metastatic power of in vitro breast cancer exactly required 58 nm sized Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) nanoparticles with a surface area of 1899 m2g-1 to effectively adsorb the cells to the QCM surface.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30357748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30357748", "title": "Combrex", "text": "Combrex\n\nCOMBREX is a multifaceted project that includes a database of gene annotations, functional predictions and recommendations based on Active Learning principles associated with millions of genes in prokaryotic genomes.\n\nCOMBREX is a multifaceted project that aims to bring together the computational and experimental communities of biologists in the interest of improving our understanding of microbial gene function and accelerating the annotation of microbial gene function. The COMBREX project was co-founded by Simon Kasif, Richard Roberts and Martin Steffen as an international consortium with a headquarters at Boston University and over 100 experimental and computational collaborators. The project was inspired by a call for community action published in PLoS Biology by Richard J. Roberts.\n\nThis evolving database consists of experimentally determined and computationally predicted functions for more than three million microbial genes. Searching for a gene or genes of interest may be an end in itself, or it may be a first step toward contributing information to or seeking a grant from COMBREX. The database presently consists of genes from over 1000 completely sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes, supplemented with a number of individual genes whose biochemical function has been experimentally determined. The genes are organized into sequence-similar, and likely isofunctional, groups determined by NCBI, referred to as Protein Clusters.\n\nA color-coding system is used to identify which genes have experimentally determined functions, which have computationally predicted functions, and which have no known or predicted function (info). By necessity, \"predicted functions\" may encompass a broad range of specificity, and one of our longer range goals is to quantify this specificity. (For example, the predicted function \"valine decarboxylase\" is significantly more specific, and more readily verifiable, than \"lyase\", or even \"carboxy-lyase\".)\n\nIdentification of genes whose products have been experimentally verified is also not a trivial task, and so we have embarked on a project to create a comprehensive, manually curated set of all such genes, which we refer to as the Gold Standard Gene Database. This curated set is at present unique to the COMBREX database, and genes belonging to it are color-coded with a gold symbol.\n\nThe COMBREX database serves as a venue for computational biologists to publicize their most informative gene function predictions. A major effort within the bio-informatics field has been the computational prediction of gene function. There have been significant advances in this field over the last decade or so, but many of these efforts have not realized their full potential to advance biological knowledge due to the fact that predictions are rarely experimentally tested, and predicted functions for individual genes made by competing methods are rarely directly compared.\n\nThe COMBREX database, besides drawing information from familiar sources such as NCBI and UniProtKB, also displays gene function predictions submitted by individual laboratories. Such predictions may be generated in large scale using computational algorithms, or may be made for individual genes by experimental or computational biologists well acquainted with a particular protein family or biochemical pathway. Thus, predictions made by different methods may be easily compared, contrasted, and examined by experimental biologists. This side-by-side display of function predictions from many sources is the heart of the interaction between computational and experimental communities that COMBREX hopes to foster.\n\nCOMBREX uses simple principles as well as more sophisticated Active Learning methodologies to recommend the most informative experiments. These are experiments that are most likely to generate the most informative (in the mathematical sense of maximizing information gain) predictions for the largest number of proteins in the database. The most basic recommendations provide ranking of all proteins in a gene cluster in terms of their distance to other proteins. In the simplest case proteins near the center of a cluster are judged to be most informative because their distance to the other proteins in the cluster is relatively small. As a result, functional annotation of a \"center\" of a cluster is likely to result in the most accurate predictions for the other proteins in the cluster. In evolutionary terms these \"cluster centers\" are closest to the evolutionary ancestor of all the proteins in the cluster. Active Learning generalizes this intuition principle to produce recommendations for additional experiments that are likely to either produce accurate predictions or identify proteins that are not annotated correctly.\n\nIn addition to evolutionary analysis and Active Learning COMBREX also points to other criteria that might be considered in considering experiments. Such criteria include whether there is a structure available, conservation of the bacterial gene in the human genome (e.g. domain sharing), availability of computational or experimental evidence of gene function, phenotypical considerations (such as presence in a pathogen or relation to antibiotic resistance, pathogenicity or virulence)and others.\n\nOne of the missions of COMBREX is to issue small monetary grants for the experimental validation of specific gene predictions. The experimental determination of biochemical function for specific gene products serves to validate (or invalidate) the computational predictions made a priori. Thus, this experimental effort serves three goals: (1) it brings together directly the scientists who make gene function predictions and those who test them, (2) it evaluates computational methods based on how accurate their predictions are so they can be improved, and (3) it broadens the landscape of experimentally validated genes, improving our overall understanding of biology and of sequence-structure-function relationships.\n\nThe experimental investigation of the biochemical function of a single gene or small number of genes is often beneath the purview of large funding agencies. COMBREX is set up to issue small grants for exactly this type of work, and such grants are particularly suited for laboratories already familiar with the types of assays required for the intended experiments.\n\nOne of the current problems with gene and genome annotation is a lack of transparency with respect to source. It is often difficult to determine which functions have been determined experimentally and which are predicted computationally. Furthermore, for computationally predicted functions, the method used to make the prediction and the strength of the evidence are rarely stated. COMBREX has taken the first steps toward a more transparent system of annotation by (1) color-coding genes to distinguish observed from predicted functions, and (2) for many functions predicted by sequence similarity, identifying the experimentally validated \"source gene\" on which the prediction was based.\n\nCOMBREX is working towards a more completely traceable annotation system, in which every stated functional annotation is either experimentally determined, or is a prediction explicitly linked through a chain of evidence to an ultimate source of information. These sources will in many cases be experimentally validated genes, but in some cases will be annotations from existing databases whose sources are themselves not immediately apparent.\n\nCOMBREX is the first database that attempts to \"computationally\" identify the link to the experimental source of an annotation using homology. Other databases provide two types of evidence, e.g. inferred directly from experiments or inferred computationally. However, the inference cannot be typically traced to the experimental source of the annotation. COMBREX cannot guarantee that the \"traces\" it provides are accurate at this point but it enables biologists to make this determination directly by examining the link.\n\nThis system of identifying source genes and functions, and evidential links, will enable a dynamic system of annotation that is automatically updated as experimental evidence for new genes is determined, and as new predictive methods are developed. Such a dynamic system of gene functional annotation may help overcome the relatively high frequency of unannotated and misannotated genes that results from the static system used in many public databases. Furthermore, it will illuminate those genes whose biochemical functions are truly unknown, as opposed to those that are simply insufficiently annotated.\n\nMaking gene functional predictions transparent is important, but equally important is making them as accurate as possible. Predictions need to be commensurate with the strength of evidence for them, such that they are as specific as the evidence will allow. Those that are not specific enough do not lend themselves to experimental testing, and those that are too specific for the underlying evidence run a high risk of being inaccurate. COMBREX is actively working on developing algorithms for functional prediction that can identify genes with novel or interesting functions, and whose results can sit beside the high-quality predictions received from collaborating computational groups. COMBREX's relatively conservative BLAST-based propagation of gene function represents a simple first step towards this goal.\n\nThrough its funding decisions, COMBREX can help broaden as well as deepen our understanding of biochemical gene function by encouraging experimental investigation of specific genes. The choice of which genes to validate is an important one: little overall new knowledge is gained by validating closely similar relatives of isofunctional genes, and validating experiments for genes with no specific predicted functions are unlikely to succeed. Furthermore, the landscape of what is already known is uneven, with many validated examples of some functions and few or no examples of others.\n\nCOMBREX wishes to develop a new, integrative model of research in which experiments are prioritized to close the largest gaps in our overall predictive understanding of gene function. Such a model favors the validation of genes that provide relatively large increases in knowledge, for example because their validated function results in a large number of new predictions for other genes. At an early stage COMBREX will introduce lists of \"high priority\" genes, which may be identified as being of significant predictive or biomedical value, and to which COMBREX members may nominate candidates. As a longer-term goal, COMBREX is working towards the use of machine learning techniques such as active learning to optimize the selection of such genes.\n\nFinally, COMBREX encourages the development of new technologies and cost-effective assays for gene function determination. The experimental validation effort described above amounts to a massively parallel application of low-throughput experiments via many small-scale grants. High-throughput assays that can analyze many gene products in parallel may result in the determination of function for many genes simultaneously, and may help make large strides in our overall understanding of gene function.\n\n"}

He flew for Cathay Pacific from 1989 until his death in 2005. Before flying for Cathay Pacific he flew for Missionary Aviation Fellowship in Papua New Guinea and Tanzania. He also flew agricultural aircraft in South Australia and New South Wales.\n\nShaw's first rebreather was an Inspiration closed circuit rebreather, which he eventually dived to depths beyond the unit's supposed capability. That prompted him to purchase a Mk15.5, which he modified by removing the analogue electronics and replacing them with the Juergensen Marine Hammerhead digital electronics, in a specially modified POD designed to handle extreme pressures. The Mk15.5 was his rebreather of choice for dives deeper than . Shaw also owned a Cis-Lunar Mk5P that he used on extended dives in caves shallower than 150 m. He believed the Cis-Lunar had greater redundancy capabilities for such dives but could not cope with extreme depths.\n\nOn 28 October 2004, Shaw broke the following records at Bushman's Hole, South Africa:\nHe used a Mk15.5 with Juergensen Marine Hammerhead electronics and the following gas mixtures: trimix 4/80, 10/70, 15/55, 17/40, 26/25, air, nitrox50, 100% oxygen. The cave elevation was and the dive duration was 9 hours 40 minutes.\n\nOn this record-breaking dive, Shaw discovered the body of Deon Dreyer, a South African diver who had died in Bushman's Hole ten years previously. The body was at a depth of .\n\nShaw died on 8 January 2005 while seeking to recover the body of Deon Dreyer.\n\nShaw recorded his dive with an underwater camera, which allowed researchers to determine that he suffered from respiratory issues due to the high pressure. Shaw ran into difficulties when he cut loose Dreyer's harness and the body unexpectedly began to float. Shaw had been advised by various experts that the body would remain negatively buoyant because the visible parts were reduced to the skeleton. However, within his wetsuit, Dreyer's corpse had turned into a soap-like substance called adipocere, which floats. Shaw had been working with both hands, and so had been resting his can light on the cave floor. The powerful underwater lights that cave divers use are connected by wires to heavy battery canisters, normally worn on the cave diver's waist, or sometimes attached to their tanks. Normally he would have wrapped the wire behind his neck, but he was unable to do so; the lines from the body bag appear to have become entangled with the light head, and the physical effort of trying to free himself led to his death. Three days later, both of the bodies floated up to near the surface as the dive team was retrieving their equipment.\n\nThe dive on which Shaw died was the 333rd dive of his career. At the time of his world record setting dive, he had been diving for just over five years.\n\nShaw was a devout Christian. He and his wife, Ann, lived in Hong Kong, where they were members of a small Christian congregation. They have two children, Steven Shaw and Lisa Shaw (now Lisa Moyers).\n"}

{"id": "14084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14084", "title": "Heterosexuality", "text": "Heterosexuality\n\nHeterosexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior between persons of the opposite sex or gender. As a sexual orientation, heterosexuality is \"an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions\" to persons of the opposite sex; it \"also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.\"\n\nAlong with bisexuality and homosexuality, heterosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation within the heterosexual–homosexual continuum. Someone who is heterosexual is commonly referred to as \"straight.\"\n\nThe term \"heterosexual\" or \"heterosexuality\" is usually applied to humans, but heterosexual behavior is observed in all mammals and in other animals.\n\n\"Hetero-\" comes from the Greek word \"ἕτερος\" [héteros], meaning \"other party\" or \"another\", used in science as a prefix meaning \"different\"; and the Latin word for sex (that is, characteristic sex or sexual differentiation). The term \"heterosexual\" was first published in 1892 in C.G. Chaddock's translation of Krafft-Ebing's \"Psychopathia Sexualis\". The noun came into use from the early 1920s, but did not enter common use until the 1960s. The colloquial shortening \"hetero\" is attested from 1933. The abstract noun \"heterosexuality\" is first recorded in 1900. The word \"heterosexual\" was first listed in Merriam-Webster's \"New International Dictionary\" as a medical term for \"morbid sexual passion for one of the opposite sex\"; however, in 1934 in their \"Second Edition Unabridged\" it is defined as a \"manifestation of sexual passion for one of the opposite sex; normal sexuality\".\nThe adjective \"heterosexual\" is used for intimate relationships or sexual relations between male and female.\n\nThe current use of the term \"heterosexual\" has its roots in the broader 19th century tradition of personality taxonomy. It continues to influence the development of the modern concept of sexual orientation, and can be used to describe individuals' sexual orientation, sexual history, or self-identification. Some reject the term \"heterosexual\", as they feel that the word only refers to one's sexual behavior and does not refer to non-sexual romantic feelings. The term \"heterosexual\" is suggested to have come into use as a neologism after, and opposite to, the word \"homosexual\" by Karl Maria Kertbeny in 1868. In LGBT slang, the term \"breeder\" has been used as a denigrating phrase to deride heterosexuals. Hyponyms of heterosexual include \"heteroflexible\".\n\nThe word can be informally shortened to \"hetero\". The term \"straight\" originated as a mid-20th century gay slang term for heterosexuals, ultimately coming from the phrase \"to go straight\" (as in \"straight and narrow\"), or stop engaging in homosexual sex. One of the first uses of the word in this way was in 1941 by author G. W. Henry. Henry's book concerned conversations with homosexual males and used this term in connection with people who are identified as ex-gays. It is now simply a colloquial term for \"heterosexual\", having changed in primary meaning over time. Some object to usage of the term \"straight\" because it implies that non-heteros are crooked.\n\nHeterosexual symbolism dates back to the earliest artifacts of humanity, with gender symbols, ritual fertility carvings, and primitive art. This was later expressed in the symbolism of fertility rites and polytheistic worship, which often included images of human reproductive organs, such as lingam in Hinduism. Modern symbols of heterosexuality in societies derived from European traditions still reference symbols used in these ancient beliefs. One such image is a combination of the symbol for Mars, the Roman god of war, as the definitive male symbol of masculinity, and Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty, as the definitive female symbol of femininity. The unicode character for this combined symbol is ⚤ (U+26A4).\n\nThe Judeo-Christian tradition has several scriptures related to heterosexuality. The Genesis states that God created man because \"it is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.\" () Genesis then contains a commandment stating \"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh\" () In 1 Corinthians, Christians are advised:\n\nFor the most part, religious traditions in the world reserve marriage to heterosexual unions, but there are exceptions including certain Buddhist and Hindu traditions, Unitarian Universalist, Metropolitan Community Church and some Anglican dioceses and some Quaker, United Church of Canada and Reform and Conservative Jewish congregations.\n\nAlmost all religions believe that lawful sex between a man and a woman is allowed, but there are a few that believe that it is a sin, such as The Shakers, The Harmony Society, and The Ephrata Cloister. These religions tend to view all sexual relations as sinful, and promote celibacy. Other religions view heterosexual relationships as being inferior to celibacy. Some religions require celibacy for certain roles, such as Catholic priests; however, the Catholic Church also views heterosexual marriage as sacred and necessary.\n\nThe demographics of sexual orientation are difficult to establish due to a lack of reliable data. However, the history of human sexuality shows that attitudes and behavior have varied across societies. According to major studies, 89% to 98% of people have had only heterosexual contact within their lifetime; but this percentage falls to 79–84% when either or both same-sex attraction and behavior are reported. In a 2006 study, 80% of respondents anonymously reported heterosexual feelings, although 97–98% identified themselves as heterosexual. A 1992 study reported that 93.9% of males in Britain have always had heterosexual experience, while in France the number was reported at 95.9%.\n\nIn the United States, according to a Williams Institute report in April 2011, 96% or approximately 250 million of the adult population are heterosexual.\n\nAccording to a 2008 poll, 85% of Britons have only opposite-sex sexual contact while only 94% of Britons identify themselves as heterosexual. Similarly, a survey by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) in 2010 found that 95% of Britons identified as heterosexual, 1.5% of Britons identified themselves as homosexual or bisexual, and the last 3.5% gave more vague answers such as \"don't know\", \"other\", or did not respond to the question.\n\nAn October 2012 Gallup poll provided unprecedented demographic information about those who identify as heterosexual, arriving at the conclusion that 96.6%, with a margin of error of ±1%, of all U.S. adults identify as heterosexual.\n\nIn a 2015 Yougov survey of 1,632 adults of the United Kingdom, 88.7% identified as heterosexual, 5.5% as homosexual and 2.1% as bisexual. Asked to place themselves on the Kinsey scale, 72% of all adults, and 46% of adults aged 18–24 years, picked a score of zero, meaning that they identify as totally heterosexual. 4% of the total sample, and 6% of young adults, picked a score of six, meaning a totally homosexual identity.\n\nIn another Yougov survey of 1,000 adults of the United States, 89% of the sample identified as heterosexual, 4% as homosexual (among 2% as homosexual male and 2% as homosexual female) and 4% as bisexual (of either sex).\n\nThe relationship between biology and sexual orientation is a subject of research. No simple and singular determinant for sexual orientation has been conclusively demonstrated; various studies point to different, even conflicting positions, but scientists hypothesize that a combination of genetic, hormonal, and social factors determine sexual orientation. Biological theories for explaining the causes of sexual orientation are more popular, and biological factors may involve a complex interplay of genetic factors and the early uterine environment, or biological and social factors. These factors, which may be related to the development of heterosexual or other orientation, include genes, prenatal hormones, and brain structure and their interaction with the environment.\n\nThe neurobiology of the masculinization of the brain is fairly well understood. Estradiol and testosterone, which is catalyzed by the enzyme 5α-reductase into dihydrotestosterone, act upon androgen receptors in the brain to masculinize it. If there are few androgen receptors (people with androgen insensitivity syndrome) or too much androgen (females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia), there can be physical and psychological effects. It has been suggested that both male and female heterosexuality are results of variation in this process. In these studies heterosexuality in females is linked to a lower amount of masculinization than is found in lesbian females, though when dealing with male heterosexuality there are results supporting both higher and lower degrees of masculinization than homosexual males.\n\nMost sexual reproduction in the animal world is facilitated through opposite-sex sexual activity, although there are also animals that reproduce asexually, including protozoa and lower invertebrates.\n\nReproductive sex does not necessarily require a heterosexual orientation, since orientation refers to a long-term enduring pattern of sexual and emotional attraction leading often to long-term social bonding, while reproductive sex requires only the basic act of intercourse only to fertile the ovum by sperm, often done one time only.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, early theoretical discussions in the field of psychoanalysis posited original bisexuality in human psychological development. Quantitative studies by Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s and Dr. Fritz Klein's sexual orientation grid in the 1980s find distributions similar to those postulated by their predecessors.\n\nAccording to \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\" by Alfred Kinsey and several other modern studies, the majority of humans have had both heterosexual and homosexual experiences or sensations and are bisexual. Kinsey himself, along with current sex therapists, focused on the historicity and fluidity of sexual orientation. Kinsey's studies consistently found sexual orientation to be something that evolves in many directions over a person's lifetime; rarely, but not necessarily, including forming attractions to a new sex. Rarely do individuals radically reorient their sexualities rapidly—and still less do they do so volitionally—but often sexualities expand, shift, and absorb new elements over decades. For example, socially normative \"age-appropriate\" sexuality requires a shifting object of attraction (especially in the passage through adolescence). Contemporary queer theory, incorporating many ideas from social constructionism, tends to look at sexuality as something that has meaning only within a given historical framework. Sexuality, then, is seen as a participation in a larger social discourse and, though in some sense fluid, not as something strictly determinable by the individual.\n\nOther studies have disputed Kinsey's methodology. \"His figures were undermined when it was revealed that he had disproportionately interviewed homosexuals and prisoners (many sex offenders).\"\n\nSexologists have attributed discrepancies in some findings to negative societal attitudes towards a particular sexual orientation. For example, people may state different sexual orientations depending on whether their immediate social environment is public or private. Reluctance to disclose one's actual sexual orientation is often referred to as \"being in the closet.\" Individuals capable of enjoyable sexual relations with both sexes or one sex may feel inclined to restrict themselves to heterosexual or homosexual relations in societies that stigmatize same-sex or opposite-sex relations.\n\nThe considerable \"nature and nurture\" debate exists over whether predominantly biological or psychological factors produce sexual orientation in humans, or whether both significantly factor into sexual orientation. Candidate factors include genes, the exposure of fetuses to certain hormones (or lack thereof) and environmental factors.\n\nThe studies performed in order to find the origin of sexual orientation have been criticized for being too limited in scope, mostly for focusing only on heterosexuality and homosexuality as two diametrically opposite poles with no orientation in between. It is also asserted that scientific studies focus too much on the search for a biological explanation for sexual orientation, and not enough on the combined effects of both biology and psychology.\n\nIn a brief by the Council for Responsible Genetics, it was stated that sexual orientation is not fixed either way, and on the discourse over sexual orientation: \"Noticeably missing from this debate is the notion, championed by Kinsey, that human sexual expression is as variable among people as many other complex traits. Yet just like intelligence, sexuality is a complex human feature that modern science is attempting to explain with genetics. Research on brain size, hormone levels, finger length, and other biological traits have yet to yield evidence for this, however. It is important to note that traits such as these result from a combination of gene expression and developmental and other environmental factors. Well-known biologist and social theorist, Anne Fausto-Sterling advocates in her book Sexing the Body, for what scientists term a “systems approach” to be applied to our understanding of sexual preference. Rather than determining that this results from purely biological processes, a trait evolves from developmental processes that include both biological and social elements.\" According to the American Psychological Association (APA), there are numerous theories about the origins of a person's sexual orientation, but some believe that \"sexual orientation is most likely the result of a complex interaction of environmental, cognitive and biological factors,\" and that genetic factors play a \"significant role\" in determining a person's sexuality.\n\nOften, sexual orientation and sexual orientation identity are not distinguished, which can impact accurately assessing sexual identity and whether or not sexual orientation is able to change; sexual orientation identity can change throughout an individual's life, and may or may not align with biological sex, sexual behavior or actual sexual orientation.<ref name=\"Concordance/discordance in SO\"></ref> While the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and American Psychiatric Association state that sexual orientation is innate, continuous or fixed throughout their lives for some people, but is fluid or changes over time for others, the American Psychological Association distinguishes between sexual orientation (an innate attraction) and sexual orientation identity (which may change at any point in a person's life).\n\nA 2012 study found that 2% of a sample of 2,560 adult participants reported a change of sexual orientation identity after a 10-year period. For men, a change occurred in 0.78% of those who had identified as heterosexual, 9.52% of homosexuals, and 47% of bisexuals. For women, a change occurred in 1.36% of heterosexuals, 63.6% of lesbians, and 64.7% of bisexuals. The researchers suggested that heterosexuality may be a more stable identity because of its normative status.\n\nA 2-year study by Lisa M. Diamond on a sample of 80 non-heterosexual female adolescents (age 16-23) reported that half of the participants had changed sexual-minority identities more than once, one third of them during the 2-year follow-up. Diamond concluded that \"although sexual attractions appear fairly stable, sexual identities and behaviors are more fluid.\"\n\nIn a 2004 study, the female subjects (both gay and straight women) became strongly sexually aroused when they viewed heterosexual as well as lesbian erotic films. Among the male subjects, however, the straight men were more turned on by erotic films with women, the gay ones more by those with men. The study's senior researcher said that women's sexual desire is less rigidly directed toward a particular sex, as compared with men's, and it is more changeable over time. However, the study did note that on average all men, regardless of sexual orientation, showed significantly more genital arousal to their non-preferred sex compared to neutral stimuli. Gay men showed some level of genital arousal to female stimuli and straight men showed some level of genital arousal to male stimuli.\n\nHeteroflexibility is a form of a sexual orientation or situational sexual behavior characterized by minimal homosexual activity in an otherwise primarily heterosexual orientation that is considered to distinguish it from bisexuality. It has been characterized as \"mostly straight\".\n\nSexual orientation change efforts are methods that aim to change sexual orientation, used to try to convert homosexual and bisexual people to heterosexuality. Scientists and mental health professionals generally do not believe that sexual orientation is a choice. There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor that conclude that sexual orientation change efforts work to change a person's sexual orientation. Those efforts have been controversial due to tensions between the values held by some faith-based organizations, on the one hand, and those held by LGBT rights organizations and professional and scientific organizations and other faith-based organizations, on the other. The longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the health and mental health professions is that homosexuality \"per se\" is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation, and therefore not a mental disorder.\n\nNo major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation. These include the American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, American Counseling Association, National Association of Social Workers in the US, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and the Australian Psychological Society. The American Psychological Association states that \"sexual orientation is not a choice that can be changed at will\", and \"sexual orientation identity—not sexual orientation—appears to change via psychotherapy, support groups, and life events.\" The American Psychiatric Association says \"individuals maybe become aware at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual\". While opposing conversion therapy, they encourage gay affirmative psychotherapy and \"encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others' sexual orientation and concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation\". The American Psychological Association and the Royal College of Psychiatrists expressed concerns that the positions espoused by NARTH are not supported by the science and create an environment in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish.\n\nSince the 1960s and 1970s, a large body of research has provided evidence and analysis of the extent to which heterosexuality and homosexuality are socially organized and historically changing. This work challenges the assumption that heterosexuality, homosexuality, and sexualities of all varieties, can be understood as primarily biological and psychological phenomena.\n\nA heterosexual couple, a man and woman in an intimate relationship, form the core of a nuclear family.\nMany societies throughout history have insisted that a marriage take place before the couple settle down, but enforcement of this rule or compliance with it has varied considerably. In some jurisdictions, when an unmarried man and woman live together long enough, they are deemed to have established a common-law marriage.\n\nThere was no real need to coin a term such as \"heterosexual\" until there was something else to contrast and compare it with. In “The Invention of Heterosexuality,” Jonathon Ned Katz dates the definition of heterosexuality, as it is used today, to the late 19th century. In the Victorian era, sex was seen as a means to achieve reproduction, relations between the sexes were not believed to be overtly sexual. The body was thought of as a tool for procreation, “human energy, though of as a closed and severely limited system, was to be used in producing children and in work, not wasted in libidinous pleasures.” Modern ideas of sexuality and eroticism began to develop in America and Germany in the later 19th century. The changing economy and the “transformation of the family from producer to consumer” resulted in shifting values. The Victorian work ethic had changed, pleasure became more highly valued and this allowed ideas of human sexuality to change. Consumer culture had created a market for the erotic, pleasure became commoditized. At the same time medical doctors began to acquire more power and influence. They developed the medical model of Normal Love in which healthy men and women enjoyed sex as part of a “new ideal of male-female relationships that included.. an essential, necessary, normal eroticism.” This ‘Normal Sexual’ ideal also had a counterpart, the Victorian Sex Pervert, anyone who failed to meet the norm. The basic oppositeness of the sexes was the basis for normal, healthy sexual attraction. “The attention paid the sexual abnormal created a need to name the sexual normal, the better to distinguish the average him and her from the deviant it.” The creation term ‘heterosexual’ consolidated the social existence of the pre-existing heterosexual experience and created a sense of ensured and validated normalcy within it.\n\nHeteronormativity denotes or relates to a world view that promotes heterosexuality as the normal or preferred sexual orientation for people to have. It can assign strict gender roles to males and females. The term was popularized by Michael Warner in 1991. Many gender and sexuality scholars argue that compulsory heterosexuality, a continual and repeating reassertion of heterosexual norms, is facet of heterosexism. Compulsory heterosexuality is the idea that female heterosexuality is both assumed and enforced by a patriarchal society. Heterosexuality is then viewed as the natural inclination or obligation by both sexes. Consequently, anyone who differs from the normalcy of heterosexuality is deemed deviant or abhorrent.\n\nHeterosexism is a form of bias or discrimination in favor of opposite-sex sexuality and relationships. It may include an assumption that everyone is heterosexual and may involve a varied level of discrimination against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, heteroflexibles, or transgender individuals.\n\nStraight pride is a slogan that arose in the late 1980s and early 1990s and has been used primarily by social conservative groups as a political stance and strategy. The term is described as a response to gay pride adopted by various LGBT groups in the early 1970s or to the accommodations provided to gay pride initiatives.\n\n\n\n"}

Addabbo\n\nJoseph Patrick Addabbo (March 17, 1925 – April 10, 1986) was a New York City politician who served as a Democrat in the United States House of Representatives from 1961 until his death from a seizure in Washington, D.C. in 1986. As the chairman of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense in the 1980s, he was a noted critic of President Ronald Reagan's massive defense spending increases.\n\nAddabbo was born in Queens, New York and lived in the borough his entire life. He was a 1946 graduate of St. John's Law School and practiced law in Ozone Park, New York before his election to Congress in 1960. Addabbo was the Democratic nominee to replace Queens Rep. Albert H. Bosch, a Republican who left Congress to begin a judicial career.\n\nAddabbo became chairman of the defense spending subcommittee in 1979. In the post, he frequently sparred with President Reagan and was a favorite media source for accounts of the epic military spending battles in the early 1980s. Addabbo created a yearly routine of calling for deep cuts to the administration's budget. In 1983, he proposed slashing Reagan's defense spending plan by $30 billion. Though Addabbo's efforts were usually unsuccessful, he managed to eliminate funding for MX and Pershing II missiles in 1982.\n\nAlthough he usually sailed to reelection in his overwhelmingly Democratic and Italian-American Southwestern Queens district, a reapportionment following the 1980 census spelled trouble for Addabbo in his final two campaigns. His district absorbed a considerably larger number of African Americans in Jamaica, Queens than had previously been in the district. His old district was 35 percent black, while his new district was 65 percent black. Some of his Italian-American base were moved into the district of fellow Democrat Charles Schumer while others were moved into the district of fellow Italian-American Democrat Geraldine Ferraro, who had won a closer-than-expected election two years earlier. This left him open to a surprisingly strong primary challenge from black real estate developer Simeon Golar in 1982. Two years later, Golar ran again with the active backing of then-presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, but Addabbo won again.\n\nAddabbo's health started to fail shortly after his 1984 re-election. In 1985, he spent four months in the Walter Reed Army Medical Center with a cancer-related kidney ailment. After returning to work for two months in early 1986, he fell ill at a luncheon in March and lapsed into a coma on March 12. He died a month later, aged 61, and was buried in Saint John's Cemetery, Queens.\n\nAfter Addabbo's death, Queens elected its first African-American congressman after a disputed special election between two black candidates. In 2001, Addabbo's son, Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., was elected as the New York City Council representative for District 32 in Queens. He was elected to the New York State Senate in 2008.\n\n\n"}

Thirteen-year-old Amar Kishen, aka Butterfingers, now features in the eponymous Butterfingers series of novels and short story collections published by Puffin, the children’s imprint of Penguin Books India, currently Penguin Random House India.\n\nKhyrunnisa’s first three children’s novels \"Howzzat Butterfingers!\" (2010), \"Goal, Butterfingers! (2012)\" and \"Clean Bowled, Butterfingers!\" \"(2015)\", were followed by two collections of short stories, \"The Misadventures of Butterfingers (2016\") and \"Run, It's Butterfingers Again!\" (2017). All the Butterfingers books were launched by Shashi Tharoor, Member of Parliament.\n\nA book of her prize-winning stories, \"Lost in Ooty and Other Adventure Stories\", was brought out by Unisun Publications in 2010. Some of her stories for children and for adults have appeared in anthologies published by Puffin, Children’s Book Trust, Talking Cub and Unisun Publications. She writes stories regularly for the children’s magazine, \"Dimdima\", a Bhavan’s publication.\n\n‘Butterfingers,’ Khyrunnisa’s entry for the Annual All India Tinkle Short story competition for adult writers of children’s fiction in 1996, won her the second prize. She went on to win the first prize at the competition for the next seven consecutive years – from 1997-2003. In 2007, she won the prestigious Unisun Children’s Fiction Award. She also has five Children’s Book Trust prizes to her credit.\n\nKhyrunnisa’s parents, A.R. Bijli and Ayesha Bijli, settled down in Trivandrum as her father, a post master, believed that Trivandrum was the best place to provide his eight children, seven of whom were girls, with good education.\n\nShe continues to reside in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, with her husband P.

She was appointed Management Trainee in Punjab National Bank and worked there for two years before resigning to take up a teaching job at All Saints’ College.\n\nShe was a columnist for \"The New Indian Express\", writing on classics and well known works of fiction. She has freelanced for publications like \"Outlook Traveller, Manorama Year Book\" and \"Kerala Calling\", among others. She has an ongoing fortnightly column, \"Inside View,\" in \"The Hindu MetroPlus\".\n\nThe Butterfinger series revolves around the hilarious escapades of thirteen-year-old Amar Kishen, a class VIII student of the fictitious Green Park Higher Secondary School. Amar’s slip-grip methods and his clumsy antics earned him the nickname Butterfingers.\n\nButterfingers, named after Khyrunnisa’s son, Amar, first appeared in 2006 in Tinkle, a popular fortnightly Indian children's magazine, as a regular comic-strip character. The illustrations were by Abhijeet Kini, the Mumbai based illustrator and graphic artist.\n\nThe popular Butterfingers series, published by Puffin, began with the novel, \"Howzzat Butterfingers!\" , In 2010. This humorous cricket-based book was followed in 2012 by \"Goal, Butterfingers!\"\",\" a rollicking football-based adventure novel which also includes a socially relevant environmental theme. The third in the series, \"‘Clean Bowled, Butterfingers!\" was published in 2015 and is another cricket-based novel with a hilariously farcical plot in which Amar and his friends invent a variation of cricket called ‘Crack It’ when the school’s cricket gear gets stolen. This game, played without cricket bats and balls, has its own absurd rules and generates immense fun.\n\n\"The Misadventures of Butterfingers\", the fourth book in the series, came out in 2016 and is a collection of short stories.

{"id": "2064083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064083", "title": "Layering", "text": "Layering\n\nLayering has evolved as a common means of vegetative propagation of numerous species in natural environments. Layering is also utilized by horticulturists to propagate desirable plants.\n\nNatural layering typically occurs when a branch touches the ground, whereupon it produces adventitious roots. At a later stage the connection with the parent plant is severed and a new plant is produced as a result.\n\nThe horticultural layering process typically involves wounding the target region to expose the inner stem and optionally applying rooting compounds. In ground layering or simple layering, the stem is bent down and the target region buried in the soil. This is done in plant nurseries in imitation of natural layering by many plants such as brambles which bow over and touch the tip on the ground, at which point it grows roots and, when separated, can continue as a separate plant. In either case, the rooting process may take from several weeks to a year.\n\nLayering is more complicated than taking cuttings, but has the advantage that the propagated portion continues to receive water and nutrients from the parent plant while it is forming roots. This is important for plants that form roots slowly, or for propagating large pieces. Layering is used quite frequently in the propagation of bonsai; it is also used as a technique for both creating new roots and improving existing roots.\n\nA low-growing stem is bent down to touch a hole dug in the ground, then pinned in place using something shaped like a clothes hanger hook and covered over with soil. However, a few inches of leafy growth must remain above the ground for the bent stem to grow into a new plant. Removing a section of skin from the lower-facing stem part before burying may help the rooting process. If using rooting hormone, the stem should be cut just beneath a node. The resultant notch should be wedged open with a toothpick or similar piece of wood and the hormone applied before burying.\n\nThe buried stem part then grows new roots which take hold in the soil while the above parts grow as individual new plants. Once the end of the stem has grown long enough the process can be repeated, creating the appearance of a row of plants linked by humped, intermittently buried stems. Better results can be achieved when the top of the plant is closer to the vertical.\n\nOnce the process is completed, the buried section should be kept well-watered until roots begin to form. The new individual plant may require one to two years before it is strong enough to survive on its own. When it is, the original stem should be cut where it enters the ground, thereby separating the two plants.\n\nAs layering does not involve sexual reproduction, new plants are effectively clones of the original plant and will exhibit the same characteristics. This includes flower, fruit and foliage. Plant selection usually involves plants with a flexible stem.\n\nSimple layering can be more attractive when managing a cascading or spreading plant. These plants tend to propagate in this manner anyway, and potting a new limb will give extra plants without having to sow new seed.\n\nSimple layering can also help when a plant has overgrown its pot and is drooping over the side. The long stem is layered into another pot until it roots, thus bringing it back to soil level.\n\nGround layering or mound layering is the typical propagation technique for the popular Malling-Merton series of clonal apple rootstocks, in which the original plants are set in the ground with the stem nearly horizontal, which forces side buds to grow upward. After these are started, the original stem is buried up to some distance from the tip. At the end of the growing season, the side branches will have rooted, and can be separated while the plant is dormant. Some of these will be used for grafting rootstocks, and some can be reused in the nursery for the next growing season's crop.\n\nGround layering is used in the formation of visible surface roots, known as \"nebari\", on bonsai trees. \n\nIn air layering (or marcotting), the target region is wounded by an upward 4 cm long cut and held open with a toothpick or similar, or a strip of bark is removed. The wound is then surrounded with a lump of moisture-retaining medium such as sphagnum moss or cloth, and then further surrounded by a moisture barrier such as plastic film tied or taped to the branch to prevent moisture loss or ingress of too much water as from rain. Rooting hormone is often applied to the wound to encourage root growth. When sufficient roots have grown from the wound, the stem is removed from the parent plant and planted, taking care to shield it from too much sun and to protect it from drying out until the new roots take hold. It can take the layer from a few weeks to one or more growing seasons to produce sufficient roots; this is largely dependent on the plant species and the vigor of the parent plant.\n\n\n"}

In 2015, investigators had the body exhumed and sent samples for a DNA profile; so far there have been no matches to those in any database.\n\nOn the morning of December 6, 1983, a woman's body was found by utility workers in a roadside ditch alongside eastbound NY 17 (now Interstate 86) in the Chautauqua County town of Ellery. She had been shot four times: twice in the chest, once in the mouth and once in the back. The woman carried documents available in European countries and in Canada and had dental work appearing to use European techniques. The victim had brown eyes and graying brown hair, and was also estimated to have given birth to a child within the last 15 years. She was between 33 and 37 years of age when she had died, hours before being found. She was around tall and weighed around . It is suspected that she may have been Canadian, as she carried a handwritten note with indecipherable abbreviations that originated from an establishment in British Columbia. She had some distinct characteristics: a wart was visible above her left eye, a mole was found behind the left ear and a scar was visible on her neck. The victim's clothing has caused some issues with determining her social class, as she wore both expensive and inexpensive clothing. The undershirt she wore originated from Italy and was not worth a lot of money. This product had also not been circulated globally. She also wore a multicolored trench coat that was fairly expensive, along with a pullover and a \"handmade\" skirt.\n\nOn April 2, 1985, a man's remains were found nearly two years after his death, in Philipstown, Putnam County, New York. He was found with a dress shirt along with shorts, two pairs of pants with army coloring and corduroy material and work boots. Several pairs of underwear and socks were also found at the scene. A map of New York and New Jersey, a comb, dental floss and playing cards were among his possessions. At one time in his life, he received orthodontic care.\n\nOn February 14, 1988, the \"posed\" nude body of a woman was found on a street in Mount Vernon, Westchester County, New York. The victim had been dead for approximately six to twelve hours, and was bound at the wrists and ankles and had died from ligature strangulation as well as suffering a beating. She was aged 18 to 30, with hazel eyes and with bleached, light brown or blonde hair. She was 5 feet 3 inches tall, weighed 105 pounds, and had pierced ears without earrings. She had numerous freckles and moles (including a large and prominent mole on her neck). Her underarms had not been shaved for approximately two weeks, but her pubic area was recently shaved. This detail has led some investigators to presume she could have been a prostitute. The fact that the rest of the body showed an absence of shaving, it has also been suggested she was foreign to the United States, and could be of South American descent. Her nails were painted pink prior to her death. No clothing was found at or near the scene. An autopsy found that she had ingested cocaine and broccoli before her murder, which may have been the work of a serial offender.\n\nOn July 31, 1988, a skeleton was found in a shallow grave by a boy who was digging at the edge of his family's property in Irondequoit, Monroe County, New York. No signs of trauma were found, but the cause of death was ruled as a homicide.\n\nThe remains were those of a white female between 4 feet 10 inches and 5 feet 5 inches tall. Her weight, hair color, and eye color could not be determined. She had significant dental restoration, which included gold foil fillings.\n\nThe victim, who was between 15 and 19 years of age, may have been deceased for as long as 10 to 30 years before being found . No clothing was found at the scene. A single white button, which may have belonged to the victim, was found near the remains.\n\nThe dismembered corpses of several females discovered between 1996 and present day.\n\nThe torso of a woman found in 1997. She is known for her unique peach tattoo.\n\nOn May 3, 1998, the skeleton of a black male was found in the Orange County town of Woodbury. He had been shot twice in the head by two guns of different calibers and left near a rest area for hikers. His body had been wrapped in plastic and he was fully clothed. He carried a hair pick, a lighter and a French to English dictionary, indicating that he may have been from a Francophone country. Although the body was found in 1998, he was believed to have died as early as 1985. He was knock-kneed and between 5 feet 6 inches and 5 feet 11 inches in height, although he was more likely around five feet nine inches. He had been between seventeen and twenty-five years of age, but could have been as old as thirty-five. He wore a blue jacket, a black shirt containing a pot of gold design with the words \"follow your dreams,\" jeans and sneakers from the Pony company. He had had dental work, including fillings, crowns and a possible root canal. He had suffered a fracture of his right hand some weeks prior to death.\n\nA torso and pair of legs discovered in 2007. Like the torso found in 1997, dubbed \"Peaches\", she may have been a victim of the Long Island serial killer.\n\n"}

{"id": "39044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39044", "title": "Mesoderm", "text": "Mesoderm\n\nIn all bilaterian animals, the mesoderm is one of the three primary germ layers in the very early embryo. The other two layers are the ectoderm (outside layer) and endoderm (inside layer), with the mesoderm as the middle layer between them.\n\nThe mesoderm forms mesenchyme, mesothelium, non-epithelial blood cells and coelomocytes. Mesothelium lines coeloms. Mesoderm forms the muscles in a process known as myogenesis, septa (cross-wise partitions) and mesenteries (length-wise partitions); and forms part of the gonads (the rest being the gametes). Myogenesis is specifically a function of mesenchyme.\n\nThe mesoderm differentiates from the rest of the embryo through intercellular signaling, after which the mesoderm is polarized by an organizing center. The position of the organizing center is in turn determined by the regions in which beta-catenin is protected from degradation by GSK-3. Beta-catenin acts as a co-factor that alters the activity of the transcription factor tcf-3 from repressing to activating, which initiates the synthesis of gene products critical for mesoderm differentiation and gastrulation. Furthermore, mesoderm has the capability to induce the growth of other structures, such as the neural plate, the precursor to the nervous system.\n\nThe mesoderm is one of the three germinal layers that appears in the third week of embryonic development. It is formed through a process called gastrulation. There are three important components, the paraxial mesoderm, the intermediate mesoderm and the lateral plate mesoderm. The paraxial mesoderm forms the somitomeres, which give rise to mesenchyme of the head and organize into somites in occipital and caudal segments. give, sclerotome (cartilage and bone), and dermatome (subcutaneous tissue of the skin). Signals for somite differentiation are derived from surroundings structures, including the notochord, neural tube and epidermis. The intermediate mesoderm connects the paraxial mesoderm with the lateral plate, eventually it differentiates into urogenital structures consisting of the kidneys, gonads, their associated ducts, and the adrenal glands. The lateral plate mesoderm give rise to the heart, blood vessels and blood cells of the circulatory system as well as to the mesodermal components of the limbs.\n\nSome of the mesoderm derivatives include the muscle (smooth, cardiac and skeletal), the muscles of the tongue (occipital somites), the pharyngeal arches muscle (muscles of mastication, muscles of facial expressions), connective tissue, dermis and subcutaneous layer of the skin, bone and cartilage, dura mater, endothelium of blood vessels, red blood cells, white blood cells, and microglia, the kidneys and the adrenal cortex.\n\nDuring the third week a process called gastrulation creates a mesodermal layer between the endoderm and the ectoderm. This process begins with formation of a primitive streak on the surface of the epiblast. The cells of the layers move between the epiblast and hypoblast and begin to spread laterally and cranially. The cells of the epiblast move toward the primitive streak and slip beneath it in a process called invagination. Some of the migrating cells displace the hypoblast and create the endoderm, and others migrate between the endoderm and the epiblast to create the mesoderm. The remaining cells form the ectoderm. After that, the epiblast and the hypoblast establish contact with the extraembryonic mesoderm until they cover the yolk sac and amnion. They move onto either side of the prechordal plate. The prechordal cells migrate to the midline to form the notochordal plate. The chordamesoderm is the central region of trunk mesoderm. This forms the notochord which induces the formation of the neural tube and establishes the anterior-posterior body axis. The notochord extends beneath the neural tube from the head to the tail. The mesoderm moves to the midline until it covers the notochord, when the mesoderm cells proliferate they form the paraxial mesoderm. In each side, the mesoderm remains thin and is known as the lateral plate. The intermediate mesoderm lies between the paraxial mesoderm and the lateral plate.\nBetween days 13 and 15, the proliferation of extraembryonic mesoderm, primitive streak and embryonic mesoderm take place. The notochord process occurs between days 15 and 17. Eventually, the development of the notochord canal and the axial canal takes place between days 17 and 19 when the first three somites are formed.\n\nDuring the third week, the paraxial mesoderm is organized into segments. If they appear in the cephalic region and grow with cephalocaudal direction, they are called somitomeres. If they appear in the cephalic region but establish contact with the neural plate, they are known as neuromeres, which later will form the mesenchyme in the head. The somitomeres organize into somites which grow in pairs. In the fourth week the somites lose their organization and cover the notochord and spinal cord to form the backbone. In the fifth week, there are 4 occipital somites, 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 8 to 10 coccygeal that will form the axial skeleton. Somitic derivatives are determined by local signaling between adjacent embryonic tissues, in particular the neural tube, notochord, surface ectoderm and the somitic compartments themselves. The correct specification of the deriving tissues, skeletal, cartilage, endothelia and connective tissue is achieved by a sequence of morphogenic changes of the paraxial mesoderm, leading to the three transitory somitic compartments: dermomyotome, myotome and sclerotome. These structures are specified from dorsal to ventral and from medial to lateral. each somite will form its own sclerotome that will differentiate into the tendon cartilage and bone component. Its myotome will form the muscle component and the dermatome that will form the dermis of the back. The myotome and dermatome have a nerve component.\n\nSurrounding structures such as the notochord, neural tube, epidermis and lateral plate mesoderm send signals for somite differentiation Notochord protein accumulates in presomitic mesoderm destined to form the next somite and then decreases as that somite is established. The notochord and the neural tube activate the protein SHH which helps the somite to form its sclerotome. The cells of the sclerotome express the protein PAX1 that induces the cartilage and bone formation. The neural tube activates the protein WNT1 that expresses PAX 2 so the somite creates the myotome and dermatome. Finally, the neural tube also secretes neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), so that the somite creates the dermis. Boundaries for each somite are regulated by retinoic acid (RA) and a combination of FGF8 and WNT3a. So the retinoic acid is an endogenous signal that maintains the bilateral synchrony of mesoderm segmentation and controls bilateral symmetry in vertebrates. The bilaterally symmetric body plan of vertebrate embryos is obvious in somites and their derivates such as the vertebral column. Therefore, asymmetric somite formation correlates with a left-right desynchronization of the segmentation oscillations.\n\nMany studies with Xenopus and zebrafish have analyzed the factors of this development and how they interact in signaling and transcription. However, there are still some doubts in how the prospective mesodermal cells integrate the various signals they receive and how they regulate their morphogenic behaviours and cell-fate decisions. Human embryonic stem cells for example have the potential to produce all of the cells in the body and they are able to self-renew indefinitely so they can be used for a large-scale production of therapeutic cell lines. They are also able to remodel and contract collagen and were induced to express muscle actin. This shows that these cells are multipotent cells.\n\nThe intermediate mesoderm connects the paraxial mesoderm with the lateral plate and differentiates into urogenital structures. In upper thoracic and cervical regions this forms the nephrotomes, and in caudally regions this forms the nephrogenic cord. It also helps to develop the excretory units of the urinary system and the gonads.\n\nThe lateral plate mesoderm splits into parietal (somatic) and visceral (splanchnic) layers. The formation of these layers starts with the appearance of intercellular cavities. The somatic layer depends on a continuous layer with mesoderm that covers the amnion. The splanchnic depends on a continuous layer that covers the yolk sac. The two layers cover the intraembryonic cavity. The parietal layer together with overlying ectoderm forms the lateral body wall folds. The visceral layer forms the walls of the gut tube. Mesoderm cells of the parietal layer form the mesothelial membranes or serous membranes which line the peritoneal, pleural and pericardial cavities.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "66492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66492", "title": "Mi-Go", "text": "Mi-Go\n\nMi-Go are a fictional race of extraterrestrials created by H. P. Lovecraft and used by others in the Cthulhu Mythos setting. The word Mi-Go comes from \"Migou\", a Tibetan word for yeti. The aliens are fungus-based lifeforms which are extremely varied due to their prodigious surgical, biological, chemical, and mechanical skill. The variants witnessed by Akeley in \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" look like winged humanoid crabs, and do not resemble yeti.\n\nMi-Go are first named as such in Lovecraft's short story \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" (1931). However this is considered an elaboration on earlier references in his sonnet cycle \"Fungi from Yuggoth\" (1929–30) to descriptions of alien vegetation on dream-worlds.\n\nThe Mi-Go have appeared across a range of media set in the Cthulhu Mythos.\n\nThe \"Mi-Go\" are large, pinkish, fungoid, crustacean-like entities the size of a man; where a head would be, they have a \"convoluted ellipsoid\" composed of pyramided, fleshy rings and covered in antennae. They are about long, and their crustacean-like bodies bear numerous sets of paired appendages. They possess a pair of membranous bat-like wings which are used to fly through the \"aether\" of outer space. The wings do not function well on Earth. Several other races in Lovecraft's Mythos also have wings like these.\n\nIn the original short story, the creatures cannot be recorded using ordinary photographic film, due to their bodies being formed from otherworldly matter.\nThey are capable of going into suspended animation until softened and reheated by the sun or some other source of heat.\n\nThe Mi-Go can transport humans from Earth to Pluto (and beyond) and back again by removing the subject's brain and placing it into a \"brain cylinder\" as an isolated brain, which can be attached to external devices to allow it to see, hear, and speak.\n\nIn \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" the Mi-Go are heard to give praise to Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath, suggesting some form of worship. Their moral system is completely alien, making them seem highly malicious from a human perspective.\n\nOne of the moons of Yuggoth holds designs that are sacred to the Mi-Go; these are useful in various processes mentioned in the \"Necronomicon\". It is said that transcriptions of these designs can be sensed by the Mi-Go, and those possessing them shall be hunted down by the few remaining on earth.\n\nSupposedly, a group known as the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign are dedicated to hunting them down and exterminating the fungoid threat, though it is unknown if this is actually true since it was given as a reason for their remaining hidden. Hastur, which is mentioned in passing among several other places and things, was eventually converted into a God-Like alien being by August Derleth who gave it the title \"Him Who is Not to be Named\". However, in \"The Whisperer in Darkness\", a human ally of the Mi-Go mentions \"Him Who Is Not to Be Named\" in the list of honored entities along with Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath. Lovecraft never made a connection between Hastur and \"Him Who Is Not to Be Named\", and indeed didn't even imply Hastur was a being; Derleth was the one to do so.\n\nThe Mi-Go appear in the Lovecraft novella \"At the Mountains of Madness\" (1931), in which they are described as having made war with the Elder Things long before the existence of humans.\n\nThe Mi-Go appeared in comic books in the first three issues of \"\" that featured the Miskatonic Project, created by Mark Ellis.\n\nThe Mi-Go are prominent antagonists in Pagan Publishing's \"Delta Green\" sourcebook for the \"Call of Cthulhu\" role-playing game. It mentions three castes: scientist, soldier, and worker. The book states that the Mi-Go usually have five pairs of appendages, though the number can vary. Normally, the first pair is designed for grasping and manipulating, but in the scientist caste it is usually the first two pairs. The remaining appendages are used for locomotion. The soldiers may have two or more pairs of wings. Some individuals do not have wings at all if they are deemed unnecessary to their task. The Mi-Go apparently can modify their own bodies. This source suggests that all their external accoutrements are actually extruded at will from the central gelatinous mass similar to the way the Shoggoth extrude body parts. In the \"Delta Green\" setting, the \"Greys\" are puppets remotely controlled by the Mi-Go.\n\nThey are distinguished by their mastery in various fields of science, especially surgery. Although they originate from beyond our solar system, they have set up an outpost on Pluto (known as Yuggoth in the mythos) and sometimes visit Earth to mine for minerals and other natural resources. The Mi-Go normally communicate by changing the colors of their orb-like heads or by emitting odd buzzing noises. They can also speak any human language upon receiving the appropriate surgical modification.\n\nThe Mi-Go are one of the main enemies of humanity in the role-playing game CthulhuTech, which combines Lovecraft's fiction with tropes and themes from mecha anime. In the game, their name is spelled “Migou” (see below), but they are commonly referred to as \"bugs\" by humans.\n\nThey are presented in CthulhuTech much as they are in the original Lovecraft stories, and somewhat similar to that in Delta Green: they are masters of science and genetics, and in particular human genetics. Their hostility to humanity could be seen as jealousy that humans had created a technology which they had never thought of, combined with a fear of humanity's growing power. Although it is stated that they have emotions vastly different from our own, their campaign on Earth developed into genocidal hatred of humans.\n\nIn \"Allan and the Sundered Veil\", Allan Quatermain, Randolph Carter, John Carter of Mars, and the Time Traveller encounter the Mi-Go, which are stated to be the same as Morlocks and the Yetis.\n\nIn \"To Mars and Providence\", the Mi-Go engage in trade with the Martians from \"The War of the Worlds\".\n\nThe Mi-Go appear in the final segment of the movie \"Necronomicon\", directed by Brian Yuzna.\n\nA Mi-Go is scripted to walk across the stage during the \"Tentacles\" number of \"A Shoggoth on the Roof\", prompting Armitage to say \"some horrible creature... I do not even want to know what \"that\" is\".\n\nThe horror-themed miniatures game HorrorClix, which features Cthulhu as a colossal figure, includes a Mi-Go as a unique figure in its \"The Lab\" expansion.\n\nThe Mi-Go also appear as sinister brain collectors in the short story \"Boojum\", written by Sarah Monette and Elizabeth Bear.\n\nThe computer game \"\" features the Mi-Go among the numerous different types of monster that assault the earth. This Mi-Go appears to be inspired by, rather than lifted from, the original Lovecraftian creature, since their unique feature in the game is to mimic human speech and other sounds in an attempt to lure people towards them.\n\nIt is possible that Lovecraft encountered the word \"migou\" in his readings. \"Migou\" is the Tibetan equivalent of the yeti, an ape-like cryptid said to inhabit the high mountain ranges of that region. While the Mi-Go of Lovecraft's mythos is completely unlike the migou of Tibetan stories, Lovecraft seems to equate the two, as can be seen in the following excerpt from \"The Whisperer in Darkness\":\n\n"}

The case was widely reported at the time and resulted in a public enquiry: \"Committee of Inquiry into the Care and Supervision Provided in Relation to Maria Colwell (1974). Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Care and Supervision provided by local authorities and other agencies in Relation to Maria Colwell and the co-ordination between them.\" (Chairman: T.G. Field-Fisher)\n\n40 years after her death the case of Maria Colwell has remained in collective memory and has often been referred to when similar cases have come to light, such as the death of Victoria Climbié in 2000, Peter Connelly in 2007 and Daniel Pelka in 2012.\n\nMaria was one of six siblings and is survived by her three half-brothers and two half-sisters, as well as her foster parents Bob and Doris Cooper, with whom she spent six years of her life.\n\nMaria was born on 26 March 1965. When she was a few months old her father Raymond Colwell died and as a result Maria and her siblings were all placed in foster care. At three months old she was placed with her aunt and uncle, Doris and Bob Cooper. There she was said to be very happy and well looked after.\nHer situation changed drastically when on 22 October 1971 she returned to live with her biological mother Pauline Kepple and her partner William Kepple on the Whitehawk council estate in Brighton, England.\n\nWilliam Kepple had children of his own with Pauline, and the couple favoured those children over Maria without compunction; for example, Kepple bought his biological children ice cream and required Maria to watch as they ate it, having refused to buy any for her. Many neighbours and teachers communicated concerns to various agencies. Nevertheless, even though she appeared \"almost a walking skeleton\", Maria was allowed to remain with the Kepples and her half-siblings.\n\nOn the night of 6 January 1973, Kepple arrived home at 11:30pm to find Maria still awake and watching television. Her mother, fearing her drunk and violent husband, had kept Maria up. Maria refused to acknowledge him upon his return home and he responded violently. He physically assaulted her, leaving her with severe injuries both internal and external; then he went to bed. The following morning he wheeled Maria in a pram to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton with severe internal injuries including brain damage; she died shortly after arrival. Maria had an empty stomach when she died. Both her eyes were blackened and she had a fractured rib.\n\nThe case captured the public’s attention and the press called for action. Despite the publication of a book urging the tragedy not to be forgotten it took over thirty years before agencies were required by law to guarantee the free-flow of information.\n\nAn inquiry was set up and was chaired by Thomas Gilbert Field Fisher, a Recorder of the Crown Court. Other members included Olive Stevenson, a social work academic. The \"Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Care and Supervision Provided in Relation to Maria Colwell\" identified three main contributory factors: the lack of communication between the agencies who were aware of her vulnerable situation; inadequate training for social workers assigned to at-risk children; and changes in the make-up of society.\"It is not enough for the State as representing society to assume responsibility for those such as Maria\" \"Fisher\"\n\nKepple was later found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to eight years in prison; his sentence was halved on appeal.\n\nDespite the local council commissioning its own response to Fisher’s findings, \"Children at risk : a study by the East Sussex County Council into the problems revealed by the Report of the Inquiry into the case of Maria Colwell\" and repeated \"it must never happen again\" press articles, there were several high profile cases after the Colwell case, such as the cases of Heidi Koseda, Jasmine Beckford, and Toni-Ann Byfield before the case of Victoria Climbié finally produced the government legislation known as Every Child Matters.\n"}

After his death the command of Ghent was taken up by Franz Ackerman.\n\nHis life was commemorated in a tragic play by Sir Henry Taylor in 1834.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13561452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13561452", "title": "Philosophy of desire", "text": "Philosophy of desire\n\nIn philosophy, desire has been identified as a philosophical problem since Antiquity. In Plato's \"The Republic\", Socrates argues that individual desires must be postponed in the name of the higher ideal.\n\nWithin the teachings of Buddhism, craving is thought to be the cause of all suffering. By eliminating craving, a person can attain ultimate happiness, or Nirvana. While on the path to liberation, a practitioner is advised to \"generate desire\" for skillful ends.\n\nIn Aristotle's \"De Anima\" the soul is seen to be involved in motion, because animals desire things and in their desire, they acquire locomotion. Aristotle argued that desire is implicated in animal interactions and the propensity of animals to motion. But Aristotle acknowledges that desire cannot account for all purposive movement towards a goal. He brackets the problem by positing that perhaps reason, in conjunction with desire and by way of the imagination, makes it possible for one to apprehend an object of desire, to see it as desirable. In this way reason and desire work together to determine what is a good object of desire. This resonates with desire in the chariots of Plato's \"Phaedrus\", for in the \"Phaedrus\" the soul is guided by two horses, a dark horse of passion and a white horse of reason. Here passion and reason, as in Aristotle, are also together. Socrates does not suggest the dark horse be done away with, since its passions make possible a movement towards the objects of desire, but he qualifies desire and places it in a relation to reason so that the object of desire can be discerned correctly, so that we may have the right desire. Aristotle distinguishes desire into two aspects of appetition, and volition. Appetition, or appetite, is a longing for or seeking after something.\n\nAristotle makes the distinction as follows:\n\nIn \"Passions of the Soul\", René Descartes writes of the passion of desire as an agitation of the soul that projects desire, for what it represents as agreeable, into the future. Desire in Immanuel Kant can represent things that are absent and not only objects at hand. Desire is also the preservation of objects already present, as well as the desire that certain effects not appear, that what affects one adversely be curtailed and prevented in the future. Moral and temporal values attach to desire in that objects which enhance one's future are considered more desirable than those that do not, and it introduces the possibility, or even necessity, of postponing desire in anticipation of some future event, anticipating Sigmund Freud's text \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\". See also, the pleasure principle in psychology.\n\nIn his \"Ethics\", Baruch Spinoza declares desire to be \"the very essence of man,\" in the \"Definitions of the Affects\" at the end of Part III. An early example of desire as an ontological principle, it applies to all things or \"modes\" in the world, each of which has a particular vital \"striving\" (sometimes expressed with the Latin \"conatus\") \"to persist in existence\" (Part III, Proposition 7). Different striving beings have different levels of power, depending on their capacity to persevere in being. Affects, or emotions which are divided into the \"joyful\" and the \"sad\", alter our level of power or striving: joy is a passage \"from a lesser to a greater perfection\" or degree of power (III Prop. 11 Schol.), just as sadness is the opposite. Desire, qualified by the imagination and the intellect, is an attempt to maximize power, to \"strive to imagine those things that increase or aid the body's power of acting.\" (III Prop. 12). Spinoza ends the \"Ethics\" by a proposition that both moral virtue and spiritual blessedness are a direct result of essential power to exist, i.e. desire (Part V Prop. 42).\n\nIn \"A Treatise on Human Nature\", David Hume suggests that reason is subject to passion. Motion is put into effect by desire, passions, and inclinations. It is desire, along with belief, that motivates action. Immanuel Kant establishes a relation between the beautiful and pleasure in \"Critique of Judgment\". He says \"I can say of every representation that it is at least possible (as a cognition) it should be bound up with a pleasure. Of representation that I call pleasant I say that it actually excites pleasure in me. But the beautiful we think as having a necessary reference to satisfaction.\" Desire is found in the representation of the object.\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel begins his exposition of desire in \"Phenomenology of Spirit\" with the assertion that \"self-consciousness is the state of desire () in general.\" It is in the restless movement of the negative that desire removes the antithesis between itself and its object, \"...and the object of immediate desire is a living thing...\", and object that forever remains an independent existence, something other. Hegel's inflection of desire via stoicism becomes important in understanding desire as it appears in Marquis de Sade. Stoicism in this view has a negative attitude towards \"...otherness, to desire, and work.\"\n\nReading Maurice Blanchot in this regard, in his essay \"Sade's Reason\", the libertine is one, of a type that sometimes intersects with a Sadean man, who finds in stoicism, solitude, and apathy the proper conditions. Blanchot writes, \"...the libertine is thoughtful, self-contained, incapable of being moved by just anything.\" Apathy in de Sade is opposition not to desire but to its spontaneity. Blanchot writes that in Sade, \"for passion to become energy, it is necessary that it be constricted, that it be mediated by passing through a necessary moment of insensibility, then it will be the greatest passion possible.\" Here is stoicism, as a form of discipline, through which the passions pass. Blanchot says, \"Apathy is the spirit of negation, applied to the man who has chosen to be sovereign.\" Dispersed, uncontrolled passion does not augment one's creative force but diminishes it.\n\nIn his \"Principia Ethica\", British philosopher G. E. Moore argued that two theories of desire should be clearly distinguished. The hedonistic theory of John Stuart Mill states that pleasure is the sole object of all desire. Mill suggests that a desire for an object is caused by an idea of the possible pleasure that would result from the attainment of the object. The desire is fulfilled when this pleasure is achieved. On this view, the pleasure is the sole motivating factor of the desire. Moore proposes an alternative theory in which an actual pleasure is already present in the desire for the object and that the desire is then for that object and only indirectly for any pleasure that results from attaining it. \n\"In the first place, plainly, we are not always conscious of expecting pleasure, when we desire a thing. We may only be conscious of the thing which we desire, and may be impelled to make for it at once, without any calculation as to whether it will bring us pleasure or pain. In the second place, even when we do expect pleasure, it can certainly be very rarely pleasure only which we desire. On Moore's view, Mill's theory is too non-specific as to the objects of desire. Moore provides the following example: \n\"For instance, granted that, when I desire my glass of port wine, I have also an idea of the pleasure I expect from it, plainly that pleasure cannot be the only object of my desire; the port wine must be included in my object, else I might be led by my desire to take wormwood instead of wine . . . If the desire is to take a definite direction, it is absolutely necessary that the idea of the object, from which the pleasure is expected, should also be present and should control my activity.\"\n\nFor Charles Fourier, following desires (like passions or in Fourier's own words 'attractions') is a means to attain harmony.\n\nWithin the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (Buddhism), craving is thought to be the cause of all suffering that one experiences in human existence. The extinction of this craving leads one to ultimate happiness, or Nirvana. Nirvana means \"cessation\", \"extinction\" (of suffering) or \"extinguished\", \"quieted\", \"calmed\"; it is also known as \"Awakening\" or \"Enlightenment\" in the West. The Four Noble Truths were the first teaching of Gautama Buddha after attaining Nirvana. They state that suffering is an inevitable part of life as we know it. The cause of this suffering is attachment to, or craving for worldly pleasures of all kinds and clinging to this very existence, our \"self\" and the things or people we—due to our delusions—deem the cause of our respective happiness or unhappiness. The suffering ends when the craving and desire ends, or one is freed from all desires by eliminating the delusions, reaches \"Enlightenment\".\n\nWhile greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable—it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral. In the Buddhist perspective, the enemy to be defeated is craving rather than desire in general.\n\nJacques Lacan's \"désir\" follows Freud's concept of \"Wunsch\" and it is central to Lacanian theories. For the aim of the talking cure—psychoanalysis—is precisely to lead the analysand or patient to uncover the truth about their desire, but this is only possible if that desire is articulated, or spoken. Lacan said that \"it is only once it is formulated, named in the presence of the other, that desire appears in the full sense of the term.\" \"That the subject should come to recognize and to name his/her desire, that is the efficacious action of analysis. But it is not a question of recognizing something which would be entirely given. In naming it, the subject creates, brings forth, a new presence in the world.\" \"[W]hat is important is to teach the subject to name, to articulate, to bring desire into existence.\" Now, although the truth about desire is somehow present in discourse, discourse can never articulate the whole truth about desire: whenever discourse attempts to articulate desire, there is always a leftover, a surplus.\n\nIn \"The Signification of the Phallus\" Lacan distinguishes desire from need and demand. Need is a biological instinct that is articulated in demand, yet demand has a double function, on one hand it articulates need and on the other acts as a demand for love. So, even after the need articulated in demand is satisfied, the demand for love remains unsatisfied and this leftover is desire. For Lacan \"desire is neither the appetite for satisfaction nor the demand for love, but the difference that results from the subtraction of the first from the second\" (article cited). Desire then is the surplus produced by the articulation of need in demand. Lacan adds that \"desire begins to take shape in the margin in which demand becomes separated from need.\" Hence desire can never be satisfied, or as Slavoj Žižek puts it \"desire's \"raison d'être\" is not to realize its goal, to find full satisfaction, but to reproduce itself as desire.\"\n\nIt is also important to distinguish between desire and the drives. Even though they both belong to the field of the Other (as opposed to love), desire is one, whereas the drives are many. The drives are the partial manifestations of a single force called desire (see \"The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis\"). If one can surmise that \"objet petit a\" is the object of desire, it is not the object towards which desire tends, but the cause of desire. For desire is not a relation to an object but a relation to a lack (manque). Then desire appears as a social construct since it is always constituted in a dialectical relationship.\n\n\n"}

The artist wrote '#pokemonument' in concrete near the work's base.\n\nWithin a few days, the sculpture was vandalized by someone with a baseball bat. It was repaired. Some two weeks after its placement, the \"Pokemonument\" was removed, and a statement by the anon artist placed online saying the artwork would be auctioned to benefit restoration of the park's fountains.\n\n"}
{"id": "5566470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5566470", "title": "Pokémon Trading Figure Game", "text": "Pokémon Trading Figure Game\n\nThe Pokémon Trading Figure Game (also referred to as the Pokémon TFG) is a collectible miniatures game similar to HeroClix. It is designed by Pokémon USA and based on Satoshi Tajiri's \"Pokémon\" media franchise.\n\nIt was released in Australia in August 2006, followed by releases in Europe and Southeast Asia later that year. The trading figures have been released in the United States and were released in Japan sometime in 2007. As of March 18, 2008 Mike Liesik announced that the Pokémon TFG will be included in Pokémon Trading Card Leagues so players can earn their rewards in new ways. The first set released is called \"Next Quest\". The game seems to be played in a luck/strategy format that resembles the boardgame Risk with most actions being controlled by a spin mechanism on the figures. The figures are larger than most other figure games, highly detailed, and meant to introduce this type of game to younger players while holding the interest of older fans of the Pokémon series.\n\nOn June 2, 2009, the Pokémon Trading Figure Game was confirmed to be discontinued.\n\nPokémon Duel, a free-to-play digital version of the Pokémon Trading Figure Game, was released for Android and iOS devices in April 2016.\n\nThe Pokémon Trading Figure Game was designed by Tsunekaz Ishihara, a general producer for Pokémon and one of the designers of the trading card game, with Kouichi Ooyama and Mr. Masayuki Miura. They spent several years preparing the game's look and feel to ensure the best possible trading figure game. They aimed at maintaining the spirit of the Pokémon through all the properties, but realized there would be some differences. The figures are designed and created by Kaiyodo, with help from the game designers.\n\nPlayers take turns moving their Pokémon around the playmat, attempting to get one of their Pokémon on the opponent's Goal. If their Pokémon stops next to an opposing Pokémon, they can choose to battle. In a battle, both players spin their own figures, and the best result wins. A single game can take place on the 3-on-3 playmat or the 6-on-6 playmat. The quick 3-on-3 version lets players explore the basic strategies of the game while the 6-on-6 playmat offers a wider variety of tactics. A player can spin a trainer figure, to use a boost card.\n\nThe \"Next Quest\" set is made up of 42 figures and 8 cards. These pieces are divided into four levels of rarity: white star (extremely rare), black star (rare), black diamond (uncommon) and black circle (common).\nThere are also 2 subsets: the pearl sub-set, which contains all the rare figures and are a pearly colour, and the crystal subset are see through and contains all the EXrare figures. A ref figure is also found in the 9 figure set it would appear it is not part of the nextquest set however as it has the promo symbol underneath.\n\nTwo starter sets are available for this collection, entitled \"Flamethrower\" and \"Riptide\". Each starter set contains four figures, as well as the following:\n\nThere are also four different booster packs available; these do not have individual names but are identified by the four different images on each packaging: Pikachu, Charizard, Groudon, and Feraligatr.\n\n\nThere are several differences between the International and US release.\n\nThe US release offers two types of starter sets and three types of booster packs. All retail packagings are made of printed cardboard and plastic clamshell. The 1-figure booster pack has one visible figure-spot. The 2-figure booster pack has one visible figure-spot, and one secret figure spot. The 3-figure booster pack has two visible figure-spots, and one secret figure-spot.\n\nThe visible figure-spot in the 1-figure booster pack contains either Groudon, Kyogre, Pikachu, Absol, Torchic, or Mudkip.\n\nThe visible figure-spot in the 2-figure booster pack and one of the visible figure-spot in the 3-figure booster pack contain either Ho-Oh, Lugia, Eevee, Salamence, or Zangoose. Scyther was later released as a visible figure in the Target-exclusive 3-figure booster pack.\n\nThe second visible figure-spot in the 3-figure booster pack originally contained the \"Pokémon Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" starters. A Target-exclusive release of the 3-figure booster pack has the starters replaced by crystal variations of the other visible figures.\n\nThe secret figure-spots in the 2-figure and 3-figure booster packs contain one random non-promotional figure from the Next Quest set. Red and Brendan trainer figures from the starter sets appear rarely in the secret figure-spot of the 3-figure booster packs.\n\nThe figures from the US release do not have figure rarity and rarity symbol.\n\nThe secret figure-spots from the US release booster packs always have one trainer card. All figures from the US release are sold with the spinner base, and the color of the spinner base in the secret figure-spot matches the color of the base in the visible figure-spot of the same pack.\n\nBeedrill figure from the US release has an additional support rod connecting between the Beedrill figure and the figure base.\n\n\"Groundbreakers\" would have been the first expansion set for the Pokémon Trading Figure Game. The expansion was to feature two starter sets, with one, \"Skydive,\" seeing an early release in Wal-Mart stores in November 2008. The other, \"Whirlwind,\" also saw a retail release. The full release of the set was delayed several times before the Pokémon Trading Figure Game was officially discontinued on June 2, 2009, leaving the set unreleased.\n\n"}
{"id": "51652572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51652572", "title": "Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims", "text": "Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims\n\nAfter a sexual assault or rape, victims are often subjected to scrutiny and, in some cases, mistreatment. Victims undergo medical examinations and are interviewed by police. If there is a criminal trial, victims suffer a loss of privacy and their credibility may be challenged. Victims may also become the target of slut-shaming, abuse, social stigmatization, sexual slurs and cyberbullying.\n\nVarious laws have been created with a motive to protect victims. During criminal proceedings, publication bans and rape shield laws protect victims from excessive public scrutiny. Laws may also prohibit defence lawyers from obtaining a victim's medical, psychiatric or therapeutic records. Statutory rape laws set the age of legal consent for sexual activity and prohibits perpetrators from alleging the victim consented to the activity. Victims in some jurisdictions can seek damages from police and institutions if warnings were not issued. Numerous victims' rights groups operate to improve the treatment of victims.\n\nExaminers may also collect fingernail scrapings and pluck head and pubic hairs. If the facility has the means, and the victim consents, the examiner will also take photographs of genital injuries. A 'rape kit' contains the items used by medical personnel for gathering and preserving physical evidence.\n\nMany \"rape kits\" are untested because they are never submitted to crime labs or because crime labs have insufficient resources to test all of the submitted kits. In the United States, national surveys of law enforcement agencies suggest there may be upwards of 200,000 untested rape kits.\n\nThe Survivors' Bill of Rights Act of 2016 was enacted by the United States federal government on October 7, 2016. The act gives victims the right: \n\nAs part of police investigations, victims are interviewed by police. The interview is usually recorded, a transcript may be prepared and the interview may be made available to the public. Discrepancies between the victim's statements to police and other evidence are grounds for the defence lawyer to impeach the credibility of the victim.\n\nIn investigations involving acquaintance or date rape, the electronic communications between the accused and the victim may be reviewed in order to determine if the victim consented to the sexual activity.\n\nIn \"People v. Jovanovic\", the New York appeals court determined that emails from the alleged victim should be included in evidence and that the rape shield law did not apply. The alleged victim had written about her sadomasochistic interests and experiences.\n\nIn Canada, a defense lawyer may be allowed to obtain copies of the victim's e-mails and other private documents using a legal procedure called a third-party records application.\n\nIf police believe the reported victim is making a false accusation of rape, they may interrogate that person as a suspect rather than a victim. In some cases, harsh questioning and social stigmatization has caused even actual victims of rape to recant and then be charged with making a false report.\n\nIn Canada, pursuant to sections 278.1 to 278.91 of the \"Criminal Code\" defence counsel are not allowed to obtain a victim's medical, psychiatric or therapeutic records . The prohibition was found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada even though it limited the accused ability to provide a full answer and defence; see \"R. v Mills\".\n\nAn accused may hire a private investigator to investigate and harass a victim. For example, according to the complaint in the civil lawsuit against Penn State University, Nate Parker hired a private investigator to investigate and harass an 18-year-old student. The student alleged she was raped by Parker and another student. The harassment included exposing the victim's identity by posting enlarged photos of the victim around the university campus. The lawsuit against Penn State was settled for $17,500.\n\nInstitutions may attempt to cover up sexual abuse, as seen in the Catholic Church sexual abuse cases. The movie \"Spotlight\" deals with the coverup of sexual abuse by Catholic priests.\n\nDennis Hastert allegedly promised to pay $5 million to his victim in exchange for agreeing not to discuss the sexual assaults.\n\nAuthorities may fail to investigate allegations of sexual assault because the victims are perceived to be unreliable witnesses.\n\nThe BBC One miniseries \"Three Girls\" deals with the systematic sexual abuse of young girls by a group of older Asian men in Rochdale. Authorities were slow to respond even though more than 100 referrals were made to the police and social services.\n\nHarvey Weinstein dispatched defense lawyers and publicists to undermine the credibility of his accusers.\n\nIn the United States, various legislation, government agencies, and initiatives have been created to deal with campus sexual assault. These include:\n\n\n\"The Hunting Ground\" is a critically acclaimed American documentary film about the incidence of sexual assault on college campuses in the United States. Its creators say college administrations are failing to respond adequately to claims of sexual assault, while its critics have countered that the film was based on misleading statistics and biased against the alleged perpetrator.\n\nSexual Assault in the military is more prevalent than outside of the military and it is frequently under reported. In the United States, Sexual Assault Prevention Response (SAPR) is a training program designated to educate military service members and provide support and treatment to service members and their families. Individuals are assigned to a SAPR Advocate to assist them with the different treatment options that are available to them and to educate them about their rights.\n\nThe \"Prison Rape Elimination Act\" is United States legislation enacted for the purpose of preventing sexual assaults in U.S. prisons. The legislation requires reporting and information gathering.\n\nIn the United States, laws prohibiting the publication of a victim's name have been found to be unconstitutional and struck down. In \"Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn\" , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled a Georgia statute that imposed civil liability on media for publishing a rape victim's name was unconstitutional. The Court stated: \"the First and Fourteenth Amendments command nothing less than that the States may not impose sanctions on the publication of truthful information contained in official court records open to public inspection.\" Also see \"Florida Star v. B. J. F.\", and \"State of Florida v. Globe Communications Corp.\", 648 So.2d 110 (Fla. 1994).\n\nIn Canada, the Canadian Press generally does not publish the names of alleged sexual assault victims without their consent. In addition, a court order may operate to prohibit publication. Pursuant to paragraph 486.4(1)(a) of the \"Criminal Code\", the court may make an order \"directing that any information that could identify the complainant or a witness\" not be published, broadcast or transmitted for any sexual offences. The victim has the option of waiving the publication ban.\n\nIn cases where the accused is under 18 years of age, the court may impose a publication ban to protect the privacy of the offender.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Savannah Dietrich was sexually assaulted by two teenagers. The court ordered Dietrich not to discuss the case and she was threatened to be found in contempt when she published the names of the perpetrators on social media.\n\nIn Canada, the section 110 of the \"Youth Criminal Justice Act\" generally prohibits the publication of the name of the offender if the offender was under the age of 18 at the time of the offence.\nThe police, colleges and universities may be required to warn the public that a sexual assault has occurred. Women should be warned of the risk they face and have the opportunity to take any specific measures to protect themselves from future attacks.\n\nVictims of sexual assault may sue for damages if warnings are not issued. In 1998, a sexual assault victim successfully sued the Toronto police for their failure to warn her that a serial rapist was active in her neighbourhood. The complainant in the Nate Parker case sued Pennsylvania State University for violating her Title IX rights.\n\nIn the United States, the Clery Act imposes fines on colleges and universities that fail to warn students of criminal activity on or near campuses. The law is named after Jeanne Clery, a 19-year-old Lehigh University student who was raped and murdered in her campus hall of residence in 1986. In relation to the Jerry Sandusky sexual abuse scandal, U.S. federal investigators are seeking to fine Penn State University $2.4 million for failing to warn of threats to the campus.\n\nTripAdvisor apologized for repeatedly deleting forum posts about a resort where the victim had been raped by a security guard.\n\nSelf-censorship is when publications or people self-censor themselves in order to withhold information to protect their image or avoid receiving backlash. Some instances include:\n\n\n\n\nVictims may incur various financial costs because of the sexual assault; for example, costs related to moving (to get away from the perpetrator), a new mattress, legal fees, lost wages, lost tuition fees, new clothing, therapy and medication.\n\nA statute of limitations law may preclude a victim from pressing criminal charges. Limitations periods vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, in Pennsylvania charges must be filed within 12 years of the assault.\n\nStatutory rape is sexual activity in which one of the individuals is below the age of consent. The age of consent is the age at which a young person is capable of consenting to sexual activity.\nThese laws were enacted to recognize the inherent power imbalance between adults and children and that children are incapable of giving true consent to sexual acts with adults. The laws protect children from undue influence, persuasion and manipulation.\n\nIn 2016, the Government of Turkey proposed legislation that would overturn a man conviction for child sex assault if they married their victim.\n\nDefence counsel may argue the victim consented to the sexual activity. Determining if the victim consented can be problematic when the victim is intoxicated. A Nova Scotia court found there was no sexual assault because the prosecution could not prove the sexual activity was non-consensual. In that case, the sexual activity occurred in the back of a taxi cab between a taxi driver and an intoxicated customer.\n\nIn 2011, Cindy Gladue bled to death from an 11-centimetre cut in her vagina. At trial, the accused said Ms. Gladue died after a night of consensual, rough sex in an Edmonton motel. He was acquitted. The case is being appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. \n\nIn Australia, Canada and the United States, the prior sexual history of the victim is generally not admissible as evidence during a criminal proceeding. These laws are referred to as rape shield laws.\n\nIn Canada, the constitutionality of the rape shield law was challenged on the grounds that it hampers a defendant's ability to present a defence. The law was found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada: see \"R v Darrach\".\n\nIn Canadian criminal proceedings, the Crown prosecutor does not act on behalf of the victim and is not the victim's lawyer.\n29. Who represents the victim during the trial? Should I get a lawyer to ensure that my rights are met during the trial?\nCrown counsel is not and can never function as the victim's lawyer. Although the Crown appears to be representing the interests of the victim, the Crown is the lawyer for the Queen and the government during the trial. In Canadian criminal cases, the harm is perceived to have been committed against the State. This is why cases are referred to as Regina v. Smith (or R. v. Smith), Regina being the Queen in Latin. The Crown is truly representing the society, of which you are a part. \n\nSexual assault cases commonly involve multiple complainants. In these cases, the defence is likely to apply for separate trials for each offence.\nJoinder of multiple counts is only permitted in certain circumstances.\n\nThe decision to have separate trials is discretionary and is exercised in order to prevent prejudice to the defendant. The threshold question for holding a joint trial is whether or not each complainant's evidence will be admissible in respect of the charges involving the other complainants (that is, whether such evidence is 'cross-admissible'). Decisions to hold separate trials or refuse to admit relevant tendency or propensity evidence about a defendant's sexual behaviour can be seen as barriers to the successful prosecution of sex offences.\n\nThe sexual assault charges against Jian Ghomeshi involved multiple complainants and were dealt with in two separate proceedings. The second trial did not proceed after Ghomeshi agreed to issue an apology.\n\nA victim of sexual assault may be subjected to speculative allegations of wrongdoing during cross-examination. For example, in \"R. v. Sofyan Boalag\" the defence lawyer asserted during the cross-examination that the victim was in fact asking for money in exchange for sex. In that case, the accused was convicted of 13 criminal offences involving six victims including multiple sexual assaults at knife point.\n\nA victim's alcohol consumption at the time of the assault may undermine the victim's ability to remember the assault and his or her ability to provide credible testimony. As noted by Justice Zuker of the Ontario Court of Justice: [414] What makes someone a perfect target in the context of alcohol-facilitated sexual assaults may make that person a poor witness in any ensuing proceedings due to his or her inability to remember part or all of what happened. \n[415] One of the more challenging (and ever-present) issues to evaluate in sexual assault is the question of consent. Sexual assaults may involve alcohol consumption by one or both parties. Frequently, parties to an incident will have limited or no memory of the events in question, and the court will be required to obtain and evaluate information provided by other witnesses or other corroborating evidence. \nDuring cross examination a victim's attire may be scrutinized and they may be accused of wearing revealing clothing. For example, a Toronto woman, who alleged she was sexually assaulted by three police officers after a party, was asked about her choice of wearing a top described as \"really low cut with open sleeves\" to a party mostly attended by \"young men ... who would be drinking.\"\n\nDuring cross-examination, a victim's criminal record may be noted in order to impeach their credibility. This tactic was unsuccessfully used in the trial of Daniel Holtzclaw.\n\nVictims of sexual assault are often subjected to social stigma. The victim may be subject to inappropriate post-assault behaviour or language by medical personnel or other organizations.\n\nSlut-shaming is the practice of blaming the victim for rape and other forms of sexual assault. It rests on the idea that sexual assault is caused (either in part or in full) by the woman wearing revealing clothing or acting in a sexually provocative manner, before refusing consent to sex, and thereby absolving the perpetrator of guilt.\n\nThe SlutWalk challenges the idea of explaining or excusing rape by referring to any aspect of a woman's appearance. The SlutWalk was created in response to comments by a Toronto Police officer who said: \"I've been told I'm not supposed to say this – however, women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized.\"\n\nIn 2016, Indian politicians suggested that women's clothing choices could invite sexual assault. The comments were made after a number of women were molested at a New Year's Eve party in Bangalore.\n\nOn the U.S. television program \"The View\", Joy Behar referred to Bill Clinton's sexual assault accusers as \"tramps\". Behar apologized for the sexual slur shortly afterwards.\n\nSexual assault victims may stay away from work in order to avoid contact with the perpetrator. For example, Caroline Lamarre, an office worker who was sexually assaulted at work, has not returned to work in order to avoid contact with her assailant. The assailant was convicted of sexual assault.\n\nVictims of sexual assault may be subjected to cyberbullying, as in the case of the suicide of Audrie Pott, suicide of Rehtaeh Parsons and sexual assault of Savannah Dietrich.\n\nThe Netflix documentary \"Audrie & Daisy\" is about two American high school students who were sexually assaulted by other students. At the time they were assaulted, Audrie Pott was 15 and Daisy Coleman was 14 years old. After the assaults, the victims and their families were subjected to abuse and cyberbullying.\n\nThe movie \"\" is the true story of Nancy Ziegenmeyer, an Iowa resident who was raped in 1991. Her story was groundbreaking because she spoke openly about her experiences including her interactions with hospital staff, the police, prosecutors, the accused, and the criminal justice system.\n\nThe Des Moines Register won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1991 for publishing the story of Nancy Ziegenmeyer's sexual assault. At the time the article was published it was unusual to publish the victim's name. Ziegenmeyer wrote a book, \"Taking Back My Life\", to encourage women to seek help after they've been victimized.\n\nIn many cultures, rape victims are at very high risk of suffering additional violence or threats of violence after the rape. These acts may be perpetrated by the rapist or by friends and relatives of the rapist as a way of preventing the victims from reporting the rape, of punishing them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint. In addition, the relatives of the victim may threaten the victim as a punishment for \"bringing shame\" to the family. This is especially the case in cultures where female virginity is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in honor killings.\n\nIn some countries, girls and women who are raped are forced by their families to marry their rapist. A marriage is arranged because victims are deemed to have their \"reputation\" tarnished. There is extreme social stigma related to being the victim of rape and the loss of virginity. Marriage is claimed to be advantageous for both the victim—who does not remain unmarried and doesn't lose social status—and of the rapist, who avoids punishment.\n\nIn 2012, the suicide of a 16-year-old Moroccan girl—who, after having been forced by her family to marry her rapist at the suggestion of the prosecutor, and who subsequently endured abuse by the rapist after they married—sparked protests from activists against the law which allows the rapist to marry the victim in order to escape criminal sanctions, and against this social practice which is common in Morocco.\n\nIn 2016, the government of Turkey introduced legislation which would overturn a man's conviction for child sex assault if he married his victim.\n\nVictims often receive support from the community and other victims. For example, when went public regarding her experience, \"she was inundated with letters and phone calls of support, thanks and praise for her courage in going public. Many of the letters were from women who had been raped and had lived with their secrets, often telling no one, often blaming themselves.\"\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the \"Giving Victims a Voice\" report was published in response to allegations of sexual abuse made against English DJ and BBC Television presenter Jimmy Savile. The Director of Public Prosecutions described the report as marking a \"watershed moment\" and apologised for \"shortcomings\" in the handling of prior abuse claims. The report's publication resulted in some highlighting what could be systemic failure because of the number of complainants and institutions identified, but others criticised it for treating allegations as facts.\n\nIn the United States, the Crime Victims' Rights Act grants rights to victims including the right to be reasonably protected from the accused. Similarly, in Canada the \"Canadian Victims Bill of Rights\" provides rights to victims.\n\nThere are victims' rights groups. Rise is an NGO working to implement a bill of rights for sexual assault victims. The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) is an American group which carries out programs to prevent sexual assault, help victims, and to ensure that rapists are brought to justice. The Victim Rights Law Center is an American non-profit organization that provides free legal services to victims of rape and sexual assault. In the United States, the Office on Violence Against Women works to administer justice and strengthen services for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. In South Africa, People Opposing Women Abuse (POWA) is a women's rights organisation that provides services and engages in advocacy to promote women's rights and improve women's quality of life.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2316015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316015", "title": "Stunning", "text": "Stunning\n\nStunning is the process of rendering animals immobile or unconscious, with or without killing the animal, when or immediately prior to slaughtering them for food.\n\nWithin the European Union, most animals slaughtered for human consumption are killed by cutting major blood vessels in the neck or thorax so that rapid blood loss occurs. After a certain degree of blood loss has occurred, the animal will become unconscious, and after a greater blood loss death will ensue. From the moment of cutting until the loss of consciousness, the animal can experience pain, stress and fear. Without stunning, the time between cutting through the major blood vessels and insensibility, as deduced from behavioural and brain response, is up to 20 seconds in sheep, up to 25 seconds in pigs, up to 2 minutes in cattle, up to 2.5 or more minutes in poultry, and sometimes 15 minutes or more in fish. If one wants to minimise animal suffering during slaughter, stunning is required. The best stunning method depends on the species of animal.\n\nA primitive form of stunning was used in premodern times in the case of cattle, which were poleaxed prior to being bled out. However, prior to humane slaughter pistols and electric stunners, pigs, sheep and other animals (including cattle) were simply struck while fully conscious.\n\nThe belief that this was unnecessarily cruel and painful to the animal being slaughtered eventually led to the compulsory adoption of stunning methods in many countries. One of the first campaigners on the matter was the eminent physician, Benjamin Ward Richardson, who spent many years of his later working life developing more humane methods of slaughter. As early as 1853, he designed a lethal chamber that would gas animals to death relatively painlessly, and he founded the Model Abattoir Society in 1882 to investigate and campaign for humane methods of slaughter. He even experimented with the use of electric current at the Royal Polytechnic Institution.\nThe development of stunning technologies occurred largely in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1911, the Council of Justice to Animals (later the Humane Slaughter Association) was created to improve the slaughter of livestock and address the killing of unwanted pets. In the early 1920s, the HSA introduced and demonstrated a mechanical stunner, which led to the adoption of humane stunning by many local authorities.\"\n\nThe HSA played a key role in the passage of the Slaughter of Animals Act 1933. This made the mechanical stunning of cows and electrical stunning of pigs compulsory, with the exception of Jewish and Muslim meat. Modern methods, such as the captive bolt pistol and electric tongs were required and the Act's wording specifically outlawed the poleaxe. The period was marked by the development of various innovations in slaughterhouse technologies, not all of them particularly long-lasting.\n\nIn modern slaughterhouses a variety of stunning methods are used on livestock. Methods include:\n\nElectrical stunning is done by sending an electric current through the brain and/or heart of the animal before slaughter. Current passing through the brain induces an immediate but non-fatal general convulsion that produces unconsciousness. Current passing through the heart produces an immediate cardiac arrest that also leads shortly to unconsciousness and death. It is a controversial subject however. With chickens for example, overstunning leads to bone fractures and/or electrocution which prevents bleeding of the animal. This negatively affects the quality of the meat, and therefore understunning is an attractive practice for slaughterhouses.\n\nIn the Netherlands, for example, the law states that poultry must be stunned for 4 seconds minimum with an average current of 100 mA, which leads to systematic understunning.\n\nThe CrustaStun is a device designed to administer a lethal electric shock to shellfish (such as lobsters, crabs, and crayfish) before cooking. This avoids boiling a live shellfish which may be able to experience pain in a way similar to vertebrates. The device works by applying a 110 volt, 2–5 amp electrical charge to the animal. It is reported the CrustaStun renders the shellfish unconscious in 0.3 seconds and kills the animal in 5 to 10 seconds, compared to 3 minutes to kill a lobster by boiling or 4.5 minutes for a crab.\n\nWith gas stunning animals are exposed to a mixture of breathing gases (carbon dioxide for example, but historically carbon monoxide was used) that produce unconsciousness or death through hypoxia or asphyxia. The process is not instantaneous.\n\nWith percussive stunning, a device which hits the animal on the head, with or without penetration, is employed. Such devices, such as the captive bolt pistol, can be either pneumatic, or powder-actuated. Percussive stunning produces immediate unconsciousness through brain trauma.\n\nStunning is regulated by the provisions of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (7 U.S.C. 1901), which the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is mandated to uphold under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 603 (b)). No similar provision exists in the Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957 (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.).\n\nAfter confirmation of the first U.S. BSE case, FSIS issued regulations (69 FR 1887, January 12, 2004) prohibiting the use of the most widely used stunning device (air-injection captive bolt stun gun) because the compressed air device (in contrast to the blank cartridge-driven or non-penetrating captive bolt) has been shown to force pieces of brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tissue into the bloodstream. Cattle blood is processed primarily for use as a protein supplement in animal feeds and milk replacer for calves, and could transmit BSE if it contained specified risk materials (SRMs include brain and CNS tissue).\n\n\n"}

Prior to becoming county medical examiner, Curphey had worked as a pathologist at St. John's Hospital in Brooklyn and Meadowbrook Hospital in East Meadow, New York. As Nassau County's Chief Medical Examiner he oversaw the autopsies of Robert L. Bacon, Janet Fay, Owen Davis, Jr., and William Woodward, Jr.. He also worked with the FBI to identify the fatalities of Northeast Airlines Flight 823. While working as Nassau County Medical Examiner, Curphey also served as the Chairman of the New York State Medical Society's Public Health and Education Committee, President of the Nassau County Medical Society, and Chairman of the Nassau County Committee of the American Cancer Society.\n\nOn March 19, 1957, Curphey was announced as the first Coroner of Los Angeles County. In his first year as coroner, he was involved in a dispute with local morticians over delay in issuing death certificates. In November 1958, Curphey's autopsy procedures were investigated by a grand jury, which accused him of misconduct. The charges against Curphey were later brought before the Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission, which promised him that no further complaints will be filed against him.\n\nCurphey was the chief coroner during the investigation into the death of Marilyn Monroe. On August 7, 1962, two days after her death, Curphey announced that a massive overdose of barbiturates was the cause of death. He later said she had lethal doses of both Nembutal or chloral hydrate and she could have been killed by either.\n\nCurphey also administered the autopsies of Jack Westrope, George Reeves, Davey Moore, Red Sanders, and Dorothy Dandridge.\n\nCurphey retired on October 25, 1967 from the Los Angeles County Coroner’s office.

{"id": "50902078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50902078", "title": "Totentanz (Adès)", "text": "Totentanz (Adès)\n\nTotentanz is a composition for baritone, mezzo-soprano, and orchestra by the British composer Thomas Adès. The work was commissioned by Robin Boyle in memory of the composer Witold Lutosławski and of his wife Danuta. Its world premiere was given in the Royal Albert Hall during The Proms on July 17, 2013 and was performed by the baritone Simon Keenlyside, the mezzo-soprano Christianne Stotijn, and the BBC Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Adès.\n\n\"Totentanz\" is cast in one continuous movement and has a duration of roughly 40 minutes.\n\n\"Totentanz\" is set to an anonymously authored text that appeared under a 15th-century frieze in St. Mary's Church, Lübeck, that was destroyed by a British air raid in World War II. In the score program notes, Adès wrote, \"the frieze depicted members of every category of human society in strictly descending order of status, from the Pope to a baby. In-between each human figure is an image of Death, dancing and inviting the humans to join him. In this setting, each of the humans in turn is represented by a low soprano, and Death by a baritone.\"\n\nThe work is scored for baritone, mezzo-soprano, and a large orchestra consisting of three flutes (1st and 2nd doubling piccolo; 3rd doubling piccolo and alto flute), three oboes (3rd doubling cor anglais), three clarinets (1st in B-flat and A, doubling E-flat clarinet); 2nd in A, doubling bass clarinet; 3rd in A, doubling bass clarinet with low C), three bassoons (2nd doubling contrabassoon; 3rd doubling contraforte or contrabassoon with low A), four horns, three trumpets (all doubling flugelhorn), two trombones, bass trombone, contrabass tuba, timpani (doubling rototoms), six to eight percussionists, harp, piano (doubling celesta), and strings.\n\n\"Totentanz\" has been highly praised by music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Ivan Hewett of \"The Daily Telegraph\" called it \"an immense achievement\" and compared it favorably to performances of Benjamin Britten's \"Sinfonia da Requiem\" and Witold Lutosławski's Cello Concerto, writing, \"On their own these two performances would have lifted this Prom into a different class. Then came something that raised it higher still; the world premiere of Thomas Adès's \"Totentanz\".\" Helen Wallace of \"BBC Music Magazine\" similarly opined, \"It hurls us into a labyrinth the senior composer would recognise, but which is darker and more manically brutal than anything even he conceived.\" The piece was also praised by Andrew Clements of \"The Guardian\", who wrote:\n\nReviewing the United States premiere, Martin Bernheimer of the \"Financial Times\" remarked, \"The 40-minute \"Totentanz\" [...] represents a clever dance of death predicated on harmonic, rhythmic and, occasionally, melodic complexity. The first half emerges essentially raucous, the second predominantly serene (everything, of course, is relative). Adès toys neatly with contrasting images of terror and resignation, manipulating a huge orchestral apparatus with virtuosic clarity amid percussive bombast.\" David Allen of \"The New York Times\" described the work as \"a grisly symphony-cantata for two singers and a vast orchestra that is his longest, most ambitious and most astounding orchestral composition yet.\" He added, \"Despite an imprecise performance here, it's clear that with \"Totentanz\", this composer takes a dizzying leap beyond his finest earlier scores — \"Asyla\" (1997) and \"Tevot\" (2007) — and adds to a lineage of musical death-dances, including those of Liszt and Saint-Saëns.\"\n\nHowever, George Grella of the \"New York Classical Review\" was slightly more critical of the piece. Despite describing it as Adés's \"most fully realized large-scale score to date,\" Grella nevertheless observed, \"\"Totentanz\" works musically, is fascinating and powerful throughout, though it’s [\"sic\"] language still is at one remove from touching the listener intimately. The piece makes clear what Adés is thinking, but while we hear what is in his head, we don’t necessarily feel it.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "217792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217792", "title": "Tricolour (flag)", "text": "Tricolour (flag)\n\nA tricolour or tricolor is a type of flag or banner design with a triband design which originated in the 16th century as a symbol of republicanism, liberty or indeed revolution. The flags of France, Italy, Romania, Mexico, and Ireland were all first adopted with the formation of an independent republic in the period of the French Revolution to the Revolutions of 1848, with the exception of the Irish tricolour, which dates from 1848 but was not popularised until the Easter Rising in 1916 and adopted in 1919.\n\nThe first association of the tricolour with republicanism is the orange-white-blue design of the Prince's Flag (\"Prinsenvlag\", predecessor of the flags of the Netherlands and Luxembourg), used from 1579 by William I of Orange-Nassau in the Eighty Years' War, establishing the independence of the Dutch Republic from the Spanish Empire.\nThough not the first tricolour flag, one of the most famous, known as \"Le Tricolore\", is the blue, white and red (whence also called \"Le Bleu-Blanc-Rouge\") flag of France adopted in the French Revolution.\n\nWith the formation of French client republics after 1795, the revolutionary tricolour was exported and adopted more widely in Europe, by \nthe Republic of Alba 1796 (red-blue-yellow),\nthe Cisalpine Republic 1797 (Transpadane Republic, green-white-red),\nthe Cisrhenian Republic 1797 (green-white-red),\nthe Anconine Republic 1797 (blue-yellow-red),\nthe Roman Republic 1798 (black-white-red),\nthe Helvetic Republic 1798 (green-yellow-red; canton of Neuchatel 1848), \nthe Parthenopean Republic 1799 (blue-yellow-red), \nthe Principality of Lucca and Piombino 1805 (blue-white-red). Thus providing the format for most of modern Europe's national flags, from the flag of Italy, to the flag of Germany, flag of Ireland, flag of Belgium, flag of Romania, flag of Bulgaria, flag of Moldova, and others around the World such as the flag of Cameroon, flag of Chad, flag of Ivory Coast, flag of Gabon, flag of Guinea, flag of Mali, and flag of Nigeria.\n\nThe green-white-red tricolour remained a symbol of republicanism throughout the 19th century and was adopted as national flag by a number of states following the Revolutions of 1848. It was also adopted by the Kingdom of Sardinia (inherited by the Kingdom of Italy 1861).\n\nThe flag of Germany (black-red-gold) originated as the flag of the revolutionary, anti-monarchist Freikorps of the 1830s and was later adopted by the republicanist bourgeoisie, at the time known as \"Dreifarb\", a German calque of \"Tricolore\". This flag was a symbol of opposition against the German \"Kleinstaaterei\" and the desire for German Unification. It was at first illegal in the German Confederation, but was adopted as the national flag at the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848/9. The flag of Belgium was introduced in a similar context, in 1831, its colours taken from the flag used in the Brabant Revolution of 1789.\nThe first national flag of the New World inspired by this symbolism was the flag of Mexico, adopted when the First Mexican Empire gained independence from Spain in 1821.\n\nAfter 1848, the young republican nation states continued to pick triband designs, but now more prevalently expressing the sentiment of nationalism or ethnic identity than anti-monarchism, the flag of Hungary (1848),\nthe flag of Romania (1848), \nthe Flag of Ireland (1848),\nthe flag of Estonia (1880s),\nthe flag of Lithuania (1905),\nand the flag of Armenia (1918). \nBy contrast, the flag of Russia was adopted by the Tsardom of Russia in the late 17th century and while it may or may not have been inspired by the Dutch tricolour, it never had any republican implications.\n\nThe political ideology of the unification of an ethnic nation state associated with tricolour flags since the 19th century has resulted in the design of new \"tricolours\" expressing specific nationalisms in the 20th century, \nthe Pan-African colours adopted in the 1920s for Pan-Africanism, chosen in numerous African flags during decolonisation (green-yellow-red, taken from the triband design used by the Solomonic dynasty for the Ethiopian Empire since 1897). The Pan-Arab colours adopted in Arab nationalism 1916 are a comparable concept, even though they combine four, not three, colours.\nAlso in the 20th century, Pan-Iranian colours for Iranian nationalism and Pan-Slavic colours for Slavic nationalism were adopted based on the triband design of the flags used during the 19th century by the Qajar dynasty and the Russian Empire, respectively.\n\nThe Indian independence movement in 1931 also adopted a tricolour (loan-translated as Hindi, तिरंगा \"Tiraṅgā\") in the traditional symbolism of \"national unification\" and republican \"self-rule\" (Purna Swaraj), adopted as the flag of the Indian Republic in 1947.\n\nIn 1999, a red, green, and blue tricolour was proposed as the Flag of Mars. The design symbolizes liberty, and also the terraforming of Mars by humanity from a red planet to a green one, and eventually an Earth-like blue one.\n\n"}

The film and its title character were produced to rival the success of Toho's \"Godzilla\" films during the mid-60s.\n\nThe name \"Yonggary\" is a combination of two Korean words: \"Yong\" (meaning dragon) and \"gari\" (derived from Bulgasari). The rights to the character are currently owned by Younggu Art, founded by Korean filmmaker Shim Hyung-rae, director of \"Yonggary\" (1999).\n\nThe 1967 Yonggary was originally conceived as a single-celled organism from space that mutated into a giant monster after exposure from radiation during a nuclear bomb test. The 1967 Yonggary was brought to life using a man in a rubber suit. Masao Yagi, who built the Gamera suit for Daiei, supervised the construction of the Yonggary suit. The character was designed in Korea, while the suit was built in Japan based on the Korean design. Director Kim Ki-duk found that the suit lacked terror and was disappointed with the final results but proceeded to film with the suit since there was no time or money to produce a new suit. The suit ended up costing ₩1.2 million ($5,000 in USD) to produce.\n\nCho Kyoung-min portrayed Yonggary, who was paid ₩100,000 ($400 in USD). The film and its title character were produced to rival the success of Toho's \"Godzilla\" and the film was released in Germany as Godzilla's Todespranke (Godzilla's Hand of Death).\n\nThe 1967 Yonggary has a bipedal reptilian design with a long horn on his snout, tusks at the side of his mouth, a single row of dorsal fins, and spikes on the side of his tail. The 1967 Yonggary is capable of breathing fire and his primary food source is oil and gasoline.\n\nIn the opening credits of the 2001 upgrade edition of \"Yonggary\", Shim Hyung-rae (the film's director) is credited as the creator of the 1999 incarnation of Yonggary. Miniatures and suits for Yonggary and Cyker were produced, but the suits were later replaced with Computer-generated imagery during post-production, thus the 1999 Yonggary is made nearly entirely out of CG effects. For the film's CG effects, the animators used a technique called the \"pipeline method\", Park Chang-yong (Younggu Art's Chief of 3D Animation) described it as \"A continuous process. It strives for large synergy effects by enhancing efficiency at all stages from 3D computer graphic modeling to rendering.\" The film ended up utilizing 45 minutes of computer graphics.\n\nThe 1999 Yonggary has a drastically different design from the original 1967 incarnation. The 1999 incarnation sports three horns on his head and the horn on his snout has been decreased to a smaller size. The 1999 Yonggary is also capable of breathing fire (referred to as \"fireballs\" in the film) and has a diamond-shaped receptor on his forehead that allow the aliens to control him. Under the aliens' control, Yonggary is shown to be aggressive and violent, but when the military breaks the aliens' control over Yonggary, he is shown to be a gentle creature, even going as far as to save people from being crushed by a collapsing building. While the 1967 Yonggary died, the 1999 incarnation is shown to live and is transported by the military to a deserted island to live in peace.\n\nIn 2000, Sonokong Korea releasing Reptilian as a \"DX Yonggary\" figure in as a theater exclusive in marketing the film on South Korea sold that figures. In 2008, graphic designer Hong Gi-hun (founder of South Korea's \"Big Monster Club\") created \"semi-official\" toys based on Korean monsters, such as the 1967 Yonggary, Pulgasari, and Wangmagwi. Though semi-official, Shim Hyung-rae still gave his blessing for the Yonggary toy and two sets of the toys were presented by film director Kim Ki-duk, director of the original \"Yongary, Monster from the Deep\" (1967).\n\n\n\n"}
