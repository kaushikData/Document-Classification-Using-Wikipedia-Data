{"id": "570922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=570922", "title": "Action at a distance", "text": "Action at a distance\n\nIn physics, action at a distance is the concept that an object can be moved, changed, or otherwise affected without being physically touched (as in mechanical contact) by another object. That is, it is the nonlocal interaction of objects that are separated in space.\n\nThis term was used most often in the context of early theories of gravity and electromagnetism to describe how an object responds to the influence of distant objects. For example, Coulomb's law and Newton's law of universal gravitation are such early theories. \n\nMore generally \"action at a distance\" describes the failure of early atomistic and mechanistic theories which sought to reduce all physical interaction to collision. The exploration and resolution of this problematic phenomenon led to significant developments in physics, from the concept of a field, to descriptions of quantum entanglement and the mediator particles of the Standard Model.\n\nEfforts to account for action at a distance in the theory of electromagnetism led to the development of the concept of a field which mediated interactions between currents and charges across empty space. According to field theory we account for the Coulomb (electrostatic) interaction between charged particles through the fact that charges produce around themselves an electric field, which can be felt by other charges as a force. Maxwell directly addressed the subject of action-at-a-distance in chapter 23 of his A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism in 1873. He began by reviewing the explanation of Ampere's formula given by Gauss and Weber. On page 437 he indicates the physicists' disgust with action at a distance. In 1845 Gauss wrote to Weber desiring \"action, not instantaneous, but propagated in time in a similar manner to that of light.\" This aspiration was developed by Maxwell with the theory of an electromagnetic field described by Maxwell's equations, which used the field to elegantly account for all electromagnetic interactions, as well as light (which, until then, had been seen as a completely unrelated phenomenon). In Maxwell's theory, the field is its own physical entity, carrying momenta and energy across space, and action-at-a-distance is only the apparent effect of local interactions of charges with their surrounding field.\n\nElectrodynamics was later described without fields (in Minkowski space) as the direct interaction of particles with lightlike separation vectors . This resulted in the Fokker-Tetrode-Schwarzschild action integral. This kind of electrodynamic theory is often called \"direct interaction\" to distinguish it from field theories where action at a distance is mediated by a localized field (localized in the sense that its dynamics are determined by the nearby field parameters). This description of electrodynamics, in contrast with Maxwell's theory, explains apparent action at a distance not by postulating a mediating entity (the field) but by appealing to the natural geometry of special relativity.\n\nDirect interaction electrodynamics is explicitly symmetrical in time, and avoids the infinite energy predicted in the field immediately surrounding point particles. Feynman and Wheeler have shown that it can account for radiation and radiative damping (which had been considered strong evidence for the independent existence of the field). However, various proofs, beginning with that of Dirac, have shown that direct interaction theories (under reasonable assumptions) do not admit Lagrangian or Hamiltonian formulations (these are the so-called No Interaction Theorems). Also significant is the measurement and theoretical description of the Lamb shift which strongly suggests that charged particles interact with their own field. Fields, because of these and other difficulties, have been elevated to the fundamental operators in QFT and modern physics has thus largely abandoned direct interaction theory.\n\nNewton's classical theory of gravity offered no prospect of identifying any mediator of gravitational interaction. His theory assumed that gravitation acts instantaneously, regardless of distance. Kepler's observations gave strong evidence that in planetary motion angular momentum is conserved. (The mathematical proof is only valid in the case of a Euclidean geometry.) Gravity is also known as a force of attraction between two objects because of their mass.\n\nFrom a Newtonian perspective, action at a distance can be regarded as: \"a phenomenon in which a change in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the intrinsic properties of a distant system, independently of the influence of any other systems on the distant system, and without there being a process that carries this influence contiguously in space and time\" (Berkovitz 2008).\n\nA related question, raised by Ernst Mach, was how rotating bodies know how much to bulge at the equator. This, it seems, requires an action-at-a-distance from distant matter, informing the rotating object about the state of the universe. Einstein coined the term Mach's principle for this question.\n\nFor further discussion see Ducheyne, S. Newton on Action at a Distance. Journal of the History of Philosophy vol. 52.4 (2014): 675-702.\n\nAccording to Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, \"instantaneous action at a distance\" violates the relativistic upper limit on speed of propagation of information. If one of the interacting objects were to suddenly be displaced from its position, the other object would feel its influence instantaneously, meaning information had been transmitted faster than the speed of light.\n\nOne of the conditions that a relativistic theory of gravitation must meet is that gravity is mediated with a speed that does not exceed , the speed of light in a vacuum. From the previous success of electrodynamics, it was foreseeable that the relativistic theory of gravitation would have to use the concept of a field, or something similar.\n\nThis has been achieved by Einstein's theory of general relativity, in which gravitational interaction is mediated by deformation of space-time geometry. Matter warps the geometry of space-time, and these effects are—as with electric and magnetic fields—propagated at the speed of light. Thus, in the presence of matter, space-time becomes non-Euclidean, resolving the apparent conflict between Newton's proof of the conservation of angular momentum and Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\nMach's question regarding the bulging of rotating bodies is resolved because local space-time geometry is informing a rotating body about the rest of the universe. In Newton's theory of motion, space acts on objects, but is not acted upon. In Einstein's theory of motion, matter acts upon space-time geometry, deforming it; and space-time geometry acts upon matter, by affecting the behavior of geodesics.\n\nAs a consequence, and unlike the classical theory, general relativity predicts that accelerating masses emit gravitational waves, i.e. disturbances in the curvature of spacetime that propagate outward at lightspeed. Their existence (like many other aspects of relativity) has been experimentally confirmed by astronomers—most dramatically in the direct detection of gravitational waves originating from a black hole merger when they passed through LIGO in 2015.\n\nSince the early twentieth century, quantum mechanics has posed new challenges for the view that physical processes should obey locality. Whether quantum entanglement counts as action-at-a-distance hinges on the nature of the wave function and decoherence, issues over which there is still considerable debate among scientists and philosophers. One important line of debate originated with Einstein, who challenged the idea that quantum mechanics offers a complete description of reality, along with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen. They proposed a thought experiment involving an entangled pair of observables with non-commuting operators (e.g. position and momentum).\n\nThis thought experiment, which came to be known as the EPR paradox, hinges on the principle of locality. A common presentation of the paradox is as follows: two particles interact and fly off in opposite directions. Even when the particles are so far apart that any classical interaction would be impossible (see principle of locality), a measurement of one particle nonetheless determines the corresponding result of a measurement of the other.\n\nAfter the EPR paper, several scientists such as de Broglie studied local hidden variables theories. In the 1960s John Bell derived an inequality that indicated a testable difference between the predictions of quantum mechanics and local hidden variables theories. To date, all experiments testing Bell-type inequalities in situations analogous to the EPR thought experiment have results consistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics, suggesting that local hidden variables theories can be ruled out. Whether or not this is interpreted as evidence for nonlocality depends on one's interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n\nNon-standard interpretations of quantum mechanics vary in their response to the EPR-type experiments. The Bohm interpretation gives an explanation based on nonlocal hidden variables for the correlations seen in entanglement. Many advocates of the many-worlds interpretation argue that it can explain these correlations in a way that does not require a violation of locality, by allowing measurements to have non-unique outcomes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15954278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15954278", "title": "Aftermath: Population Zero", "text": "Aftermath: Population Zero\n\nAftermath: Population Zero (also titled Aftermath: The World After Humans) is a two-hour Canadian special documentary film that premiered on Sunday, March 9, 2008 (at 8:00 PM ET/PT) on the National Geographic Channel. The program was produced by Cream Productions.\n\nSimilar to the History Channel's special \"Life After People\", \"Aftermath\" features what scientists and others speculate the earth, animal life, and plant life might be like if humanity no longer existed, as well as the effect that humanity's disappearance would have on the artifacts of civilization.\nBoth documentaries are inspired by Alan Weisman's \"The World Without Us\".\n\nA follow-up 4-part TV series was created, \"Aftermath\", following different scenarios and what happens.\n\nThe story begins on Friday, June 13, in an unspecified year. The nature of the show and the appearance of certain vehicles suggest that it takes place in 2008, the year the program was first aired (and when June 13 of that year did indeed fall on a Friday).\n\nA.H. = After Humans\n\nThe story speculates that humanity has disappeared instantly.\n\nMillions of empty cars spin out of control and crash, while others swerve off roads and highways. Other vehicles crash, including buses in Trafalgar Square. All empty vehicles eventually crash, causing accidents all across the globe. The highways are blocked with smashed and burning vehicles. Stationary cars continue to release exhaust fumes into the air until their fuel supplies run out. Cities have begun to cool down by a fraction of a degree. Small aircraft fall out of the sky, while larger ones remain in the air until their fuel runs out.\n\nComputer systems and machines stay operational. Satellites in orbit communicate with super-computers and continue to transmit information around the globe. The machines will keep going as long as the electricity stays on. But all the fuel is used up in coal power plants. The electricity runs out and the power plants shut down. Billions of buildings supplied that get their energy from them, such as Las Vegas casinos, fall into darkness. Entire suburbs go dark. Homes, schools, hospitals and cafes are now all without power.\n\nCertain regions rely on alternative energy sources, like Pennsylvania, which is powered by wind turbines. The turbines are still running, but at the local power station, the controls are unmanned. Computers detect a problem and shut down the system. Pennsylvania is now without electricity.\n\nAt Niagara Falls, Canada, water from the river is diverted into tunnels to turn massive wheels to create power, but now, the tunnels flood with excessive water and the power station goes offline. Parts of Ontario and New York lose all of their power. Televisions, computers, lights and other machines stop running. Mass blackouts sweep across the globe.\n\nWithin just one day, only nuclear power plants remain operational. The permanent loss of power reaches the nuclear power plants. Computers shut off the reactors and stop the reactions inside, but the nuclear power plants could cause a potential catastrophe.\n\nThe last power plants in Europe fail, and the last houses go dark as lights fail. Chemical plants now have no power. Many stored gases require electricity to be cold enough to stay in liquid form. Gas storage tanks heat up until pressure release valves are activated, sending toxic gases into the surrounding environment. Hundreds of thousands of venting tanks cause many animals in the affected regions to die of suffocation.\n\nHouses and apartments are still inhabited by family pets The domestic animals are getting hungry. Chained dogs try to get free. Cats and dogs raid refrigerators and cupboards for food and drink water from toilets. The global power loss reaches the world's zoos and safari parks, and starving animals test the fences. Without electric fencing to contain them, predators escape and explore this new world.\n\nAlso, liquefied natural gas plants are venting gases which reach stationary cars. Eventually, sparks ignite petrol in fuel tanks and the fuel catches fire. This causes huge explosions, igniting multiple fires that will rage for days.\n\nIn London, England, Big Ben rings for the last time. The clock tower needs to be wound every three days to remain ticking, but with no one to wind it, it finally grinds to a halt. In homes and apartments, domestic pets are starving. Now they must break out of their homes or starve to death.\n\nPet dogs and cats exhaust all the food in their homes and break out to search for more in the streets. Cats adapt quickly to hunting. Sewage treatment facilities fail without electricity, leaving sewage treatment plants useless. Raw sewage begins polluting rivers and lakes. Abandoned dogs struggle to survive.\n\nIn farms and pastures all over the world, dairy cows are struggling to survive as their food and water supplies begin to end. In a cruel twist of fate, 90,000 dairy cows are saved from the slaughterhouse, but most of their numbers will die of dehydration. Zoo animals face a similar fate as many will die trapped in their enclosures.\n\nSome exotic animals break out of their enclosures through disabled electric fences. Elephants start pruning the suburbs of vegetation in a desperate search for food, whilst hardier animals like camels browse on all available vegetation. Lions and tigers fan out into the streets to hunt but find hunting challenging in the city as they are not adapted for life in an urban setting.\n\nMigratory birds find travelling easier now since electric lights from office towers and skyscrapers do not confuse them anymore.\n\nAs days pass, domestic dogs eat all easily available food and begin to fight amongst each other for supremacy. The bigger dogs make packs and attack and eat the small ones. Within a week, all toy dogs disappear from Earth. Large packs of dogs also feed on dead penned up cattle.\n\nSecurity measures in power plants fail. The equipment in the spent fuel buildings adjoining nuclear power plants that maintain the temperature level of the spent nuclear fuel rods will shut down. Spent nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants is generally stored in pools in on-site facilities. Because the fossil fuel powered back up, power generators will run out. At that time, the cooling pools that prevent the spent nuclear fuel from overheating will start to boil since this water is not replenished.\n\nRadioactive steam will vent into the atmosphere due to the water eventually evaporating. The spent fuel will eventually set fire to the building, and the steam pressure will cause the storage facilities to explode, causing a (non nuclear) explosion, emitting radiation not only in the immediate area of the plant but around the globe due to winds. The resulting nuclear disasters spread fallout over large areas. This is repeated dozens of times as shutdown nuclear plants and spent fuel houses explode. Radioactive clouds cross the skies and rain carries the radiation to the ground. Most plants and smaller animals within the affected zones die. Larger animals (like deer) flee to unaffected regions, not because they notice the radiation, but because of the lack of food.\n\nHungry dogs from cities flee to the countryside to feast on dead dairy cows. Six days after their water and food supplies began ending, dairy cows have completely finished them and died. Now, their rotting carcasses will do nothing more than sustain hungry dogs. On the other hand, not all cows are dead. Beef cattle survive and form herds that thrive in places like the North American Great Plains and the open pastures in the middle-eastern U.S.\n\nThe last domestic chickens are exterminated by predators, while fowl such as some domestic game, guineas, and peafowl are still alive. Mice and rats take over abandoned supermarkets, where their population explodes thanks to the abundance of food. This pattern will continue for the next few months until the reduction of food and the action of predators like cats regulates their populations again. Squirrels, raccoons, coyotes and skunks begin to colonize human buildings.\n\nRadiation disappears from the air. In cities, air quality and visibility is improved. Packs of feral dogs roam the countryside. Desperate for food, they attack anything, even escaped elephants, but they don't have any success. Without humans, elephants have no real predators anymore. Meanwhile, the descendants of pet cats are thriving in supermarkets and grocery stores by feasting on mice and rats.\n\nWinter begins in the Northern Hemisphere. Zoo animals that cannot survive it, such as elephants, must migrate to southern latitudes or die. Meanwhile, without artificial heating, cockroaches die by the billions. Animals from the forests seek refuge in human homes. During their stay, they damage furniture in the buildings while constructing their own temporary homes to shelter from the cold.\n\nSpring rains wash away the radioactive particles from the surface and carry it further into the ground, cleaning plants and objects. Meanwhile, new plants and trees remove the artificial CO from the atmosphere as the new plants and flowers sprout in ruined cities and clean up greenhouses faster than in the human time. Without hunting seasons, animals breed undisturbed. Some species in areas with no natural predators, like the white tail deer, see population booms and expand their distribution to new areas, including former cities. Moss starts to grow over roads.\nLarge carnivores are human shy, but without the lights or noise made by humans they would penetrate urban areas from the nearby hills or reserves and hunt the domesticated animals. Also the houses may make wonderful dens, which means that animals like pumas and tigers would have population explosions. Depending on the area many common species, such as the White tailed deer would have population decreases due to loss of maintained food supply (e.g. lawns, golf courses, gardens) and increased predation.\n\nWith no maintenance and the ice of multiple winters, roads appear degraded and cracked. Moss covers their surfaces, and grass grows in the cracks. New trees grow in home gardens. Vehicles and other metallic structures begin to succumb to corrosion that strips away paint and protective coatings, resulting in rust that eats through metal. Many of the 1 billion automobiles will soon degrade into hollow husks.\n\nDevastated by solar winds, artificial satellites return to Earth in the form of shooting stars. Some of their pieces make it to the ground and start some fires. These satellites have been spiralling to Earth for the last 30 years but now, with the batteries dead and any stationkeeping fuel expended, atmospheric drag causes them to plummet to the ground.\n\nRoofs on houses collapse, allowing trees to grow in their interior. Many homes begin to collapse and fall apart as rotting walls and timbers succumb to rot and rain damage. Broken window panes that blew out long ago allow in dust and debris. Scoured by hurricane after hurricane, the East Coast of the United States is slowly cleaned of buildings. Southern states like Florida are completely swept away. In the ocean, the remains of former ships serve as foundations for the formation of coral reefs.\n\nCereal fields are turned into grasslands or overrun by expanding forests. The same happens to cities as grass and trees take root on streets and buildings. In New York City, Central Park is getting bigger, taking over Times Square where layers of mounting soil and plant growth cover up automobiles and the surrounding buildings. Panes of window glass fall from buildings to the streets as the clips holding the windows in their frames rust and crack.\n\nBirds of prey such as hawks and eagles make their nests and hunt rodents in skyscrapers. Paint is weathered away after years of exposure to rain. Metal in cars and other human structures is exposed to oxidation and disintegration. Packs of feral dogs roam the crumbling cities whilst more exotic additions, such as tigers, return and thrive. Large animals are thriving once more in the ruins of cities. Moisture causes concrete to collapse.\n\nIn northern cities, gutted skyscrapers and buildings are filled with rainwater and snow. Rain pours through floors and rots ceilings. The changing seasons only adds pressure to the buildings. Rainwater seeps into cracks in concrete columns, pillars, and walls, and then it freezes in winter before thawing again in spring. These repeated freeze-thaw cycles split and crack concrete. Metal bars inside concrete gave it its strength, but when water reaches the bars, they expand and crack the concrete. Finally, the support columns give way and the buildings topple. The upper floors rain down, smashing lower floors until the buildings crumble to the ground. Most buildings suffer the same fate. Skyscrapers around the world begin to collapse. Concrete structures such as train stations begin to fall down as the roofs give way and the support columns break.\n\nSea life has completely recovered from overfishing and thrives. Though there are still dogs, specific dog breeds do not exist anymore, erased by generations of free reproduction, with a wide variety of mixed-breeds and mongrels taking their place. In Europe, the largely decreased wolf population expands into the countries where it was completely exterminated. Upon reaching the ruins of cities, wolves come into contact with feral dogs, competing with them for food and breeding with them, erasing the last traces of domestication. There they hunt deer that are expanding their territories into cities now overtaken by grasses and tree growth.\n\nMost cars have now fallen apart. Synthetic plastic and rubber tires could last for centuries, whilst the body rusts, and the interior and seats disintegrate and fall apart.\n\nThe oceans and plants begin scrubbing the Earth clean of anthropogenic carbon dioxide.\n\nWinters are colder than in the last days of the human race. Northern cities like Vancouver are slowly buried under layers of building snow and ice. Remains of ships and bridges form dams in the Thames, flooding the ruins of London and turning the British capital back into the swamp it was before Roman times. The Houses of Parliament and the Clock Tower of Big Ben still stand amongst the marshy ruins. Cattle and frogs thrive. Imperial Valley, once the biggest producer of fruits in the United States, returns to a sandy desert. The fruits and vegetable crops grown here were irrigated with water pumped in through a pipe system from the Colorado River, but now the piping has been dry for over a century and the crop fields have been lost. The buildings in the region still stand, but all the wheat crops have withered away. Dry winds still maintain most of Las Vegas's buildings intact. After the power went off, the fountains, taps, and pools ran dry, and with only a few inches of rainfall a year, desert sands are beginning to sweep in and engulf the city. They serve as a refuge for vultures and desert lizards now.\n\nExcessive water pressure destroys most of the dams on the Colorado River. The Hoover Dam still survives. Over 300 miles behind it, lies the Glen Canyon Dam. In spring, rising temperatures trigger surging floodwater from melting snow and ice that races towards the dam. It reaches the Glen Canyon Dam, the spillways let some of the water out, but the tunnels built into the dam fill with high pressure bubbles that cause high pressure explosions and eat through the dam. Concrete ramps once prevented this, but now they have rusted into wrecks combined with water seeping through the cracks causing erosion. This causes the dam to ultimately collapse. the flood races downstream towards the Hoover Dam. The flood simply flows over the dam, forming a roaring cascade of water that thunders downstream, sweeping away other dams and overwhelming everything in the way. For the first time in centuries, the Colorado River once again reaches the Gulf of California as a flood, not a stream, and revitalizes to a vast estuary full of animal life.\n\nThe coast of Louisiana is reshaped as the Mississippi River is freed from the dams' grip. Old codfish reach six feet long. All whale species have recovered to their pre-human populations. Without the interference of noisy naval alarms, they can hear the mating calls of other whales from 2000 miles away. Remains of large ships appear on beaches all over the world after two centuries of errant journeys over (and under) the waves. Plants and trees completely eliminate the excess CO in the atmosphere.\n\nCorrosion from rainwater, ice and lightning strikes has completely ravaged the upper half of the Eiffel Tower, and the iron is rusted through and teetering. A strong wind collapses it, and falls into the new marsh on the River Seine that has flooded the remnants of Paris. Thousands of wild boar (descendants of both the domestic pig and wild boar) live under the Tower's legs. The right arm of the Statue of Liberty falls to the ground. The head cracks off and follows the arm some time later. The iron that makes up its skeleton has rusted through, and both parts were too weak to stay up, but its skin of copper plates is cleaner now than before due to cleaner skies and less tarnishing.\n\nThick forests of trees over 90 feet tall completely cover the eastern half of North America. Human structures still survive under forest humus. From time to time rains and rivers wash away humus, uncovering concrete beams, plastics, cellphones and stainless steel objects. Tens of millions of reindeer, bison, cattle and horses make up gigantic herds in the Western North American plains. The Great Sphinx of Giza is buried again in the sands of the Sahara to survive for thousands of years in preservation, just as it had done for thousands of years before it was rediscovered for the first time.\n\nForests return to the state they had 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower has lost all but its four legs. The rest of it has fallen down and been covered by soil and vegetation. The Statue of Liberty has fallen to pieces, and only its pedestal still stands, but this concrete pedestal could last thousands of years.\n\nEarth enters a new Ice Age, and glaciers expand south covering most of the Northern Hemisphere. The last traces of New York City are completely erased. Most species however adapt and thrive; sea lions, ducks, camels, fish, ostriches, lions, tigers, bison, baboons, deer, wolves, horses, cattle, and elephants all adapt alongside many other species. However, evidence left by Moon exploration missions and certain plastic items will survive intact for not only thousands, but millions of years after mankind has vanished. They will be the last legacy of the human race.\n\n\nAs with \"Life After People\", the similar special feature on the History Channel, \"Aftermath\" does not explain how humanity disappeared but rather what would happen to the Earth after we disappeared. It also shows that humans have disappeared instantly, not a few at a time. Both series depict the possible fates of famous pieces of infrastructure and buildings. It, too, uses CGI dramatizations to depict the possible fate of such icons as the Statue of Liberty and, in both programs, the Eiffel Tower and Hoover Dam. However, it does not emphasize this as much as \"Life After People\" does, following much more closely the effects on the natural world and its recovery after mankind departs the scene.\n\nIn addition, unlike \"Life After People\", \"Aftermath\" depicts what would happen if various modes of transportation, such as automobiles, planes, and trains, are abandoned in mid-motion when their passengers and operators instantly disappear, not unlike the Rapture in Christian eschatology. \"Life After People\", on the other hand, allows the possibility that instead of mysteriously vanishing the human race disappears with a mundane explanation, for example a pandemic or a global evacuation of Earth.\n\n\"Aftermath\" also shows what would happen if a nuclear power plant's spent fuel rods are left without the cooling equipment governing its condition. \"Life After People\" suggest that nuclear power plants would safely shut down with no ill effects, with no mention of what would happen to spent fuel rods in storage. However, in an episode of \"Life After People: The Series\", \"Toxic Revenge\", spent fuel rods are shown heating up and exploding the reactors containing it within ten days of humanity's disappearance. \"Aftermath\" also shows that the nuclear power plants themselves would shut down without incident, but the spent fuel rod storage in separate buildings would eventually blow up and spread radiation into the air and the surrounding countryside after the backup safety devices fail. \"Life After People\" also does not mention the release of poisonous gas from chemical plants when their safety features fail, lacking the fuel to run them. \"Life After People\" does talk about the Hoover Dam still generating power after people, but neither show talks about the things powered by batteries and solar power. In the \"Life After People\" episode, \"Crypt of Civilization\", watches with batteries are shown to last at least a year after us. In another episode, \"Waves of Devastation\", one of the landmarks the episode centers around is the ferris wheel on the Santa Monica Pier that features LED lights that run automatically at night. In another episode, \"Sin City Meltdown\", Springs Preserve's visitor center in Las Vegas is powered by the sun, and so the recorded voices of man still echo until ten years after people, when silt accumulated on the solar panels causes them to malfunction and shut off the voice of humans for good.\n\n\"Aftermath\" does not talk about the International Space Station while \"Life After People\" discusses the fate of the Immortality Drive aboard the ISS. Both documentaries make reference to objects on the Moon, although \"Life After People\" does this as part of the miniseries episode \"Roads to Nowhere\". Unlike \"Life After People\", \"Aftermath\" does not comment on the Voyager 2 spacecraft. The \"Life After People\" episode \"Sky's The Limit\" mentions the Cassini–Huygens Space orbiter. However no other space probes were noted. It should however be noted that the original \"Life After People\" documentary made reference to humanity's radio communications in space.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "396138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=396138", "title": "Anne Perry", "text": "Anne Perry\n\nAnne Perry (born Juliet Marion Hulme; 28 October 1938) is an English author of historical detective fiction, best known for her Thomas Pitt and William Monk series. In 1954, at the age of fifteen, she was convicted of participating in the murder of her friend's mother. She changed her name after serving her five-year sentence.\n\nBorn in Blackheath, London, the daughter of physicist Dr. Henry Rainsford Hulme, Perry was diagnosed with tuberculosis as a child and sent to the Caribbean and South Africa in hopes that a warmer climate would improve her health. A 1948 \"Auckland Star\" photograph of Juliet arriving in New Zealand was discovered by Auckland Libraries staff and written about in the Heritage et AL blog. She rejoined her family when she was 13 after her father took a position as Rector of Canterbury University College in New Zealand. She attended Christchurch Girls' High School, located in what became the Cranmer Centre.\n\nIn June 1954, at the age of 15, Hulme and her best friend Pauline Parker murdered Parker's mother, Honorah Rieper. Hulme's parents were in the process of separating and she was supposed to go to South Africa to stay with a relative. The two teenage friends, who had created a rich fantasy life together populated with famous actors such as James Mason and Orson Welles, did not want to be separated.\n\nOn 22 June 1954, the girls and Honorah Rieper went for a walk in Victoria Park in their hometown of Christchurch. On an isolated path Hulme dropped an ornamental stone so that Rieper would lean over to retrieve it. Parker had planned to hit her mother with half a brick wrapped in a stocking. The girls presumed that one blow would kill her but it took more than 20.\n\nParker and Hulme stood trial in Christchurch in 1954 and were found guilty on 29 August that year. As they were too young to be considered for the death penalty under New Zealand law at the time, they were convicted and sentenced to be \"detained at Her Majesty's pleasure\". In practice they were detained at the discretion of the Minister of Justice. They were released separately five years later.\n\nParker and Hulme are not believed to have had any contact since the trial.\n\nThe events formed the basis for the 1994 film \"Heavenly Creatures\", in which Melanie Lynskey portrayed a teenage Pauline Parker and Kate Winslet the teenaged Juliet Hulme. At the time of the film's release, it was not generally known that mystery author \"Anne Perry\" was Juliet Hulme, whose identity was made public some months after the film's release. Although some presumed Hulme and Parker's relationship to be sexual, Perry stated in 2006 that, while the relationship was obsessive, the two \"were never lesbians\".\n\nAfter being released from prison in November 1959, Hulme returned to England and became a flight attendant. For a period she lived in the United States, where she joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1968. She later settled in the Scottish village of Portmahomack where she lived with her mother. Her father had a distinguished scientific career, heading the British hydrogen bomb programme.\n\nHulme took the name Anne Perry, using her stepfather's surname. Her first novel, \"The Cater Street Hangman\", was published under this name in 1979. Her works generally fall into one of several categories of genre fiction, including historical murder mysteries and detective fiction. Many feature recurring characters, most importantly Thomas Pitt, who appeared in her first novel, and amnesiac private investigator William Monk, who first appeared in her 1990 novel \"The Face of a Stranger\". By 2003 she had published 47 novels, and several collections of short stories. Her story \"Heroes\", which first appeared in the 1999 anthology \"Murder and Obsession\", edited by Otto Penzler, won the 2001 Edgar Award for Best Short Story.\n\nIn 2005, Perry appeared on the \"Trisha\" show to discuss the crime on a special themed show.

Thomas Pitt is matched with Charlotte; her female society relatives help in the mysteries out of boredom. William Monk is matched with Hester Latterly, a Crimean War nurse.

{"id": "118571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=118571", "title": "Avalon", "text": "Avalon\n\nAvalon (; , Old French \"Avalon\", ; literally meaning \"the isle of fruit [or apple] trees\") is a legendary island featured in the Arthurian legend. It first appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's 1136 pseudo-historical account \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (\"The History of the Kings of Britain\") as the place where King Arthur's sword Excalibur was forged and later where Arthur was taken to recover from his wounds after the Battle of Camlann. Avalon was associated from an early date with mystical practices and figures such as Morgan le Fay. It is traditionally identified as the former island of Glastonbury Tor.\n\nGeoffrey of Monmouth referred to it in Latin as \"Insula Avallonis\" in \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (c. 1136). In the later \"Vita Merlini\" (c. 1150) he called it \"Insula Pomorum\" the \"isle of fruit trees\" (from Latin \"pōmus\" \"fruit tree\"). The name is generally considered to be of Welsh origin (though an Old Cornish or Old Breton origin is also possible), derived from Old Welsh, Old Cornish, or Old Breton \"aball\" or \"avallen(n)\", \"apple tree, fruit tree\" (cf. \"afall\" in Modern Welsh, derived from Common Celtic *\"abalnā\", literally \"fruit-bearing (thing)\"). It is also possible that the tradition of an \"apple\" island among the British was related to Irish legends concerning the otherworld island home of Manannán mac Lir and Lugh, Emain Ablach (also the Old Irish poetic name for the Isle of Man), where \"Ablach\" means \"Having Apple Trees\" – derived from Old Irish \"aball\" (\"apple\")—and is similar to the Middle Welsh name \"Afallach\", which was used to replace the name Avalon in medieval Welsh translations of French and Latin Arthurian tales. All are etymologically related to the Gaulish root *\"aballo\" \"fruit tree\" - (as found in the place name Aballo/Aballone) and are derived from a Common Celtic *\"abal\"- \"apple\", which is related at the Proto-Indo-European level to English \"apple\", Russian \"яблоко\" (\"jabloko\"), Latvian \"ābols\", et al.\n\nAccording to Geoffrey in \"Historia\", and much subsequent literature which he inspired, Avalon is the place where King Arthur is taken after fighting Mordred at the Battle of Camlann to recover from his wounds. Welsh, Cornish and Breton tradition claimed that Arthur had never really died, but would return to lead his people against their enemies. \"Historia\" also states that Avalon is where his sword Excalibur was forged.\n\nGeoffrey dealt with Avalon in more detail in \"Vita Merlini\", in which he describes for the first time in Arthurian legend the enchantress Morgan (\"Morgen\") as the chief of nine sisters (Moronoe, Mazoe, Gliten, Glitonea, Gliton, Tyronoe, Thiten and Thiton) who rule Avalon. Geoffrey's description of the island indicates a sea voyage was needed to get there. His description of Avalon here, which is heavily indebted to the early medieval Spanish scholar Isidore of Seville (being mostly derived from the section on famous islands in Isidore's famous work \"Etymologiae\", XIV.6.8 \"Fortunatae Insulae\"), shows the magical nature of the island:\n\nIn \"Erec and Enide\" by Chrétien de Troyes, the consort of Morgan is the Lord of the Isle of Avalon, Arthur's nephew named Guinguemar (a derivative of the legendary Breton hero Guingamor). In Layamon's \"Brut\", Arthur is taken to Avalon to be healed there (by means of magic water) by a more supernatural and distinctively Anglo-Saxon redefinition of Geoffrey's Morgen: an elf queen of Avalon named Argante.\n\nSome later versions of the Arthurian legend (including the best-known, \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" by Thomas Malory) have Morgan (by this time Arthur's sister in the narrative) and some other ladies (magical queens or enchantresses, sometimes with the Lady of the Lake among them; other may include the Queens of Eastland, the Northgales, the Outer Isles, and the Wasteland) arrive after the battle to take the mortally wounded Arthur from Camlann to Avalon on a black boat. In the Spanish summary of the Post-Vulgate \"Roman du Graal\" by Lope Garcia de Salazar, Morgan then uses her magic to hide Avalon in mist. Arthur's fate is usually left untold; in the Stanzaic \"Morte Arthur\", the Archbishop of Canterbury later receives Arthur's dead body and buries it at Glastonbury. Conversely, Stephen of Rouen's chronicle \"Draco Normannicus\" contains a fictional letter from King Arthur to Henry II of England, in which Arthur claims that he has been healed of his wounds and made immortal by his \"deathless/eternal nymph\" sister Morgan on Avalon, using the island's restorative herbs.\n\nMorgan also features as an immortal ruler of a fantastic Avalon, sometimes alongside the still alive Arthur, in some subsequent and otherwise non-Arthurian chivalric romances such as \"Tirant lo Blanch\", as well as the tales of Huon of Bordeaux, where Oberon is a son of either Morgan by name or \"the Lady of the Secret Isle\", and the legend of Ogier the Dane, where Avalon can be described as a castle. In his \"La Faula\", Guillem de Torroella claims to have visited the Enchanted Island (\"Illa Encantada\") and met Arthur who has been brought back to life by Morgan and they both of them are now forever young, sustained by the Holy Grail. In the \"chanson de geste\" \"La Bataille Loquifer\", Morgan and her sister Marsion (Marrion) bring the hero Renoart to Avalon, where Arthur now prepares his return alongside Morgan, Gawain, Ywain, Percival and Guinevere. Such stories take place centuries after the times of King Arthur.\n\nAround 1190, Avalon became associated with Glastonbury, when monks at Glastonbury Abbey claimed to have discovered the bones of Arthur and Guinevere. The works of Gerald of Wales make the first known connection:\n\nThough no longer an island in the 12th century, the high conical bulk of Glastonbury Tor had been surrounded by marsh before the surrounding fenland in the Somerset Levels was drained. In ancient times, Ponter's Ball Dyke would have guarded the only entrance to the island. The Romans eventually built another road to the island. Gerald wrote that Glastonbury's earliest name in Welsh was \"Ineswitrin\" (or \"Ynys Witrin\"), the Isle of Glass, a name noted by earlier historians which suggests that the location was at one point seen as an island.\n\nThe discovery of the burial is described by chroniclers, notably Gerald, as being just after King Henry II's reign when the new abbot of Glastonbury, Henry de Sully, commissioned a search of the abbey grounds. At a depth of 5 m (16 feet) the monks were said to have discovered a massive treetrunk coffin and a lead cross bearing the inscription:\n\nAccounts of the exact inscription vary, with five different versions existing. The earliest is by Gerald in \"Liber de Principis instructione\" c. 1193, who wrote that he viewed the cross in person and traced the lettering. His transcript reads: \"Here lies buried the famous \"Arthurus\" with \"Wenneveria\" his second wife in the isle of Avalon.\" Inside the coffin were two bodies, whom Giraldus refers to as Arthur and \"his queen\"; the bones of the male body were described as being gigantic. The account of the burial by the chronicle of Margam Abbey says three bodies were found, the other being that of Mordred: Richard Barber argues that his name was airbrushed out of the story once his reputation as a traitor was appreciated.\n\nIn 1278, the remains were reburied with great ceremony, attended by King Edward I and his queen, before the High Altar at Glastonbury Abbey. They were moved again in 1368 when the choir was extended. The site became the focus of pilgrimages until the dissolution of the abbey in 1539.\n\nThe story is today seen as an example of pseudoarchaeology. Historians generally dismiss the authenticity of the find, attributing it to a publicity stunt performed to raise funds to repair the Abbey, which was mostly burned in 1184.\n\nThe fact that the search for the body is connected to Henry II and Edward I, both kings who fought major Anglo-Welsh wars, has had scholars suggest that propaganda may have played a part as well. Gerald was a constant supporter of royal authority; in his account of the discovery clearly aims to destroy the idea of the possibility of King Arthur's messianic return:\n\nThe burial discovery ensured that in later romances, histories based on them and in the popular imagination Glastonbury became increasingly identified with Avalon, an identification that continues strongly today. The later development of the legends of the Holy Grail and Joseph of Arimathea by Robert de Boron interconnected these legends with Glastonbury and with Avalon, an identification which also seems to be made in \"Perlesvaus\". The popularity of Arthurian romances has meant this area of the Somerset Levels has today become popularly described as the Vale of Avalon.\n\nIn more recent times, writers such as Dion Fortune, John Michell, Nicholas Mann and Geoffrey Ashe have formed theories based on perceived connections between Glastonbury and Celtic legends of the Otherworld in attempts to link the location firmly with Avalon, drawing on the various legends based on Glastonbury Tor as well as drawing on ideas like Earth mysteries, Ley lines and even the myth of Atlantis. Arthurian literature also continues to use Glastonbury as an important location as in \"The Mists of Avalon\", \"A Glastonbury Romance\", and \"The Bones of Avalon\". Even the fact that Somerset has many apple orchards has been drawn in to support the connection.\n\nGlastonbury's connection to Avalon continues to make it a site of tourism and the area has great religious significance for Neo-Pagans, Neo-Druids and as a New Age community, as well as Christians. Hippy identification of Glastonbury with Avalon seen in the work of Michell and in Gandalf's Garden also helped inspire the Glastonbury Festival. \n\nIn medieval times suggestions for the location of Avalon ranged far beyond Glastonbury. They included paradisal underworld realms equated with the other side of the Earth at the antipodes, Mongibel in Sicily, and other unnamed locations in the Mediterranean.\n\nIn more recent times, just like in the quest for Arthur's mythical capital Camelot, a large number of locations have been put forward as being the real \"Avalon\". Ashe suggests an association of Avalon with the town of Avallon in Burgundy, as part of a theory connecting King Arthur to the Romano-British leader Riothamus who campaigned in that area.\n\n\n\n"}

A person possessing the beatific vision reaches, as a member of redeemed humanity in the communion of saints, perfect salvation in its entirety, i.e. heaven. The notion of vision stresses the intellectual component of salvation, though it encompasses the whole of human experience of joy, happiness coming from seeing God finally face to face and not imperfectly through faith. (1 Cor 13:11–12).\n\nIt is related to the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox belief in theosis, the Wesleyan notion of Christian perfection, and is seen in most – if not all – church denominations as the reward for Christians in the afterlife.\n\nIn Christianity, the Bible teaches that God \"dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has even seen or can see\" (1 Timothy 6:16), but when God reveals Himself to us in heaven we will then see Him \"face to face\" (1 Corinthians 13:12). This concept has been termed \"the beatific vision of God\" by theologians of the Catholic Church as well as various Protestant denominations, including the Lutheran Church and the Methodist Church.\n\nSaint Cyprian wrote of the saved's seeing God in the Kingdom of Heaven.\nHow great will your glory and happiness be, to be allowed to see God, to be honored with sharing the joy of salvation and eternal light with Christ your Lord and God... to delight in the joy of immortality in the Kingdom of Heaven with the righteous and God's friends!\n\nMonsignor Edward A. Pace in the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" (1907) defined the Beatific Vision:\nThe immediate knowledge of God which the angelic spirits and the souls of the just enjoy in Heaven. It is called \"vision\" to distinguish it from the mediate knowledge of God which the human mind may attain in the present life. And since in beholding God face to face the created intelligence finds perfect happiness, the vision is termed \"beatific.\"\n\nMethodist co-founder Charles Wesley, in his 1747 hymn \"Maker, in Whom We Live,\" described union with God through the Holy Spirit as \"beatific sight\":\nSpirit of Holiness, let all thy saints adore / thy sacred energy, and bless thine heart-renewing power. / No angel tongues can tell thy love's ecstatic height, / the glorious joy unspeakable, the beatific sight.\n\nIn Catholic theology, the intercession of saints is valid because those who have died in the Faith are with God in Heaven and enjoy the Beatific Vision, i.e., unmediated access to God's Presence, actually in Paradise itself, seeing God.\n\nThomas Aquinas defined the beatific vision as the human being's \"final end\" in which one attains to a perfect happiness. Thomas reasons that one is perfectly happy only when all one's desires are perfectly satisfied, to the degree that happiness could not increase and could not be lost. \"Man is not perfectly happy, so long as something remains for him to desire and seek.\"STh I–II, q., 3, a. 8. But this kind of perfect happiness cannot be found in any physical pleasure, any amount of worldly power, any degree of temporal fame or honor, or indeed in any finite reality. It can only be found in something that is infinite and perfect – and this is God. STh I–II, q. 2, a. 8. And since God is not a material thing but is pure spirit, we are united to God by knowing and loving him. Consequently, the most perfect union with God is the most perfect human happiness and the goal of the whole of the human life. But we cannot attain to this happiness by our own natural powers; it is a gift that must be given us by God, who strengthens us by the \"light of glory\" so that we can see him as he is, without any intermediary. (Thomas quotes Psalm 36:9 on this point: \"In your light we shall see light.\")STh I, q. 12, a. 4. Further, since every created image or likeness of God (including even the most perfect \"ideas\" or \"images\" of God we might generate in our minds) is necessarily finite, it would thus be infinitely less than God himself.STh I, q. 12, a. 2. The only perfect and infinite good, therefore, is God himself, which is why Aquinas argues that our perfect happiness and final end can only be the direct union with God himself and not with any created image of him. This union comes about by a kind of \"seeing\" perfectly the divine essence itself, a gift given to our intellects when God joins them directly to himself without any intermediary. And since in seeing this perfect vision of what (and who) God is, we grasp also his perfect goodness, this act of \"seeing\" is at the same time a perfect act of loving God as the highest and infinite goodness.\n\nAccording to Aquinas, the Beatific Vision surpasses both faith and reason. Rational knowledge does not fully satisfy humankind's innate desire to know God, since reason is primarily concerned with sensible objects and thus can only infer its conclusions about God indirectly. \"Summa Theologiae\"\n\nThe Theological virtue of faith, too, is incomplete, since Aquinas thinks that it always implies some imperfection in the understanding. The believer does not wish to remain merely on the level of faith but to grasp directly the object of faith, who is God himself. \"Summa Contra Gentiles\"\n\nThus only the fullness of the Beatific Vision satisfies this fundamental desire of the human soul to know God. Quoting St Paul, Aquinas notes \"We see now in a glass darkly, but then face to face\" (i Cor. 13:12). The Beatific Vision is the final reward for those saints elect by God to partake in and \"enjoy the same happiness wherewith God is happy, seeing Him in the way which He sees Himself\" in the next life. \"Summa Contra Gentiles\"\n\nPope John XXII (1316–1334) caused a controversy involving the Beatific Vision. He said not as Pope but as a private theologian that the saved do not attain the Beatific Vision until Judgment Day, a view more consistent with soul sleep. The general understanding at the time was that the saved attained Heaven after being purified and before Judgment Day. He never proclaimed his belief as doctrine but rather as an opinion (see \"ex cathedra\", as defined at the First Vatican Council in 1870).\n\nThe Sacred College of Cardinals held a consistory on the problem in January 1334, and Pope John backed away from his novel views to the more standard understanding.\n\nHis successor, Pope Benedict XII, declared it doctrine that the saved see Heaven (and thus, God) before Judgment Day.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the most important myths of the culture of Chile.\n\nAccording to Chilean legend, the \"Caleuche\" is a large ghost ship sailing the seas around Chiloé (a small island off the coast of Chile) at night. The \"Caleuche\" is said to be a being who is conscious and sentient. The ship appears as a beautiful and bright white sailing ship, with 3 masts of 5 sails each, always full of lights and with the sounds of a party on board, but quickly disappears again, leaving no evidence of its presence. The ghost ship is also known to be able to navigate under water, just like another well known ghost ship, the \"Flying Dutchman\".\n\nThere are various versions of the legend of the \"Caleuche\".\n\nOne version claims that it is crewed by the drowned, who are brought to the ship by three Chilote mythological figures, two sisters: the \"sirena chilota\" (a type of mermaid) and the Pincoya and their brother, the Pincoy. Once aboard, the dead can resume an existence as if they were alive again.\n\nA similar version of the legend is that the mythical ship appears in the sea of the Chiloé Archipelago where it captivates fishermen and sailors with its enchanting music to enslave them as part of their crew for eternity. These slaves are defined as eternally having a leg folded over their back, similar to the Imbunche of Chilote mythology.\n\nAnother common version is that it is the magic ship that the Warlocks of Chiloé use to have parties and transport their goods. It is also used by the warlocks every three months when they go on a journey to improve their magical abilities. The warlocks are only able to reach the ship by summoning \"caballo marino chilote\". This is because Millalobo (the king of the seas) has prohibited any other people from boarding the ship or getting to it by any other means.\n\nAnother version is that the crew of the \"Caleuche\" makes magical pacts with certain traders ensuring them prosperity in exchange for favors such as using their houses for parties or other illegal or dark purposes. Because of this version of the legend when a person in Chiloé gets rich quickly, it is often attributed to his having made a pact with the crew of the \"Caleuche\". Rumors like these were rampant following the 1960 Valdivia earthquake because some houses were untouched by the fires that swept through Chiloé afterwards. In that same decade there were stories that the sounds of a ship dropping anchor could be heard around the houses of many prosperous merchants in the Chiloé archipelago. These were supposedly the sounds of the \"Caleuche\" stealthily delivering goods and treasures to those with whom it had a pact. However, most people rejected this supernatural explanation and instead blamed the merchant's prosperity on mortal, rather than supernatural, smugglers.\n\nThe legend of the \"Caleuche\" is referred to in Alastair Reynolds' 2001 novel Chasm City, when the Chilean crewmembers of a generation ship discover a \"ghost ship\" trailing the flotilla of colony vessels and dub the ship \"Caleuche\".\n\nThe \"Caleuche\" is a living vessel which travels the world, carrying a crew of monster hunters in The Luke Coles Book Series by Josh Walker.\n\nIn film and television, Raúl Ruiz's \"Three Crowns of the Sailor\" (1983) and \"Litoral\" (2008) and Jorge Olguín's \"Caleuche: The Call of the Sea\" (2012) are all loosely inspired by the legend.\n\n\n"}

Since they allow to check the reliability of chosen mathematical models, computer simulations have become a useful tool for the mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics (computational physics), astrophysics, climatology, chemistry, biology and manufacturing, human systems in economics, psychology, social science, health care and engineering. Simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions.\n\nComputer simulations are realized by running computer programs that can be either small, running almost instantly on small devices, or large-scale programs that run for hours or days on network-based groups of computers. The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible (or perhaps even imaginable) using traditional paper-and-pencil mathematical modeling. Over 10 years ago, a desert-battle simulation of one force invading another involved the modeling of 66,239 tanks, trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around Kuwait, using multiple supercomputers in the DoD High Performance Computer Modernization Program.\nOther examples include a 1-billion-atom model of material deformation; a 2.64-million-atom model of the complex protein-producing organelle of all living organisms, the ribosome, in 2005;\na complete simulation of the life cycle of Mycoplasma genitalium in 2012; and the Blue Brain project at EPFL (Switzerland), begun in May 2005 to create the first computer simulation of the entire human brain, right down to the molecular level.\n\nBecause of the computational cost of simulation, computer experiments are used to perform inference such as uncertainty quantification.\n\nA computer model is the algorithms and equations used to capture the behavior of the system being modeled. By contrast, computer simulation is the actual running of the program that contains these equations or algorithms. Simulation, therefore, is the process of running a model. Thus one would not \"build a simulation\"; instead, one would \"build a model\", and then either \"run the model\" or equivalently \"run a simulation\".\n\nComputer simulation developed hand-in-hand with the rapid growth of the computer, following its first large-scale deployment during the Manhattan Project in World War II to model the process of nuclear detonation. It was a simulation of 12 hard spheres using a Monte Carlo algorithm. Computer simulation is often used as an adjunct to, or substitute for, modeling systems for which simple closed form analytic solutions are not possible. There are many types of computer simulations; their common feature is the attempt to generate a sample of representative scenarios for a model in which a complete enumeration of all possible states of the model would be prohibitive or impossible.\n\nThe external data requirements of simulations and models vary widely. For some, the input might be just a few numbers (for example, simulation of a waveform of AC electricity on a wire), while others might require terabytes of information (such as weather and climate models).\n\nInput sources also vary widely:\n\nLastly, the time at which data is available varies:\n\nBecause of this variety, and because diverse simulation systems have many common elements, there are a large number of specialized simulation languages. The best-known may be Simula (sometimes called Simula-67, after the year 1967 when it was proposed). There are now many others.\n\nSystems that accept data from external sources must be very careful in knowing what they are receiving. While it is easy for computers to read in values from text or binary files, what is much harder is knowing what the accuracy (compared to measurement resolution and precision) of the values are. Often they are expressed as \"error bars\", a minimum and maximum deviation from the value range within which the true value (is expected to) lie. Because digital computer mathematics is not perfect, rounding and truncation errors multiply this error, so it is useful to perform an \"error analysis\" to confirm that values output by the simulation will still be usefully accurate.\n\nEven small errors in the original data can accumulate into substantial error later in the simulation. While all computer analysis is subject to the \"GIGO\" (garbage in, garbage out) restriction, this is especially true of digital simulation. Indeed, observation of this inherent, cumulative error in digital systems was the main catalyst for the development of chaos theory.\n\nComputer models can be classified according to several independent pairs of attributes, including:\n\nAnother way of categorizing models is to look at the underlying data structures. For time-stepped simulations, there are two main classes:\n\nEquations define the relationships between elements of the modeled system and attempt to find a state in which the system is in equilibrium. Such models are often used in simulating physical systems, as a simpler modeling case before dynamic simulation is attempted.\n\nFormerly, the output data from a computer simulation was sometimes presented in a table or a matrix showing how data were affected by numerous changes in the simulation parameters. The use of the matrix format was related to traditional use of the matrix concept in mathematical models. However, psychologists and others noted that humans could quickly perceive trends by looking at graphs or even moving-images or motion-pictures generated from the data, as displayed by computer-generated-imagery (CGI) animation. Although observers could not necessarily read out numbers or quote math formulas, from observing a moving weather chart they might be able to predict events (and \"see that rain was headed their way\") much faster than by scanning tables of rain-cloud coordinates. Such intense graphical displays, which transcended the world of numbers and formulae, sometimes also led to output that lacked a coordinate grid or omitted timestamps, as if straying too far from numeric data displays. Today, weather forecasting models tend to balance the view of moving rain/snow clouds against a map that uses numeric coordinates and numeric timestamps of events.\n\nSimilarly, CGI computer simulations of CAT scans can simulate how a tumor might shrink or change during an extended period of medical treatment, presenting the passage of time as a spinning view of the visible human head, as the tumor changes.\n\nOther applications of CGI computer simulations are being developed to graphically display large amounts of data, in motion, as changes occur during a simulation run.\n\nGeneric examples of types of computer simulations in science, which are derived from an underlying mathematical description:\n\nSpecific examples of computer simulations follow:\n\nNotable, and sometimes controversial, computer simulations used in science include: Donella Meadows' World3 used in the \"Limits to Growth\", James Lovelock's Daisyworld and Thomas Ray's Tierra.\n\nIn social sciences, computer simulation is an integral component of the five angles of analysis fostered by the data percolation methodology, which also includes qualitative and quantitative methods, reviews of the literature (including scholarly), and interviews with experts, and which forms an extension of data triangulation.\n\nGraphical environments to design simulations have been developed. Special care was taken to handle events (situations in which the simulation equations are not valid and have to be changed). The open project Open Source Physics was started to develop reusable libraries for simulations in Java, together with Easy Java Simulations, a complete graphical environment that generates code based on these libraries.\n\nTaiwanese Tone Group Parser is a simulator of Taiwanese tone sandhi acquisition.\nIn practical, the method using linguistic theory to implement the Taiwanese tone group parser is a way to apply knowledge engineering technique to build the experiment environment of computer simulation for language acquisition. A work-in-process version of artificial tone group parser that includes a knowledge base and an executable program file for Microsoft Windows system (XP/Win7) can be download for evaluation.\n\nComputer simulations are used in a wide variety of practical contexts, such as:\n\nThe reliability and the trust people put in computer simulations depends on the validity of the simulation model, therefore verification and validation are of crucial importance in the development of computer simulations. Another important aspect of computer simulations is that of reproducibility of the results, meaning that a simulation model should not provide a different answer for each execution. Although this might seem obvious, this is a special point of attention in stochastic simulations, where random numbers should actually be semi-random numbers. An exception to reproducibility are human-in-the-loop simulations such as flight simulations and computer games. Here a human is part of the simulation and thus influences the outcome in a way that is hard, if not impossible, to reproduce exactly.\n\nVehicle manufacturers make use of computer simulation to test safety features in new designs. By building a copy of the car in a physics simulation environment, they can save the hundreds of thousands of dollars that would otherwise be required to build and test a unique prototype. Engineers can step through the simulation milliseconds at a time to determine the exact stresses being put upon each section of the prototype.\n\nComputer graphics can be used to display the results of a computer simulation. Animations can be used to experience a simulation in real-time, e.g., in training simulations. In some cases animations may also be useful in faster than real-time or even slower than real-time modes. For example, faster than real-time animations can be useful in visualizing the buildup of queues in the simulation of humans evacuating a building. Furthermore, simulation results are often aggregated into static images using various ways of scientific visualization.\n\nIn debugging, simulating a program execution under test (rather than executing natively) can detect far more errors than the hardware itself can detect and, at the same time, log useful debugging information such as instruction trace, memory alterations and instruction counts. This technique can also detect buffer overflow and similar \"hard to detect\" errors as well as produce performance information and tuning data.\n\nAlthough sometimes ignored in computer simulations, it is very important to perform a sensitivity analysis to ensure that the accuracy of the results is properly understood. For example, the probabilistic risk analysis of factors determining the success of an oilfield exploration program involves combining samples from a variety of statistical distributions using the Monte Carlo method. If, for instance, one of the key parameters (e.g., the net ratio of oil-bearing strata) is known to only one significant figure, then the result of the simulation might not be more precise than one significant figure, although it might (misleadingly) be presented as having four significant figures.\n\nThe following three steps should be used to produce accurate simulation models: calibration, verification, and validation. Computer simulations are good at portraying and comparing theoretical scenarios, but in order to accurately model actual case studies they have to match what is actually happening today. A base model should be created and calibrated so that it matches the area being studied. The calibrated model should then be verified to ensure that the model is operating as expected based on the inputs. Once the model has been verified, the final step is to validate the model by comparing the outputs to historical data from the study area. This can be done by using statistical techniques and ensuring an adequate R-squared value. Unless these techniques are employed, the simulation model created will produce inaccurate results and not be a useful prediction tool.\n\nModel calibration is achieved by adjusting any available parameters in order to adjust how the model operates and simulates the process. For example, in traffic simulation, typical parameters include look-ahead distance, car-following sensitivity, discharge headway, and start-up lost time. These parameters influence driver behavior such as when and how long it takes a driver to change lanes, how much distance a driver leaves between his car and the car in front of it, and how quickly a driver starts to accelerate through an intersection. Adjusting these parameters has a direct effect on the amount of traffic volume that can traverse through the modeled roadway network by making the drivers more or less aggressive. These are examples of calibration parameters that can be fine-tuned to match characteristics observed in the field at the study location. Most traffic models have typical default values but they may need to be adjusted to better match the driver behavior at the specific location being studied.\n\nModel verification is achieved by obtaining output data from the model and comparing them to what is expected from the input data. For example, in traffic simulation, traffic volume can be verified to ensure that actual volume throughput in the model is reasonably close to traffic volumes input into the model. Ten percent is a typical threshold used in traffic simulation to determine if output volumes are reasonably close to input volumes. Simulation models handle model inputs in different ways so traffic that enters the network, for example, may or may not reach its desired destination. Additionally, traffic that wants to enter the network may not be able to, if congestion exists. This is why model verification is a very important part of the modeling process.\n\nThe final step is to validate the model by comparing the results with what is expected based on historical data from the study area. Ideally, the model should produce similar results to what has happened historically. This is typically verified by nothing more than quoting the R-squared statistic from the fit. This statistic measures the fraction of variability that is accounted for by the model. A high R-squared value does not necessarily mean the model fits the data well. Another tool used to validate models is graphical residual analysis. If model output values drastically differ from historical values, it probably means there is an error in the model. Before using the model as a base to produce additional models, it is important to verify it for different scenarios to ensure that each one is accurate. If the outputs do not reasonably match historic values during the validation process, the model should be reviewed and updated to produce results more in line with expectations. It is an iterative process that helps to produce more realistic models.\n\nValidating traffic simulation models requires comparing traffic estimated by the model to observed traffic on the roadway and transit systems. Initial comparisons are for trip interchanges between quadrants, sectors, or other large areas of interest. The next step is to compare traffic estimated by the models to traffic counts, including transit ridership, crossing contrived barriers in the study area. These are typically called screenlines, cutlines, and cordon lines and may be imaginary or actual physical barriers. Cordon lines surround particular areas such as a city's central business district or other major activity centers. Transit ridership estimates are commonly validated by comparing them to actual patronage crossing cordon lines around the central business district.\n\nThree sources of error can cause weak correlation during calibration: input error, model error, and parameter error. In general, input error and parameter error can be adjusted easily by the user. Model error however is caused by the methodology used in the model and may not be as easy to fix. Simulation models are typically built using several different modeling theories that can produce conflicting results. Some models are more generalized while others are more detailed. If model error occurs as a result, in may be necessary to adjust the model methodology to make results more consistent.\n\nIn order to produce good models that can be used to produce realistic results, these are the necessary steps that need to be taken in order to ensure that simulation models are functioning properly. Simulation models can be used as a tool to verify engineering theories, but they are only valid if calibrated properly. Once satisfactory estimates of the parameters for all models have been obtained, the models must be checked to assure that they adequately perform the intended functions. The validation process establishes the credibility of the model by demonstrating its ability to replicate actual traffic patterns. The importance of model validation underscores the need for careful planning, thoroughness and accuracy of the input data collection program that has this purpose. Efforts should be made to ensure collected data is consistent with expected values. For example, in traffic analysis it is typical for a traffic engineer to perform a site visit to verify traffic counts and become familiar with traffic patterns in the area. The resulting models and forecasts will be no better than the data used for model estimation and validation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8221", "title": "Death", "text": "Death\n\nDeath is the cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. Phenomena which commonly bring about death include aging, predation, malnutrition, disease, suicide, homicide, starvation, dehydration, and accidents or major trauma resulting in terminal injury. In most cases, bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death.\n\nDeath – particularly the death of humans – has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion, due to the affection for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial bonds with the deceased. Other concerns include fear of death, necrophobia, anxiety, sorrow, grief, emotional pain, depression, sympathy, compassion, solitude, or saudade. Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife, and also hold the idea of reward or judgement and punishment for past sin.\n\nThe word death comes from Old English \"dēaþ\", which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic *\"dauþuz\" (reconstructed by etymological analysis). This comes from the Proto-Indo-European stem *\"dheu-\" meaning the \"process, act, condition of dying\".\n\nThe concept and symptoms of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death. When a person has died, it is also said they have \"passed away\", \"passed on\", \"expired\", or are \"gone\", among numerous other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms. Bereft of life, the dead person is then a \"corpse\", \"cadaver\", a \"body\", a \"set of remains\", and when all flesh has rotted away, a skeleton. The terms \"carrion\" and \"carcass\" can also be used, though these more often connote the remains of non-human animals. As a polite reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the participle form of \"decease\", as in \"the deceased\"; another noun form is \"decedent\". The ashes left after a cremation are sometimes referred to by the neologism \"cremains\", a portmanteau of \"cremation\" and \"remains\".\n\nSenescence refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities, but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily (Hayflick & Moody, 2003).\n\nAlmost all animals who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from biological aging, known in life sciences as \"senescence\". Some organisms experience negligible senescence, even exhibiting biological immortality. These include the jellyfish \"Turritopsis dohrnii\", the hydra, and the planarian. Unnatural causes of death include suicide and homicide. From all causes, roughly 150,000 people die around the world each day.<ref name=\"doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011\"></ref> Of these, two thirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence, but in industrialized countries – such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany – the rate approaches 90%, i.e., nearly nine out of ten of all deaths are related to senescence.\n\nPhysiological death is now seen as a process, more than an event: conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible. Where in the process a dividing line is drawn between life and death depends on factors beyond the presence or absence of vital signs. In general, clinical death is neither necessary nor sufficient for a determination of legal death. A patient with working heart and lungs determined to be brain dead can be pronounced legally dead without clinical death occurring. As scientific knowledge and medicine advance, formulating a precise medical definition of death becomes more difficult.\n\nSigns of death or strong indications that a warm-blooded animal is no longer alive are:\n\nThe concept of death is a key to human understanding of the phenomenon. There are many scientific approaches to the concept. For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.\n\nOne of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems. Such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life. This general problem applies to the particular challenge of defining death in the context of medicine.\n\nIt is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers. Additionally, many religious traditions, including Abrahamic and Dharmic traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness. In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.\n\nOther definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something. In this context \"death\" describes merely the state where something has ceased, for example, life. Thus, the definition of \"life\" simultaneously defines death.\n\nHistorically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been subjective, or imprecise. Death was once defined as the cessation of heartbeat (cardiac arrest) and of breathing, but the development of CPR and prompt defibrillation have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events which were causally linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of life support devices, organ transplants and artificial pacemakers.\n\nToday, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to \"brain death\" or \"biological death\" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of consciousness. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain sleep stages, and especially a coma. In the case of sleep, EEGs can easily tell the difference.\n\nThe category of \"brain death\" is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: \"By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant \"brain-dead\" women).\"\n\nThose people maintaining that only the neo-cortex of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of cognitive function, as evidenced by the death of the cerebral cortex. All hope of recovering human thought and personality is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death – irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex – has been adopted (for example the Uniform Determination Of Death Act in the United States). In 2005, the Terri Schiavo case brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of American politics.\n\nEven by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain drugs, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, or hypothermia can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.\n\nThe death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between different jurisdictions.\nA death certificate is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor, or by an administrative office upon presentation of a doctor's declaration of death.\n\nThere are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then \"coming back to life\", sometimes days later in their own coffin, or when embalming procedures are about to begin. From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J.C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.\n\nIn cases of electric shock, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned nerves to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. People found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an emergency room. In science fiction scenarios where such technology is readily available, real death is distinguished from reversible death.\n\nThe leading cause of human death in developing countries is infectious disease. The leading causes in developed countries are atherosclerosis (heart disease and stroke), cancer, and other diseases related to obesity and aging. By an extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging, leading to various complications known as aging-associated diseases. These conditions cause loss of homeostasis, leading to cardiac arrest, causing loss of oxygen and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the brain and other tissues. Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die of age-related causes. In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, approaching 90%. With improved medical capability, dying has become a condition to be managed. Home deaths, once commonplace, are now rare in the developed world.\nIn developing nations, inferior sanitary conditions and lack of access to modern medical technology makes death from infectious diseases more common than in developed countries. One such disease is tuberculosis, a bacterial disease which killed 1.8M people in 2015. Malaria causes about 400–900M cases of fever and 1–3M deaths annually. AIDS death toll in Africa may reach 90–100M by 2025.\n\nAccording to Jean Ziegler (United Nations Special Reporter on the Right to Food, 2000 – Mar 2008), mortality due to malnutrition accounted for 58% of the total mortality rate in 2006. Ziegler says worldwide approximately 62M people died from all causes and of those deaths more than 36M died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in micronutrients.\n\nTobacco smoking killed 100 million people worldwide in the 20th century and could kill 1 billion people around the world in the 21st century, a World Health Organization report warned.\n\nMany leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by diet and physical activity, but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human longevity. The evolutionary cause of aging is, at best, only just beginning to be understood. It has been suggested that direct intervention in the aging process may now be the most effective intervention against major causes of death.\n\nSelye proposed a unified non-specific approach to many causes of death. He demonstrated that stress decreases adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe the adaptability as a special resource, \"adaptation energy\". The animal dies when this resource is exhausted. Selye assumed that the adaptability is a finite supply, presented at birth. Later on, Goldstone proposed the concept of a production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored (up to a limit), as a capital reserve of adaptation. In recent works, adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the \"dominant path\" in the model of adaptation. It is demonstrated that oscillations of well-being appear when the reserve of adaptability is almost exhausted.\n\nIn 2012, suicide overtook car crashes for leading causes of human injury deaths in the U.S., followed by poisoning, falls and murder. Causes of death are different in different parts of the world. In high-income and middle income countries nearly half up to more than two thirds of all people live beyond the age of 70 and predominantly die of chronic diseases. In low-income countries, where less than one in five of all people reach the age of 70, and more than a third of all deaths are among children under 15, people predominantly die of infectious diseases.\n\nAn autopsy, also known as a \"postmortem examination\" or an \"obduction\", is a medical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a human corpse to determine the cause and manner of a person's death and to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present. It is usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a pathologist.\n\nAutopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from next of kin may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.\n\nA \"necropsy\" is an older term for a postmortem examination, unregulated, and not always a medical procedure. In modern times the term is more often used in the postmortem examination of the corpses of animals.\n\nCryonics (from Greek κρύος 'kryos-' meaning 'icy cold') is the low-temperature preservation of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and resuscitation may be possible in the future.\n\nCryopreservation of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology. The stated rationale for cryonics is that people who are considered dead by current legal or medical definitions may not necessarily be dead according to the more stringent information-theoretic definition of death. It is proposed that cryopreserved people might someday be recovered by using highly advanced technology.\n\nSome scientific literature supports the feasibility of cryonics. Many other scientists regard cryonics with skepticism. By 2015, more than 300 people have undergone cryopreservation procedures since cryonics was first proposed in 1962.\n\nLife extension refers to an increase in maximum or average lifespan, especially in humans, by slowing down or reversing the processes of aging. Average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to accidents and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as cancer, or cardiovascular disease. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good diet, exercise and avoidance of hazards such as smoking. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is calorie restriction. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by periodic replacement of damaged tissues, or by molecular repair or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissues.\n\nA United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people. 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.\n\nResearchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as \"biomedical gerontologists\". They try to understand the nature of aging and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or to at least slow them down, for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life. Those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called \"life extensionists\" or \"longevists\". The primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available anti-aging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure to aging once it is developed.\n\n\"One of medicine's new frontiers: treating the dead\", recognizes that cells that have been without oxygen for more than five minutes die, not from lack of oxygen, but rather when their oxygen supply is resumed. Therefore, practitioners of this approach, e.g., at the Resuscitation Science institute at the University of Pennsylvania, \"aim to reduce oxygen uptake, slow metabolism and adjust the blood chemistry for gradual and safe reperfusion.\"\n\nBefore about 1930, most people in Western countries died in their own homes, surrounded by family, and comforted by clergy, neighbors, and doctors making house calls. By the mid-20th century, half of all Americans died in a hospital. By the start of the 21st century, only about 20 to 25% of people in developed countries died outside a medical institution. The shift away from dying at home, towards dying in a professionalized medical environment, has been termed the \"Invisible Death\". The \"Invisible Death\" process was extremely slow and infinitesimal. It took many years to shift to this new location where dying was commonly taking place outside the home.\n\nIn society, the nature of death and humanity's awareness of its own mortality has for millennia been a concern of the world's religious traditions and of philosophical inquiry. This includes belief in resurrection or an afterlife (associated with Abrahamic religions), reincarnation or rebirth (associated with Dharmic religions), or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist, known as eternal oblivion (associated with atheism).\n\nCommemoration ceremonies after death may include various mourning, funeral practices and ceremonies of honouring the deceased. The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a \"corpse\" or \"body\", are usually interred whole or cremated, though among the world's cultures there are a variety of other methods of mortuary disposal. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include \"rest in peace\", or its initialism RIP.\n\nDeath is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the afterlife and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The disposal of human corpses does, in general, begin with the last offices before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or cremation. This is not a unified practice; in Tibet, for instance, the body is given a sky burial and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one's spiritual attainments into another body (reincarnation) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet. Mummification or embalming is also prevalent in some cultures, to retard the rate of decay.\n\nLegal aspects of death are also part of many cultures, particularly the settlement of the deceased estate and the issues of inheritance and in some countries, inheritance taxation.\nCapital punishment is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated murder, espionage, treason, or as part of military justice. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as adultery and sodomy, carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as apostasy, the formal renunciation of one's religion. In many retentionist countries, drug trafficking is also a capital offense. In China, human trafficking and serious cases of corruption are also punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world courts-martial have imposed death sentences for offenses such as cowardice, desertion, insubordination, and mutiny.\n\nDeath in warfare and in suicide attack also have cultural links, and the ideas of dulce et decorum est pro patria mori, mutiny punishable by death, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and death notification are embedded in many cultures. Recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the September 11 attacks, but also further back in time with suicide bombings, kamikaze missions in World War II and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and martyrdom have had significant cultural impacts.\n\nSuicide in general, and particularly euthanasia, are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In Japan, for example, ending a life with honor by seppuku was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin. Death is personified in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the Grim Reaper, Azrael, the Hindu God Yama and Father Time.\n\nIn Brazil, a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório, a government-authorized registry. Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório. Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate mortality rates.\n\nTalking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like India) may be more open to accepting it as a \"fait accompli\", with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burning-to-ashes of the same.\n\nMuch interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one's consciousness as one's body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called \"eternal oblivion\". Belief that the stream of consciousness is preserved after physical death is described by the term \"afterlife\".\n\nAfter death the remains of an organism become part of the biogeochemical cycle. Animals may be consumed by a predator or a scavenger. Organic material may then be further decomposed by detritivores, organisms which recycle detritus, returning it to the environment for reuse in the food chain, where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism. Examples of detritivores include earthworms, woodlice and dung beetles.\n\nMicroorganisms also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be decomposed fully. Coal, a fossil fuel formed over vast tracts of time in swamp ecosystems, is one example.\n\nContemporary evolutionary theory sees death as an important part of the process of natural selection. It is considered that organisms less adapted to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the gene pool. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to extinction and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as speciation. Frequency of reproduction plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to Darwinian criteria, much greater fitness than a long-lived organism leaving only one.\n\nExtinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of taxa, reducing biodiversity. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential range may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as Lazarus taxa, where species presumed extinct abruptly \"reappear\" (typically in the fossil record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of speciation, an aspect of evolution. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an ecological niche – and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.\n\nInquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include \"Hydra\" and the already cited jellyfish \"Turritopsis dohrnii\", which research shows to be biologically immortal). The evolutionary origin of senescence remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. Gerontology specializes in the science of human aging processes.\n\nOrganisms showing only asexual reproduction (e.g. bacteria, some protists, like the euglenoids and many amoebozoans) and unicellular organisms with sexual reproduction (colonial or not, like the volvocine algae \"Pandorina\" and \"Chlamydomonas\") are \"immortal\" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident. In multicellular organisms (and also in multinucleate ciliates), with a Weismannist development, that is, with a division of labor between mortal somatic (body) cells and \"immortal\" germ (reproductive) cells, death becomes an essential part of life, at least for the somatic line.\n\nThe \"Volvox\" algae are among the simplest organisms to exhibit that division of labor between two completely different cell types, and as a consequence include death of somatic line as a regular, genetically regulated part of its life history.\n\nDeath is an important subject of religious doctrine.\n\nIn Buddhist doctrine and practice, death plays an important role. Awareness of death was what motivated Prince Siddhartha to strive to find the \"deathless\" and finally to attain enlightenment. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of having been born as a human being. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain enlightenment, therefore death helps remind oneself that one should not that for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove death anxiety, since all existence in the cycle of rebirth is considered filled with suffering, and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.\n\nDeath is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the Four Noble Truths and dependent origination.\n\nDeath is seen in Judaism as tragic and intimidating. Persons who come into contact with corpses are ritually impure. There are a variety of beliefs about the afterlife within Judaism, but none of them contradict the preference of life over death. This is partially because death puts a cessation to the possibility of fulfilling any commandments.\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "234393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=234393", "title": "Dignity", "text": "Dignity\n\nDignity is the right of a person to be valued and respected for their own sake, and to be treated ethically. It is of significance in morality, ethics, law and politics as an extension of the Enlightenment-era concepts of inherent, inalienable rights. The term may also be used to describe personal conduct, as in \"behaving with dignity\".\n\nThe English word \"dignity\", attested from the early 13th century, comes from Latin \"dignitas\" (worthiness)\nby way of French \"dignité\".\n\nEnglish-speakers often use the word \"dignity\" in proscriptive and cautionary ways: for example, in politics it can be used to critique the treatment of oppressed and vulnerable groups and peoples, but it has also been applied to cultures and sub-cultures, to religious beliefs and ideals, and even to animals used for food or research.\n\n\"Dignity\" also has descriptive meanings pertaining to the \"worth\" of human beings. In general, the term has various functions and meanings depending on how the term is used and on the context.\n\nIn ordinary modern usage, the word denotes \"respect\" and \"status\", and it is often used to suggest that someone is not receiving a proper degree of respect, or even that they are failing to treat themselves with proper self-respect. There is also a long history of special philosophical use of this term. However, it is rarely defined outright in political, legal, and scientific discussions. International proclamations have thus far left dignity undefined,\nand scientific commentators, such as those arguing against genetic research and algeny, cite dignity as a reason but are ambiguous about its application.\n\nHuman dignity can be violated in multiple ways. The main categories of violations are:\nViolations of human dignity in terms of humiliation refer to acts that humiliate or diminish the self-worth of a person or a group. Acts of humiliation are context dependent but we normally have an intuitive understanding where such a violation occurs. As Schachter noted, “it has been generally assumed that a violation of human dignity can be recognized even if the abstract term cannot be defined. ‘I know it when I see it even if I cannot tell you what it is’”. More generally, etymology of the word “humiliation” has a universal characteristic in the sense that in all languages the word involves “downward spatial orientation” in which “something or someone is pushed down and forcefully held there”. This approach is common in judicial decisions where judges refer to violations of human dignity as injuries to people's self-worth or their self-esteem.\nThis aspect refers to treating a person as an instrument or as means to achieve some other goal. This approach builds on Immanuel Kant's moral imperative stipulating that we should treat people as ends or goals in themselves, namely as having ultimate moral worth which should not be instrumentalized. \nViolations of human dignity as degradation refer to acts that degrade the value of human beings. These are acts that, even if done by consent, convey a message that diminishes the importance or value of all human beings. They consist of practices that human beings should not be subjected to, regardless of whether subjective humiliation is involved, such as selling oneself to slavery, or when a state authority deliberately puts prisoners in inhuman living conditions. \nThese are acts that strip a person or a group of their human characteristics. It may involve describing or treating them as animals or as a lower type of human beings. This has occurred in genocides such as the Holocaust and in Rwanda where the minority were compared to insects.\n\nSome of the practices that violate human dignity include torture, rape, social exclusion, labor exploitation, bonded labor, and slavery. \n\nBoth absolute and relative poverty are violations of human dignity, although they also have other significant dimensions, such as social injustice. Absolute poverty is associated with overt exploitation and connected to humiliation (for example, being forced to eat food from other people's garbage), but being dependent upon others to stay alive is a violation of dignity even in the absence of more direct violations. Relative poverty, on the other hand, is a violation because the cumulative experience of not being able to afford the same clothes, entertainment, social events, education, or other features of typical life in that society results in subtle humiliation; social rejection; marginalization; and consequently, a diminished self-respect.\n\nAnother example of violation of human dignity, especially for women in developing countries, is lack of sanitation. Having no access to toilets leaves currently about 1 billion people of the world with no choice other than to defecation in the open, which has been declared by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations as an affront to personal dignity. Human dignity is also violated by the practice of employing people in India for \"manual scavenging\" of human excreta from unsanitary toiletsusually by people of a lower caste, and more often by women than men.\n\nA further example of violation of human dignity, affecting women mainly in developing countries, is female genital mutilation (FGM).\n\nThe movie \"The Magic Christian\" depicts a wealthy man (Peter Sellers) and his son (Ringo Starr) who test the limits of dignity by forcing people to perform self-degrading acts for money. The \"Simpsons\" episode \"Homer vs. Dignity\" has a similar plot.\n\nA philosopher of the Renaissance, Pico della Mirandola, granted dignity to ideas and to beings. In his \"Oration on the Dignity of Man\", he told hostile clerics about the dignity of the liberal arts and about the dignity and the glory of angels. His comments implied the dignity of philosophers. This oration is commonly seen as one of the central texts of the Renaissance, intimately tied with the growth of humanist philosophies.\n\nA philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment (18th century), Immanuel Kant held that there were things that should not be discussed in terms of value, and that these things could be said to have dignity. 'Value' is necessarily relative, because the value of something depends on a particular observer's judgment of that thing. Things that are \"not\" relativethat are \"ends in themselves\", in Kant's terminologyare by extension beyond all value, and a thing is an \"end in itself\" only if it has a moral dimension; if it represents a choice between right and wrong. In Kant's words: \"Morality, and humanity as capable of it, is that which alone has dignity.\" Specifically with respect to human dignity, which his writings brought from relative obscurity in Western philosophy into a focal point for philosophers, Kant held that \"free will\" is essential; human dignity is related to human agency, the ability of humans to choose their own actions.\n\nPhilosophers of the late 20th century who have written significant works on the subject of dignity include Mortimer Adler and Alan Gewirth. Gewirth's views on human dignity are typically compared and contrasted with Kant's, for like Kant he theorizes that human dignity arises from agency. But while sharing Kant's view that rights arise from dignity, Gewirth focused far more than Kant on the positive obligations that dignity imposed on humans, the moral requirement not only to avoid harming but to actively assist one another in achieving and maintaining a state of \"well being\".\n\nAmong other topics, including the dignity of labor, Adler extensively explored the question of human equality and equal right to dignity. According to Adler, the question of whether humans have equal right to dignity is intrinsically bound in the question of whether human beings are truly equal, which itself is bound in the question of whether human beings are a distinct class from all things, including animals, or vary from other things only by degree. Adler wrote that the only sense in which it is true that all human beings are equal is that they are equally distinct from animals. \"The dignity of man,\" he said, \"is the dignity of the human being as a person—a dignity that is not possessed by things.\" To Adler, failure to recognize the distinction challenged the right of humans to equal dignity and equal treatment.\n\nDan Egonsson, followed by Roger Wertheimer, argued that while it is conventional for people to equate dignity with 'being human' (Egonsson's 'Standard Attitude', Wertheimer's 'Standard Belief'), people generally also import something other than mere humanness to their idea of dignity. Egonsson suggested that an entity must be both human and \"alive\" to merit an ascription of dignity, while Wertheimer states \"it is not a definitional truth that human beings have human status.\"\n\nAccording to Arthur Schopenhauer, dignity is opinion of others about our worth and subjective definition of dignity is our fear from this opinion of others.\n\nMore recently, Philippe-André Rodriguez has argued that human dignity is best understood as an essentially contested concept. As he argues, \"it seems that it is this very nature of the concept that has allowed, on the one hand, human rights to receive such international acceptance as a theoretical enterprise and, on the other hand, has led the concept to be constantly challenged by different cultures worldwide.\"\n\nHuman dignity is a central consideration of Christian philosophy The Catechism of the Catholic Church insists the \"dignity of the human person is rooted in his or her creation in the image and likeness of God.\" \"All human beings,\" says the Church, \"in as much as they are created in the image of God, have the dignity of a person.\" The catechism says, \"The right to the exercise of freedom belongs to everyone because it is inseparable from his or her dignity as a human person.\" The Catholic Church's view of human dignity is like Kant's insofar as it springs from human agency and free will, with the further understanding that free will in turn springs from human creation in the image of God.\n\nHuman dignity, or \"kevod ha-beriyot\", is also a central consideration of Judaism. \"Talmud\" cautions against giving charity publicly rather than in private to avoid offending the dignity of the recipient. Medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides in his codification of \"Halakha\" cautioned judges to preserve the self-respect of people who came before them: \"Let not human dignity be light in his eyes; for the respect due to man supersedes a negative rabbinical command\".\n\nAn Islamic view of dignity is crystallized in the Quran through the selected biographies of Noah, Abraham, Joseph, David, Moses, Mary, Jesus and others (differing from the narratives in the Bible, which the Quran claims were corrupted). Individuals such as these are presented as role-models of dignity because they did not abandon their self-respect by bowing to social pressures. When faced with the fear of disapproval, poverty, hunger, death etc. these individuals held firm in their sense of right and wrong, which was in-line with Divine ordinances. \"The right course is that on which one keeps his attitudes, ambitions and requirements subjected to the Divine Laws; and in this way leads a balanced and graceful life. Such a person has grasped the most trustworthy support which will never fail him\" (Quran 31:22) Such individuals are given the title of Muhsineen, who faced immense pressures but held firm in their positive actions. God awarded these individuals with authority and status in the land, and this reward is open to anyone who proves themselves worthy: \"We bestow such honour and position on all those who lead their lives according to Our Laws.\" (Quran 37:80) Those who fall into this category are also afforded Divine protection from their mistakes: \"Therefore We have saved you and your son from this. We have done so because We keep those who lead their lives according to Divine guidance safe from such mishaps.\" (37:104-105) The Quranic State that Muhammad began in Medinah sought to protect human dignity, since in a Quranic Welfare State individuals are free to work and live without the pressures faced by the threat of poverty, and thus can obey God's Laws as free individuals, contributing as part of a unified brotherhood working towards achieving humanity's full potential. Elaborations on dignity have been made by many scholars of Islam, such as Mohammad-Ali Taskhiri, head of the Islamic Culture and Communications Organization in Iran, in 1994. According to Taskhiri, dignity is a state to which all humans have equal \"potential\", but which can only be actualized by living a life pleasing to the eyes of God. This is in keeping with the 1990 Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, which states that \"True faith is the guarantee for enhancing such [basic human] dignity along the path to human perfection\".\n\nHuman dignity is considered as Buddhahood in Mahayana Buddhism in which it is rooted in the idea that we are able to choose the path of self-perfection as a human being.\n\nIn the 20th century, dignity became an issue for physicians and medical researchers. It has been invoked in questions of the bioethics of human genetic engineering, human cloning, and end-of-life care (particularly in such situations as the Terri Schiavo case, a controversial situation in which life support was withdrawn from a woman diagnosed in a persistent vegetative state).\n\nIn June 1964, the World Medical Association issued the \"Declaration of Helsinki\". The Declaration says at article 11, \"It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects.\"\n\nThe Council of Europe invoked dignity in its effort to govern the progress of biology and medicine. On 4 April 1997, the Council, at Oviedo, approved the \"Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine\". The convention's preamble contains these statements, among others:\n\nThe Convention states, \"Parties to this Convention shall protect the dignity and identity of all human beings and guarantee everyone, without discrimination, respect for their integrity and other rights and fundamental freedoms with regard to the application of biology and medicine.\"\n\nIn 1998, the United Nations mentioned dignity in the \"UNESCO Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights\". At Article 2, the declaration states, \"Everyone has a right to respect for their dignity.\" At Article 24, the declaration warns that treating a person to remove a genetic defect \"could be contrary to human dignity.\" The \"Commentary\" that accompanies the declaration says that, as a consequence of the possibility of germ-line treatment, \"it is the very dignity of the human race which is at stake.\"\n\nIn 1996, the Government of Canada issued a report entitled \"New Reproductive and Genetic Technologies\". The report used \"the principles of respect for human life and dignity\" as its reason for recommending that various activities associated with genetic research and human reproduction be prohibited. The report said the prohibited activities were \"contrary to Canadian values of equality and respect for human life and dignity.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Health enacted the \"Danish Council Act 1988\", which established the Danish Council of Ethics. The Council advises the Ministry on matters of medicine and genetic research on humans. In 2001, the Council condemned \"reproductive cloning because it would violate human dignity, because it could have adverse consequences for the cloned person and because permitting research on reproductive cloning would reflect a disregard for the respect due to the moral status of embryos.\"\n\nIn 1984, France set up the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences (CCNE) to advise the government about the regulation of medical practices and research. In 1986, the CCNE said, \"Respect for human dignity must guide both the development of knowledge and the limits or\nrules to be observed by research.\" The CCNE said that research on human embryos must be subject to \"the rule of reason\" and must have regard for \"undefined dignity in its practical consequences.\" The CCNE insisted that, in research on human embryos, the ethical principles that should apply are \"respecting human dignity\" and respecting \"the dignity of science.\"\n\nThe National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its \"Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning\" in 1997. The opinion states, \"the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited.\"\n\nSweden's \"The Genetic Integrity Act\" (2006:351), \"The Biobanks in Medical Care Act\" (2002:297), \"Health and Medical Services (Professional Activities) Act\" (1998:531), and \"The Health and Medical Services Act\" (1982:763) all express concern for \"the integrity of the individual\" or \"human dignity.\"\n\nIn 2008, The President's Council on Bioethics tried to arrive at a consensus about what dignity meant but failed. Edmund D. Pellegrino, M.D., the Council's Chairman, says in the Letter of Transmittal to the President of The United States, \"… there is no universal agreement on the meaning of the term, human dignity.\"\n\nMcDougal, Lasswell, and Chen studied dignity as a basis for international law. They said that using dignity as the basis for laws was a \"natural law approach.\" The natural law approach, they said, depends upon \"exercises of faith.\" McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen observed:\nIn 2004, Canada enacted the \"Assisted Human Reproduction Act\". Section 2(b) of the Act states, \"the benefits of assisted human reproductive technologies and related research for individuals, for families and for society in general can be most effectively secured by taking appropriate measures for the protection and promotion of human health, safety, dignity and rights in the use of these technologies and in related research.\" The Act prescribes a fine not exceeding $500,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or both, if someone undertakes a proscribed activity such as the creation of a chimera.\n\nArticle 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union affirms the inviolability of human dignity.\n\nIn 1997, the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences, as well as other observers, noted that France's dignity-based laws on bio-medical research were paradoxical. The law prohibited the willful destruction of human embryos but directed that human embryos could be destroyed if they were more than five years old. The law prohibited research on human embryos created in France but permitted research on human embryos brought to France. The law prohibited researchers from creating embryos for research but allowed researchers to experiment with embryos that were superfluous after \"in vitro\" fertilization.\n\nHuman dignity is the fundamental principle of the German constitution. Article 1, paragraph 1 reads: \"\"Human dignity is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority.\" \"Human dignity is thus mentioned even before the right to life. This has a significant impact on German law-making and jurisdiction in both serious and trivial items:\n\n\nThe need to respect human dignity has been written in the Iranian constitution law. Article 2 of the Iranian Constitution Law mentions six principles and infrastructures as basic to the governing system which in Article 1 is called the Islamic Republic of Iran. The sixth principle of this Article concerns human dignity and stipulates that “the Islamic Republic of Iran is a system founded on faith in ….6) Human dignity and high value and his/her freedom as well as his responsibility before God”[3]. Besides, in the prelude to the Constitution, human dignity is referred to concerning the mass media.\n\nThe Constitution of South Africa lists \"human dignity, the achievement of equality and the advancement of human rights and freedoms\" as one of the founding values of the South African state, and the Bill of Rights is described as affirming the \"democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom\". Section 10 of the Constitution explicitly states that \"Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected.\" In jurisprudence, the right to dignity is often seen as underlying more specific rights, such as equality, security of the person or privacy, but it has been directly applied in a number of cases relating to criminal punishment, the law of defamation, and the right to marriage and family life.\n\nThe Swiss Federal Constitution provides in article 7 that \"Human dignity must be respected and protected.\" It also provides, in art. 120, that the state must \"take account of the dignity of living beings as well as the safety of human beings, animals and the environment\" when legislating on the use of reproductive and genetic material; consequently the Federal Ethics Commission on Non-Human Biotechnology (ECNH) issued, in 2008, a publication entitled \"The dignity of living beings with regard to plants\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "446782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=446782", "title": "Emerging church", "text": "Emerging church\n\nThe emerging church is a Christian movement of the late 20th and early 21st centuries that crosses a number of theological boundaries: participants are variously described as Protestant, post-Protestant, evangelical, post-evangelical, liberal, post-liberal, conservative, post-conservative, anabaptist, reformed, charismatic, neocharismatic, and post-charismatic. Emerging churches can be found throughout the globe, predominantly in North America, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa. while others worship in traditional Christian denominations.\n\nProponents believe the movement transcends the \"modernist\" labels of \"conservative\" and \"liberal,\" calling the movement a \"conversation\" to emphasize its developing and decentralized nature, its vast range of standpoints, and its commitment to dialogue. Participants seek to live their faith in what they believe to be a \"postmodern\" society. What those involved in the conversation mostly agree on is their disillusionment with the organized and institutional church and their support for the deconstruction of modern Christian worship, modern evangelism, and the nature of modern Christian community.\n\nEmerging churches are fluid, hard to define, and varied; they contrast themselves with what has gone before in referring to the latter as the \"inherited church.\" Key themes of the emerging church are couched in the language of reform, praxis-oriented lifestyles, post-evangelical thought, and incorporation or acknowledgment of political and postmodern elements.\nTerminological confusion has occurred because of the use of words with similar etymology. When used as descriptors, \"emerging\" and \"emergent\" can be interchangeable. However, when used as names, they are different. In this case \"Emerging\" refers to the whole informal, church-based, global movement, whilst \"Emergent\" to a formal, organisational subset associated with Tony Jones, Brian McLaren, Doug Pagitt, and others: the \"Emergent stream.\"\n\nMark Driscoll and Ed Stetzer described three categories within the movement: \"Relevants\", \"Reconstructionists\", and \"Revisionists.\"\n\n\"Relevants\" are theological conservatives who are interested in updating to current culture. They look to people like Dan Kimball and Donald Miller.\n\n\"Reconstructionists\" are generally theologically evangelical, and speak of new forms of church that result in transformed lives. They look to Neil Cole, Michael Frost and Alan Hirsch.\n\n\"Revisionists\" are theologically liberal, and openly question whether evangelical doctrine is appropriate for the postmodern world. They look to leaders such as Brian McLaren, Rob Bell and Doug Pagitt.\n\nDriscoll has subsequently identified a fourth stream, the house church movement, which he previously included under the Reconstructionist label. Driscoll and Scot McKnight have now voiced concerns over Brian McLaren and the \"emergent thread.\" Some evangelical leaders such as Shane Claiborne have also sought to distance themselves from the emerging church movement, its labels and the \"emergent brand.\"\n\nAccording to Mobsby the term \"emerging church\" was first used in 1970, when Larson and Osborne predicted a movement characterised by: contextual and experimental mission; new forms of church; the removal of barriers and division; a blend of evangelism and social action; attention to both experience and tradition; the breakdown of clergy/laity distinctions. The Catholic political theologian, Johann Baptist Metz, used the term \"emergent church\" in 1981 in a different context. Marcus Borg says: \"The emerging paradigm has been visible for well over a hundred years. In the last twenty to thirty years, it has become a major grassroots movement among both laity and clergy in 'mainline' or 'old mainline' Protestant denominations.\" He describes it as: \"a way of seeing the Bible (and the Christian tradition as a whole) as \"historical\", \"metaphorical\", and \"sacramental\", [and] a way of seeing the Christian life as \"relational\" and \"transformational\".\"\n\nThe history of the emerging church that preceded the US Emergent organization began with Mike Riddell and Mark Pierson in New Zealand from 1989, and with a number of practitioners in the UK including Jonny Baker, Ian Mobsby, Kevin, Ana and Brian Draper, and Sue Wallace amongst others, from around 1992. The influence of the Nine O'Clock Service has been ignored also, owing to its notoriety, yet much that was practised there was influential on early proponents of alternative worship.\n\nCommon to the identity of many of these emerging-church projects that began in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, is their development with very little central planning on behalf of the established denominations. They occurred as the initiative of particular groups wanting to start new contextual church experiments, and are therefore very \"bottom up.\" Murray says that these churches began in a spontaneous way, with informal relationships formed between otherwise independent groups and that many became churches as a development from their initial more modest beginnings.\n\nGibbs and Bolger interviewed a number of people involved in leading emerging churches and from this research have identified some core values in the emerging church, including desires to imitate the life of Jesus; transform secular society; emphasise communal living; welcome outsiders; be generous and creative; and lead without control. Ian Mobsby suggests Trinitarian Ecclesiology is the basis of these shared international values.\n\nMobsby also suggests that the Emerging Church is centred on a combination of models of Church and of Contextual Theology that draw on this Trinitarian base: the Mystical Communion and Sacramental models of Church, and the Synthetic and Transcendent models of Contextual Theology.\n\nAccording to Mobsby, the Emerging Church has reacted to the missional needs of postmodern culture and re-acquired a Trinitarian basis to its understanding of Church as Worship, Mission and Community. He argues this movement is over and against some forms of conservative evangelicalism and other reformed ecclesiologies since the enlightenment that have neglected the Trinity, which has caused problems with certainty, judgementalism and fundamentalism and the increasing gap between the Church and contemporary culture.\n\nMembers of the movement often place a high value on good works or social activism, including missional living. According to Stuart Murray, Christendom is the creation and maintenance of a Christian nation by ensuring a close relationship of power between the Christian Church and its host culture. Today, churches may still attempt to use this power in mission and evangelism. The emerging church considers this to be unhelpful. Murray summarizes Christendom values as: a commitment to hierarchy and the status quo; the loss of lay involvement; institutional values rather than community focus; church at the centre of society rather than the margins; the use of political power to bring in the Kingdom; religious compulsion; punitive rather than restorative justice; marginalisation of women, the poor, and dissident movements; inattentiveness to the criticisms of those outraged by the historic association of Christianity with patriarchy, warfare, injustice and patronage; partiality for respectability and top-down mission; attractional evangelism; assuming the Christian story is known; and a preoccupation with the rich and powerful.\n\nThe emerging church seeks a post-Christendom approach to being church and mission through: renouncing imperialistic approaches to language and cultural imposition; making 'truth claims' with humility and respect; overcoming the public/private dichotomy; moving church from the center to the margins; moving from a place of privilege in society to one voice amongst many; a transition from control to witness, maintenance to mission and institution to movement. \n\nIn the face of criticism, some in the emerging church respond that it is important to attempt a \"both and\" approach to redemptive and incarnational theologies. Some Evangelicals and Fundamentalists are perceived as \"overly redemptive\" and therefore in danger of condemning people by communicating the Good News in aggressive and angry ways. A more loving and affirming approach is proposed in the context of post-modernity where distrust may occur in response to power claims. It is suggested that this can form the basis of a constructive engagement with 21st-century post-industrial western cultures. According to Ian Mobsby, the suggestion that the emerging church is mainly focused on deconstruction and the rejection of current forms of church should itself be rejected.\n\nThe emerging church is a response to the perceived influence of modernism in Western Christianity. As some sociologists commented on a cultural shift that they believed to correspond to postmodern ways of perceiving reality in the late 20th century, some Christians began to advocate changes within the church in response. These Christians saw the contemporary church as being culturally bound to modernism. They changed their practices to relate to the new cultural situation. Emerging Christians began to challenge the modern church on issues such as: institutional structures, systematic theology, propositional teaching methods, a perceived preoccupation with buildings, an attractional understanding of mission, professional clergy, and a perceived preoccupation with the political process and unhelpful jargon (\"Christian-ese\").\n\nAs a result, some in the emerging church believe it is necessary to deconstruct modern Christian dogma. One way this happens is by engaging in dialogue, rather than proclaiming a predigested message, believing that this leads people to Jesus through the Holy Spirit on their own terms. Many in the movement embrace the missiology that drives the movement in an effort to be like Christ and make disciples by being a good example. The emerging church movement contains a great diversity in beliefs and practices, although some have adopted a preoccupation with sacred rituals, good works, and political and social activism. Much of the Emerging Church movement has also adopted the approach to evangelism which stressed peer-to-peer dialogue rather than dogmatic proclamation and proselytizing.\n\nA plurality of Scriptural interpretations is acknowledged in the emerging church movement. Participants in the movement exhibit a particular concern for the effect of the modern \"reader's\" cultural context on the act of interpretation echoing the ideas of postmodern thinkers such as Jacques Derrida and Stanley Fish. Therefore a narrative approach to Scripture, and history are emphasized in some emerging churches over exegetical and dogmatic approaches (such as that found in systematic theology and systematic exegesis), which are often viewed as reductionist. Others embrace a multiplicity of approaches.\n\nSpearheaded by Brian McLaren, some emerging church leaders see interfaith dialogue as a means to share their narratives as they learn from the narratives of others. Some Emerging Church Christians believe there are radically diverse perspectives within Christianity that are valuable for humanity to progress toward truth and a better resulting relationship with God, and that these different perspectives deserve Christian charity rather than condemnation. Reformed and evangelical opponents, like John MacArthur, do not believe that such generosity is appropriate, citing the movement's shift away from traditional evangelical beliefs such as eternal punishment and penal substitution towards a reintroduction of, for example, elements of ancient mysticism.\n\nMovement leaders such as Rob Bell appropriate set theory as a means of understanding a basic change in the way the Christian church thinks about itself as a group. \"Set theory\" is a concept in mathematics that allows an understanding of what numbers belong to a group, or set. A bounded set would describe a group with clear \"in\" and \"out\" definitions of membership. The Christian church has largely organized itself as a bounded set, those who share the same beliefs and values are in the set and those who disagree are outside.\n\nThe centered set does not limit membership to pre-conceived boundaries. Instead a centered set is conditioned on a centered point. Membership is contingent on those who are moving toward that point. Elements moving toward a particular point are part of the set, but elements moving away from that point are not. As a centered-set Christian membership would be dependent on moving toward the central point of Jesus. Christians are then defined by their focus and movement toward Christ rather than a limited set of shared beliefs and values.\n\nJohn Wimber utilized the centered set understanding of membership in his Vineyard Churches. The centered set theory of Christian Churches came largely from missional anthropologist Paul Hiebert. The centered set understanding of membership allows for a clear vision of the focal point, the ability to move toward that point without being tied down to smaller diversions, a sense of total egalitarianism with respect for differing opinions, and an authority moved from individual members to the existing center.\n\nThe movement favors the sharing of experiences via testimonies, prayer, group recitation, sharing meals and other communal practices, which they believe are more personal and sincere than propositional presentations of the Gospel. Teachers in the emerging church tend to view the Bible and its stories through a lens which they believe finds significance and meaning for their community's social and personal stories rather than for the purpose of finding cross-cultural, propositional absolutes regarding salvation and conduct.\n\nThe emerging church claims they are creating a safe environment for those with opinions ordinarily rejected within modern conservative evangelicalism and fundamentalism. Non-critical, interfaith dialog is preferred over dogmatically-driven evangelism in the movement. Story and narrative replaces the dogmatic:\n\nThose in the movement do not engage in aggressive apologetics or confrontational evangelism in the traditional sense, preferring to encourage the freedom to discover truth through conversation and relationships with the Christian community.\n\nThe limits of interreligious conversation were tested in 2006 Emergent Village coordinator Tony Jones co-convened the first encounter of Emergent church and \"Jewish emergent\" leaders in a meeting co-hosted by Synagogue 3000, a Jewish nonprofit group. Emergent church scholar Ryan Bolger documented the meeting in a scholarly article co-authored with one of the organizers, while Jones recounted the episode, which had drawn criticism from conservative Christians, in his book \"The New Christians: Dispatches from the Emergent Frontier\".\n\nWhile some Evangelicals emphasize eternal salvation, many in the emerging church emphasize the here and now. Participants in this movement assert that the incarnation of Christ informs their theology. They believe that as God entered the world in human form, adherents enter (individually and communally) into the context around them and aim to transform that culture through local involvement. This holistic involvement may take many forms, including social activism, hospitality and acts of kindness. This beneficent involvement in culture is part of what is called missional living. Missional living leads to a focus on temporal and social issues, in contrast with a perceived evangelical overemphasis on salvation. Drawing on research and models of contextual theology, Mobsby asserts that the emerging church is using different models of contextual theology than conservative evangelicals, who tend to use a \"translation\" model of contextual theology (which has been criticized for being colonialist and condescending toward other cultures); the emerging church tends to use a \"synthetic\" or \"transcendent\" model of contextual theology. The emerging church has charged many conservative evangelical churches with withdrawal from involvement in contextual mission and seeking the contextualization of the gospel.\n\nMany emerging churches have put a strong emphasis on contextualization and, therefore, contextual theology. Contextual theology has been defined as \"A way of doing theology in which one takes into account: the spirit and message of the gospel; the tradition of the Christian people; the culture in which one is theologising; and social change in that culture.\" Emerging churches, drawing on this synthetic (or transcendent) model of contextual theology, seek to have a high view towards the Bible, the Christian people, culture, humanity and justice. It is this \"both...and\" approach that distinguishes contextual theology.\n\nEmerging communities participate in social action, community involvement, global justice and sacrificial hospitality in an effort to know and share God's grace. At a conference entitled \"The Emerging Church Forum\" in 2006, John Franke said “The Church of Jesus Christ is not the goal of the Gospel, just the instrument of the extension of God’s mission.” “The Church has been slow to recognize that missions isn’t (sic) a program the Church administers, it is the very core of the Church’s reason for being.” This focus on missional living and practicing radical hospitality has led many emerging churches to deepen what they are doing by developing a rhythm of life, and a vision of missional loving engagement with the world.\n\nProponents of the movement communicate and interact through fluid and open networks because the movement is decentralized with little institutional coordination. Because of the participation values named earlier, being community through participation affects the governance of most Emerging Churches. Participants avoid power relationships, attempting to gather in ways specific to their local context. In this way some in the movement share with the house church movements a willingness to challenge traditional church structures/organizations though they also respect the different expressions of traditional Christian denominations.\n\nInternational research suggests that some Emerging Churches are utilizing a Trinitarian basis to being church through what Avery Dulles calls 'The Mystical Communion Model of Church'.\n\nDulles sees the strength in this approach being acceptable to both Protestant and Catholic:\n\nThis can involve everything from expressive, neocharismatic style of worship and the use of contemporary music and films to more ancient liturgical customs and eclectic expressions of spirituality, with the goal of making the church gathering reflect the local community's tastes.\n\nEmerging church practitioners are happy to take elements of worship from a wide variety of historic traditions, including traditions of the Catholic Church, the Anglican churches, the Orthodox churches, and Celtic Christianity. From these and other religious traditions emerging church groups take, adapt and blend various historic church practices including liturgy, prayer beads, icons, spiritual direction, the labyrinth, and lectio divina. The Emerging Church is also sometimes called the \"Ancient-Future\" church.\n\nOne of the key social drives in Western Post-industrialised countries, is the rise in new/old forms of mysticism. This rise in spirituality appears to be driven by the effects of consumerism, globalisation and advances in information technology. Therefore, the Emerging Church is operating in a new context of postmodern spirituality, as a new form of mysticism. This capitalizes on the social shift in starting assumptions from the situation that most are regarded as materialist/atheist (the modern position), to the fact that many people now believe in and are searching for something more spiritual (postmodern view). This has been characterised as a major shift from religion to spirituality.\n\nSo, in the new world of 'spiritual tourism', the Emerging Church Movement is seeking to missionally assist people to shift from being spiritual tourists to Christian pilgrims. Many are drawing on ancient Christian resources recontextualised into the contemporary such as contemplation and contemplative forms of prayer, symbolic multi-sensory worship, story telling and many others. This again has required a change in focus as the majority of unchurched and dechurched people are seeking 'something that works' rather than something that is 'true'.\n\nEmerging-church groups use the Internet as a medium of decentralized communication. Church websites are used as announcement boards for community activity, and they are generally a hub for more participation based new technologies such as blogs, Facebook groups, Twitter accounts, etc. The use of the blog is an especially popular and appropriate means of communication within the Emerging church. Through blogs, members converse about theology, philosophy, art, culture, politics, and social justice, both among their local congregations and across the broader Emerging community. These blogs can be seen to embrace both sacred and secular culture side-by-side as an excellent example of the church's focus on contextual theology.\n\nDrawing on a more 'Missional Morality' that again turns to the synoptic gospels of Christ, many emerging-church groups draw on an understanding of God seeking to restore all things back into restored relationship. This emphasises God's graceful love approach to discipleship, in following Christ who identified with the socially excluded and ill, in opposition to the Pharisees and Sadducees and their purity rules.\n\nUnder this movement, traditional Christians' emphasis on either individual salvation, end-times theology or the prosperity gospel have been challenged. Many people in the movement express concern for what they consider to be the practical manifestation of God's kingdom on earth, by which they mean social justice. This concern manifests itself in a variety of ways depending on the local community and in ways they believe transcend \"modernist\" labels of \"conservative\" and \"liberal.\" This concern for justice is expressed in such things as feeding the poor, visiting the sick and prisoners, stopping contemporary slavery, critiquing systemic and coercive power structures with \"postcolonial hermeneutics,\" and working for environmental causes.\n\nDrawing on the success of Christian emerging church movements, a 'Jewish Emergent' movement has come into being, often conducting dialogue with evangelical Christian emergent movements. Synagogue 3000 describes its mission as \"challenging and promising alternatives to traditional synagogue structures\"—participants in the movement conduct worship outside of a traditional synagogue environment and attempt to engage with younger non-practising Jews.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2304605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304605", "title": "George Edalji", "text": "George Edalji\n\nGeorge Ernest Thompson Edalji (22 January 1876 – 17 June 1953) was an English solicitor of Parsi descent and son of a vicar in a South Staffordshire village who served three years' hard labour after being convicted on a charge of injuring a pony. He was pardoned after a campaign in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle took a prominent role.\n\nThe difficulty in overturning the conviction of Edalji was cited as showing that a better mechanism was needed for reviewing unsafe verdicts, and it was a factor in the 1907 creation of the Court of Criminal Appeal for England.\n\nEdalji was the eldest of the three children. His mother was Charlotte Edalji (\"née\" Stoneham), the daughter of a Shropshire vicar. His father was the Reverend Shapurji Edalji, a convert from a Bombay Parsi family. He had served as the curate in several parishes before being given the living as vicar of St. Mark's, Great Wyrley. The right to make this appointment lay with the bishop, and the Reverend Edalji obtained the position through the previous incumbent, his wife's uncle, who arranged it as a wedding present. Livings were much sought after because they were scarce and conferred valuable emoluments.\n\nThe Reverend Edalji moved into the vicarage in late 1875, a large house with its own grounds; George, the first child, was born there soon after. The Reverend Edalji was more assertive than his predecessor and was sometimes involved in controversy about parish business. Many modern writers on the case express the opinion that rural English society was infected with backward racialist attitudes, and that this would have been particularly true of a village like Great Wyrley. An aristocratic former army officer named Captain the Honorable G.A. Anson was the Chief Constable of Staffordshire during the case. He is widely seen as having expressed a racist attitude toward the Edaljis.\n\nAnonymous threatening letters were sent to the vicarage in 1888, when George Edalji was twelve and a half, demanding that the Reverend order a particular newspaper and threatening to break windows if this was not done. He ignored them. Windows were broken and a threat was made to shoot the Reverend; he became alarmed and called in the police. Graffiti was written slandering the Edaljis on the inside and outside walls of the vicarage. Pseudonymous letters were sent to the vicarage maid-of-all-work, 17 year-old Elizabeth Foster, threatening to shoot her when her \"Black master\" was out. One was found inside the hall with the envelope wet; the letter was written on pages from the exercise books of the Edalji children.\n\nThe circumstances made it clear that either Foster or Edalji was responsible. Foster was implicated by assertions made by Edalji; the Reverend, his wife, and police Sergeant Upton thought that they perceived similarities between Foster's handwriting and that of the pseudonymous threatening letters. The Reverend prosecuted Foster for writing the letters, which she denied doing. He offered to drop the case if Foster confessed, but she refused and went to live with an aunt. Foster, unable to pay for a defense at trial, pleaded guilty in front of the magistrates in exchange for being given probation, but continued maintaining her innocence thereafter. The Reverend congratulated Upton for his performance.\n\nIn 1892, a member of the parish council named W.H. Brookes received obscene letters that included accounts of his adult daughter sexually abusing her 10 year-old sister. The letters mentioned Edalji among others at first, but increasingly concentrated on Edalji and the Reverend, sometimes using a phrase (\"the blackman\") that had occurred in 1888 letters attributed to Elizabeth Foster. One letter was made in two distinctly different handwritings. The letters to Brookes accused his son of writing the 1888 letters to the vicarage which had been attributed to Elizabeth Foster, and of giving them to George Edalji to post. Reverend Edalji and a vicarage servant also got letters, in which the Reverend was accused of \"gross immorality with persons using Vaseline in the same way as did Oscar Wilde\". Letters purporting to be from the Reverend Edalji were sent to other vicars. Brookes and Reverend Edalji called in the police, and Sergeant Upton again found himself investigating poison pen letters to the vicar. Attempts to get the post office to identify the sender failed as the mailed letters ceased. Notes began appearing at the vicarage (a total of over 70), and various objects were left on the doorstep, including a bag of excrement. Police kept watch and claimed to have established that a stolen key had appeared on the doorstep in a time frame when only George Edalji had used the entrance. Following this, excrement was smeared on the outside of upstairs windows, and Upton decided that George had been responsible for the letters.\n\nA police ploy was unsuccessful which was clearly aimed at getting Edalji to incriminate himself as the note writer, and it brought forth protests from his mother at the way the investigation was focusing on him. She and her husband demanded that Foster be arrested. A campaign of hoax ordering of goods and services for the vicarage lasted for 3 years. Police largely ceased investigating the incidents. In response to her protests, Chief Constable of the county Captain Anson told Mrs. Edalji that she should make a serious effort to help catch the culprit if she wanted his men to spend more time on the matter, as it was obviously either her husband or son. Reverend Edalji threatened to complain to higher authority about the conduct of Anson. The notes and hoaxes ceased in December 1895.\n\nBrookes came to believe that Edalji was the author of the 1892 poison pen letters. He said that Edalji had smiled at him in the railway station, to which Brookes had responded with a disagreeable look; therefore, Brookes asserted, the letters began to refer to him as \"sour face\". Brookes also said that the letters to him stopped after he got out of a train and swung punches at Edalji on the platform, because he was peering in the compartments.\n\nEdalji was hired at a legal firm as a trainee solicitor and scored exceptionally high marks in his professional examinations. In 1899, his family helped him set up on his own as a newly qualified solicitor, working out of an office in Birmingham and sometimes from the vicarage.\n\nHe was described as looking younger than his age, of a rather peculiar appearance, and solitary, being given to taking evening strolls by himself. A couple of roughs were fined for hitting him while he was walking three miles from his house one night in 1900; the assailants were not from Great Wyrley or known to Edalji.\n\nHis book \"Railway Law for the ‘Man in the train’\" was published in 1901. In the same year, solicitor and clerk to the court C.A. Loxton accused Edalji of writing \"immoral and offensive\" allegations on walls about Loxton and his fiancée.\n\nMost present-day comment on the case takes the view that the traditional culture in a Staffordshire village of the time would make George Edalji an object of suspicion because of his racial heritage – yet Edalji's younger brother Horace does not seem to have encountered any difficulties with locals or the authorities. \n\nWhen Edalji was 27 years old in 1903, a series of slashings occurred against horses and other livestock, known as the 'Great Wyrley Outrages'. A horse was maimed on 1 February 1903, then two horses were similarly wounded on 29 June 1903, and a number of other animals received injuries resulting in their being put down. Isolated cases of livestock maiming were not unheard of as a way of settling scores in farming communities, but the series of attacks provoked a public outcry far beyond the area.\n\nPolice received pseudonymous letters purporting to be from one of a gang of culprits, and the letters named real people as members of the gang, including Edalji. Several others named in the letters were schoolboys whom Edalji regularly commuted with in the same train compartment. A letter was also sent to Edalji purporting to be from one of them, 15-year-old Wilfred Greatorex.\n\nStaffordshire Chief Constable Captain Anson was an administrator without experience of investigatory police work. He believed that Edalji was the author of the letters, but that he had no involvement in the animal maimings due to his professional status. Inspector Campbell headed enquiries into the maimings and, from an early stage, considered Edalji a person of particular interest, although there were a number of suspects.\n\nThe exact nature is not known regarding the circumstantial evidence that led to suspicion falling on Edalji; according to what Anson privately alleged years later, Edalji was seen 'prowling' the area at night and, on two occasions, trails of footprints from attack locations seemed to lead to the vicarage, and most of the crimes had occurred within a half mile radius of the vicarage. On 29 June, two horses were mutilated. Following this, the seventh attack, Campbell felt sure that Edalji was responsible for the maimings because he reportedly had been seen late on that night in the field where it took place.\n\nInspector Campbell began to focus on Edalji for the mutilations. Then a July 1903 letter threateningly predicted that \"little girls\" would be the target of the next attacks. Anson agreed to a watch being kept on the vicarage and nearby countryside. There were rumours that Edalji was going to be arrested for the attacks, and he offered a reward for information about who was spreading them. His habit of taking walks continued, and he returned from one at around 9 pm on 17 August.\n\nEarly on 18 August, a wounded pony was discovered, half a mile from the scene of the first attack. Inspector Campbell sent a constable to the railway station where Edalji was waiting to catch his train, asking him to help with inquiries, but he declined and left for Birmingham. Inspector Campbell went to the vicarage with a sergeant and constable, and asked to see any weapons in the house; a small trowel was the only thing shown to them. Edalji's clothing was also asked for; it included muddy boots as well as mud-stained serge trousers and a housecoat—both of which the police said were damp. The inspector said that there was a hair on the housecoat, whereupon there was a dispute between the Inspector and the Reverend over whether something visible on the housecoat was a hair or a loose thread.\n\nThe next day, police searched the vicarage and found a case with four razors in the bedroom that Edalji shared with his father. Reverend Edalji said that the razors were old ones not in use. According to the police, they pointed out that one razor was wet; the Reverend took it and wiped the blade with his thumb; he later said that this was not true. Police said that a heel on the boots was worn down in an unusual way and left a distinctive pattern on the ground that matched heel impressions in an alleged trail of footprints between the vicarage and the scene of the crime. A local doctor who examined the housecoat for the police said that it was bloodstained, and there were 29 hairs on it similar to ones from the pony's hide near the wound. The doctor said that the hairs were small and difficult to see.\n\nHome Office officials later considered it highly unlikely that police would have gone on to fabricate evidence by planting the hairs after the Edaljis had vehemently drawn attention to the absence of hairs on the housecoat while it was handed over.\n\nEdalji consistently maintained that he was innocent of all charges. He pleaded not guilty to injuring the pony; an indictment was not tried for sending a letter threatening to kill a policeman. The trial was moved out of the village, which meant that the jury was of people who did not know Edalji. The prosecution accused Edalji of having left the house and attacked the pony in the early hours of the morning. The Reverend said that he had hardly slept that night and knew that Edalji could not have left the bedroom which they shared, the door of which he had locked as usual. According to Richard Davenport-Hines, writing in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\".\n\nThe case arrayed against young Edalji was preposterous. As an astigmatic myopic he was incapable of complicated nocturnal excursions; the vicarage was surrounded on the night of 17 August by a cordon of men through which he could not have penetrated; apparently incriminating dirty razors found in a police search of the vicarage were stained with rust, not blood; putatively incriminating mud found on his clothes and boots did not come from the field where the horse was slaughtered; horse hairs which police claimed to have found on his coat were probably threads; his father’s sworn oath that they had slept the night in the same room behind a locked door was disregarded. After George Edalji was condemned to seven years’ penal servitude, his family was brutally baited.\n\nEdalji was convicted and sentenced to seven years hard labour. Edalji’s defence did not mention his eyesight; Edalji later said that he had been told by his lawyers that the prosecution case was so weak that he was sure to be acquitted, and thus it was unnecessary to bring up how poor his vision was. Some 10,000 signatures, including hundreds from lawyers, were on petitions that protested the conviction. Some legal figures thought that it was improper under English evidence law for Edalji to be sent for trial charged with separate offences of sending a threatening letter and a pony maiming, and then having evidence about letters used to help convict him of the maiming, which was the sole offence for which he was tried.\n\nR.D. Yelverton, former Chief Justice in the Bahamas, thought that the case for the prosecution had been conclusively disproved. He asked: “How could a gentleman in the position and of the education of Mr. Edalji, be supposed to write the following, put by the Prosecution before the Jury, as written by him. (They were sent either to the Police or to himself). ‘You great hulking blackguard and coward I have got you fixed you dirty Cad – bloody monkey!’”\n\nSenior civil servants at the Home Office reviewed the case and reported that there were no serious flaws in the trial and conviction of Edalji. He was paroled after serving three years.\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle, then second only to Rudyard Kipling as a celebrated British writer, became the most influential supporter of the public campaign for Edalji’s pardon. The weight that Conan Doyle’s opinion on the case carried with the public stemmed from the appeal of his fictional master detective Sherlock Holmes, which associated the author with Holmesian traits of close attention to detail and drawing logical inferences. These were valid principles that outlined the scientific method, according to Maria Konnikova. Boiled down, the idea was that cool reflection on what “an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way” enabled one “to use observation to deduce meaning from an otherwise meaningless fact.” In contrast, the natural human tendency was to “spontaneously construct narratives, and firmly believe in their veracity”, which – as Konnikova writes – is exemplified by the cognitive style of Dr. Watson, in which “it is incredibly difficult to resist our desire to form narratives, to tell stories even if they may not be altogether correct, or correct at all.” As his creator admitted, Holmes was an idealised reasoner without light or shade.\n\nConan Doyle arrived to meet with Edalji at a hotel after becoming interested in the case, and he recalled that he paused to study Edalji, who was passing the time reading a newspaper while waiting in the lobby. On observing how Edalji held the paper at an angle inches from his face, Conan Doyle was convinced that Edalji was innocent; he believed it impossible for someone with eyesight as bad as Edalji’s to have moved through the countryside after nightfall attacking animals and successfully evading the police.\n\nAnson corresponded with Conan Doyle and met with him in January 1907 to discuss the case, but relations became acrimonious between them two days later when Anson was informed by Conan Doyle that he intended to campaign for Edalji to be given a pardon. Anson thought that a firm conclusion could not have been reached from a neutral standpoint in that amount of time, and that Conan Doyle had obtained his co-operation and an interview by misrepresenting himself as having no settled opinion about the case. Conan Doyle wrote to the Home Office saying that Anson had implied homosexual incest between the Reverend and Edalji. Anson insisted that he did no such thing.\n\nThe same day that Conan Doyle wrote his letter of intent to Captain Anson, a long pseudonymous letter was sent to Conan Doyle, Edalji, and Anson with apparent inside knowledge of the arguments which Conan Doyle intended to publish, the first of a spate about the case that they received. It purported to be by a private detective who had been summoned to the vicarage; this was similar to an ingenious deception perpetrated during the hoax campaign of 1892, when a female private detective was led to believe that she was working for Mrs. Edalji to investigate suspected infidelity by the Reverend. It has been questioned whether the detailed knowledge of incidents at the vicarage and Edaji’s professional life that were demonstrated in the letter could have come from anyone not at the center of those events or part of the investigation into them. Attribution of the letters is further complicated by police having used the ploy of sending pseudonymous letters to Edalji on a couple of occasions before his arrest.\n\nThe “private detective” letter of 1907 ostensibly offered to help Edalji, but seemed to be an obvious trap. It has been suggested that the letters were aimed at disrupting the campaign to have him granted a pardon. The police handwriting consultant said that the letter was by Edalji in his ‘Greatorex’ hand. Police believed that such letters had ceased while Edalji was in prison, and they attributed those pseudonymous or anonymous letters about the case received when Edalji was in gaol to persons other than the author of the 1903 pseudonymous ‘Greatorex’ letters, which police believed was Edalji. Poison pen letters in the name of the “Wyrley Gang” continued until the 1930s, by an offender who also wrote to people connected to other crimes in the news. \n\nConan Doyle became an active investigator, going to the crime scenes, interviewing participants, and critiquing the reliability of the witness who testified that peculiarities found in the handwriting of Edalji also occurred in the 1903 pseudonymous ‘Greatorex’ letters to police, which named Edalji as a culprit in the animal mutilations. Legal technicalities made the evidence controversial concerning the letters being used to convict Edalji, because he was not tried on the charge of sending a threatening letter. Opinion within the Home Office was split on the matter. Conan Doyle thought that he had identified the person as a certain Royden Sharp who was behind the pseudonymous letters of 1892 and 1903 and the maimings. There have been a variety of opinions since about whether he was justified in his belief, although Peter Costello wrote a modern book on Conan Doyle’s investigations and concurred with his conclusion.\n\nNewspapers suggested that visual impairment would have made it impossible for Edalji to have committed the crime. Captain Anson told the Home Office that he thought that Edalji was physically more than capable of the nocturnal maiming, asserting that Edalji had a panther-like gait and eyes that “came out with a strange sort of glow, like a cat’s eyes” in a low light. According to Anson's communications with the Home Office about the case, an assertion was “indisputably false” that Edalji made in a letter published in a newspaper to the effect that he was not abroad after nightfall. Anson said that several people remembered coming across Edalji very late at night and miles from his house during 1903.\n\nConan Doyle’s articles in support may have been a key factor in getting the authorities to commission a committee of inquiry. Edalji was granted a pardon for the maiming conviction in May 1907, though the inquiry found that he had brought prosecution upon himself by sending the pseudonymous ‘Greatorex’ letters to police during the summer of 1903, which meant that he was not given compensation.\n\nEdalji’s case and the associated campaign were factors in the creation of England’s Court of Criminal Appeal in 1907. A June 1907 memo by Home secretary Herbert Gladstone was discovered 80 years later, which revealed that one of the lawyers who had represented Edalji had privately told Gladstone of suppressing a letter by Edalji, which his brother Horace had brought as a specimen of Edalji’s handwriting, because it was damaging to the defence’s case. It consisted of obscenities similar to ones that Edalji was accused of sending. When the 1907 letters started, the lawyer’s colleague remarked “He is at it again.”\n\nIn November 1907, Edalji was accepted back on to the roll of solicitors in good standing and allowed to practice, despite the Committee of Inquiry’s conclusion that he had written some of the 1903 letters. His sister Maud moved in with him, and they lived together in Welwyn Garden City until his death in 1953.

{"id": "824327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=824327", "title": "Glory Season", "text": "Glory Season\n\nGlory Season is a 1993 science fiction novel by David Brin. It was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1994. An announcement in the back of one edition of \"Earth\" is for a novel titled \"Stratos\", to be released in the spring of 1992. It seems likely that this was delayed, and renamed \"Glory Season\".\n\nThree thousand years before the story starts, Lysos founds a human colony on the isolated planet of Stratos in an effort to radically re-engineer human life into a happier, more pastoral form. She developed a strain of human beings that conceives clones in winter (always female), while those conceived in summer (variants or \"vars\") obtain their genes through sexual reproduction just in case biological adaptation becomes necessary. Further, males and females have opposed seasons of sexual receptivity: men in summer and women in winter. This scheme is said to be stable over evolutionary time because women gain an advantage from self-cloning, while men only reproduce in summer. Finally, men have been made far less aggressive during the times that they are less sexually receptive and are much less numerous. The social result is that the vast majority of the population of Stratos consists of groups of female clones, each in its own social or economic niche. Over the centuries, these groups have come to dominate society. Men are confined to relatively few professions (such as sailing) and have a lower social status than clones, but higher than vars. In each generation, a few women vars become successful enough to found their own clan or \"hive\" of clones.\n\nAs is customary, clones are trained to carry on their clan's business, while vars leave as young adults to seek their fortune. It is time for identical twins Maia and Leie to enter the outside world. They plan to work as sailors to gain experience and explore Stratos, find their niche, and found a clan. Almost immediately, they hit a snag. The only two ship's captains willing to take them on at that time insist they split up, because they cannot have it appear to their clone passengers that clones are doing lowly ship's work. The ships are traveling together. Aboard, Maia meets Naroin, a highly competent female bosun's mate. Later, Leie's ship is lost in a storm. Maia is heartbroken and seriously injured, but eventually recuperates and finds a job on a railroad.\n\nOn the railroad, Maia discovers her var temporary assistant is actually a clone courier and courtesan running illegal drugs. The drugs are designed to shift a man's period of sexual interest. They are part of a plot by reactionary \"Perkinites\" (named after Charlotte Perkins Gilman, author of \"Herland\") to minimize the role of men in an isolated valley, and perhaps later all of Stratos.\n\nMaia notifies the \"Planetary Equilibrium Authority\", but is kidnapped and imprisoned by the Perkinites. She discovers that Renna, a prisoner in another cell, is transmitting messages electrically. She talks with Renna by code and develops a friendship with her unseen fellow inmate. When she discovers that Renna is being transferred somewhere else, Maia engineers her escape, only to find that idealistic radicals (\"rads\") and their allies have already freed Renna, who is actually the \"Visitor,\" a \"male\" envoy from the rest of humanity whose arrival has triggered great debate among the leaders of Stratos as to how to respond to the renewed - and unwanted - contact. She tags along with Renna and the rads.\n\nA platonic friendship develops between Renna and Maia. Their group, which includes Naroin, is later overtaken at sea by pirates (pirating being a tolerated, legal activity). During the ensuing boarding fight, Maia is shocked when she encounters her sister, one of the pirates. The pirates win, with the help of traitors planted in the rads' group. They strand many of their female prisoners, including Maia and Naroin, and one young male sailor named Brod on a deserted island and take Renna, their prize, to a secret base.\n\nAfter the castaways manage to ambush pirates sent to eliminate all witnesses, they sail off to alert the authorities, but Maia, accompanied only by Brod, sets out to try to rescue Renna. They inadvertently stumble upon the pirate base. While secretly reconnoitering it, Maia helps free more prisoners, including the rads and the crew of her ship. She also learns that Renna has somehow escaped. More fighting breaks out when their enemies learn the rest of their prisoners are loose. In the turmoil, Maia and her allies are cornered, but she finds a secret exit which leads to the long-lost \"Jellicoe Former\", an advanced manufacturing facility that can produce anything. Renna is killed when the spaceship he found and completed at Jellicoe Former explodes soon after its launch. Maia is severely injured in the battle. The police and other interested parties arrive to save the survivors of Maia's side.\n\nWhile recuperating, Maia is dragged into politics and kept a prisoner discreetly by one clan because she has become a symbol. She tells her story to a group of male heads of sailing clans. One of them turns out to be the father she had never known. For her actions, they offer her \"clan\" an alliance. At the end, with Renna dead, Maia becomes an embarrassment to her captors, so she is allowed to walk away free. She decides that she will not found a clan of clones, but rather have offspring the old way.\n\nThe nature of the novel is a subject of some contention, some believing that the setting is a feminist utopia, others holding it to be a dystopian work functioning as a post-feminist critique of feminism. The structure of the society is complex enough to make either interpretation possible, though the society's origin and structure is based on an extreme of separatist feminism. Also, the structure of the society as seen within the narrative supports the view of biological determinism when it comes to the relationship between genetics and gender roles.\n\nThe author, in the novel's afterword, explains that the idea for the society in which the story takes place originated from a study of reproductive cycle of aphids, which is heterogamous. Aphids alternate between asexual reproduction in the Summer, i.e., when the environment is favorable and there is plenty of food, and sexually in the Fall when the organism is stressed by its environment. This has the biological advantage of ensuring identical copies of the parent will be well suited to take advantage of the favorable conditions, and variation in offspring in a stressful environment in hopes some of the offspring will find the environment favorable, even when the parents do not. The entire social construct in the novel is therefore an extrapolation of this idea onto a human culture, where successful female clans (female, because only they can produce offspring) can take advantage of their sociological niches by producing exact copies, and unsuccessful females produce variable offspring sexually. One could argue that successful human organizations such as the clans require a variety of personality types and individuals of complementary skill sets to be successful as an organization. While this criticism is not directly addressed, it might act as a limiter on how large a particular clan could grow, since inevitably a large organizational structure would require specialization of tasks for which none of the clan members may be suited.\n\n\n"}

She was the only Queen of Travancore to have reigned in her own right which she did for two years before becoming a regent.\n\nGouri Lakshmi Bayi was born in the year 1791 to Princess Attham Thirunal, Senior Rani of Attingal of the Travancore Royal Family, adopted sister of Maharajah Balarama Varma. Attham Thirunal was adopted into the Travancore family from Kolathunad in 1788. The Maharanis of Travancore were styled as the \"Ranis of Attingal\". Gowri Lakshmi Bayi was one of Travancore's most popular Queens and introduced several reforms in the state.\n\nThe unpopular Maharajah Bala Rama Varma, during whose reign Travancore faced a number of internal and external problems, revolts and unnecessary battles and conspiracies, including the most important revolt of Velu Thampi Dalawa, died in 1811. At the death of the Maharajah, Gowri Lakshmi Bayi, the senior Rani of Attingal, was barely twenty years of age. There were no eligible male members in the family which meant she would have to take over Travancore and rule it as regent till such an heir would be born to her. However her accession was not easy because a member from the Mavelikara branch of the royal family, a distant cousin, Prince Kerala Varma, who was the pet of the previous ruler, staked a claim on the throne which was anything but substantiated. The Princess placed in the hands of the British Resident Col. John Munro, one of Travancore's most loved British Residents, a document asserting her claim and proving the claim of Kerala Varma untenable. This irked Kerala Varma who resorted to tact and tried to convince the Princess to give up her claim. However the Resident sided with Gowri Lakshmi Bayi and she was made the Regent Maharani of Travancore in 1811. Kerala Varma was permitted to reside at Trivandrum, the capital; but when he tried to create further troubles, he was imprisoned and banished from Travancore.\n\nOne of the earliest acts of Regent Gowri Lakshmi Bayi was to dismiss the existing Dewan or Prime Minister, Ummini Thampi. Ummini Thampi was accused of squandering money and acquiring all the property of the vanquished rebel freedom fighter Velu Thampi Dalawa and others. He was dismissed and when he tried to cause further trouble he was imprisoned and punished after being found guilty of conspiracy against the Regent Maharani Gowri Lakshmi Bayi. The Maharani was now asked to nominate some individual for the post of Dewan, to which she stated that she found no eligible individual and would like to appoint the Resident Colonel John Munro as her Dewan. Accordingly, Munro became Dewan of Travancore in 1811.\n\n\n\nIn 1814, Colonel John Munro resigned his Dewanship as it was not a permanent arrangement for the Resident to take that post. In his stead the Judge of the Appeal Court, Devan Padmanabhan was appointed as Dewan. However he soon after died from smallpox. In his place, one of Col. Munro's assistants, Bappu Rao, was appointed as Dewan of Travancore in that same year.\n\nThe Maharani was married to a Koil Thampuran, Prince Rajaraja Varma Avargal of the Changanassery Royal Family. From this marriage Gowri Lakshmi Bayi had issue two sons and a daughter. Her daughter was Maharani Gowri Rukmini Bayi born in 1809. Her eldest son was born on 16 April 1813, the famous King Swathi Thirunal who was a musician and artist and ruled independently from 1829-1846. He married a lady who belonged to the Thiruvattar Ammaveedu family. The Maharani next had a son in 1814, Maharajah Uthram Thirunal who ruled from 1846-1860. The Maharani Gowri Lakshmi Bayi started losing her health after giving birth to Uthram Thirunal and died in 1815. She was succeeded as Regent Maharani by her sister, Gowri Parvati Bayi. Her only daughter, who was now the only female in the matriarchal Travancore Royal Family, Gowri Rukmini Bayi married Rama Varma Koil Thampuran of Thiruvalla Royal Family in 1819 and had seven children, five sons and two daughters. One of these daughters died soon while the other married and had two sons, including Moolam Thirunal Sir Rama Varma. She too died in 1857 after the birth of Moolam Thirunal and so in 1858 two princesses were adopted from the Mavelikara Royal family into Travancore.\n\nHer Highness Sri Padmanabha Sevini Vanchi Dharma Vardhini Raja Rajeshwari Maharani Ayilyam Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi, Attingal Mootha Thampuran, Maharani of Travancore.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "486856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=486856", "title": "Maria Malibran", "text": "Maria Malibran\n\nMaria Felicia Malibran (24 March 1808 – 23 September 1836) was a Spanish mezzo-soprano who commonly sang both contralto and soprano parts, and was one of the best-known opera singers of the 19th century. Malibran was known for her stormy personality and dramatic intensity, becoming a legendary figure after her death at age 28. Contemporary accounts of her voice describe its range, power and flexibility as extraordinary.\n\nMalibran was born in Paris as María Felicitas García Sitches into a famous Spanish musical family. Her father, Manuel García, was a celebrated tenor much admired by Rossini, having created the role of Count Almaviva in his \"The Barber of Seville\". García was also a composer and an influential vocal instructor, and he was her first voice teacher. He was described as inflexible and tyrannical; the lessons he gave his daughter became constant quarrels between two powerful egos.\n\nMalibran first appeared on stage in Naples with her father in Paër’s \"Agnese\", when she was 8 years old. When she was 17, she was a singer in the choir of the King's Theatre in London. When prima donna Giuditta Pasta became indisposed, García suggested that his daughter take over in the role of Rosina in \"The Barber of Seville\". The audience loved the young mezzo, and she continued to sing this role until the end of the season.\n\nWhen the season closed, García immediately took his operatic troupe to New York. The troupe consisted primarily of the members of his family: Maria, her brother, Manuel, and their mother, Joaquina Sitchez, also called \"la Briones\". Maria's younger sister, Pauline, who would later become a famous singer in her own right under the name of Pauline Viardot, was then only four years old.\n\nThis was the first time that Italian opera was performed in New York. Over a period of nine months, Maria sang the lead roles in eight operas, two of which were written by her father. In New York, she met and hastily married a banker, Francois Eugene Malibran, who was 28 years her senior. It is thought that her father forced Maria to marry him in return for the banker's promise to give Manuel García 100,000 francs. However, according to other accounts, she married simply to escape her tyrannical father. A few months after the wedding, her husband declared bankruptcy, and Maria was forced to support him through her performances. After a year, she left Malibran and returned to Europe.\n\nIn Europe, Malibran sang the title role at the premiere of Donizetti's \"Maria Stuarda\". The opera was based on Friedrich Schiller's play \"Mary Stuart\", and as it portrayed Mary, Queen of Scots in a sympathetic light, censors demanded textual amendments, which Malibran often ignored. The Library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels conserves a series of interesting coloured costume projects for this play, created by Malibran, revealing her unsuspected drawing talent.\n\nMalibran became romantically involved with the Belgian violinist, Charles Auguste de Bériot. The pair lived together as a common-law couple for six years and a child was born to them in 1833 (the piano pedagogue Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot), before Maria obtained an annulment of her marriage to Malibran. Felix Mendelssohn wrote an aria accompanied by a solo violin especially for the couple. Malibran sang at the Paris Opera among other major opera houses. In Paris, she met and performed with Michael Balfe.\n\nIn 1834, Malibran moved to England and began to perform in London. In late May 1836, she starred in \"The Maid of Artois\", written for her by Balfe. Earlier that year she had returned to Milan to sing the title role in the premiere of Vaccai's \"Giovanna Gray\". In July 1836, Malibran fell from her horse and suffered injuries from which she never recovered. She refused to see a physician and continued to perform. In September 1836 Malibran was in Manchester participating in a music festival at the collegiate church and Theatre Royal on Fountain Street. She collapsed on stage while performing encores at the theatre, but insisted on performing in the church the following morning and died after a week of agony, attended by her private physician. Her body was temporarily buried in the church after a public funeral before being moved to a mausoleum in Laeken Cemetery, near Brussels in Belgium.\n\nMalibran is most closely associated with the operas of Rossini. The composer extolled her virtues:\n\nAmong other operas, she sang the title role in \"Tancredi\" and in \"Otello\", in which it appears that she sang both the roles of Desdemona and of Otello. Other appearances included those in \"Il turco in Italia\", \"La Cenerentola\", and \"Semiramide\" (both Arsace and the title role).\n\nShe also sang in Giacomo Meyerbeer's \"Il crociato in Egitto\" in Paris in September 1825, an opera which Rossini, as director of the Théâtre-Italien, introduced to the French capital and \"which launched Meyerbeer's European reputation\". Malibran enjoyed great success in Bellini's operas \"Norma\", \"La sonnambula\" and \"I Capuleti e i Montecchi\" (as Romeo). She also sang the Romeo role in two other then-famous operas: \"Giulietta e Romeo\" by Zingarelli and \"Giulietta e Romeo\" by Vaccai. Bellini wrote a new version of his \"I puritani\" to adapt it to her mezzo-soprano voice and even promised to write a new opera especially for her, but he died before he was able to do so.\n\nMalibran's tessitura (comfortable vocal range) was remarkably wide, from G below middle C to high E (G – E), and her extreme range extended from D3 to F6 in \"altissimo\", which allowed her easily to sing roles for contralto as well as high soprano. Her contemporaries admired Malibran's emotional intensity on stage. Rossini, Donizetti, Chopin, Mendelssohn and Liszt were among her fans. The painter Eugène Delacroix however, accused her of lacking refinement and class and of trying to \"appeal to the masses who have no artistic taste.\" Describing her voice and technique, French critic Castil-Blaze wrote, \"Malibran's voice was vibrant, full of brightness and vigor. Without ever losing her flattering timbre, this velvet tone that has given her so much seduction in tender and passionate arias. [...] Vivacity, accuracy, ascending chromatics runs, arpeggios, vocal lines dazzling with strength, grace or coquetry, she possessed all that the art can acquire.\"\n\nThe Library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels possesses an important collection of scores, documents and objects from the diva, assembled in the Maria Malibran fund.\n\nSeveral films depict the life of Maria Malibran:\n\nIn 1982, soprano Joan Sutherland did a recital tour called \"Malibran\" in order to revive Malibran's memory, singing pages from the singer's favourites in Venice.\n\nThe mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli dedicated her 2007 album \"Maria\" to the music composed for Malibran and her most famous roles, as well as an extensive tour and DVD concert dedicated to La Malibran. In 2008 Decca released a recording Bellini's \"La Sonnambula\" with Cecilia Bartoli in the lead role using many cadenzas that la Malibran herself used and which restored the tessitura of the role to the high mezzo-soprano range (as Giuditta Pasta and Maria Malibran had sung it).\n\nShe appears as a character in a poem by William McGonagall.\n\nNotes\nCited sources\n\nOther sources\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55503308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55503308", "title": "Maternal fetal stress transfer", "text": "Maternal fetal stress transfer\n\nMaternal fetal stress transfer describes the physiological phenomenon by which psychosocial stress experienced by a mother during her pregnancy can be transferred to the fetus. Psychosocial stress (or simply social stress) describes the brain's physiological response to perceived social threat. Because of a link in blood supply between a mother and fetus, it has been found that stress can leave lasting effects on a developing fetus, even before a child is born. According to recent studies, these effects are mainly the result of two particular stress biomarkers circulating in the maternal blood supply: cortisol and catecholamines.\n\nCortisol is type of hormone called a glucocorticoid, which glucose usage in the body and tends to be activated during a fight-or-flight response. Cortisol is produced in the adrenal gland, whose activity is mediated by the hypothalamus and pituitary glands of the brain. Together, the collective signaling of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal gland is known as the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. During a period of psychosocial stress, cortisol is released, leading to physiological manifestations of stress such as increased maternal blood pressure (MBP) and maternal heart rate (MHR).\n\nIn the case of a pregnant woman, the release of cortisol from the adrenal glands also has an effect on the fetus being carried in the womb. Cortisol is a steroid hormone, and, like all steroid hormones, the receptors for cortisol are located intracellularly. In other words, cortisol does not need an extracellular receptor in order to enter the nucleus of cells and affect their gene expression. Because of this feature of steroid hormones, cortisol diffuses directly across the placenta, the barrier that separates the fetus from the mother. Luckily, the fetus has a protective mechanism against the inundation of cortisol from a stressed mother. There is an enzyme in the placenta called 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 that is capable of inactivating the vast majority of the cortisol passing through the placental barrier to the fetus. \n\nIn cases of very high levels of maternal cortisol, this placental enzyme’s expression and activity are greatly reduced, thus buffering the fetus less from the mother’s high cortisol levels. There are detrimental effects to this loss of placental enzymatic activity. One such effect is a change in the set point for the HPA axis. Myriad studies in animal models indicate that, if fetal cortisol levels are high, then the HPA axis will be more active postnatally. \n\nHigh levels of fetal cortisol induce higher CRH expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and the central nucleus of the amygdala. In other words, excessive cortisol crossing the placental barrier causes the hypothalamus and amygdala to increase transcription of CRH, which in turn stimulates HPA axis activity early in postnatal life. With such an overactive HPA axis, glucocorticoid receptor expression in the brain increases, making it so that the release of minimal levels of cortisol elicit a substantial response at developing synapses. It is speculated that the HPA axis will more rapidly develop its neural circuitry as a result.\n\n\n"}

Anoxic depolarization is induced by the loss of neuronal selective membrane permeability and the ion gradients across the membrane that are needed to support neuronal activity. Normally, the Na+/K+-ATPase pump maintains the transmembrane gradients of K and Na ions, but with anoxic brain injury, the supply of energy to drive this pump is lost. The hallmarks of anoxic depolarization are increased concentrations of extracellular K ions, intracellular Na and Ca ions, and extracellular glutamate and aspartate. Glutamate and aspartate are normally present as the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitters, but high concentrations activate a number of downstream apoptotic and necrotic pathways. This results in neuronal dysfunction and death.\n\nNeurons function in the central nervous system by generating signals from synapses, and this only works in the proper chemical environment. An electrical signal is mediated by the sodium channels and leaky potassium channels in which intracellular K ion concentration is higher than its corresponding extracellular concentration, whereas extracellular concentrations of Na, Ca, and Cl ions are higher than the corresponding intracellular concentrations. This uneven distribution of ions is maintained by the Na/K ATPase pump which actively pumps Na out and K into the cell in a ratio of 3:2 per ATP used. A neuron has a resting membrane potential of -70mV due to the leaky potassium channels. As a neuron depolarizes due to Na ion influx through the sodium channels, the membrane reaches a threshold potential and then fires an all or none action potential, which either propagates down the axon or passes on to the other neurons via several gap junctions that link them.\n\nA chemical signal (synaptic transmission) begins with the action potential that propagates down the axon of so-called presynaptic terminal to trigger Ca influx, which causes the synaptic vesicles to fuse and release neurotransmitters, via exocytosis, to the synaptic cleft. Released neurotransmitters then bind their specific neuroreceptors at the postsynaptic membrane, or activate their specific ligand-gated ion channels, to fire an action potential that can be either excitatory or inhibitory, depending on the nature of the ligand-gated ion channel. Neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft by either enzymatic degradation or re-uptake by the same presynaptic neuron, via endocytosis or specific neurotransmitter transporters.\n\nWithin a few seconds of stroke onset, the brain responds by entering a state of metabolic depression, in which energy consumption is reduced to compensate for the reduction in energy production. Metabolic depression occurs as a result of suppressed synaptic transmission and hyperpolarization.\n\nThe suppression of synaptic transmission occurs because the presynaptic impulse temporarily fails to trigger the release of neurotransmitters, which, coupled with the altered ion conductance and a change in postsynaptic neuroreceptors, makes synapses unresponsive to neurotransmitter binding, thereby inhibiting postsynaptic excitation.\n\nHyperpolarization, on the other hand, is employed to reduce neuronal activity by establishing a high threshold potential for firing across an action potential. This energy-conserving response is due to the continuous inward current of K ions, which help maintain the membrane ion gradient until the resistance is broken and anoxic depolarization begins.\n\nMaintaining a balance between the intracellular and extracellular ionic concentrations at the postsynaptic terminal is critical to normal neuronal function. During oxygen depletion to the brain, two events that initiate, as well as propagate, anoxic depolarization involve excessive cationic influxes, as well as the outflow of ATP, at the postsynaptic terminal. The receptors that allow this influx and outflow are the ionotropic receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels that bind specific neurotransmitters, released from the synaptic vesicles of the presynaptic terminal, to trigger the opening of the channels, which serve as conduits for cations that, in turn, initiate action potential across the post synaptic terminals of normally functioning neurons.\n\nThe key player in the dramatic process of cationic influx is glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter that triggers excitotoxicity during anoxic depolarization. A number of ionotropic receptors have been identified as contributing to anoxic depolarization of nerve cell membranes. They include the NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, P2X7 purinergic receptors, pannexin channels (Panx1), transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, and acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs).\n\nDuring brain ischemia, glutamate is released in excess from the presynaptic terminal, leading to the uncontrollable opening of the glutamate receptors, including the NMDA and AMPA receptors, which allows for an excessive influx of Ca into the intracellular environment. Purinergic and NMDA receptors activate the pannexin-1 channels, which become hyperactive and allow the release of ATP from the intracellular environment. As the extracellular glutamate and ATP increase, several complexes are activated and converge into apoptotic and necrotic cascade pathways, which cause neuronal damage and death.\n\nIn the aftermath of anoxic depolarization, at the region of infarction, the release of glutamate and aspartate into the extracellular space causes an uncontrollable intracellular mobilization of Ca, mainly through the NMDA receptors. This is a critical stage in the development of neuronal damage, because it is the Ca overload that gives rise to several downstream cascades of events that lead to necrotic neuronal death, or to apoptosis, including free radical and nitric oxide productions that cause damage to the membrane.\n\nAnother cytotoxic event that follows anoxic depolarization is lactate accumulation and acidosis as a result of glycolysis, which causes damage to the mitochondria. Ischemic insult also causes blood-brain barrier disruption. Other consequential damage that occurs includes lipolysis, proteolysis, cell swelling, microtubule disaggregation, and DNA fragmentation.\n\nNeurons are more susceptible to brain ischemia than the supporting glial cells, because neurons have higher energy demand, conduct an action potential, and produce glutamate, whereas glial cells lack those properties. Yet neurons differ among themselves in their sensitivity to ischemia, depending on the specific properties they exhibit, relating to their locations in the brain.\n\n\"Selective vulnerability\" is the term used to describe how some parts of the brain are more sensitive to anoxia than others, and thus to ischemic insult. Anoxia-prone cells in the brain include the hippocampal pyramidal cells of CA1, cerebellar purkinje cells, pyramidal neocortical neurons in some layers, basal ganglia, reticular neurons of the thalamus, and brainstem neurons.\n\nWhile basal ganglia, cerebellar purkinje cells, hippocampal, and neocortical cells are more vulnerable to transient ischemic attack (TIA), brainstem and thalamic reticular neurons are more vulnerable to prolonged ischemic attack (stroke proper). Meanwhile, the hippocampal pyramidal cells have been identified as the most vulnerable cells to ischemia. One possible explanation for why selective vulnerability exists attributes the phenomenon to the different amounts of glutamate produced by different neurons, since it is glutamate release to the synaptic cleft that triggers Ca influx, which in turn triggers biochemical processes that damage the neurons. In other research, variation in the expression of immediate early gene and heat shock protein was identified as causing selective vulnerability.\n\nThe painted turtle (\"Chrysemys picta\") uses the mechanism of metabolic depression to combat oxygen depletion. Within a few minutes of anoxia onset in the turtle's brain there is decreased cerebral blood flow that eventually ceases. Meanwhile, glycolysis is stimulated to maintain a near optimum ATP production. This compensatory stimulation of glycolysis occurs because, in the turtle's brain, cytochrome a and a have a low affinity for oxygen. Anaerobic glycolysis leads to lactate overload, which the turtle buffers to some extent by increased shell and bone CaCO production.\n\nHowever, glycolysis is not efficient for ATP production, and in order to maintain an optimum ATP concentration, the turtle's brain reduces its ATP consumption by suppressing its neuronal activity and gradually releasing adenosine. This re-establishes the ATP consumption/production balance, which is then maintained by reducing ion conductance and releasing GABA. The decrease in neuronal activity renders the turtle comatose for the duration of anoxia.\n\nAnother anoxia-tolerant animal that is commonly used as a model to study anoxia in the mammalian brain is the crucian carp, which can survive at even more extreme anoxic conditions than the painted turtle can. Unlike \"C. picta\", which takes such drastic measures in becoming comatose to maintain an optimum ATP concentration, the crucian carp does not become comatose in anoxia. Instead, it stays active by maintaining its normal cardial output as well as increasing its cerebral blood flow. Even though glycolysis is stimulated early in anoxia in both the crucian carp and \"C. picta\", the crucian carp is able to stay active because of its capability to re-route the glycolytic pathway such that lactate is converted into ethanol, which can then be released into the water via the gills, thus preventing lactate overload and acidosis.\n\nSince the crucian carp has a more efficient strategy to prevent lactate buildup than \"C. picta\", the initial glycolysis continues without ceasing, a process called the Pasteur effect. In order to keep up with this fast glucose metabolism via glycolysis, as well as maintain the balance between ATP production and consumption, the crucian carp moderately suppresses its motor activities, releases GABA, and selectively suppresses some unnecessary sensory functions. Crucian carp also counteracts the damaging effects of anoxia by swimming into cooler water, a phenomenon known as \"voluntary hypothermia\".\n\nThe brains of several mammalian neonates have been identified as able to confer resistance to anoxia in a fashion similar to that of the anoxic-tolerant aquatic organisms. This is still a relatively new area of study that could have a clinical significance in combating stroke in humans. A study that looked into anoxic-tolerance in newborn mammals identified two main ways in which they cope with acute hypoxia. While most newborns, preferentially, depress their metabolic rate to conserve energy during anoxia, some mammalian newborns—such as the pig, the deer, and other animals in their class, which are capable of a high degree of independent activity from birth—employ hyperpnoea (abnormally rapid or deep breathing). Why metabolic depression is less effective in adult mammals, compared to neonates, is unclear at the moment. Due to ethical issues, anoxic-tolerance has not been tested in human neonates.\n\nCurrently, there is no effective way to combat stroke. The only FDA-approved drug to treat stroke is a clot-dissolving, genetically-engineered enzyme called tissue plasminogen activator, which must be administered within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms, in order to be effective in reducing damage following ischemic stroke.\n\nMany clinical trials have failed in an attempt to develop effective neuroprotective drugs to combat stroke, perhaps because those drugs only deal with one aspect of stroke, and therefore neglect the fact that stroke is a multifaceted problem. Some of the potential treatments for stroke that have been tested by a number of researchers, using several animal models, involve sigma-1 receptor ligands, to modulate Ca release, NMDA receptor antagonists, to prevent Ca overload, and ion channel blockers, to prevent excessive ion fluxes.\n\n"}

In 1991, at the age of 35, she stated that she had a near-death experience (NDE) during a brain operation performed by Robert F. Spetzler at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. Her experience is one of the most widely documented in near-death studies because of the circumstances under which it happened. Reynolds was under close medical monitoring during the entire operation. During part of the operation she had no brain-wave activity and no blood flowing in her brain, which rendered her clinically dead. She claimed to have made several observations during the procedure which later medical personnel reported to be accurate.\n\nThis near-death experience claim has been considered by some to be evidence of the survival of consciousness after death, and of a life after death. However, others have pointed to prosaic and conventional means as possible explanations. Reynolds died from heart failure, on Saturday May 22, 2010, age 53 at Emory University Hospital, in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nPam Reynolds reported to her physician that she was experiencing symptoms of dizziness, loss of speech and difficulty in moving parts of her body. Her physician referred her to a neurologist and a CAT scan later revealed that Reynolds had a large aneurysm in her brain, close to the brain stem. Because of the difficult position of the aneurysm, Reynolds was predicted to have no chance of surviving surgery for its removal. As a last resort, Robert F. Spetzler — a neurosurgeon of the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona — decided that a rarely performed procedure, known as hypothermic cardiac arrest, could improve Reynolds's chances of surviving surgical removal of the aneurysm. During this procedure, also known as a standstill operation, Reynolds's body temperature was lowered to 50 °F (10 °C), her breathing and heartbeat stopped, and the blood drained from her head. Her eyes were closed with tape and small ear plugs with speakers were placed in her ears. These speakers emitted audible clicks which were used to check the function of the brain stem to ensure that she had a flat EEG — or a non-responsive brain — before the operation proceeded. The operation was a success and Reynolds recovered completely. The total surgery lasted about seven hours with a few complications along the way.\n\nReynolds reported that during the operation she heard a sound like a natural 'D' that seemed to pull her out of her body and allowed her to \"float\" above the operating room and watch the doctors perform the operation. Reynolds claims that during this time she felt \"more aware than normal\" and her vision was more focused and clearer than normal vision. She reported seeing the surgical \"saw\" but said it looked like an electric toothbrush, and this is in fact true. She said she could hear conversations between operating room staff, even though she had earphones in her ears which were making a loud clicking noise many times per second in order to monitor her brain function.\n\nAt some point during the operation, she says she noticed a presence and was pulled towards a light. (Cardiologist Michael Sabom in his book \"Light and Death\" says that this occurred during a period in which her brain had completely ceased to function, but it is not clear that it occurred during this period.) She says she began to discern figures in the light, including her grandmother, an uncle, other deceased relatives and people unknown to her. According to Reynolds, the longer she was there, the more she enjoyed it, but at some point she was reminded that she had to go back. She says her uncle brought her back to her body, but she didn't want to go, so he pushed her in accompanied by a sensation like that of jumping into ice water.\n\nReynolds' near-death experience has been put forward as evidence supporting an afterlife by proponents such as cardiologist Michael Sabom in his book \"Light and Death\". Critics say that the amount of time which Reynolds was 'flatlined' is generally misrepresented and suggest that her NDE occurred while under general anaesthesia when the brain was still active, hours before Reynolds underwent hypothermic cardiac arrest.\n\nAnesthesiologist Gerald Woerlee analyzed the case, and concluded that Reynolds' ability to perceive events during her surgery was the result of \"anesthesia awareness\".\n\nAccording to the psychologist Chris French:\n\nWoerlee, an anesthesiologist with many years of clinical experience, has considered this case in detail and remains unconvinced of the need for a paranormal explanation... [He] draws attention to the fact that Reynolds could only give a report of her experience some time after she recovered from the anesthetic as she was still intubated when she regained consciousness. This would provide some opportunity for her to associate and elaborate upon the sensations she had experienced during the operation with her existing knowledge and expectations. The fact that she described the small pneumatic saw used in the operation also does not impress Woerlee. As he points out, the saw sounds like and, to some extent, looks like the pneumatic drills used by dentists.\n\n\n\n"}

The purpose of the position is to elevate the legs above the heart in a manner that will help blood flow to the heart.\n\nThis test involves raising the legs of a person's (without their active participation), which causes gravity to pull blood from the legs, thus increasing circulatory volume available to the heart (cardiac preload) by around 150-300 milliliters, depending on the amount of venous reservoir. The real-time effects of this maneuver on hemodynamic parameters such as blood pressure and heart rate are used to guide the decision whether or not more fluid will be beneficial. The assessment is easier when invasive monitoring is present (such as an arterial catheter).\n\nThe maneuver might be reinforced in a clinical setting by moving the patient's bed from a semi-recumbent position to a recumbent position with the legs raised. This is theorised to cause an additional mobilisation of blood from the gastrointestinal circulation. Direct measurement of cardiac output is the more reliable comparing to the measurement of blood pressure or pulse pressure because of pulse pressure amplification during this procedure. Cardiac output can be measured by arterial pulse contour analysis, echocardiography, esophageal Doppler, or contour analysis of the volume clamp-derived arterial pressure. Any bronchial secretions must be aspirated before performing this test. The legs should not be elevated manually because it may provoke pain, discomfort, or awakening that can cause adrenergic stimulation, giving false readings of cardiac output by increasing heart rate. After the maneuver, the bed should be placed back into semi-recumbent position with cardiac output measured again. The cardiac output should return to the values measured before the initiation of this maneuver. This test can be can used to access fluid responsiveness without any fluid challenge, where the latter can lead to fluid overload. Compression stockings should be removed before the test so that adequate volume of blood will return to the right heart during the maneuver. The physiology of assessing fluid responsiveness via passive leg raise requires increasing systemic venous return without altering cardiac function - a form of functional hemodynamic monitoring.\n\nSeveral studies showed that this measure is a better predictor of response to rapid fluid loading than other tests such as respiratory variation in pulse pressure or echocardiographic markers.\n\nPlacing the person in the Trendelenburg position, does not work since bloodvessels are highly compliant, and expand as result of the increased volume locally. More suitable would be the use of vasopressors.\n\n"}

The 1981–82 Dunbar Poets finished the season at 29-0 during Lewis' junior season and finished 31-0 during his senior season, and were ranked first in the nation by USA Today.\n\nLewis attended Northeastern University in Boston. Over his four years at Northeastern, Lewis scored 2,708 points, still the all-time record at the university. His Northeastern teams won the ECAC North in each of his four seasons, and played in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament every year. The 1983–84 Huskies advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament, falling one point shy of the Sweet 16 when Rolando Lamb scored at the buzzer to lift VCU over the Huskies.\n\nHis uniform number was retired and hangs in tribute in Matthews Arena (the home of Northeastern University's men's basketball team and the Celtics' original home arena in 1946). As a Celtic, he and his family lived in Dedham, Massachusetts. He was a second cousin of current Boston Celtics player P. J. Dozier, who wore the jersey number 35 as a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder in honor of Lewis.\n\nLewis was drafted in the first round, 22nd overall, by the Boston Celtics in the 1987 NBA draft. The Celtics were looking to add some youth to the team, especially for the aging \"Big 3\" of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish. This need became more urgent after Len Bias, the 2nd overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft, died of a cocaine overdose.\n\nAs a rookie, Lewis played sporadically, averaging only 8.3 minutes per game under coach K.C. Jones. By his second season, thanks in part to a new coach (and an injury to Celtics star Larry Bird) Lewis averaged over 30 minutes per game and scored 18.5 points per game. Lewis was selected to play in his first and only NBA All-Star Game held in Orlando, Florida, 1992. He played 15 minutes, scoring 7 points and grabbing 4 rebounds.\n\nHe averaged 20.8 points per game in each of his last two seasons with the Celtics, and finished with a career average of 17.6 points per contest.\n\nHis #35 jersey was retired by the Celtics as a memorial to him, making him one of only two Celtics to have a retired number without winning a championship. The other was Ed Macauley, who did win a championship with the St. Louis Hawks in 1958 and is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nLewis suffered sudden cardiac death on the basketball court at an off-season practice on July 27, 1993, at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. He was 27 years old. Lewis had shown symptoms of heart problems in the preceding months (including collapsing during the opening game of the Celtics' first-round playoff series with the Charlotte Hornets), and the cause of his death was subsequently attributed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a structural heart defect that is considered the most common cause of death in young athletes. James Crowley, a Brandeis University police officer who happened upon the gym on a routine patrol, and another Brandeis University police officer attempted to revive Lewis by using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but they were unsuccessful.\n\nFollowing Lewis' death, it was alleged that Lewis had used cocaine, and that drug use may have been a contributing factor in his death. However, the \"Wall Street Journal\" reported that physicians \"suspected that cocaine killed Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis...but they were thwarted by actions by his family and a 'dismissive' policy toward drugs by the NBA.\" The \"Journal\" added the following:\n\nWhether Mr. Lewis died from a heart damaged by cocaine -- as many doctors suspected then and now -- cannot be definitively shown. What is evident: The official cause of death, a heart damaged by a common-cold virus, is a medically nonsensical finding by a coroner who was under intense pressure from the Lewis family to exclude any implication of drug use.\n\nThe Boston Celtics responded by expressing sadness about the \"vicious attack on Reggie Lewis and his family\", and threatened \"to file a $100 million lawsuit against the reporter, \"The Wall Street Journal\" and its parent company, Dow Jones and Co. Inc.\" Dr. Gilbert Mudge, a doctor who treated Lewis, was sued for malpractice in connection with Lewis' death; in written responses to questions from the attorneys for Donna Harris-Lewis, Mudge said that \"16 days before Lewis collapsed from a heart attack in 1993, he acknowledged having used cocaine, but said he had stopped.\" On the other hand, the doctor who performed the autopsy on Lewis testified that the scarring on his heart was inconsistent with cocaine use, and other doctors reached the same conclusion though they \"stopped short of saying he never used drugs.\" Also, Lewis's heart tissue tested positive for adenovirus during his autopsy, and his son has a heart condition very similar to his father's.\n\nAfter Lewis' death, the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center was opened in Roxbury, Boston. The center was funded partially by Lewis and routinely hosts major indoor track and field competitions, the Boston Indoor Games, home basketball games for Roxbury Community College, and Northeastern University track and field events.\n\nOn March 22, 1995, the Boston Celtics retired Lewis' jersey. Lewis had worn the number 35 for his entire career. During the ceremony, former teammate Dee Brown made a speech while two other former teammates, Sherman Douglas and Xavier McDaniel, held up Lewis' framed jersey. Lewis' contract remained on the Celtics' salary cap for two full seasons after his death because at the time the NBA did not have a provision to void contracts in the event an active player died; NBA Commissioner David Stern said that the remaining NBA teams should approve an exemption for Lewis' contract but the rest of the league, many of whom had spent years or even decades losing to the Celtics on the court, said that they would do no such thing to help Boston. The rules have since been changed so that a similar case would result in a deceased player's contract being paid by league insurance, with the entirety of the remaining balance immediately erased from a team's salary cap charges (similar conditions are now part of contracts for players with career-ending medical issues, as was shown when the Miami Heat and the NBA's insurance carrier reached a deal to jointly pay Chris Bosh the full balance of his contract and removed 100% of the contract from the Heat's salary cap).\n\nLewis is buried in an unmarked grave in Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.\n\n"}

{"id": "42595150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42595150", "title": "Self-tiling tile set", "text": "Self-tiling tile set\n\nA self-tiling tile set, or \"setiset\", of order \"n\" is a set of \"n\" shapes or pieces, usually planar, each of which can be tiled with smaller replicas of the complete set of \"n\" shapes. That is, the \"n\" shapes can be assembled in \"n\" different ways so as to create larger copies of themselves, where the increase in scale is the same in each case. Figure 1 shows an example for \"n\" = 4 using distinctly shaped decominoes. The concept can be extended to include pieces of higher dimension. The name setisets was coined by Lee Sallows in 2012, but the problem of finding such sets for \"n\" = 4 was asked decades previously by C. Dudley Langford, and examples for polyaboloes (discovered by Martin Gardner, Wade E. Philpott and others) and polyominoes (discovered by Maurice J. Povah) were previously published by Gardner.\n\nFrom the above definition it follows that a setiset composed of \"n\" identical pieces is the same thing as a 'self-replicating tile' or rep-tile, of which setisets are therefore a generalization. Setisets using \"n\" distinct shapes, such as Figure 1, are called \"perfect\". Figure 2 shows an example for \"n\" = 4 which is \"imperfect\" because two of the component shapes are the same.\nThe shapes employed in a setiset need not be \"connected\" regions. Disjoint pieces composed of two or more separated islands are also permitted. Such pieces are described as \"disconnected\", or \"weakly-connected\" (when islands join only at a point), as seen in the setiset shown in Figure 3.\n\nThe fewest number of pieces in a setiset is two. Figure 4 encapsulates an infinite family of order 2 setisets each composed of two triangles, \"P\" and \"Q\". As shown, the latter can be hinged together to produce a compound triangle that has the same shape as \"P\" or \"Q\", depending upon whether the hinge is fully open or fully closed. This unusual specimen thus provides an example of a hinged dissection.\n\nThe properties of setisets mean that their pieces form substitution tilings, or tessellations in which the prototiles can be dissected or combined so as to yield smaller or larger duplicates of themselves. Clearly, the twin actions of forming still larger and larger copies (known as inflation), or still smaller and smaller dissections (deflation), can be repeated indefinitely. In this way, setisets can produce non-periodic tilings. However, none of the non-periodic tilings thus far discovered qualify as aperiodic, because the prototiles can always be rearranged so as to yield a periodic tiling. Figure 5 shows the first two stages of inflation of an order 4 set leading to a non-periodic tiling.\n\nBesides self-tiling tile sets, which can be interpreted as loops of length 1, there exist longer loops, or closed chains of sets, in which every set tiles its successor. Figure 6 shows a pair of mutually tiling sets of decominoes, in other words, a loop of length 2. Sallows and Schotel did an exhaustive search of order 4 sets that are composed of octominoes. In addition to seven ordinary setisets (i.e., loops of length 1) they found a bewildering variety of loops of every length up to a maximum of 14. The total number of loops identified was nearly one and a half million. More research in this area remains to be done, but it seems safe to suppose that other shapes may also entail loops.\nTo date, two methods have been used for producing setisets. In the case of sets composed of shapes such as polyominoes, which entail integral piece sizes, a brute force search by computer is possible, so long as \"n\", the number of pieces involved, is not prohibitive. It is easily shown that \"n\" must then be a perfect square. Figures 1,2,3,5 and 6 are all examples found by this method.\n\nAlternatively, there exists a method whereby multiple copies of a rep-tile can be dissected in certain ways so as to yield shapes that create setisets. Figures 7 and 8 show setisets produced by this means, in which each piece is the union of 2 and 3 rep-tiles, respectively. In Figure 8 can be seen how the 9 pieces above together tile the 3 rep-tile shapes below, while each of the 9 pieces is itself formed by the union of 3 such rep-tile shapes. Hence each shape can be tiled with smaller duplicates of the entire set of 9.\n\n"}

{"id": "164646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164646", "title": "Transcendentalism", "text": "Transcendentalism\n\nTranscendentalism is a philosophical movement that developed in the late 1820s and 1830s in the eastern United States. It arose as a reaction to protest against the general state of intellectualism and spirituality at the time. The doctrine of the Unitarian church as taught at Harvard Divinity School was of particular interest.\n\nTranscendentalism emerged from \"English and German Romanticism, the Biblical criticism of Johann Gottfried Herder and Friedrich Schleiermacher, the skepticism of David Hume\", and the transcendental philosophy of Immanuel Kant and German Idealism. Miller and Versluis regard Emanuel Swedenborg as a pervasive influence on transcendentalism. It was also strongly influenced by Hindu texts on philosophy of the mind and spirituality, especially the Upanishads.\n\nA core belief of transcendentalism is in the inherent goodness of people and nature. Adherents believe that society and its institutions have corrupted the purity of the individual, and they have faith that people are at their best when truly \"self-reliant\" and independent.\n\nTranscendentalism emphasizes subjective intuition over objective empiricism. Adherents believe that individuals are capable of generating completely original insights with little attention and deference to past masters.\n\nTranscendentalism is closely related to Unitarianism, the dominant religious movement in Boston in the early nineteenth century. It started to develop after Unitarianism took hold at Harvard University, following the elections of Henry Ware as the Hollis Professor of Divinity in 1805 and of John Thornton Kirkland as President in 1810. Transcendentalism was not a rejection of Unitarianism; rather, it developed as an organic consequence of the Unitarian emphasis on free conscience and the value of intellectual reason. The transcendentalists were not content with the sobriety, mildness, and calm rationalism of Unitarianism. Instead, they longed for a more intense spiritual experience. Thus, transcendentalism was not born as a counter-movement to Unitarianism, but as a parallel movement to the very ideas introduced by the Unitarians.\n\nTranscendentalism became a coherent movement and a sacred organization with the founding of the Transcendental Club in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on September 8, 1836 by prominent New England intellectuals, including George Putnam (1807–78, the Unitarian minister in Roxbury), Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Frederic Henry Hedge. From 1840, the group frequently published in their journal \"The Dial\", along with other venues.\n\nBy the late 1840s, Emerson believed that the movement was dying out, and even more so after the death of Margaret Fuller in 1850. \"All that can be said,\" Emerson wrote, \"is that she represents an interesting hour and group in American cultivation.\" There was, however, a second wave of transcendentalists, including Moncure Conway, Octavius Brooks Frothingham, Samuel Longfellow and Franklin Benjamin Sanborn. Notably, the transgression of the spirit, most often evoked by the poet's prosaic voice, is said to endow in the reader a sense of purposefulness. This is the underlying theme in the majority of transcendentalist essays and papers—all of which are centered on subjects which assert a love for individual expression. Though the group was mostly made up of struggling aesthetes, the wealthiest among them was Samuel Gray Ward, who, after a few contributions to \"The Dial\", focused on his banking career.\n\nTranscendentalists are strong believers in the power of the individual. It focuses primarily on personal freedom. Their beliefs are closely linked with those of the Romantics, but differ by an attempt to embrace or, at least, to not oppose the empiricism of science.\n\nTranscendentalists desire to ground their religion and philosophy in principles based upon the German Romanticism of Herder and Schleiermacher. Transcendentalism merged \"English and German Romanticism, the Biblical criticism of Herder and Schleiermacher, and the skepticism of Hume\", and the transcendental philosophy of Immanuel Kant (and of German Idealism more generally), interpreting Kant's a priori categories as a priori knowledge. Early transcendentalists were largely unacquainted with German philosophy in the original and relied primarily on the writings of Thomas Carlyle, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Victor Cousin, Germaine de Staël, and other English and French commentators for their knowledge of it. The transcendental movement can be described as an American outgrowth of English Romanticism.\n\nTranscendentalists believe that society and its institutions—particularly organized religion and political parties—corrupt the purity of the individual. They have faith that people are at their best when truly \"self-reliant\" and independent. It is only from such real individuals that true community can form.\nEven with this necessary individuality, transcendentalists also believe that all people are outlets for the \"Over-soul.\" Because the Over-soul is one, this unites all people as one being. Emerson alludes to this concept in the introduction of the \"American Scholar\" address, \"that there is One Man, - present to all particular men only partially, or through one faculty; and that you must take the whole society to find the whole man.\" Such an ideal is in harmony with Transcendentalist individualism, as each person is empowered to behold within him or herself a piece of the divine Over-soul.\n\nTranscendentalism has been directly influenced by Indian religions. Thoreau in \"Walden\" spoke of the Transcendentalists' debt to Indian religions directly:\nIn 1844, the first English translation of the Lotus Sutra was included in \"The Dial\", a publication of the New England Transcendentalists, translated from French by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody. \n\nTranscendentalists differ in their interpretations of the practical aims of will. Some adherents link it with utopian social change; Brownson, for example, connected it with early socialism, but others consider it an exclusively individualist and idealist project. Emerson believed the latter; in his 1842 lecture \"The Transcendentalist\", he suggested that the goal of a purely transcendental outlook on life was impossible to attain in practice: \n\nTranscendentalism is, in many aspects, the first notable American intellectual movement. It has inspired succeeding generations of American intellectuals, as well as some literary movements.\n\nTranscendentalism influenced the growing movement of \"Mental Sciences\" of the mid-19th century, which would later become known as the New Thought movement. New Thought considers Emerson its intellectual father. Emma Curtis Hopkins \"the teacher of teachers\", Ernest Holmes, founder of Religious Science, the Fillmores, founders of Unity, and Malinda Cramer and Nona L. Brooks, the founders of Divine Science, were all greatly influenced by Transcendentalism.\n\nTranscendentalism also influenced Hinduism. Ram Mohan Roy (1772–1833), the founder of the Brahmo Samaj, rejected Hindu mythology, but also the Christian trinity. He found that Unitarianism came closest to true Christianity, and had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians, who were closely connected to the Transcendentalists. Ram Mohan Roy founded a missionary committee in Calcutta, and in 1828 asked for support for missionary activities from the American Unitarians. By 1829, Roy had abandoned the Unitarian Committee, but after Roy's death, the Brahmo Samaj kept close ties to the Unitarian Church, who strived towards a rational faith, social reform, and the joining of these two in a renewed religion. Its theology was called \"neo-Vedanta\" by Christian commentators, and has been highly influential in the modern popular understanding of Hinduism, but also of modern western spirituality, which re-imported the Unitarian influences in the disguise of the seemingly age-old Neo-Vedanta.\n\nMajor figures in the transcendentalist movement were Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, and Amos Bronson Alcott. Some other prominent transcendentalists included Louisa May Alcott, Charles Timothy Brooks, Orestes Brownson, William Ellery Channing, William Henry Channing, James Freeman Clarke, Christopher Pearse Cranch, John Sullivan Dwight, Convers Francis, William Henry Furness, Frederic Henry Hedge, Sylvester Judd, Theodore Parker, Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, George Ripley, Thomas Treadwell Stone, Jones Very, and Walt Whitman.\n\nEarly in the movement's history, the term \"Transcendentalists\" was used as a pejorative term by critics, who were suggesting their position was beyond sanity and reason.\n\nNathaniel Hawthorne wrote a novel, \"The Blithedale Romance\" (1852), satirizing the movement, and based it on his experiences at Brook Farm, a short-lived utopian community founded on transcendental principles.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe wrote a story, \"Never Bet the Devil Your Head\" (1841), in which he embedded elements of deep dislike for transcendentalism, calling its followers \"Frogpondians\" after the pond on Boston Common. The narrator ridiculed their writings by calling them \"metaphor-run\" lapsing into \"mysticism for mysticism's sake\", and called it a \"disease.\" The story specifically mentions the movement and its flagship journal \"The Dial\", though Poe denied that he had any specific targets. In Poe's essay \"The Philosophy of Composition\" (1846), he offers criticism denouncing \"the excess of the suggested meaning... which turns into prose (and that of the very flattest kind) the so-called poetry of the so-called transcendentalists.\"\n\n\n\n\nTopic sites\nEncyclopediae\n"}

In captivity they commonly grow up to ; in the wild they can achieve sizes of .\n\nIn the UK, there are just two known populations: in a pool and adjacent area in the Caerlaverock Wetlands in Scotland, and a temporary pond in the New Forest. The species is legally protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).\n\nThis species is considered to be one of the oldest living species on the planet at around 200 million years old. Fossils of this species from the Upper Triassic (Norian) period appear virtually unchanged compared to modern day members of the species.\n\n\"Triops cancriformis\" has a very fast life cycle, and individuals become mature in about two weeks after hatching. Their populations can be gonochoric, hermaphroditic or androdioecious. The latter is a very rare reproductive mode in animals, in which populations are made of hermaphrodites, with a small proportion of males. Due to this lack of males, early researchers thought Triops were parthenogenetic. The presence of testicular lobes scattered amongst their ovaries confirmed they were in fact hermaphroditic. Fertilized females or hermaphrodites produce diapausing eggs or cysts, able to survive decades in the sediment of the ponds and lakes they inhabit. These eggs are resistant to drought and temperature extremes.\n\nIn 1801, Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc made the first officially recognised species description of \"Triops cancriformis\". He named this species \"Apus cancriformis\". Other authors used the name \"Apus cancriformis\" over the years but often with the wrong original author of this name.\n\nIn 1909, Ludwig Keilhack used the correct name \"\"Triops cancriformis\" (Bosc)\" in a field identification key of the freshwater fauna of Germany. He took up the genus name proposed by Schrank and suggested that the genus name \"Apus\" be replaced with \"Triops\" Schrank since \"Apus\" had been used since 1777 as the genus name of some birds (commonly known as swifts). However, other authors disagreed with him and the controversy continued until the 1950s.\n\nIn 1955, Alan Longhurst provided the original author of \"T. cancriformis\" as \"\"Triops cancriformis\" (Bosc, 1801)\" with a full history of synonymy to support it. This was in a taxonomic review of the Notostraca that also supported using the genus name \"Triops\" instead of \"Apus\". In 1958, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) recognised the name \"Triops cancriformis\" (Bosc, 1801–1802) (ICZN name no. 1476) as officially the oldest. They also recognised the genus name \"Triops\" Schrank instead of \"Apus\". They followed Longhurst in these decisions.\n\nAlthough members of the genus \"Triops\" usually have no economic importance, the Beni-kabuto ebi albino variant of \"Triops cancriformis\" has been used to control mosquitoes and weeds in Asian rice fields.\n\n\"Triops cancriformis\" is the second most common species raised by hobbyists next to \"Triops longicaudatus\". They are particularly valued for their lower hatching temperature and somewhat longer lifespan as well as potentially larger size.\n"}
{"id": "42854327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42854327", "title": "Widow conservation", "text": "Widow conservation\n\nWidow conservation was a type of marriage in Protestant Europe in the early modern age, when the widow of a parish vicar was married to her husband's successor to ensure her economic support. This practice was common in Scandinavia (\"Änkekonservering\"/\"Enkekonservering\") and the Protestant parts of Germany (\"Konservierung von Pfarrwitwen\"). It is related to other forms of widow inheritance, including the levirate marriage known in the Old Testament as \"yibbum\".\n\nAt the introduction of the Protestant Reformation, priests were allowed to marry. However, as they did not own the vicarage and property attached to his profession, his spouse and issue were left without a home and means to support themselves after his death. The future support of the widows and children of vicars thereby became a concern for the various churches. The most common solution was that the successor of a vicar married the widow (or perhaps the daughter) of his predecessor, thereby \"conserving\" her.\n\nIn the United Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway, the \"Kirkeordinansen\" or Church charter of 1537, issued by Christian III of Denmark after the Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein, secured the widows of priests the right to a \"Naadensaar\" (Year of Grace), during which they were secured an income from the parish of their late spouses and residence at the vicarage. Other than that, however, nothing was done to provide for priests' widows, and when the year was over, they were left to support themselves as well as they could, often as midwives or by some small business enterprise in the closest town. In 1566, a recommendation was issued in which priests were lectured to show mercy to the widows of their predecessors and let them stay in the vicarage, and some vicarages established a widow's house adjoining their vicarage.\n\nThis proved to be insufficient, and by the early 17th-century, it had become customary for a parish to elect a vicar on condition that he marry the widow of his predecessor. There was never any formal law to require this, and if the parish protested to the authorities against a vicar who broke his promise after having been elected, their complaints were given no support by the crown: however, in practice this was an accepted custom which vicars adjusted to, and during the 17th century it was not uncommon for a woman to have been married to four priests in succession.\n\nIn 1659, the first local pension fund for vicars' widows was established. This gradually became a more popular option, but some parishes continued to practise widow conservation until the late 18th century.\n\nIn Mark Brandenburg, widow conservation was common practice in the 17th century.\n\nIn 1698, Frederick III of Brandenburg banned widow conservation by the \"Juramentum simoniae\" as being a form of purchase of the vicarage office.\n\nWidow conservation was common practice in East Prussia. The practice is here the center of the legend of \"Ännchen von Tharau\", which was inspired by the case of Anna Neander (1615–1689).\n\nThe first widow conservation of the kind is documented from 1551, and by 1580, it had become a common practice, which was recommended by the church order of 1602. By 1704, one third of all vicars' wives were the widow of the predecessor of her spouse.\n\nFrom 1623 onward, however, there was also an increasing number of widow funds, which made widow conservation less necessary. The last widow conservation took place in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn Pomerania, the church synod of 1545 saw no other choice but to tolerate the practice, and in 1572, the conservation of the widow or daughter of a vicar was officially declared the duty of his successor. An attempt to replace it with a dowry provided by the congregations in 1575 failed.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the practice started to decrease because of more alternatives, such as the foundation of a fund for vicars' widows in Swedish Pomerania in 1775.\n\nIn the Duchy of Saxony, a strong policy to prevent widow conservation was enforced already when it occurred in the 16th century, and attempts of having a successor of a vicar marry the widow or daughter of his predecessor were actually prevented and contested when it did occur.\n\nIn Sweden and Finland (then a Swedish province), the parish vicars were given permission to marry after the Swedish Reformation of 1527. The support of vicars' widows quickly became a concern: while priests and their families were being provided for by the income from their parish, this income was attached to their office, and the widow had no right to it after the death of the priest, which could place her in a difficult situation unless she, or her late spouse, had a personal fortune, which was normally not the case. After the death of a vicar, his widow was entitled to a \"Nådeår\" or \"Nådår\" (Year of Grace) to live on the vicarage while preparing support for herself and her children. During that year, the parish were to select the next vicar. As the parish and church considered it their duty to support the widow of their former vicar, they normally chose a priest who expressed himself willing to marry the widow of his predecessor. The vicar's widow herself also seems to have played a part in electing the next vicar by using the influence she had in the parish by her position as vicar's wife. Another way to arrange the support of the widow was for the next vicar to marry her adult daughter, if she had one, or that the son of a vicar succeeded him.\n\nIn the Swedish Church Ordinance 1571, the rules stated that the son or the son-in-law of the former vicar were to be considered first when a new parish vicar was chosen. During the 17th century, widow conservation was common practice and the majority of the vicar's wives were the widow or daughter of her husband's predecessor. The Swedish Church Law 1686 stated that when a new parish vicar was to be elected, the candidates who expressed themselves willing to marry the widow or daughter of his predecessor should be favored. This regulation was dropped in 1739, when the education of the vicars became the formal qualification to the office, but informally, the practice continued the entire 18th century, as the parishes continued to regard it their responsibility to support the vicars' wives, who were often locals and had strong positions in their parishes.\n\nThere were also parishes which were formally inherited this way. In 1591, King John III of Sweden granted the Annerstad parish in Småland to vicar Georgius Marci, to be inherited on both the male and female line by his descendants: either by a son, or by a successor married to a daughter or a widow of his predecessor. Upon the death of Marci in 1613, his parish was inherited by his son-in-law by marriage to his daughter, Kerstin Marca (1585–1653), who has been referred to as the first Swedish female to have formally inherited the right to a vicar's parish. The Annerstad parish was on several occasions inherited by females in the same fashion - such as for example by Gunilla Osængius in 1685 - until the year of 1780, when king Gustav III of Sweden refused the request of a vicars candidate to marry the 12-year-old daughter of the recently deceased vicar Anders Osængius.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, however, widow conservation quickly came out of use. The reasons were several: a different view upon marriage as more of a love union than a practical arrangement; that the education of the candidates, who were less often the sons of vicars, had become more important; and because the recently established retirement funds for vicar's widows made the solution less needed. The first retirement fund was \"Allmänna Änke- och Pupillkassan i Sverige\" from 1740, granting pensions to destitute widows of civil servants; this was not sufficient, and during the 19th-century, the \"Nådår\" was often prolonged upon application, until the more efficient retirement fund \"Prästerskapets Änke- och Pupillkassa\" exclusively for vicar's widows was established in 1874.\n\n\n"}

He made four trips into the interior between May 1777 and March 1780, when he departed. In 1789 Paterson published \"Narrative of Four Journeys into the Country of the Hottentots and Caffraria\", which he dedicated to Sir Joseph Banks.\n\nPaterson was originally commissioned as an ensign in the 98th Regiment of Foot and served in India. He later transferred to the 73rd Regiment of Foot after the 98th's disbandment in 1787. In 1789, he was promoted to captain in the New South Wales Corps, serving under Major Francis Grose. After some time spent recruiting, he arrived in Sydney in October 1791. From November 1791 until March 1793 he served in command on Norfolk Island.

The most common type refutes and relativizes claims made in the conspiracy theories or by the conspiracy theorists and points out that the theories are detached from Israeli political culture, social relations and historic events. This criticism is not necessarily politically \"coloured\" and may refer to both the right wing and left wing conspiracy theories. The other criticism focuses entirely on the more common, right wing theories.\n\nA second, mostly Israeli left-wing criticism, attacks the very existence of such theories as a denial of what they consider to be right wing \"responsibility\" for the murder.This \"responsibility\" for the murder would have been by creating an extreme hostile environment to the late Prime Minister, in which Yigal Amir and his immediate accomplices Hagai Amir and Dror Adani were just a small group of the actors.\n\nA third type of criticism, by right-wing activists, claims that the mostly Israeli right-wing conspiracy supporters embarrass the Israeli right by supporting fringe theories for which no proof exists.

It is a hypothetical explanation for evolution and development of organisms, which Bergson linked closely with consciousness – with the intuitive perception of experience and the flow of inner time.\n\nDistant anticipations of Bergson can be found in the work of the pre-Christian Stoic philosopher Posidonius, who postulated a \"vital force\" emanated by the sun to all living creatures on the Earth's surface, and in that of Zeno of Elea. The concept of \"élan vital\" is also similar to Arthur Schopenhauer's concept of the will-to-live.\n\nIt was believed by some that this essence (\"élan vital\") could be harvested and embedded into an inanimate substance and activated with electricity, perhaps taking literally another of Bergson's metaphorical descriptions, the \"current of life\".\n\nThe French philosopher Gilles Deleuze attempted to recoup the novelty of Bergson's idea in his book \"Bergsonism\", though the term itself underwent substantial changes by Deleuze. No longer considered a mystical, elusive force acting on brute matter, as it was in the vitalist debates of the late 19th century, \"élan vital\" in Deleuze's hands denotes an internal force, a substance in which the distinction between organic and inorganic matter is indiscernible, and the emergence of life undecidable.\n\nThe notion of \"élan vital\" also had considerable influence on the psychiatrist and phenomenologist Eugène Minkowski and his own concept of a \"personal élan\" – the element which keeps us in touch with a feeling of life (and is lost in autism).\n\nThe French army incorporated the doctrine of \"élan vital\" into its thinking during the leadup to the First World War by arguing that the spirit of individual soldiers was more important for victory than weapons.\n\n"}
