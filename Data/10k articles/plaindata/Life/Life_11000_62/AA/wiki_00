He had served with distinction on campaign in al-Andalus, was appointed governor of Málaga in 1202, and \"sheikh\" of the Masmuda tribe of the Haskura in 1206. He served for some time after that as governor in Sijilmassa, and around 1221, was briefly governor in Seville.\n\nAbd al-Wahid was back in Marrakesh in February 1224, when his grand-nephew, the young Almohad caliph Yusuf II, was accidentally killed, leaving no heirs. The palace vizier Abu Sa`id Uthman ibn Jam`i quickly drafted the elderly Abd al-Wahid, then in his sixties, and presented him before the Almohad sheikhs of Marrakesh, who promptly elected him as the new Almohad Caliph. However, the hastiness of the election and the probable unconstitutionality of these proceedings, was disputed by his other nephews, the brothers of al-Nasir, who governed in al-Andalus. Like other leading Almohad family nobles, the brothers had probably hoped for a less-experienced and more pliable candidate, likelier to give them freer rein to carry on autonomously in the provinces, as they had enjoyed during the caliphate of Yusuf II. The succession stunt unbalanced the careful coalition that had been built up over decades, setting different branches of the Almohad family member against each other, and against the palace bureaucrats and the tribal sheikhs.\n\nIt was the first serious succession dispute in the Almohad Caliphate. Despite disagreements, the Almohad coalition had hitherto loyally lined up behind the new caliph. Not this time. Instigated by the shadowy figure of Abu Zayd ibn Yujjan, a former high bureaucrat who been disgraced and exiled by al-Jami'i, the brothers decided to elect their own Caliph Abdallah al-Adil in Seville, and set about ferrying troops from Spain to challenge Abd al-Wahid I in Morocco.\n\nThe new caliphate did not last long. Ibn Yujjan pulled on his old contacts in southern Morocco, notably Abu Zakariya, the sheikh of the Hintata tribe, and Yusuf ibn Ali, governor of Tinmal, who seized the Marrkesh palace and cleared out Ibn Jami'i and his coterie (Ibn Jami'i was eventually killed, while in exile in the Atlas. The caliph himself, Abd al-Wahid I, was murdered by strangulation in September 1224. The nickname by which he is frequently referred to in the chronicles, \"al-Makhlu\", means \"the Deposed\".\n\n"}

Among his brothers were the following.\n\nHis wives and children included the following.\n\n\nHe was a wealthy merchant.

The dispute became so severe that for four or five days, all work on the rebuilding ceased. Abu Umayya played a key role in settling the dispute by suggesting that the next man to enter the gate should be appointed umpire. The Quraysh agreed to this. As it happened, the next man to walk in was the future prophet Muhammad. The Quraysh were pleased, saying, \"This is the Trustworthy One. We are satisfied. This is Muhammad.\" He settled the dispute by placing the Black Stone on a cloak. Representatives from each clan took one corner, and they lifted the cloak together.

Studies have shown that the use of some antidepressants correlate with an increased risk of suicide in some patients, and this problem has been serious enough to warrant government interventions in some places to label greater likelihood of suicide as a risk of using antidepressants. The circumstances under which this can happen are not clear, and other studies show that antidepressants treat suicidal ideation.\n\nPeople under the age of 24 who suffer from depression are warned that the use of antidepressants could increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. Federal health officials unveiled proposed changes to the labels on antidepressant drugs in December 2006 to warn people of this danger.\n\nThe FDA warns against the use of Paxil for children and teens depression in favor of Prozac.\n\nSSRI prescriptions for children and adolescents decreased after U.S. and European regulatory agencies issued warnings about a possible suicide risk with antidepressant use in pediatric patients, and these decreases were associated with increases in suicide rates in children and adolescents in both the United States with a 14% increase, and 50% increase in the Netherlands.\n\nA 2016 review of 70 clinical trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) including about 18,500 subjects and relied on clinical reports as well as the available data looked at four outcomes—death, suicidality, aggressive behaviour, and agitation—and found that while the data was insufficient to draw strong conclusions, adults taking these drugs did not appear to be at increased risk for any of the four outcomes, but that for children, the risks of suicidality and for aggression doubled. The authors expressed frustration with incomplete reporting and lack of access to data, and with some aspects of the clinical trial designs.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires \"black box warnings\" on all SSRIs, which state that they double suicidal ideation rates (from 2 in 1,000 to 4 in 1,000) in children and adolescents. It remains controversial whether increased risk of suicide is due to the medication (a paradoxical effect) or part of the depression itself (i.e. the antidepressant enables those who are severely depressed—who ordinarily would be paralyzed by their depression—to become more alert and act out suicidal urges before being fully recovered from their depressive episode). The increased risk for suicidality and suicidal behaviour among adults under 25 approaches that seen in children and adolescents.\nYoung patients should be closely monitored for signs of suicidal ideation or behaviors, especially in the first eight weeks of therapy.\nSertraline, tricyclic agents and venlafaxine were found to increase the risk of attempted suicide in severely depressed adolescents on Medicaid.\n\nA 2009 study showed increased risk of suicide after initiation, titration, and discontinuation of medication. A study of 159,810 users of either amitriptyline, fluoxetine, paroxetine or dothiepin found that the risk of suicidal behavior is increased in the first month after starting antidepressants, especially during the first 1 to 9 days.\n\nOn September 6, 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the suicide rate in American adolescents, (especially girls, 10 to 24 years old), increased 8% (2003 to 2004), the largest jump in 15 years, to 4,599 suicides in Americans ages 10 to 24 in 2004, from 4,232 in 2003, giving a suicide rate of 7.32 per 100,000 people that age. The rate previously dropped to 6.78 per 100,000 in 2003 from 9.48 per 100,000 in 1990. Jon Jureidini, a critic of this study, says that the US \"2004 suicide figures were compared simplistically with the previous year, rather than examining the change in trends over several years\". It has been noted that the pitfalls of such attempts to infer a trend using just two data points (years 2003 and 2004) are further demonstrated by the fact that, according to the new epidemiological data, the suicide rate in 2005 in children and adolescents actually declined despite the continuing decrease of SSRI prescriptions. \"It is risky to draw conclusions from limited ecologic analyses of isolated year-to-year fluctuations in antidepressant prescriptions and suicides.\n\nOne promising epidemiological approach involves examining the associations between trends in psychotropic medication use and suicide over time across a large number of small geographic regions. Until the results of more detailed analyses are known, prudence dictates deferring judgment concerning the public health effects of the FDA warnings.\" Subsequest follow-up studies have supported the hypothesis that antidepressant drugs reduce suicide risk.\n\nA study in 2012, involving the analysis of data from 41 clinical trials with more than 9,000 patients, concluded \"Fluoxetine and venlafaxine decreased suicidal thoughts and behavior for adult and geriatric patients. This protective effect is mediated by decreases in depressive symptoms with treatment. For youths, no significant effects of treatment on suicidal thoughts and behavior were found, although depression responded to treatment. No evidence of increased suicide risk was observed in youths receiving active medication\".\n\n\n\n"}

The group also includes one man who is known as the Arlington Gentleman.\n\nThe history of the group traces its existence to 1948, when Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force Hoyt Vandenberg, and his wife Gladys, witnessed young servicemembers being buried without any family members present on one of their walks through the cemetery. Just a chaplain and a military honor guard, the standard attendees, were usually present. The lack of anyone honoring the young airman being buried prompted Gladys to form a group of members of the Officers' Wives Club to attend all Air Force funerals. In 1972, the wife of Army Chief of Staff General Creighton Abrams, Julia, founded the Army's version of the group. In 1985, the Navy also followed suit by creating a group of their own. The Coast Guard Arlington Ladies group formed in 2006. The Marine Corps Arlington Ladies were established in 2016.\n\nOriginally, the women worked alone at the funerals. Escorts were eventually added as it was decided that they should appear to be a more official part of the ceremony. The escorts are also members of the Army's 3rd Infantry Regiment. The Army soldiers typically spend four months as escorts while the Navy men are permanently assigned and will spend their entire tours on assignment.\n\nThe group initially included military wives, but it now includes military daughters and even a gentleman. The Army Arlington ladies must be wives or widows of Army men and be referred by a current wife. The Navy and Air Force follow similar requirements for their ladies.\n"}
{"id": "53718284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53718284", "title": "Asfar ibn Shiruya", "text": "Asfar ibn Shiruya\n\nAsfar ibn Shiruya (Gilaki/: died 931) was an Iranian military leader of Gilaki origin, active in northern Iran (esp. Tabaristan and Jibal) in the early 10th century. He played a major role in the succession disputes of the Alids of Tabaristan, and managed to establish himself as the ruler of Tabaristan and northern Jibal briefly from 928 to 930.\n\n\"Asfār\" is a local Caspian form of Middle Persian \"aswār\", which means \"rider, cavalryman\". The New Persian form of the word is \"savār\".\n\nA native of Lahijan, Asfar belonged to the Gilaki clan of Varudavand, and was the son of a certain Shiruya (Sheroe). Asfar had a brother named Shirzad, and grew up in an environment where \"Iranian culture, memories of the glories of the Persian Empire, were alive among them.\" Like many other Gilakis and Daylamites, Asfar was not a Muslim—he was in fact a nationalist, who admired the Persian Empire. According to the 10th-century Arab historian al-Masudi, most of the Daylamite and Gilaki leaders, who were Zoroastrian and pagan, had become atheists. Asfar was one of the many Gilaki leaders that entered into the service of the Alids, after establishing their rule over Tabaristan, Gilan, and Daylam.\n\nAsfar is first mentioned in 917, during the succession disputes for control in Tabaristan after the death of the Alid ruler Hasan al-Utrush (r. 914–917). Eventually, Hasan ibn Qasam (called \"al-da'i al-saghir\", \"the lesser missionary\") managed to emerge victorious. It was around this period, that the Samanid Empire was seeking to expand their power from Transoxiana and Khorasan into northern Iran, opposing Zaydi Shia Islam there whilst advocating the Sunni movement against it.\n\nAsfar now expanded his domains over Ray, Qazvin and other parts of Jibal, initially apparently as a delegate of the Samanids, but thereafter as an sovereign ruler, assuming the emblem of kingship at Ray in disregard of Nasr II and the Abbasid caliph, al-Muqtadir (r. 908-932). He reportedly killed a great number of the citizens of Qazvin, burned the markets, demolished mosques and killed the \"muezzin\", and prohibited the \"salah\". Furthermore, he enforced a poll-tax on the whole population of the city, along with traders visiting from other countries, thus acquiring a vast sum. He also appointed his lieutenant and compatriot Mardavij as the governor of Zanjan. \n\nIn 930, Mardavij along with Asfar's brother, Shirzad, were ordered to capture Tarom, the capital of the Sallarid ruler Muhammad ibn Musafir. During the siege, Mardavij, on the urging of Makan and Muhammad, betrayed Asfar by revolting against him. With the aid of Muhammad and Makan, Mardavij defeated and killed Shirzad, including other members of the Varudavand clan. He then marched towards Qazvin, the residence of Asfar. However, Asfar managed to flee. Mardavij thus founded the Ziyarid dynasty, and became ruler of Asfar's former territories.\n\nAsfar was chased into Khorasan, being left no choice but to leave the treasure which he had assembled in the castle of Alamut in Daylam. When Asfar arrived at Bayhaq, however, he went back, aiming to recover his treasure at Alamut. But when he entered Talaqan, a town in Daylam near Qazvin, he was overwhelmed and killed by Mardavij, most likely in 931.\n\n"}

Ramsey is serving two 99-year prison sentences and will be eligible for parole in 2066 when he is 85.\n\nReports say in the two weeks prior to the incident, more than 15 students knew of Ramsey's intention to commit a school shooting, and two actually assisted him. One student named James Randall taught him how to load and fire a shotgun, and another named Matthew Charles told him of the infamy that would come. Reports say that several students brought cameras to school on the day of the shooting, and that many students were watching the shooting from a library balcony overlooking the student commons area.\n\nOn February 19, 1997, Ramsey armed himself with a Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun, and arrived at Bethel Regional High School by school bus. He approached the student commons area, brandishing the shotgun, and shot 15-year-old Josh Palacios in the abdomen, who later died after emergency surgery. He then shot and injured two other students. Reyne Athanas, an art teacher, entered the commons area after hearing the gunshots. Athanas said she tried and failed to convince Ramsey to surrender. He then entered the main lobby, where he shot principal Ron Edwards twice, killing him. Ramsey then retreated to the commons area, shooting once at police. Ramsey later placed the shotgun barrel under his chin, but then reportedly said, \"I don't want to die,\" laid the shotgun on the ground, and surrendered without further incident.\n\nRamsey was believed to be frequently bullied at school. According to his friends, Ramsey complained of being harassed and teased by other students, even to the extent of only addressing him as \"Screech\", a character from the TV series \"Saved by the Bell\". In addition to being picked on by peers, however, Ramsey had a long history of abuse. His mother lived with a series of violent men who abused Ramsey and his brothers. He also was physically and sexually abused by an older boy in one of the foster homes he was placed.\n\nEvan Ramsey (born February 8, 1981) was identified as the gunman. When he was five years old, his father was imprisoned after a police standoff and his mother became an alcoholic. Ramsey and his family soon after were forced to relocate to the Anchorage area after their house was set on fire. When he was seven, the Anchorage Department of Youth and Family Services removed Ramsey and his two brothers from his mother's custody and placed them in foster care. He was soon separated from his older brother, John, and lived in eleven different foster homes between 1988 and 1991. Ramsey and his younger brother were allegedly abused by several foster parents. His younger brother, William, claimed that their foster brothers would pay other children to beat Evan for their amusement.\n\nRamsey was adopted with his brother at age 10, and settled in Bethel, Alaska with their foster mother. Ramsey has suffered from depression since early childhood, and attempted suicide when he was 10 years old.\n\nRamsey was not the first in his family to bring a firearm into a public place. In October 1986, his father, Don Ramsey, went to the \"Anchorage Times\" newspaper office armed with an Armalite AR-18 rifle, a revolver, and more than 210 rounds of ammunition. While inside the building, Don Ramsey began taking hostages and was involved in a brief standoff with police until he surrendered. His motive for doing this was because he was angered that the \"Times\" refused to publish a political letter he had written. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and was paroled just several weeks before his son Evan perpetrated the school shooting. Also, a week before Evan's attack, his older brother was arrested for armed robbery.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Ramsey claimed he did not understand his actions would kill anyone. His trial was delayed as prosecutors discussed whether Ramsey should be tried as a juvenile or as an adult. Prosecutors decided to try Ramsey as an adult in Anchorage. On Dec. 2, 1998, Ramsey was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder, three counts of first-degree attempted murder, and fifteen counts of third-degree assault. Judge Mark Isaac Wood sentenced him to 210 years in prison; on appeal, however, his sentence was reduced to two 99-year prison sentences. He is imprisoned at the Spring Creek Correctional Center in Seward, and will be eligible for parole in 2066, when he will be 85 years old.\n\nOn February 15, 2006, Ramsey participated in an interview with Anderson Cooper titled \"In the Mind of a Killer\", in which his father Don Ramsey blamed the video game \"Doom\" for the shooting. His crime was also profiled on the Court TV series \"Anatomy of a Crime\". Ramsey's actions were also covered in the program \"Kids Who Kill\" which also featured interviews with Ramsey.\n\n"}

Between 2004 and 2014, NIH funding remained relatively flat and was not increased to keep pace with inflation. The NIH budget peaked at circa $35 billion per year from 2003 to 2005 and was around $30 billion in 2015.\n\nGovernment efforts to increase allocations to research between 2013 and 2016 were often thwarted by the congressional austerity drive, with Congress withholding approval of the federal government's budget several times. Over this period, the executive’s priorities were taken forward largely thanks to collaboration between the government, industry and the non-profit sector. This was particularly true for the health sector which, like climate change, was a priority for the Obama administration.\n\nA key policy objective of the Obama administration was to develop more targeted therapies while reducing the time and cost of drug development. Developing a new drug takes well over a decade and has a failure rate of more than 95%. The most expensive failures happen in late phase clinical trials. It is thus vital to pinpoint the right biological targets (genes, proteins and other molecules) early in the process, so as to design more rational drugs and better tailored therapies.\n\nThe 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law on 13 December 2016, a year after the release of the UNESCO Science Report. The report had predicted that, ‘were the bill to pass into law, it would alter the way in which clinical trials are conducted by allowing new and adaptive trial designs that factor in personalized parameters, such as biomarkers and genetics. This provision has proven controversial, with doctors cautioning that overreliance on biomarkers as a measure of efficacy can be misleading, as they may not always reflect improved patient outcomes'.\n\nAnother government scheme hopes to increase the number of new diagnostics and therapies for patients, while reducing the time and cost of developing these. At the launch of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in February 2014, NIH director Francis S. Collins stated that 'Currently, we are investing too much money and time in avenues that don't pan out, while patients and their families wait'. Over the five years to 2019, this public−private partnership is developing up to five pilot projects for three common but difficult-to-treat diseases: Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 (adult onset) diabetes and the autoimmune disorders of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.\n\nThe partnership involves the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as 10 major biopharmaceutical companies and several non-profit organizations like the Alzheimer's Association. The industrial partners are Abbvie (US), Biogen (US), Bristol-Myers Squibb (US), GlaxoSmithKline (UK), Johnson & Johnson (US), Lilly (US), Merck (US), Pfizer (US), Sanofi (France) and Takeda (Japan).\n\nLaboratories share samples, such as blood or brain tissue from deceased patients, to identify biomarkers. They also participate in NIH clinical trials. One critical component is that industry partners have agreed to make the data and analyses arising from the partnership accessible to the broad biomedical community. They will not use any discoveries to develop their own drug until these findings have been made public.\n\nIn April 2013, the government announced another public−private partnership, this time to implement its Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. The goal of this project is to leverage genetic, optical and imaging technologies to map individual neurons and complex circuits in the brain, eventually leading to a more complete understanding of this organ’s structure and function. By 2015, the BRAIN Initiative had ‘obtained commitments of over US$ 300 million in resources from federal agencies (National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, National Science Foundation, etc.), industry (National Photonics Initiative, General Electric, Google, GlaxoSmithKline, etc.) and philanthropy (foundations and universities)’.\n\nThe Precision Medicine Initiative has been another government priority. Defined as delivering the right treatment to the right patient at the right time, precision medicine tailors treatments to patients based on their unique physiology, biochemistry and genetics. In his 2016 budget request, the president asked for US$215 million to be shared by the NIH, National Cancer Institute and FDA to fund the Precision Medicine Initiative.\n\nIn 2013, US pharmaceutical companies spent $40 billion on R&D inside the US and nearly another $11 billion on R&D abroad.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2010, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies increased their investment in precision medicine by roughly 75% and a further increase of 53% is projected by 2015. Between 12% and 50% of the products in their drug development pipelines are related to personalized medicine. \n\nThe federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United States offer R&D tax credits to particular industries and companies. Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years. According to a survey by the \"Wall Street Journal\" in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making décisions about investing in R&D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.\n\nIn 2014, six US biopharmaceutical companies figured in the global Top 50 for the volume of expenditure on R&D. The following have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included for the first time in 2013 and Amazon in 2014, which is why the online store does not figure in the Top 50 for 2014.\n\nGlobal top 50 companies by R&D volume and intensity, 2014\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> R&D intensity is defined as R&D expenditure divided by net sales.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Although incorporated in the Netherlands, Airbus’s principal manufacturing facilities are located in France, Germany, Spain and the UK.\n\nSource: \"UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030\" (2015), Table 9.3, based on Hernández \"et. al\" (2014) \"EU R&D Scoreboard: the 2014 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard\". European Commission: Brussels, Table 2.2.\n\nThe National Venture Capital Association has reported that, in 2014, venture capital investment in the life sciences was at its highest level since 2008: in biotechnology, $6.0 billion was invested in 470 deals and, in life sciences overall, $8.6 billion in 789 deals (including biotechnology and medical devices). Two-thirds (68%) of the investment in biotechnology went to first-time/early-stage development deals and the remainder to the expansion stage of development (14%), seed-stage companies (11%) and late-stage companies (7%).\n\nHowever, it was the software industry which invested in the greatest number of deals overall: 1 799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1 005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the State of California, which alone concentrates 28% of US research.\n\nTotal investment in venture capital amounted to US$48.3 billion in 2014, for 4 356 deals. This represented ‘an increase of 61% in dollars and a 4% increase in deals over the prior year,’ reported the National Venture Capital Association.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that venture capital investment in the United States had fully recovered by 2014.\n\nIn recent years, a number of pharmaceutical companies have made strategic mergers to relocate their headquarters overseas to gain a tax advantage, including Medtronic and Endo International. Pfizer's own attempt to take over the British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca aborted in 2014 after Pfizer admitted plans to cut research spending in the combined company.\n\nOne policy concern for the Obama administration has been the steep rise in the price of prescription drugs, in a country where these prices are largely unregulated. From January 2008 to December 2014, the price of commonly used branded drugs increased by a little over 127%, even as the price of commonly prescribed generic drugs decreased by almost 63%.\n\nIn 2014, spending on prescription drugs hit $374 billion. This increase in spending was fuelled by the costly new drugs on the market for treating hepatitis C ($11 billion), rather than by the millions of newly insured Americans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 ($1 billion). About 31% of this spending went on specialty drug therapies to treat inflammatory conditions, multiple sclerosis, oncology, hepatitis C and HIV, etc., and 6.4% on traditional therapies to treat diabetes, high cholesterol, pain, high blood pressure and heart disease, asthma, depression and so on’.\n\nFuelling the 'astronomic' rise in consumer prices for prescription drugs has been a new trend in the US, the acquisition of pharmaceuticals through licensing, purchase, a merger or acquisition. In the first half of 2014, the value of mergers and acquisitions by pharmaceutical companies totalled US$317.4 billion and, in the first quarter of 2015, the drug industry accounted for a little more than 45% of all US mergers and acquisitions. Several pharmaceutical companies have made strategic mergers in recent years to relocate their headquarters overseas to order to gain a tax advantage. Pfizer’s own attempt to take over the British pharmaceutical company Astrazeneca aborted in 2014, after Pfizer admitted plans to cut research spending in the combined company.\n\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act was signed into law in March 2010 to encourage the development of generic drug competition as a cost containment measure for high-priced pharmaceuticals. Part of the government’s signatory Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it has created a pathway for fast-track licensure for biological products that are shown to be ‘biosimilar’ to, or ‘interchangeable’ with, an approved biological product. One inspiration for the act was that the patents for many biologic drugs will expire in the next decade.\n\nAlthough the act was passed in 2010, the first biosimilar was only approved in the US by the FDA in 2015: Zarxio, made by Sandoz. Zarxio is a biosimilar of the cancer drug Neupogen, which boosts the patient’s white blood cells to ward off infection. In September 2015, a US court ruled that the Neupogen brand manufacturer Amgen could not block Zarxio from being sold in the US. Neupogen costs about US$3 000 per chemotherapy cycle; Zarxio hit the US market on 3 September 2015 at a 15% discount.\n\nIn Europe, the same drug had been approved as early as 2008 and has been safely marketed there ever since. The lag in development of an approval pathway in the US has been criticized for impeding access to biological therapies.\n\nThe true cost savings from the use of biosimilars is difficult to assess. A 2014 study by the Rand Institute estimates a range of US$13–66 billion in savings over 2014–2024, depending upon the level of competition and FDA regulatory approval patterns.\n\nUnlike generics, biosimilars cannot be approved on the basis of minimal and inexpensive tests to prove bioequivalence. Since biological drugs are complex, heterogeneous products derived from living cells, they can only be shown to be highly similar to the appropriate reference product and therefore require demonstration that there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety and efficacy. The extent to which clinical trials are required will largely determine the cost of development.\n\nOrphan diseases affect fewer than 200 000 Americans each year. Since the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, over 400 drugs and biologic products for rare diseases have been designated by the Food and Drug Administration (as of 2015), 260 alone in 2013. In 2014, sales of the top 10 orphan drugs in the US amounted to US$18.32 billion; by 2020, orphan drugs sales worldwide are projected to account for 19% (US$ 28.16 billion) of the total US$ 176 billion in prescription drug spending.\n\nHowever, orphan drugs cost about 19.1 times more than non-orphan drugs (on an annual basis) in 2014, at an average annual cost per patient of US$ 137 782. Some are concerned that the incentives given to pharmaceutical companies to develop orphan drugs by the FDA’s orphan drug products programme is taking the companies’ attention away from developing drugs that will benefit more of the population.\n\nThere are more than 6500 medical device companies in the US, more than 80% of which have fewer than 50 employees. According to the US Department of Commerce, the market size of the medical device industry in the US is expected to reach US$ 133 billion by 2016. \n\nObservers foresee the further development and emergence of wearable health monitoring devices, telediagnosis and telemonitoring, robotics, biosensors, three-dimensional (3D) printing, new \"in vitro\" diagnostic tests and mobile apps that enable users to monitor their health and related behaviour better.\n\nUntil 2010, the United States of America was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals. Since 2011, it has become a net importer of these goods. The United States has lost its world leadership for high-tech goods. Even computing and communications equipment is now assembled in China and other emerging economies, with high-tech value-added components being produced elsewhere.\n\nThe United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products far exceed exports. However, the United States' technologically skilled workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the license or sale of these patents. Within the United States' scientific industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned with the licensing of intellectual property rights.\n\nWhen it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in 2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4 billion). \n\nHealth care in the United States\n\nScience policy in the United States\n\nScience and technology in the United States\n"}

Fuller moved as a small child to Salt Lake City, Utah, where he remained until 1956, when he and his family moved to El Paso, Texas. His father got a job at El Paso Natural Gas at that time. It was the same year that Elvis Presley became popular, and Bobby Fuller became mesmerized by the new rock and roll star. Fuller soon adopted the style of fellow Texan Buddy Holly, fronting a four-man combo and often using original material.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, he played in clubs and bars in El Paso, and he recorded on independent record labels in Texas with a constantly changing line-up. The only constant band members were Fuller and his younger brother, Randy Fuller (born on January 29, 1944, in Hobbs, New Mexico) on bass. Most of these independent releases (except two songs recorded at the studio of Norman Petty in Clovis), and an excursion to Yucca Records, also in New Mexico, were recorded in the Fullers' own home studio, with Fuller acting as the producer. He even built a primitive echo chamber in the back yard. The quality of the recordings, using a couple of microphones and a mixing board purchased from a local radio station, was so impressive that he offered the use of his \"studio\" to local acts for free so he could hone his production skills.\n\nFuller moved to Los Angeles in 1964 with his band The Bobby Fuller Four, and was signed to Mustang Records by producer Bob Keane, who was noted for discovering Ritchie Valens and producing many surf music groups. By this time, the group consisted of Fuller and his brother Randy on vocals/guitar and bass respectively, Jim Reese on guitar and DeWayne Quirico on drums; this was the lineup that recorded \"I Fought The Law\". (There are actually two versions of \"I Fought The Law\" by Fuller: the original hit was released as a 45-rpm single, and the re-recording was issued on an album. The arrangements are identical but the vocals by Fuller are slightly different.)\n\nAt a time when the British Invasion and folk rock were the dominant genres in rock, Fuller stuck to Buddy Holly's style of classic rock and roll with Tex Mex flourishes. His recordings, both covers and originals, also reveal the influences of Eddie Cochran, The Beatles, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and The Everly Brothers, as well as surf guitar. Less well known was Fuller's ability to emulate the reverb-laden surf guitar of Dick Dale and The Ventures. His first Top 40 hit was the self-penned \"Let Her Dance\". His second hit, \"I Fought the Law\", peaked at #9 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on March 12–19, 1966. The song was originally written and recorded by Sonny Curtis, who became a member of Buddy Holly's former group The Crickets after Holly's death. The group's third Top 40 single was a cover of Holly's \"Love's Made a Fool of You.\"\n\nWithin months of \"I Fought the Law\" becoming a top 10 hit, Fuller was found dead in an automobile parked outside his Hollywood apartment. The Los Angeles deputy medical examiner, Jerry Nelson, performed the autopsy. According to Dean Kuipers: \"The report states that Bobby's face, chest, and side were covered in \"petechial hemorrhages\" probably caused by gasoline vapors and the summer heat. He found no bruises, no broken bones, no cuts. No evidence of beating.\" Kuipers further explains that boxes for \"accident\" and \"suicide\" were checked, but next to the boxes were question marks. Despite the official cause of death, some commentators believe Fuller was murdered.\n\nErik Greene, a relative of Sam Cooke, has cited similarities in the deaths of Cooke and Fuller. Fuller bandmate Jim Reese suspected that Charles Manson played a role in Fuller's death, but never provided credible evidence. A sensationalist crime website has speculated that the Los Angeles Police Department may have been involved because of Fuller's connection to a Mafia-related woman.\n\nFuller was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles. His death was profiled in a segment of \"Unsolved Mysteries\".\n\nHis death was explored in the May 11, 2015 episode of the NPR program \"All Things Considered.\" The program references the book \"I Fought the Law: The Life and Strange Death of Bobby Fuller\", by Miriam Linna, with contributions by Randy Fuller. Sometime after the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" segment in question initially aired, the cause of Fuller's death was officially changed from \"suicide\" to \"accident.\"\n\nIn 2017, Chuck Prophet released the critically lauded album \"Bobby Fuller Died for Your Sins\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7774469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7774469", "title": "Charles Burnett (RAF officer)", "text": "Charles Burnett (RAF officer)\n\nAir Chief Marshal Sir Charles Stuart Burnett, (3 April 1882 – 9 April 1945) was a senior commander in the Royal Air Force during the first half of the 20th century. He was Air Officer Commanding Iraq Command during the early 1930s. During the Second World War, he served as Chief of the Air Staff of the Royal Australian Air Force.\n\nCharles Burnett was born in Browns Valley, Minnesota, United States on 3 April 1882. He was the second son of John Alexander Burnett and Charlotte Susan Burnett. John Burnett was originally from the Scottish village of Kemnay in Aberdeenshire.\n\nBurnett was educated at Bedford School in England. His younger brother was Robert Burnett who was later knighted and rose to the rank of admiral.\n\nIn 1899, Burnett enlisted as a private in the Imperial Yeomanry in order to fight in the Second Boer War. Burnett claimed to be 18 when he was in fact only 17. He was discharged in 1901 in order that he might take a commission and he was gazetted as a second lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry in October 1901. Burnett was then attached to the Imperial Yeomanry for the next three years. He temporarily held the rank of lieutenant from 26 April 1902 to 7 February 1903.\n\nOn 20 August 1904, Burnett was seconded to the West African Frontier Force. During the next five years Burnett saw action in Northern Nigeria, contracted blackwater fever, was promoted to lieutenant and was twice mentioned in despatches.\n\nBurnett resigned his commission in September 1909 and then entered business as a part-owner of a shop in Portuguese Guinea. He did not meet with particular success as a businessman and by 1911 was employed by the British diplomatic service as the assistant resident in Ilorin, Nigeria.\n\nWith the outbreak of hostilities in 1914, Burnett rejoined the British Army. After qualifying as a pilot in November 1914, he was commissioned as a lieutenant on 4 December 1914. Burnett married Sybil Pack-Beresford just six days before his first posting as a Royal Flying Corps wing adjutant, which brought a temporary promotion to captain. In May 1915, Burnett was posted as a flight commander on No. 17 Squadron where he flew BE2c from Gosport and then Egypt. He became a substantive captain on 1 October 1916.\n\nOn 2 April 1916, Burnett was promoted to temporary major and appointed Officer Commanding of No. 36 Squadron, which was stationed in Cramlington. In October the same year Burnett was sent to the Western Front as Officer Commanding No. 12 Squadron. During his tour as Officer Commanding No. 12 Squadron, Burnett was once again mentioned in despatches.\n\nWith a promotion to temporary lieutenant colonel on 8 October 1917, Burnett was granted command of the Flying Corps' Fifth Wing which was operating in Palestine. Following his wing's contribution to the British victory in the Battle of Jerusalem in December 1917, Burnett was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. He was also awarded the Egyptian Order of the Nile, Third Class, and in the 1919 King's Birthday Honours he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in recognition of his wartime service in Egypt.\n\nBy the close of the war, Burnett had transferred to the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF) and the next few years of his military career were to involve many changes of post. In 1919, Burnett was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general and appointed (again temporarily) as General Officer Commanding the RAF's Palestine Brigade. Later the same year, he accepted the offer of a permanent commission in the RAF with the rank of wing commander.\n\nIn April 1920, Burnett was given command of the RAF's Mesopotamian Wing and when the wing was upgraded to a group, he worked as a staff officer at the group's HQ. From February to October 1921, Burnett was a supernumerary, first at the HQ Middle East Area and then at No. 7 Group where he was sent pending his next posting. It was during this time that Burnett was promoted to group captain, although for some of the period he was on the half-pay list.\n\nBurnett took up command of No. 29 Group in October 1921 but this was a short-lived appointment. In April 1922, Burnett was posted as station commander of RAF Leuchars which was a training base at that time. Once again Burnett did not spend long in post. By December 1922, he was a supernumerary once more, this time at the RAF Depot. From 1923-early 1927, Burnett served as the Deputy Director of Operations and Intelligence at the Air Ministry. He was made a Companion of the Bath (CB) in the 1927 New Year Honours. Burnett was then posted as the Commandant of the Central Flying School where he served until January 1929.\n\nHaving just been promoted to air commodore, Burnett's next tour saw him return to Iraq as the Senior Air Staff Officer at the HQ of Iraq Command where he served for the next two years. In early 1931, he returned to the United Kingdom and he was appointed to the double-hatted position of Deputy Chief of the Air Staff and Director of Operations and Intelligence. Burnett was promoted air vice-marshal the following July and he remained in post for a little under a year and a half.\n\nIn November 1932, Burnett returned to Iraq once more, this time as the Air Officer Commanding Iraq Command which placed him in charge of all British forces in Iraq. During his time in command Burnett was involved in the suppression of several tribal incursions near Kuwait and during one such occasion Burnett was wounded.\n\nBurnett returned to Great Britain at the start of 1935 to take up command of the RAF's Inland Area. At the start of 1936, whilst Burnett was Air Officer Commanding Inland Area, he was promoted to air marshal and made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the New Year Honours list. Later that year the RAF's command structure underwent a major reorganization. One of the changes was the redesignation of Inland Area as Training Command and Burnett became the command's first Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief. The next three years placed great demands upon Burnett and his command; as the threat from the German \"Luftwaffe\" increased, Training Command played a key role in the expansion of the RAF.\n\nIn July 1939, just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, Burnett was appointed an additional Inspector-General of the RAF and in August he was a member of British military mission to the Soviet Union.\n\nBurnett continued in his role as Inspector-General of the RAF until 1940 when he was appointed Chief of the Air Staff of the Royal Australian Air Force. Burnett's appointment to the senior post in the RAAF was not without controversy. Apart from the fact that by 1940 Burnett was due for retirement and his health was not at its best, the choice of a British officer over an Australian one caused open resentment in many quarters of the RAAF. The Australian prime minister, Robert Menzies, had decided that a British officer should head the RAAF, believing that Australian officers lacked the necessary experience. After discussions between the British and Australian governments, Burnett was selected and given an acting promotion to air chief marshal, a rank he subsequently retained.\n\nThe vexed question of Australia's role in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS) had led to the resignation of Air Vice-Marshal Stanley Goble, the previous substantive RAAF Chief of the Air Staff. Unlike Goble and several other senior RAAF commanders, Burnett believed that his most important task was to implement EATS to the full and thereby increase Australia's ability to provide aircrew to the RAF. Under Burnett the RAAF expanded from a strength of 3,489 men just prior to the outbreak of war to 79,074 in May 1942. Of the approximately 80,000 personnel in the RAAF when Burnett was replaced, 42 per cent were EATS personnel.\n\nBurnett also strove to increase the number of aircraft in the RAAF, although in this regard he was less successful than he was with increasing aircrew numbers. Under Burnett, RAAF units were placed in forward positions and priority was given to the aerial protection of Australian sea lanes. He also took a key role in the establishments of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) and RAAF health services, the latter having previously been provided by the Australian Army.\n\nFrom October 1941, Burnett had a strained working relationship with Arthur Drakeford, the Australian Labor Party's minister for air who had just then been appointed. Burnett and Drakeford frequently clashed and when in early 1942 Burnett proposed sweeping organizational changes, including the abolition of the Australian Air Board, a breaking point was reached. It had also been widely argued that Burnett's focus on the European theatre resulted in the RAAF lacking sufficient defensive strength and by 1942 the threat of invasion by Japan was growing. Burnett was replaced in May 1942 by an Australian, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, who succeeded to the position despite Burnett's lobbying for his deputy, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, to take over.\n\nBurnett retired from the RAF shortly after his return to Britain, but in 1943 he worked full-time in the RAF's cadet organisation, the Air Training Corps, as the commandant of the ATC's Central Command. In this role, Burnett was responsible for ATC squadrons in Hertfordshire, Middlesex, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Bedfordshire. By 1945 Burnett remained as commandant but his health was declining and on 9 April 1945 he died of a coronary thrombosis at the Princess Mary Hospital at RAF Halton. Charles Burnett was survived by his wife and four daughters.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "310284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=310284", "title": "Dance of Death (album)", "text": "Dance of Death (album)\n\nDance of Death is the thirteenth studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released first in Japan on 2 September and then 8 September 2003 in the rest of the world excluding North America (where it was released a day later). The album was recorded on magnetic (analogue) tape.\n\nTheir second studio release since the return of vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the album features the band's first-ever fully acoustic track, \"Journeyman\", as well as \"New Frontier\", their only song co-written by drummer Nicko McBrain. As with \"Brave New World\", its predecessor in 2000, the record was produced by Kevin Shirley, who has worked with Iron Maiden on all subsequent releases.\n\nThe band first confirmed that they would be working on a follow-up to 2000's \"Brave New World\" with producer Kevin Shirley on 27 November 2002, announced alongside a small set of European tour dates for the following year. On 6 January 2003, Shirley confirmed via his website that the band would begin recording that month, followed by the announcement that the basic tracks had been completed on 5 February and that the release was to be mixed in April. On 31 May, the band announced that the album, recorded at Sarm West Studios, would be entitled \"Dance of Death\", after which the release date was issued on 17 June.\n\nThe band undertook the Dance of Death World Tour in support of the album, which included many theatrical elements inspired by the record's songs. During \"Dance of Death\", Bruce Dickinson would wear theatrical masks and a cape while moving around the stage; at the end he would dress as the Grim Reaper for the final chorus. During \"Paschendale\", Dickinson would wear a traditional British Infantryman trench coat and helmet (although he revealed in the \"Death on the Road\" documentary that it was actually Hungarian), as worn during World War I, and the set would be decorated with barbed wire. The tour led to a live album and DVD, entitled \"Death on the Road\", released in 2005 and 2006.\n\nThe computer-generated cover art was provided by David Patchett, who allegedly asked for his name to be removed from the album's credits after the band decided to use an unfinished version, which was received negatively. Dickinson later called the cover \"embarrassing\".\n\nThe album was released as a DVD-Audio disc in 2004, including 5.1 mixes of each song.\n\n\"Dance of Death\" is the only Iron Maiden album to date in which drummer Nicko McBrain has a songwriting credit, having co-written \"New Frontier\". As a born-again Christian, the track expresses his concerns with human cloning, stating, \"I personally believe that God created man and it's only God's right to create a human being because only He can give you a soul. When man attempts to make man then it's a monster in a test tube.\" This also makes it the only Iron Maiden album to date in which every member of the band receives a songwriting credit.\n\n\"Montségur\" was based on the fall of the Cathar stronghold of the same name, which fell in the aftermath of the Albigensian Crusade in 1244. Dickinson, who wrote the song's lyrics, states, \"There is so much great stuff and so many great stories throughout history that you can make parallels with the modern day – particularly when history repeats itself as often as it does – that it makes for some very colourful subject matter.\"\n\n\"Paschendale\" is about the Battle of Passchendaele which took place during the First World War. It was written by Adrian Smith, who usually contributes to the band's shorter, more commercial-sounding songs, but decided to write what he describes as \"a traditional Maiden epic\". It features strong progressive rock elements, including its length, detailed structure, and multiple tempo changes throughout the song. Dickinson comments, \"the beauty of 'Paschendale' isn't in the epic-ness of the song – although you have to admit it is a powerful and stirring body of music – but the detail.\" In live performances, Dickinson introduces the song with a passage from Wilfred Owen's \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\".\n\nAccording to guitarist Janick Gers, the album's title track was inspired by the final scene of Ingmar Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal\", at the end of which \"these figures on the horizon start doing a little jig, which is the dance of death\". Gers wrote most of the music and explained the concept to Steve Harris, who wrote the lyrics and most of the melodies.\n\n\"Face in the Sand\" is based on the media coverage surrounding the Iraq War, taking place as the album was being recorded. Dickinson explains, \"I remember thinking about the desert sands as an image and how it moves and shifts with time. Specifically what I was thinking was that whatever empires you tend to build – whether they are British, American, Iraqi or whatever, they'll all crumble and fade away into something else. So, to my mind at least, the best thing you can hope for, if you were to leave anything behind, is just an imprint in the sand.\" The song is notable for being the first and only Iron Maiden track in which McBrain uses a double bass pedal.\n\nThe final track, \"Journeyman\", is Iron Maiden's first and only fully acoustic song. According to Dickinson on the \"Death on the Road\" live album, it is about \"the whole process of writing and being a musician\", although Mick Wall describes it as \"a wistful tale of \"carpe diem\"\". The song was originally recorded with electric instruments, however, as Dickinson states, \"after all the battering that we've given the listener over the last hour of music it just seemed right to play out with something totally unexpected and left field.\" The original version appears on the \"No More Lies\" EP.\n\nReviews for the album were generally positive with \"Kerrang!\" describing it as \"stupendous stuff and concrete proof that Maiden are as electrifying and important as they have been in a long time\". Sputnikmusic were also positive about the album, giving special mention to \"Paschendale\", described as \"quite easily the ultimate Maiden masterpiece\". Although deeming the first three songs \"refreshing yet unremarkable\", AllMusic describes \"Dance of Death\" as \"a triumphant return to form for these heavy metal legends.\"\n\nAlthough criticising the album for its length and for not \"matching the quality\" of its predecessor, \"Brave New World\", PopMatters praised the band for being able to \"still easily outclass most of the younger nu-metal bands today\".\n\nProduction and performance credits are adapted from the album liner notes.\n"}

In his long political career, he was Minister of Public Works, president of his Christian Democratic Party, senator, President of the Senate, and the 28th president of Chile from 1964 to 1970. His eldest son, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, also became president of Chile (1994–2000).\n\nFrei's Christian Democratic Party supported the Armed Forces intervention to remove his successor Salvador Allende from office in 1973, after the Chamber of Deputies, on August 22, 1973, accused Allende of violating the Constitution and called for his overthrow. He was later a vocal opponent of the Augusto Pinochet regime.\n\nEduardo Frei Montalva was born in Santiago on January 16, 1911, the son of Eduard Frei Schlinz, a Swiss-born ethnic German from Austria, and Victoria Montalva Martínez. In 1914, his family moved to , where his father had been hired as an accountant at a winery. In addition, his other two siblings, Arturo and Irene, were born. He attended the Escuela Pública de Lontué (Public School of Lontué).\n\nIn 1919 the family returned to Santiago and Eduardo, as a young man, entered the boarding school Seminario Conciliar de Santiago where he remained until 1922. In 1923, he entered Instituto de Humanidades Luis Campino, where he graduated in 1928, at the age of 17.\n\nAs an 18-year-old, he entered Universidad Católica School of Law in 1929. For two years, he had been visiting María, the sister of his friend, Alfredo Ruiz-Tagle. He attended high school and went on to study law, graduating as a lawyer in 1933. He married María Ruiz-Tagle with whom he had 7 children. His eldest son, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, was President of Chile from 1994 to 2000.\n\nHe began his political career in the Conservative Party, but was among a group of young men who founded their own party in 1938: the Falange Nacional. He was minister of Public Works in 1945, and in 1949, Frei was elected senator for Atacama and Coquimbo. The same year he published “Historia de los Partidos Políticos Chilenos” (“History of Chilean Political Parties”) in collaboration with Albert Edwards Vives. In 1950, he traveled to New York as a UN delegate. In 1952, at 41 years of age, Frei Montalva announced his first candidacy in the presidential elections.\n\nThe 1952 election was won by Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. Later, President Ibañez requested Frei to organize an executive committee. However, this never came to be. In 1954, the UN appointed him President of the Commission in charge of elaborating the report of the Conference of Chancellors held in Rio de Janeiro. Some of its members were: Carlos Lleras Restrepo, former President of Colombia, and Raúl Prebisch director of ECLAC. The report served as a basis for subsequent studies on economic development and the integration of Latin America. In 1956 he was elected Senator in Santiago by first majority.\n\nOn July 27, 1957, the Falange Nacional became the Christian Democratic Party of Chile, and he became the undisputed leader. Frei Montalva was offered once more the candidacy for president of the Republic in the 1958 elections. Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez was elected president while Eduardo Frei Montalva took only third place.\n\nDuring these years he published three more books: “Sentido y Forma de una Política” (“Meaning and Shape of Politics”), “La Verdad Tiene Su Hora” (“Truth Has Its Time”), y “Pensamiento y Acción” (“Thought and Action”). In 1960, he lectured at conference “The Mission of Universities in Latin America” in Montevideo; a widely promoted conference at that time. In 1961, he was elected President of the First World Christian Democratic Party Congress, held in Santiago, Chile. The congress was attended by delegations from throughout Latin America, European, North American, and African countries. That year he was invited as special guest to a seminar on the problems of Developing Nations, held at Oxford University. The seminar was attended by delegates from all over the world.\n\nBetween 1960-62, he lectured at Columbia University on problems in Latin America. In 1962, he gave a conference at Notre Dame University on the development and the integration of Latin American countries. He ran for president again in 1964. Declassified documents show that from 1962 through 1964, the CIA spent a total of $2.6 million to finance his presidential campaign and spent $3 million in anti-Allende propaganda \"to scare voters away from Allende's FRAP coalition\". The CIA considered its role in the victory of Frei a great success. \n\nThat year he was elected with his \"Revolución en Libertad\" (\"Revolution in Liberty\") slogan by a large margin (56%), defeating Socialist candidate Salvador Allende who only received 39% of the vote, but who subsequently won the 1970 Chilean presidential election.\n\nFrei's administration began many reforms in Chilean society. \"Promoción Popular\" (Social Promotion), \"Reforma Agraria\" (Agrarian Reform), \"Reforma Educacional\" (Education Reform), and \"Juntas de Vecinos\" (Neighborhood Associations) were some of his main projects. He also took measures to rationalize drug supply. On September 4, 1964, having one of the highest turnouts in Chilean history, Frei Montalva was elected President of the Republic of Chile. He took office two months later, on November 4.\n\nThe Frei presidency did much to tackle poverty, as characterised by the growing share of wages as a proportion of GNP. By the end of the Frei presidency, the wage and salaried sector received close to 51% of GNP, compared with 42% at the end of the Alessandri presidency. This positive redistribution of wealth was encouraged by government policies, particularly in the rural sector, where wages rose by 40% in real terms. Between 1964-70, total enrollment in education increased by 46%, while around 250,000 houses were built, mostly for the poor.\n\nFrei's administration also introduced a wealth tax and carried out a property tax reassessment in order to make the taxation system more progressive. Taxes as a percentage of GNP increased 12.8% in 1964 to 21.2% in 1970. The social reforms introduced by Frei's government led to a huge increase in public expenditure, which rose as a proportion of GNP from 35.7% in 1965 to 46.9% in 1970. Expenditures on education, agriculture, and housing rose went up considerably, with spending on housing increasing by 70% in real terms in 1965 alone. \n\nDuring Frei's six years in office, an average of 40,000 housing units were constructed each year, and a total of 100,000 lots were assigned. Investments in primary care clinics and hospitals were also carried out, with 20 clinics and 16 hospitals built between 1965 and 1969.\n\nIn 1965, he started a presidential tour through France, the United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy and the Vatican. During this time, he also visited countries in Latin America such as: Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela; places where he delivered important speeches on international issues.\n\nOn his return, he initiated important plans involving housing, education, reforestation, land reform, health, and the nationalization of copper. The Comisión Nacional de Cultura (National Culture Commission), the Consejería Nacional de la Promoción Popular and the Juntas de Vecinos (“Neighborhood Committees”) were also created.\n\nOne area of reform given high priority by the Frei Administration was the fostering of networks of local, self-help organisations (especially among the “unorganised” residents of the shantytowns), which was placed under a national supervisory council. As a result of the government's actions, mothers' centres, sports associations, youth clubs, residents’ committees, and parents' groups proliferated, with an estimated 20,000 units of this type in existence by 1970, according to government figures. Half of these new units were mothers' centres, with an estimated membership of 45,000 women, and the government claimed to have distributed 70,000 sewing machines to these centres. According to Frei, these measures had given “a new form of life and hope” to hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nImprovements were also made in areas such as housing, education and medical care. Between 1964-70, around 260,000 houses were constructed (around a third by the state housing corporation CORVI) and about 200,000 housing solutions were claimed (referring to the provision of sites for self-help housing projects). The number of hospitals (and beds) doubled under the PDC, and spending on education as a proportion of public expenditure rose from one-seventh to one-fifth. Around 3,000 new schools were built throughout the country, and by 1970 95% of children in the relevant age group were covered by primary education. Expenditure on scholarships and school loans was doubled, and school enrollment was raised from 1.8 million to 2.9 million. \n\nExpenditure on education doubled, the number of years of basic education was increased from six to eight, and a two-shift school-day was introduced that doubled the capacity of the country’s system. Frei's initiatives in education led to increased rates of enrollment in both primary and secondary education, with primary school coverage reaching 90% in the majority of rural and urban areas by 1970, while secondary school coverage reached 49% in 1970, compared with 18% at the start of the Sixties.\n\nA new law establishing work-accident and occupational disease insurance was signed into law in January 1968, providing for compulsory coverage of all salaried employees and wage earners, including apprentices and domestic servants. In March that year, a piece of legislation creating government-sponsored health insurance for public and private salaried employees and their dependents was signed into law. \n\nBasic health services were expanded with the training of community health workers, the building of rural health clinics, and the shifting of financial and personnel resources from hospitals to community health centres. These efforts contributed to a steep decline in infant mortality in Chile during the Sixties and Seventies.\n\nMuch attention was also given to improve social and economic conditions in the countryside. Both rural unionisation and agrarian reform were accelerated, with the government starting to expropriate estates in a serious way. Family allowance for farmers was doubled, the agricultural minimum wage was raised to the same level as its urban equivalent, and an agrarian reform law signed by Frei in July 1967 made all farms of more than eighty “basic” hectares liable to expropriation. The Frei Administration had thus made a major start to land reform, a policy continued by the Allende Government. \n\nThe agrarian reform carried out by the Frei Government organized the reformed sector according to a temporary system established in the law, whereby the expropriated estates became asentamientos. This was a legal form in which the farm operated as a joint enterprise between the state and the peasants who had lived in the former latifundia (extensive agricultural estates), with the state providing the credits, land, and technical assistance, and the peasants their labor. After an indeterminate period, the land would be made available for subdivision into small private plots, if the peasants wished. According to one study, the percentage of the population living below the poverty line steadily fell; from 39% in 1965 to 17% in 1970.\n\nDuring his administration 8 workers were killed in El Salvador mine and 11 squatters in the Massacre of Puerto Montt. His Minister of the Interior, Edmundo Pérez Zujovic was politically blamed for the deaths. On 21 October 1969 the Tacnazo insurrection, occurred—a brief non-violent demonstration of the Tacna artillery regiment in Santiago, led by General Roberto Viaux. \n\nIn 1966, the Andean Group, officially created through its Declaration, signed in January 1965. However, the group culminated with the famous speech delivered by Frei Montalva in Plaza Bolívar, Bogota. The same year the pacts on Chilean copper were signed.\n\nIn January 1967 the National Congress refused his constitutional permission to travel to the United States where he had been invited by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In April 1967, he participated in the Meeting of Presidents from American countries, carried out in Montevideo, Uruguay. \n\nIn 1970, he was awarded with the Doctor Honoris Causa title by the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. On November 4, he left office, handing over the Presidency to Salvador Allende.\n\nAfter Allende's 1970 victory, Frei became convinced of what he called a \"totalitarian project\" to impose a Communist tyranny. In 1971, he gave conferences at universities in Dayton, Ohio, Boston, and the Council of the Americas in New York, denouncing in all of them the actions of the Allende government that were violating the Constitution and the laws of Chile.\n\nIn the March 1973 parliamentary elections he was elected Senator for Santiago by a first majority. He was afterwards elected President of the Senate and became the leader of the opposition to Allende. On July 6, 1973, he met with the executive directors of the industrialists’ association (SOFOFA). They told Frei that the country was disintegrating and that if urgent measures were not taken, Chile would fall under a bloody Cuban-style Marxist dictatorship. Frei responded: \"There is nothing that can be done by myself, by the Congress, or by any civilian. Unfortunately, this problem can only be fixed with guns.\" Instead of going to the Congress, we should go to the regiments. \"I fully share your apprehensions, and I advise you to state them plainly to commanders-in-chief of the Armed Forces, hopefully today.\"\n\nOn September 11, 1973, during the coup d’etát President Salvador Allende died, most likely by committing suicide, in the presidential palace, La Moneda, as the Armed Forces seized power. His Christian Democratic Party supported the Armed Forces intervention to remove Allende from office in 1973, after the Chamber of Deputies, on August 22, 1973, accused Allende of violating the Constitution.\n\nIn November 1973 Frei wrote a historic letter to Mariano Rumor, President of the International Christian Democrats, endorsing the Armed Forces intervention and denouncing what he alleged was an attempt by Allende to impose a Communist dictatorship in Chile.\n\nBetween 1973-77, Frei Montalva was invited to different countries and participated in conferences, such as the Atlantic Conference in 1976. In 1975 he published his book “El Mandato de la Historia y las Exigencias del Porvenir” (“The Mandate of History and Demands of the Future“), and in 1977 his quintessential book “América Latina: Opción y Esperanza” (“Latin America: Option and Hope”) which has been translated into several languages.\n\nIn the period between 1977-82, he was invited to participate in the Brandt Commission, led by Willy Brandt. As a member, he attended meetings held in Germany, Switzerland, Mali, United States, Malaysia, France, Austria, Belgium, and Great Britain. As a Brandt Commission delegate he engaged with important executives from IDB, OAS, and ECLAC.\n\nIn 1980, he participated in the Meeting of Former Democrat Presidents of Latin America held in Caracas, Venezuela. In 1981, he was invited to the Club of Rome International Conference on the “Alternatives for Humanity: Latin America Mission” also held in Caracas. His last book “El Mensaje Humanista” (“The Humanist Message”) was published.\n\nLater, Frei became an opponent of Pinochet's military government. He opposed the extension of Pinochet's presidency in 1981, leading a rally against it.\n\nIn 1981 Frei was suffering from chronic acid reflux, stemming from a hiatal hernia, an unpleasant but not life-threatening condition. He was operated on for it, but died in Santiago on January 22, 1982, six days after turning 71. His death at the time was attributed to septicaemia stemming from surgery. He was buried in the Cementerio General de Santiago.\n\nIt was later alleged that Frei had been poisoned by the DINA, the intelligence service of the military government, with a toxin produced by biochemist Eugenio Berrios. After researchers from the University of Ghent, Belgium were reported to have found mustard gas in Frei's body, the former president's family filed a lawsuit, which was pending . \n\nFrei's personal doctor, Patricio Rojas, who was also his Minister of the Interior, denied the accusations. \"El Mercurio\" columnist Hermógenes Pérez de Arce disputes even the existence of the Belgian report, citing the denial by the University's chief of communications, Tom de Smedt, that an investigation had been done in that university. Tissue samples sent to FBI labs and to the labs at the University of Ghent showed no evidence of toxic substances. A Chilean doctor reportedly found residues of sulfonic salts which can be the result of the decomposition of mustard gas but can also be the result of the decomposition of a corpse.\n\nIn December 2009 six persons were arrested for their roles in the alleged assassination. \n\nJudge Alejandro Madrid based his decision on a report that determined that low doses of thallium and mustard gas were administered to Frei over an extended period while he was hospitalized at the Santa María Clinic in Santiago, and that these toxic substances had the effect of decreasing Frei's immune system, making him too weak to survive his surgery. \n\nThe report was widely criticized and by the surgical team on El Mercurio and La Segundo, newspapers owned by the Edwards family, which had brokered the coup and maintains strong ties to the CIA and to Pinochet's government. The Appeals Court suspended Judge Madrid from the case, and the accused were freed on bail.\n\nThe case was re-opened in 2010 after a failed attempt to disqualify Judge Madrid. \n\nIn April 2013, the body of poet Pablo Neruda, who died in 1973 in the same hospital one day before departing for exile, was exhumed amid suspicions of foul play in his death.\n\n\n"}

Fin Fin was produced by Makoto Tezuka.\n\nFin Fin responds to the player's tone of voice and volume of the voice - one reviewer describing Fin Fin as a 'virtual mood ring'. 30,000 copies were sold in the first year in Japan.\n\nFin Fin is much like the popular Tamagotchi, but for a PC. If he is not fed or paid enough attention, he would sing a sad whistling song or sometimes fly away.\n\nThere are different versions of Fin Fin and each version has a limited number of worlds available. There was a 3-world version, a 4-world version, a 5-world version, and a 6-world version (which has all the worlds).\n\nThe game's main goal is to win Finfin's friendship. There are many ways to communicate with Finfin. The first way is to press the 1 to 5 keys, which make a sound that attracts Finfin. The second way is to use a special microphone called the Smartsensor and a whistle that come with the game. In the 3, 4 and 5 world versions, the player can record their own voice using the Finfin sound recorder that comes with the game and a microphone. Their voice then plays back when they press the 6 to 0 keys.\n\nThere was also a separate sensor unit that informed Fin Fin whether the player was sitting in front of the screen. The sensor didn't work in the German versions because of a faulty installation routine.\n\nFinfin - Finfin is the main character of the game. He is half dolphin and half bird. The player can watch him sing, fly, swim, play, 'talk' and interact with him in different ways in different locations.\n\nFinnina - Finfin's wife. She can be seen in the Secret Inlet, Rem River Bank, and the Nest (which is only available in the 6-world version).\n\nFinfin Junior - Finfin's kid. He can only be seen in the 6-world version, at the Nest, when Finnina lays an egg and it hatches. He flies away from the Nest after a month.\n\nVarious flora and fauna - There are various animals and plants in the Planet TEO. Some plants only appear at night, ans some only at day. Some animals are friendly to Finfin, while others want to eat him (but they never can).\n\nThe game includes natural weather, from sunny days to cloudy days, rain or even thunderstorms. However, snowfall does not occur in the game because the areas in the game are close to the equator and so the temperatures are constantly in the warm to mild range. In addition to the weather, there are also annual events such as shooting stars and lunar eclipses, and natural weather phenomena such as rainbows or northern lights. Some could happen on a specific day (for example, on August 30, a double lunar eclipse would occur in the sky at a certain time) or on many days in a year.\n\nThere are six places to visit in the game. The 3-world version was released in Germany, and then the 4-world version was released in Germany. The 5-world version was only released in the USA and the 6-world version was exclusive to Japan and China. However, one can download the 6-world version at EMGE's website below.\n\nThis place is available in all versions. This is the most famous and important place of the game. It is quite high and there is a wide view over the surrounding forests to the \"Ermes\" mountain. In the foreground, there is a straightened branch. A \"Yaika\" tree, twisted in itself, with hanging leaves (similar to a willow or a birch), can be seen behind the branch. A little further on the right, there are two palm-like trees.\n\nThe Amile Forest is FinFin's favourite place to be. Here he plays, eats and sleeps, and here one can observe him very well as he flies and practices his flying tricks, or sings. Here, the player can offer a \"Lemo\" berry by pressing the spacebar, which he accepts or rejects depending on whether he's hungry or not.\n\nThis place is available in the 5-world version and above. Here grow the colorful \"Lemo\" berries that FinFin often eats. The valley is surrounded by mountains, on which firs grow. The \"Lemo\" bushes, which always form new flowers and berries, grow in the middle of the valley. In the foreground is a hill with lots of plants, flowers that make music and two deciduous trees.\n\nFinFin visits the valley to satisfy his hunger for berries. Here one can observe the way he circles the bushes several times and looks for ripe berries. If he finds one, he plucks it while hovering around the bush to eat afterwards. The player can also beat the neuro-drum by pressing the spacebar. If FinFin is not present, some plants start to play. After a while, animals appear at the concert. As soon as FinFin appears, the plants stop the music and the animals disappear one by one.\n\nThis place is available in all versions. It is located on a small woodland, surrounded by tall trees. The trees look like coniferous trees, which bear golden-brown nuts, which can be seen sparkling in the wilderness on some nights. The shrubs, bushes and ferns on the clearing resemble jungle plants. On the floor of the clearing lies a hollow tree trunk and a large quantity of nuts or their shells.\n\nFinFin visits the forest to satisfy his hunger for \"Tsubu\" nuts. Here one can observe him shaking the nuts from the trees by flying through the treetops. Then he eats the nuts lying on the ground.\n\nThis place is available in all versions. It is a small side course of the Remse river, which runs in the jungle and ends there. Here you can see two opposite broader banks, surrounded by dense banks. Between the plants are laubless trees, whose branches point in a different direction after each visit. There is a tree at the back with a hole in the trunk, forming a small cave.\n\nFinFin comes to this bay to relax. Therefore, the player is recommended not to disturb him. However, the player can watch FinFin while swimming, playing and catching fish. If the player is lucky, FinFin's wife will also appear at this location for a brief moment.\n\nThis place is available in the 4-world version and above. In the foreground is a cave inside the water. In the background of the upper part of the place, one can see the opposite plant-rich bank.\n\nThis place is the only one that shows the underwater world of TEO, and only here can the player watch FinFin diving and hunting for fish. FinFin's wife rarely comes to this place. If both are present, the player can watch the two doing a short underwater dance.\n\nThis place is only available in the 6-world version. At the left part of the foreground is a bush of many different plants. In the center is the nest of FinFin and Finnina, which can be in one of three stages: construction, final or decayed. In the background is a narrow waterfall that ends in a small river. The place is surrounded by a forest of tall trees.\n\nIn this place, the player can observe the rearing of Finfin Junior by FinFin and his wife Finnina. By pressing the spacebar, a loud FinFin call will sound, which can cause various things. It is supposed to scare away an enemy named Gminfly (flying orca), if the latter has approached the nest too much. When the \"call\" is exercised, a certain plant is always frightened in the foreground, blooming in a jerky manner and changing its color. Over time, it calms down again and takes its old form. If the player presses it while FinFin is in the foreground, he will start to cry.\n\nAnimated Storybook: To Teo and Back with Jack\n\nIt's a short point-and-click game. In it, a man travels with a boy named Jack to the planet TEO to search for Finfin. Jack wants to bring Finfin back with him.\n\nTanTan TEO\n\nThis game was released in Japan and Korea. It's a music game. The player controls FinFin with two keys and has to keep a clock given by the game. In order to pass a level, the player has to reach a certain amount of correct key combinations.\n\nPlot: FinFin would like to participate in a music festival, but he must first improve his rhythm with the help of his friends.\n\nTEO64 (unpublished)\n\nTEO64 is an unpublished version for the Nintendo 64DD.\n\n"}

This model of spiking neurons was developed by mathematicians Antonio Galves and Eva Löcherbach. In the first article on the model, in 2013, they called it a model of a \"system with interacting stochastic chains with memory of variable length.\"\n\nSome inspirations of the Galves–Löcherbach model are the Frank Spitzer's interacting particle system and Jorma Rissanen's notion of stochastic chain with memory of variable length. Another work that influenced this model was Bruno Cessac's study on the leaky integrate-and-fire model, who himself was influenced by Hédi Soula. Galves and Löcherbach referred to the process that Cessac described as \"a version in a finite dimension\" of their own probabilistic model.\n\nPrior integrate-and-fire models with stochastic characteristics relied on including a noise to simulate stochasticity. The Galves–Löcherbach model distinguishes itself because it is inherently stochastic, incorporating probabilistic measures directly in the calculation of spikes. It is also a model that may be applied relatively easily, from a computational standpoint, with a good ratio between cost and efficiency. It remains a non-Markovian model, since the probability of a given neuronal spike depends on the accumulated activity of the system since the last spike.\n\nContributions to the model were made, considering the hydrodynamic limit of the interacting neuronal system, the long-range behavior and aspects pertaining to the process in the sense of predicting and classifying behaviors according to a fonction of parameters, and the generalization of the model to the continuous time.\n\nThe Galves–Löcherbach model was a cornerstone to the Research, Innocation and Dissemination Center for Neuromathematics.\n\nThe model considers a countable set of neurons formula_1 and models its evolution in discrete-time periods formula_2 with a stochastic chain formula_3, considering values in formula_4. More precisely, for each neuron formula_5 and time period formula_2, we define formula_7 if neuron formula_8 spikes in period formula_9, and conversely formula_10. The configuration of the set of neurons, in the time period formula_2, is therefore defined as formula_12. For each time period formula_2, we define a sigma-algebra formula_14, representing the history of the evolution of the activity of this set of neurons until the relevant time period formula_9. The dynamics of the activity of this set of neurons is defined as follows. Once the history formula_16 is given, neurons spike or not in the next time period formula_17 independently from one another, that is, for each finite subset formula_18 and any configuration formula_19 we have\n\nFurthermore, the probability that a given neuron formula_8 spikes in a time period formula_9, according to the probabilistic model, is described by the formula\n\nwhere formula_22 is synaptic weight that expresses the increase of membrane potential of neuron formula_8 because of neuron formula_24's spike, formula_25 is a function that models the leak of potential and formula_26 is the most recent period of neuron formula_8's spike before the given time period formula_9, considering the formula\n\nAt time formula_29 before formula_9, neuron formula_8 spikes, restoring the membrane potential to its initial value.\n\n"}

In addition to a person wearing a costume, the position is filled by an actual bulldog, the honor (and the title \"Handsome Dan\") being transferred to another upon death or retirement. \n\n1889–1897 (retired to England).<br>\nHandsome Dan was selected based on his ability to tolerate bands and children, negative reaction to the color crimson and to tigers (the symbols of rival schools Harvard and Princeton respectively), bought by Yale student Andrew Barbey Graves , who cleaned up the dog and named him “Handsome Dan.” Soon, Dan followed Graves everywhere around campus, including sporting events. The students quickly adopted Dan as the Yale mascot. After Graves graduated and returned to England, Dan stayed on campus with his master’s brother, William Leon Graves. Before football and baseball games would begin, Handsome Dan founded a tradition and a dynasty by being led across the field. One newspaper reported: \"He was a big white bulldog, with one of the greatest faces a dog of that breed (English) ever carried\". This was not an exaggeration, as Handsome Dan was one of the finest specimens of his breed in America, and went on to win first prize at the Westminster Dog Show and at least thirty other first prize ribbons in the United States and Canada. According to the Hartford Courant, \"In personal appearance, he seemed like a cross between an alligator and a horned frog, and he was called handsome by the metaphysicians under the law of compensation. The title came to him, he never sought it. He was always taken to games on a leash, and the Harvard football team for years owed its continued existence to the fact that the rope held.\" The Philadelphia Press reported that \"a favorite trick was to tell him to 'Speak to Harvard.' He would bark ferociously and work himself into physical contortions of rage never before dreamed of by a dog. Dan was peculiar to himself in one thing – he would never associate with anyone but students. Dan implanted himself more firmly in the hearts of Yale students than any mascot had ever done before.\" Handsome Dan crossed the Atlantic to join his old master in 1897 and died in 1898. Graves had Dan stuffed and returned him to be displayed at Yale in the old gymnasium. When it was torn down, Dan I was sent to the Peabody Museum for reconstruction. Handsome Dan I now is in a sealed glass case in one of the trophy rooms of Yale's Payne Whitney Gymnasium, where, according to Stanton Ford, \"he is the perpetual guardian of the treasures which attest to generations of Yale athletic glory.\" Andrew Graves died of tuberculosis on February 18, 1948, in Westbury, Long Island.\n\n1933–1937 (died of a broken leg).<br>\nAfter a 35-year interval, Handsome Dan II was purchased with pennies donated by the freshman class, and given to coach Ducky Pond. Handsome Dan II was kidnapped by Harvard students the day before the 1934 Harvard-Yale football game, and Yale students were alarmed at photographs of him happily seated at the foot of the statue of John Harvard in Harvard Yard, having a snack. He died of a leg fracture received from a jump. (Handsome Dan II now is in a sealed glass case in the Yale University Visitor's centre on Elm Street.)\n\n1937–1938 (retired due to emotional instability).<br>\nHandsome Dan III was a huge white dog who unfortunately exhibited morbid fear of crowds and had to be retired.\n\n1938–1940 (retired due to injury).<br>\nHandsome Dan IV had his spine fractured by a car early in his term of office, leaving his hind legs paralyzed. Until he eventually died in 1940, a bulldog named Bull served in his place, becoming Handsome Dan V.\n\n1940–1947 (died of old age).<br>\n\"Bull\", brought in his youth to watch football practices by his owner, high school student Bob Day who lived near the Yale Bowl, ascended to office when Handsome Dan IV died. A great success, he loved public appearances and the adulation of crowds, was a familiar figure around the locker rooms, and joined the team on a trip to Princeton University.\n\n1947–1949 (died mysteriously at age 2).<br>\nHandsome Dan VI was eight weeks old when he took the role, but died at age two. It was reported that he died from fear of fireworks at the Yale-Harvard game, or of shame from seeing the Yale team lose to both Princeton and Harvard in the same year.\n\n1949–1952 (retired due to emotional instability).<br>\nHandsome Dan VII was donated to football coach Herman Hickman at age 3 but he proved to have a bad temper, which suited him better in his next position as a watchdog on a Florida estate.\n\n1952 (retired due to emotional instability).<br>\nUp to this point, Handsome Dans had lived at the Yale Boathouse and were cared for in a somewhat haphazard fashion. \nHandsome Dan VIII, however, was owned by assistant football manager Tom Shutt, ushering in a new era of family membership for the office-holder. Nevertheless, he had to retire after only two games due to intense discomfort with public appearances.\n\n1953–1959 (died of acute kidney disease).<br>\nNotable for falling off the dock at the Yale Boathouse and nearly drowning (confirming the hypothesis that bulldogs cannot swim, due to the peculiarities of their physiques); some contemporary news reports say that he had to be resuscitated after having had his head embedded in the mud. He also appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine in November, 1956. \"Danny\" was born September 11, 1953 and owned by John E. Sanders, Assistant Professor of Geology, after an earlier custody by physical education instructor, Alfred E. Scholz and Varsity Crew Coach Jim Rothschmidt. He made his mascot debut at the age of six weeks and an autopsy at his death revealed that he succumbed to acute nephrotic syndrome.\n\n1959–1969 (retired due to old age).<br>\n\"Woodie\" \"aka\" \"Boodnick\", also owned by John E. Sanders, marked a return to the high standards seen in Handsome Dan V. An impressive 74 pounds, a beloved family pet as well as winner of the best bulldog title at the Cape Cod Kennel Club conformation dog show, he was instrumental in leading Yale's football team to its 9 and 0 season in 1960. He spent several years commuting to New Haven, CT, from Dobbs Ferry, NY, prior to his retirement. His registered AKC kennel name was \"Bayside Woodnought.\" He was sired by Ch. Bonny Boy of Fearnought out of Woodside's Christie Lou, and was a grandson of the famed Kippax Fearnought, the celebrated English import, who went Best in Show in 1955 at Westminster. He died in 1971 of natural causes.\n\n1969–1974 (retired due to arthritis).<br>\n\"Oliver\", owned by Yale College master John Hersey, loved football but had a tendency to doze in the sun during games. He was frequently sighted on Martha's Vineyard during the tourist season.\n\n1975–1984.<br>\n\"Bingo\", owned by history professor Rollin G. Osterweis, was described by her owner as \"pugnacious and stubborn, but lovable.\" Bingo also had the distinction of being the only female Handsome Dan. Bingo was stolen by four Princeton undergrads posing as Yale cheerleaders. They took Bingo to a friend's apartment in New York City on the run from authorities. The mastermind behind the canine-caper was Rod Shepard. The group of students took Bingo back to her owner and held a press conference for her return.\n1984–1995; 1996 (retired due to old age.)<br>\n\"Maurice\", owned by Chris Getman, was perhaps the most noteworthy of the Handsome Dans. He served in office longer than any other Handsome Dan; he was the only holder of the office to come out of retirement to serve again, due to the death of his successor; and he appeared in Sports Illustrated, in 1989. His patience with the tedium of posing for professional photographers also served him well as he posed for game programs, brochures, and the 1991 Yale Christmas card, wearing a wreath and Santa Claus hat. He also appeared at swim meets, wearing a bathing suit. His love of Yale was evident in many ways: he would sing along with the Yale fight song (at least the \"bow wow wow\" part); he would \"play dead\" when asked whether he would rather die or join Harvard; and he lost his normally docile nature around mascots of opposing teams, launching assaults on the Princeton tiger mascot and the Brown University bear mascot. (There was also an unfortunate incident involving a policeman on horseback which resulted in his being ejected from the Harvard-Yale game, and Halloweens were somewhat touchy.) He died in 1997, just before turning 14.\n\n1995–1996 (died of heart attack).<br>\n\"Whizzer\" \"aka\" \"Hetherbull\", also owned by Chris Getman, was donated by Yale alumnus and bulldog breeder Bob Hetherington and was a descendant of 52 time best-in-show winner Hetherbull Arrogant Frigott; unfortunately, he possessed a temperament so hyperexcitable that he died in office from a heart attack, and was succeeded by his predecessor and housemate.\n\n1996–2005 (unknown death).<br>\n\"Louis\", also donated by Bob Hetherington and owned by Chris Getman, was named after three people named Louis, including football coach Carm Louis Cozza. He died in office in January 2005 of a possible heart attack.\n\n2005–2006 (retired).<br>\nHandsome Dan XVI was chosen on 26 April 2005. Magnificent Mugsy Rangoon, a Bulldog from Hamden, Connecticut, was picked by a five-person panel for his gregarious personality, large size (69 pounds), good health, and his ability to deal with the raucous Yale Precision Marching Band. \nAt the auditions, Mugsy gained great favor by focusing on a crimson blanket (representing Harvard) versus the stuffed-toy tiger (representing Princeton University). \"We beat Princeton three of four years,\" said Jeff Mroz, Yale's quarterback. \"We want to beat Harvard.\"\n\nMugsy is owned by Bob Sansone, a North Haven middle school teacher.\n\nAt his first Harvard-Yale Game in 2005, Handsome Dan XVI was briefly stolen by a pair of Harvard undergraduates, in response to a Yale student stealing the Harvard flag and running across the field back to the Yale side with it. The two lured him into the Harvard student section of the Yale Bowl as he chewed a toy depicting a Harvard football player. Yale University Police recovered him, unharmed but without his Yale sweater, a few minutes later.\n\nHandsome Dans traditionally reign for a lifetime, but Mugsy is still living with owner Bob Sansone in Hamden.\n\n2006–2016 (died of heart attack).<br>\nA new bulldog named Sherman quietly assumed the mascot position as Handsome Dan XVII in late winter 2006.\n\nBred by Diane Judy of Johnson City, Tenn., Handsome Dan XVII, a 50-pound bulldog, was the half brother of Rambo, owned by former Yale football captain Rory Hennessey. His home name was \"Sherman\", after the tank and Connecticut icon Roger Sherman. He took over as Handsome Dan XVII with great enthusiasm. He was photographed with former President George H. W. Bush and Sir Paul McCartney. He was very athletic, retrieved with vigor and raised thousands of dollars for charity.\n\nHe died on August 11, 2016.\n\n2016–present <br>\nHandsome Dan XVIII was chosen in November 2016. He was born September 23, 2016 and came from a breeder in Maine. The new keeper of the mascot, called Walter at home, is Kevin Discepolo (Yale ’09), a former lacrosse player who is now Yale’s assistant athletic director of facilities, operations and events.\n\nThe Shake Shack location in New Haven, Connecticut, features a menu item named for Handsome Dan, called the Handsome Dog. The Handsome Dog, which features beer-marinated deep-fried onions and two kinds of cheese, debuted at the New Haven location but can now be found at all other Shake Shack locations, albeit as the Dapper Dog.\n\nThe TV series \"Gilmore Girls\", which is set in Connecticut, makes several references to the Handsome Dan Statue.\n\nIn the TV series Gossip Girl, Blair Waldorf is gifted a bulldog by her father in season 2, episode 16. The bulldog is named Handsome Dan in honor of Blair's aspirations to attend Yale following high school. Blair shortens his name to \"Handsome\". Blair's scheming results in her losing her acceptance to Yale, and she gives the bulldog away to a homeless man. \n\n"}

O'Neill (born February 13, 1833, Ireland; died October 6, 1863, Baxter Springs, Kansas) was a war artist and correspondent for \"Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper\" during the American Civil War. He covered the Battle of Honey Springs in July 1863, and his sketch of the action was published to a nationwide audience. Less than three months later, however, O'Neill was killed in the Battle of Baxter Springs. He is believed to be the only newsman to be killed in action during the American Civil War.\nBorn in an unknown location in Ireland, James Richard O'Neill emigrated across the Atlantic with his family in infancy. The Irish family at first lived in Quebec, but in 1843 emigrated again to Kenosha, Wisconsin. O'Neill spent his older childhood and early adulthood in Wisconsin, possibly helping out his father Charles O'Neill in the older man's duties as the Kenosha lighthouse keeper. In 1854 young O'Neill joined the Madison, Wisconsin-based Langrishe & Atwater company of traveling theatrical players. With naïve art skills, he worked at first as the company's stage crewman, designing and building sets and scenery. The company later expanded his role and he became a comic actor, specializing in Irish-dialect songs, dances, and stand-up comedy recitals.\n\nIn Madison in the late 1850s, O'Neill became a leading figure among his fellow young professionals. Local press accounts show him as the informal leader of a mock-fraternal organization, known officially as the 'K.O.T.F.N.' [possibly standing for \"Knights of the Fraternal No-names\"] but whose members usually called themselves just \"The Club.\" The club won its longest press clippings on July 4, 1859, when they produced a street shivaree that poked satirical fun at the earnest Fourth of July Madison celebrations of the time. Club members dressed up in phony military uniforms, banged on pots and pans, and hauled out a fake cannon to fire mock salutes. Indignant letters to the editor followed.\n\nIn late 1860 or early 1861, O'Neill moved to Leavenworth in the fast-growing new state of Kansas, and attempted to become a full-time painter and artist. Kansas had very few art painters at that time and O'Neill was offered commissions ranging from stage scenery to a devout depiction of the Assumption of the Virgin. Leavenworth was a center of efforts by the U.S. Army to put down the emerging Confederate States of America and defeat supporters of slavery such as were to be found in large numbers in the neighboring slave state of Missouri. O'Neill found himself sketching soldiers and officers at the adjacent Fort Leavenworth. Through General James H. Lane, he developed ties in August 1861 with \"Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper\", a high-circulation illustrated paper of the 1860s and key media supporter of the Union cause. \"Frank Leslie's\" had let it be known that they would sometimes accept sketches sent to them by freelance artists, such as O'Neill.\n\nJames O'Neill's new ties with \"Frank Leslie's\" made it possible for him to travel with Union units that were willing to have a newsman embedded with them. As an artist with experience in the stylized depiction of landscape scenery, O'Neill was able to draw detailed portraits of the battle scenes he could see. Sketch artists like O'Neill often romanticized what they saw in terms of placing all of the action within a single frame with forced perspective, but the sketch artists for \"Leslie's\", \"Harper's Weekly\", and other illustrated weeklies were careful to portray soldiers and officers accurately in terms of their uniforms, arms, and equipment. Their sketches thus serve as valid American Civil War data, especially for humble objects and items of battlefield or fatigue wear that do not usually show up in the stiff, formal photographs of the time. \n\nIn late July, an American column under General James G. Blunt thrust into Indian Territory, with the goal of subduing Confederate strength within the Territory and recapturing the Confederate strongpoint at Fort Smith in adjacent Arkansas. On July 17, 1863, Confederate forces awaited the column at their encampment in Honey Springs. Although the American column had only 3,000 men and the Southerners numbered 6,000, the Union army won the day. O'Neill sketched a charge by a battalion of the 6th Kansas Cavalry during the latter stage of the battle. After the affray, O'Neill sent his pen-and-ink sketch to \"Leslie's\" home office in New York City, where the sketch was recut as a wood engraving for publication. This was a time-consuming process; O'Neill's sketch was published in the weekly's August 29, 1863 issue, more than a month after the battle. O'Neill also worked as a stringer, sending news accounts of the Arkansas campaigns to \"Leslie's\" for publication. \n\nO'Neill remained embedded with the Union District of the Frontier under Blunt. The Union operations had regained control of Fort Smith, and Blunt took steps to advance his headquarters from Fort Scott, in eastern Kansas, to the western Arkansas river port. His headquarters column, moving southward, had reached Baxter Springs, Kansas when they were intercepted and ambushed on October 6, 1863 by Quantrill's Raiders. This somewhat irregular unit of Southern rangers, commanded by guerrilla warrior William Quantrill, did not make a practice of taking prisoners. Unarmed and ancillary personnel in Blunt's column were cut down. Correspondent O'Neill was killed in action.\n\n"}

{"id": "334547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=334547", "title": "Kishore Kumar", "text": "Kishore Kumar\n\nKishore Kumar (4 August 1929 – 13 October 1987) was an Indian playback singer, actor, lyricist, composer, producer, director, and screenwriter. He is considered as one of the most popular and successful singers of Hindi film industry and from soft numbers to peppy tracks to romantic moods, Kumar sang in different genres but some of his rare compositions which were considered classics were lost in time. According to Ashok Kumar, Kumar's success lies in the fact that his voice used to hit the microphone straight at its most sensitive point. \n\nApart from Hindi, he sang in many Indian languages including Bengali, Marathi, Assamese, Gujarati, Kannada, Bhojpuri, Malayalam and Urdu. He has also sung in private albums in several languages especially in Bengali. He won 8 Film fare Awards for Best Male Playback Singer and holds the record for winning the most Filmfare Awards in that category. He was awarded the \"Lata Mangeshkar Award\" by the Madhya Pradesh government in the year 1985–86. In the year 1997, the Madhya Pradesh Government initiated an award called the \"Kishore Kumar Award\" as a contribution to Hindi cinema. Recently, Kishore Kumar's unreleased last song was sold for Rs 15.6 lakh (1.56 million) at the Osian's Cinefan Auction, New Delhi in 2012.\n\nKishore Kumar was born in a Bengali family in Khandwa, Central Provinces (now in Madhya Pradesh) as Abhas Kumar Ganguly. His father, Kunjalal Ganguly (Gangopadhyay) was a lawyer and his mother, Gouri Devi came from a wealthy Bengali family. Kunjalal Gangopadhyaya was invited by the Kamavisadar Gokhale family of Khandwa to be their personal lawyer. Kishore was the youngest of four siblings, the older three being Ashok (the eldest), Sati Devi, and Anoop.\n\nWhile Kishore was still a child, his brother Ashok became a Bollywood actor. Later, Anoop also ventured into cinema with Ashok's help. He graduated from Christian College, Indore.\n\nAfter Ashok Kumar became a star of Hindi films, the Ganguly family visited Mumbai regularly. Abhas Kumar changed his name to 'Kishore Kumar' and started his cinema career as a chorus singer at Bombay Talkies, where his brother worked. Kumar's first film appearance was in \"Shikari\" (1946), in which his brother, Ashok played the lead role. Music director Khemchand Prakash gave Kumar a chance to sing \"Marne Ki Duayen Kyon Mangu\" for the film \"Ziddi\" (1948). After this, Kumar was offered many other assignments, but he was not very serious about a film career. In 1949, he settled in Mumbai. Kumar played the hero in the Bombay Talkies film \"Andolan\" (1951), directed by Phani Majumdar. Although he got some acting assignments with the help of his brother, he was more interested in becoming a singer. But Ashok wanted Kumar to be an actor like him. Between 1946 and 1955, Kumar appeared in 22 films of which 16 were flops and since he was disinterested in taking up acting as a career, he would find ways to be in the bad books of the director or producer, so that they throw him from their films. It was only after the success of films such as \"Ladki\", \"Naukari\", \"Miss Malaysia\", \"Char Paise\" and \"Baap Re Baap\" that Kumar developed interest in acting seriously, which resulted in him having successful films as the lead hero between 1955 and 1966. \n\nIn initial days of his career, Kumar was deeply inspired by singer K. L. Saigal and imitated his style of singing in some of his early films. He had a great respect for poet and musician Rabindranath Tagore who influenced him in many ways.\n\nHe was an ardent admirer of Hollywood actor-singer Danny Kaye. He hung the portraits of all these three personalities at his \"Gaurikunj\" residence and would bow respectfully before them everyday as a rule.\nIn his later career, Kumar was also heavily influenced by playback singer Ahmed Rushdi and his liking towards Rushdi was to the extent that he paid him a tribute at Royal Albert Hall London by singing Rushdi's some of the songs.\n\nKumar used yodeling in many of his songs including \"Tum bin jaaon kahan\", \"Zindagi ik safar hai suhan\", \"Chala jata hoon\" etc to name a few and had become the essential feature of his singing which was inspired by Jimmie Rodgers and Tex Morton.\n\nKumar starred in Bimal Roy's \"Naukri\" (1954) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's directorial debut \"Musafir\" (1957). Salil Chowdhury, the music director for \"Naukri\", was initially dismissive of Kumar as a singer when he found that Kumar had no formal training in music. However, after hearing his voice, Chowdhury gave him the song \"Chhota Sa Ghar Hoga\", which was supposed to be sung by Hemant Kumar.\n\nThe commercially successful films of Kishore Kumar included \"Ladki\" (1953), \"Naukari\" (1954), \"Baap Re Baap\" (1955), \"Paisa Hi Paisa\" (1956), \"New Delhi\" (1957), \"Naya Andaz\" (1956), \"Bhagam Bhaag\", \"Bhai Bhai\" (1958), \"Aasha\" (1957), \"Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi\" (1958), \"Dilli Ka Thug\", \"Jaalsaaz\", \"Bombay Ka Chor\", \"Chacha Zindabad\", \"Manmauji\", \"Jhumroo\", \"Half Ticket\" (1962), \"Mr. X in Bombay\", \"Shreeman Funtoosh\", \"Ek Raaz\", \"Ganga Ki Lahren\", \"Hum Sab Ustaad Hai\" (1965), \"Haal E Dil\", \"Pyaar Kiye Jaa\" and \"Padosan\" (1968). As an actor, his best period was between 1954 and 1966. His onscreen pairing with actresses Mala Sinha, Vyjanthimala, Nutan, Madhubala and Kumkum gave the biggest hits in his career. \n\n\"Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi \"(1958), his home production, had the three Ganguly brothers and Madhubala in main roles. Kumar played a car mechanic who has a romance with a city girl; (Madhubala) with a subplot involving the brothers.\n\nIn the movie \"Half Ticket\", for one of the songs – \"Aake Seedhi Lagi Dil Pe\" – the music director Salil Chowdhary had a duet in mind and wanted Kishore Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar to sing the song. However, since Lata Mangeshkar was not in town and Salil Chowdhury had to record that song before she could return, Kishore Kumar solved the problem by singing both the male and female parts of the song himself. The duet is actually for Pran and Kishore Kumar on the screen dressed as a woman. It just turned out to be fine as he did admirably well singing both in male and female voices.\n\nMusic director S. D. Burman is credited with spotting Kumar's talent for singing. During the making of \"Mashaal\" (1950), Burman visited Ashok's house, where he heard Kumar imitating K. L. Saigal. He complimented him and told him that he should develop a style of his own, instead of copying Saigal. Kumar eventually developed his own style of singing, which featured yodeling, which he had heard on the records of Tex Morton and Jimmie Rodgers.S. D. Burman kept making Kishore sing for Dev Anand from the 50s to the early 70s. S.D. Burman provided him the training and encouraged Kumar a lot, especially in the late 50s and early 60s, resulting in Kumar developing into a great singer in the future years. \n\nS. D. Burman recorded Kumar's voice for Dev Anand's \"Munimji\" (1954), \"Taxi Driver\" (1954), \"House No. 44\" (1955), \"Funtoosh\" (1956), \"Nau Do Gyarah\" (1957), \"Paying Guest\" (1957), \"Guide\" (1965), \"Jewel Thief\" (1967), \"Prem Pujari\" (1970), and \"Tere Mere Sapne\" (1971). He also composed music for Kumar's home production \"Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi\" (1958). Some of their songs were; \"Maana Janaab Ne Pukara Nahin\" from \"Paying Guest\", \"Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke\" from \"Nau Do Gyarah\" (1957), \"Ai Meri Topi Palat Ke Aa\" from \"Funtoosh\", and \"Ek Ladki Bheegi Bhaagi Si\" and \"Haal Kaisa Hai Janaab Ka\" from \"Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi\" (1958). Asha Bhosle and Kishore performed duets composed by Burman including \"Chhod Do Aanchal\" from \"Paying Guest\" (1957), \"Ankhon Mein Kya Ji\" from \"Nau Do Gyarah\" (1957), \"Haal Kaisa Hai Janaab Ka\" and \"Paanch Rupaiya Baara Aana\" from \"Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi\" (1958) and \"Arre Yaar Meri Tum Bhi Ho Gajab\" from \"Teen Deviyan\" (1965). \n\nAs a singer, Kumar's work as singer with many music directors in this period includes \"Ye Raatein Ye Mausam\" and \"Hum Toh Mohabbat Karega\" from \"Dilli Ka Thug\", \"Piya Piya Mora Jiya\" from \"Baap Re Baap\", \"Hello Hello Ji\" from \"Bombay Ka Chor\", \"Micheal Hai Toh Cycle Hai\" from \"Bewaqoof\", \"Ae Haseeno Nazneeno\" from \"Chacha Zindabad\", \"Zaroorat Hai Zaroorat Hai\" from \"Manmauji\" (1961), \"Likha Hai Teri Ankhon Mein\" from \"Teen Deviaan\", \"Suno Jaana Suno Jaana\", \"Pyaar Baatke Chalo\" and \"Kya Teri Zulfein Hai\" from \"Hum Sab Ustaad Hai\", \"Khoobsurat Haseena\" from \"Mr. X in Bombay\", \"Gaata Rahe Mera Dil\" from \"Guide\" (1965), \"Sultana Sultana\" from \"Shreeman Funtoosh\", \"Machalti Hui\" from \"Ganga Ki Lahren\", \"Mera Dil Meri Jaan\" and \"Pyar Ka Jaahan Hotel\" from \"Jaalsaaz\" and \"Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara\" from \"Jewel Thief\" (1967).\n\nMusic director C. Ramchandra also recognized Kumar's talent as a singer. They collaborated on songs including \"Eena Meena Deeka\" from \"Aasha\" (1957). Kishore Kumar's work includes \"Nakhrewaali\" from \"New Delhi\" (1956) by Shankar Jaikishan, \"C.A.T. Cat Maane Billi\" and \"Hum To Mohabbat Karega\" from \"Dilli Ka Thug\" (1958) by Ravi, and \"Chhedo Na Meri Zulfein\" from \"Ganga Ki Lahren\" (1964) by Chitragupta.\n\nKumar acted in and composed the music for \"Jhumroo\" (1961), and wrote the lyrics for the film's title song, \"Main Hoon Jhumroo\". Later, he produced and directed \"Door Gagan Ki Chhaon Mein\" (1964). He also wrote the script and composed music for the film, which is about the relationship between a father (Kishore Kumar) and his deaf and mute son (played by his real-life son (Amit Kumar).\n\nAfter 1966, as an actor, Kishore Kumar built up a notoriety for coming late for the shootings or bunking them altogether. His films flopped frequently after 1965 and he landed in income tax trouble.\n\nIn 1968, Rahul Dev Burman worked with Kishore Kumar on the soundtrack of the film \"Padosan\" (1968), in which Kumar sang \"Mere Saamne Wali Khidki Mein\" and \"Kehna Hai.\" \"Padosan\" was a comedy featuring Kishore as a dramatist-musician, Mehmood as a Carnatic music and dance teacher, and Sunil Dutt as a simpleton named Bhola. Kishore's character was inspired by his uncle, Dhananjay Bannerjee, a classical singer. The highlight of the film was a musical, comical duel between Kishore Kumar, Sunil Dutt and Mehmood: \"Ek Chatur Nar Karke Singaar.\"\n\nIn 1969, Shakti Samanta produced and directed \"Aradhana\". He sang three songs in the film; \"Mere Sapnon Ki Rani\", \"Kora Kagaj Tha Ye Man Mera\" and \"Roop Tera Mastana\". Shakti Samanta suggested that Kumar sing the other songs too. When the film was released, Kumar's three songs established him as a leading Bollywood playback singer. Kishore Kumar won his first Filmfare award for \"Roop Tera Mastana\".\n\nFrom the 1970s and throughout 1980s, Kumar sang for Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Jeetendra, Sanjeev Kumar, Dev Anand, Shashi Kapoor, Mithun Chakraborty, Vinod Khanna, Dilip Kumar, Shammi Kapoor, Randhir Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor, Rajiv Kapoor, Aditya Pancholi, Naseeruddin Shah, Sanjay Dutt, Sunny Deol, Anil Kapoor, Rakesh Roshan, Pran, Sachin, Vinod Mehra, Rajinikanth, Chunky Pandey, Kumar Gaurav, Sanjay Khan, Feroz Khan, Kunal Goswami, Govinda and Jackie Shroff.\n\nKishore Kumar sang the most songs in his career for Rajesh Khanna. Kumar sang 245 songs picturised on Rajesh Khanna across 92 films, which is an unbeaten record for singer-actor combination. Kishore sang 245 songs for Rajesh Khanna, 202 for Jeetendra, 119 for Dev Anand and 131 for Amitabh.\n\nS. D. Burman and Kishore continued with music including \"Phoolon Ke Rang Se\" and \"Shokhiyon Mein Ghola Jaaye\" from \"Prem Pujari\" (1969), \"Aaj Madhosh Hua Jaaye Re,\" \"Khilte Hain Gul Yahan\" and \"O Meri Sharmilee\" from \"Sharmilee\" (1971), \"Meet Na Mila\" from \"Abhimaan\" (1973), and \"Jeevan Ki Bagiya Mehkegi\" from \"Tere Mere Sapne (1974 film)\" (1974). In 1975, S. D. Burman composed his last song for Kishore, \"Badi Sooni Sooni Hai\" for the film \"Mili\".\n\nR.D. Burman recorded several songs with Kumar in the 1970s, including \"O Maajhi Re\" from \"Khushboo\", \"Yeh Shaam Mastaani\" and \"Yeh Jo Mohabbat Hai\" from \"Kati Patang\" (1971), \"Raat Kali Ek Khwab Mein Aayi\" from \"Buddha Mil Gaya\" (1971) and \"Chingari Koi Bhadke\", \"Kuch To Log Kahenge (Amar Prem)\", \"Zindagi Ke Safar Me Guzar Jaate Hain Jo Makam\" from \"Aap Ki Kasam\" ( 1977), \"Aaaane Wala Pal\" from \"Golmaal\" ( 1980), \"Hume Aur Jeene Ki Chahat Na Hoti\" from \"Agar Tume Na Hote\" ( 1983), \"Raha Pe Rahete Hai\" from \"Namkeen\" (1985) and \"Jab Bhi Koi Kangana\" from \"Shaukeen\" (1987). Although he was not formally trained in classical music, R.D. Burman often had Kumar sing semi-classical songs, such as \"Humein Tum Se Pyaar Kitna\" from \"Kudrat\" and \"Mere Naina Saawan Bhadon\" from \"Mehbooba\".\n\nR.D. Burman recorded several duets pairing Kishore with Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar, including \"Panna Ki Tamanna\" and \"Bahut Door Mujhe\" from \"Heera Panna\" (1973), \"Neend Chura Ke Raaton Mein\" from the film \"Shareef Budmaash\", \"Mujhko Mohabbat Mein Dhoka\" and \"Kisise Dosti Karlo\" from \"Dil Deewana\", \"Dhal Gayi Rang\" from \"Heeralal Pannalal\", \"Ek Main Hoon\" from \"Darling Darling\", \"Rimjhim Gire Sawan\" from \"Manzil\", \"Kya Yehi Pyaar Hai\" and \"Hum Tum Se Mile\" from Sanjay Dutt's debut film \"Rocky\" (1981), \"Jaan-e-Jaan Dhoondta\" from \"Jawani Diwani\", \"Kahin Na Jaa\" and \"Kaho Kaise Rasta\" from \"Bade Dilwala\", \"Sun Zara Shok Haseena\" and \"Kharishoo\" from \"Harjaee\" (1982), \"Waada Haanji Waada\" from \"The Burning Train\" and \"Kaisi Lagrahi Hoon Mein\" from \"Jhuta Sach\".\n\nApart from the Burmans, Kumar worked with other famous music directors too. The composer duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal (L-P) composed many songs sung by him, including \"Mere Mehboob Qayamat Hogi\" from \"Mr. X In Bombay\", \"Mere Naseeb Mein Aye Dost\" from \"Do Raaste\", \"Yeh Jeevan Hai\" from \"Piya Ka Ghar\", \"Mere Dil Mein Aaj Kya Hai\" from \"\", \"Nahi Mai Nahi Dekh Sakta\" from \"Majboor\", \"Mere Diwanepan Ki Bhi\" from \"Mehboob Ki Mehndi\", \"Naach Meri Bulbul\" from \"Roti\", \"Chal Chal Chal Mere Haathi\" from \"Haathi Mere Saathi\" and \"Tu Kitne Baras Ki\" from \"Karz\". L-P also worked with Kishore and Mohammed Rafi on duets for the films \"Zakhmee\", \"Dostana\", \"Ram Balram\" and \"Deedaar-E-Yaar\". L-P composed \"I Love You (Kaate Nahin Katate Yeh Din Yeh Raat)\" for \"Mr. India\" (1987), a duet with Kishore and Alisha Chinoy. Salil Chowdhury recorded songs SUCH AS \"Koi Hota Jisko Apna\" from \"Mere Apne\" and \"Guzar Jaaye Din Din\" from \"Annadata\". Ravindra Jain recorded \"Ghungroo Ki Tarah\" and the duets \"Le Jaayenge Le Jaayenge\" from \"Chor Machaye Shor\" and \"Tota Maina Ki Kahani\" from \"Fakira\". Shyamlal Mitra recorded a duet of Kishore with Asha – Sara Pyaar Tumhara for the film \"Anandshram\". \n\nKhayyam recorded many of Kishore's duets with Lata Mangeshkar, including \"Hazaar Raahein\" from \"Thodisi Bewafaii\" and \"Aankhon Mein Humne Aapke Sapne Sajaye Hain\", \"Chandani Raat Mein Ek Bar\". Hridaynath Mangeshkar recorded \"Zindagi Aa Raha Hoon Main\" from \"Mashaal\". Kalyanji Anandji recorded several songs with Kishore including \"Zindagi Ka Safar\" and \"Jeevan Se Bhari Teri Aankhein\", from \"Safar\", \"O Saathi Re\" from \"Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, \"Pal Pal Dil Ke Pas\" from \"Blackmail\" (1974), \"Neelle Neele Ambar Per\" from \"Kalkar\" ( 1983) and \"Pal Bhar Ke Liye\" from \"Johny Mera Naam\".\n\nKishore also worked with other composers including Rajesh Roshan, Sapan Chakraborty and Bappi Lahiri. Kumar sang \"Bhool Gaya Sab Kuchh\" (duet with Lata Mangeshkar) and \"Dil Kya Kare Jab Kisise\" for Rajesh Roshan's film \"Julie\". Their other songs include \"Yaadon Mein Woh\" from \"Swami (1977 film)\", \"Chhookar Mere Man Ko Kiya Toone Kya Ishaara\" from \"Yaarana\" the mesmerizing \"Kaha Tak Ye Manko Andher Chalenge\" from \"Baton Baton Mein\", \"O Yara Tu Yaro Se Hai Pyar\", and \"Laharon Ki Tatah Yaadien\" (1983) and \"Kahiye, Suniye\" (duet with Asha Bhosle) from \"Baton Baton Mein\". Bappi Lahiri also recorded many songs with Kishore Kumar, including \"Pag Ghunghroo Bandh\" from \"Namak Halaal\" (1982), \"Manzilen Apni Jagah Hai\" from \"Sharaabi\" (1984), \"Chalate Chalte Mere Ye Geet Yad Rakhana\" from \"Chalte Chalte\" (1975) and \"Saason Se Nahi Kadmose Nahi\" from \"Mohabbat\" (1987) and duets with Lata Mangeshkar such as \"Albela Mausam\" and \"Pyar Ka Tohfa\" from \"Tohfa\" (1984). The Kishore and Bappi pair also recorded hits in Bengali, including \"Chirodini Tumi Je Amar\" from \"Amar Sangi\" (1987) and \"E Amar Gurudakshina\" from \"Gurudakshina\" (1987). Another Bengali musician was Ajay Das, who composed many hit songs in Kishore Kumar's voice. He also recorded a duet song \"Hello Hello Kya Haal Hai\" with Asha Bhosle for Naushad in 1975 for the movie \"Sunehra Sansar\", the only song of Kishore. He also worked with music directors Basu and Manohari Singh for duets such as \"Wada Karo Jaanam\" and \"Dariya Kinare\" for the film \"Sabse Bada Rupaiya\" and \"Aa Humsafar\" for the film \"Chatpatee\".\n\nDuring the Indian Emergency (1975–1977), Sanjay Gandhi asked Kishore to sing for an Indian National Congress rally in Mumbai, but he refused. As a result, Information and broadcasting minister Vidya Charan Shukla (1975–1977) put an unofficial ban on playing Kishore Kumar songs on state broadcasters All India Radio and Doordarshan from 4 May 1976 till the end of Emergency.\n\nKishore Kumar produced and directed some movies in the late 1970s and early 1980s; \"Pyar Zindagi Hai\", \"Badhti Ka Naam Dadhi\" (1978), \"Sabaash Daddy\", \"Zindagi\" (1981), \"Door Wadiyon Mein Kahin\" (1980) and \"Chalti Ka Naam Zindagi\" (1982)which was his last appearance as an actor. Kumar's son Amit Kumar became a Bollywood singer in the 1974 with the song \"Apne Bas Ki Baat Nahi\", composed by Kishore Kumar for the film \"Badthi Ka Naam Daadi\". Amit Kumar became popular with success of the song \"Bade Achche Lagte Hai\". Kishore continued singing for several actors even in 1980s. Kumar performed stage shows right from 1969 to earn money to pay his income tax arrears. Kumar stopped singing for Amitabh Bachchan in the year 1981, after Bachchan refused to appear as a guest in the film \"Mamta Ki Chhaon Mein\", which Kishore produced. Kishore declined to give voice for Amitabh in \"Naseeb\", \"Coolie\", \"Mard\" and \"Desh Premee\". Kishore said he would give his voice to Randhir Kapoor in the film \"Pukar\". Since Kishore shared good rapport with R. D. Burman, he agreed to sing in \"Mahaan\", \"Shakti\" and \"Bemisal\". Later, Kishore called a truce by singing for Amitabh in a solo song in \"Shahenshah\" and later in \"Toofan\". Kishore sang the song \"Mera Geet Adhura Hai\" for his production \"Mamta Ki Chaon Mein\" and picturised the song on Rajesh Khanna. Kishore had directed the film, but died in 1987 and Rajesh Khanna helped Amit Kumar in releasing the film in 1989. He also temporarily stopped singing for Mithun Chakraborty after Yogeeta Bali divorced him and married Chakraborty. However, he later sang for Chakraborty in \"Surakshaa\" in the 1970s, and in the 1980s in many films, including \"Boxer\", \"Jaagir\", \"Fareib\" and \"Waqt Ki Awaz\".\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Kishore sang for Anil Kapoor in Kapoor's debut film as a leading man, \"Woh Saat Din\" and also recorded for \"Mr. India\". (1987) the song \"Zindagi Ki Yahi Reet Hai Haar Ke Baad Hi Jeet Hai\". He sang duets with Alka Yagnik such as \"Tumse Badhkar Duniya Mein Na Dekha\" for \"Kaamchor\" in 1982, \"Humnashi Aaake from Ek Daku Saher Mein\" and sang \"Teri Meri Prem Kahani\" in \"Pighalta Aasman\". \n\nHe had recorded the duets \"Kaho Kahan Chale\" for the film \"Bulundi\", \"Pyar Ka Dard Hai\" from \"Dard\" and \"Tum Jo Chale Gaye\" from \"Aas Paas\", a few days before his heart attack in 1981. He suffered his first heart attack on 24 January 1981 in Kolkata in the noon hours and within a gap of another four hours, suffered his second heart attack. The first solo song sung by him, after recovery from his two attacks was \"Mere Sang Sang Aya\" from \"Rajput\" (1982) and the duet with Asha – \"Mausam Bheega Bheega\" from \"Gehra Zakhm\".\n\nBy September 1987, Kumar had decided to retire as he was unhappy with kind of songs and tunes being made by music directors and was planning to return to his birthplace Khandwa.\n\nOn 13 October 1987his brother Ashok's 76th birthdayhe died of a heart attack in Mumbai at 4:45 pm. His body was taken to Khandwa for cremation. Kumar had recorded his last song, \"Guru Guru\"a duet with Asha Bhosle for the film \"Waqt Ki Aawaz\" (1988) composed by Bappi Lahiri for Mithun Chakraborty and Sridevithe day before he died. His song \"Pal Bhar Ke Liye\" from the film \"Johny Mera Naam\" (1970) was used in an episode of \"The Simpsons\" titled \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore\". His songs have been featured in several films, including \"Such a Long Journey\" (1998) and \"Side Streets\" (1998). Sony TV organised the television singing contest \"K For Kishore\" to search for a singer like Kishore Kumar.\n\nKishore Kumar's unreleased song was sold for Rs 15.6 lakh at the Osian's Cinefan Auction, New Delhi in 2012, the highest price bid for any Indian singer. The song was \"Tum hi to woh ho\", written by Kulwant Jani with music by Usha Khanna. This was for a film called \"Khel Tamasha\" by Rakesh Kumar, which never got made. The song was recorded just three days before his death in October 1987.\n\nKishore Kumar married four times. His first wife was Bengali singer and actress Ruma Guha Thakurta aka Ruma Ghosh. Their marriage lasted from 1950 to 1958. His second wife was actress Madhubala, who had worked with him in many films including his home production \"Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi\" (1958) and \"Jhumroo\" (1961). When Kumar proposed to her, Madhubala was ill and was planning to go to London for treatment. She had a ventricular septal defect (hole in the heart), and he was still married to Ruma. After his divorce, the couple had a civil wedding in 1960 and Kishore Kumar converted to Islam and reportedly changed his name to Karim Abdul. His parents refused to attend the ceremony. The couple also had a Hindu ceremony to please Kumar's parents, but Madhubala was never truly accepted as his wife. Within a month of their wedding, she moved back to her bungalow in Bandra because of tension in the Kumar household. They remained married, but under great strain for the remainder of Madhubala's life. Their marriage ended with Madhubala's death on 23 February 1969.\n\nKishore's third marriage was to Yogeeta Bali, and lasted from 1976 to 4 August 1978. Kishore was married to Leena Chandavarkar from 1980 until his death. He had two sons, Amit Kumar with Ruma, and Sumit Kumar with Leena Chandavarkar.\n\nKumar is said to have been paranoid about not being paid. During recordings, he would sing only after his secretary confirmed that the producer had made the payment. On one occasion, when he discovered that his dues had not been fully paid, he appeared on set with makeup on only one side of his face. When the director questioned him, he replied \"Aadha paisa to aadha make-up.\" (Half make-up for half payment). On the sets of \"Bhai Bhai\", Kishore Kumar refused to act because the director M V Raman owed him 5,000. Ashok Kumar persuaded him to do the scene but when the shooting started, Kishore walked a few paces and said, \"Paanch Hazaar Rupaiya\" (five thousand rupees) and did a somersault. After he reached the end of the floor, he left the studio. On another occasion, when producer R.C. Talwar did not pay his dues in spite of repeated reminders, Kumar arrived at Talwar's residence shouting \"Hey Talwar, de de mere aath hazaar\" (\"Hey Talwar, give me my eight thousand\") every morning until Talwar paid up.\n\nThe film \"Anand\" (1971) was originally supposed to star Kishore and Mehmood Ali in the lead. Hrishikesh Mukherjee, the director of the film, was asked to meet Kishore to discuss the project. However, when he went to Kumar's house he was driven away by the gatekeeper due to a misunderstanding. Kumarhimself a Bengalihad not been paid for a stage show organized by another Bengali man and had instructed his gatekeeper to drive away this \"Bengali\", if he ever visited the house. Consequently, Mehmood had to leave the film as well, and new actors (Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan) were signed up for the film.\n\nIn spite of his \"no money, no work\" principle, sometimes Kumar recorded free even when the producers were willing to pay. Such films include those produced by Rajesh Khanna and Danny Denzongpa. On one occasion, Kishore helped actor-turned-producer Bipin Gupta by giving him 20,000 for the film \"Dal Mein Kala\" (1964). When actor Arun Kumar Mukherjeeone of the first persons to appreciate Kishore's singing talentdied, Kumar regularly sent money to Mukherjee's family in Bhagalpur.\n\nMany journalists and writers have written about Kishore Kumar's seemingly eccentric behavior. He placed a sign that said \"Beware of Kishore\" at the door of his Warden Road flat. Once, producer-director H. S. Rawail, who owed him some money, visited his flat to pay the dues. Kumar took the money and when Rawail offered to shake hands with him, reportedly Kishore put Rawail's hand in his mouth, bit it and asked \"Didn’t you see the sign?\". Rawail laughed off the incident and left quickly. According to another reported incident, once Kumar was due to record a song for producer-director G. P. Sippy. As Sippy approached his bungalow, he saw Kumar going out in his car. Sippy asked Kumar to stop his car but Kumar increased his speed. Sippy chased him to Madh Island where Kumar finally stopped his car near the ruined Madh Fort. When Sippy questioned his strange behavior, Kumar refused to recognize or talk to him and threatened to call the police. The next morning, Kumar reported for the recording session. An angry Sippy questioned him about his behaviour the previous day but Kumar said that Sippy must have dreamt the incident and said that he was in Khandwa on the previous day.\n\nOnce, a producer went to court to get a decree that Kumar must follow the director's orders. As a consequence, he obeyed the director to the letter. He refused to alight from his car until the director ordered him to do so. After filming a car scene in Mumbai, Kumar drove until he reached Khandala because the director forgot to say \"Cut\". In the 1960s, a financier named Kalidas Batvabbal, who was disgusted with Kumar's alleged lack of cooperation during the shooting of \"Half Ticket\", reported to the income tax authorities, who raided his house. Later, Kumar invited Batvabbal to his home, asked him to enter a cupboard for a chat and locked him inside. He unlocked Batvabbal after two hours and told him, \"Don't ever come to my house again\".\n\nKishore Kumar was a loner; in an interview with Pritish Nandy (1985) he said that he had no friendshe preferred talking to his trees instead. Once, when a reporter made a comment about how lonely he must be, Kishore Kumar took her to his garden, named some of the trees there and introduced them to the reporter as his closest friends.\n\n\nWon:\nNominated:\n\nWinner:\n\n\n\n"}

They were considered by some ancients to be frequently polluted with disgraceful amours, which, according to Quintilian, were only a representation of the conduct of Afranius. He depicted, however, Roman life with such accuracy that he is classed with Menander, from whom indeed he borrowed largely. He imitated the style of Gaius Titius, and his language is praised by Cicero. His comedies are spoken of in the highest terms by the ancient writers, and under the Empire they not only continued to be read, but were even acted, of which an example occurs in the time of Nero.

He selected the season of Lent for his attacks, when the defenders were weakened by their fasts. He was eventually slain in battle during his final offensive, targeting the Amhara, Shewa, and Fatagar provinces south of the Awash River.\n\nSources differ over the number of years Mahfuz raided Abyssinia. Francisco Álvares states that his raids began during the reign of Eskender, and lasted 25 years. However, Beckingham and Huntingford note that the Ethiopian \"Paris Chronicle\", which draws on contemporary Ethiopian records, dates the beginning of these raids to the ascension of Dawit II (Lebna Dengel) in 1508.\n\nUpon reaching majority, Emperor Lebna Dengel decided to forgo his observance of Lent and oppose the Imam in battle, despite the advice and wishes of his councilors and people. He sent spies out to determine Imam Mahfuz's plans for that year, and learning the Imam was in Fatagar led his army there. He found Imam Mahfuz with the sultan of Adal encamped on a plain that was surrounded by mountains. After first sending soldiers out to secure the passes, the Abyssinian Emperor closed upon Imam Mahfuz.\n\nAlthough Imam Mahfuz managed to enable Sultan Muhammed to escape with but four horsemen, according to Alvarez, Imam Mafhuz knew he was trapped and sought to die with honor. He called to the Abyssinians a challenge to fight in single combat, and Gabra Endreyas, who had been a follower of Emperor Lebna Dengel's father, accepted and killed the Imam. Mahfuz's head was cut from his body and displayed publicly in the Emperor's court. After defeating Mahfuz, Dawit II used appellation \"Wanag Segad\", which is a combination of Ge'ez and Harari terms.\n\nMahfuz' daughter, Bati del Wambara, married Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi of the Adal Sultanate.

{"id": "297924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297924", "title": "Mantis shrimp", "text": "Mantis shrimp\n\nMantis shrimps, or stomatopods, are marine crustaceans of the order Stomatopoda. Some species have specialised calcified \"clubs\" which can strike with great power, others have sharp forelimbs used to capture prey. They branched from other members of the class Malacostraca around 400 million years ago. Mantis shrimps typically grow to around in length. A few can reach up to . The largest mantis shrimp ever caught had a length of and was caught in the Indian River near Fort Pierce, Florida, in the United States. A mantis shrimp's carapace (the bony, thick shell that covers crustaceans and some other species) covers only the rear part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax. Varieties range from shades of brown to vivid colors, as there are more than 450 species of mantis shrimp. They are among the most important predators in many shallow, tropical, and subtropical marine habitats. However, despite being common, they are poorly understood as many species spend most of their life tucked away in burrows and holes.\n\nCalled \"sea locusts\" by ancient Assyrians, \"prawn killers\" in Australia and now sometimes referred to as \"thumb splitters\"—because of the animal's ability to inflict painful gashes if handled incautiously—mantis shrimps have powerful claws that are used to attack and kill prey by spearing, stunning, or dismembering. In captivity, some larger species can break through aquarium glass.\n\nAround 400 species of mantis shrimp have currently been discovered worldwide; all living species are in the suborder Unipeltata.\n\nThese aggressive and typically solitary sea creatures spend most of their time hiding in rock formations or burrowing intricate passageways in the sea bed. They rarely exit their homes except to feed and relocate, and can be active during the day, nocturnal, or active primarily at twilight, depending on the species. Unlike most crustaceans, they sometimes hunt, chase, and kill prey. Although some live in temperate seas, most species live in tropical and subtropical waters in the Indian and Pacific oceans between eastern Africa and Hawaii.\n\nThe mantis shrimp's second pair of thoracic appendages has been adapted for powerful close-range combat with high modifications. The appendage differences divide mantis shrimp into two main types: those that hunt by impaling their prey with spear-like structures and those that smash prey with a powerful blow from a heavily mineralised appendage type club. A considerable amount of damage can be inflicted after impact with these robust, hammer-like claws. This club is further divided into three sub-regions: the impact region, the periodic region, and the striated region. Mantis shrimp are commonly separated into two distinct groups determined by the type of claw they possess:\n\nBoth types strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their raptorial claws at the prey, and can inflict serious damage on victims significantly greater in size than themselves. In smashers, these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness, with an acceleration of 10,400 \"g\" (102,000 m/s or 335,000 ft/s) and speeds of from a standing start. Because they strike so rapidly, they generate vapor-filled bubbles in the water between the appendage and the striking surface—known as cavitation bubbles. The collapse of these cavitation bubbles produces measurable forces on their prey in addition to the instantaneous forces of 1,500 newtons that are caused by the impact of the appendage against the striking surface, which means that the prey is hit twice by a single strike; first by the claw and then by the collapsing cavitation bubbles that immediately follow. Even if the initial strike misses the prey, the resulting shock wave can be enough to stun or kill.\n\nThe impact can also produce sonoluminescence from the collapsing bubble. This will produce a very small amount of light within the collapsing bubble, although the light is too weak and short-lived to be detected without advanced scientific equipment. The light emission probably has no biological significance but is rather a side-effect of the rapid snapping motion. Pistol shrimp produce this effect in a very similar manner.\n\nSmashers use this ability to attack snails, crabs, molluscs, and rock oysters, their blunt clubs enabling them to crack the shells of their prey into pieces. Spearers, on the other hand, prefer the meat of softer animals, like fish, which their barbed claws can more easily slice and snag.\n\nThe appendages are being studied as a micro-scale analogue for new macro-scale material structures.\n\nThe eyes of the mantis shrimp are mounted on mobile stalks and can move independently of each other. Mantis shrimp are thought to have the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom and have the most complex visual system ever discovered. Compared to the three types of photoreceptor cells that humans possess in their eyes, the eyes of a mantis shrimp have between 12 and 16 types of photoreceptors cells. Furthermore, some of these shrimp can tune the sensitivity of their long-wavelength colour vision to adapt to their environment. This phenomenon is called \"spectral tuning\" and is species-specific. Cheroske et al. did not observe spectral tuning in \"Neogonodactylus oerstedii\", the species with the most monotonous natural photic environment. In \"N. bredini\", a species with a variety of habitats ranging from a depth of 5 to 10 metres (although it can be found up to 20 m below the surface), spectral tuning was observed, but the ability to alter wavelengths of maximum absorbance was not as pronounced as in \"N. wennerae\", a species with much higher ecological/photic habitat diversity.\nEach compound eye is made up of up tens of thousands ommatidia, clusters of photoreceptor cells. Each eye consists of two flattened hemispheres separated by parallel rows of specialised ommatidia, collectively called the \"midband\". The number of omatidial rows in the midband ranges from 2 to 6. This divides the eye into three regions. This configuration enables mantis shrimp to see objects with three parts of the same eye. In other words, each eye possesses trinocular vision and therefore depth perception. The upper and lower hemispheres are used primarily for recognition of form and motion, like the eyes of many other crustaceans.\n\nMantis shrimp can perceive wavelengths of light ranging from deep ultraviolet (UVB) to far-red (300 to 720 nanometres) and polarized light. In mantis shrimp in the superfamilies Gonodactyloidea, Lysiosquilloidea and Hemisquilloidea, the midband is made up of six omatodial rows. Rows 1 to 4 process colours while rows 5 to 6 detect circularly or linearly polarized light. There are 12 types of photoreceptor cells in rows 1 to 4, four of which detect ultraviolet light.\n\nRows 1 to 4 of the midband are specialised for colour vision, from deep ultraviolet to far red. Their UV vision can detect five different frequency bands in the deep ultraviolet. To do this, they use two photoreceptors in combination with four different colour filters. They are not currently believed to be sensitive to infrared light. The optical elements in these rows have eight different classes of visual pigments and the rhabdom (area of eye that absorbs light from a single direction) is divided into three different pigmented layers (tiers), each for different wavelengths. The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by colour filters (intrarhabdomal filters) that can be divided into four distinct classes, two classes in each row. It is organised like a sandwich; a tier, a colour filter of one class, a tier again, a colour filter of another class, and then a last tier. These colour filters allow the mantis shrimp to see with diverse colour vision. Without the filters, the pigments themselves range only a small segment of the visual spectrum: about 490 to 550 nm. Rows 5 to 6 are also segregated into different tiers, but have only one class of visual pigment, the ninth class, and are specialised for polarization vision. Depending upon the species, they can detect circularly polarized light, linearly polarised light or both. A tenth class of visual pigment is found in the upper and lower hemispheres of the eye.\n\nSome species have at least 16 photoreceptor types, which are divided into four classes (their spectral sensitivity is further tuned by colour filters in the retinas), 12 for colour analysis in the different wavelengths (including six which are sensitive to ultraviolet light) and four for analysing polarised light. By comparison, most humans have only four visual pigments, of which three are dedicated to see colour, and human lenses block ultraviolet light. The visual information leaving the retina seems to be processed into numerous parallel data streams leading into the brain, greatly reducing the analytical requirements at higher levels.\n\nSix species of mantis shrimp have been reported to be able to detect circularly polarized light. The ability to detect circularly polarized light has not been documented in any other animal and it is unknown if it is present across all species of mantis shrimp. Some of their biological quarter-waveplates perform more uniformly over the visual spectrum than any current man-made polarising optics, and it has been speculated that this could inspire a new type of optical media that would outperform the current generation of Blu-ray Disc technology.\n\nThe species \"Gonodactylus smithii\" is the only organism known to simultaneously detect the four linear and two circular polarisation components required to measure all four Stokes parameters, which yield a full description of polarisation. It is thus believed to have optimal polarisation vision. It is the only animal known to have dynamic polarisation vision. This is achieved by rotational eye movements to maximise the polarisation contrast between the object in focus and its background. Since each eye moves independently from the other, it creates two separate streams of visual information.\n\nThe midband covers only about 5 to 10 degrees of the visual field at any given instant, but, like most crustaceans, mantis shrimps' eyes are mounted on stalks. In mantis shrimps the movement of the stalked eye is unusually free, and can be driven up to 70° in all possible axes of movement by eight eyecup muscles divided into six functional groups. By using these muscles to scan the surroundings with the midband, they can add information about forms, shapes, and landscape which cannot be detected by the upper and lower hemisphere of the eye. They can also track moving objects using large, rapid eye movements where the two eyes move independently. By combining different techniques, including movements in the same direction, the midband can cover a very wide range of the visual field.\n\nThe huge diversity seen in mantis shrimp photoreceptors likely comes from ancient gene duplication events. One interesting consequence of this duplication is the lack of correlation between opsin transcript number and physiologically expressed photoreceptors. One species may have 6 different opsin genes, but only express one spectrally distinct photoreceptor. Over the years, some mantis shrimp species have lost the ancestral phenotype, although some still maintain 16 distinct photoreceptors and 4 light filters. Species that live in a variety of photic environments have high selective pressure for photoreceptor diversity, and maintain ancestral phenotypes better than species that live in murky waters or are primarily nocturnal.\n\nWhat advantage sensitivity to polarisation confers is unclear; however, polarisation vision is used by other animals for sexual signaling and secret communication that avoids the attention of predators. This mechanism could provide an evolutionary advantage; it only requires small changes to the cell in the eye and could be easily selected for.\n\nThe eyes of mantis shrimp may enable them to recognise different types of coral, prey species (which are often transparent or semi-transparent), or predators, such as barracuda, which have shimmering scales. Alternatively, the manner in which mantis shrimp hunt (very rapid movements of the claws) may require very accurate ranging information, which would require accurate depth perception.\n\nDuring mating rituals, mantis shrimp actively fluoresce, and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments. Females are only fertile during certain phases of the tidal cycle; the ability to perceive the phase of the moon may therefore help prevent wasted mating efforts. It may also give mantis shrimp information about the size of the tide, which is important to species living in shallow water near the shore.\n\nIt has been suggested that the capacity to see UV light enables observation of otherwise hard-to-detect prey on coral reefs.\n\nResearch also shows their visual experience of colours is not very different from humans'. The eyes are actually a mechanism that operates at the level of individual cones and makes the brain more efficient. This system allows visual information to be preprocessed by the eyes instead of the brain, which would otherwise have to be larger to deal with the stream of raw data and thus require more time and energy. While the eyes themselves are complex and not yet fully understood, the principle of the system appears to be simple. It is similar in function to the human eye but works in the opposite manner. In the human brain, the inferior temporal cortex has a huge amount of colour-specific neurons which process visual impulses from the eyes to create colourful experiences. The mantis shrimp instead uses the different types of photoreceptors in its eyes to perform the same function as the human brain neurons, resulting in a hardwired and more efficient system for an animal that requires rapid colour identification. Humans have fewer types of photoreceptors, but more colour-tuned neurons, while mantis shrimps appears to have fewer colour neurons and more classes of photoreceptors.\n\nAn October 2014 publication by researchers from the University of Queensland stated that the compound eyes of mantis shrimp can detect cancer and the activity of neurons, because they are sensitive to detecting polarised light that reflects differently from cancerous and healthy tissue. The study claims that this ability can be replicated through a camera through the use of aluminium nanowires to replicate polarisation-filtering microvilli on top of photodiodes. In February 2016 it was also revealed that the shrimps are using a form of reflector of polarised light not seen in nature or human technology before. It allows the manipulation of light across the structure rather than through its depth, the typical way polarisers work. This allows the structure to be both small and microscopically thin, and still be able to produce big, bright, colourful polarised signals.\n\nMantis shrimp are long-lived and exhibit complex behaviour, such as ritualised fighting. Some species use fluorescent patterns on their bodies for signalling with their own and maybe even other species, expanding their range of behavioural signals. They can learn and remember well, and are able to recognise individual neighbours with whom they frequently interact. They can recognise them by visual signs and even by individual smell. Many have developed complex social behaviour to defend their space from rivals.\n\nIn a lifetime, they can have as many as 20 or 30 breeding episodes. Depending on the species, the eggs can be laid and kept in a burrow, or they can be carried around under the female's tail until they hatch. Also depending on the species, male and female may come together only to mate, or they may bond in monogamous long-term relationships.\n\nIn the monogamous species, the mantis shrimp remain with the same partner for up to 20 years. They share the same burrow and may be able to coordinate their activities. Both sexes often take care of the eggs (biparental care). In \"Pullosquilla\" and some species in \"Nannosquilla\", the female will lay two clutches of eggs: one that the male tends and one that the female tends. In other species, the female will look after the eggs while the male hunts for both of them. After the eggs hatch, the offspring may spend up to three months as plankton.\n\nAlthough stomatopods typically display the standard types of movement seen in true shrimp and lobsters, one species, \"Nannosquilla decemspinosa\", has been observed flipping itself into a crude wheel. The species lives in shallow, sandy areas. At low tides, \"N. decemspinosa\" is often stranded by its short rear legs, which are sufficient for movement when the body is supported by water, but not on dry land. The mantis shrimp then performs a forward flip in an attempt to roll towards the next tide pool. \"N. decemspinosa\" has been observed to roll repeatedly for , but specimens typically travel less than .\n\nIn Japanese cuisine, the mantis shrimp species \"Oratosquilla oratoria\", called , is eaten boiled as a sushi topping and, occasionally, raw as sashimi.\n\nMantis shrimp are abundant in the coastal regions of south Vietnam, known in Vietnamese as \"tôm tít\", or \"tôm tech\". In regions such as Nha Trang, they are called \"bàn chải\", named for its resemblance to a scrub brush. The shrimp can be steamed, boiled, grilled or dried, used with pepper, salt and lime, fish sauce and tamarind, or fennel.\n\nIn Cantonese cuisine, the mantis shrimp is known as \"pissing shrimp\" () because of their tendency to shoot a jet of water when picked up. After cooking, their flesh is closer to that of lobsters than that of shrimp, and like lobsters, their shells are quite hard and require some pressure to crack. Usually they are deep fried with garlic and chili peppers.\n\nIn the Mediterranean countries the mantis shrimp \"Squilla mantis\" is a common seafood, especially on the Adriatic coasts (canocchia) and the Gulf of Cádiz (galera).\n\nIn the Philippines, the mantis shrimp is known as tatampal, hipong-dapa, or alupihang-dagat, and is cooked and eaten like any other shrimp.\n\nIn Hawaii, some mantis shrimp have grown unusually large in the very dirty water of the Grand Ala Wai Canal in Waikiki. The usual dangers associated with consuming seafood caught in contaminated waters still applies to mantis shrimp.\n\nSome saltwater aquarists keep stomatopods in captivity. The peacock mantis is especially colourful and desired in the trade.\n\nWhile some aquarists value mantis shrimp, others consider them harmful pests, because:\n\n\nThe live rock with mantis shrimp burrows are actually considered useful by some in the marine aquarium trade and are often collected. It is not uncommon for a piece of live rock to convey a live mantis shrimp into an aquarium. Once inside the tank, they may feed on fish and other inhabitants. They are notoriously difficult to catch when established in a well-stocked tank, and there are accounts of them breaking glass tanks. While stomatopods do not eat coral, smashers can damage it if they try to make a home within it.\n\nA large number of the mantis shrimp species were first scientifically described by one carcinologist, Raymond B. Manning, and the collection of stomatopods he amassed is the largest in the world, covering 90% of the known species.\n\n"}

The aim was to build a spacecraft concept to study the effects of Mars-level gravity (~0.38g) on mammals. \n\nPresentations were given to Robert Zubrin (Mars Society), and the award for best design was given to The University of Washington (UW). The UW team continued to develop the concept until the end of the school year (June 2002), after which funding became an issue. The team from UW contacted members of the team that presented from MIT, and the two universities agreed to continue development together. Later University of Queensland – Australia (UQ) joined the team as well. The program ended in 2009.\n\nThe Mars Gravity Biosatellite program began in 2001 as a Mars Society initiative called Translife that grew out of a discussion between Robert Zubrin and Elon Musk. It was intended to study the effects of the gravity of Mars (about one-third that of Earth) on mammals, for which no data was available. Over the next few years, the program grew both scope and vision, with staff and students from MIT (Payload), UW (Spacecraft Bus) and UQ (Reentry) collaboratively designing various parts of the mission concept. With ongoing funding challenges, UW and UQ withdrew after several years and Georgia Institute of Technology stepped in to build on their design work. The effort represented the most ambitious and complex student satellite project to date.\n\nThe mission concept was envisioned to carry 15 mice in low Earth orbit for five weeks. The satellite was designed to spin at approximately 32 rpm to generate centrifugal force that they would experience as gravity on the surface of Mars. At the end of its mission, the satellite would reenter Earth's atmosphere and its cargo of mice would be retrieved. In 2007, a tentative launch date for the Mars Gravity Biosatellite had been set for 2010 or 2011, as the primary payload on a Falcon 1E or a Minotaur IV launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. \n\nIn 2005, the involved universities received a $200,000 NASA advanced projects development grant to support the development of a full payload engineering model. In 2006, the students of Mars Gravity developed a novel microfinancing platform called Your Name Into Space. This was meant to help finance the development of their spacecraft. This initiative is designed to give individuals and corporations the opportunity to fly images of their choice into orbit.\n\nBy the program's end in 2009, the project had engaged over 600 undergraduate, graduate, and high school students in aerospace engineering, space life sciences, and program management. Over 20 conference presentations and papers were published, earning multiple student awards.\n\nOn 24 June 2009, a status report was released declaring the end of this program, due to lack of funding and shifting priorities at NASA.\n\nGravity on Mars is only about 38% as strong as it is on Earth, and the long-term effects of such reduced gravity are unknown. Astronauts who are weightless for long periods of time lose significant amounts of bone and muscle mass. It is unclear if the gravity on Mars is strong enough to avoid or minimize these health problems. The Mars Gravity Biosatellite was meant to provide data on how mammalian health is affected by long-term exposure to lower levels of gravity, focusing on bone loss, changes in bone structure, muscle atrophy, and changes in the inner ear. The results from the five-week mission experiment would have been compared against a variety of Earth-based controls, including vivarium, hindlimb suspension, partial weight suspension, flight habitat effects, and short-radius centrifuge testing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5618297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5618297", "title": "Nanny (comics)", "text": "Nanny (comics)\n\nNanny is the name of a fictional mutant character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character appears in X-Men and related titles.\n\nNanny first appeared in \"X-Factor\" #30 (July 1988), and was created by Louise and Walt Simonson.\n\nNanny was once a scientist employed by the Right in the field of cyborg technology. When she discovered the Right's anti-mutant agenda, she attempted to stop them, but was sealed in one of her cyborg designs, an egg-shaped armored suit; she escaped their custody, but the ordeal left her borderline insane. At some later date, she rescued a young mutant named Peter, crafted a battle suit for him and christened him the Orphan-Maker. She also obtained (possibly self-manufactured) high-tech weaponry and a flying craft form Dr Tommy Wolf, a dwarf working for Hydra.\n\nNanny and her Orphan-Maker became a pair of would-be saviors of mutant children, with Nanny as the brains and guiding force and Orphan-Maker as the brawn. In her addled state, Nanny believes that parents of mutant children are evil, especially those who abandon their children, or at the very least too incompetent and ill-equipped to properly raise young mutants and protect them from danger and exploitation. She and Orphan-Maker travel the world, searching for young mutants to take care of, murdering their parents to sever any family connections, and using her minor telepathic powers to control them. Nanny dubbed these children her \"Lost Boys and Girls\", after the Lost Boys from the story of Peter Pan; as a result her psychosis, Nanny developed a near-obsession with children's tales and nursery rhymes, often quoting passages from them when she feels they are appropriate to the situation at hand.\n\nNanny’s first major child-snatching raid is at the State Home for Foundlings in Omaha, Nebraska, secretly a facility where Mister Sinister keeps mutant children for observation and experimentation. Nanny and her crew sought to \"liberate\" several of the mutant children into her own custody, but were opposed by Cyclops and Marvel Girl, there to retrieve the former's son, who was being held there at the time. In the course of the battle, Marvel Girl discovers that two of Nanny's \"lost\" children are in fact her sister's children, who had been missing for some time. Thwarted by Cyclops and Marvel Girl, as well as demons in the service of N'astirh (there to acquire mutant children to use as sacrifices), Nanny flees with her Orphan-Maker and \"Lost\" children in tow; Marvel Girl is forced to let her niece and nephew go with Nanny to pursue the demons who had taken Nathan Christopher. This initial appearance of Nanny gives the heroes the impression that she and the Orphan-Maker are robots.\n\nLater, Nanny and the Orphan-Maker attack the X-Men in their Australian outback-town headquarters in an effort to save them. Nanny seals Psylocke, Dazzler, and Havok in battle suits and mentally regresses them to childlike behavior. She confronts Jubilee, who is secretly living in the town, but evades capture. The tide of battle turns and Nanny and the Orphan-Maker flee in their ship. Storm pursues and is caught by the ship's appendages. After being freed from his battle suit, a confused Havok unleashes his plasma blast on the ship, seemingly killing Nanny, the Orphan-Maker, and Storm. In reality, Nanny deploys a decoy ship containing a Life Model Decoy that appears to be Storm's corpse. Nanny then regresses Storm's body to that of a child. Storm escapes, but with her memories of her adult life blurred and her childhood persona dominant. With the aid of Gambit, Storm regains her adult memories and defeats Nanny and the Orphan-Maker, sending the cyborg duo and their ship crashing into a swamp.\n\nNanny reappears much later in \"Generation X\". In the course of acquiring another child, the Orphan-Maker's armor begins to malfunction; Nanny determines that his (still unrevealed) mutant power is growing stronger, and she has to create new armor to contain it. She later sends the Orphan-Maker to protect a deformed child trapped in a schoolhouse by a mob believing him to be a mutant. This brings them into conflict with the Generation X team, who have the same goal. The heroes protect the mob and the boy's parents from the Orphan-Maker's violent methods. After the situation ends with an innocent death, Orphan-Maker escapes in a technologically advanced vehicle disguised as an ice-cream truck.\n\nIt was revealed in the \"Slingers\" series that Nanny and the Orphan-Maker were responsible for killing Ricochet's mother. They battle with Wolverine after trying to orphan Trance.\n\nNanny's mutant power is a type of low-level telepathy/mind control, which she enhances by projecting a chemical \"pixie dust\" at her victims. By unknown means, Nanny can regress the bodies of adult mutants to those of children. She can also mentally regress adults to a childlike mindset, or maintain that mindset in children despite their physically continuing to age.\n\nNanny is encased within a battle suit of her own design, an egg-shaped suit of armor that is capable of flight, teleportation, producing a repulsor field, and firing rockets, as well as possessing an inbuilt machine pistol.\n\n"}
{"id": "178755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178755", "title": "Nonviolence", "text": "Nonviolence\n\nNonviolence is the personal practice of being harmless to self and others under every condition. It comes from the belief that hurting people, animals or the environment is unnecessary to achieve an outcome and refers to a general philosophy of abstention from violence. This may be based on moral, religious or spiritual principles, or it may be for purely strategic or pragmatic reasons.\n\nNonviolence also has 'active' or 'activist' elements, in that believers generally accept the need for nonviolence as a means to achieve political and social change. Thus, for example, the Tolstoy and Gandhian non violence is a philosophy and strategy for social change that rejects the use of violence, but at the same time sees nonviolent action (also called civil resistance) as an alternative to passive acceptance of oppression or armed struggle against it. In general, advocates of an activist philosophy of nonviolence use diverse methods in their campaigns for social change, including critical forms of education and persuasion, mass noncooperation, civil disobedience, nonviolent direct action, and social, political, cultural and economic forms of intervention.\nIn modern times, nonviolent methods of action have been a powerful tool for social protest and revolutionary social and political change. There are many examples of their use. Fuller surveys may be found in the entries on civil resistance, nonviolent resistance and nonviolent revolution. Here certain movements particularly influenced by a philosophy of nonviolence should be mentioned, including Mahatma Gandhi leading a successful decades-long nonviolent struggle against British rule in India, Martin Luther King's and James Bevel's adoption of Gandhi's nonviolent methods in their campaigns to win civil rights for African Americans, and César Chávez's campaigns of nonviolence in the 1960s to protest the treatment of farm workers in California. The 1989 \"Velvet Revolution\" in Czechoslovakia that saw the overthrow of the Communist government is considered one of the most important of the largely nonviolent Revolutions of 1989. Most recently the nonviolent campaigns of Leymah Gbowee and the women of Liberia were able to achieve peace after a 14-year civil war. This story is captured in a 2008 documentary film \"Pray the Devil Back to Hell\". In an essay, \"To Abolish War,\" evolutionary biologist Judith Hand advocated the use of nonviolent direct action to dismantle the global war machine.\n\nThe term \"nonviolence\" is often linked with or used as a synonym for peace, and despite being frequently equated with passivity and pacifism, this is rejected by nonviolent advocates and activists. Nonviolence refers specifically to the absence of violence and is always the choice to do no harm or the least harm, and passivity is the choice to do nothing. Sometimes nonviolence is passive, and other times it isn't. For example, if a house is burning down with mice or insects in it, the most harmless appropriate action is to put the fire out, not to sit by and passively let the fire burn. There is at times confusion and contradiction written about nonviolence, harmlessness and passivity. A confused person may advocate nonviolence in a specific context while advocating violence in other contexts. For example, someone who passionately opposes abortion or meat eating may concurrently advocate violence to kill an abortionist or attack a slaughterhouse, which makes that person a violent person.\n\nNonviolence or \"Ahimsa\" is one of the cardinal virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. It is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. It has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of \"Ahimsa\", the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism.\n\nParsvanatha, the twenty-third \"tirthankara\" of Jainism, revived, advocated for and preached the concept of nonviolence in around eighth-century BC. Mahavira, the twenty-fourth and the last \"tirthankara\" further strengthened the idea in sixth-century BC; which was believed to be founded by the first tirthankara Rushabhdev over a million years ago.\n\nAdvocates of nonviolent action believe cooperation and consent are the roots of civil or political power: all regimes, including bureaucratic institutions, financial institutions, and the armed segments of society (such as the military and police); depend on compliance from citizens. On a national level, the strategy of nonviolent action seeks to undermine the power of rulers by encouraging people to withdraw their consent and cooperation. The forms of nonviolence draw inspiration from both religious or ethical beliefs and political analysis. Religious or ethically based nonviolence is sometimes referred to as \"principled,\" \"philosophical,\" or \"ethical\" nonviolence, while nonviolence based on political analysis is often referred to as \"tactical,\" \"strategic,\" or \"pragmatic\" nonviolent action. Commonly, both of these dimensions may be present within the thinking of particular movements or individuals.\nThe fundamental concept of \"pragmatic\" (\"tactical\" or \"strategic\") nonviolent action is to create a social dynamic or political movement that can create a national or international dialogue which effects social change without necessarily winning over those who wish to maintain the status quo.\n\nNicolas Walter noted the idea that nonviolence might work \"runs under the surface of Western political thought without ever quite disappearing\". Walter noted Étienne de La Boétie's \"Discourse on Voluntary Servitude\" (sixteenth century) and P.B. Shelley's \"The Masque of Anarchy\" (1819) contain arguments for resisting tyranny without using violence. In 1838, William Lloyd Garrison helped\nfound the New England Non-Resistance Society, a society devoted to achieving racial and gender equality through the rejection of all violent actions.\n\nIn modern industrial democracies, nonviolent action has been used extensively by political sectors without mainstream political power such as labor, peace, environment and women's movements. Lesser known is the role that nonviolent action has played and continues to play in undermining the power of repressive political regimes in the developing world and the former eastern bloc. Susan Ives emphasizes this point by quoting Walter Wink: \n\nAs a technique for social struggle, nonviolent action has been described as \"the politics of ordinary people\", reflecting its historically mass-based use by populations throughout the world and history.\n\nMovements most often associated with nonviolence are the non-cooperation campaign for Indian independence led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, and the People Power Revolution in the Philippines.\n\nAlso of primary significance is the notion that just means are the most likely to lead to just ends. When Gandhi said that \"the means may be likened to the seed, the end to a tree,\" he expressed the philosophical kernel of what some refer to as \"prefigurative politics\". Martin Luther King, a student of Gandhian nonviolent resistance, concurred with this tenet, concluding that \"nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.\" Proponents of nonviolence reason that the actions taken in the present inevitably re-shape the social order in like form. They would argue, for instance, that it is fundamentally irrational to use violence to achieve a peaceful society.\n\nPeople have come to use nonviolent methods of struggle from a wide range of perspectives and traditions. A landless peasant in Brazil may nonviolently occupy a parcel of land for purely practical motivations. If they do not, the family will starve. A Buddhist monk in Thailand may \"ordain\" trees in a threatened forest, drawing on the teachings of Buddha to resist its destruction. A waterside worker in England may go on strike in socialist and union political traditions. All the above are using nonviolent methods but from different standpoints. Likewise, secular political movements have utilized nonviolent methods, either as a tactical tool or as a strategic program on purely pragmatic and strategic levels, relying on their political effectiveness rather than a claim to any religious, moral or ethical worthiness.\nRespect or love for opponents also has a pragmatic justification, in that the technique of separating the deeds from the doers allows for the possibility of the doers changing their behaviour, and perhaps their beliefs. Martin Luther King wrote, \"Nonviolent resistance... avoids not only external physical violence but also internal violence of spirit. The nonviolent resister not only refuses to shoot his opponent, but he also refuses to hate him.\"\n\nFinally, the notion of \"Satya\", or Truth, is central to the Gandhian conception of nonviolence. Gandhi saw Truth as something that is multifaceted and unable to be grasped in its entirety by any one individual. All carry pieces of the Truth, he believed, but all need the pieces of others’ truths in order to pursue the greater Truth. This led him to believe in the inherent worth of dialogue with opponents, in order to understand motivations. On a practical level, the willingness to listen to another's point of view is largely dependent on reciprocity. In order to be heard by one's opponents, one must also be prepared to listen.\n\nNonviolence has obtained a level of institutional recognition and endorsement at the global level. On November 10, 1998, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the first decade of the 21st century and the third millennium, the years 2001 to 2010, as the International Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World.\n\nFor many, practicing nonviolence goes deeper than abstaining from violent behavior or words. It means overriding the impulse to be hateful and holding love for everyone, even those with whom one strongly disagrees. In this view, because violence is learned, it is necessary to unlearn violence by practicing love and compassion at every possible opportunity. For some, the commitment to non-violence entails a belief in restorative or transformative justice, an abolition of the death penalty and other harsh punishments. This may involve the necessity of caring for those who are violent.\n\nNonviolence, for many, involves a respect and reverence for all sentient, and perhaps even non-sentient, beings. This might include abolitionism against animals as property, the practice of not eating animal products or by-products (vegetarianism or veganism), spiritual practices of non-harm to all beings, and caring for the rights of all beings. Mohandas Gandhi, James Bevel, and other nonviolent proponents advocated vegetarianism as part of their nonviolent philosophy. Buddhists extend this respect for life to animals, plants, and even minerals, while Jainism extend this respect for life to animals, plants and even small organisms such as insects.\n\nThe classical Indian text of Tirukkuṛaḷ deals with the ethics of non-violence or non-harming through verses 311-320 in Chapter 32 of Book 1, further discussing compassion in Chapter 25 (verses 241-250), vegetarianism or veganism in Chapter 26 (verses 251-260), and non-killing in Chapter 33 (verses 321-330).\n\nAhimsa as an ethical concept evolved in Vedic texts. The oldest scripts, along with discussing ritual animal sacrifices, indirectly mention Ahimsa, but do not emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices and the concept of Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words Satya (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra; later, the Yajur Veda dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, \"may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend\".\n\nThe term \"Ahimsa\" appears in the text Taittiriya Shakha of the Yajurveda (TS 5.2.8.7), where it refers to non-injury to the sacrificer himself. It occurs several times in the \"Shatapatha Brahmana\" in the sense of \"non-injury\". The Ahimsa doctrine is a late Vedic era development in Brahmanical culture. The earliest reference to the idea of non-violence to animals (\"pashu-Ahimsa\"), apparently in a moral sense, is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda (KapS 31.11), which may have been written in about the 8th century BCE.\n\nBowker states the word appears but is uncommon in the principal Upanishads. Kaneda gives examples of the word \"Ahimsa\" in these Upanishads. Other scholars suggest \"Ahimsa\" as an ethical concept that started evolving in the Vedas, becoming an increasingly central concept in Upanishads.\n\nThe Chāndogya Upaniṣad, dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, one of the oldest Upanishads, has the earliest evidence for the Vedic era use of the word \"Ahimsa\" in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against \"all creatures\" (\"sarvabhuta\") and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of rebirths (CU 8.15.1). Some scholars state that this 8th or 7th-century BCE mention may have been an influence of Jainism on Vedic Hinduism. Others scholar state that this relationship is speculative, and though Jainism is an ancient tradition the oldest traceable texts of Jainism tradition are from many centuries after the Vedic era ended.\n\nChāndogya Upaniṣad also names Ahimsa, along with Satyavacanam (truthfulness), Arjavam (sincerity), Danam (charity), Tapo (penance/meditation), as one of five essential virtues (CU 3.17.4).\n\nThe Sandilya Upanishad lists ten forbearances: Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Daya, Arjava, Kshama, Dhriti, Mitahara and Saucha. According to Kaneda, the term Ahimsa is an important spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means 'non-injury' and 'non-killing'. It implies the total avoidance of harming of any kind of living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.\n\nThe Mahabharata, one of the epics of Hinduism, has multiple mentions of the phrase \"Ahimsa Paramo Dharma\" (अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः), which literally means: non-violence is the highest moral virtue. For example, Mahaprasthanika Parva has the verse:\n<poem>\nअहिंसा परमॊ धर्मस तथाहिंसा परॊ दमः।\nअहिंसा परमं दानम अहिंसा परमस तपः।\nअहिंसा परमॊ यज्ञस तथाहिस्मा परं बलम।\nअहिंसा परमं मित्रम अहिंसा परमं सुखम।\nअहिंसा परमं सत्यम अहिंसा परमं शरुतम॥\n</poem>\nThe above passage from Mahabharata emphasises the cardinal importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means: Ahimsa is the highest virtue, Ahimsa is the highest self-control, Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching. Some other examples where the phrase \"Ahimsa Paramo Dharma\" are discussed include Adi Parva, Vana Parva and Anushasana Parva. The Bhagavad Gita, among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the theories of just war. However, there is no consensus on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.\n\nThe classical texts of Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment. Arthashastra discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.\n\nThe precepts of Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force must be the last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its objective to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful. War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction. All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment. Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.\n\nIn matters of self-defence, different interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not protected by the rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures support the use of violence against an armed attacker. Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.\n\nAlternate theories of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to theories of just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume that the world is free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.\n\nTähtinen concludes that Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their position is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons.\n\nOther scholars conclude that the scriptures of Hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair, proportional and not cruel.\n\nThere is no consensus on pacifism among modern Hindu scholars. The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of just war prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, as being an allegory, wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where man's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.\n\nThe Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' applies to animals and all life forms. This precept isn't found in the oldest verses of Vedas, but increasingly becomes one of the central ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD. In the oldest texts, numerous ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted and hardly any mention is made of Ahimsa to non-human life.\n\nHindu scriptures, dated to between 5th century and 1st century BC, while discussing human diet, initially suggest \"kosher\" meat may be eaten, evolving it with the suggestion that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, then that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.\n\nLater texts of Hinduism declare Ahimsa one of the primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against \"dharma\" (moral life). Finally, the discussion in Upanishads and Hindu Epics shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way; which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten, whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate, and if and how one may exert least harm to non-human life consistent with ahimsa precept, given the constraints of life and human needs. The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors, but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly non-violent. Sushruta Samhita, a Hindu text written in the 3rd or 4th century, in Chapter XLVI suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain illnesses, and recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women, and the Charaka Samhita describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.\n\nAcross the texts of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to non-human life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.\n\nMany of the arguments proposed in favor of non-violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels, the rewards it entails before or after death, the danger and harm it prevents, as well as to the karmic consequences of violence.\n\nThe ancient Hindu texts discuss Ahimsa and non-animal life. They discourage wanton destruction of nature including of wild and cultivated plants. Hermits (sannyasins) were urged to live on a fruitarian diet so as to avoid the destruction of plants. Scholars claim the principles of ecological non-violence is innate in the Hindu tradition, and its conceptual fountain has been Ahimsa as their cardinal virtue.\n\nThe classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, \"Tirukkuṛaḷ,\" written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the Tamil Veda, is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. Tirukkuṛaḷ dedicates Chapters 26, 32 and 33 of Book 1 to the virtue of Ahimsa, namely, vegetarianism, non-harming, and non-killing, respectively. \"Tirukkuṛaḷ\" says that Ahimsa applies to all life forms.\n\nIn Jainism, the understanding and implementation of \"Ahimsā\" is more radical, scrupulous, and comprehensive than in any other religion. Killing any living being out of passions is considered \"hiṃsā\" (to injure) and abstaining from such an act is \"ahimsā\" (noninjury). The vow of ahimsā is considered the foremost among the 'five vows of Jainism'. Other vows like truth (Satya) are meant for safeguarding the vow of ahimsā. In the practice of Ahimsa, the requirements are less strict for the lay persons (sravakas) who have undertaken \"anuvrata\" (Smaller Vows) than for the Jain monastics who are bound by the Mahavrata \"Great Vows\". The statement \"\" is often found inscribed on the walls of the Jain temples. Like in Hinduism, the aim is to prevent the accumulation of harmful karma. When Mahavira revived and reorganized the Jain faith in the 6th or 5th century BCE, Ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule. Rishabhanatha (Ādinātha), the first Jain Tirthankara, whom modern Western historians consider to be a historical figure, followed by Parshvanatha (Pārśvanātha) the twenty-third Tirthankara lived in about the 8th century BCE. He founded the community to which Mahavira's parents belonged. Ahimsa was already part of the \"Fourfold Restraint\" (\"Caujjama\"), the vows taken by Parshva's followers. In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains were at odds with both Buddhists and followers of the Vedic religion or Hindus, whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of Ahimsa. According to the Jain tradition either lacto vegetarianism or veganism is mandatory.\n\nThe Jain concept of Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It does not make any exception for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out. Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Jains go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action. Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees. Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.\n\nTheoretically, all life forms are said to deserve full protection from all kinds of injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.\n\nJains agree with Hindus that violence in self-defence can be justified, and they agree that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty. Jain communities accepted the use of military power for their defence, there were Jain monarchs, military commanders, and soldiers.\n\nIn Buddhist texts \"Ahimsa\" (or its Pāli cognate ) is part of the Five Precepts (), the first of which has been to abstain from killing. This precept of Ahimsa is applicable to both the Buddhist layperson and the monk community.\n\nThe Ahimsa precept is not a commandment and transgressions did not invite religious sanctions for layperson, but their power has been in the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in afterlife during rebirth. Killing, in Buddhist belief, could lead to rebirth in the hellish realm, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk. Saving animals from slaughter for meat, is believed to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth. The Buddhist texts not only recommended Ahimsa, but suggest avoiding trading goods that contribute to or are a result of violence:\n\nUnlike lay Buddhists, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions. Full expulsion of a monk from \"sangha\" follows instances of killing, just like any other serious offense against the monastic \"nikaya\" code of conduct.\n\nViolent ways of punishing criminals and prisoners of war was not explicitly condemned in Buddhism, but peaceful ways of conflict resolution and punishment with the least amount of injury were encouraged. The early texts condemn the mental states that lead to violent behavior.\n\nNonviolence is an overriding theme within the Pali Canon. While the early texts condemn killing in the strongest terms, and portray the ideal king as a pacifist, such a king is nonetheless flanked by an army. It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists. The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare. In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the sangha; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.\n\nThe early texts do not contain just-war ideology as such. Some argue that a sutta in the \"Gamani Samyuttam\" rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha if it is true that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.\n\nSome Buddhists point to other early texts as justifying defensive war. One example is the \"Kosala Samyutta\", in which King Pasenadi, a righteous king favored by the Buddha, learns of an impending attack on his kingdom. He arms himself in defence, and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack. He lost this battle but won the war. King Pasenadi eventually defeated King Ajatasattu and captured him alive. He thought that, although this King of Magadha has transgressed against his kingdom, he had not transgressed against him personally, and Ajatasattu was still his nephew. He released Ajatasattu and did not harm him. Upon his return, the Buddha said (among other things) that Pasenadi \"is a friend of virtue, acquainted with virtue, intimate with virtue\", while the opposite is said of the aggressor, King Ajatasattu.\n\nAccording to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.\n\nAccording to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, there is circumstantial evidence encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha's doctrine, \"Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any.\" Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it as a matter of principle. This gives Buddhists freedom to act.\n\nThe emperors of Sui dynasty, Tang dynasty and early Song dynasty banned killing in Lunar calendar 1st, 5th, and 9th month. Empress Wu Tse-Tien banned killing for more than half a year in 692. Some also banned fishing for some time each year.\n\nThere were bans after death of emperors, Buddhist and Taoist prayers, and natural disasters such as after a drought in 1926 summer Shanghai and an 8 days ban from August 12, 1959, after the August 7 flood (), the last big flood before the 88 Taiwan Flood.\n\nPeople avoid killing during some festivals, like the Taoist Ghost Festival, the Nine Emperor Gods Festival, the Vegetarian Festival and many others.\n\nNonviolent action generally comprises three categories: \"Acts of Protest and Persuasion\", \"Noncooperation\", and \"Nonviolent Intervention\".\n\nNonviolent acts of protest and persuasion are symbolic actions performed by a group of people to show their support or disapproval of something. The goal of this kind of action is to bring public awareness to an issue, persuade or influence a particular group of people, or to facilitate future nonviolent action. The message can be directed toward the public, opponents, or people affected by the issue. Methods of protest and persuasion include speeches, public communications, petitions, symbolic acts, art, processions (marches), and other public assemblies.\n\nNoncooperation involves the purposeful withholding of cooperation or the unwillingness to initiate in cooperation with an opponent. The goal of noncooperation is to halt or hinder an industry, political system, or economic process. Methods of noncooperation include labour strikes, economic boycotts, civil disobedience, sex strike, tax refusal, and general disobedience.\n\nCompared with protest and noncooperation, nonviolent intervention is a more direct method of nonviolent action. Nonviolent intervention can be used defensively—for example to maintain an institution or independent initiative—or offensively- for example, to drastically forward a nonviolent struggle into the opponent's territory. Intervention is often more immediate and effective than the other two methods, but is also harder to maintain and more taxing to the participants involved.\n\nGene Sharp, a political scientist who seeks to advance the worldwide study and use of strategic nonviolent action in conflict, has written extensively about the methods of nonviolent action. In his book \"Waging Nonviolent Struggle\" he describes 198 methods of nonviolent action. In early Greece, Aristophanes' Lysistrata gives the fictional example of women withholding sexual favors from their husbands until war was abandoned. A modern work of fiction inspired by Gene Sharp and by Aristophanes is \"A Door into Ocean\" by Joan Slonczewski, depicting an ocean world inhabited by women who use nonviolent means to repel armed space invaders. Other methods of nonviolent intervention include occupations (sit-ins), blockades, fasting (hunger strikes), truck cavalcades, and dual sovereignty/parallel government.\n\nTactics must be carefully chosen, taking into account political and cultural circumstances, and form part of a larger plan or strategy.\n\nSuccessful nonviolent cross-border intervention projects include the Guatemala Accompaniment Project, Peace Brigades International and Christian Peacemaker Teams. Developed in the early 1980s, and originally inspired by the Gandhian Shanti Sena, the primary tools of these organisations have been nonviolent protective accompaniment, backed up by a global support network which can respond to threats, local and regional grassroots diplomatic and peacebuilding efforts, human rights observation and witnessing, and reporting. In extreme cases, most of these groups are also prepared to do interpositioning: placing themselves between parties who are engaged or threatening to engage in outright attacks in one or both directions. Individual and large group cases of interpositioning, when called for, have been remarkably effective in dampening conflict and saving lives.\n\nAnother powerful tactic of nonviolent intervention invokes public scrutiny of the oppressors as a result of the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced to accept the fact that they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.\n\nCertain individuals (Barbara Deming, Danilo Dolci, Devere Allen etc.) and party groups (e.g. Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism, Pacifist Socialist Party or War Resisters League) have advocated nonviolent revolution as an alternative to violence as well as elitist reformism. This perspective is usually connected to militant anti-capitalism.\n\nMany leftist and socialist movements have hoped to mount a \"peaceful revolution\" by organising enough strikers to completely paralyse the state and corporate apparatus, allowing workers to re-organise society along radically different lines. Some have argued that a relatively nonviolent revolution would require fraternisation with military forces.\n\nErnesto Che Guevara, Leon Trotsky, Frantz Fanon and Subhas Chandra Bose were fervent critics of nonviolence, arguing variously that nonviolence and pacifism are an attempt to impose the morals of the bourgeoisie upon the proletariat, that violence is a necessary accompaniment to revolutionary change or that the right to self-defense is fundamental. Note, for example, the complaint of Malcolm X that \"I believe it's a crime for anyone being brutalized to continue to accept that brutality without doing something to defend himself.\"\n\nGeorge Orwell argued that the nonviolent resistance strategy of Gandhi could be effective in countries with \"a free press and the right of assembly\", which could make it possible \"not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary\"; but he was skeptical of Gandhi's approach being effective in the opposite sort of circumstances.\n\nReinhold Niebuhr similarly affirmed Gandhi's approach while criticising aspects of it. He argued, \"The advantage of non-violence as a method of expressing moral goodwill lies in the fact that it protects the agent against the resentments which violent conflict always creates in both parties to a conflict, and it proves this freedom of resentment and ill-will to the contending party in the dispute by enduring more suffering than it causes.\" However, Niebuhr also held, \"The differences between violent and non-violent methods of coercion and resistance are not so absolute that it would be possible to regard violence as a morally impossible instrument of social change.\"\n\nIn the midst of repression of radical African American groups in the United States during the 1960s, Black Panther member George Jackson said of the nonviolent tactics of Martin Luther King Jr.:\n\"The concept of nonviolence is a false ideal. It presupposes the existence of compassion and a sense of justice on the part of one's adversary. When this adversary has everything to lose and nothing to gain by exercising justice and compassion, his reaction can only be negative.\"\n\nMalcolm X also clashed with civil rights leaders over the issue of nonviolence, arguing that violence should not be ruled out if no option remained.\n\nIn his book \"How Nonviolence Protects the State\", anarchist Peter Gelderloos criticises nonviolence as being ineffective, racist, statist, patriarchal, tactically and strategically inferior to militant activism, and deluded. Gelderloos claims that traditional histories whitewash the impact of nonviolence, ignoring the involvement of militants in such movements as the Indian independence movement and the Civil Rights Movement and falsely showing Gandhi and King as being their respective movement's most successful activists. He further argues that nonviolence is generally advocated by privileged white people who expect \"oppressed people, many of whom are people of color, to suffer patiently under an inconceivably greater violence, until such time as the Great White Father is swayed by the movement's demands or the pacifists achieve that legendary 'critical mass.'\" On the other hand, anarchism also includes a section committed to nonviolence called anarcho-pacifism. The main early influences were the thought of Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy while later the ideas of Mohandas Gandhi gained importance. It developed \"mostly in Holland, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War\".\n\nThe efficacy of nonviolence was also challenged by some anti-capitalist protesters advocating a \"diversity of tactics\" during street demonstrations across Europe and the US following the anti-World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, Washington in 1999. American feminist writer D. A. Clarke, in her essay \"A Woman With A Sword,\" suggests that for nonviolence to be effective, it must be \"practiced by those who could easily resort to force if they chose.\"\n\nNonviolence advocates see some truth in this argument: Gandhi himself said often that he could teach nonviolence to a violent person but not to a coward and that true nonviolence came from renouncing violence, not by not having any to renounce.\n\nAdvocates responding to criticisms of the efficacy of nonviolence point to the success of non-violent struggles even against the Nazi regimes in Denmark and even in Berlin. A study by Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan found that nonviolent revolutions are twice as effective as violent ones and lead to much greater degrees of democratic freedom.\n\nA 2016 study finds that \"increasing levels of globalization are positively associated with the emergence of nonviolent campaigns, while negatively influencing the probability of violent campaigns. Integration into the world increases the popularity of peaceful alternatives to achieve political goals.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2150549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2150549", "title": "Oxidative stress", "text": "Oxidative stress\n\nOxidative stress reflects an imbalance between the systemic manifestation of reactive oxygen species and a biological system's ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates or to repair the resulting damage. Disturbances in the normal redox state of cells can cause toxic effects through the production of peroxides and free radicals that damage all components of the cell, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. Oxidative stress from oxidative metabolism causes base damage, as well as strand breaks in DNA. Base damage is mostly indirect and caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated, e.g. O (superoxide radical), OH (hydroxyl radical) and HO (hydrogen peroxide). Further, some reactive oxidative species act as cellular messengers in redox signaling. Thus, oxidative stress can cause disruptions in normal mechanisms of cellular signaling.\n\nIn humans, oxidative stress is thought to be involved in the development of ADHD, cancer, Parkinson's disease, Lafora disease, Alzheimer's syndrome, atherosclerosis, heart failure, myocardial infarction, fragile X syndrome, sickle-cell disease, lichen planus, vitiligo, autism, infection, chronic fatigue syndrome, and depression and seems to be characteristic of individuals with Asperger syndrome. However, reactive oxygen species can be beneficial, as they are used by the immune system as a way to attack and kill pathogens. Short-term oxidative stress may also be important in prevention of aging by induction of a process named mitohormesis.\n\nChemically, oxidative stress is associated with increased production of oxidizing species or a significant decrease in the effectiveness of antioxidant defenses, such as glutathione. The effects of oxidative stress depend upon the size of these changes, with a cell being able to overcome small perturbations and regain its original state. However, more severe oxidative stress can cause cell death, and even moderate oxidation can trigger apoptosis, while more intense stresses may cause necrosis.\n\nProduction of reactive oxygen species is a particularly destructive aspect of oxidative stress. Such species include free radicals and peroxides. Some of the less reactive of these species (such as superoxide) can be converted by oxidoreduction reactions with transition metals or other redox cycling compounds (including quinones) into more aggressive radical species that can cause extensive cellular damage. Most long-term effects are caused by damage to DNA. DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation is similar to oxidative stress, and these lesions have been implicated in aging and cancer. Biological effects of single-base damage by radiation or oxidation, such as 8-oxoguanine and thymine glycol, have been extensively studied. Recently the focus has shifted to some of the more complex lesions. Tandem DNA lesions are formed at substantial frequency by ionizing radiation and metal-catalyzed HO reactions. Under anoxic conditions, the predominant double-base lesion is a species in which C8 of guanine is linked to the 5-methyl group of an adjacent 3'-thymine (G[8,5- Me]T). Most of these oxygen-derived species are produced by normal aerobic metabolism. Normal cellular defense mechanisms destroy most of these. Repair of oxidative damages to DNA is frequent and ongoing, largely keeping up with newly induced damages. In rat urine about 74,000 oxidative DNA adducts per cell per day are excreted. However, there is a steady state level of oxidative damages, as well, in the DNA of a cell. There are about 24,000 oxidative DNA adducts per cell in young rats and 66,000 adducts per cell in old rats. Likewise, any damage to cells is constantly repaired. However, under the severe levels of oxidative stress that cause necrosis, the damage causes ATP depletion, preventing controlled apoptotic death and causing the cell to simply fall apart.\n\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid and linoleic acid, are primary targets for free radical and singlet oxygen oxidations. For example, in tissues and cells, the free radical oxidation of linoleic acid produces racemic mixtures of 13-hydroxy-9\"Z\",11\"E\"-octadecadienoic acid, 13-hydroxy-9\"E\",11\"E\"-octadecadienoic acid, 9-hydroxy-10\"E\",12-\"E\"-octadecadienoic acid (9-EE-HODE), and 11-hydroxy-9\"Z\",12-\"Z\"-octadecadienoic acid as well as 4-Hydroxynonenal while singlet oxygen attacks linoleic acid to produce (presumed but not yet proven to be racemic mixtures of) 13-hydroxy-9\"Z\",11\"E\"-octadecadienoic acid, 9-hydroxy-10\"E\",12-\"Z\"-octadecadienoic acid, 10-hydroxy-8\"E\",12\"Z\"-octadecadienoic acid, and 12-hydroxy-9\"Z\"-13-\"E\"-octadecadienoic (see 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid and 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid). Similar attacks on arachidonic acid produce a far larger set of products including various isoprostanes, hydroperoxy- and hydroxy- eicosatetraenoates, and 4-hydroxyalkenals. While many of these products are used as markers of oxidative stress, the products derived from linoleic acid appear far more predominant than arachidonic acid products and therefore easier to identify and quantify in, for example, atheromatous plaques. Certain linoleic acid products have also been proposed to be markers for specific types of oxidative stress. For example, the presence of racemic 9-HODE and 9-EE-HODE mixtures reflects free radical oxidation of linoleic acid whereas the presence of racemic 10-hydroxy-8\"E\",12\"Z\"-octadecadienoic acid and 12-hydroxy-9\"Z\"-13-\"E\"-octadecadienoic acid reflects singlet oxygen attack on linoleic acid. In addition to serving as markers, the linoleic and arachidonic acid products can contribute to tissue and/or DNA damage but also act as signals to stimulate pathways which function to combat oxidative stress.\n\nTable adapted from.\n\nOne source of reactive oxygen under normal conditions in humans is the leakage of activated oxygen from mitochondria during oxidative phosphorylation. However, \"E. coli\" mutants that lack an active electron transport chain produced as much hydrogen peroxide as wild-type cells, indicating that other enzymes contribute the bulk of oxidants in these organisms. One possibility is that multiple redox-active flavoproteins all contribute a small portion to the overall production of oxidants under normal conditions.\n\nOther enzymes capable of producing superoxide are xanthine oxidase, NADPH oxidases and cytochromes P450. Hydrogen peroxide is produced by a wide variety of enzymes including several oxidases. Reactive oxygen species play important roles in cell signalling, a process termed redox signaling. Thus, to maintain proper cellular homeostasis, a balance must be struck between reactive oxygen production and consumption.\n\nThe best studied cellular antioxidants are the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Less well studied (but probably just as important) enzymatic antioxidants are the peroxiredoxins and the recently discovered sulfiredoxin. Other enzymes that have antioxidant properties (though this is not their primary role) include paraoxonase, glutathione-S transferases, and aldehyde dehydrogenases.\n\nThe amino acid methionine is prone to oxidation, but oxidized methionine can be reversible. Oxidation of methionine is shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of adjacent Ser/Thr/Tyr sites in proteins. This gives a plausible mechanism for cells to couple oxidative stress signals with cellular mainstream signaling such as phosphorylation.\n\nOxidative stress is suspected to be important in neurodegenerative diseases including Lou Gehrig's disease (aka MND or ALS), Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Depression, autism, and Multiple sclerosis. Indirect evidence via monitoring biomarkers such as reactive oxygen species, and reactive nitrogen species production, antioxidant defense indicates oxidative damage may be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases, while cumulative oxidative stress with disrupted mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial damage are related with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nOxidative stress is thought to be linked to certain cardiovascular disease, since oxidation of LDL in the vascular endothelium is a precursor to plaque formation. Oxidative stress also plays a role in the ischemic cascade due to oxygen reperfusion injury following hypoxia. This cascade includes both strokes and heart attacks. Oxidative stress has also been implicated in chronic fatigue syndrome. Oxidative stress also contributes to tissue injury following irradiation and hyperoxia, as well as in diabetes.\n\nOxidative stress is likely to be involved in age-related development of cancer. The reactive species produced in oxidative stress can cause direct damage to the DNA and are therefore mutagenic, and it may also suppress apoptosis and promote proliferation, invasiveness and metastasis. Infection by \"Helicobacter pylori\" which increases the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in human stomach is also thought to be important in the development of gastric cancer.\n\nThe use of antioxidants to prevent some diseases is controversial. In a high-risk group like smokers, high doses of beta carotene increased the rate of lung cancer since high doses of beta-carotene in conjunction of high oxygen tension due to smoking results in a pro-oxidant effect and an antioxidant effect when oxygen tension isn't high. In less high-risk groups, the use of vitamin E appears to reduce the risk of heart disease. However, while consumption of food rich in vitamin E may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in middle-aged to older men and women, using vitamin E supplements also appear to result in an increase in total mortality, heart failure, and hemorrhagic stroke. The American Heart Association therefore recommends the consumption of food rich in antioxidant vitamins and other nutrients, but does not recommend the use of vitamin E supplements to prevent cardiovascular disease. In other diseases, such as Alzheimer's, the evidence on vitamin E supplementation is also mixed. Since dietary sources contain a wider range of carotenoids and vitamin E tocopherols and tocotrienols from whole foods, \"ex post facto\" epidemiological studies can have differing conclusions than artificial experiments using isolated compounds. However, AstraZeneca's radical scavenging nitrone drug NXY-059 shows some efficacy in the treatment of stroke.\n\nOxidative stress (as formulated in Harman's free radical theory of aging) is also thought to contribute to the aging process. While there is good evidence to support this idea in model organisms such as \"Drosophila melanogaster\" and \"Caenorhabditis elegans\", recent evidence from Michael Ristow's laboratory suggests that oxidative stress may also promote life expectancy of \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" by inducing a secondary response to initially increased levels of reactive oxygen species. This process was previously named mitohormesis or mitochondrial hormesis on a purely hypothetical basis. The situation in mammals is even less clear. Recent epidemiological findings support the process of mitohormesis, however a 2007 meta-analysis indicating studies with a low risk of bias (randomization, blinding, follow-up) find that some popular antioxidant supplements (Vitamin A, Beta Carotene, and Vitamin E) may increase mortality risk (although studies more prone to bias reported the reverse).\n\nThe USDA removed the table showing the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) of Selected Foods Release 2 (2010) table due to the lack of evidence that the antioxidant level present in a food translated into a related antioxidant effect in the body.\n\nMetals such as iron, copper, chromium, vanadium, and cobalt are capable of redox cycling in which a single electron may be accepted or donated by the metal. This action catalyzes production of reactive radicals and reactive oxygen species. The presence of such metals in biological systems in an uncomplexed form (not in a protein or other protective metal complex) can significantly increase the level of oxidative stress. These metals are thought to induce Fenton reactions and the Haber-Weiss reaction, in which hydroxyl radical is generated from hydrogen peroxide. The hydroxyl radical then can modify amino acids. For example, meta-tyrosine and ortho-tyrosine form by hydroxylation of phenylalanine. Other reactions include lipid peroxidation and oxidation of nucleobases. Metal catalyzed oxidations also lead to irreversible modification of R (Arg), K (Lys), P (Pro) and T (Thr) Excessive oxidative-damage leads to protein degradation or aggregation.\n\nThe reaction of transition metals with proteins oxidated by Reactive Oxygen Species or Reactive Nitrogen Species can yield reactive products that accumulate and contribute to aging and disease. For example, in Alzheimer's patients, peroxidized lipids and proteins accumulate in lysosomes of the brain cells.\n\nCertain organic compounds in addition to metal redox catalysts can also produce reactive oxygen species. One of the most important classes of these are the quinones. Quinones can redox cycle with their conjugate semiquinones and hydroquinones, in some cases catalyzing the production of superoxide from dioxygen or hydrogen peroxide from superoxide.\n\nThe immune system uses the lethal effects of oxidants by making production of oxidizing species a central part of its mechanism of killing pathogens; with activated phagocytes producing both ROS and reactive nitrogen species. These include superoxide , nitric oxide (•NO) and their particularly reactive product, peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Although the use of these highly reactive compounds in the cytotoxic response of phagocytes causes damage to host tissues, the non-specificity of these oxidants is an advantage since they will damage almost every part of their target cell. This prevents a pathogen from escaping this part of immune response by mutation of a single molecular target.\n\nSperm DNA fragmentation appears to be an important factor in the aetiology of male infertility, since men with high DNA fragmentation levels have significantly lower odds of conceiving. Oxidative stress is the major cause of DNA fragmentation in spermatozoa. A high level of the oxidative DNA damage 8-OHdG is associated with abnormal spermatozoa and male infertility.\n\nIn a rat model of premature aging, oxidative stress induced DNA damage in the neocortex and hippocampus was substantially higher than in normally aging control rats. Numerous studies have shown that the level of 8-OHdG, a product of oxidative stress, increases with age in the brain and muscle DNA of the mouse, rat, gerbil and human. Further information on the association of oxidative DNA damage with aging is presented in the article DNA damage theory of aging. However, it was recently shown that the fluoroquinolone antibiotic enoxacin can diminish aging signals and promote lifespan extension in nematodes \" C. elegans \" by inducing oxidative stress.\n\nThe great oxygenation event began with the biologically induced appearance of oxygen in the earth’s atmosphere about 2.45 billion years ago. The rise of oxygen levels due to cyanobacterial photosynthesis in ancient microenvironments was probably highly toxic to the surrounding biota. Under these conditions, the selective pressure of oxidative stress is thought to have driven the evolutionary transformation of an archaeal lineage into the first eukaryotes. Oxidative stress might have acted in synergy with other environmental stresses (such as ultraviolet radiation and/or desiccation) to drive this selection. Selective pressure for efficient repair of oxidative DNA damages may have promoted the evolution of eukaryotic sex involving such features as cell-cell fusions, cytoskeleton-mediated chromosome movements and emergence of the nuclear membrane. Thus the evolution of meiotic sex and eukaryogenesis may have been inseparable processes that evolved in large part to facilitate repair of oxidative DNA damages.\n"}

The paternal chromosomes are inactivated by heterochromatization in all the cells at an early embryonic stage. The adult cells have one set of inactive \"H chromosomes\" and one set of euchromatin \"E chromosomes\". These H chromosomes are eliminated from the sperm during or just before spermatogenesis. In a few other species all the cells in an adult are haploid due to elimination of the paternal chromosomes at an early developmental stage. This variant is called the \"diaspidid system\" after the scale insect clade (Diaspididae) where it was discovered. It is also found in some mites\n\nGenetically this system is equivalent both to haplodiploid arrhenotoky where the males are haploid and develop from unfertilized eggs and to certain cases of diploid arrhenotoky where the males get a diploid set chromosome set from their mother but inactivate and fail to pass on half of them. Pseudo-arrhenotoky causes a female's genetic contribution to her son's children to double. This intragenomic conflict between maternal and paternal genes can lead to pseudo-arrhenotoky arising. Under conditions where the optimal sex ratio is biased, pseudo-arrhenotoky allows the female a precise control of the ratio of sons to daughters. Pseudo arrhenotoky has evolved into haplodiploidy (haploid arrhenotoky) in some species possibly due to sustained intragenomic conflict or due to pressure to colonize habitats by a single unmated female. Relative to arrhenotoky, pseudo-arrhenotoky may have the advantage of allowing DNA damage to be repaired.\n\n"}

Poultry is the most common meat slurry; however, beef and pork are also used.\n\nDark meat from poultry's characteristics, its color, low plasticity and high fat content, are caused by myoglobin, a pigmented chemical compound found in muscle tissue that undergoes frequent use.

{"id": "9907431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9907431", "title": "Soultaker (film)", "text": "Soultaker (film)\n\nSoultaker is a 1990 American fantasy horror film written by Vivian Schilling and directed by Michael Rissi. It stars Joe Estevez in the title role, alongside Vivian Schilling, Gregg Thomsen, Chuck Williams, Robert Z'Dar, and David \"Shark\" Fralick. The film follows a group who try to flee from the 'Soultaker' when their souls are ejected from their bodies after a car accident.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from \"Billboard\" and \"Variety\", but received negative criticism for its story and special effects. It won the Saturn Award for \"Best Genre Video Release\" in 1992. A sequel was planned and actors such as James Earl Jones and Faye Dunaway were named for the cast, but the sequel was never made and Schilling turned its premise into a novel. \"Soultaker\" was featured in the tenth-season premiere episode of the comedy television series \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\".\n\nDuring a summer festival, The Angel of Death (Robert Z'Dar) instructs his \"Soultaker\" subordinate (Joe Estevez) to kill five people: Zack (Gregg Thomsen), Zack's friends Brad (David \"Shark\" Fralick) and Tommy (Chuck Williams), Brad's girlfriend Candice (Cinda Lou Freeman), and Zack's ex-girlfriend Natalie (Vivian Schilling). The Soultaker notices a striking resemblance between Natalie and his lover, whom he killed in his former life. After Natalie's friend leaves her behind, Zack offers her a ride home in Brad's car. Brad is high on cocaine and reluctant to drive Natalie; he drives at high speed before crashing to avoid hitting the Soultaker. Candice dies instantly while Natalie, Brad, Zack, and Tommy's souls leave their bodies. The Soultaker takes Candice's soul and informs the Angel of Death, who orders the Soultaker to recover the other souls. Thinking they survived the crash, the four return to the car, unaware their bodies were taken to a hospital. While investigating the car, the Soultaker reveals himself and claims Brad's soul; the others, helpless to stop him, flee.\n\nThe others run into a convenience store, where attempt to tell the cashier—who cannot see them—someone is after them. While inside, they see a news report surrounding the events of the crash. This confuses the trio, and Natalie accuses Zack of knowing Brad was on drugs. They leave the store and make a 911 call but the operator hangs up on them. The Soultaker appears and grabs Natalie to claim her soul but her resemblance to his past lover stays his hand. Zack rescues Natalie and they both flee, leaving Tommy behind. The Angel of Death reprimands his subordinate for failing to take Natalie. The Soultaker later takes Brad and Tommy's soul.\n\nZack and Natalie go to Natalie's house, where Zack and Natalie tell her mother Anna (Jean Reiner) about the Soultaker. Zack and Natalie reconcile while Anna goes to run a bath for Natalie. While Natalie bathes, her mother watches her behind the bathroom door. Zack is watching television when news of the crash is shown. Natalie's father Mayor Grant (David Fawcett) announces live that the life support systems of Natalie and Zack will be turned off at midnight. During the news broadcast, Natalie's mother appears onscreen; at the same time, the \"mother\" watching Natalie suddenly morphs into the Soultaker. He attempts to make a pact with her, offering her eternal life on condition that she stays by his side forever. Zack arrives and attempts to attack the Soultaker, but is overpowered. Natalie tries to shoots the Soultaker with no effect. Natalie tells the Soultaker she wants to be with Zack and the Soultaker throws Zack out of the window. Zack survives the fall.\n\nNatalie and Zack escape and flee to the hospital, hoping to return to their bodies before midnight. Natalie is captured by the Soultaker on an elevator that leads to the afterlife; he claims he is an angel charged with collecting souls. He persuades Natalie there is nothing left for her in living realm, that Zack is already dead, and that she can be saved if she stays with him. While searching for Natalie, Zack encounters Brad, who has become a Soultaker. Brad tells him that people who kill someone—even by accident—must pay for it with service as a grim reaper. With Brad's help, Zack enters the afterlife and rescues Natalie. Brad gives Zack two empty soul rings to help Zack and Natalie return to their bodies.\n\nThey find Natalie's body and she places herself in the ring but remains comatose. Zack discovers that a pendant she was wearing acted as a barrier between her soul and her body. He pulls her soul from her body to reattempt the process when the Soultaker reappears. After a chase around the hospital, Zack is cornered on the roof and escapes by leaping off. The Soultaker is confronted by the Angel of Death, who informs him that it is past midnight and that the Soultaker has failed. The Soultaker pleads with the Angel but is imprisoned into a soul ring by his master. Zack returns to his body and saves Natalie's life; he later visits her when she is discharged from the hospital.\n\n\"Soultaker\" was written by Vivian Schilling. Inspiration for the film came in discussions between Schilling and Action International Pictures producer Eric Parkinson. Schilling based her script on a real-life car-accident event that happened to her and a friend. The script was written in the span of four months. Actor Joe Estevez starred as the titular \"Soultaker\"; Originally he was asked to play the Mayor, Grant McMillan. As well as writing the script for the film, Vivian Schilling played the female lead Natalie McMillan. Schilling had previously acted in Fred Olen Ray's \"Prison Ship\" and a nurse in the soap opera \"General Hospital\".\n\n\"Soultaker\" was shot in Mobile, Alabama, in five weeks with a budget of $250,000. In early 1989, twenty-six year old Michael Rissi was hired to direct the film after the previous director left the project. \"Soultaker\" was his first main feature; he had previously directed the 1987 short film \"Snake Eyes\", which became part of the anthology movie \"Terror Eyes\", which Eric Parkinson and Vivian Schilling were also involved with. Originally reluctant to direct, Rissi decided to join after being interested in directing a film involving parallel universes. Rissi's contributions to the film resulted in it being released as \"A Michael Rissi Film\" for both the promotional material and film credits.\n\nProblems mounted during production. In an interview with \"Femme Fatales\", Vivian Schilling noted that almost a third of the script had to be re-written because of time and money constraints. Schilling later wrote an article for the magazine about a scene not written by her but added by investors and the film crew, in which she was asked to appear naked. Despite claims it would increase sales for the film, Schilling avoided appearing nude in the scene. During the filming of the car-crash scene, the car could not be started, causing the loss of a half-day's production.\n\n\"Soultaker\" was distributed by Action International Pictures. Originally planned to be released straight to video, it received a limited theatrical release; eight prints of it were distributed in the United States on October 26, 1990. Vivian Schilling said the movie was successful in theaters but flopped in her hometown, Witchita, Kansas. \"Soultaker\" was released on VHS on January 24, 1991. It was also released on DVD by Imagine Entertainment in 1999 and Hannover House in 2005.\n\nCritical reception for \"Soultaker\" has been mostly negative, with criticism directed at the film's story, and special effects.\n\"Los Angeles Times\" writer Mark Chalon Smith unfavorably compared \"Soultaker\" to 1968's \"Night of the Living Dead\", both of which were made with a small budget. Smith said having a small budget \"doesn't necessarily mean a movie can't be fun and scary\" but \"Soultaker\" was not fun. \"VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever\" by Jim Craddock gave the film one and a half stars and TV Guide gave it one star, criticizing the storyline and special effects while describing the acting as \"adequate\".\n\nMichael Dare of \"Billboard\" directed praise towards the film in his review, calling it a \"good looking, low-budget fantasy thriller\", though he noted the film cast's overacting and its transformation into \"several layers of advanced silliness\". \"Variety\"'s Larry Cohn spoke positively about \"Soultaker\", comparing its portrayal of the afterlife to be more consistent than the film \"Ghost\". \"Time Out\" also called the film a \"micro-budget variation on \"Ghost\", criticizing the special effects and Michael Rissi's direction, but praising Vivian Schilling for her work.\n\nIn 1992, the film later won the \"Best Genre Video Release\" award during the 18th Saturn Awards.\n\nA sequel was planned for the movie; it went through name changes from \"Dark Angel\" to \"Dark World\". Producers planned to cast James Earl Jones and Faye Dunaway in one iteration of the production, and Donald Sutherland was also in talks. Robert Z'Dar commented that William Shatner was interested in playing the boss of Z'Dar's character. Director Tibor Takács was due to direct the project and production was planned for January 1993 in Canada. Eventually, the concept of the unmade script was turned a novel; Schilling said she \"embellished the premise\" and added new characters to the story.\n\n\"Soultaker\" was featured in the tenth-season premiere episode of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" (\"MST3K\"), a comedy television series in which the character Mike Nelson and his two robot friends Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo are forced to watch 'bad films' as part of an ongoing scientific experiment. The episode was broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel on April 11, 1999. The episode also saw the guest appearances of series creator and original host of \"MST3K\" Joel Hodgson as Joel Robinson and Frank Conniff as TV's Frank. Jokes comparing Vivian Schilling to Tonya Harding were made. Schilling did not watch the episode but did not like the comparisons with Harding.\n\nIn 2009, Shout! Factory released the \"MST3K\" episode as part of the \"Volume XIV\" DVD collection of the series, along with \"The Mad Monster\", \"Manhunt in Space\", and \"Final Justice\". Joe Estevez was interviewed for the DVD. In 2016, Shout! announced it had lost the rights to the \"Soultaker\" episode, resulting in \"Volume XIV\" going out of print.\n\nBibliography\n"}

The campaign was mainly against Jamaican musicians, primarily dancehall and ragga artists such as Buju Banton, Bounty Killer, and the Bobo Ashanti Rastafarians Sizzla and Capleton. \n\nThe campaign accuses these artists of promoting violence against LGBT people through the lyrics in their music and attempts to stop this. Stop Murder Music is jointly run by OutRage!, the Black Gay Men's Advisory Group, and J-Flag. The term was coined by British gay rights activist Peter Tatchell in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe Reggae Compassionate Act was an agreement signed in 2007 by artists including Beenie Man, Capleton, and Sizzla. It has now been somewhat discredited as some artists have felt it was badly worded, while others have denied signing it. Others (including Elephant Man, T.O.K., Bounty Killa, and Vybz Kartel) have simply refused to sign it.\n\nStop Murder Music (Canada) is an independent branch of the organization in Canada, founded by Akim Adé Larcher, after learning at a local West Indian store about a Canadian Tour by Elephant Man. Larcher, a Canadian/Saint Lucian, brought together over 20 organizations from the African and Caribbean communities in Canada to form the group.\nDespite not causing any artists to be denied entry visas, the campaign was able to get concert venues cancelled and also get iTunes to remove some tracks by Buju Banton, Elephant Man and TOK that they deemed contrary to their standards.\n\nThe Green Party of England and Wales and OutRage! campaigned on behalf of the stop murder music campaign, including petitioning the United Kingdom Home Secretary in 2004.\n\nTatchell has called for laws against homophobic music and the Campaign participated in protests outside concerts. The Campaign has especially objected to lyrics which they allege to support violence, including allegedly murder, towards gay men. Dennis Carney, chair of the Black Gay Men's Advisory Group, argued in 2004 that the MOBO Awards had a responsibility to exclude anti-gay artists because, \"homophobic lyrics in music normalise hatred towards black gay men.\" \n\nThe UK International Development Minister Gareth Thomas argued in a speech that, \"A number of artists [such as Sizzla and Buju Banton] are effectively contributing to the spread of HIV by producing reggae and rap songs actually encouraging discrimination against those who have AIDS and encouraging violence against minority groups such as men who have sex with men...Yes, we believe in free speech, but nobody in a democracy should be able to incite violence against minorities.\" He cited John King and the Mighty Gabby as examples of musicians who are positive role models against violence and discrimination.\n\nTatchell and the Stop Murder Music campaign have been criticized by The Black Music Council, a British organisation formed in 2004 in response to the campaign by the president of Blacker Dread Records, Blacker Dread, in order, \"to protect the rights of the eight artistes placed on the OutRage! hit list\".\n\n\n"}

He had little schooling and worked as a farm laborer at the age of 8. When he was 16, he became an apprentice to a leather-dresser. In 1769, he moved to Newburyport, Massachusetts. He married Elizabeth Frothingham, a rich widow, and bought a mansion. Some of his social contemporaries considered him unintelligent. Many of them gave him bad business advice to discredit him and make him lose his fortune.\n\nAt the end of the American Revolutionary War, he bought large amounts of depreciated Continental currency that was worthless at the time. After the war was over, the U.S. government made good on the dollars. By the time trade connections resumed, he had amassed a fortune. He built two ships and began an export business to the West Indies and to Europe.\n\nBecause he was largely uneducated, his business sense was considered peculiar. He was inspired to send warming pans (used to heat sheets in the cold New England winters) for sale to the West Indies, a tropical area. His captain sold them as ladles for the local molasses industry and made a good profit. Next, Dexter sent wool mittens to the same place, where Asian merchants bought them for export to Siberia.\n\nPeople jokingly told him to \"ship coal to Newcastle\". He did so during a miners' strike at the time, and his cargo was sold at a premium. At another time, practical jokers told him he could make money shipping gloves to the South Sea Islands. His ships arrived there in time to sell the gloves to Portuguese boats on their way to China.\n\nHe exported Bibles to the East Indies and stray cats to Caribbean islands and again made a profit; eastern missionaries were in need of the Bibles and the Caribbean welcomed a solution to rat infestation. He also hoarded whalebone by mistake, but ended up selling them profitably as a support material for corsets.\n\nMembers of the New England high society rarely socialized with him. Dexter decided to buy a huge house in Newburyport from Nathaniel Tracy, a local socialite, and tried to emulate them. His relationships with his wife, daughter, and son also suffered. This became evident when he started telling visitors that his wife had died (despite the fact that she was still alive) and that the woman who frequented the building was simply her ghost. In one notable episode, Dexter faked his own death to see how people would react. About 3,000 people attended Dexter's mock wake. Dexter did not see his wife cry, and after he revealed the hoax, he caned her for not grieving his death sufficiently.\n\nDexter also bought an estate in Chester, New Hampshire. He decorated his house in Newburyport with minarets, a golden eagle on the top of the cupola, a mausoleum for himself and a garden of 40 wooden statues of famous men, including George Washington, William Pitt, Napoleon Bonaparte, Thomas Jefferson, and himself. It had the inscription, \"I am the first in the East, the first in the West, and the greatest philosopher in the Western World\".\n\nAt age 50, Dexter authored \"A Pickle for the Knowing Ones or Plain Truth in a Homespun Dress\", in which he complained about politicians, the clergy, and his wife. The book contained 8,847 words and 33,864 letters, but without punctuation and seemingly random capitalization. Dexter initially handed his book out for free, but it became popular and was reprinted eight times. In the second edition, Dexter added an extra page which consisted of 13 lines of punctuation marks with the instructions that readers could distribute them as they pleased.\n\nDexter's Newburyport house became a hotel. Storms ruined most of his statues; the only identified survivor was that of William Pitt. His book remains his primary legacy to this day.\n\n\n"}

The tusks which earned him his name were about seven feet long (213 centimeters).\n\nNo other circus wanted Tusko and he spent some time in an exhibition road show, accompanied by his keeper and lifelong devotee, young George \"Slim\" Lewis. Tusko ended his days in the Seattle Zoo, dying of a blood clot on June 10, 1933.\n\n\"Tusko\" was also the name of a male Indian elephant at the Oklahoma City Zoo. On August 3, 1962, researchers from the University of Oklahoma injected (human use involves oral ingestion) 297 mg of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) to him, which is over 1,000 times the dose typical of human recreational use. Within five minutes he collapsed to the ground and one hour and forty minutes later he died. It is believed that the LSD was the cause of his death, although some speculate that the drugs the researchers used in an attempt to revive him may have contributed to his death.\n\nAn Asian elephant by the name \"Tusko\" resided at the Oregon Zoo in Portland, Oregon from 2005 until December 2015. It is believed he was born in the wilds of Thailand around 1970, and was about 45 years old by the time of his death.\n\nTusko arrived at the Oregon Zoo in June 2005 on a breeding loan. He had successfully sired three calves in the past; two while living in Canada and one in California. Tusko had also successfully mated with Rose-Tu, the youngest elephant in the herd at the time. On August 23, 2008, she delivered her first offspring, a male named Samudra and nicknamed Sam. Sam is also the first third-generation elephant born in the United States. Zoo officials have stated that they were very lucky to find a bull like Tusko. He was a good match for the herd, providing genetic diversity as well as great social skills, experience with calves, a gentle nature with the females and positive role model for Samudra.\n\nRose-Tu and Tusko again mated successfully in 2011 and her second calf, a female named Lily, was born on November 30, 2012. A controversy was sparked when the \"Seattle Times\" reported that the new baby would become the property of Perris-based Have Trunk Will Travel, a company which offers elephant rides at fairs, zoos and weddings. Zoo officials explained that although the breeding contract states that the zoo owns the first, third and fifth of Tusko's offspring, while the California company owns the second, fourth and sixth baby elephant, there are no plans to ship the elephant to California. The plan has always been for Rose-Tu and her baby to stay together their whole lives as they would in the wild; however, the legal details of the arrangement cannot be negotiated before the elephant is one month old. Eventually, the Oregon Zoo foundation did a fundraiser to purchase both Lily and Tusko for $400,000, giving the zoo legal ownership of both.\n\nThere were plans for Tusko to also mate with the zoo's other two females, Shine and Chendra, although they never materialized. Tusko underwent two surgeries to have his tusks removed due to risk of chronic infection. He was blind in his right eye.\n\nIn June 2014, the elephant tested positive for tuberculosis. An 18-month treatment began that year.\n\nIn late December 2015, a decades-old right-rear foot injury flared up, forcing Tusko to use his other three legs and his trunk to bear weight. His right-front foot then became infected and swollen, and Tusko had difficulty standing and walking. He was euthanized on December 22, 2015. Zoo officials said they did not know exactly how the injury occurred, however that it had happened while he was a circus elephant.\n\n"}

She was launched on 6 March 1942 (sponsored by Mrs. Randall Jacobs), and commissioned on 19 June 1942, Lieutenant Commander John A. Bole, Jr. in command.\n\nAfter shakedown training in waters off New London, Connecticut and Newport, Rhode Island, \"Amberjack\" got underway on 20 July, bound for the Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal in mid-August and reached Pearl Harbor on 20 August. Following training exercises, \"Amberjack\" got underway for her first war patrol on 3 September. Two days later, she touched at Johnston Island to refuel and, later that day, resumed her voyage to her patrol area between the northeast coast of New Ireland and Bougainville, Solomon Islands.\n\nOn 15 September, \"Amberjack\" was patrolling off Kavieng, New Ireland. Three days later, she made contact with a large Japanese transport escorted by a destroyer, and fired a spread of four torpedoes at the vessels, but none hit. While patrolling in Bougainville Strait on 19 September, the submarine launched two torpedoes at an enemy freighter. The first hit under the target's bridge, and the second broke her keel in two. \"Amberjack\" was credited with having sunk \"Shirogane Maru\".\n\n\"Amberjack\" made her next contact with Japanese shipping on 25 September, spotting a large cruiser escorted by a destroyer. However, before the submarine could get into position for an attack, the destroyer headed toward her and forced her to go deep. Several depth charges were dropped on the submarine, but they inflicted no damage. During the next few days, \"Amberjack\" reconnoitered Tau, Kilinailau, Greenwich Island, and Ocean Island.\n\nThe submarine spotted a Japanese cruiser on the morning of 30 September and launched four torpedoes from her bow tubes. None hit, so she fired another two forward tubes shortly thereafter. These also went wide of the mark, and the cruiser escaped damage. One week later, the submarine was patrolling off Kavieng when she spotted smoke on the horizon. After a Japanese cargo ship sailed into view, \"Amberjack\" launched two torpedoes. One missed forward and the other hit the target's hull forward. The enemy ship was still able to continue under her own power and \"Amberjack\" took up pursuit. About one hour later, both sides opened fire with their deck guns but neither was within range of the other and they broke off fire. After two more hours of the chase, the submarine fired a slow speed torpedo which hit its target five minutes later. The cargo vessel, later identified as \"Senkai Maru\", swung left and seemed to stop. Its bow swung up in the air, the ship took a vertical position, and sank from sight shortly thereafter. Lifeboats carrying the cargo ship's survivors were later spotted as the submarine headed for Kavieng.\n\nWhile patrolling off Kavieng Harbor on 10 October, \"Amberjack\" spotted Japanese ships in the harbor and launched four torpedoes into the anchorage. One damaged a freighter and another damaged \"Tonan Maru II\", (19,262 tons) which was being used to ferry airplanes. The vessel sank in shallow water, but was later salvaged, towed to Japan for repairs, and was returned to service. On 16 October, the submarine headed for Espiritu Santo for repairs to her ballast tanks and arrived there on 19 October. While undergoing repairs, she was assigned the task of hauling aviation gas, bombs, and personnel to Guadalcanal. While en route to the Solomons, her destination was changed to Tulagi. She arrived there on 25 October and unloaded her embarked troops and cargo under the cover of darkness. The next day, she set course for Brisbane, Australia, and reached that port on 30 October.\n\nAfter a refit alongside and a series of training exercises, \"Amberjack\" began her second war patrol on 21 November. On the morning of 27 November, the submarine encountered two enemy destroyers which were probably carrying supplies for Japanese forces on Guadalcanal. While launching four torpedoes from her stern tubes, the submarine heard the screws of a third ship crossing ahead of her bow. None of the torpedoes hit their target, and the submarine began to take action to avoid depth charges. Approximately two hours later, all sounds had faded away, and the submarine rose to the surface to look for signs of damage. She spotted nothing so she assumed a new station at the southern end of the eastern entrance to Shortland Harbor.\n\nOn 29 November, while on patrol ten miles (16 km) east of the Treasury Islands, \"Amberjack\" spotted a surfaced Japanese submarine. Before she could set up an attack, however, the enemy vessel rapidly drew away. She again saw a Japanese submarine on 3 December proceeding toward the entrance to Shortland harbor and sent four torpedoes toward the fleeing enemy, but all failed to hit. During the next one and one-half weeks, she made numerous ship contacts, but carried out no attacks. On 15 December, the submarine sighted a convoy consisting of four or five ships on a course for Rabaul and launched two torpedoes at a large freighter, one at a small tanker, and one more at a small freighter. However, she apparently inflicted no damage on any of the targets.\n\nHer next contact occurred on 20 December. While patrolling submerged, \"Amberjack\" began hearing a series of explosions which drew closer and closer. She surfaced and saw two Japanese destroyer escorts, which soon thereafter began raining depth charges on the submarine. Within the space of one minute, six exploded close aboard, shook the vessel considerably, and caused numerous broken light bulbs forward. Some fittings mounted on the overhead were broken off, and several valves were sprung open. However, the submarine suffered no crippling damage and moved on to continue her patrol off the northeast coast of New Ireland.\n\nShe spotted another Japanese ship on 3 January 1943, a destroyer which apparently was waiting to rendezvous with a convoy from the Palau Islands. The submarine was unable to attack the ship and, two days later, set a course for Brisbane, Queensland. She reached that port on 11 January and safely concluded her patrol.\n\nFollowing this patrol, the submarine's period of refit was cut to 12 days due to the urgent need for submarines to patrol enemy infested waters. She got underway on 24 January but was forced to return to Brisbane for repair of minor leaks which developed during a deep dive. Again departing Brisbane on 26 January, \"Amberjack\" started her third war patrol in the Solomons area. On 29 January she was directed to pass close to Tetipari Island and then proceed to the northwest and patrol the approaches to Shortland Basin. Orders were radioed on 1 February for her to move north and patrol the western approaches to Buka Passage. Having complied with these orders, \"Amberjack\" made her first miles southeast of Treasury Island on 1 February, and of sinking a two-masted schooner by gunfire from Buka the afternoon of 3 February 1943. At this time she was ordered to move south along the Buka-Shortland traffic lane and patrol east of Vella Lavella Island.\n\nIn a second radio transmission on 4 February, \"Amberjack\" reported having sunk a 5,000 ton freighter laden with explosives in a two-hour night surface attack that date in which five torpedoes were fired. During this engagement, an officer was slightly wounded in the hand by machine gun fire. Chief Pharmacist's Mate Arthur C. Beeman, went to the bridge to assist the officer and was killed by machine gun fire. On 8 February, \"Amberjack\" was ordered to move to the west side of Ganongga Island and on 10 February, she was directed to keep south of latitude 7°30'S and to cover the traffic routes from Rabaul and Buka Island to Shortland Basin. On 13 February, \"Amberjack\" was assigned the entire Rabaul-Buka-Shortland Sea area and told to hunt for traffic.\n\nThe last radio transmission received from \"Amberjack\" was made on 14 February. She related having been forced down the night before by two destroyers, and that she had recovered from the water and taken prisoner an enemy aviator on 13 February. She was ordered north of latitude 6°30'S, and told to keep hunting for Rabaul traffic.\n\nAll further messages to \"Amberjack\" remained unanswered, and when, by 10 March, she had failed to make her routine report estimating the time of her arrival at base, she was ordered to do so. No reply was received, and she was reported as presumed lost on 22 March 1943.\n\nReports received from the enemy after the war record an attack which probably sank \"Amberjack\". On 16 February 1943, \"Hiyodori\" and \"Sub Chaser Number 18\" attacked a U.S. submarine with nine depth charges at about . An escorting patrol plane had previously attacked the submarine. A large amount of heavy oil and \"parts of the hull\" came to the surface. This attack is believed to have sunk \"Amberjack\". However, no final conclusions can be drawn, since was lost in the same area at about the same time. From the evidence available, it is considered most likely that the attack of 16 February sank \"Amberjack\", but if she did survive this attack, any one of the attacks and sightings thought to have been made on \"Grampus\" might have been made on \"Amberjack\".\n\n\"Amberjack\" won three battle stars for her World War II service, and was credited with sinking three ships, for a total of 28,600 tons while damaging two more ships for 14,000 tons damaged.\n\nThe enlisted men's recreation center at Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor, is named for Chief Pharmacist's Mate Arthur C. Beeman, who was killed in the gun battle of 4 February 1943.\n\n"}
{"id": "852252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=852252", "title": "Untouchability", "text": "Untouchability\n\nUntouchability, in its literal sense, is the practice of ostracising a minority group by segregating them from the mainstream by social custom or legal mandate. The term is most commonly associated with treatment of the Dalit communities in the Indian subcontinent who were considered \"polluting\", but the term has also been loosely used to refer to other groups, such as the Cagots in Europe, and the Al-Akhdam in Yemen. Traditionally, the groups characterized as untouchable were those whose occupations and habits of life involved ritually polluting activities, such as fishermen, manual scavengers, sweepers and washermen.\n\nUntouchability has been outlawed in India, Nepal and Pakistan. However, \"untouchability\" has not been legally defined. The origin of untouchability and its historicity are still debated, but it is believed to have existed at least as far back as 400 CE. A recent study of a sample of households in India concludes that \"Notwithstanding the likelihood of under-reporting of the practice of untouchability, 70 percent of the population reported not indulging in this practice. This is an encouraging sign.\"\n\nB. R. Ambedkar, a social reformer and politician who came from a social group that was considered untouchable, theorized that untouchability originated because of the deliberate policy of the upper-caste Brahmanas. According to him, the Brahmanas despised the people who gave up the Brahmanism in favour of Buddhism. Later scholars such as Vivekanand Jha have successfully refuted this theory.\n\nNripendra Kumar Dutt, a professor of history, theorized that the concept of untouchability originated from the \"pariah\"-like treatment accorded to the aboriginies of India by the early Dravidians, and that the concept was borrowed by the Indo-Aryans from the Dravidians. Scholars such as R. S. Sharma have rejected this theory, arguing that there is no evidence that Dravidians practised untouchability before coming into contact with the Indo-Aryans.\n\nAustrian ethnologist Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf theorized that untouchability originated as class stratification in urban areas of the Indus Valley Civilisation. According to this theory, the poorer workers involved in 'unclean' occupations such as sweeping or leather work were historically segregated and banished outside the city limits. Over time, personal cleanliness came to be identified \"purity\", and the concept of untouchability eventually spread to rural areas as well. After the decline of the Indus Valley towns, these untouchables probably spread to other parts of India. Scholars such as Suvira Jaiswal reject this theory, arguing that it lacks evidence, and does not explain why the concept of untouchability is more pronounced in rural areas.\n\nAmerican scholar George L. Hart, based on his interpretation of Old Tamil texts such as \"Purananuru\", traced the origin of untouchability to ancient Tamil society. According to him, in this society, certain occupational groups were thought to be involved in controlling the malevolent supernatural forces; as an example, Hart mentions the Paraiyars, who played drums during battles and solemn events such as births and deaths. People from these occupational groups came to be avoided by others, who believed that they were \"dangerous and had the power to pollute the others\". Jaiswal dismisses the evidence produced by Hart as \"extremely weak\" and contradictory. Jaiswal points out that the authors of the ancient Tamil texts included several Brahmanas (a fact accepted by Hart); thus, the society described in these texts was already under Brahmanical influence, and could have borrowed the concept of untouchability from them.\n\nBritish anthropologist John Henry Hutton traced the origin of untouchability to the taboo on accepting food cooked by a person from a different caste. This taboo presumably originated because of cleanliness concerns, and ultimately, led to other prejudices such as the taboo on marrying outside one's caste. Jaiswal argues that this theory cannot explain how various social groups were isolated as untouchable or accorded a social rank. Jaiswal also notes that several passages from the ancient Vedic texts indicate that there was no taboo against accepting food from people belonging to a different varna or tribe. For example, some Shrauta Sutras mandate that a performer of the Vishvajit sacrifice must live with the Nishadas (a tribe regarded as untouchable in later period) for three days, in their village, and eat their food.\n\nScholars such as Suvira Jaiswal, R. S. Sharma, and Vivekanand Jha characterize untouchability as a relatively later development after the establishment of the varna and caste system. Jha notes that the earliest Vedic text \"Rigveda\" makes no mention of untouchability, and even the later Vedic texts, which revile certain groups such as the Chandalas, do not suggest that untouchability existed in the contemporary society. According to Jha, in the later period, several groups began to be characterized as untouchable, a development which reached its peak during 600-1200 CE. Sharma theorizes that institution of untouchability arose when the aboriginal tribes with \"low material culture\" and \"uncertain means of livelihood\" came to be regarded as impure by the privileged classes who despised manual labour, and regarded associated impurity with \"certain material objects\". According to Jaiswal, when the members of aboriginal groups were assimilated into the Brahmanical society, the privileged among them may have tried to assert their higher status by disassociating themselves from their lower-status counterparts, who were gradually branded as untouchables.\n\nUntouchability is believed to have been first mentioned in \"Dharmashastra\". According to the text, untouchables were not considered a part of the varna system because of their grievous sins, barbaric or unethical acts such as murder, harassment etc. Therefore, they were not treated like the savarnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras).\n\nAccording to Sarah Pinto, an anthropologist, modern untouchability in India applies to people whose work relates to \"meat, and bodily fluids\". In the name of untouchability, Dalits have faced work and descent-based discrimination at the hands of the dominant castes. Based on the punishments prescribed in The Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 the following practices could be understood to have been associated with Untouchability in India:\n\n\nAt the time of Indian independence, Dalit activists began calling for separate electorates for untouchables in India to allow fair representation. Officially labeled the Minorities Act, it would guarantee representation for Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, and Untouchables in the newly formed Indian government. The Act was supported by British representatives such as Ramsay MacDonald. According to the textbook,\"Religions in the Modern World\", B.R. Ambedkar, who was also a supporter of the Act, was considered to be the “untouchable leader” who made great efforts to eliminate caste system privileges that included participation in public festivals, access to temples, and wedding rituals. In 1932, Ambedkar proposed that the untouchables create a separate electorate that ultimately led Gandhi to fast until it was rejected.\n\nA separation within Hindu society was opposed by national leaders at the time such as Gandhi, although he took no exception to the demands of the other minorities. He began a hunger strike to protest this type of affirmative action, citing that it would create an unhealthy divide within the religion. At the Round Table Conferences, he provided this explanation for his reasoning:I don't mind untouchables if they so desire, being converted to Islam or Christianity. I should tolerate that, but I cannot possibly tolerate what is in store for Hinduism if there are two divisions set forth in the villages. Those who speak of the political rights of the untouchables don't know their India, don't know how Indian society is today constituted and therefore I want to say with all the emphasis that I can command that if I was the only person to resist this thing that I would resist it with my life.Gandhi achieved some success through his hunger strike. Dalit activists faced pressure from the Hindu population at large to end his protest at the risk of his ailing health. The two sides eventually came to a compromise where the number of guaranteed seats for Untouchables would be reduced, but not totally eliminated.\n\nThe 1950 national constitution of India legally abolished the practice of untouchability and provided measures for positive discrimination in both educational institutions and public services for Dalits and other social groups who lie within the caste system. These are supplemented by official bodies such as the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\nDespite this, instances of prejudice against Dalits still occur in some rural areas, as evidenced by events such as the Kherlanji massacre.\n\nFrance: Cagots were historically untouchable groups of France.\n\nKorea: Baekjeong in Korea are an \"untouchable” group of Korea who traditionally performed jobs of executioner and butcher.\n\nYemen: Al-Akhdam\n\nTibet : Ragyabpa (see Social classes of Tibet)\n\nOthers: * Tanka (danhu) (\"boat people\") in Guangdong, Fuzhou Tanka in Fujian\n\n"}
