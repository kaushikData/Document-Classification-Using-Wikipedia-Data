He resided at the Bogoroditzkaja convent and was regarded as a miracle worker. He engaged in extensive preaching and biblical studies and is viewed as a notable figure in the pre-Mongol Russia.\n\nThe saint was said to be born either in 1150 or 1172 to nobles; he was orphaned in his childhood and then decided to abandon his fortune to pursue the austere and poor religious life.\n\nHe is described as being a man of stern and militant character who kept the idea of the Last Judgement in the minds of himself and others. He was popular among the faithful as he worked for the sick and the troubled. He was noted for his tenderness with those coming to him for his help and his advice. He was less popular with the other priests who were jealous of his successes. This tension led to several moral and theological charges being brought against him and it led to the local bishop taking action against him which cast a cloud over his character for some time and an order for him to stop preaching. But his withdrawal made him no friends either for there were clerics who kept on viewing him with suspicion.\n\nThe bishop later reopened the case against him and acquitted him against the charges leveled against him while making him the abbot of the smaller and impoverished convent of the Mother of God in the area. He spent the rest of his life there and died there circa 1222. His disciple Ephraem's biographical account of the late saint has survived.\n\nHe is venerated as a saint in both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Paul III canonized him as a saint in 1549.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36687789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36687789", "title": "Abu Taghlib", "text": "Abu Taghlib\n\nFadl Allah Abu Taghlib al-Ghadanfar ʿUddat al-Dawla (), usually known simply by his \"kunya\" as Abu Taghlib, was the third Hamdanid ruler of the Emirate of Mosul, encompassing most of the Jazira.\n\nHis reign was troubled, being marked by conflicts with some of his brothers, antagonism with the various branches of the Buyids for influence in Baghdad, and attacks by the Byzantine Empire under John I Tzimiskes. His relations with the Buyid emir of Iraq, 'Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar, were initially hostile, but the two later concluded an alliance. In 978, the Jazira was occupied by the Buyids of Shiraz under 'Adud al-Dawla, and he fled to the Fatimid-controlled parts of Syria, where he tried to secure the governorship of Damascus, and became involved in local rivalries which resulted in his defeat in battle and execution on 29 August 979.\n\nAbu Taghlib was the eldest son of al-Hasan, better known by his \"laqab\" of Nasir al-Dawla, who had established the Hamdanids as masters of a practically independent emirate encompassing the Jazira and centred on Mosul. Nasir al-Dawla engaged in repeated attempts to gain control over the Abbasid caliphs at Baghdad, but in the end was forced to concede defeat to the more powerful Buyids, recognize their suzerainty and pay them tribute. At the same time, Nasir al-Dawla's younger brother Ali, better known as Sayf al-Dawla, managed to establish his control over northern Syria from his two capitals Aleppo and Mayyafariqin, and through his clashes with the Byzantine Empire quickly overshadowed his brother. However, the last decade of Sayf al-Dawla's rule, until his death in February 967, was marked by heavy military defeats at the hands of the Byzantines, who occupied much of his domains, and internal turmoil.\n\nIt was in this context that Abu Taghlib is first mentioned in 964, when his father had once again been embroiled in a conflict with the Buyids. The army of the Buyid Mu'izz al-Dawla occupied Mosul and Nasir al-Dawla was once again forced to flee to the hill country of the northern Jazira. Abu Taghlib led the resistance against the Buyids, who, unable to maintain themselves there, evacuated Mosul and reached a new agreement with the Hamdanids. Consequently, Nasir al-Dawla was now increasingly eclipsed by his sons, and was deposed outright and exiled in 967, dying in captivity shortly after.\n\nAbu Taghlib, surnamed \"al-Ghadanfar\" (\"The Lion\"), succeeded his father as emir and head of the Jaziran branch of the Hamdanid family, but almost immediately his authority was contested by a younger half-brother, Hamdan. Nasir al-Dawla had entrusted the latter with the governance of Nisibis, Maridin and Rahba shortly before his deposition, and may have intended to name him as his heir over Abu Taghlib. Hamdan was indeed the only son of Nasir al-Dawla to protest his father's deposition, and refused to recognize Abu Taghlib. With the aid of the new Buyid emir of Iraq, 'Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar, Abu Taghlib prevailed over Hamdan, who fled to Baghdad. In addition, Abu Taghlib used the conditions of near-anarchy prevailing in Syria at the time and after Sayf al-Dawla's death to expand his territory at the expense of his cousin, Sa'd al-Dawla. Upon Sayf al-Dawla's death, Abu Taghlib seized Raqqa and Rafiqa, and by 971 he had extended his control over all of Diyar Bakr and Diyar Mudar, once part of Sayf al-Dawla's domain, uniting the entire Jazira under his rule. Sa'd al-Dawla, deprived of his own capital and lacking any power to offer any resistance, tacitly accepted these losses as well as his cousin's suzerainty. As ruler of the Jazira, Abu Taghlib was one of the richest rulers of the region; Ibn Hawkal's descriptions attest to the wealth derived from the many Hamdanid estates, and Ibn Miskawayh, who was tasked with inventorying the family's mountain strongholds after the Buyid dissolution of the Hamdanid emirate in 979, writes of the immense cash reserves stored there.\n\nRelations with the Buyids were initially good, as Abu Taghlib, unlike his father, had no direct claim on Baghdad, and Bakhtiyar himself was too preoccupied with affairs in Iraq and elsewhere to focus his attention on the Jazira. However, the Buyid prince offered refuge to Hamdan and other disgruntled members of the Hamdanid clan (including another of Abu Taghlib's brothers, Abu Tahir Ibrahim) and intervened in the Hamdanid family quarrels. Thus in 970 Hamdan was restored in Rahba thanks to Buyid pressure, only to be chased away again in 971. The exiled prince now urged Bakhtiyar to make war on Abu Taghlib: in 973 the Buyids once again occupied Mosul, while Abu Taghlib with his army outflanked them and threatened Baghdad. The conflict ended in a negotiated settlement in 974 that included in its provisions the award of the \"laqab\" of \"ʿUddat al-Dawla\" (\"Instrument of the Dynasty\") to Abu Taghlib by the caliph and the restoration of Hamdan to his domains. During the same period, Abu Taghlib also faced the attacks of the Byzantines, who under Emperor John I Tzimiskes penetrated deep into the Jazira, forcing the Hamdanids to pay tribute. The devastating raids of 972 were partly avenged through the defeat and capture of the Domestic of the Schools Melias at Amid in 973, but in 974 Tzimiskes himself raided the Jazira in retaliation.\nIn 973–975, Abu Taghlib supported Bakhtiyar in his own struggles to safeguard his power. Thus he once again marched on Baghdad during the rebellion of the Turkish military commander, Sabuktakin, although it was the intervention of the Buyid emir of Shiraz, 'Adud al-Dawla, that decided the conflict for Bakhtiyar. As a result of his assistance, in 975 Abu Taghlib secured a revision of the earlier treaty which freed him from the payment of tribute. In 976, following the death of Tzimiskes, Abu Taghlib agreed to support the bid for the Byzantine throne of the rebel general Bardas Skleros, with whom he concluded a treaty whereby the Hamdanid ruler supplied Skleros with light cavalry in exchange for an unspecified marriage agreement.\n\nIn 977, as Bakhtiyar found himself driven from Baghdad by the ambitious 'Adud al-Dawla, he turned again to the Hamdanids for aid. Abu Taghlib agreed to support him in exchange for the handing over of Hamdan, who was promptly executed. Although this secured Abu Taghlib's position in his family, it also brought him to the attention of 'Adud al-Dawla. In May 978, Bakhtiyar and Abu Taghlib were defeated in a battle near Samarra by 'Adud al-Dawla. Bakhtiyar himself was captured and executed at the orders of 'Adud al-Dawla, who then advanced on Mosul. Unlike earlier Buyid expeditions against the Hamdanids, that had failed chiefly because they were unable to sustain themselves in the Jazira, this was far better organized, as 'Adud al-Dawla brought along experienced administrators familiar with the area. The Buyids took Mosul and forced Abu Taghlib to flee to Mayyafariqin and then to the mountains of Armenia; while the Buyids laid siege to Mayyafariqin, he even visited Skleros in Byzantine territory in Anzitene, trying to secure his assistance, but in vain, for Skleros too was hard-pressed by the loyalist general Bardas Phokas. After the fall of Mayyafariqin in 978, Abu Taghlib fled to Rahba, from where he tried in vain to negotiate with 'Adud al-Dawla.\n\nWith the Buyid troops completing their conquest of the Jazira, and unable to seek aid from his cousin Sa'd al-Dawla, who had already acknowledged 'Adud al-Dawla's suzerainty and was under orders to arrest him, Abu Taghlib with his remaining followers crossed the Syrian Desert to the Fatimid-controlled south of Syria. There he became embroiled in the complex power struggles between the Fatimid government and local elites. He endeavoured to gain recognition by the Fatimids as governor of Damascus, but the rebel general al-Qassam, who held the city, repulsed him. Under attack by the Damascenes, and with members of his family starting to desert him, Abu Taghlib moved further south to the region of Lake Tiberias. Abu Taghlib's ambitions and his contacts with the Fatimids now came to threaten the position of Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah, a Tayy chief and ruler of Ramla. Hoping to sow dissension among the Arab tribes of the area and strengthen Fatimid authority, the Fatimid general Fadl now promised Ramla to Abu Taghlib, who openly allied himself with Mufarrij's rivals, the Banu Uqayl, and attacked Ramla in August 979. Fadl's troops, however, came to the aid of Mufarrij, and in the ensuing battle on 29 August Abu Taghlib was taken captive and executed.\n\nThe Jazira remained under Buyid control until 989, when Abu Taghlib's brothers Abu Abdallah Husayn and Abu Tahir Ibrahim, who had submitted to the Buyids, were installed as governors to oppose the power of the Kurdish chieftain Badh, who had taken control of Mosul. In this fight, the two brothers relied upon the Uqaylis; after the defeat of Badh, the Banu Uqayl turned on the Hamdanids and deposed and killed Abu Tahir Ibrahim, establishing the Uqaylid Dynasty as the rulers of the Jazira.\n\n"}

If this theme is read with verse 39 of Surah An-Najm (Laisa lil insani illa ma saa: there is nothing for man but what he has striven for), it becomes plain that in this world the future of man depends on his toil and struggle, effort and striving.\n\nAfter this, man's misunderstanding that he is all in all in this world and that there is no superior power to watch what he does and to call him to account, has been refuted.\n\nThen, taking one of the many moral concepts of ignorance held by man, as an example, it has been pointed out what wrong criteria of merit and greatness he has proposed for himself in the world. The person who for ostentation and display squanders heaps of wealth, not only himself prides upon his extravagances but the people also admire him for it enthusiastically, whereas the Being Who is watching over his deeds, sees by what methods he obtained the wealth and in what ways and with what motives and intention he spent it.\n\nThen Allah says: We have given man the means of knowledge and the faculties of thinking and understanding and opened up before him both the highways of virtue and vice: one way leads down to moral depravity, and it is an easy way pleasing for the self; the other way leads up to moral heights, which is steep like an uphill road, for scaling which man has to exercise self- restraint. It is man's weakness that he prefers slipping down into the abyss to scaling the cliff.\n\nThen, Allah has explained what the steep road is by following which man can ascend to the heights. It is that he should give up spending for ostentation, display and pride and should spend his wealth to help the orphans and the needy, should believe in Allah and His Religion and joining the company of believers should participate in the construction of a society which should fulfill the demands of virtue and righteousness patiently and should be compassionate to the people. The end of those who follow this way is that they would become worthy of Allah's mercies. On the contrary, the end of those who follow the wrong way, is the fire of Hell from which there is no escape.\n\nSayyid Qutb (d. 1966), who was an Egyptian author, Islamist, and leading intellectual of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, surmised the overall theme of \"Surat Al-Lail\" in the introduction to his extensive Quranic commentary, \"Fi Zilal al-Qur'an\" (In the shades of the Qur'an) by saying:\nThis short sūrah touches on a great many facts which are of central importance to human life. Its style is characterized by powerful allusions. Numerous facts of this nature are not easily combined in any form of concise writing except that of the Qur’ān, with its unique ability to hit the right chords with such swift and penetrating strokes.\n\n—Sayid Qutb, \"Fi Zilal al-Qur'an\"\n"}
{"id": "341059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341059", "title": "Amami rabbit", "text": "Amami rabbit\n\nThe Amami rabbit (\"Pentalagus furnessi\"; ), or , also known as the Ryukyu rabbit, is a primitive, dark-furred rabbit which is only found in Amami Ōshima and Toku-no-Shima, two small islands between southern Kyūshū and Okinawa in Kagoshima Prefecture (but actually closer to Okinawa) in Japan. Often called a living fossil, the Amami rabbit is a living remnant of ancient rabbits that once lived on the Asian mainland, where they died out, remaining only on the two small Japanese islands where they live today.\n\nThe amami rabbit feeds on over 29 species of plants, which incorporates 17 species of shrubs and 12 species of herbaceous plants, consuming mostly the sprouts, young shoots and acorns . It also eats nuts and cambium of a wide variety of plant species. It is observed that the amami rabbit also feeds on the bark of stems and twigs of shrub plants. During summer, the amami rabbit primarily feeds on pampas grass, and during winter, they primarily eat the acorns of the pasania tree.\n\nThe Amami rabbit has short feet and hind legs, a somewhat bulky body, and rather large and curved claws used for digging and sometimes climbing. Its ears are significantly smaller compared to those of other hares or rabbits. The pelage is thick, wooly and dark, brown on top and becomes more reddish-brown on the sides. It has heavy, long and very strong claws, being nearly straight on the forefeet and curved on the hindfeet The eyes are also small compared to more common rabbits and hares. The average weight is 2.5–2.8 kg.\n\nThe ideal habitat for these rabbits is in an area between mature and young forests. They use the dense mature forests as protection and for the presence of pampas grass, in the summer, and acorns, in the winter, for their diets. They also use the high density of perennial grasses and herbaceous ground cover in the young forests for their diets during different times of the year. Therefore, the best habitat for them to live in is where they have easy access to both young and mature forests with no obstructions between the two forest types.\n\nUsing fecal pellet counts and resident surveys, the number of rabbits is estimated at 2000–4800 left on Amami Island and 120–300 left on Tokuno Island.\n\nThis species is a nocturnal forest-dweller that reproduces once in late March–May and once in September–December, having one or two young each time. During the day, the mother digs a hole in the ground, for her young to hide in. At night, she opens the entrance to the hole, while watching for predators (such as venomous snakes), and then nurses her young, after which she closes the hole with soil and plant material by thumping on it with her front paws. Amami rabbits sleep during the day in hidden locations, such as caves. They are also noted for having a call similar to that of a pika.\n\nBefore 1921, hunting and trapping were another cause of decline in population numbers. In 1921, Japan declared the Amami rabbit a \"natural monument\" which prevented it from being hunted. Then in 1963, it was changed to a \"special natural monument\" which prevented it from being trapped as well.\n\nHabitat destruction, such as forest clearing for commercial logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, is the most detrimental activity on the distribution of these rabbits. Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.\n\nThe Amami rabbit also faces huge threats from the invasive predators, being a major cause for the decline in population size. On the island of Amami, the small Indian mongoose (\"Herpestes javanicus\") was released to control the population of a local venomous snake, and its numbers have increased dramatically. This mongoose, along with feral cats and dogs, are outpreying the Amami rabbit.\n\nIn July 2008, the Amami Rangers for nature conservation obtained a photograph of a feral cat carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit is not likely to inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if they can not be increased.\n\nSuggested conservation work for the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on the southern end of Amami, so that area should be protected. Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.\n\nThe Lagomorph Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources proposed a plan of conservation in 1990. In Amami-Oshima Island, the Amami Wildlife Conservation Center of the Ministry of the Environment was established in 1999. It restarted a mongoose eradication program in 2005 and designated the Amami rabbit as endangered in 2004 for Japan.\n\n"}

They are notable for living under strict gender segregation, resulting in two separate societies; the Brotherhood of Badoon (ruled by a \"Brother Royal\") and the Sisterhood of Badoon (ruled by a Queen).\n\nThe Brotherhood live on the planet Moord in the Lomora star system while the Sisterhood reside on the Badoon homeworld of Lotiara (Capella II, also known as \"Swampworld\"), 42.2 light years from Earth.\n\nThe Badoon first appeared in \"Silver Surfer\" #2 and were created by Stan Lee and John Buscema.\n\nThe Badoon are older than the Kree and the Skrulls. There was a natural hatred between the two genders, and they fought each other in long gender wars. The males quickly won, and placed the weaker females in captivity. In time, the males developed technology and abandoned Lotiara, returning only when their mating drive made it necessary. The males became conquerors of worlds, while the females became pacifists, content to remain in peace on their homeworld and ignorant of the males' star-spanning empire.\n\nAmong the Brotherhood's conquest attempts are the Zen Whoberi, and the extra-dimensional world of Polemachus. They have been known to form alliances with the Brood (against the Shi'ar and Earth's superhumans), the Kree (against the Skrulls), and Byrrah of Atlantis. They were also responsible for killing a woman who would have become the universe's greatest peacemaker.\n\nBadoon invasion attempts of Earth have been overcome by the Silver Surfer, Namor, and the New Warriors. They were also opposed by the combined forces of the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and Arkon in order to liberate Arkon's homeworld and prevent an invasion of the Shi'ar empire.\n\nAt the time of the Annihilation Wave the Badoon Empire controlled 37.7% of the Milky Way Galaxy. Despite this, the Badoon are considered a minor species. The time traveler Major Victory warned the Guardians of the Galaxy that they need to take the Badoon seriously, as soon they'll become the greatest military threat in the galaxy.\n\nThe Inhumans and the Kree later form an alliance with the Badoon alongside the Centaurians, the Dire Wraiths, and the Kymellians. They were put through the same experimental procedure so that they cannot be harmed by the Terrigen Mists. The Badoons' procedure had them going through Amphogenesis upon injecting one drop of the diluted water from the dormant Amphogen (a mutagenic substance). The Badoons were present on Earth's moon upon Black Bolt's return and when the prophecy of the four cities is known.\n\nThe Badoons have no powers or abilities.\n\nThe Brotherhood are capable of faster-than-light space travel and also possess personal cloaking technology. They employ a hand-held particle gun called the \"basic weapon.\" Although males typically wear minimal clothing, some soldiers wear an explosive \"frag-thong\" that destroys approximately ten surrounding enemies once a Badoon is shot down.\n\nThere is also a large, muscular cyborg-like being sometimes used in personal combat called the \"Monster of Badoon.\" The Badoon will bolster their forces with Zom soldiers: the corpses of victims turned into cyborg warriors.\n\n\nThe Brotherhood are most closely associated with the Guardians of the Galaxy's 'Multiverse' timeline of Earth-691. In this reality, Earth fought a war with them in the 30th century until both Earth and its solar system colonies were conquered in the year 3007, and many races were nearly all wiped out. The Guardians of the Galaxy were made up of different species, and put together by Starhawk. The human Michael Korvac, joined the Badoon and became a cyborg. The Solar System was liberated by the intervention of the Sisterhood in 3014. Almost all information about the Sisterhood comes from the Guardians of the Galaxy's encounters with them in this timeline. Recent stories as of 2008 have depicted the Sisterhood who exist in the Earth-616 reality as being as warlike as the Brotherhood, suggesting that this origin story does not apply to the \"mainstream\" version of the Sisterhood.\n\nIn the Earth-93112 timeline, the Badoon Ecclaw was one of the last survivors of the Intergalactic Alliance destroyed by the Magus, who is best known as the mentor of the superhero Maxam.\n\nIn another timeline, the Badoon were conquered by Kang.\n\n\n"}

Housed in the Dumbarton Oaks collection, United States, the figurine is considered by several scholars to be a pre-Columbian artwork, while others believe it was made in modern times, possibly in the 19th century. The figurine measures 20.2 cm in height.\n\nBirthing figures, while common in Colonial Mexican manuscripts, are rare in Aztec three-dimensional art. Women, however, occupied a prominent position in the Aztec mythology.\n\nEarly mentions of the figurine come from Ernest-Théodore Hamy, who first saw it in a Paris antique store. The figurine was later bought by French obstetrician and collector Alban Ribemont-Dessaignes. In 1947, the figure was acquired by Robert Woods Bliss, the founder of Dumbarton Oaks.\n\nThe first scholarly article about the figurine was written by Ernest-Théodore Hamy in 1899 and called it \"absolutely unique in the history of Mexican art\". In 1906, Hamy published an article in the \"Journal de la Société des Américanistes\" writing that the figurine is of pre-Columbian Mexican origin and represents the Aztec goddess Ixcuina, also known as Tlazolteotl. Scholars such as Pal Kelemen, Miguel Covarrubias, John Alden Mason, Michael D. Coe and Jeffrey Quilter also considered the figurine to be authentic. Others, such as Claude-François Baudez and Esther Pasztory, question the figurine's stylistic features. The authenticity was also questioned on the basis of technical virtuosity compared to the technical limitations of pre-Columbian artisans. According to Jane MacLaren Walsh, \"the essential nature of the sculpture is almost completely anomalous with regard to the accepted canon of Mexica art, and does not in fact resemble any other Mesoamerican art form\" and \"the choice of stone, the complicated carving in the round, the birthing position, the facial expression of the mother, the somewhat grotesque realism, the lack of iconographic detail all point to a highly idiosyncratic work\".\n\n"}

The field of extended cognition focuses upon the processes involved in this creation, and subsumes these processes as part of consciousness. Which is no longer confined to the brain or body, but involves interaction with the environment. At a 'low' level, like motor learning and haptic perception, the body is involved in cognition, but there is a 'high' level where cultural factors play a role. This view of cognition is sometimes referred to as enaction to emphasise the role of interplay between the organism and its environment and the feedback processes involved in developing an awareness of, and a reformation of, the environment.

{"id": "24801892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24801892", "title": "Folate targeting", "text": "Folate targeting\n\nFolate targeting is a method utilized in biotechnology for drug delivery purposes. This Trojan Horse process, which was created by Drs. Christopher P. Leamon and Philip S. Low, involves the attachment of the vitamin, folate (folic acid), to a molecule/drug to form a \"folate conjugate\". Based on the natural high affinity of folate for the folate receptor protein (FR), which is commonly expressed on the surface of many human cancers, folate-drug conjugates also bind tightly to the FR and trigger cellular uptake via endocytosis. Molecules as diverse as small radiodiagnostic imaging agents to large DNA plasmid formulations have successfully been delivered inside FR-positive cells and tissues.\n\nFolic acid (FA, folate or vitamin B), is a vital nutrient required by all living cells for nucleotide biosynthesis and for the proper metabolic maintenance of 1-carbon pathways. Aside from its cofactor role for intracellular enzymes, FA also displays high affinity for the folate receptor (FR), a glycosylphosphatidyinositol-linked protein that captures its ligands from the extracellular milieu and transports them inside the cell via a non-destructive, recycling endosomal pathway. The FR is also a recognized tumor antigen/biomarker. Because of this, diagnostic and therapeutic methods which exploit the FR’s function are being developed for cancer.\n\nThe FR is an emerging therapeutic target for diagnosis and treatment of cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases. Expression of the FR is selectively upregulated on certain malignant cells and activated macrophages. Overexpression of the FR on these types of cells is clinically significant because they designate areas where the physiological symptoms of disease are most extensive. The malignant cells indicate the presence of tumors associated with ovarian, lung, breast, kidney, brain, endometrial, and colon cancer. Macrophages become activated in chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and most other inflammatory diseases.\n\nFrom a mechanistic perspective, the FR functions to concentrate exogenous ligands (e.g. folates and folate-drug conjugates) into the cell cytosol by endocytosis. The term endocytosis refers to the process whereby the plasma membrane invaginates and eventually forms a distinct intracellular compartment. The endocytic vesicles (endosomes) rapidly become acidified to allow the FR to release its ligand. Afterwards, the empty FR returns to the cell surface where it can participate in another round of ligand-mediated endocytosis.\n\nThe discovery of vitamin-mediated drug targeting in plants led to the hypothesis that folate-targeted therapies could be of clinical use. After proteins covalently bonded to biotin were successfully transported into plant cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, a similar technique was attempted with folate and animal cells. Targeted drug therapy is advantageous because it deposits the drug at the specific location where it can be most useful in treating the disease. Similarly, folate-targeted imaging therapy helps visualize areas where the FR is expressed at higher levels. With greater control over where exogenous agents are delivered, diagnostic and treatment therapies are more effective and cause fewer side effects.\n\nSpecificity of folate conjugates for the FR has been shown by competition tests with free folate. When this ligand, known to bind the FR, is added in excess of the folate conjugate, it outcompetes the conjugate, indicating that the folate conjugate specifically binds the FR, and not other receptors, in the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Addition of an enzyme that frees the folate receptor from the cell membrane and addition of antibodies to the FR also reverse the internalization of folate conjugates, providing further evidence that folate conjugates bind the FR with specificity.\n\nWhile some drugs and radioimaging agents are delivered to cells as folate conjugates in a one-to-one folate-to-conjugate ratio, folate-targeted liposomes allow for the delivery of larger amounts of chemotherapeutic agents. In this technique, drug particles are enveloped in a plasma membrane-bound vesicle. Folate is attached to polyethylene glycol bound to the phosphate heads of membrane phospholipids, thus directing the liposomes to FRs of tumor cells, by which they are engulfed.\n\nElevated expression of the FR occurs in many human malignancies, especially when associated with aggressively growing cancers. Recently, it was proposed that this relationship may possibly be used for prognostic purposes. Non-mucinous ovarian cancer (the majority of ovarian cancers) was the first tumor type to be associated with FR \"over-expression\", and it was later shown that this antigen was identical to that found on KB tumor cells and in placental tissue. Several studies confirmed that ~80-90% of ovarian tumors over-express the FR. Other gynecological cancers also over-express the receptor as well as pediatric ependymal brain tumors, mesothelioma, and breast, colon, renal and lung tumors. The FR may also be found associated with cancer, particularly when related to myeloid leukemia and perhaps head and neck carcinomas. Taken together, the total number of tumors that express the FR is very large; therefore, FR-targeted strategies could have significant impact on cancer treatment for patients diagnosed with FR-positive disease.\n\nThe FR is expressed on many different types of malignant tissues and in large quantities. But, not all human cancers within a particular indication will express the FR. Because novel FR-targeted therapies are now being tested clinically, having the ability to screen patients for FR-positive disease could certainly increase the efficiency of and decrease the time for clinical investigations of these novel agents.\n\nCurrently, there are two principal methods that have been utilized for assessing a patient’s \"FR status\". These include an invasive tissue-based immunohistochemical assay, and a non-invasive radiodiagnostic approach. The latter method is now being tested clinically using Tc-EC20.\n\nTo date, four distinct FA-drug conjugates have entered clinical trials for the treatment of cancer:\n\n\"Vintafolide (EC145)\" represents a novel water-soluble FA conjugate of the powerful microtubule destabilizing agent, desacetylvinblastine monohydrazide (DAVLBH; a derivative of the natural product, vinblastine). EC145 was found to produce marked anti-tumor effect against well-established, subcutaneous FR-positive tumor xenografts using well tolerated regimens. EC145 also represents the first FA-drug conjugate to be evaluated in clinical trials, and it is currently (2009) being tested in a multi-national randomized Phase 2b trial in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil).\n\n\"EC0225\" represents the \"first in class\" multi-drug, FA-targeted agent to be reported. It is a molecule constructed with a single FA moiety and extended by a hydrophilic peptide-based spacer that is, in turn, linked to \"Vinca\" alkaloid and mitomycin units via 2 distinct disulfide-containing linkers. Animals bearing well-established human tumor xenografts were found to completely respond to EC0225 therapy with dosing regimens that were approximately 3-fold less intensive to that required for EC145. A Phase 1 trial for EC0225 is in progress.\n\n\"BMS-753493\" is a molecule born from a collaboration between scientists at Endocyte Inc. and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS). It represents a FA conjugate that was constructed with a semi-synthetic analog of Epothilone A. BMS-753493 is currently being evaluated for safety and efficacy in Phase 2 clinical trials sponsored by BMS.\n\n\"EC0489\" is the latest folate-targeted chemotherapeutic to enter clinical trials sponsored by Endocyte. This molecule is actually a derivative of EC145 (see above) that was designed to have limited non-specific clearance properties through the liver. By reducing hepatic clearance, less drug will transit through the biliary excretion route; as a consequence, less off-target toxicities (predicted from preclinical tests) are expected.\n\nMacrophages are the human body’s first line of defense against invading pathogens. Normally, they circulate in the bloodstream in a dormant state, but at a site of inflammation due to injury or autoimmune disease, they become activated, changing shape and expressing different cell surface markers. The upregulated expression of the FR makes activated macrophages a useful tool in folate-targeted therapy. Activated, TNF-alpha producing macrophages express the beta isoform of the FR, and they are targetable with folate conjugates \"in vivo\". For example, Tc-EC20 was reported to concentrate in the livers, spleens and arthritic extremities of adjuvant-induced arthritic rats via a folate-dependent mechanism. Development of folate-drug conjugates for inflammation therapy is underway. It is expected that ailments which harbor activated macrophages (such as arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease) may someday be treatable with folate-targeted medicines.\n\n"}

Howell Flournoy (October 21, 1891 – December 14, 1966), was the sheriff of Caddo Parish based in Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana, from 1940 until his death in office. His 26-year tenure as the Caddo Parish sheriff has yet to be surpassed.\n\nA native of Greenwood in southwestern Caddo Parish, Flournoy was the son of James Patteson \"Pat\" Flournoy, Sr., the Caddo Parish sheriff from 1906–1916, who had previously been the Shreveport municipal auditor, parish tax assessor, and coroner, at a time when medical examiners in Louisiana need not have been physicians. Flournoy was the paternal grandson of 19th century Sheriff Alonzo Flournoy.\n\nFlournoy was educated in public schools in Shreveport and thereafter attended an unnamed business college. A Louisiana National Guardsman, Flournoy was a United States Army veteran of World War I, with assignment on the Mexican border. He was also as an instructor in a machine gun school at Camp Hancock, Georgia, and was commissioned a lieutenant.\n\nAt seventeen, Flournoy became a deputy in the Caddo Parish sheriff's department, a position that he held from 1913–1928. He was hence a deputy under his father from 1913 to 1916, as were two of his brothers, James Flournoy, Jr., and George A. Flournoy. From 1928 to 1940, J. Howell Flournoy was a deputy Caddo Parish tax collector. In 1940, Flournoy was elected sheriff to succeed Thomas Roland Hughes in the same political cycle which brought Sam Houston Jones of Lake Charles to the governorship. Hughes, known for his arrest of the controversial blues musician Lead Belly, had succeeded J. Pat Flournoy as sheriff in 1916. As sheriff, J. Howell Flournoy in 1940 organized the Caddo Parish Selective Service board and trained an internal security group in Shreveport during World War II. He spearheaded a measure to establish a pension and relief fund for sheriff's department employees. From 1950 until his death, except for one year, Flournoy headed the Louisiana Sheriff's Pension and Relief Fund.\n\nFlournoy often received commendations for his work in law enforcement from J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The defunct \"Shreveport Journal\" afternoon newspaper referred to Flournoy, accordingly, \"A well-known conservative and a spokesman for patriotism, Sheriff Flournoy spent his entire adult life striving to improve his department in all fields of duty and speaking out against anything or any group which he felt posed a threat to Americanism. The sheriff and his department, ranked among the best and were often copied by other similar law agencies . . . he was also recognized for his well-known work with youth, including his Junior Rifle Program, nationally acclaimed.\n\nFlournoy was originally a segregationist though he hired the first African American deputies in Caddo Parish. When State Senator William M. Rainach of Claiborne Parish telephoned Flournoy to inform him that one of the African-American deputies had spoken in support of racial integration, Flournoy dismissed the man. In 1964, Flournoy, a Democrat, broke party lines to endorse the Republican presidential nominee, then U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona. Joining Flournoy in support of Goldwater, who spoke in Shreveport on September 17, were former Governors Sam Jones and Robert F. Kennon, State Senator Jackson B. Davis of Shreveport, Louisiana Secretary of State Wade O. Martin, Jr., Lieutenant Governor C. C. \"Taddy\" Aycock of Franklin in St. Mary Parish, and the then mayor of Monroe, W. L. \"Jack\" Howard.\n\nIn 1947, Flournoy hired Harold M. Terry (1925-2016) as a deputy, later the manager of the Junior Rifle Program and an expert marksman. Terry himself was sheriff from 1976 to 1980.\n\nIn 1952, Flournoy hired George W. D'Artois as a deputy sheriff, a post he held for nine years. D'Artois stepped down in 1962 to run successfully for Shreveport public service commissioner, a position abolished in 1978 under the mayor-council city charter.\n\nIn 1965, Flournoy was named the \"Outstanding Conservative of the Year\" by the Americanism Forum of Shreveport. He received other honors from the Progressive Men's Club and the American Society of Safety Engineers. Flournoy was affiliated with the American Legion, Lions International, Chamber of Commerce, Order of the Eastern Star, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Masonic lodge, and the Shriners, a group which in the late 1920s located one of its children's hospital in Shreveport. He was president of the Caddo Rifle and Pistol Club from 1956 until his death. He was the first marshal of the Holiday in Dixie festival held each April in Shreveport.\n\nFlournoy was married to the former Mary Bridges, a native of Morehouse Parish near Monroe, who moved to Shreveport with her family in 1913. The Flournoys had one daughter, Georgia Lou Flournoy Hodgson, who was living in Kuwait at the time of her father's death.\n\nFlournoy was a member of the First First Presbyterian Church of Shreveport until he helped to organize and then became an elder in the newer Broadmoor Presbyterian Church in the Broadmoor neighborhood of Shreveport.

Fifty-four members of its crew of 66 were beheaded by the Paiwan aborigines. The remaining 12 crewmen were rescued by Han Chinese and were transferred to Tainan in southern Taiwan. The local Qing Chinese government officials transferred them to Fujian province in mainland China. From there, the Qing government arranged to send them back home.\n\nWhen Japan sought compensation from Qing China, the court rejected the demand on the grounds that the \"wild\"/\"unsubjugated\" aboriginals () were outside its jurisdiction. This open renunciation of sovereignty led to the Taiwan Expedition of 1874 by the Japanese.\n\nThe Meiji government of Japan demanded that the Qing government of China punish leaders of the Taiwanese aborigines responsible for the murders of the Ryukyuan crew. The Japanese foreign minister Soejima Taneomi went to Beijing in June 1873, and was received in an audience by the Tongzhi Emperor (in itself a diplomatic triumph); however, his request for compensation was first rejected because China considered it an internal affair since Taiwan was part of Fujian Province of China and the Ryūkyū Kingdom had a tributary relationship with China. When Soejima Taneomi claimed four of the victims murdered were from Oda Prefecture, present-day Okayama Prefecture, Japan and asked for compensation again, Chinese officials refused him on the grounds that most of the Taiwanese aboriginals were outside effective Chinese control, and were thus sometimes exempt from judicial action. Charles Le Gendre, the French-born American military advisor to the Japanese government, as well as Gustave Emile Boissonade, legal advisor, urged that Japan take the matter into its own hands.\n\nThe Japanese government agreed, and sent an expedition of 3,600 soldiers led by Saigō Tsugumichi in May 1874. The Japanese won a decisive victory at the Battle of Stone Gate on 22 May. Thirty Taiwan tribesmen were either killed or mortally wounded in the battle, and a considerably greater number wounded. Japanese casualties were 6 killed and 30 wounded.\n\nIn November 1874 the Japanese forces withdrew from Taiwan after the Qing government agreed to an indemnity of 500,000 Kuping taels, or about silver. Sir Harry Parkes, the British minister to Japan, characterised this transaction as \"China's willingness to pay to be invaded\".\n\nIn 1875, the Qing authorities unsuccessfully attempted to bring the southeast coastal region of Taiwan under their control, despatching a column of 300 soldiers against the Paiwan. The Chinese troops were ambushed and routed by the Paiwan and their well-armed fighters. 250 Chinese soldiers were killed, and the 50 survivors retreated to Takow (Kaohsiung).\n\nAlthough launched ostensibly to punish the local tribesmen for their murder of 54 Ryukyuan merchants, the 1874 punitive expedition to Taiwan served a number of purposes for Japan's new Meiji government. Japan had for some time begun claiming suzerainty, and later sovereignty, over the Ryūkyū Kingdom, whose traditional suzerain had been China. The expedition demonstrated that China was not in effective control of Taiwan, let alone the Ryukyu Islands. Japan was emboldened to more forcefully assert its claim to speak for the Ryukyuan islanders. The settlement in 1874, brokered by the British, included a reference to Chinese recognition that the Japanese expedition was \"in protection of civilians\", a reference that Japan later pointed towards as Chinese renunciation of its rights over Ryukyu. In 1879 Japan referred the dispute to British arbitration, and the British confirmed Japanese sovereignty over the Ryukyus, a result which was not recognised by China. Nevertheless, Japan used this as the justification for taking \"de facto\" control over Ryukyu, moving the king of Ryukyu to Japan and incorporating Ryukyu as a prefecture of Japan. The ensuing Chinese protest led to the matter being submitted to US President Ulysses S. Grant as arbitrator, during which Japan offered to split Ryukyu between Japan and China. This was refused by China, but a weakened China was unable in practice to stop the Japanese annexation of the Ryukyus.\n\nThe surrendering aborigines were given Japanese flags to fly over their villages that they viewed as a symbol of peace with Japan and protection from rival tribes, however, the Japanese viewed them as a symbol of jurisdiction over the aborigines. The expedition also served as a useful rehearsal for future Japanese imperial ambitions. Taiwan was already being viewed as a potential Japanese colony in some circles in Japan.\n\nDomestically, the action also mollified those within the Meiji government who were pushing for a more aggressive foreign policy, and who were enraged by the government's refusal in 1873 to attack Korea. It is significant that the expedition took place shortly after the Saga Rebellion, and was led by Saigō Jūdō (Saigō Takamori's younger brother) and consisted largely of former Satsuma and Saga \"samurai\".\n\nMore generally, the Japanese incursion into Taiwan in 1874 and the feeble Chinese response was a blatant revelation of Chinese weakness and an invitation to further foreign encroachment in Taiwan. In particular, the success of the Japanese incursion was among the factors influencing the French decision to invade Taiwan in October 1884, during the Sino-French War. The Qing court belatedly attempted to strengthen its hold on Taiwan, and the Chinese imperial commissioner Shen Pao-chen made some improvements to the island's coastal defences during the second half of the 1870s. Further substantial improvements were made by the Chinese governor Liu Ming-ch'uan in the 1880s, in the wake of the French capture of Keelung during the Sino-French War. However, little was done to improve the poor quality of the Qing garrison of Taiwan, and both the French in 1884 and the Japanese in 1895 were able to land successfully in Taiwan.\n\n\n"}

Jordan was interviewed by Pennsylvania State Police twice that day and arrested before sunrise the next morning. The Lawrence County District Attorney's Office initially filed the charges in adult court because that is required in Pennsylvania homicide cases, regardless of a defendant's age. The Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office then took over prosecution of the case. After Brown had spent more than three years in a juvenile detention facility in Erie, Pennsylvania, while Pennsylvania courts deliberated his status, Brown was tried as a juvenile and found guilty of being delinquent by a judge on April 13, 2012. \n\nOn May 8, 2013, the Superior Court vacated the finding of delinquency, citing \"palpable abuse of discretion\" and sent the case back to juvenile court.\n\nBrown could have faced a life sentence without parole if he had been tried and convicted for murder as an adult, but he faced custody in a secure juvenile detention center until he reached the age of 21 because he was only 11 when the crime occurred. He was granted transfer of his case into the juvenile court system.\n\nKenzie Houk was eight months pregnant when she was shot in the back of the head while she was sleeping in bed in their western Pennsylvania farmhouse. Both she and her unborn son died as a result of the attack. Houk's 4-year-old daughter alerted nearby tree cutters roughly 45 minutes after Jordan Brown and Houk's 7-year-old daughter got on a school bus. The state Attorney General prosecutor asserted that Houk was killed by a youth-model Harrington & Richardson 20-gauge shotgun, an Easter gift to Jordan from his father. Pennsylvania State Police found a spent shotgun shell near the path Brown walked with Houk's older daughter to get to their school bus.. He was arrested subsequently.\n\nThe human-rights organization Amnesty International opposed the effort to try Jordan as an adult, citing the mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole penalty as a violation of international law. A petition signed by nearly 4,000 people protested what it termed as denial of Brown's fifth and sixth amendment rights.\n\nOn weekends Jordan hunted alongside his father, Chris Brown, who purchased the youth-sized 20-gauge shotgun that state police believed was the murder weapon. The youth's father did not publicly discuss the case, until after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court exonerated his son nine years later in July 2018.\n\nJordan Brown was initially charged as an adult. Presiding Judge Dominick Motto of the Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, Common Pleas Court initially denied decertification and transfer to juvenile court because Jordan would not admit his involvement in the crime. After Pennsylvania's Superior Court ruled that Judge Motto violated Brown's Fifth Amendment rights, Judge Motto recused himself from the case, and Judge John W. Hodge granted the decertification petition and ruled that Brown should be tried as a juvenile. \n\nThe decertification ruling transferred Brown's case from adult court to Lawrence County's family court division regularly presided over by Judge Hodge, who handled the subsequent juvenile adjudication and dispositional hearings. \n\nThen what became an issue was whether Brown's eventual adjudication hearing (juvenile court trial) should be opened to the public, and whether he should provisionally be released while a decision in that matter was pending. Judge Hodge held that Brown's juvenile hearing would not be open to the public or to the news media. The Pennsylvania Superior Court rejected an appeal by three area newspapers (\"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\", and \"New Castle News\") to overturn Hodge's ruling and open the hearing to the public. After those newspapers decided not to pursue their appeal further, Judge Hodge was directed by another panel of the Superior Court to move swiftly to hold an adjudication hearing. Judge Hodge ruled that Jordan would not be released pending that hearing.\n\nFollowing three days of testimony and legal argument, Judge Hodge issued his ruling on April 13, 2012, that Brown was responsible for first degree murder in the death of 26-year-old Kenzie Houk and of homicide in the death of her unborn male child. Judge Hodge adjudicated the now-15-year-old Jordan Brown to be delinquent (the juvenile court equivalent of a guilty verdict). Judge Hodge would announce Brown's disposition (the equivalent of a juvenile sentence) at a later date. Under Pennsylvania law, an adjudicated juvenile offender cannot be held in custody past his 21st birthday. Brown could be held in a juvenile rehabilitative treatment facility only until he turned 21 in August 2018.\n\nAfter his February 21, 2009 arrest, Jordan was placed in the Lawrence Country Jail, a facility for adults. But authorities transferred him to a juvenile center in March 2009 after his attorneys argued that the adult jail with its three cell blocks couldn't accommodate an 11-year-old boy.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, more than seven years after his arrest, Jordan Brown was released from juvenile custody, two months before his 19th birthday. Judge Hodge put Brown on probation in the custody of an uncle who lived in Ohio, just across the border from Lawrence County. He was to remain on juvenile court probation until he turned 21. His lawyers continued to file appeals in order to have his juvenile conviction (adjudication) overturned. Two years later that resulted in the July 18, 2018 Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling.\n\nOn May 8, 2013, Superior Court, in the second appeal that came before it in this case, ruled that \"the juvenile court committed a palpable abuse of discretion in rendering a ruling that is plainly contrary to the evidence\" and vacated the juvenile court's disposition of delinquency. The ruling in particular objected to the assumption, made by the juvenile court, that no one else but Jordan could have shot Houk. \n\nJudge Hodge issued a juvenile court opinion on April 19, 2015, again finding that Jordan was the individual who killed Kenzie Houk and her unborn child on the morning of February 20, 2009. His disposition order was dated May 18, 2012. And again a third appeal was taken to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. In a split panel decision dated September 1, 2016, titled \"In re J.B. III\", 147 A.3d 1204 (Pa.Super. 2016) (“\"In re J.B. III\"”), the Superior Court affirmed the juvenile court, and rejected claims that the juvenile court had improperly reassessed the evidence and made new credibility determinations in ruling on Brown's post-dispositional motions. \n\nA certiorari request for review was made to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which granted an appeal to consider Brown's claims that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the adjudication of the juvenile court, and that its adjudication was against the weight of the evidence.\n\nOn July 18, 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned his conviction in a 5-0 decision. The two Pennsylvania Supreme Court justices who did not participate had previously ruled in Jordan's favor on his earlier appeal while they had served as judges in the Pennsylvania Superior Court. The justices attacked the evidence as insufficient and said that the juvenile trial evidence pointing to a shotgun in Brown's bedroom as the murder weapon supported an equally-reasonable conclusion that it was not the murder weapon. Justice Debra Todd wrote the Court's opinion and noted, \"The Commonwealth’s evidence was, therefore, insufficient as a matter of law to overcome Appellant’s presumption of innocence, and the juvenile court’s adjudication of his delinquency for these serious crimes must be reversed.\" The last words of the opinion then ordered that \"Appellant is discharged.\" Double jeopardy has attached under the Fifth Amendment, and Brown, now 21, cannot be retried.\n"}

He studied fine art and philosophy at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Cornell University and Columbia University, where he studied with Arthur Danto while serving as the archivist to the minimalist composer La Monte Young. From 1979, he exhibited his work in New York City, primarily at Galerie Richard, Brooke Alexander Gallery and Universal Concepts Unlimited. He has also solo exhibited in Berlin, Paris, Chicago, Cologne, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Aalst, Belgium, Youngstown, Senouillac, Lund, Toulouse, Turin, Arles and Munich.\n\nHis work in the early 1980s chiefly consisted of postminimalist gray graphite drawings that were often photomechanically enlarged. During that period he was associated with the artist group Colab and helped establish the non-profit cultural space ABC No Rio. In 1983 he co-founded the avant-garde electronic art music audio project Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine. In 1984, Nechvatal began work on an opera called \"\" (1984-6) with the no wave musical composer Rhys Chatham.\n\nHe began using computers to make \"paintings\" in 1986 and later, in his signature work, began to employ computer viruses. These \"collaborations\" with viral systems positioned his work as an early contribution to what is increasingly referred to as a post-human aesthetic.\n\nFrom 1991–1993 he was artist-in-residence at the Louis Pasteur Atelier in Arbois, France and at the Saline Royale/Ledoux Foundation's computer lab.There he worked on \"The Computer Virus Project\", which was an artistic experiment with computer viruses and computer animation. He exhibited at Documenta 8 in 1987.\n\nIn 1999 Nechvatal obtained his Ph.D. in the philosophy of art and new technology concerning immersive virtual reality at Roy Ascott's Centre for Advanced Inquiry in the Interactive Arts (CAiiA), University of Wales College, Newport, UK (now the Planetary Collegium at the University of Plymouth). There he developed his concept of viractualism, a conceptual art idea that strives \"to create an interface between the biological and the technological.\" According to Nechvatal, this is a new topological space.\n\nIn 2002 he extended his experimentation into viral artificial life through a collaboration with the programmer Stephane Sikora of music2eye in a work called the \"Computer Virus Project II\", inspired by the a-life work of John Horton Conway (particularly Conway's Game of Life), by the general cellular automata work of John von Neumann, by the genetic programming algorithms of John Koza and the auto-destructive art of Gustav Metzger.\n\nIn 2005 he exhibited \"Computer Virus Project II\" works (digital paintings, digital prints, a digital audio installation and two \"live\" electronic virus-attack art installations) in a solo show called \"cOntaminatiOns\" at Château de Linardié in Senouillac, France. In 2006 Nechvatal received a retrospective exhibition entitled \"Contaminations\" at the Butler Institute of American Art's Beecher Center for Arts and Technology.\n\nDr. Nechvatal has also contributed to digital audio work with his noise music \"viral symphOny\", a collaborative sound symphony created by using his computer virus software at the Institute for Electronic Arts at Alfred University. \"viral symphOny\" was presented as a part of \"nOise anusmOs\" in New York in 2012. In 2016, a limited edition CD recording of his sex farce poetry book \"Destroyer of Naivetés\" was released on Entr'acte label under the name of Cave Bacchus. Cave Bacchus is Nechvatal, Black Sifichi and Rhys Chatham.\n\nIn 2013, Nechvatal showed work in \"Noise\", an official collateral show of the \"55th Venice Biennale of Art\", that was based on his book \"Immersion Into Noise\".\n\nFrom 1999 to 2013, Nechvatal taught art theories of immersive virtual reality and the viractual at the School of Visual Arts in New York City (SVA). A book of his collected essays entitled \"Towards an Immersive Intelligence: Essays on the Work of Art in the Age of Computer Technology and Virtual Reality (1993–2006)\" was published by Edgewise Press in 2009. Also in 2009, his book \"Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances\" was published. In 2011, his book \"Immersion Into Noise\" was published by Open Humanities Press in conjunction with the University of Michigan Library's Scholarly Publishing Office. In 2014 he published (as editor) a book and CD/cassette tape with Punctum Books and Punctum Records on the noise music artist Minóy and in 2015 he published with Punctum Books a collection of his farcical erotic poetry entitled \"Destroyer of Naivetés\". Since 2013, Nechvatal has regularly been publishing his art criticism as the Paris correspondent for Hyperallergic blogazine.\n\nJoe Lewis wrote:\n\nViractualism is an art theory concept developed by Nechvatal in 1999) from the Ph.D. research Nechvatal conducted in the philosophy of art and new technology concerning immersive virtual reality at Roy Ascott's Centre for Advanced Inquiry in the Interactive Arts (CAiiA), University of Wales College, Newport, UK (now the Planetary Collegium at the University of Plymouth). There he developed his concept of the viractual, which strives to create an interface between the biological and the virtual. It is central to Nechvatal's work as an artist.\n\nNechvatal suggests that viractualism may be an entrainment/égréore conception helpful in defining our now third-fused inter-spatiality which is forged from the meeting of the virtual and the actual. - a concept close to the military's augmented reality, which is the use of transparent displays worn as see-through glasses on which computer data is projected and layered.\n\nThe basis of the viractual conception is that virtual producing computer technology has become a noteworthy means for making and understanding contemporary art and that this brings artists to a place where one finds the emerging of the computed (the virtual) with the uncomputed corporeal (the actual). This amalgamate - which tends to contradict some central techno clichés of our time - is what Nechvatal calls the viractual.\nDigitization is a key metaphor for viractuality in the sense that it is the elementary translating procedure today. Nechvatal thinks that in every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest the art practice away from conformisms that are about to overcome it.\n\n\n"}

The daughter and heir of Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland, she was known as the richest woman in Britain outside of the royal family. She married first George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, the favourite, and possibly lover, of King James I of England; and secondly, she married the Irish peer Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim.\n\nLady Katherine Manners was the only daughter of Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland, by his first wife, Frances Knyvet (d. before 26 November 1605), widow of Sir William Bevill of Killigarth or Kilkhampton, Cornwall, and third daughter and coheir of Sir Henry Knyvet of Charlton, Wiltshire, by Elizabeth Stumpe, the daughter of Sir James Stumpe of Bromham, Wiltshire.\n\nKatherine Manners was selected by the formidably ambitious Mary Villiers, Countess of Buckingham, to marry her son, George Villiers. However, Manners was a strict Roman Catholic, and the King refused to allow Villiers to marry her (almost the only occasion when he did not give the Villiers family whatever they asked for). In addition to this, the Earl of Rutland refused to accept the Countess of Buckingham’s demands for his daughter’s dowry. Manners converted to Protestantism, to satisfy the Villiers family, which almost caused her father to call off the marriage. Invited to visit the Countess of Buckingham, Katherine was forced to spend the night due to an attack of illness. Believing his daughter’s honor to be compromised, the Earl of Rutland refused to receive her back, and demanded that George Villiers marry her immediately. At this Villiers refused to marry her, but did a few weeks later, on 16 May 1620.\n\nThe Duchess of Buckingham was one of the few women of rank of the time whose gentleness and womanly tenderness, devotion and purity of life, were conspicuous in the midst of the almost universal corruption and immorality of the Court. No scandal was ever breathed against her name, and the worst that was ever said of her was that by her influence she at one time nearly persuaded her husband to become a Roman Catholic, she herself having returned to her own faith soon after her marriage.\n\nShe was the mother of Mary Villiers, Duchess of Richmond and of George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham (who inherited her title as 20th Baron de Ros). Katherine's first husband, Buckingham, was murdered in 1628 by John Felton. Upon the death of her father in 1632, without male heirs, she succeeded suo jure to the ancient barony of de Ros. In 1635 she married Randal McDonnell, Earl of Antrim, and went to live at Dunluce Castle, County Antrim, Ireland. Following the Catholic uprising in Ulster in 1641 the MacDonnell family moved south to Wexford, then Waterford, where Katherine died in 1649.\n\n"}

He was assaulted by a group of on-duty police officers after being arrested for disorderly conduct at a bar in Houston's Mexican-American East End neighborhood. The officers convicted for the death of Torres, at the state level, received minimal sentencing; 1 year probation and a $1 fine. Torres' murder and sentencing sparked community outrage and lead to multiple community protests, with one gathering escalating to a riot. His death lead to advocacy based and HPD official's negotiations leading to the addition of policies addressing racial relations.\n\nAfter Torres' arrest at the bar, the officers took him to the city jail for booking. But, he was struck so brutally that authorities refused to book him into the jail. Instead the police officers were ordered, by a supervisor, to take Torres to a local hospital for immediate medical treatment. The officers did not comply with the supervisor's order. Three days later, on Mother's Day, Sunday, May 8, 1977 his dead body was found severely beaten and floating in the Buffalo Bayou, a creek on the outskirts of downtown Houston.\n\nTerry W. Denson and Steven Orlando two of the arresting officers were charged with murder following the discovery of Torres' body. Three other officers were fired from the HPD by Police Chief B.G. Bond, but no criminal charges were brought against the fired officers. A rookie officer who was present at the scenes of Torres' torture and drowning was a key witness for the prosecution. Denson and Orlando were convicted for Torres' death and found guilty of negligent homicide (a misdemeanor), sentenced to one year of probation and a one dollar fine. The all white jury minimized criminal convictions and sentencing sparked community outrage leading to multiple protests and the 1978 Moody Park Riot. The investigation of Torres' murder proved controversial. Following the State of Texas convictions of the two former officers, the Torres case was reviewed at the federal level by the U.S. Department of Justice. Which led to three of the officer's federal convictions, for violating Torres' civil rights.\n\nTorres' murder generated significant newspaper articles across the United States, while national televised mainstream media has no history of 'special' reports nor any episodes reporting the circumstances leading to his murder. Newspaper outlets initially focusing on his assault and drowning soon turned their attention to the historic racism, lack of HPD over watch and the reoccurring absence of state and federal investigations.\n\nTorres' murder lead to a locally produced, 30-40 minute documentary entitled \"The Case of Joe Campos Torres\" revealing the murderous event and the repeated history of police misconduct in Houston. The year following his death, a poetic song by vocalist and activist Gil Scott-Heron, titled \"Poem for José Campos Torres\" was created reflecting the struggles of racism and police criminal actions.\n\nTorres was born in a Houston barrio and was raised within poverty. Unfortunately, he only achieved an eighth-grade education level. A side effect of the poverty, he experienced, led to his constant struggle with his social demeanor.\n\nAccording to family and friends, his dream was to run and own a karate school. He wanted to open the school near his East End Houston neighborhood, allowing him to teach young ones the art of self-defense. To pursue his dream, he realized that he needed a General Education Diploma (GED), a driver's license and a job as a lineman with a telephone company.\n\nRichard Vargas, Torres' longtime friend, said that when Torres was 23 he was still lost emotionally and was fighting a sporadic problem with alcohol. Torres would occasionally become very intoxicated; friends and family say this would trigger his aggression, in wanting to fight. Torres' younger brothers, Gilbert, 20 and Ray, 16 acknowledged that Torres had an occasional problem with alcohol abuse. \"Alcohol really got to him sometimes.\" Vargas said, \"Sometimes when he drank a lot he wanted to fight . . . I didn't like to be around Joe when he was drinking. When he got drunk, he'd start practicing his karate. He'd yell and kick and punch at the air.\" When Torres was a teenager he got into a lot of fights, but had confided with Vargas and told him he knew the fighting would not get him anywhere.\n\nTorres' father, José Luna Torres Jr., 46, said his son spent two years in the United States Army (U.S. Army). During his military service, he was accepted and undergoing Army Ranger training at Fort Bragg North Carolina. While in ranger training, he was separated from the service in September 1976, under a 'general discharge.' It is reported his abuse of alcohol and anger outbursts are what ultimately led to his early release from the U.S. Army. His brother Gilbert said, \"Before the service, Joe was bum and a drifter, but after he got out he really cut down on the drinking . . . The normal Joe was different from the drunk Joe.\" He said, \"The drunk Joe got rowdy easy and he [take] things the wrong way sometimes.\"\n\nJust two weeks before his death, Torres found employment as a glass contractor earning $2.75 an hour. Vargas said, Torres had difficulty staying employed since his discharge from the U.S. Army. He said Torres resented his restriction to tedious, low paying jobs due to his low education level and nominal military skills. Even though Torres had received, while in the military, training as a telecommunication's lineman not having his GED and a driver's license were barriers to employment with a potential telecommunications provider.\n\nVargas said, Torres' true passions were physical fitness and the art of karate. After his return from the U.S. Army he was working to receive a black belt (expert) rating in karate. In addition to his progress in karate, he also under went weight training and jogged, frequently attaching weights to his feet.\n\nTorres had been arrested for disorderly conduct at a bar in Houston's predominantly Hispanic East End neighborhood. The six police officers who responded took Torres to a spot called \"The Hole\" next to the Buffalo Bayou and beat him. The officers then took Torres to the city jail, who refused to process him due to his injuries. They were ordered to take him to Ben Taub Hospital, but instead of doing so, the officers brought him back to the banks of Buffalo Bayou and pushed him into the water. Torres's body was found two days later.\n\nOfficers Terry W. Denson and Steven Orlando were tried on state murder charges. They were convicted of negligent homicide and received one year of probation and a $1 fine. Denson, Orlando and fired officer Joseph Janish were later convicted of federal civil rights violations in 1978, and served nine months in prison.\n\nOn the one year anniversary of José Campos Torres' murder a riot was started at Moody Park located in Houston's Near Northside neighborhood. The riot broke out on the evening of Saturday, May 7, 1978 at approximately 7:30 pm, once a fiesta event ended at the park. Between five and six thousand people attended the celebration.\n\nPolice arrived at the park in response to a call for an incident of disorderly conduct. It remains unclear on how the riot started. Some reports reflect that the officers were making a few arrests and this is when people in the event began yelling, \"No you are not taking them\" and \"You'll kill them the way you killed José Campos Torres\". The crowd's initial yelling immediately lead people to begin chanting in unison \"Justice for Joe Torres\" \"Viva Joe Torres\" and \"A Chicano's life is worth more than a dollar!\" The crowd then began throwing bottles and rocks at the officers.\n\nThe Fulton Village shopping center's stores at 2900 Fulton street, were looted and set on fire. Abe Weiner, an owner of a department store in the shopping center, said it took the fire department over an hour to respond to his emergency 9-1-1 call for help. Three large buildings and two smaller ones in the shopping center were looted and stripped by fires. The rioting escalated to over a area adjacent to Moody Park. A total of six stores and one gasoline station were set on fire.\n\nOfficers were promptly deployed in riot gear to try and control the gathering of approximately 1,500 people according to police (other estimates reflect 150-300) who took part in the riot. Some rioters had flipped cars over and set them on fire, fourteen of the eighteen smashed and burned cars were police cars. The property damage of businesses and police vehicles reached $500,000. At least 28 people were taken into custody after the violence started in the predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood. The incident and all the fires were finally under control at 3:00 am.\n\nHouston police officer Tommy A. Britt suffered a broken leg when hit by a car while trying to close off one of the streets involved in the riot. The driver Rogelio Castillo did not pull over, but was apprehended a few blocks away from the incident. The first news reporters to arrive at the scene were KPRC-TV reporter Jack Cato, and reporter/photographer Phil Archer. Both were beaten and stabbed. Cato suffered a punctured lung from a stab wound in the lower back. Archer was hit in the face with a brick and then stabbed in the left hip while lying unconscious on the pavement. Rioters attempted to smash the camera he was carrying. It was later recovered, badly damaged. Cato managed to bring out the video shot during the attack which shows some of the rioters surrounding a burning Houston Fire Department ambulance supervisor's car. The riot's violence left a total of five police officers, two news personnel and eight rioters injured and hospitalized. None of the fifteen hospitalized people died due to their injuries.\n\nAuthor Dwight Watson dedicated the chapter \"The Storm Clouds of Change: The Death of José Campos Torres and the Emergence of Triracial Politics in Houston\" in the book \"Race and the Houston Police Department, 1930–1990 A Change Did Come\". The chapter covers the impact of Torres' murder on society and changes in Houston's policing policies.\n\nVocalist and activist Gil Scott-Heron, known as the \"Godfather of Rap\" and for his sociology charged spoken word performances in the '70s. Scott-Heron's best-known recording is the 1971 released \"The Revolution Will Not be Televised\", this artwork characterizes unashamed consumerism.\n\nScott-Heron's artistry based on self-fortitude and resentment of racism spanned across racial cultures and was popular among both African-Americans and Latinos. In 1978, the year following Torres' murder, he targeted community awareness of the murder and created a poetic song focusing on America's systemic abuse of Asian-Americans, African-Americans and Hispanics in the heartfelt \"Poem for José Campos Torres.\" The song was released as track 4 of the album titled; \"The Mind of Gil Scott-Heron.\"\n\nScott-Heron saw Torres as a brother and made his familial tie to Torres in the lyrics, here is a quote from the song:\n\nCharanga Cakewalk is the stage name for Michael Ramos, a self-described Latino Chicano Mexican who is also a citizen of the world. Ramos, from Austin, TX, is an instrumental artist who passes a distinguishing sound of Latino music onto the next generation of artistry. Ramos has played numerous instruments in studios and on-tours for John Mellencamp, Patty Griffin, Los Lonely Boys, Paul Simon and multiple notable artist. His artwork is self-styled as Cumbia-Tronic that soars between absorbed Electronic Dance and cultivated genres of Cumbia, Ranchera, Folklorica, and Garage Rock.\n\nIn March 2006, Charanga Cakewalk released the album \"Chicano Zen\". The album has multiple instrumental songs, track 11 the closing song is the instrumental titled: \"El Ballad de José Campos Torres\", with a synth, accordion and piano drift inspired by the life of Torres:\n\nIn 2014 Nuño Records published, via SoundCloud, the song \"Moody Park Riot (José Campos Torres)\" written by Juan Nuño performed by Jesse James at Houston, TX. The lyrics depict Torres' beating and drowning along with events tied to the 1978 Moody Park Riot.\n\nArt Browning hosted a television interview with Torres' little sister Janie Torres. The episode, produced by Green Watch Television (GWTV), is titled: \"Joe Campos Torres, 40 years ago\", first aired: Wednesday, April 26, 2017, duration: 24 min. When Browning asked about her thoughts on the establishment of Black Lives Matter she replied:\nAt the closing of the interview, Janie Torres, who was only a when her brother's life was taken, announced plans for an annual solidarity walk in memory of her brother. The walk is targeted across all generations with the focus on awareness of police racism across the nation. The second annual walk and rally occurred on May 6, 2017 in Houston, Texas. Janie plans on continuing to hold the walks annually, to be held on the yearly anniversaries of her brother's murder. For social awareness she has posted the walk on a Facebook homepage; \"Joe Campos Torres Solidarity Walk For Past & Future Generations\".\n\nThe documentary \"The Case of Joe Campos Torres\" recounts the calendar of events and ensuing community-protest assemblies, community/police department discussions, along with the legal actions taken by the Torres family against the Houston Police Department and the City of Houston.\n\nFilmed around Houston, the documentary records the Latino communities reaction to what they witnessed as an act of racial injustice against their population. The documentary, approximately 30 – 40 minutes in length, replays raw footage taken from local news station's archives. The footage is used as a reminder to viewers that before video cameras were able to bring police misconduct to light, the family of Torres had to rely on community support to help them find justice.\n\nThe film was produced in 1977 by Tony Bruni and Houston's KPRC-TV, Channel 2. Carlos Calbillo both wrote and edited the film and it was reported by John Quiñones, who is now with ABC News and hosts the series \"What Would You Do?\".\n\n"}

There are reports of an elephant brought to the United States in 1796, but it is not known for certain that this was the elephant that was later named Old Bet.\n\nThe first elephant brought to the United States was in 1796, aboard the \"America\" which set sail from Calcutta for New York on December 3, 1795. \nHowever, it is not certain that this was Old Bet. The first references to Old Bet start in 1804 in Boston as part of a menagerie. In 1808, while residing in Somers, New York, Hachaliah Bailey purchased the menagerie elephant for $1,000 and named it \"Old Bet\".\n\nOn July 24, 1816, Old Bet was killed while on tour near Alfred, Maine by local farmer Daniel Davis who shot her, and was later convicted of the crime. While many people believe that the farmer thought it was sinful for people to pay to see an animal, another suspected reason is jealousy.\n\nIn 1821, the Barnum's American Museum in New York announced that they had bought the hide and bones of Old Bet and would mount the remains at the museum. The elephant was memorialized in 1825 with a statue and the Elephant Hotel in Somers, New York. In 1922 the elephant John L.

{"id": "1573719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1573719", "title": "Onryō", "text": "Onryō\n\nIn traditional beliefs of Japan and in literature, onryō (怨霊, literally \"vengeful spirit\", sometimes rendered \"wrathful spirit\") refers to a ghost (\"yūrei\") believed capable of causing harm in the world of the living, harming or killing enemies, or even causing natural disasters to exact vengeance to redress the wrongs it received while alive then takes their spirits from their dying bodies.\n\nThe term overlaps somewhat with , except that in the cult of the \"goryō\", the acting agent need not necessarily be a wrathful spirit.\n\nWhile the origin of \"onryō\" is unclear, belief in their existence can be traced back to the 8th century and was based on the idea that powerful and enraged souls of the dead could influence or harm the living people. The earliest \"onryō\" cult that developed was around Prince Nagaya who died in 729; and the first record of possession by the \"onryō\" spirit affecting the health is found in the chronicle \"Shoku Nihongi\" (797), which states that \"'s soul harmed Genbō to death\" (Hirotsugu having died in a failed insurrection, named the \"Fujiwara no Hirotsugu Rebellion\", after failing to remove his rival, the priest Genbō, from power).\n\nTraditionally in Japan, \"onryō\" driven by vengeance were thought capable of causing not only their enemy's death, as in the case of Hirotsugu's vengeful spirit held responsible for killing the priest Genbō,), but causing natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires, storms, drought, famine and pestilence, as in the case of Prince Sawara's spirit embittered against his brother, the Emperor Kanmu. In common parlance, such vengeance exacted by supernatural beings or forces is termed .\n\nThe Emperor Kanmu had accused his brother Sawara of plotting (possibly falsely to remove him as rival to the throne), and the latter who was exiled died by fasting. The reason that the Emperor moved the capital to Nagaoka-kyō thence to Kyoto was an attempt to avoid the wrath of his brother's spirit, according to a number of scholars. This not succeeding entirely, the emperor tried to lift the curse by appeasing his brother's ghost, by performing Buddhist rites to pay respect, and granting Prince Sawara the posthumous title of emperor.\n\nA well-known example of appeasement of the \"onryō\" spirit is the case of Sugawara no Michizane, who had been politically disgraced and died in exile. Believed to cause the death of his calumniators in quick succession, as well as catastrophes (especially lightning damage), and the court tried to appease the wrathful spirit by restoring Michizane's old rank and position. Michizane became deified in the cult of the Tenjin, with Tenman-gū shrines erected around him.\n\nPossibly the most famous \"onryō\" is Oiwa, from the \"Yotsuya Kaidan\". In this story the husband remains unharmed; however, he is the target of the \"onryō\"’s vengeance. Oiwa's vengeance on him isn't physical retribution, but rather psychological torment.\n\nOther examples include:\n\n\n\nHisako (久子, \"Eternal Child\" or \"Everlasting Child\") from the third entry of the fighting game Killer Instinct, is an onryō who died while defending her village. She still haunts her old village and will take vengeance on anyone who desecrates it's ruins with her naginata. She has pale white skin, long black hair like most Onryo. \n\nIn Fall 2018 the asymetrical horror game, Dead By Daylight released The Spirit DLC. The Spirit is an onryō who returns from the dead after being brutally murdered by her Father.\n\nTraditionally, \"onryō\" and other \"yūrei\" (ghosts) had no particular appearance. However, with the rising of popularity of Kabuki during the Edo period, a specific costume was developed.\n\nHighly visual in nature, and with a single actor often assuming various roles within a play, Kabuki developed a system of visual shorthand that allowed the audience to instantly clue in as to which character is on stage, as well as emphasize the emotions and expressions of the actor.\n\nA ghost costume consisted of three main elements:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "417111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=417111", "title": "Pain management", "text": "Pain management\n\nPain management, pain medicine, pain control or algiatry, is a branch of medicine employing an interdisciplinary approach for easing the suffering and improving the quality of life of those living with chronic pain The typical pain management team includes medical practitioners, pharmacists, clinical psychologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, physician assistants, nurses. The team may also include other mental health specialists and massage therapists. Pain sometimes resolves promptly once the underlying trauma or pathology has healed, and is treated by one practitioner, with drugs such as analgesics and (occasionally) anxiolytics. Effective management of chronic (long-term) pain, however, frequently requires the coordinated efforts of the management team.\n\nMedicine treats injury and pathology to support and speed healing; and treats distressing symptoms such as pain to relieve suffering during treatment and healing. When a painful injury or pathology is resistant to treatment and persists, when pain persists after the injury or pathology has healed, and when medical science cannot identify the cause of pain, the task of medicine is to relieve suffering. Treatment approaches to chronic pain include pharmacological measures, such as analgesics, antidepressants and anticonvulsants, interventional procedures, physical therapy, physical exercise, application of ice and/or heat, and psychological measures, such as biofeedback and cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nPain can have many causes and there are many possible treatments for it. In the nursing profession, one common definition of pain is any problem that is \"whatever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever the experiencing person says it does\". Different sorts of pain management address different sorts of pain.\n\nPain management includes patient communication about the pain problem. To define the pain problem, a health care provider will likely ask questions such as these:\nAfter asking questions such as these, the health care provider will have a description of the pain. Pain management will then be used to address that pain.\n\nThere are many types of pain management, and each of them have their own benefits, drawbacks, and limits.\n\nA common difficulty in pain management is communication. People experiencing pain may have difficulty recognizing or describing what they feel and how intense it is. Health care providers and patients may have difficulty communicating with each other about how pain responds to treatments. There is a continuing risk in many types of pain management for the patient to take treatment which is less effective than needed or which causes other difficulty and side effects. Some treatments for pain can be harmful if overused. A goal of pain management for the patient and their health care provider to identify the amount of treatment which addresses the pain but which is not too much treatment.\n\nAnother problem with pain management is that pain is the body's natural way of communicating a problem. Pain is supposed to resolve as the body heals itself with time and pain management. Sometimes pain management covers a problem, and the patient might be less aware that they need treatment for a deeper problem.\n\nPhysical medicine and rehabilitation employs diverse physical techniques such as thermal agents and electrotherapy, as well as therapeutic exercise and behavioral therapy, alone or in tandem with interventional techniques and conventional pharmacotherapy to treat pain, usually as part of an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary program.\n\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation has been found to be ineffective for lower back pain, however, it might help with diabetic neuropathy.\n\nAcupuncture involves the insertion and manipulation of needles into specific points on the body to relieve pain or for therapeutic purposes. An analysis of the 13 highest quality studies of pain treatment with acupuncture, published in January 2009 in the \"British Medical Journal\", was unable to quantify the difference in the effect on pain of real, sham and no acupuncture.\n\nResearch has not found evidence that light therapy such as low level laser therapy is an effective therapy for relieving low back pain.\n\nInterventional procedures - typically used for chronic back pain - include epidural steroid injections, facet joint injections, neurolytic blocks, spinal cord stimulators and intrathecal drug delivery system implants.\n\nPulsed radiofrequency, neuromodulation, direct introduction of medication and nerve ablation may be used to target either the tissue structures and organ/systems responsible for persistent nociception or the nociceptors from the structures implicated as the source of chronic pain.\n\nAn intrathecal pump used to deliver very small quantities of medications directly to the spinal fluid. This is similar to epidural infusions used in labour and postoperatively. The major differences are that it is much more common for the drug to be delivered into the spinal fluid (intrathecal) rather than epidurally, and the pump can be fully implanted under the skin. \n\nA spinal cord stimulator is an implantable medical device that creates electric impulses and applies them near the dorsal surface of the spinal cord provides a paresthesia (\"tingling\") sensation that alters the perception of pain by the patient.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain helps patients with pain to understand the relationship between one's physiology (e.g., pain and muscle tension), thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. A main goal in treatment is cognitive restructuring to encourage helpful thought patterns, targeting a behavioral activation of healthy activities such as regular exercise and pacing. Lifestyle changes are also trained to improve sleep patterns and to develop better coping skills for pain and other stressors using various techniques (e.g., relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing, and even biofeedback).\n\nStudies have demonstrated the usefulness of cognitive behavioral therapy in the management of chronic low back pain, producing significant decreases in physical and psychosocial disability. A study published in the January 2012 issue of the \"Archives of Internal Medicine\" found CBT is significantly more effective than standard care in treatment of people with body-wide pain, like fibromyalgia. Evidence for the usefulness of CBT in the management of adult chronic pain is generally poorly understood, due partly to the proliferation of techniques of doubtful quality, and the poor quality of reporting in clinical trials. The crucial content of individual interventions has not been isolated and the important contextual elements, such as therapist training and development of treatment manuals, have not been determined. The widely varying nature of the resulting data makes useful systematic review and meta-analysis within the field very difficult.\n\nIn 2012, a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the clinical effectiveness of psychological therapies for the management of adult chronic pain (excluding headaches). There is no evidence that behaviour therapy (BT) is effective for reducing this type of pain, however BT may be useful for improving a persons mood immediately after treatment. This improvement appears to be small, and is short term in duration. CBT may have a small positive short-term effect on pain immediately following treatment. CBT may also have a small effect on reducing disability and potential catastrophizing that may be associated with adult chronic pain. These benefits do not appear to last very long following the therapy. CBT may contribute towards improving the mood of an adult who experiences chronic pain, and there is a possibility that this benefit may be maintained for longer periods of time.\n\nFor children and adolescents, a review of RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of psychological therapy for the management of chronic and recurrent pain found that psychological treatments are effective in reducing pain when people under 18 years old have headaches. This beneficial effect may be maintained for at least three months following the therapy. Psychological treatments may also improve pain control for children or adolescents who experience pain not related to headaches. It is not known if psychological therapy improves a child or adolescents mood and the potential for disability related to their chronic pain.\n\nA 2007 review of 13 studies found evidence for the efficacy of hypnosis in the reduction of pain in some conditions, though the number of patients enrolled in the studies was small, bringing up issues of power to detect group differences, and most lacked credible controls for placebo and/or expectation. The authors concluded that \"although the findings provide support for the general applicability of hypnosis in the treatment of chronic pain, considerably more research will be needed to fully determine the effects of hypnosis for different chronic-pain conditions.\"\n\nHypnosis has reduced the pain of some noxious medical procedures in children and adolescents, and in clinical trials addressing other patient groups it has significantly reduced pain compared to no treatment or some other non-hypnotic interventions. However, no studies have compared hypnosis to a convincing placebo, so the pain reduction may be due to patient expectation (the \"placebo effect\"). The effects of self hypnosis on chronic pain are roughly comparable to those of progressive muscle relaxation.\n\nA meta-analysis of studies that used techniques centered around the concept of mindfulness, concluded, \"Findings suggest that MBIs decrease the intensity of pain for chronic pain patients.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a \"pain ladder\" for managing analgesia. It was first described for use in cancer pain, but it can be used by medical professionals as a general principle when dealing with analgesia for any type of pain. In the treatment of chronic pain, whether due to malignant or benign processes, the three-step WHO Analgesic Ladder provides guidelines for selecting the kind and stepping up the amount of analgesia. The exact medications recommended will vary with the country and the individual treatment center, but the following gives an example of the WHO approach to treating chronic pain with medications. If, at any point, treatment fails to provide adequate pain relief, then the doctor and patient move onto the next step.\n\nParacetamol (acetaminophen), or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen.\n\nParacetamol, an NSAID and/or paracetamol in a combination product with a weak opioid such as tramadol, may provide greater relief than their separate use. Also a combination of opioid with acetaminophen can be frequently used such as Percocet, Vicodin, or Norco.\n\nWhen treating moderate to severe pain, the type of the pain, acute or chronic, needs to be considered. The type of pain can result in different medications being prescribed. Certain medications may work better for acute pain, others for chronic pain, and some may work equally well on both. Acute pain medication is for rapid onset of pain such as from an inflicted trauma or to treat post-operative pain. Chronic pain medication is for alleviating long-lasting, ongoing pain.\n\nMorphine is the gold standard to which all narcotics are compared. Semi-synthetic derivatives of morphine such as hydromorphone (Dilaudid), oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), nicomorphine (Vilan), hydromorphinol and others vary in such ways as duration of action, side effect profile and milligramme potency. Fentanyl has the benefit of less histamine release and thus fewer side effects. It can also be administered via transdermal patch which is convenient for chronic pain management. In addition to the intrathecal patch and injectable Sublimaze, the FDA has approved various immediate release fentanyl products for breakthrough cancer pain (Actiq/OTFC/Fentora/Onsolis/Subsys/Lazanda/Abstral). Oxycodone is used across the Americas and Europe for relief of serious chronic pain; its main slow-release formula is known as OxyContin, and short-acting tablets, capsules, syrups and ampules are available making it suitable for acute intractable pain or breakthrough pain. Diamorphine, methadone and buprenorphine are used less frequently. Pethidine, known in North America as meperidine, is not recommended for pain management due to its low potency, short duration of action, and toxicity associated with repeated use. Pentazocine, dextromoramide and dipipanone are also not recommended in new patients except for acute pain where other analgesics are not tolerated or are inappropriate, for pharmacological and misuse-related reasons. In some countries potent synthetics such as piritramide and ketobemidone are used for severe pain, and tapentadol is a newer agent introduced in the last decade.\n\nFor moderate pain, tramadol, codeine, dihydrocodeine, and hydrocodone are used, with nicocodeine, ethylmorphine and propoxyphene and dextropropoxyphene less commonly.\n\nDrugs of other types can be used to help opioids combat certain types of pain, for example, amitriptyline is prescribed for chronic muscular pain in the arms, legs, neck and lower back with an opiate, or sometimes without it and/or with an NSAID.\n\nWhile opiates are often used in the management of chronic pain, high doses are associated with an increased risk of opioid overdose.\n\nFrom the Food and Drug Administration's website: \"According to the National Institutes of Health, studies have shown that properly managed medical use of opioid analgesic compounds (taken exactly as prescribed) is safe, can manage pain effectively, and rarely causes addiction.\"\n\nOpioid medications can provide short, intermediate or long acting analgesia depending upon the specific properties of the medication and whether it is formulated as an extended release drug. Opioid medications may be administered orally, by injection, via nasal mucosa or oral mucosa, rectally, transdermally, intravenously, epidurally and intrathecally. In chronic pain conditions that are opioid responsive a combination of a long-acting (OxyContin, MS Contin, Opana ER, Exalgo and Methadone) or extended release medication is often prescribed in conjunction with a shorter-acting medication (oxycodone, morphine or hydromorphone) for breakthrough pain, or exacerbations.\n\nMost opioid treatment used by patients outside of healthcare settings is oral (tablet, capsule or liquid), but suppositories and skin patches can be prescribed. An opioid injection is rarely needed for patients with chronic pain.\n\nAlthough opioids are strong analgesics, they do not provide complete analgesia regardless of whether the pain is acute or chronic in origin. Opioids are efficacious analgesics in chronic malignant pain and modestly effective in nonmalignant pain management. However, there are associated adverse effects, especially during the commencement or change in dose. When opioids are used for prolonged periods drug tolerance, chemical dependency, diversion and addiction may occur.\n\nClinical guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain have been issued by the American Pain Society and the American Academy of Pain Medicine. Included in these guidelines is the importance of assessing the patient for the risk of substance abuse, misuse, or addiction; a personal or family history of substance abuse is the strongest predictor of aberrant drug-taking behavior. Physicians who prescribe opioids should integrate this treatment with any psychotherapeutic intervention the patient may be receiving. The guidelines also recommend monitoring not only the pain but also the level of functioning and the achievement of therapeutic goals. The prescribing physician should be suspicious of abuse when a patient reports a reduction in pain but has no accompanying improvement in function or progress in achieving identified goals.\n\nCommonly-used long-acting opioids and their parent compound:\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Methadone can be used for either treatment of opioid addiction/detoxification when taken once daily or as a pain medication usually administered on an every 12-hour or 8-hour dosing interval.\n\nThe other major group of analgesics are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Acetaminophen/paracetamol is not always included in this class of medications. However, acetaminophen may be administered as a single medication or in combination with other analgesics (both NSAIDs and opioids). The alternatively prescribed NSAIDs such as ketoprofen and piroxicam have limited benefit in chronic pain disorders and with long-term use are associated with significant adverse effects. The use of selective NSAIDs designated as selective COX-2 inhibitors have significant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risks which have limited their utilization.\n\nSome antidepressant and antiepileptic drugs are used in chronic pain management and act primarily within the pain pathways of the central nervous system, though peripheral mechanisms have been attributed as well. These mechanisms vary and in general are more effective in neuropathic pain disorders as well as complex regional pain syndrome.\n\nChronic pain is one of the most commonly cited reasons for the use of medical marijuana. A 2012 Canadian survey of participants in their medical marijuana program found that 84% of respondents reported using medical marijuana for the management of pain.\n\nEvidence of medical marijuana's pain mitigating effects is generally conclusive. Detailed in a 1999 report by the Institute of Medicine, \"the available evidence from animal and human studies indicates that cannabinoids can have a substantial analgesic effect\". In a 2013 review study published in \"Fundamental & Clinical Pharmacology\", various studies were cited in demonstrating that cannabinoids exhibit comparable effectiveness to opioids in models of acute pain and even greater effectiveness in models of chronic pain.\n\nOther drugs are often used to help analgesics combat various types of pain, and parts of the overall pain experience, and are hence called analgesic adjuvant medications. Gabapentin—an anti-epileptic—not only exerts effects alone on neuropathic pain, but can potentiate opiates. While perhaps not prescribed as such, other drugs such as Tagamet (cimetidine) and even simple grapefruit juice may also potentiate opiates, by inhibiting CYP450 enzymes in the liver, thereby slowing metabolism of the drug. In addition, orphenadrine, cyclobenzaprine, trazodone and other drugs with anticholinergic properties are useful in conjunction with opioids for neuropathic pain. Orphenadrine and cyclobenzaprine are also muscle relaxants, and therefore particularly useful in painful musculoskeletal conditions. Clonidine has found use as an analgesic for this same purpose, and all of the mentioned drugs potentiate the effects of opioids overall.\n\nThe medical treatment of pain as practiced in Greece and Turkey is called algology (from the Greek άλγος, algos, \"pain\"). The Hellenic Society of Algology and the Turkish Algology-Pain Society are the relevant local bodies affiliated to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP).\n\nUndertreatment of pain is the absence of pain management therapy for a person in pain when treatment is indicated.\n\nConsensus in evidence-based medicine and the recommendations of medical specialty organizations establish the guidelines which determine the treatment for pain which health care providers ought to offer. For various social reasons, persons in pain may not seek or may not be able to access treatment for their pain. At the same time, health care providers may not provide the treatment which authorities recommend.\n\nAcute pain is common in children and adolescents as a result of injury, illness, or necessary medical procedures. Chronic pain is present in approximately 15–25% of children and adolescents, and may be caused by an underlying disease, such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or cancer or by functional disorders such as migraines, fibromyalgia, or complex regional pain.\n\n\nPain assessment in children is often challenging due to limitations in developmental level, cognitive ability, or their previous pain experiences. Clinicians must observe physiological and behavioral cues exhibited by the child to make an assessment. Self-report, if possible, is the most accurate measure of pain; self-report pain scales developed for young children involve matching their pain intensity to photographs of other children's faces, such as the Oucher Scale, pointing to schematics of faces showing different pain levels, or pointing out the location of pain on a body outline. Questionnaires for older children and adolescents include the Varni-Thompson Pediatric Pain Questionnaire (PPQ) and the Children’s Comprehensive Pain Questionnaire, which are often utilized for individuals with chronic or persistent pain.\n\n\nCaregivers may provide nonpharmacological treatment for children and adolescents because it carries minimal risk and is cost effective compared to pharmacological treatment. Nonpharmacologic interventions vary by age and developmental factors. Physical interventions to ease pain in infants include swaddling, rocking, or sucrose via a pacifier, whereas those for children and adolescents include hot or cold application, massage, or acupuncture. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) aims to reduce the emotional distress and improve the daily functioning of school-aged children and adolescents with pain through focus on changing the relationship between their thoughts and emotions in addition to teaching them adaptive coping strategies. Integrated interventions in CBT include relaxation technique, mindfulness, biofeedback, and acceptance (in the case of chronic pain). Many therapists will hold sessions for caregivers to provide them with effective management strategies.\n\n\nAcetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and opioid analgesics are commonly used to treat acute or chronic pain symptoms in children and adolescents, but a pediatrician should be consulted before administering any medication.\n\nPain management practitioners come from all fields of medicine. In addition to medical practitioners, a pain management team may often benefit from the input of pharmacists, physiotherapists, clinical psychologists and occupational therapists, among others. Together the multidisciplinary team can help create a package of care suitable to the patient.\n\nPain physicians are often fellowship-trained board-certified anesthesiologists, neurologists, physiatrists or psychiatrists. Palliative care doctors are also specialists in pain management. The American Board of Anesthesiology, the American Osteopathic Board of Anesthesiology (recognized by the AOABOS), the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology each provide certification for a subspecialty in pain management following fellowship training which is recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) or the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (AOABOS). As the field of pain medicine has grown rapidly, many practitioners have entered the field, some non-ACGME board-certified.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "400776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=400776", "title": "Propaganda of the deed", "text": "Propaganda of the deed\n\nPropaganda of the deed (or propaganda by the deed, from the French \"propagande par le fait\") is specific political action meant to be exemplary to others and serve as a catalyst for revolution.\n\nIt is primarily associated with acts of violence perpetrated by proponents of insurrectionary anarchism in the late 19th and early 20th century, including bombings and assassinations aimed at the ruling class, but also had non-violent applications. These \"deeds\" were to ignite the \"spirit of revolt\" in the people by demonstrating the state was not omnipotent and by offering hope to the downtrodden, and also to expand support for anarchist movements as the state grew more repressive in its response. In 1881, the International Anarchist Congress of London gave the tactic its approval.\n\nOne of the first individuals to conceptualise propaganda by the deed was the Italian revolutionary Carlo Pisacane (1818–57), who wrote in his \"Political Testament\" (1857) that \"ideas spring from deeds and not the other way around.\" Mikhail Bakunin (1814–1876), in his \"Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis\" (1870) stated that \"we must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda.\" The concept, in a broader setting, has a rich heritage, as the words of Francis of Assisi reveal: \"Let them show their love by the works they do for each other, according as the Apostle says: 'let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.\n\nSome anarchists, such as Johann Most, advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because \"we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.\" It was not advocacy for mass murder, but a call for targeted killings of the representatives of capitalism and government at a time when such action might garner sympathy from the population, such as during periods of government repression or labor conflicts, although Most himself once boasted that \"the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.\" In 1885, he published \"The Science of Revolutionary Warfare\", a technical manual for acquiring and detonating explosives based on the knowledge he acquired by working at an explosives factory in New Jersey. Most was an early influence on American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Berkman attempted propaganda by the deed when he tried in 1892 to kill industrialist Henry Clay Frick following the deaths by shooting of several striking workers.\n\nBeverly Gage, professor of U.S. history at Yale University, elaborates on what the concept meant to outsiders and those within the anarchist movement:\n\nBy the 1880s, the slogan \"propaganda of the deed\" had begun to be used both within and outside of the anarchist movement to refer to individual bombings, regicides and tyrannicides. In 1881, \"propaganda by the deed\" was formally adopted as a strategy by the anarchist London Congress. In 1886, French anarchist Clément Duval achieved a form of propaganda of the deed, stealing 15,000 francs from the mansion of a Parisian socialite, before accidentally setting the house on fire. Caught two weeks later, he was dragged from the court crying \"Long live anarchy!\", and condemned to death. Duval's sentence was later commuted to hard labor on Devil's Island, French Guiana. In the anarchist paper \"Révolte\", Duval famously declared that, \"Theft exists only through the exploitation of man by man... when Society refuses you the right to exist, you must take it... the policeman arrested me in the name of the Law, I struck him in the name of Liberty\".\n\nAs early as 1887, a few important figures in the anarchist movement had begun to distance themselves from individual acts of violence. Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in \"Le Révolté\" that \"a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite\". A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement. The anarcho-syndicalist, Fernand Pelloutier, argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without \"the individual dynamiter.\"\n\nState repression (including the infamous 1894 French \"lois scélérates\") of the anarchist and labor movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many \"communards\" to penal colonies, favored individualist political expression and acts.\n\nAnarchist historian Max Nettlau provided a more complex concept of propaganda when he said that,\n\nLater anarchist authors advocating \"propaganda of the deed\" included the German anarchist Gustav Landauer, and the Italians Errico Malatesta and Luigi Galleani. For Gustav Landauer, \"propaganda of the deed\" meant the creation of libertarian social forms and communities that would inspire others to transform society. In \"Weak Statesmen, Weaker People,\" he wrote that the state is not something \"that one can smash in order to destroy. The state is a relationship between human beings... one destroys it by entering into other relationships.\"\"\n\nIn contrast, Errico Malatesta described \"propaganda by the deed\" as violent communal insurrections that were meant to ignite the imminent revolution. However, Malatesta himself denounced the use of terrorism and violent physical force, stating in one of his essays:\n\nAt the other extreme, the anarchist Luigi Galleani, perhaps the most vocal proponent of \"propaganda by the deed\" from the turn of the century through the end of the First World War, took undisguised pride in describing himself as a subversive, a revolutionary propagandist and advocate of the violent overthrow of established government and institutions through the use of 'direct action', i.e., bombings and assassinations. Galleani heartily embraced physical violence and terrorism, not only against symbols of the government and the capitalist system, such as courthouses and factories, but also through direct assassination of 'enemies of the people': capitalists, industrialists, politicians, judges, and policemen. He had a particular interest in the use of bombs, going so far as to include a formula for the explosive nitroglycerine in one of his pamphlets advertised through his monthly magazine, \"Cronaca Sovversiva\". By all accounts, Galleani was an extremely effective speaker and advocate of his policy of violent action, attracting a number of devoted Italian-American anarchist followers who called themselves Galleanists. Carlo Buda, the brother of Galleanist bombmaker Mario Buda, said of him, \"You heard Galleani speak, and you were ready to shoot the first policeman you saw\".\"\n\nPropaganda of the deed is also related to illegalism, an anarchist philosophy that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland during the early 20th century as an outgrowth of anarchist individualism. The illegalists openly embraced criminality as a lifestyle. Influenced by theorist Max Stirner's concept of \"egoism\", the illegalists broke from anarchists like Clément Duval and Marius Jacob who justified theft with a theory of individual reclamation. Instead, the illegalists argued that their actions required no moral basis – illegal acts were taken not in the name of a higher ideal, but in pursuit of one's own desires. France's Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.\n\nPropaganda of the deed thus included stealing (in particular bank robberies – named \"expropriations\" or \"revolutionary expropriations\" to finance the organization), rioting and general strikes which aimed at creating the conditions of an insurrection or even a revolution. These acts were justified as the necessary counterpart to state repression. As early as 1911, Leon Trotsky condemned individual acts of violence by anarchists as useful for little more than providing an excuse for state repression. \"The anarchist prophets of the 'propaganda by the deed' can argue all they want about the elevating and stimulating influence of terrorist acts on the masses,\" he wrote in 1911, \"Theoretical considerations and political experience prove otherwise.\" Vladimir Lenin largely agreed, viewing individual anarchist acts of terrorism as an ineffective substitute for coordinated action by disciplined cadres of the masses. Both Lenin and Trotsky acknowledged the necessity of violent rebellion and assassination to serve as a catalyst for revolution, but they distinguished between the \"ad hoc\" bombings and assassinations carried out by proponents of the propaganda of the deed, and organized violence coordinated by a professional revolutionary vanguard utilized for that specific end.\n\nSociologist Max Weber wrote that the state has a \"monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force\", or, in Karl Marx's words, the state was only the repressive apparatus of the bourgeois class. Propaganda by the deed, including assassinations (sometimes involving bombs, named in French \"machines infernales\" – \"hellish machines\", usually made with bombs, sometimes only several guns assembled together), were thus legitimized by part of the anarchist movement and the First International as a valid means to be used in class struggle. The predictable state responses to these actions were supposed to display to the people the inherently repressive nature of the bourgeois state, delegitimizing it (legitimacy being key). This would in turn bolster the revolutionary spirit of the people, leading to the overthrow of the state. This is the basic formula of the cycle protests-repression-protests, which in specific conditions may lead to an effective state of insurrection.\n\nThis cycle has been observed during the 1905 Russian Revolution or in Paris in May 1968. However, it failed to achieve its revolutionary objective on the vast majority of occasions, thus leading to the abandonment by the vast majority of the anarchist movement of such bombings. However, the state never failed in its repressive response, enforcing various \"lois scélérates\" which usually involved tough clampdowns on the whole of the labor movement. These harsh laws, sometimes accompanied by the proclamation of the state of exception, progressively led to increased criticism among the anarchist movement of assassinations. The role of several \"agents provocateurs\" and the use of deliberate strategies of tension by governments, using such false flag terrorist actions as the Spanish La Mano Negra, work to discredit this violent tactic in the eyes of most socialist libertarians. John Filiss and Jim Bell are two of the best known modern advocates, with the latter developing the concept of an assassination marketa market system for anonymously hiring and compensating political assassination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter defined the term \"terrorism\" as consisting of \"Criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.\"\n\nThe use of political violence is understood by its proponents in the frame of a general conception of the state as the control apparatus of the bourgeoisie, and of class struggle as a form of effective civil war. Thus, as anarchists often put it, \"peace without justice isn't peace\", but war between exploited and exploiters. In their eyes, this \"social war\" morally legitimizes the use of violence against broader \"social violence.\" This view, of course, is not shared by pacifist libertarians. Rioting is thus justified as a means to enhance class consciousness and prepares the objective conditions for a popular uprising (Georges Sorel, 1906).\n\nEven those who are not opposed to the political use of violence for theoretical reasons (as pacifist anarchists are) may consider it unnecessary or strategically dangerous, in certain conditions. Many note that the events of 1970s showed clearly how terrorism may be used to influence politics in the frame of the \"strategy of tension\" by a state and its secret services, through agents provocateurs and false flag terrorist attacks. In Italy and other countries, the Years of lead led to reinforced anti-terrorism legislation, criticized by social activists as a new form of \"lois scélérates\" which were used to repress the whole of the socialist movement, not just militant groups. Many also note that the rare cases in which terrorism has achieved its revolutionary aims are mostly in the context of national liberation struggles, while the urban guerrilla movements have all failed (Gérard Chaliand).\n\nArmed propaganda is a type of propaganda used by revolutionary organizations that uses destructive, but ideally not lethal violence to make a political point known to the public and eventually gain supporters for its cause. The term was used in the United States by the Weather Underground and the Black Panther Party to describe some of their bombings. Although armed propaganda can use guns or bombs, its proponents argue that its goal is debatably different from that of pure terrorism.\n\nDan Berger, in his book about the Weatherman organization, \"Outlaws in America\", describes the planning section for a townhouse bombing by the group, describing the action as \"armed propaganda\".\n\nThe term has been applied to guerillas in Latin America in their revolutionary literature.\n\nBizhan Jazani used a translation of the term to describe armed struggle in Iran, particularly the Fadai guerrillas.\n\n\n\n"}

The Psions first appeared in \"Tales of the New Teen Titans\" (vol. 1) #4 (September 1982) and were created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez. The earliest uncredited appearance of the Psions was in \"The Witching Hour\" #13 (March 1971) written by Marv Wolfman.\n\nBillions of years ago, on the planet Maltus, the Maltusian immortals studied all aspects of life. They took a local reptile for testing and discovered one part of the lizard's mind had the potential for much greater complexity. They enhanced the creatures and found the new developments were passed to each succeeding generation. The reptiles were released back into the wild to chart their survival rate.\n\nThe Maltusians eventually left their world in a great exodus. The enhanced reptiles evolved into the Psion race. The early Psions investigated the Maltusian labs and mimicked their creators. They went as far as cutting off their tails to look more like the Maltusians (and, as a result, disavowing their original background). After several millennia, the Psions left Maltus to follow their creators, now known as the Guardians of the Universe, who were on Oa.\n\nWhen the two discovered each other, things were not quite what the Psions expected. The Oans regretted their decision not to destroy their equipment before leaving Maltus. The Psions wished to learn more from the Guardians, but were forbidden to travel to Oa. Though the Psions had mastered the technology, they had gained little understanding. The Guardians felt responsible for the Psions and sent them to a distant galaxy where they could strive for comprehension. The Guardians ordered the Psions to stay within their assigned area so they would not be disturbed. The Guardians hoped the Psions would achieve their own greatness. The Green Lantern Corps would not be allowed to interfere with the Psions as part of the process. The Guardians' great hope has not come to fruition.\n\nDiscovering their creators and then feeling humiliated by the same, the Psions buried the truth. As a species they forgot their background and began anew their scientific work. As scientists, the Psions asked the questions all thinkers ask, such as \"Where are we from?\" Again and again, the Psions discovered the truth about their origins, and every time they suppressed the knowledge. The Psions refuse to acknowledge that their creators did not want them or believe in them. When hearing the truth, in pain, they go into shock and incapacitate themselves. This process also suppresses their knowledge of their genesis.\n\nThe Psions were among the many alien races that took part in invading Earth after the Dominators became worried about humanity's ability to produce super-powered individuals. Part of their contribution to the war effort included creating sedatives for prisoners in the Gulag that the Alliance maintained in deep space. A science team also worked out of Alliance Headquarters in conquered Australia. This team was killed when an effort to send a bomb through a JLI transporter backfired.\n\nA Psion was part of the Paradocs crew during the \"Our Worlds at War\" crossover. While helping tend to a gravely injured Wonder Woman, he openly stated she was most likely beyond saving and that he should start dissecting her. Fortunately, Hippolyta took over treatment for her daughter.\n\nThe Psions maintain vast floating laboratories where studies continue. There they exploit the life forms they found in the Vegan star system. Working with their science, they created the many species of Vega's twenty-five worlds, subconsciously replicating their own origins. Active against them are the Omega Men, an interstellar group of rebels drawn from the Vegan worlds. Psion experiments accidentally created the Vegan goddess X'Hal. The Green Lantern Corps has been barred from entering or interfering within the Vegan star system due to an ancient pact with the Spider Guild. However, it is revealed in the fourth law of the rewritten book of Oa by the Guardians of the Universe that the Vega System is no longer outside of Green Lantern Corps' jurisdiction.[10] \n\nGreen Lanterns Kyle Rayner and Guy Gardner planned to breach Vegan space in order to retrieve recruit Soranik Natu. The mission was successful, thanks to the skills shown by Soranik, leading to the defeat of the Spider Guild.\n\n"}

The infection is transmitted from the reservoir population and may or may not be transmitted within the host population.\n\nSpillover is a common event; in fact, more than two thirds of human viruses are zoonotic . Most spillover events result in self-limited cases with no further human to human transmission, as occurs, for example, with rabies, antrax, histoplasmosis or hidatidosis. Other zoonotic pathogens are able to be transmitted by humans to produce secondary cases and even to establish limited chains of transmission. Some examples are the Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, the MERS and SARS coronaviruses or some avian flu viruses. Finally some few spillover events can result in the final adaptation of the microbe to the humans, who became a new stable reservoir, as occurred with the HIV virus resulting in the AIDS pandemic. In fact, most of the pathogens which are presently exclusive of humans were probably transmitted by animals sometime in the past . If the history of mutual adaptation is long enough, permanent host-microbe associations can be established resulting in co-evolution, and even on permanent integration of the microbe genome in the human genome, as it is the case of endogenous viruses. The closer the two species are in phylogenetic terms, the easier it is for microbes to overcome the biological barrier to produce successful spillovers. For this reason, other mammals are the main source of zoonotic agents for humans.\n\nCommercially bred bumblebees used to pollinate greenhouses can be reservoirs for several pollinator parasites including the protozoans \"Crithidia bombi\", and \"Apicystis bombi\", the Microsporidians \"Nosema bombi\" and \"Nosema ceranae\", plus viruses such as Deformed wing virus and the tracheal mites \"Locustacarus buchneri\". Commercial bees that escape the glasshouse environment may then infect wild bee populations. Infection may be via direct interactions between managed and wild bees or via shared flower use and contamination. One study found that half of all wild bees found near greenhouses were infected with \"C. bombi\". Rates and incidence of infection decline dramatically the further away from the greenhouses the wild bees are located. Instances of spillover between bumblebees are well documented across the world but particularly in Japan, North America and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "578057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=578057", "title": "Tollmann's hypothetical bolide", "text": "Tollmann's hypothetical bolide\n\nAlexander Tollmann's bolide, proposed by Edith Kristan-Tollmann and Alexander Tollmann in 1994, is a hypothesis presented by Austrian geologist Alexander Tollmann and paleontologist Edith Kristan-Tollmann, suggesting that one or several bolides (asteroids or comets) struck the Earth at 7640 BCE (±200), with a much smaller one at 3150 BCE (±200). If true, this hypothesis explains early Holocene extinctions and possibly legends of the Universal Deluge.\n\nThe claimed evidence for the event includes stratigraphic studies of tektites, dendrochronology, and ice cores (from Camp Century, Greenland) containing hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid (indicating an energetic ocean strike) as well as nitric acids (caused by extreme heating of air).\n\nChristopher Knight and Robert Lomas in their book, \"Uriel's Machine\", argue that the 7640 BCE evidence is consistent with the dates of formation of a number of extant salt flats and lakes in dry areas of North America and Asia. They argue that these lakes are the result remains of multiple-kilometer-high waves that penetrated deeply into continents as the result of oceanic strikes that they proposed occurred.\n\nQuaternary geologists, paleoclimatologists, and planetary geologists specializing in meteorite and comet impacts have rejected the Tollmann bolide hypothesis. They reject this hypothesis because:\n\n\nMuch of the evidence used by the Tollmann bolide hypothesis to argue for catastrophic Holocene impacts can be just as well, in most cases even better, explained by more pedestrian geological processes. For example, the chemical composition of and the presence of volcanic ash with the specific acidity spikes in the Greenland ice cores presents clear evidence that they are volcanic, not impact, in origin. Also, the largest acidity spikes found in Antarctica ice cores are far too old, from 17,300 to 17,500 BP, to be associated with any Holocene impacts. The formation of modern salt lakes and salt flats is readily explained by the concentration of salts and other evaporite minerals by the evaporation of water from stream-fed lakes lacking external outlets, called \"endorheic lakes\", in arid climates. The composition of the salts and other evaporate minerals found in these lakes is consistent with their precipitation from dissolved material continually carried into the lakes by rivers and streams and subsequent concentration by evaporation instead of evaporation of sea water. Whether a lake becomes salty or not simply depends on whether the lake lacks an outlet and the relative balance between water flowing into the lake and leaving the lake via evaporation. Ocean water dumped into a lake as the result of a single catastrophic event, as suggested above, would contain an inadequate amount of dissolved minerals to produce, when evaporated, the vast quantities of salts and other evaporites found in the salt lakes, flats, and pans cited as evidence of a mega-tsunami by this hypothesis.\n\nMany published papers clearly demonstrate that isostatic depression of the Earth's crust is not only real, but quite capable of submerging substantial portions of coastal areas adjacent to continental ice sheets and resulting in the accumulations of marine sediments and fossils within them. A well-documented example of flooding caused by isostatic depression is the case of Charlotte, The Vermont Whale, a fossil whale found in the deposits of the former Champlain Sea. Like many similar marine deposits, the sediments, which accumulated within the Champlain Sea lack the physical characteristics; i.e. sedimentary structures, interlayering, and textures, that characterize sediments deposited by a mega-tsunami. In addition, many of these deposits and the fossils, which they contain, are far too old, by hundreds to thousands of years, to have been created by impact around either 9,640 BP or 5,150 BP. In case of the Champlain Sea, its sediments started to accumulate around 13,000 BP, almost 3,400 years before the oldest of the hypothesized Holocene bolide impacts.\n\nAs noted above, a significant amount of the physical evidence used by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann to argue for this Holocene impact is either too old or too young to have been created by this hypothesized impact. In many cases, it is hundreds to thousands, and in one case hundreds of thousands, of years too old to be credible evidence of a Holocene impact. For example, the research that dates the tektites, which Tollmann bolide hypothesis regards as indicating the time of the hypothesized impact, is antiquated. Later research, has shown the tektites to be far too old, about 790,000 BP in case of the Australasian tektites, to have been associated with any of his hypothesized Holocene impacts. At this time, there exist no documented examples of Holocene tektites. In addition, the formation of salt lakes and salt flats is neither synchronous nor consistent with the hypothesized impacts having occurred about either 9,640 BP or 5,150 BP. For example, in case of Lake Bonneville, Lake Lahontan, Mono Lake, and other Pleistocene pluvial lakes in the western United States, the transition to salt lakes and salt flats occurred at different times between 12,000 and 16,000 BP. Thus, the change from freshwater to salty water and eventually salt flats started over 2,400 to 6,400 years before the oldest of the impacts hypothesized by the Tollmann bolide hypothesis occurred. As a result, it impossible that the formation of these salt lakes could have been associated with the impact hypothesized by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann.\n\nFinally, credible physical evidence of either multiple-kilometer-high tsunami waves penetrating deeply into continents and the ecological devastation they would have certainly caused have yet to be reported from any of the thousands of paleoenvironmental records constructed from the study of lakes, bogs, mires, and river valleys all over the world by palynologists. In the case of North America, various peer-reviewed publications summarize numerous published scientific papers that provide detailed records of paleoenvironmental changes that have occurred throughout the last 10,000 to 15,000 years as reconstructed from pollen and other paleoenvironmental data from over a thousand sites throughout North America. In none of these records, have palynologists recognized any indication of either the catastrophic environmental devastation or layers of tsunami deposits, which the mega-tsunamis postulated by the Tollmann bolide hypothesis would have created. Paleovegetation maps illustrate a distinct lack of the dramatic changes in North American paleovegetation during the Holocene, which would be expected from the cataclysmic ecological and physical destruction that a continental-wide mega-tsunamis would have certainly have caused.\n\nFor example, E. C. Grimm G. L. Jacobson and others documented a 50,000-year-long record of environmental change by the analysis of pollen from an core from Lake Tulane in Highland county, Florida. Because of the low-lying nature of the peninsula, in which this part of Florida lies, this lake and the area around it certainly would have been flooded and obliterated along with many of the other lakes and bogs described in their and other publications. The forests and associated ecosystems of these areas would have been flooded and completely obliterated by the mega-tsunamis proposed by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann. Despite its location, both the core and the pollen record recovered from Lake Tulane completely lacks any indication of any abrupt, catastrophic environmental disruptions, which the mega-tsunamis proposed by the Tollmann bolide hypothesis would have caused. This and other cores from Florida and elsewhere also lack sedimentary layers that have the characteristics of sediments deposited by either tsunamis or mega-tsunamis.\n\nThe cataclysmic scale of physical and ecological destruction that a megatsunami, like the one proposed by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann, would have caused to the Holocene landscape and ecosystems certainly would have left an obvious and readily recognizable signature within the majority of long-term environmental records. Such a signature has not been reported from the more than thousand cores from North America for which Holocene paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental records have been reconstructed. There is a similar lack of evidence for mega-tsunami related, Holocene, catastrophic environmental disruptions and deposits reported from environmental records reconstructed from thousands of locations from all over the world. This lack of a physical record for the occurrence of Holocene mega-tsunamis is quite revealing given that geologists and palynologists have been quite successful in some coastal regions finding in cores and exposures the characteristic sediments deposited by tsunamis locally generated by either earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or submarine slides and recovering abundant well-defined records of their environmental effects by studying the pollen from cores and exposures.\n\nMembers of the Holocene Impact Working Group have published papers advocating the occurrence of mega-tsunamis created by extraterrestrial impacts at various times during the Holocene and Late Pleistocene. However, none of these proposed impacts match either the cataclysmic scale or timing proposed by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann for Alexander Tollmann's bolide.\n\n\n"}

At the height of his career, his column on labor union issues was syndicated to 356 newspapers in the United States. In an incident which made national headlines for almost a year, a gangster threw sulfuric acid in his face on a public street in New York City on April 5, 1956, causing his permanent blindness.\n\nVictor Riesel was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City to Nathan and Sophie Riesel. The family lived in a cold water flat near the elevated railroad tracks. The Riesels were Jewish, and their neighbors were primarily Jewish and Italian American. Victor's father, Nathan, had helped organize the Bonnaz, Singer, and Hand Embroiderers' Union, Local 66, of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union in 1913, and held the Card No. 1 in the local union. In time, Nathan Riesel was appointed a staff member of the union and elected secretary-treasurer and then president of the local union. Victor attended elementary school at (now the Judith K. Weiss School).\n\nWhen Victor was three years old, his father taught him to make pro-union speeches and would take his son to rallies and union meetings and have the boy recite the speeches for onlookers. Attending union meetings, indoor and outdoor rallies, and standing on street corners promoting the union formed many of Victor Riesel's childhood and teenage memories. In the 1920s and 1930s, Nathan Riesel successfully opposed Communist Party USA attempts to infiltrate activists into the local union and turning its purpose to promotion of the party (a strategy known as \"boring from within\"). Throughout his childhood and teenage years, he saw his father come home bleeding many times after fistfights with communist activists or gangsters. This conflict left a deep impression on Victor.\n\nThe family moved to the Bronx when Riesel was 13 years old. Academically gifted, Victor Riesel graduated from Morris High School at the age of 15. While in high school, Riesel began typing stories about the American labor movement and sending them to English language newspapers around the world, charging $1 for publication rights. He typed the same story over and over (sometimes as many as 15 times) to make it look like an original (his goal being to sell the same story to many newspapers rather than many stories to a single newspaper), and earned a significant income from this work.\n\nHe enrolled in City College of New York (CCNY) in 1928, taking classes at night in human resource management and industrial relations. \n\nRiesel worked several different jobs to support himself, and found employment in a hat factory, lace plant, steel mill, and saw mill. He was appointed director of undergraduate publications at the college, working as an editor, columnist, and literature and theatre critic. He earned his Bachelor of Business Administration from CCNY in 1940.\n\nDuring his undergraduate years at CCNY, Riesel began working as a gofer at \"The New Leader\". After graduation in 1940, he became the magazine's managing editor.\n\nTwo additional events in Riesel's life led him to a career as a labor reporter. The first occurred on March 6, 1930, during a visit to his father's union offices. Riesel saw a man weeping on the stairs because he had no job and his family had no food to eat. The second occurred in 1942. Nathan Riesel was now fighting organized crime influence in his union, and despaired of keeping his local out of criminal hands. Nathan Riesel was severely beaten by gangsters in 1942, and died five years later (in part due to the injuries suffered during and surgeries related to this attack).\n\nVictor Riesel's labor journalism career formally began in 1937 when he started writing a regular column on labor union issues.\n\nHe was hired by \"The New York Post\" in 1941. His column became nationally syndicated in 1942. He left the \"Post\" in 1948 after a change in management, and joined William Randolph Hearst's \"New York Daily Mirror\". Within eight years, his column was syndicated in 193 newspapers.\n\nHis investigation of Communist Party infiltration of the National Maritime Union led Representative Louis B. Heller to introduce legislation in 1951 to investigate the charges. In 1951 and 1952, Riesel provided Senator Pat McCarran with information that led to a Senate investigation into communist influence in the United Public Workers of America. In 1952, he publicly alleged before the Subcommittee on Internal Security (led at the time by Sen. McCarran) that Local 65 of the Distributive, Processing and Office Workers of America was controlled by the Communist Party. The same year, he denounced Gambino crime family member Anthony \"Tough Tony\" Anastasio for engaging in labor racketeering. Anastasio sued Riesel for $1 million for libel, but the suit was thrown out of court.\n\nOn February 6, 1953, Riesel spoke with New York University philosophy professor Sidney Hook and others on \"The Threat to Academic Freedom\" in the evening on WEVD radio.\n\nIn 1956, Riesel began working with United States Attorney Paul Williams to rein in labor racketeering in the New York City garment and trucking industries.\n\nOn April 5, 1956, an assailant threw sulphuric acid into Riesel's face as he was leaving Lindy's (a famous restaurant in Manhattan). Riesel had been reporting on corruption in the International Union of Operating Engineers and its then-President, William C. DeKoning, Jr. He had recently alleged that DeKoning was conspiring with Joseph S. Fay (a convicted labor racketeer and extortionist) to re-establish his father, William C. DeKoning, Sr. (who had recently been freed from prison after serving a sentence for extortion) as president of the union. Although Riesel had received numerous death and other threats over the past few months, he had dismissed them as the work of \"cranks.\"\n\nThe attack occurred shortly after a Riesel radio broadcast. Barry Gray, radio station WMCA's overnight talk radio host, had asked Riesel to substitute for him. Riesel invited two IUOE Local 138 leaders who were challenging the DeKonings for control of the local union to join him for the broadcast. The broadcast originated from Hutton's Restaurant at 47th Street and Lexington Avenue shortly after midnight on April 5, and concluded at 2 AM. Afterward, Riesel and his secretary went to Lindy's restaurant, located on Broadway between 49th Street and 50th Street. They had coffee, and departed Lindy's at 3 AM to walk to the secretary's automobile. Riesel removed his eyeglasses, which he did by habit when in public. A slender, black-haired man in blue and white jacket stepped out of the shadows of the entrance to the Mark Hellinger Theatre and threw a vial of sulphuric acid into Riesel's eyes. Riesel shouted, \"My gosh! My gosh!\", and clutched at his face. While the secretary and others rendered assistance and dragged Riesel into Lindy's, the assailant walked calmly away.\n\nThe acid struck Riesel's right eye more than the left. Riesel's eyes were flushed with water inside Lindy's, but patrons stopped administering aid for fear of doing further damage. Riesel was taken to St. Clare's Hospital on East 71st Street, where doctors worked to save his vision. Measures to counteract the acid were not taken until Riesel arrived at St. Clare's, 40 minutes after the attack. On May 4, doctors said that Riesel had completely lost his sight (see the right photograph in the infobox, above). In December 1956, Riesel described the amount of acid as a \"deluge\" which covered most of his cheeks, eyes, and forehead. Portions of Riesel's face (see right photo, above, compared to left photo, particularly the left cheek, jaw line, and jowls; the eyebrows; and the forehead) were permanently scarred as well. Riesel wore dark glasses for the rest of his life to hide his damaged eyes, which many people found difficult to look at.\n\nThe \"Daily Mirror\" immediately offered a $10,000 reward for information identifying the assailant and leading to his conviction. The Newspaper Guild of New York, New York Press Photographers Association, Overseas Press Club, New York Newspaper Reporters Association, and the Society of Silurians (an organization of veteran New York City journalists) immediately raised the reward to $15,000. By week's end, donations from labor unions, radio station WMCA, and other groups had increased the reward to $41,000.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified Abraham Telvi as the assailant in August 1956, but Telvi had been murdered on July 28, 1956, by mobsters for demanding an additional $50,000 on top of the $500 he had already received for the crime. On August 29, 1956, Genovese crime family underboss Johnny Dio was arrested for conspiracy in the Riesel attack, pleaded not guilty, and was released on $100,000 bond even though prosecutors later publicly linked him to the Telvi murder.\n\nJoseph Carlino, a Dio associate who had hired Telvi to attack Riesel, pleaded guilty on October 22, and prosecutors severed Dio's trial from the others. Carlino later testified that Dio had ordered Genovese mob associate Gandolfo Miranti to find a hitman and identify Riesel, and that Miranti had contacted Dominick Bando to assist him in finding the hitman (Bando contacting Carlino, who sought out Telvi). Miranti and Bando were then found guilty (Bando pleading guilty at the last moment). Conspiracy charges against Dio were later dropped despite the convictions. Dio's attorney delayed the trial for nearly five months with motions. When the trial finally began, Carlino and Miranti recanted their pre-trial statements and courtroom testimony, claiming they did not know who had ordered the attack on Riesel. By September 1957, the government no longer sought to prosecute Dio for the attack. Miranti received 8 to 16 years in prison and Bando 2 to 5 years in prison for the acid attack and another five years for contempt of court. Carlino received a suspended sentence for cooperating with the prosecution, and three other co-conspirators were freed after the judge in their case declared a mistrial. The \"Daily Mirror\" paid one witness $5,000 in 1961 for information leading to the identification of Abraham Telvi as the assailant.\n\nThe attack on Riesel had significant implications for national American labor policy. President Dwight Eisenhower (who had seen Riesel on \"Meet the Press\") told AFL-CIO President George Meany that he was so incensed by the attack on Riesel that he intended to introduce legislation designed to root out corruption in labor unions. Clark R. Mollenhoff, editor of the \"Des Moines Register\", was so alarmed by the attack on Riesel that he ordered extensive investigations into trade union corruption. Mollenhoff's investigative efforts unearthed much evidence that Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa was engaged in labor racketeering. The attack also convinced Robert F. Kennedy, then chief legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Government Operations, to lead an investigation into labor racketeering. Kennedy's investigations (as well as subsequent labor scandals) led to the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management. This committee's investigations led directly to the passage of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, which imposed financial reporting requirements on labor unions, limited the power of trusteeships, established many member and employer rights, and created additional unfair labor practices governing unions.\n\nThe acid attack vastly boosted Riesel's national popularity. He began a regular television program on WRCA-TV, and a regular weekly radio program on WEVD. He continued to write his column, typing it himself while his wife read newspapers and wire service articles to him.\n\nRiesel was a militant anti-communist. Initially, his views focused on both fascism and communism. As early as 1939, he joined John Dewey's newly formed Committee for Cultural Freedom, which was opposed to totalitarianism in all its forms. In 1941, he told the Union for Democratic Action that Rep. Martin Dies, Jr. was intent on establishing a national fascist police force to suppress freedom of speech in the United States.\n\nRiesel's attacks on fascism lessened after World War II, and he focused almost exclusively on communism after 1950. Riesel's attacks on communism extended beyond labor unions. He attacked folk musician Vern Partlow for promoting communism and undermining American national security with his 1945 talking blues song \"Atomic Talking Blues\" (also known as \"Talking Atom\" and \"Old Man Atom\"). In 1949, he was named a director of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding Anti-Communist China, a part of the China Lobby. At least one author alleges that Riesel even cooperated with the Central Intelligence Agency beginning in the early 1950s, providing information on liberal politicians and union leaders. In the early 1950s, he supported a movement to stop the importation of goods from the Soviet Union into the United States, and for a time longshoremen on the East Coast refused to unload Soviet ships due to Riesel's campaign. During the height of McCarthyism in the early 1950s, he also became interested in purging homosexuals from federal civil service. He publicly called for a \"preventive war\" with the Soviet Union in 1951, and demanded that President Harry S. Truman drop the atomic bomb on Russia and China. He strongly criticized Malcolm X for meeting with Shirley Graham Du Bois and Julian Mayfield in the mid-1960s, and accused Malcolm X of fomenting communist conspiracies. In the early 1970s, Riesel became an unofficial advisor to President Richard Nixon. He supported Nixon in his column, discussed labor union issues and outreach to working-class voters with him personally over the phone, and occasionally met with Cabinet members. Even as late as 1973, Riesel was defending COINTELPRO, a series of covert and often illegal projects conducted by the FBI aimed at investigating and disrupting dissident political organizations in the U.S.\n\nRiesel was intimately involved in the Hollywood blacklist of the late 1940s and 1950s. He strongly criticized Samuel Fuller's 1951 Korean War film \"The Steel Helmet\" for promoting communism and portraying American soldiers as murderers. He also attacked the 1954 pro-union film \"Salt of the Earth\" as communistic, and implied that the production's on-location proximity to Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Nevada Test Site was a cover for Soviet spying on the American nuclear weapons program. Riesel saw it as his patriotic duty to publicize allegations of communist influence made against actors, directors, producers, and others (especially those claims made by conservative actors Adolphe Menjou and Ward Bond). As the blacklist lifted, Riesel agreed to allow his column to become a means for blacklisted individuals to admit their offenses, denounce communism, and become active in the motion picture industry again. Along with Hedda Hopper and Walter Winchell, he would meet privately with these individuals, assess the sincerity of their penance, and then work with them to help rehabilitate their careers if he believed they were being honest with him.\n\nVictor Riesel retired from the \"Daily Mirror\" in 1963 but continued to publish his syndicated column. Three men who leased coin-operated pool tables to establishments in California sued Riesel for libel in 1965, alleging that his column on racketeering in the vending industry defamed them.\n\nRiesel was elected a director of the Overseas Press Club in 1962, and the organization's president in 1966 (he served a single one-year term).\n\nRiesel retired his column in 1990.\n\nRiesel married the former Evelyn Lobelson after graduating from college. The couple had a son, Michael, in 1942 and a daughter, Susan, in 1949.\n\nRiesel died of cardiac arrest at his apartment in Manhattan aged 81. His wife, son, and daughter survived him.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his songs \"I Want to Sing in Opera\" and \"The Night Watchman\".\n\nBard was born in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, Lancashire. He began as an amateur singer and comedian, aged 21, and his acts included the part of a coon singer and a character who had a bald head and who wore a black spot on each eyebrow. He also performed in female character roles, specifically with his hit song \"I Want to Sing in Opera\". Bard had a long career in pantomime and introduced tongue twisters such as \"She sells seashells by the seashore\", based on a song he performed in the show \"Dick Whittington and His Cat\" in Drury Lane in 1908. In 1919 he went to America where he performed in vaudeville, making his debut at the Palace Theatre on 20 October that year; the show was not well received. He stayed with the production and after a few alterations to the script, he became a hit. \n\nHe performed in Australia in 1921. In 1923, Bard appeared with Jack Pearl in tests for Lee de Forest's sound-on-film process Phonofilm. This short film is in the collection of the UCLA Film and Television Archive. In 1928, Bard appeared in two short films made in Phonofilm, \"The Cleaner\" and \"The Night Watchman\", which may be in the collection of the British Film Institute.\n\nBard was married to Ellen Smith (née Stratton), who performed using the stage name Nellie Stratton.

He was held hostage, tortured and eventually murdered by his captors.\n\nWilliam Higgins was born in Danville, Kentucky on January 15, 1945. He graduated from Southern High School in Louisville and earned his Bachelor's degree from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. A scholarship student in the Navy ROTC, he received the Marine Corps Association Award and was commissioned in the Marine Corps in 1967. He later obtained Master's degrees from Pepperdine University and Auburn University. He graduated from the Army Infantry Officers Advanced Course, the Air Force Command and Staff College, and the National War College.\n\nAs a lieutenant, he participated in combat operations during 1968 with C Company, 1st Battalion 3rd Marines in the Republic of Vietnam as a rifle platoon commander and rifle company executive officer, and was aide-de-camp to the Assistant 3rd Marine Division Commander.\n\nReturning to the States, Lt. Higgins served at Headquarters Marine Corps in 1969. In 1970, he served as the Officer-in-Charge of the Officer Selection Team in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nCaptain Higgins returned to Vietnam in 1972 as an infantry battalion advisor to the Vietnamese Marine Division, then in 1973 served as a rifle company commander with B Company, 1st Battalion 4th Marines.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1977, Captain Higgins served at the Staff Noncommissioned Officers Academy and Officer Candidate School, both in Quantico, Virginia.\n\nReturning to the Fleet Marine Force in 1977, Capt. Higgins was assigned to the 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, where he again served as a rifle company commander with A Company, 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines. Upon promotion to major, he was reassigned as the Logistics Officer for Regimental Landing Team 2, 4th Marine Amphibious Brigade.\n\nAfter completion of the Air Force Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base in 1980, designated a distinguished graduate, Higgins returned to Washington, D.C. where he served at Headquarters as a Plans Officer until his selection to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n\nDuring 1981 and 1982, he served as Military Assistant to the Special Assistant to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, then as Assistant for Interagency Matters to the Executive Secretary for the Department of Defense. After graduation from the National War College in 1985, he returned to the Pentagon as the Military Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, where he served until he was transferred to his United Nations assignment in July 1987. He was promoted to Colonel on March 1, 1989, while in captivity.\n\nOn February 17, 1988, Higgins disappeared while serving as the Chief, Observer Group Lebanon and Senior Military Observer, United Nations Military Observer Group, United Nations Truce Supervision Organization. Higgins was driving alone on the coastal highway between Tyre and Naqoura in southern Lebanon, returning from a meeting with a local leader of the Amal movement, when he was pulled from his vehicle by armed men who it is suspected were affiliated with Hezbollah. During his captivity, he was interrogated and tortured.\n\nAs a reaction to his abduction, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 618, demanding his release. A year and a half after his abduction, images of his body, hanged by the neck, were televised around the world from a videotape released by his captors. The exact date of Higgins' murder is uncertain; he was declared dead on July 6, 1990. His remains were recovered on December 23, 1991, by Major Jens Nielsen of the Royal Danish Army, who was attached to the United Nations Observation Group in Beirut. Higgins' remains were found beside a mosque near a south Beirut hospital. His remains were interred at Quantico National Cemetery, Triangle, Virginia, on December 30, 1991.\n\nHiggins' military decorations include: the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star with combat \"V\", Purple Heart, Meritorious Service Medal, Navy Commendation Medal with gold star and combat \"V\", Combat Action Ribbon, Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with silver star, Staff Service Honor Medal, United Nations Medal, and numerous unit commendations and campaign ribbons.\n\nOn March 18, 1992, President George Bush awarded Higgins the Presidential Citizens Medal (posthumous). The medal was accepted by his wife, Robin, and daughter, Chrissy. Higgins was also survived by two sisters.\n\nOn February 17, 1994, the Secretary of the Navy announced a new \"Arleigh Burke\"-class guided missile destroyer would be named for Higgins. On October 4, 1997, the was christened by Higgins' widow, Robin Higgins and commissioned on April 24, 1999.\n\nIn April 2003, he was posthumously granted a Prisoner of War Medal. DoD General Counsel Judith A. Miller initially blocked the award in 1998 based on the claim that \"circumstances do not appear to meet the criteria established by Congress for award of the Prisoner of War Medal.\" The Navy later overruled her after it was determined that the 1989 expansion of the eligibility criteria allowed the award.\n"}
{"id": "16667210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16667210", "title": "Youth suicide", "text": "Youth suicide\n\nYouth suicide is when a young person, generally categorized as someone below age 21, deliberately ends their own life. Rates of attempted and completed youth suicide in Western societies and other countries are high. Youth suicide attempts are more common among girls, but adolescent males are the ones who usually carry out suicide. Suicide rates in youths have nearly tripled between the 1960s and 1980s. For example, in Australia suicide is second only to motor vehicle accidents as its leading cause of death for people aged 15–25, and according to the National Institute for Mental Health, suicide is the third leading cause of death among teens in the United States.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian in 2007, 39% of all youth suicides are completed by young people who have lost someone of influence or significance to them to suicide. The Commission terms this suicide contagion and makes several recommendations as to the importance of safeguarding young people and communities from suicide contagion.\n\nIn 2011 the Australian Federal Parliament Standing Committee for Health and Ageing Inquiry into Youth Suicide met in a round table forum with young representatives from three organisations at the forefront of preventing youth suicide. These organizations included Sunnykids, Inspire, and Boys Town. The Standing Committee has since released a discussion paper highlighting the findings of their inquiry and will seek to make final recommendations on the most effective means for reducing youth suicide.\n\nOne of the problems facing teenagers at risk of suicide is getting psychiatric counseling when it's needed. One study says, \"In teenagers, depression is considered a major - if not the leading - cause of teen suicide.\" Factors and risks contributed to youth suicide are academic pressure, alcohol consumption, the loss of a valued relationship, frequent change of residency, and poor family patterns. Harassment is a leading cause of teen suicide, along with abuse. Gay teens or those unsure of their sexual identity are more likely to commit suicide, particularly if they have suffered bullying or harassment, as discussed next. The following campaigns have been started in hopes of giving teens hope and abolishing the feeling of isolation.\nLack of impulse control has been found to differentiate adolescent suicide attempters from a control group of adolescents with an acute illness (Slap, Vorters, Chaudhuri, & Centor, 1988). However, impulsivity does not characterize all suicide attempters, since group comparisons have found no differences between suicidal patients and psychiatric controls on a measure of cognitive impulsivity (Patsiokas, Clum, & Luscomb, 1979). Instead, impulsivity may be important in identifying high risk subgroups.\n\nYouth that fall under the category of sexual minorities are at an elevated risk of depression and succumbing to self-harm. Among the population of sexual minority youth, on average, 28% explain having past experiences with suicidal actions and/or thoughts. Lesbian and gay youth are the group most likely to face negative experiences, leading to a higher likelihood of the development of suicidal thoughts according to mental care professionals. Bisexuality also carries a higher likelihood of suicidality with bisexuals being 5 times more likely to report suicidal thoughts and actions. Sexual minority youth also report a higher incidence of substance abuse when compared to heterosexuals. Overall, studies suggest that sexual minority youth carry a higher incidence of suicide and depression.\n\nExposure to suicide, previous attempts of suicide, and age are some of the most influential factors of young individuals and their probability of dying by suicide. Adolescent exposure to suicide through classmates has caused researchers to hypothesize suicide as a contagion. They note how a child’s exposure to suicide predicts suicide ideation and attempts. Previous exposure to suicide through parental attempts have also been found to have a 3.5 increase in a youth’s probability of having suicidal thoughts, with a 2.6 increased chance of them attempting suicide. Aggression in families and its transference can be one of the main causes of transmission of suicidal tendencies in families.\n\nPrevious attempts of suicide also play a major role in a youth attempting suicide again. On average, it has been recorded that the follow-up period for suicide-attempters was 3.88 years. Evidence shows those most at risk for suicide are those who previously attempted suicide, with research showing that they can have anywhere from a 40 to over a 100 times higher chance of dying by suicide compared to the general population.\n\nAge and experience also factor into suicide. It has been found that older, more experienced populations take more time to plan, choose deadlier methods, and have greater suicidal intent. This results in them eventually committing suicide at a higher rate than their younger counterparts.\n\nThe primary goals of suicide postvention include assisting the survivors of suicide with the grief process, along with identifying and referring those survivors who may be at risk for negative outcomes such as depressive and anxiety disorders, and suicidal behaviour. With 42% of completed youth suicides being suicide bereavement (or contagion) related - further research and investment must be made into supporting this group of people. A few suggestions to make sure the support is effective include making the individuals feel connected and understood.\n\nTwo possible determinants to suicide attempts are lifetime sexual abuse and adult physical violence. Among participants aged 18–25, the odds ratios for lifetime sexual abuse and adult physical violence are 4.27 and 3.85, respectively. In other words, those who committed suicide are 327% more likely to have experienced lifetime sexual assault. Similarly, a suicide victim is 285% more likely to have suffered physical violence as an adult. Based on a survey done on American high school students, 16% reported considering suicide and 8% reported attempting suicide sometime within the 12 months before taking the survey. Between 1980 and 1994, the suicide rates of young black males doubled. American Indians and Alaska Natives commit suicide at a higher rate than any other ethnic group in the United States. In India, one-third of suicides are young people 15–29. In 2002, 154,000 suicides were recorded in India. In the United States, about 60 percent of suicides are carried out with a gun. Some Aboriginal teens and gay or lesbian teens are at high risk, depending on their community and their own self-esteem. Several campaigns have been started to give them hope and help them to feel less isolated.\n\nOne organization in Australia has found that young people who feel connected, supported and understood are less likely to commit suicide. Reports on the attitudes of young people identified as at risk of suicide have been released. Such reports support the notion that connectedness, a sense of being supported and respected, is a protective factor for young people at risk of suicide. According to Pueblo Suicide Prevention Center (PSPC) for some reason kids today are experiencing more pressure.\n\nIntervention issues for communities to address include: suicide contagion, developmental understanding of suicide, development and suicide risk, and the influence of culture. Key matters in postvention responses for young people include: community context, life stage relevance of responses, identification and referral (Postvention Co-ordination), developing a suite of services, and creating ongoing options.\n\nOne can help prevent adolescent suicide by discouraging isolation, addressing a child's depression which is correlated with suicide, getting rid of any objects that a child could use to commit suicide, and simply paying attention to what the child does or feels.\n\nSchools are a great place to provide more education and support on suicide prevention. Since students spend a majority of their time at school, school can be either a haven from or a source of suicidal triggers, and students' peers can heavily influence their state of mind. The school setting is an ideal environment to educate students on suicide and have support readily available.\n\nInformation taken from \"World Psychiatry\", the official journal of the World Psychiatric Association.\n\n\n"}
