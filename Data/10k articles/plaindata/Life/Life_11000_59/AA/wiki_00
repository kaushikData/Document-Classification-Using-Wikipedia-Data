{"id": "27992090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27992090", "title": "Animal suicide", "text": "Animal suicide\n\nAnimal suicide refers to any kind of self-destructive behavior displayed by various species of animals, resulting in their death. Although contradicting the natural progression of life and an animal's evolutionary instinct for survival, some situations may lead to an animal inducing their own death. Animal suicide in the defense of the group could be instantaneous or altruistic self-removal once an animal becomes diseased. There are anecdotal reports of grieving pets displaying such behaviour after the death of their owner, or monogamous animals refusing to feed after the death of their mate.\n\nSome parasites manipulate the behavior of their host, causing them to expose themselves to greater risks of predation to enable the parasite to proceed to the next life-cycle stage. Some carpenter ants and termites use autothysis, producing a sticky secretion to trap colony marauders, and pea aphids will sometimes explode, protecting other pea aphids from ladybugs.\n\nIt is generally considered that humans are the only known beings to use weapons when putting an end to their own life. Some species might be driven to engage in suicidal behavior for the sake of others, this is an example of altruism in animals. These actions are performed when the reproductive fitness of others outweighs the reproductive fitness of the individual. There are examples of animals dying in defense of their family or colony, such as the case of pea aphids increasing their chances of death as a response to parasitism. Vervent monkeys will alert others when a predator is near, consequently drawing attention to itself and increasing their likelihood of being attacked.\n\nMany animals that appear to be depressed or grieving begin to exhibit self-destructive behavior that sometimes ends in death. In 1845, the \"Illustrated London News\" reported that a Newfoundland dog had been acting less lively over a period of days before being seen \"to throw himself in the water and endeavor to sink by preserving perfect stillness of the legs and feet\". Every time he was rescued he attempted to do this again before he finally held his head underwater until death. Other dogs, as well as ducks, have also drowned themselves. One duck did so after the death of its mate. Some dogs will refuse food after the death of their owner until they die as well. Although, the death of mourning animals is likely to be caused by depression leading to starvation or drowning, instead of the intent of suicide. In 2009, 28 cows and bulls mysteriously threw themselves off a cliff in the Swiss Alps over the span of three days. One deer leapt from a cliff to its death so as to avoid being captured by hunting dogs. Another famous example of animal suicide is the case of the dolphin which most often portrayed Flipper, on the 1960s television show \"Flipper\". According to trainer Richard O' Barry in the film \"The Cove,\" Kathy, the dolphin, suffocated herself before him. Suicidal behavior has been observed more in female animals than male and in more vertebrates than invertebrates.\n\nAnimal suicide was long used to define human suicide; in the 1800s animal suicide was seen as an act of abuse, madness, love, or loyalty, the same acts human suicide was seen as. Although it is impossible to determine what drives animals to self-destruction, some specific traits associated with human suicide can be successfully transferred to animals. Scientists have been unable to explain whether animals are able to consciously end their own lives.\n\nSome species of social insects will commit suicide in an act of altruism through autothysis. These insects will sacrifice themselves if the colony is in danger, to alert the colony of danger, or if they become diseased they will sacrifice themselves to prevent the colony from becoming diseased. Carpenter ants and some species of termite will rupture glands and expel a sticky toxic substance thought to be an aliphatic compound in a process called \"autothysis\". Termites will use autothysis to defend their colony, as the ruptured gland produces a sticky harmful secretion that leads to a tar baby effect in defense. When threatened by a ladybug, the pea aphid will explode itself, protecting other aphids and sometimes killing the ladybug. Another example is the \"Camponotus saundersi,\" or Malaysian worker ant, which is capable of committing suicide by exploding.\n\nSome social Hymenoptera including bees, wasps, and ants, may use their stinger to deliver poisonous chemicals to their attacker, effectively killing both the predator and the insect in the colony's defense. This self-destructive and often altruistic defense is known as sting autonomy. The stinger is easily torn from the animal's body, allowing the hazardous stinger to be left stuck in the predator.\n\nCertain types of parasites will cause their hosts to commit suicidal behavior, through altering how the intermediate host acts. The change in the host's actions often benefit the parasite's search for a final host. A main example is the phylum Acanthocephala, which will direct its host to a predator so as to be eaten by the predator, their new definitive host. The parasitic worm \"Spinochordodes tellinii\" will develop in grasshoppers and crickets until it is grown, at which time it will cause its host to leap into water to its death so that the worm can reproduce in water. However, \"S. tellinii\" only causes its host to drown when the host is already close to water as opposed to seeking it out over large distances.\n\nInfection with \"Toxoplasma gondii\" has been shown to alter the behavior of mice and rats in ways thought to increase the rodents’ chances of being preyed upon by cats. Infected rodents show a reduction in their innate aversion to cat odors; while uninfected mice and rats will generally avoid areas marked with cat urine or with cat body odor, this avoidance is reduced or eliminated in infected animals. Moreover, some evidence suggests this loss of aversion may be specific to feline odors: when given a choice between two predator odors (cat or mink), infected rodents show a significantly stronger preference to cat odors than do uninfected controls.\n\nSuicide induction in intermediate hosts has been shown to help disperse the parasites to their final hosts. The intermediate host of \"Parvatrema affinis\" is the bivalve mollusc, \"Macoma balthica\". The clam feed when in the sublittoral and tidal flat muds, and usually leave no conspicuous marks in the mud that could indicate their presence. However, infected clams are concentrated in the higher parts of the tidal flats, closer to shore, and leave conspicuous zig-zag markings in the sand. Visual and tactile cues have shown to be used by oyster catchers and other shore birds, the definitive hosts of the parasite.\n\nA popular misconception is that the lemming will commit mass suicide during migration. This misconception was first popularized by media in the 1960s, such as a mention in the Cyril M. Kornbluth short story \"The Marching Morons\" in 1951 and the 1955 comic \"The Lemming with the Locket\", inspired by a 1953 \"American Mercury\" article. Perhaps one of the most influential factors in this misconception was the Academy Award-winning Disney film \"White Wilderness\", which showed staged footage of lemmings jumping off a cliff during migration.\n\n"}

His origin has never been revealed, but he has super-human strength and limited invulnerability as long as he stays in contact with the natural earth. He fought Geo-Force of The Outsiders who defeated him. He resurfaced with the rest of the New Olympians as victims of Gog.\n\nMark Antaeus was the son of a scientist who injected Mark with experimental growth hormones as he grew up. Because of these hormones Mark pushed the boundaries of human agility, strength and endurance although never becoming truly superhuman.\n\nMark became a fireman and a local hero, idolising Superman to the extent that he had a large 'S-shield' tattoo across his back (This shield was the one worn by Superman in Kingdom Come foreshadowing the dark turn Mark would take). After failing to rescue a family caught in a burning building Mark had something of a nervous breakdown, disappearing for over two years. When he returned it was revealed he had volunteered to STAR Labs as a guinea pig for cybernetic enhancements. Despite being horribly disfigured under his cybernetic armour the hero 'Antaeus' was blissfully happy to be able to help people and this small town hero's exploits came to the Justice League's attention. He was quickly admitted to the JLA and shown to partake in many adventures.\n\nAntaeus' behaviour was somewhat erratic and he came into conflict with Green Lantern, Kyle Rayner who feels that he is unreasonably driven and dotes on his idol, Superman. He also draws away from his human life, cutting off his family and fiancee.\n\nWhen the JLA refuse to step in to remove a Middle Eastern despot, Antaeus goes against their wishes, overthrowing a hostile government and murdering their leader (who bears a striking resemblance to Saddam Hussein). Antaeus then comes into direct conflict with the JLA, he puts up a good fight but his cybernetic systems are badly damaged and he retreats. Seeing that his actions have destabilized the country and ultimately made things worse for its citizens, Antaeus is consumed with grief and regret and lets his damaged nuclear reactor (the source of his power) explode.\n\nIn an epilogue we see Superman's grief over his inability to help Mark and Mark's Helmet is placed in the JLA trophy room.\n\nApart from his starring role in the one shot \"JLA: Superpower\", Antaeus' only other appearance was in the JLA/Avengers crossover in which all previous members of the JLA and the Avengers appear.\n"}
{"id": "44023804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44023804", "title": "Anthropopithecus", "text": "Anthropopithecus\n\nThe terms Anthropopithecus (Blainville, 1839) and Pithecanthropus (Haeckel, 1868) are obsolete taxa describing either chimpanzees or archaic humans. Both are derived from Greek ἄνθρωπος (anthropos, \"man\") and πίθηκος (píthēkos, \"ape\" or \"monkey\"), translating to \"man-ape\" and \"ape-man\", respectively.\n\n\"Anthropopithecus\" was originally coined to describe the chimpanzee and is now a junior synonym of \"Pan\". It had been also used to describe several other extant and extinct species, among others the fossil Java Man. Very quickly, the latter was re-assigned to \"Pithecanthropus\", originally coined to refer to a theoretical \"missing link\". \"Pithecanthropus\" is now classed as \"Homo erectus\", thus a junior synonym of \"Homo\".\n\nThe genus \"Anthropopithecus\" was first proposed in 1839 by the French zoologist and anatomist Henri-Marie Ducrotay de Blainville (1777–1850) in order to give a genus name to some chimpanzee material that he was studying at the time.\n\nAfter the genus \"Anthropopithecus\" was established by De Blainville in 1839, the British surgeon and naturalist John Bland-Sutton (1855–1936) proposed the species name \"Anthropopithecus troglodytes\" in 1883 to designate the common chimpanzee. However, the genus \"Pan\" had already been attributed to chimpanzees in 1816 by the German naturalist Lorenz Oken (1779–1851). Since any earlier nomenclature prevails over subsequent nomenclatures, the genus \"Anthropopithecus\" definitely lost its validity in 1895, becoming from that date a junior synonym of the genus \"Pan\".\n\nIn 1879, the French archaeologist and anthropologist Gabriel de Mortillet (1821–1898) proposed the term \"Anthropopithecus\" to designate a \"missing link\", a hypothetical intermediate between ape and man that lived in the Tertiary and that supposedly, following De Mortillet's theory, produced eoliths. In his work of 1883 \"Le Préhistorique, antiquité de l<nowiki>'</nowiki>homme\" (\"The Prehistoric: Man's Antiquity\", below quoted after the 2nd edition, 1885), De Mortillet writes:\n\nWhen in 1905 the French paleontologist, paleoanthropologist and geologist Marcellin Boule (1861–1942) published a paper demonstrating that the eoliths were in fact geofacts produced by natural phenomena (freezing, pressure, fire), the argument proposed by De Mortillet fell into disrepute and his definition of the term \"Anthropopithecus\" was dropped. Yet the chimpanzee meaning of the genus persisted throughout the 19th century, even to the point of being a genus name attributed to fossil specimens. For example, a fossil primate discovered in 1878 by the British malacologist William Theobald (1829-1908) in the Pakistani Punjab in British India was first named \"Palaeopithecus\" in 1879 but later renamed \"Anthropopithecus sivalensis\", assuming that these remains had to be brought back to the chimpanzee genus as the latter was being understood at the time. A famous example of a fossil \"Anthropopithecus\" is that of the Java Man, discovered in 1891 in Trinil, nearby the Solo River, in East Java, by Dutch physician and anatomist Eugène Dubois, who named the discovery with the scientific name \"Anthropopithecus erectus\". This Dubois paper, written during the last quarter of 1892, was published by the Dutch government in 1893. In those early 1890s, the term \"Anthropopithecus\" was still being used by zoologists as the genus name of chimpanzees, so Dubois' \"Anthropopithecus erectus\" came to mean something like \"the upright chimpanzee\", or \"the chimpanzee standing up\". However, a year later, in 1893, Dubois considered that some anatomical characters proper to humans made necessary the attribution of these remains to a genus different than \"Anthropopithecus\" and he renamed the specimen of Java with the name \"Pithecanthropus erectus\" (1893 paper, published in 1894). \"Pithecanthropus\" is a genus that German biologist Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919) had created in 1868. Years later, in the 20th century, the German physician and paleoanthropologist Franz Weidenreich (1873-1948) compared in detail the characters of Dubois' Java Man, then named \"Pithecanthropus erectus\", with the characters of the Peking Man, then named \"Sinanthropus pekinensis\". Weidenreich concluded in 1940 that because of their anatomical similarity with modern humans it was necessary to gather all these specimens of Java and China in a single species of the genus \"Homo\", the species \"Homo erectus\". By that time, the genus \"Anthropopithecus\" had already been abandoned since 1895 at the earliest.\n\nThe term \"Anthropopithecus\" is scientifically obsolete in the present day but did become widespread in popular culture, mainly in France and Belgium:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "339404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339404", "title": "Charley Chase", "text": "Charley Chase\n\nCharley Chase (born Charles Joseph Parrott, October 20, 1893 – June 20, 1940) was an American comedian, actor, screenwriter and film director best known for his work in Hal Roach short film comedies. He was the older brother of comedian/director James Parrott.\n\nBorn Charles Joseph Parrott in Baltimore, Maryland, Charley Chase began performing in vaudeville as a teenager and started his career in films by working at the Christie Film Company in 1912. He then moved to Keystone Studios, where he began appearing in bit parts in the Mack Sennett films, including those of Charlie Chaplin. By 1915 he was playing juvenile leads in the Keystones, and directing some of the films as Charles Parrott. His Keystone credentials were good enough to get him steady work as a comedy director with other companies; he directed many of Chaplin imitator Billy West's comedies, which featured a young Oliver Hardy as villain.\n\nHe worked at L-KO Kompany during its final months of existence. Then in 1920, Chase began working as a film director for Hal Roach Studios. Among his notable early works for Roach was supervising the first entries in the \"Our Gang\" series, as well as directing several films starring Lloyd Hamilton; like many other silent comedians, Chase is reported to have regarded Hamilton's work as a major influence on that of his own. Chase became director-general of the Hal Roach studio in late 1921, supervising the production of all the Roach series except the Harold Lloyd comedies. Following Lloyd's departure from the studio in 1923, Chase moved back in front of the camera with his own series of shorts, adopting the screen name Charley Chase.\n\nChase was a master of the comedy of embarrassment, and he played either hapless young businessmen or befuddled husbands in dozens of situation comedies. His screen persona was that of a pleasant young man with a dapper mustache and ordinary street clothes; this set him apart from the clownish makeups and crazy costumes used by his contemporaries. His earliest Roach shorts cast him as a hard-luck fellow named \"Jimmie Jump\" in one-reel (10-minute) comedies.\n\nThe first Chase series was successful and expanded to two reels (20 minutes); this would become the standard length for Chase comedies, apart from a few three-reel featurettes later. Direction of the Chase series was taken over by Leo McCarey, who in collaboration with Chase formed the comic style of the series—an emphasis on characterization and farce instead of knockabout slapstick. Some of Chase's starring shorts of the 1920s, particularly \"Mighty Like a Moose\", \"Crazy Like a Fox\", \"Fluttering Hearts\", and \"Limousine Love\", are often considered to be among the finest in silent comedy. Chase remained the guiding hand behind the films, assisting anonymously with the directing, writing, and editing.\n\nChase moved with ease into sound films in 1929 and became one of the most popular film comedians of the period. He continued to be very prolific in the talkie era, often putting his fine singing voice on display and including his humorous, self-penned songs in his comedy shorts. The two-reeler \"The Pip from Pittsburg\", released in 1931 and co-starring Thelma Todd, is one of the most celebrated Charley Chase comedies of the sound era. Throughout the decade, the \"Charley Chase\" shorts continued to stand alongside Laurel and Hardy and Our Gang as the core output of the Roach studio. Chase was featured in the Laurel and Hardy feature \"Sons of the Desert\"; Laurel and Hardy made cameo appearances as hitchhikers in Chase's \"On the Wrong Trek\".\n\n\"On the Wrong Trek\" was supposed to be the final Charley Chase short subject: by 1936 producer Hal Roach was now concentrating on making ambitious feature films. Chase played a character role in the Patsy Kelly feature Kelly the Second, and starred in a feature-length comedy called \"Bank Night\", lampooning the popular Bank Night phenomenon of the 1930s. Chase's feature was plagued with a host of production problems and legalities, and the film was drastically edited down to two reels and finally released as one last Charley Chase short, \"Neighborhood House\". Chase was then dismissed from the Roach studio.\n\nIn 1937, Chase began working at Columbia Pictures, where he spent the rest of his career starring in his own series of two-reel comedies, as well as producing and directing other Columbia comedies, including those of The Three Stooges and Andy Clyde. He directed the Stooges' classic \"Violent Is the Word for Curly\" (1938); although he is often credited with writing the film's song \"Swinging the Alphabet\", the tune actually originates with 19th-century songwriter Septimus Winner. Recent research asserts that the Chase family's maid introduced the song to Chase and taught it to his daughters. Chase's own shorts at Columbia favored broader sight gags and more slapstick than his earlier, subtler work, although he does sing in two of the Columbias, \"The Grand Hooter\" and \"The Big Squirt\" (both 1937). Many of Chase's Columbia short subjects were strong enough to be remade in the 1940s with other comedians; Chase's \"The Heckler\" (1940) was remade with Shemp Howard as \"Mr. Noisy\" (1946) while \"The Nightshirt Bandit\" (1938) was remade with Andy Clyde as \"Go Chase Yourself\" (1948) and again in 1956 as \"Pardon My Nightshirt\".\n\nChase reportedly suffered from depression and alcoholism for most of his professional career, and his tumultuous lifestyle began to take a serious toll on his health. His hair had turned prematurely gray, and he dyed it jet-black for his Columbia comedies. Years later Hal Roach said \"I never saw him drunk at the studio, and I never saw him sober outside of it.\"\n\nHis younger brother, comedy writer-director James Parrott, had personal problems resulting from a drug treatment, and died in 1939. Chase was devastated. He had refused to give his brother money to support his drug habit, and friends knew he felt responsible for Parrott's death. He coped with the loss by throwing himself into his work and by drinking more heavily than ever, despite doctors' warnings. The stress ultimately caught up with him; just over a year after his brother's death, Charley Chase died of a heart attack in Hollywood, California, on June 20, 1940. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery near his wife Bebe Eltinge in Glendale, California.\n\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, Charley Chase received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6630 Hollywood Boulevard on February 8, 1960.\n\nSince the 1990s, there has been a revival of interest in the films of Charley Chase, due in large part to the increased availability of his comedies. An extensive website researching his life and work, \"The World of Charley Chase\", was created in 1996, and a biography, \"Smile When the Raindrops Fall\", was published in 1998.\n\nChase's sound comedies for Hal Roach were briefly televised in the late 1990s on the short-lived American cable network the Odyssey Channel. Retrospectives of Chase's work organized by \"The Silent Clowns Film Series\" were held in 1999, 2001, 2006, and 2008 in New York City.\n\nA marathon of selected Charley Chase shorts from the silent era was broadcast in 2005 on the American cable television network Turner Classic Movies. In late 2006, Turner Classic Movies began to air Charley Chase's sound-era comedies. In January 2011, several of his sound shorts were featured during Turner Classic Movies' tribute to Hal Roach Studios.\n\nIn 2007, \"Mighty Like a Moose\" (1926) was selected for inclusion in the Library of Congress's National Film Registry, solidifying its reputation as one of the most celebrated comedies of the silent era and cementing Chase's status as a pioneer of early film comedy.\n\nKino International released two Charley Chase DVD volumes in 2004 and 2005 for their Slapstick Symposium series. The films came from archives and collectors around the world. In July 2009, VCI Entertainment released \"Becoming Charley Chase\", a DVD boxed set of Charley Chase's early silent films.\n\nColumbia Pictures has prepared digital restorations of its twenty Charley Chase shorts, in the same manner as its Buster Keaton DVD restorations. On January 1, 2013, Sony Home Entertainment released \"Charley Chase Shorts Volume 1\", part of its \"Columbia Choice Collection\" MOD DVD-R library. The one-disc release contains eight of Chase's starring shorts and one Smith & Dale short that he directed, \"A Nag in the Bag\" (1938). On November 5, 2013, Sony Home Entertainment released \"Charley Chase Shorts Volume 2\", another in their MOD DVD-R series, which contained the remaining twelve Chase shorts.\n\n\n"}

Boder\n\nDavid Pablo Boder (9 November 1886 – 18 December 1961) was a Latvian-American professor of psychology at the Illinois Institute of Technology who traveled in 1946 to Europe to record interviews with Holocaust survivors. During that trip, he collected over a hundred interviews totaling 120 hours on a wire recorder developed by fellow professor Dr Marvin Camras. He was the first to record the experiences of the survivors and is a highly noted primary source reference.\n\nBoder was born Aron Mendel Michelson to Berl and Betti (Frank) Michelson, a Jewish family living in Liepāja, Latvia. The large Jewish community residing in Liepāja at that time likely allowed Boder to grow up speaking Yiddish and German, reserving Russian for speaking at school. At around age 19, Boder began studying psychology, first in Leipzig and then St. Petersburg. While living in St. Petersburg, Boder married Pauline Ivianski in 1907, who gave birth to their daughter Elena later that year.

In Mexico, Boder learned to speak Spanish, taught psychology at the National University, and married his third wife Dora in 1925 with whom he moved to the United States soon after. Upon moving to the U.S., Boder obtained degrees from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, while also working at the Lewis Institute (which became Illinois Institute of Technology).\n\nUpon the end of World War II, Boder conceived of a project for interviewing displaced persons of the war, to preserve their stories and investigate the psychological effects of war. In July 1946, Boder arrived in Paris and spent the next nine weeks conducting 130 interviews in 16 locations across France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.\nBy this time, Boder spoke over seven languages, allowing him to conduct interviews in the subjects' native tongue. Most of the subjects were Eastern European Jews, primarily from Poland, but Boder also spoke with Western European Jews, non-observant German Jews, Greek Jews and non-Jewish persons.\n\nIn October 1946, Boder returned to the U.S. and began transcribing the interviews and working on a book manuscript, supported by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. In 1949, a collection of eight transcribed interviews and Boder's analysis was published under the title \"I Did Not Interview the Dead\", though this book sold poorly and went out of print. Boder would continue to work on transcribing the interviews until 1956, when his funding from the National Institute of Mental Health ran out.\n\nIn 1951, Boder interviewed persons displaced by a large flood in Kansas City. In 1952, Boder retired from the Illinois Institute of Technology and relocated with his wife to UCLA as an unpaid research associate. Boder died of a heart attack on December 18, 1961 at age 75.\n"}

{"id": "296059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=296059", "title": "Deontological ethics", "text": "Deontological ethics\n\nIn moral philosophy, deontological ethics or deontology (from Greek δέον, \"deon\", \"obligation, duty\")\nis the normative ethical theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules, rather than based on the consequences of the action.\n\nIt is sometimes described as \"duty-\" or \"obligation-\" or \"rule-\" based ethics, because rules \"bind one to one's duty\". Deontological ethics is commonly contrasted to consequentialism, virtue ethics, and pragmatic ethics. In this terminology, action is more important than the consequences.\n\nIt is an ethical framework that depends on the predefined sets of rules and policies for the proper functioning of a system in the environment. The deontology is simply based on the checklist which includes certain rules to be followed while performing a particular task. According to this framework, the work is considered virtuous only if this checklist is completed.\nThis procedure is very simple to implement and understand. Minimum time is consumed to decide between right and wrong However, its simplicity ignores the consequences of the decision taken under this approach.\n\nThe term \"deontological\" was first used to describe the current, specialised definition by C. D. Broad in his book, \"Five Types of Ethical Theory\", which was published in 1930. Older usage of the term goes back to Jeremy Bentham, who coined it before 1816 as a synonym of \"Dicastic\" or \"Censorial Ethics\" (i.e. ethics based on judgement).\nThe more general sense of the word is retained in French, especially in the term \"code de déontologie\" (ethical code), in the context of professional ethics.\n\nDepending on the system of deontological ethics under consideration, a moral obligation may arise from an external or internal source, such as a set of rules inherent to the universe (ethical naturalism), religious law, or a set of personal or cultural values (any of which may be in conflict with personal desires).\nThere are numerous formulations of deontological ethics.\n\nImmanuel Kant's theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons. First, Kant argues that to act in the morally right way, people must act from duty (\"Pflicht\"). Second, Kant argued that it was not the consequences of actions that make them right or wrong but the motives of the person who carries out the action.\n\nKant's argument that to act in the morally right way one must act purely from duty begins with an argument that the highest good must be both good in itself and good without qualification. Something is \"good in itself\" when it is intrinsically good, and \"good without qualification\", when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as intelligence, perseverance and pleasure, fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears not to be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, this seems to make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good:\nKant then argues that the consequences of an act of willing cannot be used to determine that the person has a good will; good consequences could arise by accident from an action that was motivated by a desire to cause harm to an innocent person, and bad consequences could arise from an action that was well-motivated. Instead, he claims, a person has a good will when he 'acts out of respect for the moral law'. People 'act out of respect for the moral law' when they act in some way \"because\" they have a duty to do so. So, the only thing that is truly good in itself is a good will, and a good will is only good when the willer chooses to do something because it is that person's duty, i.e. out of \"respect\" for the law. He defines respect as \"the concept of a worth which thwarts my self-love\".\n\nKant's three significant formulations of the categorical imperative are:\n\nKant argued that the only absolutely good thing is a good will, and so the single determining factor of whether an action is morally right is the will, or motive of the person doing it. If they are acting on a bad maxim, e.g. \"I will lie\", then their action is wrong, even if some good consequences come of it.\nIn his essay, \"On a Supposed Right to Lie Because of Philanthropic Concerns\", arguing against the position of \nBenjamin Constant, \"Des réactions politiques\", Kant states that \"Hence a lie defined merely as an intentionally untruthful declaration to another man does not require the additional condition that it must do harm to another, as jurists require in their definition (\"mendacium est falsiloquium in praeiudicium alterius\"). For a lie always harms another; if not some human being, then it nevertheless does harm to humanity in general, inasmuch as it vitiates the very source of right [\"Rechtsquelle\"] ... All practical principles of right must contain rigorous truth ... This is because such exceptions would destroy the universality on account of which alone they bear the name of principles.\"\n\nAlthough not all deontologists are religious, some believe in the 'divine command theory', which is actually a cluster of related theories which essentially state that an action is right if God has decreed that it is right. According to Ralph Cudworth, an English philosopher, William of Ockham, René Descartes, and eighteenth-century Calvinists all accepted various versions of this moral theory, as they all held that moral obligations arise from God's commands. The Divine Command Theory is a form of deontology because, according to it, the rightness of any action depends upon that action being performed because it is a duty, not because of any good consequences arising from that action. If God commands people not to work on Sabbath, then people act rightly if they do not work on Sabbath \"because God has commanded that they do not do so\". If they do not work on Sabbath because they are lazy, then their action is not truly speaking \"right\", even though the actual physical action performed is the same. If God commands not to covet a neighbour's goods, this theory holds that it would be immoral to do so, even if coveting provides the beneficial outcome of a drive to succeed or do well.\n\nOne thing that clearly distinguishes Kantian deontologism from divine command deontology is that Kantianism maintains that man, as a rational being, makes the moral law universal, whereas divine command maintains that God makes the moral law universal.\n\n\nContemporary deontologists (scholars born in the first half of the 20th century) include Józef Maria Bocheński, Thomas Nagel, Thomas Scanlon, and Roger Scruton.\n\nBocheński (1965) makes a distinction between deontic and epistemic authority. \nA typical example of epistemic authority in Bocheński's usage would be \"the relation of a teacher to his students\" or \"the relation between an employer and his employee\". A teacher has epistemic authority when making declarative sentences that the student presumes is reliable knowledge and appropriate but feels no obligation to accept or obey; in contrast, an employer has deontic authority in the act of issuing an order that the employee is obliged to accept and obey regardless of its reliability or appropriateness.\n\nFrances Kamm's \"Principle of Permissible Harm\" (1996) is an effort to derive a deontological constraint which coheres with our considered case judgments while also relying heavily on Kant's categorical imperative. The Principle states that one may harm in order to save more if and only if the harm is an effect or an aspect of the greater good itself. This principle is meant to address what Kamm feels are most people's considered case judgments, many of which involve deontological intuitions. \nFor instance, Kamm argues that we believe it would be impermissible to kill one person to harvest his organs in order to save the lives of five others. Yet, we think it is morally permissible to divert a runaway trolley that would otherwise kill five innocent and immobile people onto a side track where one innocent and immobile person will be killed. \nKamm believes the Principle of Permissible Harm explains the moral difference between these and other cases, and more importantly expresses a constraint telling us exactly when we may not act to bring about good ends—such as in the organ harvesting case. \nIn 2007, Kamm published a book that presents new theory that incorporates aspects of her \"Principle of Permissible Harm\", the \"Doctrine of Productive Purity\". Like the \"Principle of Permissible Harm\", the \"Doctrine of Productive Purity\" is an attempt to provide a deontological prescription for determining the circumstances in which people are permitted to act in a way that harms others.\n\nAttempts have been made to reconcile deontology with virtue-based ethics and consequentialism. \nIain King's 2008 book \"How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time\" uses quasi-realism and a modified form of utilitarianism to develop deontological principles which are compatible with ethics based on virtues and consequences. King develops a hierarchy of principles to link his meta-ethics, which are more inclined towards consequentialism, with the deontological conclusions he presents in his book.\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"Dorian Gray syndrome\" refers to the protagonist of the novel \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1891), an exceptionally handsome man whose hedonism and excessive self-love proved detrimental to the personal, social, and emotional aspects of his life, and who sought to escape the ravages of time and his own decadent lifestyle by having a supernatural portrait of himself age in his place.\n\nThe DGS was first described in \"The Dorian Gray Syndrome: Psychodynamic Need for Hair growth Restorers and other \"fountains of youth\"\" (2001), in a symposium about the unrealistic male pursuit of bodily perfection — by means of lifestyle-enhancing drugs, aesthetic surgery, and psychotropic medicines — and its consequences for his mental health as a social being.\n\nThe culturally descriptive name of the syndrome refers to the eponymous protagonist of the novel \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1891), by Oscar Wilde, the story of a very handsome young man who much admires and envies the just-completed portrait of himself, and wishes that it would grow old, rather than he. In order to resist the physical corruptions of time and nature, and unable and unwilling to mature, Dorian Gray \"gives his soul away\", and his wish is granted.\n\nThe oil portrait and the narrative of the novel transgress and cite narcissistic mirror motives; as such, eternal beauty, aging, and maturation are represented with the psychological dyad of \"the person and the mirror\". The personal character of the man Dorian Gray is the background for the clinical description of the Dorian Gray syndrome that afflicts the patient.\n\nThe Dorian Gray syndrome arises from the concurring and overlapping clinical concepts of the narcissistic personality, dysmorphophobia, and paraphilia. Psychodynamically, the man afflicted with DGS presents an interplay among his narcissistic tendencies (\"timeless beauty\"), his arrested development (inability to psychologically mature), and his use of \"medical lifestyle\" products and services — hair restoration, drugs (for impotence, weight-loss, and mood modification), laser dermatology, and plastic surgery — in order to remain young.\n\nAlthough the DGS patient displays diagnostic features of said mental disorders, the syndrome describes a common, underlying psychodynamics of mental illness, which is characterized by narcissistic defences against time-dependent maturation, expressed by actively seeking the timeless beauty of youth. The article \"Das Dorian Gray syndrom\" (2005) reported that approximately 3.0 per cent of the population of Germany present features of the Dorian Gray syndrome.\n\nThe diagnostic criteria for Dorian Gray syndrome are:\n\nEpisodes of major depressive disorder and of suicidal crisis occur in the man afflicted with Dorian Gray syndrome when the defense mechanism activities, the pursuit of eternal youth, fail to indefinitely preserve his handsome face and sculpted physique; usually, anti-depressant drugs and psychotherapy are prescribed and applied to counter his feelings of failure.\n\nFurthermore, if the man misunderstands the self-defensive character of \"acting out\" the DGS, and continues pursuing the timeless beauty of male youth, without being aware of the psychodynamics of narcissism, then he, as a psychiatric patient, establishes a cycle of chronic psychological depression. In extreme cases of DGS, the man seeks self-destruction, by means either of drugs or with plastic surgery, or both, in order to fill the narcissistic emptiness that is the Dorian Gray syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The connectivity and weights of hidden neurons are fixed and randomly assigned. The weights of output neurons can be learned so that the network can (re)produce specific temporal patterns. The main interest of this network is that although its behaviour is non-linear, the only weights that are modified during training are for the synapses that connect the hidden neurons to output neurons. Thus, the error function is quadratic with respect to the parameter vector and can be differentiated easily to a linear system.\n\nAlternatively, one may consider a nonparametric Bayesian formulation of the output layer, under which: (i) a prior distribution is imposed over the output weights; and (ii) the output weights are marginalized out in the context of prediction generation, given the training data. This idea has been demonstrated in by using Gaussian priors, whereby a Gaussian process model with ESN-driven kernel function is obtained. Such a solution was shown to outperform ESNs with trainable (finite) sets of weights in several benchmarks.\n\nSome publicly available implementations of ESNs are: (i) aureservoir: an efficient C++ library for various kinds of echo state networks with python/numpy bindings; and (ii) Matlab code: an efficient matlab for an echo state network.\n\n"}

It is one type of dualism, traditionally a type of substance dualism though more recently also sometimes a form of property dualism.\n\nInteractionism was propounded by the French rationalist philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650), and continues to be associated with him. Descartes posited that the body, being physical matter, was characterized by spatial extension but not by thought and feeling, while the mind, being a separate substance, had no spatial extension but could think and feel. Nevertheless, he maintained that the two interacted with one another, suggesting that this interaction occurred in the pineal gland of the brain.\n\nIn the 20th century, its most significant defenders have been the noted philosopher of science Karl Popper and the neurophysiologist John Carew Eccles. Popper in fact divided reality into three \"worlds\"—the physical, the mental, and objective knowledge (outside the mind)—all of which interact, and Eccles adopted this same \"trialist\" form of interactionism. Other notable recent philosophers to take an interactionist stance have been Richard Swinburne, John Foster, David Hodgson, and Wilfrid Sellars, in addition to the physicist Henry Stapp.\n\nIn his 1996 book \"The Conscious Mind\", David Chalmers rejected interactionism, but in 2002 he reversed his position and listed it along with epiphenomenalism and what he calls \"Type-F monism\" as a position worth examining. Rather than invoking two distinct substances, he defines interactionism as the view that \"microphysics is not causally closed, and that phenomenal properties play a causal role in affecting the physical world.\" (See property dualism.) He argues the most plausible place for consciousness to impact physics is the collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics.\n\nThe \"New Catholic Encyclopedia\" argues that a non-physical mind and mind-body interaction follow necessarily from the Catholic doctrines of the soul and free will.\n\nOne objection often posed to interactionism is the \"problem of causal interaction\" – how the two different substances the theory posits, the mental and the physical, can exert an impact on one another. Descartes' theory that interaction between the mind and the physical world occurred in the pineal gland was seen as inadequate by a number of philosophers in his era, who offered alternate views: Nicholas Malebranche suggested occasionalism, according to which mind and body appear to interact but are in fact moved separately by God, while Gottfried Leibniz argued in \"The Monadology\" that mind and body are in a pre-established harmony. On the other hand, Baruch Spinoza rejected Descartes' dualism and proposed that mind and matter were in fact properties of a single substance, thereby prefiguring the modern perspective of neutral monism.\n\nToday the problem of causal interaction is frequently viewed as a conclusive argument against interactionism. On the other hand, it has been suggested that given many disciplines deal with things they do not entirely understand, dualists not entirely understanding the mechanism of mind-body interaction need not be seen as definitive refutation. The idea that causation necessarily depends on push-pull mechanisms (which would not be possible for a substance that did not occupy space) is also arguably based on obsolete conceptions of physics.\n\nThe problem of mental causation is also discussed in the context of other positions on the mind-body problem, such as property dualism and anomalous monism.\n\nA more recent related objection is the \"argument from physics\", which argues that a mental substance impacting the physical world would contradict principles of physics. In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, it would violate the law of conservation of energy. Two main responses to this have been to suggest the mind influences the distribution but not the quantity of energy in the brain and to deny that the brain is a causally closed system in which conservation of energy would apply.\n\nTaking the argument a step further, it has been argued that because physics fully accounts for the causes of all physical movements, there can be no place for the a non-physical mind to play a role. The principle, in slightly different iterations, has variously been called \"causal closure\", \"completeness of the physical\", \"physical closure\", and \"physical comprehensiveness\". This has been the foremost argument against interactionism in contemporary philosophy.\n\nSome philosophers have suggested the influence of the mind on the body could be reconciled with deterministic physical laws by proposing the mind's impacts instead take place at points of quantum indeterminacy. Karl Popper and John Eccles, as well as the physicist Henry Stapp, have theorized that such indeterminacy may apply at the macroscopic scale. (See quantum mind.) However, Max Tegmark has argued that classical and quantum calculations show that quantum decoherence effects do not play a role in brain activity. David Chalmers has noted (without necessarily endorsing) a second possibility within quantum mechanics, that consciousness' causal role is to collapse the wave function as per the Von Neumann-Wigner interpretation of quantum mechanics. He acknowledges this is at odds with the interpretations of quantum mechanics held by most physicists, but notes, \"There is some irony in the fact that philosophers reject interactionism on largely physical grounds (it is incompatible with physical theory), while physicists reject an interactionist interpretation of quantum mechanics on largely philosophical grounds (it is dualistic). Taken conjointly, these reasons carry little force...\".\n\nThere remains a literature in philosophy and science, albeit a much-contested one, that asserts evidence for emergence in various domains, which would undermine the principle of causal closure. (See emergentism.) Another option that has been suggested is that the interaction may involve dark energy, dark matter or some other currently unknown scientific process.\n\nAnother possible resolution is akin to parallelism—Eugene Mills holds that behavioral events are causally overdetermined, and can be explained by either physical or mental causes alone. An overdetermined event is fully accounted for by multiple causes at once. However, J. J. C. Smart and Paul Churchland have argued that if physical phenomena fully determine behavioral events, then by Occam's razor a non-physical mind is unnecessary. Andrew Melnyk argues that overdetermination would require an \"intolerable coincidence.\"\n\nWhile causal closure remains a key obstacle for interactionism, it is not relevant to all forms of dualism; epiphenomenalism and parallelism are unaffected as they do not posit that the mind affects the body.\n\nInteractionism can be distinguished from competing dualist theories of causation, including epiphenomenalism (which admits causation, but views causation as unidirectional rather than bidirectional), and parallelism (which denies causation, while seeking to explain the semblance of causation by other means such as pre-established harmony or occasionalism).\n\nIn \"The Conscious Mind\", David Chalmers argued that regardless of the mechanism by which the mental might impact the physical if interactionism were true, there was a deeper conceptual issue: the chosen mechanism could always be separated from its phenomenal component, leading to simply a new form of epiphenomenalism. Later, he suggested that while the causal component could be separated, interactionism was like \"type-F monism\" (Russellian monism, panpsychism, and panprotopsychism) in that it gave entities externally characterized by physical relationships the additional intrinsic feature of conscious properties.\n\n"}

She was named after a town Adwa in northern Ethiopia.\n\nThe \"Adua\"-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding . They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of .\n\nFor surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the \"Adua\" class had a range of at , submerged, they had a range of at .\n\nThe boats were armed with six internal torpedo tubes, four in the bow and two in the stern. They were also armed with one deck gun for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of machine guns.\n\n\"Adua\" was built at the CRDA shipyard, in Monfalcone. She was laid down on 1 February 1936, launched on 13 September of the same year, and commissioned on 14 November 1936. After intense 1937 spring training in the waters of the Dodecanese, Greece and Libya, \"Adua\" was assigned to the 23rd Squadron based at Naples. In 1939 she was transferred to Cagliari and became part of the 71st Squadron (VII Submarine Group).\n\nOn June 10, 1940 at the time of Italy's entrance into World War II, \"Adua\" was already at sea, south of Sardinia (between Cape Teulada and the island of La Galite) under command of Giuseppe Roselli Lorenzini. On June 13, she moved to an area between Ibiza and Mallorca and later to the Gulf of Lion fifteen miles east of Cape Creus. During night of June 17, 1940 \"Adua\" sighted a destroyer, but could not launch an attack. The following morning, she sighted a French convoy (five merchants and two escorts) on the Marseille - Toulon route. Not being able to approach because of the escort, she launched a single torpedo from 1,800 meters at a larger transport. However, there are no confirmations of any ships being damaged or sunk on this day at this time and this location.\n\nShortly thereafter, captain Luigi Riccardi assumed command of the submarine.\n\nFrom October 22, 1940 to March 12, 1941 \"Adua\" served as the training vessel at the Pola Submarine School. During this span she carried out 46 training missions. Carlo Todaro and Mario Resio served as her commanders during this time. In mid-March 1941 \"Adua\" was transferred back to Taranto, and she was again put under command of captain Luigi Riccardi.\n\nFrom March to May 1941 \"Adua\" was deployed in the Gulf of Taranto, and also off the coast of Greece, carrying out three unsuccessful missions:\n\n\nOn May 10, 1941 she was transferred to Leros.\n\nAt 01:30 on June 3, 1941 she intercepted a small motor barge carrying gasoline and 72 British troops on board, including 8 officers, attempting to reach Egyptian coast. \"Adua\" took officers prisoner, and escorted the vessel to Crete, where other soldiers were taken prisoners.\n\nOn June 4, 1941, she headed back to Taranto where the submarine underwent a three-month long maintenance at the Arsenal of Taranto.\n\nIn the middle of September \"Adua\" operated near Menorca returning to Cagliari on September 16.\n\nOn September 23, 1941 the submarine left Cagliari to set an ambush on the route of the British convoy to Malta (Operation Halberd) together with three other submarines. On September 26 \"Adua\" was near Cape Palos, north of Spanish city of Cartagena. The British convoy went undetected and reached Malta. The submarines, including \" Adua\" spotted and attacked British ships on their return. On September 30, 1941 at 3:50 \"Adua\" detected a group of eleven English destroyers, and attacked them with a four-torpedo salvo, but missed them and then moved north. Shortly after at 5:25, \"Adua\" sent a radio transmission to the Headquarters informing them of British convoy position. She was never heard from again.\n\nAfter the war, it was discovered that the submarine had been traced by two destroyers, and (perhaps it was the radio communication with the base that allowed British ships to locate her). After having detected \"Adua\" with ASDIC, they started depth charge attacks, and at 10:30 hit and sunk \"Adua\" with all hands in the position or .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5619097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5619097", "title": "Jay Keasling", "text": "Jay Keasling\n\nJay D. Keasling is a Professor of Chemical engineering and Bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley. He is also Associate Laboratory Director for Biosciences at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and chief executive officer of the Joint BioEnergy Institute. He is considered one of the foremost authorities in synthetic biology, especially in the field of metabolic engineering.\n\nKeasling received his bachelor's degree at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln where he was a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. He went on to complete his Doctor of Philosophy degree at the University of Michigan in 1991 under the supervision of Bernhard Palsson. Keasling performed post-doctoral research with Arthur Kornberg at Stanford University in 1991-1992.\n\nKeasling’s current research is focused on engineering chemistry inside microorganisms, an area known as metabolic engineering, for production of useful chemicals or for environmental cleanup. In much the same way that synthetic organic and industrial chemistry has allowed chemists and chemical engineers to produce from fossil fuel resources chemicals that we use every day, metabolic engineering can revolutionize the production of some of the same useful chemicals and more from renewable resources, like sugar and cellulosic biomass. For many years, work in metabolic engineering was limited by the lack of enzymes to perform the necessary chemistry and tools to manipulate and monitor the chemistry inside cells. Seeing a need for better genetic tools, Keasling began working on genetic tool development, an area now known as synthetic biology. Keasling’s laboratory has developed or adopted many of the latest analytical tools to troubleshoot our genetic manipulations. Keasling’s laboratory has applied metabolic chemistry to a number of real-world problems including the production of the antimalarial drug artemisinin and drop-in biofuels. Keasling has published over 300 papers in peer-reviewed journals and has over 30 issued patents.\n\nMalaria is a global health problem that threatens 300-500 million people and kills more than one million people annually. The chloroquine-based drugs that were used widely in the past have lost effectiveness because the Plasmodium parasite that causes malaria has become resistant to them. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide, extracted from \"Artemisia annua\" L is highly effective against Plasmodium spp. resistant to other anti-malarial drugs. However, there are several problems with current production methods for artemisinin. First, artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are too expensive for people in the developing world to afford. Second, artemisinin is extracted from \"A. annua\", and its yield and consistency depend on climate and the extraction process. While there is a method for chemical synthesis of artemisinin, it is too low yielding and therefore too expensive for use in producing low-cost drugs. Third, although the World Health Organization has recommended that artemisinin be formulated with other active pharmaceutical ingredients in ACTs, many manufacturers are still producing mono-therapies of artemisinin, which increase the chance that Plasmodium spp. will develop resistance to artemisinin.\n\nJay Keasling’s laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley has engineered both \"Escherichia coli\" and \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" to produce artemisinic acid, a precursor to artemisinin that can be derivatized using established, simple, inexpensive chemistry to form artemisinin or any artemisinin derivative currently used to treat malaria. The microorganisms were engineered with a ten-enzyme biosynthetic pathway using genes from ‘‘Artemisia annua’‘, \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", and \"Escherichia coli\" (twelve genes in all) to transform a simple and renewable sugar, like glucose, into the complicated chemical structure of the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. The engineered microorganism is capable of secreting the final product from the cell, thereby purifying it from all other intracellular chemicals and reducing the purification costs and therefore the cost of the final drug. Given the existence of known, relatively high-yielding chemistry for the conversion of artemisinic acid to artemisinin or any other artemisinin derivative, microbially-produced artemisinic acid is a viable, renewable, and scalable source of this potent family of anti-malarial drugs.\n\nA critical element of Keasling’s work was the development of genetic tools to aid in the manipulation of microbial metabolism, particularly for low-value products that require high yields from sugar. His laboratory developed single-copy plasmids for the expression of complex metabolic pathways, promoter systems that allow regulated control of transcription consistently in all cells of a culture, mRNA stabilization technologies to regulate the stability of mRNA segments, and a protein engineering approach to attach several enzymes of a metabolic pathway onto a synthetic protein scaffold to increase pathway flux. These and other gene expression tools now enable precise control of the expression of the genes that encode novel metabolic pathways to maximize chemical production, to minimize losses to side products, and minimize the accumulation of toxic intermediates that may poison the microbial host, all of which are important for economical production of this important drug.\n\nAnother critical aspect of Keasling’s work was discovering the chemistry and enzymes in \"Artemisia annua\" responsible for synthesis of artemisinin. These enzymes included the cytochrome P450 that oxidizes amorphadiene to artemisinic acid and the redox partners that transfer reducing equivalents from the enzyme to cofactors. The discovery of these enzymes and their functional expression in both yeast and \"E. coli\", along with the other nine enzymes in the metabolic pathway, allowed production of artemisinic acid by these two microorganisms. \"S. cerevisiae\" was chosen for the large-scale production process and was further engineered to improve artemisinic acid production.\n\nKeasling’s microbial production process has a number of advantages over extraction from plants. First, microbial synthesis will reduce the cost of artemisinin, the most expensive component of artemisinin-based combination therapies—by as much as tenfold—and therefore make artemisinin-derived anti-malarial drugs more affordable to people in the developing world. Second, weather conditions or political climates that might otherwise affect the yield or cost of the plant-derived version of the drug will not affect the microbial source for the drug. Third, microbial production of artemisinin in large tanks will allow for more careful distribution of artemisinin to legitimate drug manufacturers that formulate artemisinin combination therapies, rather than monotherapies. This will, in turn, slow the development of resistance to this drug. Fourth, severe shortages of plant-derived artemisinin are projected for 2011 and beyond, which will increase the cost of artemisinin combination therapies. Finally, microbially-derived artemisinic acid will enable production of new derivatives of artemisinin that Plasmodium may not be resistant to, thereby extending the time over which artemisinin may be used.\n\nTo ensure that the process he developed would benefit people in the developing world, Dr. Keasling assembled a unique team consisting of his laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley; Amyris Biotechnologies, a company founded on this technology; and the Institute for OneWorld Health, a non-profit pharmaceutical company located in San Francisco, CA. In addition to assembling the team, Dr. Keasling developed an intellectual property model to ensure that microbially-sourced artemisinin could be offered as inexpensively as possible to people in the developing world: patents granted from his work at UCB are licensed royalty free to Amyris Biotechnologies and the Institute for OneWorld Health for use in producing artemisinin so long as they do not make a profit on artemisinin sold in the developing world. The team was funded in December 2004 by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop the microbial production process. The science was completed in Dec. 2007. In 2008, Sanofi-Aventis licensed the technology and worked with Amyris to develop the production process. Sanofi-Aventis has produced 35 tons of artemisinin using Keasling’s microbial production process, which is enough for 70 million treatments. Distribution of artemisinin combination therapies containing the microbially-sourced artemisinin began in August 2014 with 1.7 million treatments shipped to Africa. It is anticipated that 100-150 million treatments will be produced using this technology and shipped annually to Africa, Asia, and South America.\n\nRenewable fuels are needed for all modes of transportation. Unfortunately, most microbially-sourced fuels can be used only as a small fraction of gasoline in conventional spark-ignition engines. Keasling’s laboratory has engineered microorganisms to produce hydrocarbons with similar properties to the fuels now derived from petroleum. These fuels are synthesized from plant-derived sugars, such as cellulose feedstock, which is of little economic value. Consequently, microbes can minimize the carbon footprint by minimizing the energy expenditure in sourcing fuel, such off-shore drilling and hydraulic fracturing to name a few.\n\nKeasling and his colleagues demonstrated that \"Escherichia coli\" and \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" can be engineered to produce the fatty acid-based biofuels fatty acid ethyl esters, alkenes, and methyl ketones. As linear hydrocarbons are the key components of diesel, these biologically produced fuels are excellent diesel replacements. However, fuels containing only long, linear, hydrocarbon chains will freeze under cold conditions. To develop fuels suitable for cold applications, Keasling’s laboratory engineered \"E. coli\" and \"S. cerevisiae\" to produce branched and cyclic hydrocarbons using the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway: isopentanol, a drop-in replacement for gasoline; pinene, a replacement for jet fuel; and bisabolene, a replacement for diesel fuel. Because isoprenoids add a methyl side chain every four carbons in the backbone, fuels made from isoprenoids have very low freeze and cloud points, making them suitable as cold-weather diesels and jet fuels.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in scaling up microbial fermentations is the stability of the microbial strain: the engineered microorganism will attempt to mutate or shed the metabolic pathway, in part because intermediates in the metabolic pathway accumulate and are toxic to the cells. To balance pathway flux and reduce the cost of producing a desired biofuel, Keasling’s laboratory developed dynamic regulators to sense the levels of intermediates in the pathway and regulate pathway activity. These regulators stabilized the pathway and the cell and improved biofuel yields making it possible to grow the engineered cells in large-scale fermentation tanks for fuel production.\n\nMany of the best fuels and chemicals are toxic to the producer organism. One way to limit fuel toxicity is to actively pump the fuel from the cell. To identify pumps ideally suited for a particular fuel, Keasling and his colleagues bioprospected environmental microorganisms for many, different, three-component transporters and selected for the pumps most effective for a particular fuel. These transporters allowed \"E. coli\" to grow in the presence of the fuels and, as a result, produce more of the target fuel than it would have been able to do so in the absence of the transporter.\n\nThe starting materials (generally sugars) are the most significant factor in the biofuel production cost. Cellulose, a potentially low-cost starting material, must be depolymerized into sugars by adding an expensive cocktail of enzymes. One way to reduce this cost is to engineer the fuel-producing microbe to also produce the enzymes to depolymerize cellulose and hemicellulose. Recently, Keasling’s laboratory demonstrated that a microorganism could be engineered to synthesize and secrete enzymes to depolymerize cellulose and hemicellulose into sugars and to produce a gasoline replacement (butanol), a diesel-fuel replacement (fatty acid ethyl ester), or a jet fuel replacement (pinene).\n\nAs a technological platform, biofuel manufacturing faces huge economic hurdles many of which depend on the market pricing of crude oil and other conventionally sourced fuels. Nonetheless, metabolic engineering is a technology that is becoming increasingly competitive and is expected to have wide-reaching effects by 2020.\n\n\nKeasling is a founder of Amyris (with Vincent Martin, Jack Newman, Neil Renninger, and Kinkead Reiling), LS9 (now part of REG with George Church and Chris Sommerville), and Lygos (with Leonard Katz, Clem Fortman, Jeffrey Dietrich, and Eric Steen).\n\nKeasling is originally from Harvard, Nebraska, and is openly gay.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16864", "title": "Karma", "text": "Karma\n\nKarma (; , ; ) means action, work or deed; it also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect). Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and future suffering. \n\nThe philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth in many schools of Indian religions (particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism) as well as Taoism. In these schools, karma in the present affects one's future in the current life, as well as the nature and quality of future lives - one's \"saṃsāra\".\n\"Karma\" is the executed \"deed\", \"work\", \"action\", or \"act\", and it is also the \"object\", the \"intent\". Wilhelm Halbfass explains karma (karman) by contrasting it with another Sanskrit word \"kriya\". The word \"kriya\" is the activity along with the steps and effort in action, while \"karma\" is (1) the executed action as a consequence of that activity, as well as (2) the intention of the actor behind an executed action or a planned action (described by some scholars as metaphysical residue left in the actor). A good action creates good karma, as does good intent. A bad action creates bad karma, as does bad intent.\n\nKarma, also refers to a conceptual principle that originated in India, often descriptively called the principle of karma, sometimes as the karma theory or the law of karma. In the context of theory, karma is complex and difficult to define. Different schools of Indologists derive different definitions for the karma concept from ancient Indian texts; their definition is some combination of (1) causality that may be ethical or non-ethical; (2) ethicization, that is good or bad actions have consequences; and (3) rebirth. Other Indologists include in the definition of karma theory that which explains the present circumstances of an individual with reference to his or her actions in past. These actions may be those in a person's current life, or, in some schools of Indian traditions, possibly actions in their past lives; furthermore, the consequences may result in current life, or a person's future lives. The law of karma operates independent of any deity or any process of divine judgment.\n\nDifficulty in arriving at a definition of \"karma\" arises because of the diversity of views among the schools of Hinduism; some, for example, consider karma and rebirth linked and simultaneously essential, some consider karma but not rebirth essential, and a few discuss and conclude karma and rebirth to be flawed fiction. Buddhism and Jainism have their own karma precepts. Thus karma has not one, but multiple definitions and different meanings. It is a concept whose meaning, importance and scope varies between Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and other traditions that originated in India, and various schools in each of these traditions. O'Flaherty claims that, furthermore, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether karma is a theory, a model, a paradigm, a metaphor, or a metaphysical stance.\n\nKarma theory as a concept, across different Indian religious traditions, shares certain common themes: causality, ethicization and rebirth.\n\nA common theme to theories of karma is its principle of causality. One of the earliest association of karma to causality occurs in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad of Hinduism. For example, at 4.4.5-6, it states:\n\nThe relationship of karma to causality is a central motif in all schools of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist thought. The theory of karma as causality holds that (1) executed actions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives, and (2) the intentions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives. Disinterested actions, or unintentional actions do not have the same positive or negative karmic effect, as interested and intentional actions. In Buddhism, for example, actions that are performed, or arise, or originate without any bad intent such as covetousness, are considered non-existent in karmic impact or neutral in influence to the individual.\n\nAnother causality characteristic, shared by Karmic theories, is that like deeds lead to like effects. Thus good karma produces good effect on the actor, while bad karma produces bad effect. This effect may be material, moral or emotional — that is, one's karma affects one's happiness and unhappiness. The effect of karma need not be immediate; the effect of karma can be later in one's current life, and in some schools it extends to future lives.\n\nThe consequence or effects of one's karma can be described in two forms: \"phalas\" and \"samskaras\". A \"phala\" (literally, fruit or result) is the visible or invisible effect that is typically immediate or within the current life. In contrast, \"samskaras\" are invisible effects, produced inside the actor because of the karma, transforming the agent and affecting his or her ability to be happy or unhappy in this life and future ones. The theory of karma is often presented in the context of \"samskaras\".\n\nKarmic principle can be understood, suggests Karl Potter, as a principle of psychology and habit. Karma seeds habits (vāsanā), and habits create the nature of man. Karma also seeds self perception, and perception influences how one experiences life events. Both habits and self perception affect the course of one's life. Breaking bad habits is not easy: it requires conscious karmic effort. Thus psyche and habit, according to Potter and others, link karma to causality in ancient Indian literature. The idea of karma may be compared to the notion of a person's \"character\", as both are an assessment of the person and determined by that person's habitual thinking and acting.\n\nThe second theme common to karma theories is ethicization. This begins with the premise that every action has a consequence, which will come to fruition in either this or a future life; thus, morally good acts will have positive consequences, whereas bad acts will produce negative results. An individual's present situation is thereby explained by reference to actions in his present or in previous lifetimes. Karma is not itself \"reward and punishment\", but the law that produces consequence. Halbfass notes, good karma is considered as \"dharma\" and leads to \"punya\" (merit), while bad karma is considered \"adharma\" and leads to \"pāp\" (demerit, sin).\n\nReichenbach suggests that the theories of karma are an ethical theory. This is so because the ancient scholars of India linked intent and actual action to the merit, reward, demerit and punishment. A theory without ethical premise would be a pure causal relation; the merit or reward or demerit or punishment would be same regardless of the actor's intent. In ethics, one's intentions, attitudes and desires matter in the evaluation of one's action. Where the outcome is unintended, the moral responsibility for it is less on the actor, even though causal responsibility may be the same regardless. A karma theory considers not only the action, but also actor's intentions, attitude, and desires before and during the action. The karma concept thus encourages each person to seek and live a moral life, as well as avoid an immoral life. The meaning and significance of karma is thus as a building block of an ethical theory.\n\nThe third common theme of karma theories is the concept of reincarnation or the cycle of rebirths (\"saṃsāra\"). Rebirth is a fundamental concept of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. The concept has been intensely debated in ancient literature of India; with different schools of Indian religions considering the relevance of rebirth as either essential, or secondary, or unnecessary fiction. Karma is a basic concept, rebirth is a derivative concept, so suggests Creel; Karma is a fact, asserts Yamunacharya, while reincarnation is a hypothesis; in contrast, Hiriyanna suggests rebirth is a necessary corollary of karma.\n\nRebirth, or \"saṃsāra\", is the concept that all life forms go through a cycle of reincarnation, that is a series of births and rebirths. The rebirths and consequent life may be in different realm, condition or form. The karma theories suggest that the realm, condition and form depends on the quality and quantity of karma. In schools that believe in rebirth, every living being's soul transmigrates (recycles) after death, carrying the seeds of Karmic impulses from life just completed, into another life and lifetime of karmas. This cycle continues indefinitely, except for those who consciously break this cycle by reaching \"moksa\". Those who break the cycle reach the realm of gods, those who don't continue in the cycle.\n\nThe theory of \"karma and rebirth\" raises numerous questions—such as how, when, and why did the cycle start in the first place, what is the relative Karmic merit of one karma versus another and why, and what evidence is there that rebirth actually happens, among others. Various schools of Hinduism realized these difficulties, debated their own formulations, some reaching what they considered as internally consistent theories, while other schools modified and de-emphasized it, while a few schools in Hinduism such as Charvakas, Lokayatana abandoned \"karma and rebirth\" theory altogether. Schools of Buddhism consider karma-rebirth cycle as integral to their theories of soteriology.\n\nThe Vedic Sanskrit word (nominative ') means \"work\" or \"deed\", often used in the context of Srauta rituals.\nIn the Rigveda, the word occurs some 40 times. In Satapatha Brahmana 1.7.1.5, sacrifice is declared as the \"greatest\" of \"works\"; Satapatha Brahmana 10.1.4.1 associates the potential of becoming immortal (\"amara\") with the \"karma\" of the agnicayana sacrifice.\n\nThe earliest clear discussion of the karma doctrine is in the Upanishads. For example, the causality and ethicization is stated in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.2.13 (\"Truly, one becomes good through good \"deeds\", and evil through evil \"deeds\".\")\n\nSome authors state that the \"samsara\" (transmigration) and karma doctrine may be non-Vedic, and the ideas may have developed in the \"shramana\" traditions that preceded Buddhism and Jainism. Others state that some of the complex ideas of the ancient emerging theory of karma flowed from Vedic thinkers to Buddhist and Jain thinkers. The mutual influences between the traditions is unclear, and likely co-developed.\n\nMany philosophical debates surrounding the concept are shared by the Hindu, Jain and Buddhist traditions, and the early developments in each tradition incorporated different novel ideas. For example, Buddhists allowed karma transfer from one person to another and sraddha rites, but had difficulty defending the rationale. In contrast, Hindu schools and Jainism would not allow the possibility of karma transfer.\n\nThe concept of karma in Hinduism developed and evolved over centuries. The earliest Upanishads began with the questions about how and why man is born, and what happens after death. As answers to the latter, the early theories in these ancient Sanskrit documents include \"pancagni vidya\" (the five fire doctrine), \"pitryana\" (the cyclic path of fathers) and \"devayana\" (the cycle-transcending, path of the gods). Those who do superficial rituals and seek material gain, claimed these ancient scholars, travel the way of their fathers and recycle back into another life; those who renounce these, go into the forest and pursue spiritual knowledge, were claimed to climb into the higher path of the gods. It is these who break the cycle and are not reborn. With the composition of the Epics - the common man's introduction to Dharma in Hinduism - the ideas of causality and essential elements of the theory of karma were being recited in folk stories. For example:\nIn the thirteenth book of the Mahabharata, also called the Teaching Book (Anushasana Parva), sixth chapter opens with Yudhishthira asking Bhishma: \"Is the course of a person's life already destined, or can human effort shape one's life?\" The future, replies Bhishma, is both a function of current human effort derived from free will and past human actions that set the circumstances. Over and over again, the chapters of Mahabharata recite the key postulates of karma theory. That is: intent and action (karma) has consequences; karma lingers and doesn't disappear; and, all positive or negative experiences in life require effort and intent. For example:\nOver time, various schools of Hinduism developed many different definitions of karma, some making karma appear quite deterministic, while others make room for free will and moral agency. Among the six most studied schools of Hinduism, the theory of karma evolved in different ways, as their respective scholars reasoned and attempted to address the internal inconsistencies, implications and issues of the karma doctrine. According to Halbfass,\n\nThe above six schools illustrate the diversity of views, but are not exhaustive. Each school has sub-schools in Hinduism, such as Vedanta school's nondualism and dualism sub-schools. Furthermore, there are other schools of Hinduism such as Charvaka, Lokayata (the materialists) who denied the theory of karma-rebirth as well as the existence of God; to this school of Hindus, the properties of things come from the nature of things. Causality emerges from the interaction, actions and nature of things and people, determinative principles such as karma or God are unnecessary.\n\n\"Karma\" and \"karmaphala\" are fundamental concepts in Buddhism. The concepts of \"karma\" and \"karmaphala\" explain how our intentional actions keep us tied to rebirth in \"samsara\", whereas the Buddhist path, as exemplified in the Noble Eightfold Path, shows us the way out of \"samsara\". \"Karmaphala\" is the \"fruit\", \"effect\" or \"result\" of \"karma\". A similar term is \"karmavipaka\", the \"maturation\" or \"cooking\" of \"karma\". The cycle of rebirth is determined by \"karma\", literally \"action\". In the Buddhist tradition, \"karma\" refers to actions driven by \"intention\" (\"cetanā\"), a deed done deliberately through body, speech or mind, which leads to future consequences. The \"Nibbedhika Sutta\", Anguttara Nikaya 6.63:\n\nHow these intentional actions lead to rebirth, and how the idea of rebirth is to be reconciled with the doctrines of impermanence and no-self, is a matter of philosophical inquiry in the Buddhist traditions, for which several solutions have been proposed. In early Buddhism no explicit theory of rebirth and karma is worked out, and \"the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology.\" In early Buddhism, rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance.\nThe Buddha's teaching of karma is not strictly deterministic, but incorporated circumstantial factors, unlike that of the Jains. It is not a rigid and mechanical process, but a flexible, fluid and dynamic process. There is no set linear relationship between a particular action and its results. The karmic effect of a deed is not determined solely by the deed itself, but also by the nature of the person who commits the deed, and by the circumstances in which it is committed. \"Karmaphala\" is not a \"judgement\" enforced by a God, Deity or other supernatural being that controls the affairs of the Cosmos. Rather, \"karmaphala\" is the outcome of a natural process of cause and effect.\nWithin Buddhism, the real importance of the doctrine of karma and its fruits lies in the recognition of the urgency to put a stop to the whole process. The \"Acintita Sutta\" warns that \"the results of kamma\" is one of the four incomprehensible subjects, subjects that are beyond all conceptualization and cannot be understood with logical thought or reason.\nNichiren Buddhism teaches that transformation and change through faith and practice changes adverse karma—negative causes made in the past that result in negative results in the present and future—to positive causes for benefits in the future. \n\nIn Jainism, \"karma\" conveys a totally different meaning from that commonly understood in Hindu philosophy and western civilization. Jain philosophy is the oldest Indian philosophy that completely separates body (matter) from the soul (pure consciousness). In Jainism, karma is referred to as karmic dirt, as it consists of very subtle particles of matter that pervade the entire universe. \"Karmas\" are attracted to the karmic field of a soul due to vibrations created by activities of mind, speech, and body as well as various mental dispositions. Hence the \"karmas\" are the subtle matter surrounding the consciousness of a soul. When these two components (consciousness and karma) interact, we experience the life we know at present.\nJain texts expound that seven \"tattvas\" (truths or fundamentals) constitute reality. These are:\n\nAccording to Padmanabh Jaini,This emphasis on reaping the fruits only of one's own karma was not restricted to the Jainas; both Hindus and Buddhist writers have produced doctrinal materials stressing the same point. Each of the latter traditions, however, developed practices in basic contradiction to such belief. In addition to \"shrardha\" (the ritual Hindu offerings by the son of deceased), we find among Hindus widespread adherence to the notion of divine intervention in ones fate, while Buddhists eventually came to propound such theories like boon-granting bodhisattvas, transfer of merit and like. Only Jainas have been absolutely unwilling to allow such ideas to penetrate their community, despite the fact that there must have been tremendous amount of social pressure on them to do so.\nThe key points where the theory of karma in Jainism can be stated as follows:\n\nIn Sikhism, all living beings are described as being under the influence of \"maya's\" three qualities. Always present together in varying mix and degrees, these three qualities of \"maya\" bind the soul to the body and to the earth plane. Above these three qualities is the eternal time. Due to the influence of three modes of Maya's nature, \"jivas\" (individual beings) perform activities under the control and purview of the eternal time. These activities are called \"karma\". The underlying principle is that karma is the law that brings back the results of actions to the person performing them.\n\nThis life is likened to a field in which our karma is the seed. We harvest exactly what we sow; no less, no more. This infallible law of karma holds everyone responsible for what the person is or is going to be. Based on the total sum of past karma, some feel close to the Pure Being in this life and others feel separated. This is the Gurbani's (Sri Guru Granth Sahib) law of karma. Like other Indian and oriental schools of thought, the Gurbani also accepts the doctrines of karma and reincarnation as the facts of nature.\n\nInterpreted as \"Musubi\", a view of karma is recognized in Shintoism as a means of enriching, empowering and life affirming.\n\nKarma is an important concept in Taoism. Every deed is tracked by deities and spirits. Appropriate rewards or retribution follow karma, just like a shadow follows a person.\n\nThe karma doctrine of Taoism developed in three stages. In the first stage, causality between actions and consequences was adopted, with supernatural beings keeping track of everyone's karma and assigning fate (\"ming\"). In the second phase, transferability of karma ideas from Chinese Buddhism were expanded, and a transfer or inheritance of Karmic fate from ancestors to one's current life was introduced. In the third stage of karma doctrine development, ideas of rebirth based on karma were added. One could be reborn either as another human being or another animal, according to this belief. In the third stage, additional ideas were introduced; for example, rituals, repentance and offerings at Taoist temples were encouraged as it could alleviate Karmic burden.\n\nOwnby (2008) claims that Falun Gong differs from Buddhism in its definition of the term \"karma\" in that it is taken not as a process of award and punishment, but as an exclusively negative term. The Chinese term \"de\" or \"virtue\" is reserved for what might otherwise be termed \"good karma\" in Buddhism. Karma is understood as the source of all suffering - what Buddhism might refer to as \"bad karma\". Li says, \"A person has done bad things over his many lifetimes, and for people this results in misfortune, or for cultivators it's karmic obstacles, so there's birth, aging, sickness, and death. This is ordinary karma.\"\n\nFalun Gong teaches that the spirit is locked in the cycle of rebirth, also known as samsara due to the accumulation of karma. This is a negative, black substance that accumulates in other dimensions lifetime after lifetime, by doing bad deeds and thinking bad thoughts. Falun Gong states that karma is the reason for suffering, and what ultimately blocks people from the truth of the universe and attaining enlightenment. At the same time, karma is also the cause of one's continued rebirth and suffering. Li says that due to accumulation of karma the human spirit upon death will reincarnate over and over again, until the karma is paid off or eliminated through cultivation, or the person is destroyed due to the bad deeds he has done.\n\nOwnby regards the concept of karma as a cornerstone to individual moral behaviour in Falun Gong, and also readily traceable to the Christian doctrine of \"one reaps what one sows\". Others say Matthew 5:44 means no unbeliever will not fully reap what they sow until they are Judged by God after death in Hell. Ownby says Falun Gong is differentiated by a \"system of transmigration\", though, \"in which each organism is the reincarnation of a previous life form, its current form having been determined by karmic calculation of the moral qualities of the previous lives lived.\" Ownby says the seeming unfairness of manifest inequities can then be explained, at the same time allowing a space for moral behaviour in spite of them. In the same vein of Li's monism, matter and spirit are one, karma is identified as a black substance which must be purged in the process of cultivation.\n\nLi says that \"Human beings all fell here from the many dimensions of the universe. They no longer met the requirements of the Fa at their given levels in the universe, and thus had to drop down. Just as we have said before, the heavier one's mortal attachments, the further down one drops, with the descent continuing until one arrives at the state of ordinary human beings.\" He says that in the eyes of higher beings, the purpose of human life is not merely to be human, but to awaken quickly on Earth, a \"setting of delusion\", and return. \"That is what they really have in mind; they are opening a door for you. Those who fail to return will have no choice but to reincarnate, with this continuing until they amass a huge amount of karma and are destroyed.\"\n\nOwnby regards this as the basis for Falun Gong's apparent \"opposition to practitioners' taking medicine when ill; they are missing an opportunity to work off karma by allowing an illness to run its course (suffering depletes karma) or to fight the illness through cultivation.\" Benjamin Penny shares this interpretation. Since Li believes that \"karma is the primary factor that causes sickness in people\", Penny asks: \"if disease comes from karma and karma can be eradicated through cultivation of \"xinxing\", then what good will medicine do?\" Li himself states that he is not forbidding practitioners from taking medicine, maintaining that \"What I'm doing is telling people the relationship between practicing cultivation and medicine-taking\". Li also states that \"An everyday person needs to take medicine when he gets sick.\" Schechter quotes a Falun Gong student who says \"It is always an individual choice whether one should take medicine or not.\"\n\nOne of the significant controversies with the karma doctrine is whether it always implies destiny, and its implications on free will. This controversy is also referred to as the moral agency problem; the controversy is not unique to karma doctrine, but also found in some form in monotheistic religions.\n\nThe free will controversy can be outlined in three parts: (1) A person who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, can claim all his bad actions were a product of his karma: he is devoid of free will, he can not make a choice, he is an agent of karma, and he merely delivers necessary punishments his \"wicked\" victims deserved for their own karma in past lives. Are crimes and unjust actions due to free will, or because of forces of karma? (2) Does a person who suffers from the unnatural death of a loved one, or rape or any other unjust act, assume a moral agent is responsible, that the harm is gratuitous, and therefore seek justice? Or, should one blame oneself for bad karma over past lives, and assume that the unjust suffering is fate? (3) Does the karma doctrine undermine the incentive for moral education--because all suffering is deserved and consequence of past lives, why learn anything when the balance sheet of karma from past lives will determine one's action and sufferings?\n\nThe explanations and replies to the above free will problem vary by the specific school of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The schools of Hinduism, such as Yoga and Advaita Vedanta, that have emphasized current life over the dynamics of karma residue moving across past lives, allow free will. Their argument, as well of other schools, are threefold: (1) The theory of karma includes both the action and the intent behind that action. Not only is one affected by past karma, one creates new karma whenever one acts with intent - good or bad. If intent and act can be proven beyond reasonable doubt, new karma can be proven, and the process of justice can proceed against this new karma. The actor who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, must be considered as the moral agent for this new karma, and tried. (2) Life forms not only receive and reap the consequence of their past karma, together they are the means to initiate, evaluate, judge, give and deliver consequence of karma to others. (3) Karma is a theory that explains some evils, not all (see moral evil versus natural evil).\n\nOther schools of Hinduism, as well as Buddhism and Jainism that do consider cycle of rebirths central to their beliefs and that karma from past lives affects one's present, believe that both free will (\"Cetanā\") and karma can co-exist; however, their answers have not persuaded all scholars.\n\nAnother issue with the theory of karma is that it is psychologically indeterminate, suggests Obeyesekere. That is, (1) if no one can know what their karma was in previous lives, and (2) if the karma from past lives can determine one's future, then the individual is psychologically unclear what if anything he or she can do now to shape the future, be more happy, or reduce suffering. If something goes wrong such as sickness or failure at work the individual is unclear if karma from past lives was the cause, or the sickness was caused by curable infection and the failure was caused by something correctable.\n\nThis psychological indeterminacy problem is also not unique to the theory of karma; it is found in every religion adopting the premise that God has a plan, or in some way influences human events. As with the karma-and-free-will problem above, schools that insist on primacy of rebirths face the most controversy. Their answers to the psychological indeterminacy issue are the same as those for addressing the free will problem.\n\nSome schools of Asian religions, particularly Popular Theravada Buddhism, allow transfer of karma merit and demerit from one person to another. This transfer is an exchange of non-physical quality just like an exchange of physical goods between two human beings. The practice of karma transfer, or even its possibility, is controversial. Karma transfer raises questions similar to those with substitutionary atonement and vicarious punishment. It defeats the ethical foundations, and dissociates the causality and ethicization in the theory of karma from the moral agent. Proponents of some Buddhist schools suggest that the concept of karma merit transfer encourages religious giving, and such transfers are not a mechanism to transfer bad karma (i.e., demerit) from one person to another.\n\nIn Hinduism, Sraddha rites during funerals have been labelled as karma merit transfer ceremonies by a few scholars, a claim disputed by others. Other schools in Hinduism, such as the Yoga and Advaita Vedantic philosophies, and Jainism hold that karma can not be transferred.\n\nThere has been an ongoing debate about karma theory and how it answers the problem of evil and related problem of theodicy. The problem of evil is a significant question debated in monotheistic religions with two beliefs: (1) There is one God who is absolutely good and compassionate (omnibenevolent), and (2) That one God knows absolutely everything (omniscient) and is all powerful (omnipotent). The problem of evil is then stated in formulations such as, \"why does the omnibenevolent, omniscient and omnipotent God allow any evil and suffering to exist in the world?\" Max Weber extended the problem of evil to Eastern traditions.\n\nThe problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Eastern traditions, both in theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in Uttara Mīmāṃsā Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1; the 8th century arguments by Adi Sankara in \"Brahmasutrabhasya\" where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world; and the 11th century theodicy discussion by Ramanuja in \"Sribhasya\". Epics such as the Mahabharata, for example, suggests three prevailing theories in ancient India as to why good and evil exists one being that everything is ordained by God, another being karma, and a third citing chance events (\"yadrccha\", यदृच्छा). The Mahabharata, which includes Hindu deity Vishnu in the form of Krishna as one of the central characters in the Epic, debates the nature and existence of suffering from these three perspectives, and includes a theory of suffering as arising from an interplay of chance events (such as floods and other events of nature), circumstances created by past human actions, and the current desires, volitions, dharma, adharma and current actions (\"purusakara\") of people. However, while karma theory in the Mahabharata presents alternative perspectives on the problem of evil and suffering, it offers no conclusive answer.\n\nOther scholars suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some theistic schools do not define or characterize their God(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato’s Demiurge. Therefore, the problem of theodicy in many schools of major Indian religions is not significant, or at least is of a different nature than in Western religions. Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus. Some scholars, particularly of the Nyaya school of Hinduism and Sankara in \"Brahmasutra bhasya\", have posited that karma doctrine implies existence of god, who administers and affects the person's environment given that person's karma, but then acknowledge that it makes karma as violable, contingent and unable to address the problem of evil. Arthur Herman states that karma-transmigration theory solves all three historical formulations to the problem of evil while acknowledging the theodicy insights of Sankara and Ramanuja.\n\nSome theistic Indian religions, such as Sikhism, suggest evil and suffering are a human phenomenon and arises from the karma of individuals. In other theistic schools such as those in Hinduism, particularly its Nyaya school, karma is combined with dharma and evil is explained as arising from human actions and intent that is in conflict with dharma. In nontheistic religions such as Buddhism, Jainism and the Mimamsa school of Hinduism, karma theory is used to explain the cause of evil as well as to offer distinct ways to avoid or be unaffected by evil in the world.\n\nThose schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism that rely on karma-rebirth theory have been critiqued for their theological explanation of suffering in children by birth, as the result of his or her sins in a past life. Others disagree, and consider the critique as flawed and a misunderstanding of the karma theory.\n\nWestern culture, influenced by Christianity, holds a notion similar to karma, as demonstrated in the phrase \"what goes around comes around\".\n\nMary Jo Meadow suggests karma is akin to \"Christian notions of sin and its effects.\" She states that the Christian teaching on a Last Judgment according to one's charity is a teaching on karma. Christianity also teaches morals such as one reaps what one sows (Galatians 6:7) and live by the sword, die by the sword (Matthew 26:52). Most scholars, however, consider the concept of Last Judgment as different from karma, with karma as an ongoing process that occurs every day in one's life, while Last Judgment, by contrast, is a one-time review at the end of life.\n\nThere is a concept in Judaism called in Hebrew \"midah k'neged midah\", which literally translates to \"value against value,\" but carries the same connotation as the English phrase \"measure for measure.\" The concept is used not so much in matters of law, but rather, in matters of ethics, i.e. how one's actions effects the world will eventually come back to that person in ways one might not necessarily expect. David Wolpe compared \"midah k'neged midah\" to karma.\n\nJung once opined on unresolved emotions and the synchronicity of karma;\nPopular methods for negating cognitive dissonance include meditation, metacognition, counselling, psychoanalysis, etc., whose aim is to enhance emotional self-awareness and thus avoid negative karma. This results in better emotional hygiene and reduced karmic impacts. Permanent neuronal changes within the amygdala and left prefrontal cortex of the human brain attributed to long-term meditation and metacognition techniques have been proven scientifically. This process of emotional maturation aspires to a goal of Individuation or self-actualisation. Such peak experiences are hypothetically devoid of any karma (nirvana or moksha).\n\nThe idea of karma was popularized in the Western world through the work of the Theosophical Society. In this conception, karma was a precursor to the Neopagan \"law of return\" or \"Threefold Law,\" the idea that the beneficial or harmful effects one has on the world will return to oneself. Colloquially this may be summed up as 'what goes around comes around.'\n\nThe Theosophist I. K. Taimni wrote, \"Karma is nothing but the Law of Cause and Effect operating in the realm of human life and bringing about adjustments between an individual and other individuals whom he has affected by his thoughts, emotions and actions.\" Theosophy also teaches that when humans reincarnate they come back as humans only, not as animals or other organisms.\n"}
{"id": "1301827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1301827", "title": "Last universal common ancestor", "text": "Last universal common ancestor\n\nThe last universal common ancestor (LUCA), also called the last universal ancestor (LUA), cenancestor, or (incorrectly) progenote, is the most recent population of organisms from which all organisms now living on Earth have a common descent. LUCA is the most recent common ancestor of all current life on Earth. LUCA is not thought to be the first living organism on Earth, but only one of many early organisms, whereas the others became extinct. \n\nWhile there is no specific fossil evidence of LUCA, it can be studied by comparing the genomes of its descendants, all organisms living today. By this means, a 2016 study identified a set of 355 genes inferred to have been present in LUCA. This would imply it was already a complex life form with many co-adapted features, including transcription and translation mechanisms to convert information between DNA, RNA, and proteins. However, some of those genes could have developed later and spread universally by horizontal gene transfer between archaea and bacteria.\n\nLUCA is estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago in the Paleoarchean era, a few hundred million years after the earliest evidence of life on Earth, for which there are several candidates. Microbial mat fossils have been found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone from Western Australia, while biogenic graphite has been found in 3.7 billion-year-old metamorphized sedimentary rocks from Western Greenland. Recent studies have tentatively proposed evidence of life as early as 4.28 billion years ago.\n\nCharles Darwin proposed the theory of universal common descent through an evolutionary process in his book \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859, saying, \"Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.\" Later biologists have separated the problem of the origin of life from that of the LUCA.\n\nBy analysis of the presumed LUCA's offspring groups, the LUCA appears to have been a small, single-celled organism. It likely had a ring-shaped coil of DNA floating freely within the cell, like modern bacteria. Morphologically, it would likely not have stood out within a mixed population of small modern-day bacteria. However, Carl Woese \"et al.\", who first proposed the currently-used three domain system based on an analysis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, stated that in its genetic machinery, the LUCA would have been a \"...simpler, more rudimentary entity than the individual ancestors that spawned the three [domains] (and their descendants)\".\n\nWhile the gross anatomy of LUCA can only be reconstructed with much uncertainty, its biochemical mechanisms can be described in some detail, based on the properties currently shared by all independently living organisms on Earth.\n\nThe genetic code was most likely based on DNA, though some studies suggest that LUCA may have been defined wholly through RNA. If DNA was present, it was composed exclusively of four nucleotides: deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, deoxythymidine, and deoxyguanosine. The DNA was kept double-stranded by a template-dependent enzyme, DNA polymerase. The integrity of the DNA benefited from a group of maintenance and repair enzymes including DNA topoisomerase and DNA ligase. The DNA was also protected by DNA-binding proteins such as histones. The genetic code was composed of 64 three-nucleotide codons which redundantly coded for 20 amino acids.\nIf the code was DNA-based, its genetic code was expressed via single-stranded RNA intermediates. The RNA was produced by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase using nucleotides similar to those of DNA, with the exception that the DNA nucleotide thymidine was replaced by uridine in RNA.\n\nThe genetic code was expressed into proteins. These were assembled from free amino acids by translation of a messenger RNA via a mechanism of ribosomes, transfer RNAs, and a group of related proteins. The ribosomes were composed of two subunits, a big 50S and a small 30S. Each ribosomal subunit was composed of a core of ribosomal RNA surrounded by ribosomal proteins. Both types of RNA molecules (ribosomal and transfer RNAs) played an important role in the catalytic activity of the ribosomes. Only 20 amino acids were used, only in L-isomers, to the exclusion of countless other amino acids. ATP served as an energy intermediate. Several hundred protein enzymes catalyzed chemical reactions to extract energy from fats, sugars, and amino acids, and to synthesize fats, sugars, amino acids, and nucleic acid bases through various chemical pathways.\n\nThe cell contained a water-based cytoplasm effectively enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane. The cell tended to exclude sodium and concentrate potassium by means of specific ion transporters (or ion pumps). The cell multiplied by duplicating all its contents followed by cellular division.\nThe cell used chemiosmosis to produce energy. It also reduced CO and oxidized H (methanogenesis or acetogenesis) via acetyl-thioesters.\n\nThe LUCA probably lived in the high-temperature conditions found in deep sea vents caused by ocean water interacting with magma beneath the ocean floor.\n\nIn 1859, Charles Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species\" in which he twice stated the hypothesis that there was only one progenitor for all life forms. In the summation he states, \"Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.\" The very last sentence begins with a restatement of the hypothesis: \"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one...\"\n\nWhen the LUCA was hypothesized, cladograms based on genetic distance between living cells indicated that Archaea split early from the rest of life. This was inferred from the fact that the archaeans known at that time were highly resistant to environmental extremes such as high salinity, temperature or acidity, leading some scientists to suggest that the LUCA evolved in areas like the deep ocean vents, where such extremes prevail today. Archaea, however, were later discovered in less hostile environments, and are now believed to be more closely related to the Eukaryota than to the Bacteria, although many details are still unknown.\n\nIn 2010, based on \"the vast array of molecular sequences now available from all domains of life,\" a formal test of universal common ancestry was published. The formal test favored the existence of a universal common ancestor over a wide class of alternative hypotheses that included horizontal gene transfer. Basic biochemical principles make it overwhelmingly likely that all organisms do have a single common ancestor. It is extremely unlikely that organisms descended from separate incidents of cell-formation would be able to complete a horizontal gene transfer without garbling each other's genes, converting them into noncoding segments. Further, many more amino acids are chemically possible than the twenty found in modern protein molecules. These lines of chemical evidence, incorporated into the formal statistical test point to a single cell having been the LUCA. While the test overwhelmingly favored the existence of a single LUCA, this does not imply that the LUCA was ever alone: instead, it was one of many early microbes but the only one whose descendents survived beyond the Paleoarchean Era. \n\nWith the later gene pool of the LUCA's descendants, with their common framework of the AT/GC rule and the standard twenty amino acids, horizontal gene transfer would have been feasible and could have been very common.\n\nIn an earlier hypothesis, Carl Woese (1988) had proposed that: (1) no individual organism can be considered a LUCA, and (2) the genetic heritage of all modern organisms derived through horizontal gene transfer among an ancient community of organisms. While the results described by Theobald (2010) and Saey (2010) demonstrate the existence of a single LUCA, Woese's argument can still be applied to Ur-organisms (initial products of abiogenesis) before the LUCA. At the beginnings of life, ancestry was not as linear as it is today because the genetic code had not evolved. Before high fidelity replication, organisms could not be easily mapped on a phylogenetic tree. However, the LUCA lived after the origin of the genetic code and at least some rudimentary early form of molecular proofreading.\n\nThe most commonly accepted tree of life, based on several molecular studies, has its root between a monophyletic domain Bacteria and a clade formed by Archaea and Eukaryota. However, a very small minority of studies place the root in the domain Bacteria, either in the phylum Firmicutes or state that the phylum Chloroflexi is basal to a clade with Archaea and Eukaryotes and the rest of Bacteria (as proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith).\n\nGround-breaking research by William F. Martin (2016) genetically analyzed 6.1 million protein-coding genes and 286,514 protein clusters from sequenced prokaryotic genomes of various phylogenetic trees, and identified 355 protein clusters that were probably common to the LUCA. The results \"depict LUCA as anaerobic, CO-fixing, H-dependent with a Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (the reductive acetyl-coenzyme A pathway), N-fixing and thermophilic. LUCA's biochemistry was replete with FeS clusters and radical reaction mechanisms.\" The cofactors also reveal \"dependence upon transition metals, ﬂavins, S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A, ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium. Its genetic code required nucleoside modifications and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylations.\" The results are \"quite specific\": they show that methanogenic clostria was a basal clade in the 355 lineages examined, and that the LUCA may therefore have inhabited an anaerobic hydrothermal vent setting in a geochemically active environment rich in H, CO, and iron. \n\nThese findings could mean that life on Earth originated in such hydrothermal vents, but it is also possible that life was restricted to such locations at some later time, perhaps by the Late Heavy Bombardment. The identification of these genes as being present in LUCA has also been criticized, as they may simply represent later genes which migrated via horizontal gene transfers between archaea and bacteria.\n"}

Truman against an armed attack on November 1, 1950 at Blair House, where the president was living during renovations at the White House.\n\nCoffelt was wounded during the assassination attempt, which two Puerto Rican nationalists carried out. Though mortally wounded by three bullets, Coffelt returned fire moments later and killed one of the attackers with a single shot to the head. The other was convicted by a federal jury and sentenced to death; Truman commuted the sentence to life imprisonment and the man was released from jail in 1979.\n\nAcknowledging the importance of the question of Puerto Rico's status, Truman authorized a referendum in Puerto Rico in 1952 to determine its relationship to the U.S.\n\nLeslie Coffelt was born to Will Coffelt and Effie Keller in the Shenandoah Valley town of Oranda, Virginia. His siblings were Harry, Hollis, Norman, and Mildred. He grew up hunting and handling firearms. Coffelt was the second in his family to graduate from high school, and he was described by those who knew him as an expert sharpshooter. He grew up to be a quiet, good-humored man who was well liked.\n\nCoffelt met and fell in love with Chessie Elinor Morgan of Uniontown, Pennsylvania, who was training to become a nurse. Coffelt and Morgan were married on October 5, 1937, in Prince George's County, Maryland. They moved into an apartment in Washington. Coffelt was also a Freemason and a member of Potomac Lodge #5 F.A.A.M. in Georgetown, Washington D.C.\n\nIn 1928, Coffelt left Oranda to look for a job in Washington, D.C., and became a police officer with the Metropolitan Police Department in 1929. He was assigned to Precinct 3, which ran the length of K Street. In 1936, he resigned to become a building technician.\n\nIn 1941, Coffelt returned to the Metropolitan Police. In 1942 he requested and was awarded a transfer to the White House Police.\n\nThat year, as the US entered World War II, Coffelt was drafted and assigned to B Company, 300th Infantry Regiment, United States Army. Coffelt served less than two years and never made it overseas; the Army gave him a medical discharge. In 1945, he returned to duty with the White House Police.\n\nOn November 1, 1950 would-be assassins Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo, Nationalists who supported the independence of Puerto Rico from the United States, attacked officers at the Blair House in order to assassinate President Truman. He was living there because of a major renovation at the White House for structural problems.\n\nTorresola approached from the west side while Collazo engaged Secret Service agents and White House policemen from the east. Torresola approached the guard booth at the west corner of the Blair House and fired at Coffelt from close range. His three shots struck Coffelt in the chest and abdomen, mortally wounding him. A fourth shot passed through the policeman's tunic.\n\nTorresola shot two other policemen before running out of ammunition, then moved to the left of the Blair House steps to reload. Coffelt went out of his booth and fired at Torresola from 31 feet away, hitting him behind the ear and killing him instantly. Coffelt limped back to the booth and blacked out. He died of his wounds four hours later in a hospital.\n\nPresident Truman wrote in a letter a short time later:\nI'm sorry I didn’t get to talk to you and (cousin) Nellie at the dinner or after it. But I'm really a prisoner now.\n\n...The grand guards who were hurt in the attempt on me didn't have a fair chance. The one who was killed was just cold bloodedly murdered before he could do anything. But his assassin did not live but a couple of minutes – one of the S.S. \"(Secret Service)\" men put a bullet in one ear and it came out the other...\n\nThe S.S. chief said to me, \"Mr. President, don't you know that when there's an Air Raid Alarm you don't run out and look up, you go for cover.\" I saw the point but it was over then.\n\nHope it won't happen again. They won't let me go walking or even cross the street on foot. I say 'they' won't, but it causes them so much anguish that I conform ... But I want no more guards killed. - Letter from Truman to his cousin, Ethel Noland, dated November 17, 1950\n\nCoffelt's widow, Cressie E. Coffelt, was later asked by the President and the Secretary of State to go to Puerto Rico, to accept the condolences and expressions of sorrow for her husband's death from various Puerto Rican leaders and crowds. Mrs. Coffelt made a speech acknowledging that the island's people were not responsible for the acts of Collazo and Torresola.\n\nOscar Collazo was convicted and sentenced to death in federal court; Truman commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. Acknowledging the importance of the question of Puerto Rican independence, Truman allowed a plebiscite in Puerto Rico in 1952 to determine the status of its relationship to the U.S. The people voted to continue as a Free Associated State, as established in 1950.\n\nPrivate Coffelt was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on November 4, 1950 in Section 17, Site 17719-59. His epitaph reads, \"White House Policeman: Who Gave His Life in Defense of the President of the United States During an Assassination Attempt at the Blair House, Washington, D.C.\" To this day, Coffelt is one of only four Secret Service members to take a bullet while defending the President, the others being Donald Birdzell and Joseph Downs, who were wounded during the same incident, and Tim McCarthy. McCarthy was wounded in the abdomen by John Hinckley, Jr. during the Ronald Reagan assassination attempt. Coffelt is still the only Secret Service member to have been killed whilst defending a U.S. President.\n\nA plaque at the Blair House commemorates Coffelt's sacrifice, heroism, and fidelity to his duty and his country. The day room for the U.S. Secret Service's Uniformed Division at the Blair House is named for Coffelt as well.\n\nIn 1979, President Jimmy Carter commuted Collazo's sentence to time served, and granted the man release. Collazo returned to Puerto Rico, where he died in 1994.\n\n\n"}

The female holotype measured 26 mm, (excluding the legs), with two black and three white stripes of setae on its cephalothorax, black setae on its chelicerae, and scattered dots and patterns of black and white setae on its abdomen.\n\nThis species was named after Aragog, the fictional spider from \"Harry Potter\" series by J.K. Rowling, as it resembled the animatronic puppet version of this character created for the movie \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\". Another reason for this eponymy was the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the whole \"Harry Potter\" series in 2017. The single specimen was collected by Iranian entomologist Alireza Naderi in a mountainous region of southeastern Iran's Kerman Province on April 26, 2016, almost 19 years to the day after Aragog died (April 20, 1997, according to the \"Harry Potter\" series), and later described by arachnologists Anton Nadolny and Alireza Zamani in a paper published in the journal \"Zootaxa\".\n"}

When I was younger, I became a fighter because I had to survive. I had nothing. I had no one to depend on except myself. I realized that boxing was something I was good at, and I trained hard so that I could keep myself and my family alive.\"\n\nIn July 2017, after his controversial defeat to Jeff Horn, Pacquiao said: \"I love this sport and until the passion is gone, I will continue to fight for God, my family, my fans and my country.\"\n\nAs of July 2018, he is the current WBA (Regular) welterweight champion.\n\nIn October 2018, Pacquiao signed with Al Haymon.\n\nOn April 17, 2014, Pacquiao announced his intentions to join the Philippine Basketball Association as the playing coach of Kia Motors Basketball team, an incoming expansion team for the PBA's 2014–15 season. Though he can be the head coach of the incoming team, the league's commissioner, Atty. Chito Salud, clarified that all incoming players should join the PBA draft. Pacquiao plays basketball as cross-training to keep himself in shape. He previously played in the semi-professional basketball league, Liga Pilipinas, for the MP-Gensan Warriors, a team that he also owns. He made his debut in the Smart-Liga Pilipinas Conference II in January 16, 2009.\n\nAfter the decision, he was criticized by others specifically online by netizens, saying that Pacquiao could not handle boxing together with basketball. Pacquiao stated, \"It will serve as a challenge for me, they do not know what they are saying, before I have also experienced this before I started boxing, but I proved them wrong.\"\nOn July 9, 2014, he submitted his application for the upcoming rookie draft to the commissioner's office. His camp also hopes that the board of governors \"respect\" his request to be not drafted until Kia's turn.\n\nPacquiao also owns a team in the PBA Developmental League (PBA D-League), the MP Hotel Warriors, which debuted in the league's 2014–15 season.

Speculations swirled about Pacquiao possibly signing with the Blackwater Elite after its owner Dioceldo Sy said in an interview that he offered Pacquiao a roster spot and a coaching job. Four weeks later, his coaching contract with the Kia Picanto also expired, effectively making him available in the free agent market both as a coach and a player.\n\nOn September 3, 2018, Pacquiao played for the Senate Defenders team in the UNTV Cup Season 7. He scored 14 points in a winning effort for his tournament debut.\n\n\"Correct as of February 18, 2018\"\n\nOn February 12, 2007, Pacquiao officially announced that he would be running for a seat in the Philippine House of Representatives in the May 2007 legislative election, aiming to represent the 1st District of South Cotabato province. He would run as the candidate of the Liberal Party faction under Manila mayor Lito Atienza that had affiliated with the government of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Pacquiao, who has himself been known to be supportive of the Arroyo government, said that he was persuaded to run by local officials of General Santos City, who hoped he would act as a bridge between their interests and the national government. But after the Philippine Supreme Court declared null and void all nominations of the Liberal Party faction under Atienza, Pacquiao ran under the Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino (KAMPI), a pro-Arroyo political party. Pacquiao was defeated in the election by incumbent Rep. Darlene Antonino-Custodio of the Nationalist People's Coalition, who said, \"More than anything, I think, people weren't prepared to lose him as their boxing icon.\"\n\nOn November 21, 2009, Pacquiao confirmed that he would run again for the congressional seat, but this time in Sarangani province, the hometown of his wife Jinkee.

Villar said arrangements were made to accommodate Pacquiao's People's Champ Movement in a coalition with the Nacionalista Party for the May 2010 elections in Sarangani.\n\nOn May 13, 2010, Pacquiao was officially proclaimed congressman of the lone district of Sarangani. He scored a landslide victory over the wealthy and politically well-entrenched Chiongbian clan that had been in power in the province for more than thirty years.

Carpio in the Provincial Capitol of Sarangani in Municipality of Alabel. He announced that he would transfer to President-elect Benigno \"Noynoy\" Aquino III's Liberal Party from Nacionalista Party as he wanted to ensure the entry of more projects to his province.\n\nPacquiao later moved to the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) led by Vice-President Jejomar Binay. He took his oath on April 16, 2012 in front of PDP-LABAN President and Senator Aquilino Pimentel III and Secretary-General Joey de Venecia in preparation for the upcoming 2013 elections. In congressional elections in 2013 he ran unopposed for his second term as congressman. Additionally, his wife, Jinkee, was also elected as Vice-Governor of Sarangani, while his younger brother, Rogelio was defeated by incumbent Rep. Pedro Acharon of Team PNoy in second district race in South Cotabato which includes General Santos City.\nDuring the Sarangani's 1st district state of the district address on October 5, 2015, Pacquiao formally declared that he was running for Senator under the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) party of Vice President Jejomar Binay. On May 19, 2016, Pacquiao was formally proclaimed as one of the winners of Philippine Senate seats by the Commission on Elections. At the proclamation ceremony, an elections commissioner introduced Pacquiao as the people's champion and called out his name in the same slow style that he is introduced in his world-famous bouts, drawing cheers from the audience. Pacquiao garnered more than 16 million votes, landing 7th among 12 new members of the Senate.\nAs Senator Pacquiao has supported bringing back Capital punishment in the Philippines.\n\nHe also has endorsed politicians outside the Philippines, in particular his secondary home country in the United States, as he endorsed Nevada Senator Harry Reid and California Governor Jerry Brown in November 2010.

The movie is titled so because (according to director Tony Bernal), being a boxer, Pacquiao is licensed to use his hands.\n\nIn 2008, Pacquiao starred with Ara Mina and Valerie Concepcion in \"Anak ng Kumander\" (Son of Commander). The movie was not a commercial success and was panned by critics.\n\nPacquiao starred in the superhero/comedy film entitled \"Wapakman\", which was released on December 25, 2009 as an entry to the 2009 Metro Manila Film Festival.

Swimmer Miguel Molina, 2005 Southeast Asian Games' Best Male Athlete, yielded the honor to Pacquiao, upon the request of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to the national sports officials on the Philippines at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\nVarious business sectors have solicited Pacquiao's help in endorsing their products through commercial advertisements in print and in broadcast media. These include detergents, medicines, foods, beverage, garments, telecommunications and even a political ad for politicians during the 2007 and 2010 Philippine elections. Additionally, Pacquiao appeared in commercials for Nike's \"Fast Forward\" campaign (with Tiger Woods, Kobe Bryant, Maria Sharapova, Roger Federer, Cristiano Ronaldo and Liu Xiang). Pacquiao also appeared in a commercial for San Miguel Beer with Jet Li and Érik Morales.\n\nPacquiao was one of \"Time's\" 100 most influential people for the year 2009, for his exploits in boxing and his influence among the Filipino people. Pacquiao was also included by \"Forbes\" in its annual Celebrity 100 list for the year 2009, joining Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie and fellow athletes Tiger Woods and Bryant.\n\n\"Forbes\" also listed Pacquiao as the world's equal sixth highest paid athlete, with a total of $40 million or ₱2 billion pesos (₱2,000,000,000.00) from the second half of 2008 to the first half of 2009. Tied with him on the sixth spot was NBA player LeBron James and golfer Phil Mickelson. Pacquiao was again included in \"Forbes\"' list of highest paid athletes from the second half of 2009 to the first half of 2010; he was ranked eighth with an income of $42 million. Pacquiao also won the 2009 ESPY Awards for the Best Fighter category, beating fellow boxer Shane Mosley and Brazilian mixed martial arts fighters Lyoto Machida and Anderson Silva. ESPN Magazine reported that Pacquiao was one of the two top earning athletes for 2010, alongside American Major League Baseball player Alex Rodriguez. According to the magazine's annual salary report of athletes, Pacquiao earned $32 million (approximately PhP 1.38 billion) for his two 2010 boxing matches against Clottey and Margarito.\n\nPacquiao has also appeared on the cover of \"Time\" magazine Asia for their November 16, 2009 issue. According to their five-page feature story, \"(Pacquiao is) a fighter with enough charisma, intelligence and backstory to help rescue a sport lost in the labyrinth of pay-per-view. Global brands like Nike want him in their ads.\" They also added, \"Pacquiao has a myth of origin equal to that of any Greek or Roman hero. He leaves the Philippines to make it even bigger, conquering the world again and again to bring back riches to his family and friends.\" Pacquiao became the eighth Filipino to grace the cover of the prestigious magazine, after former Philippine presidents Manuel L. Quezon, Ramon Magsaysay, Ferdinand Marcos, Corazon Aquino, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Benigno Aquino III and Filipino actress and environmentalist Chin Chin Gutierrez. Pacquiao was also featured on the cover of Reader's Digest Asia, where a seven-page story was written about the Filipino boxing superstar. The issue came out before Pacquiao's epic match against De La Hoya on November 2008.\n\nPacquiao is also mentioned in some hip hop tracks including Kool A.D.'s song entitled \"Manny Pacquiao\" on his mixtape, \"51\". A few notable ones are Pitbull's \"Get It Started\", A$AP Rocky's \"Phoenix\", Bad Meets Evil and Bruno Mars' \"Lighters\", Eminem and Skylar Grey's \"Asshole\", Future's \"Never Gon' Lose\", Migos' \"Chinatown\", Nicki Minaj and Ciara's \"I'm Legit\" and Rick Ross's \"High Definition\", to name a few.\n\nOn November 26, 2013, a few days after Pacquiao's victory over Brandon Rios, the Philippine Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued a freeze order on all of Pacquiao's Philippine bank accounts due to his alleged failure to pay ₱2.2 billion in taxes for earnings he made in his fights in the United States from 2008 to 2009. A day after the bank account freeze, the BIR also issued an order to freeze all of Pacquiao's Philippine properties, whereupon Pacquiao presented documents to the press showing the income tax for non-resident alien payment by his promoter to the BIR's US counterpart, the Internal Revenue Service, as well as a letter from Bob Arum. In April 2017, Pacquiao, now a senator, approached Philippine authorities in an attempt to settle the case. The BIR had maintained that taxes were due even if all taxes had been paid to the IRS in the first place.\n\nIn May 2012, Pacquiao was mistakenly quoted as saying \"gay men should be put to death.\" Pacquiao did not say those words. Granville Ampong, the writer who wrote the article containing the Bible verse, said that it was he and not Pacquiao who quoted the verse in his article. \n\nPacquiao is against same-sex marriage and quoted as saying \"God only expects man and women to be together and to be legally married.\"\n\nIn February 2016, Pacquiao, in a video statement posted by TV5, made a comment on the issue of same-sex marriage. Pacquiao, in vernacular, described people in same-sex marriages as behaving worse than animals because animals generally do not have same-sex mating. LGBT celebrities including comedian Vice Ganda, singer Aiza Seguerra, TV host Boy Abunda and the party-list Ladlad criticized the statements of the senatorial candidate. Pacquiao later apologized and stated that while, as a Christian, he is still against same-sex marriage, which is against Biblical teachings, and he did not condemn gay people themselves, saying that he loves them all and is praying for them. Nike ended their longtime partnership with Pacquiao stating his comments against gay people were abhorrent. The Grove at Farmers Market in Los Angeles also banned Pacquiao from the shopping mall.\n\nTowards the end of the video, Pacquiao clarified that he is not condemning gay people.\n\nIt was revealed following Mayweather vs. Pacquiao that Pacquiao had sustained an undisclosed injury to his right shoulder while training, and that while it had healed in time for the fight, he re-injured it during the 4th round. , Pacquiao is currently facing a lawsuit of 5 million dollars filed against him by two fans for failing to disclose the shoulder injury in the lead up to his bout with Floyd Mayweather. Pacquiao failed to disclose the injury to the Nevada State Athletic Commission in the pre-fight injury evaluation. The commission did a standard injury report with Pacquiao filling out the form saying that he had no injuries heading into the bout. Pacquiao said he had sustained the injury weeks out from the fight against Mayweather. However, after the lawsuit from the two fans was filed against him, Pacquiao has since said that he sustained the injury during the fight in which it flared up in the 3rd round. The Nevada State Athletic Commission stated at the post fight press conference that they had only just found out about Pacquiao's injury that evening at the post fight press conference. Speculation arose that the injury was an excuse for the loss to Mayweather because Pacquiao did not mention an injury in the post fight interview with Max Kellerman. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum stated that Pacquiao suffered the injury back in 2008, causing even more confusion as Pacquiao, now facing a lawsuit, had just previously stated that he suffered the injury during the fight.\n\nInternational:\n\nNational:\n\n"}

The accused in the murder included relatives of Babli (grandfather Gangaraj, who is said to have been a Khap leader, brother, maternal and paternal uncles and two cousins). Relatives of Manoj, especially his mother, defended the relationship. The killing was ordered by a \"khap panchayat\" (\"khap\"), a religious caste-based council among Jats, in their Karora village in Kaithal district, Haryana. The \"khap\" passed a decree prohibiting marriage against societal norms. Such caste-based councils are common in the inner regions of several Indian states, including Haryana, Punjab, western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan, and have been operating with government approval for years. In any event, the state government expressed no concern about the ruling of the \"khap panchayat\".\n\nThe Khap panchayat's ruling was based on the assumption that Manoj and Babli belonged to the Banwala gotra, a Jat community, and were therefore considered to be siblings despite not being directly related and any union between them would be invalid and incestuous. Nevertheless, the couple went ahead with their marriage, following which they were abducted and killed by Babli's relatives.\n\nIn March 2010, a Karnal district court sentenced the five perpetrators to be executed, the first time an Indian court had done so in an honour killing case. The khap head who ordered but did not take part in the killings received a life sentence, and the driver involved in the abduction a seven-year prison term. According to Home Minister P. Chidambaram, the UPA-led central government was to propose an amendment to the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in response to the deaths of Manoj and Babli, making honour killings a \"distinct offense\".\n\nManoj's and Babli's families lived in Karoran Village, Kaithal. Manoj's mother, Chanderpati Berwal, had four children, of whom Manoj was the eldest. Chanderpati was widowed at the age of 37, when Manoj was only 9. Manoj owned an electronics repair shop at Kaithal and was the only member of his family earning a livelihood. Manoj's cousin, Narender, lived with the family and worked in Panchkula.\n\nBabli's mother, Ompati, also had four children, including eldest son, Suresh. Like Manoj, Suresh was the only bread winner of the family. Babli was still studying in school. Ompati is a widow.\n\nIn 2005, Manoj and Babli began to show interest in each other. Manoj was four years older than Babli. All residents of Karora village belong to the same clan, Banwala, a Jat community, and marrying within the clan is considered incest. Chanderpati recalled, \"We knew about Babli long before they decided to marry each other. She would call up often and I would sermonise to her about staying away from Manoj, fearing the fallout of such an alliance. They were, however, unconcerned and chatted for hours together. If I did walk into the room while they were talking, Manoj would quickly disconnect the phone and run off to avoid any questioning.\" She continued, \"I even went to Babli's house and told her mother that Manoj and Babli were seeing each other. I asked her to dissuade Babli or quickly marry her off before word of their dalliance spread.\"\n\nTwo years later, on 5 April 2007, Chanderpati last saw Manoj. \"He ate his food and left to sleep at the shop since he had a class XII compartment exam in English to take the next day. Unlike other days, next morning, he did not show up.\" The following day Babli's uncle arrived to speak with Manoj. According to Chanderpati, \"He said he had come to recover some money that Manoj had borrowed, had tea and left when I told him that Manoj was away for an exam. We only discovered late in the evening that Babli, too, was missing and the two had run away.\" Manoj had eloped with Babli to Chandigarh and married her on 7 April at a Durga temple, their commitment to one another transcending their willingness to abide by societal norms.\n\nFurious with the marriage, Babli's family asked for intervention from the local \"khap panchayat\", which annulled the marriage. The \"khap\" also announced a social boycott on Manoj's family. Anyone who kept ties with them would be fined Rs. 25,000. Ompati tried to persuade her family that Babli did nothing dishonourable and that she and Manoj would move back home soon.\n\nOn 26 April, Babli's family filed a First Information Report (FIR) against Manoj and his family for kidnapping Babli. On 15 June, Manoj went to court with Babli, testifying that they had married in conformity with the law and that he did not kidnap Babli. The judge ordered police protection for the two. Chandrapati did not attend the trial so that Babli's family would not be aware that Manoj and Babli were in town.\n\nAfter the trial, Manoj and Babli, accompanied by a team of five police officers assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away. Suspecting foul play, Manoj and Babli did not continue toward Chandigarh, instead boarding a bus for Karnal. According to a statement filed by Chanderpati, later that day, around 3:40 pm, she received a call from a Pipli telephone booth from Manoj, who said that the police had deserted them, and Babli's family members were trailing them, so they would try to take a bus to Delhi and call her back later. Babli asked for acceptance from Chanderpati, who replied affirmatively. That was the last time Manoj's family heard from the couple.\n\nOn 20 June, Chanderpati's complaint regarding the kidnapping was filed as an FIR at the Bhutana police station following media pressure on the police.\n\nThe couple's bus left for Delhi, but \"en route\" at 4:30 pm, Babli's relatives stopped the bus near Raipur Jatan village, about from Pipli. They kidnapped the couple in a Scorpio SUV driven by Mandeep Singh. Kuldip Thekedar, a road contractor, witnessed the kidnapping and filed a complaint at the Butana police station in Karnal district, giving the licence plate number of the Scorpio. Later, Chanderpati ascribed the murder to the unauthorised withdrawal of the couple's security team ignoring the orders given by the district and sessions judge (DSJ) of Kaithal. Upon receiving no further news, Chanderpati's nephew, Narendra Singh traced the contractor, and after he was shown a photo of the couple, the contractor recognised the couple. The family then understood that Manoj and Babli were the victims of the kidnapping.\n\nAfter the kidnapping, the couple were beaten. Babli's brother Suresh forced her to consume pesticide, while four other family members pushed Manoj to the ground, her uncle Rajinder pulling a noose around Manoj's neck and strangling him in front of Babli. They wrapped the bodies in gunny sacks and dumped them in Barwala Link Canal in Hisar district. On 23 June, nine days later, their mutilated bodies, hands and feet tied, were fished out of the canal by Kheri Chowki police. After autopsy, police preserved Manoj's shirt and Babli's anklet and cremated the bodies as unclaimed on 24 June. On 1 July the family identified them by the remnants of their clothing. The accused were subsequently arrested.\n\nPolice discovered a number of articles in the Scorpio used to kidnap the couple—parts of Babli's anklet, two buttons from Manoj's shirt, and torn photographs of the couple. Manoj's purse was found on one of the accused.\n\nAs no Karnal lawyer would take up the case, Manoj's family had to find lawyers from Hisar. Later on Adv. Sunil Rana from Karnal accepted the case, arguing on their behalf public prosecutor Sunil Rana and lawyers Lal Bahadur, Surat Singh, Cornel Omparkash, and Rakesh Manjhu from Hisar, Haryana. Bahadur argued that the couples' clothes recovered from the canal and photographs from the Scorpio established that day's happenings. Bahadur also cited the contractor's statement and the last phone call from Manoj, in which Manoj had related that Babli's relatives were trailing them. However, the contractor \"turned hostile\" and withdrew his statement.\n\nArguing for the defence was lawyer Jagmal Singh. He asserted that there was no evidence against the accused and that it was all contrived by the media, no evidence that the \"khap panchayat\" ever met to discuss the fate of the couple, and no evidence indicating that Manoj and Babli were dead. The cremated bodies recovered from the canal were never confirmed to be those of Manoj and Babli.\n\nOn 29 March 2010, after 33 months of 50 hearings with 41 witnesses, the Karnal District court found the accused guilty of murder, kidnapping, conspiracy, and destroying evidence under respective sections in the IPC. The next day, 30 March, for the first time in Haryana state history, a death penalty verdict was announced in the double murder case for the five accused. All were related to Babli, and included her brother Suresh, cousins Gurdev and Satish, paternal uncle Rajender, and maternal uncle Baru Ram. The leader of the \"khap panchayat\" Ganga Raj (52), was given a life sentence for conspiracy, while the driver, Mandeep Singh, held guilty of kidnapping, was given a jail term of seven years. The court asked the Haryana government to provide a compensation of Rs. 100,000 to Chanderpati, who had filed the case. Ganga Raj was fined Rs. 16,000, and the other six convicts Rs. 6,000 each.\n\nThe court also accused six police personnel of dereliction of duty and directed the SSP of Kaithal to take action against them. The personnel included head constable Jayender Singh, sub-inspector Jagbir Singh, and the members of the escort party provided to the couple. They claimed that the couple wanted them to leave. The SSP's statement was that \"[i]t is correct that the deceased couple had given in writing not to take police security any further, but Jagbir Singh was well aware that there was a threat to their lives from the relatives of the girl.\" The report stated that Jayender informed Gurdev Singh of the location of the police and that of Manoj and Babli over his mobile phone. Jayender was dismissed from the police force, and both he and Jagbir were penalised by a cut of two increments.\n\nIn her verdict, district judge Vani Gopal Sharma stated, \"This court has gone through sleepless nights and tried to put itself in the shoes of the offenders and think as to what might have prompted them to take such a step.\" \"Khap panchayats have functioned contrary to the constitution, ridiculed it and have become a law unto themselves.\"\n\nBahadur was satisfied with the decision, \"Out of seven accused, five have been given death sentences. This will send a strong message to the public that law is greater than the khap.\" However, he was disappointed that \"the leader [Ganga Raj] got away with death penalty because he intentionally disappeared during the killing.\" Narendra said, \"We will appeal in High Court for death penalty to the main accused, Ganga Raj. We respect the court's decision but he should be punished so that the instigators of the crime get the punishment. Also it is important that it is a very clear message so that no khap gives such directions, ever.\" Seema seconded Narendra's concerns, \"We would have been happier if the main accused was also given the death sentence. The decision of the panchayat was not justified and people should not to be allowed to misuse their power. We have fought this battle alone when no one was supporting us.\" She requested more security for her family, \"They tried to bribe us to withdraw the case then they threatened that they would kill us if we didn't withdraw the FIR. Even after the decision we're afraid of a backlash from the Khap Panchayat.\"\n\nThe case was the first resulting in the conviction of \"khap panchayats\" and the first capital punishment verdict in an honour killing case in India. The Indian media and legal experts hailed it as a \"landmark judgement\", a victory over these infamous assemblies, which acted for years with impunity as parallel judicial bodies. Also, few honour killing cases went to court, and this was the first case in which the groom's family in an honour killing filed the case. In a statement to the press, former Home Minister Chidambaram slammed the \"khap panchayats\", asking tersely, \"Who are these khap panchayats? Who gave them the right to kill in the name of honour?\"\n\nSurat Singh, director of the Haryana Institute of Rural Development, Nilokheri, anticipated that the verdict will end the diktats of \"khap panchayats\". The \"khaps\" had never worried before because their \"political bosses refrained people from acting against them. With this verdict, those who try to impose a medieval order on society will think twice\". Political analyst Ranbir Singh agreed that the judgement will \"act as a deterrent\". Additional Advocate General Arun Walia hailed the decision: \"before passing ruthless judgments, the members will surely take note of this decision\".\n\nThe honour killing inspired Ajay Sinha to produce a film titled \"Khap—A Story of Honour Killing\" starring Om Puri, Yuvika Chaudhary, Govind Namdeo, Anuradha Patel, and Mohnish Behl, to raise awareness about the \"khap\"s diktats. It will cost ₨25–30 million and was expected to enter theatres by late July 2010. Sinha claimed that the film is based on not one distinct killing but many. He considered the film \"a protest against such traditions and practice\". For research, Sinha had visited Haryana and spoken to \"khap\" members.\n\nDays after the verdict, a \"The Times of India\" headline hailed Chanderpati, who struggled years for justice, as \"Mother Courage\" for having done \"what even top politicians and bureaucrats have shied away from doing—taken on the dreaded khap panchayats.\" Chanderpati now lives with her two daughters and remaining son under the protection of two policemen. She withdrew her daughter Rekha from public school and sent Vinod to a school in another district. Chanderpati also reported threats from villagers, \"The villagers have threatened to eliminate us. I am enemy number one and my son is a culprit. We've been told our ordeal can end if we withdraw the police case but we refused. So, the nightmare continues.\"\n\nChanderpati has stated she intends to continue until Ganga Raj is sentenced to death: \"Our fight has not ended here. We will not rest till he [Ganga Raj] also gets the death penalty.\" The \"khap panchayats\" remain defiant even after the verdict. \"The verdict has done justice to my son's death, but it has not changed the way the village works,\" Chanderpati said. \"I am fighting but my son died only because the girl's male relatives could kill their own sister. Families allow themselves to be instigated. As long as men can kill their own daughters, what change will there be?\"\n\nJudge Vani Gopal Sharma has supposedly been receiving threats since her verdict in the case. The High Court had directed adequate security to be provided to her, but later she again informed the High Court of the failure to increase security. She sought transfer to Panchkula, a city near Chandigarh. She requested this shortly after her verdict was denounced vehemently by the \"khap panchayats\". The police chief of Karnal district, Rakesh Kumar Arya, claimed that Sharma did not complain about inadequate security. \"There is no truth in reports that Karnal's Additional District Sessions Judge wants to move out of the district on account of inadequate security,\" he said. \"I don't know whether any such request was made, but it looks unlikely.\"\n\nA \"maha khap panchayat\" (grand caste council) representing 20 \"khap panchayats\" of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan held a meeting on 13 April 2010, in Kurukshetra to challenge the court verdict and support those sentenced to death in the case. They planned to raise money for the families of the convicts to hire top lawyers for the appeal. Each family in Haryana that was part of a \"khap panchayat\" was to contribute ₨10. They also demanded that the Hindu Marriage Act be amended to ban same-gotra marriages.\n\nThe \"khaps\" threatened to boycott any MP and assembly member from Haryana who did not back the \"khaps\" request. They also blocked the Kurukshetra-Kaithal highway in protest.\n\nDissatisfied with the decision at the April meeting, the \"maha khap panchayat\" called another meeting on 23 May in Jind to discuss their plans.\n\nAfter the court judgement, state authorities began to take on the \"khap panchayats\", and consequently, many village sarpanches (village heads) supporting these councils were suspended. Top Jat leader and former minister Shamsher Singh Surjewala said, \"The diktats and fatwas issued by so-called gotra khaps on breaking of marriages and other similar issues would lead to 'Talibanisation' of society as such decisions were illegal and against the constitution.\"\n\nOn 5 August 2010, in a Parliament session, Chidambaram proposed a bill that included \"public stripping of women and externment of young couples from villages and any 'act which is humiliating will be punished with severity in the definition of honour killing and that would \"make khap-dictated honour killings a distinct offence so that all those who participate in the decision are liable to attract the death sentence\". He insinuated that the proposed law would place the \"onus of proof on the accused\". A July 2010 \"The Times of India\" article anticipated that the bill would not pass in the monsoon session of Parliament in the same year.\nThe accused appealed to the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Ganga Raj's appeal for parole was declined. On 13 May 2010, the court admitted the appeal of him and the other six convicts challenging the court's verdict. On 11 March, the Punjab and Haryana High Court commuted the death sentence awarded to four convicts – Babli's brother Suresh, uncles Rajender and Baru Ram and Gurdev in the Manoj–Babli honour killing case to life imprisonment. Ganga Raj, said to be the prime conspirator, and another convict Satish were acquitted. In an interview to Newsclick, Manoj's relatives – Seema and Chanderpati affirmed that they would challenge Ganga Raj's and Satish's acquittal in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe June 3, 2012, episode, \"\" of TV series, \"Satyamev Jayate\", hosted by actor Aamir Khan, featured an interview with Manoj’s sister Seema and mother and Chandrapati Banwala. The episode discussed this incident along with other cases in the episode.\n\nIn August 2013, senior journalist Chander Suta Dogra, published a book, \"Manoj and Babli: A Hate Story\" (Penguin) based on the honour killing case.\n\nIn 2015, a Bollywood Hindi film \"Guddu Rangeela\" used Manoj–Babli honour killing case in its storyline. Also in 2015, the Bollywood film \"NH10\" was released to critical and public acclaim with a story-line loosely based on this case.\n\n"}

Mukesh is considered to be one of the most popular and acclaimed playback singers of the Hindi film industry. Amongst the numerous nominations and awards he won, his song \"Kai Baar Yuhi Dekha Hai\" from the film \"Rajnigandha\" (1973) won him the National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer.\n\nMukesh was also popular as being the voice of actors Raj Kapoor, Manoj Kumar, Feroz Khan, Sunil Dutt and Dilip Kumar.\n\nMukesh was born in Delhi in Hindu Kayastha family. His parents were Zorawar Chand Mathur, an engineer, and Chandrani Mathur. He was the sixth in a family of ten children. The music teacher who came home to teach Mukesh's sister, Sundar Pyari, found a pupil in Mukesh, who would listen from the adjoining room. Mukesh left school after the 10th grade and worked briefly for the Department of Public Works. He experimented with voice recordings during his employment in Delhi and gradually developed his singing abilities and also his musical instrumental skills.\n\nMukesh's voice was first noticed by Motilal, a distant relative, when he sang at his sister's wedding. Motilal took him to Mumbai and arranged for singing lessons by Pandit Jagannath Prasad. During this period Mukesh was offered a role as an actor-singer in a Hindi film, \"Nirdosh\" (1941). His first song was \"Dil Hi Bujha Hua Ho To\" as an actor-singer for \"Nirdosh\". He got his break as a playback singer for actor Motilal in 1945 with the film \"Pehli Nazar\" with music composed by Anil Biswas and lyrics written by Aah Sitapuri. The first song that he sang for a Hindi film was \"Dil Jalta Hai To Jalne De\".\n\nMukesh was such a fan of singer K. L. Saigal that in his early years of playback singing he used to imitate his idol. In fact, it is said that when K. L. Saigal first heard the song \"Dil Jalta Hai...\", he remarked, \"That's strange, I don't recall singing that song\".\n\nMukesh created his own singing style with the help of music director Naushad Ali, who helped Mukesh to come out of his Saigal style and create his own style. Naushad gave him songs for the film \"Andaz\". Initially Mukesh was the ghost voice of Dilip Kumar in this movie and Mohammed Rafi sang for Raj Kapoor. He delivered many Hits for Naushad in films like: \"Anokhi Ada\" (1948), \"Mela\" (1948), \"Andaz\" (1949). Other composers who used Mukesh voice for great Dilip Kumar in hit songs like \"Jeevan Sapna toot gaya\" were Anil Biswas in Anokha Pyar, Ye Mera Diwanapan hai, Shankar-Jaikishan in Yahudi and Suhana Safar and Dil Tadap Tadap ke, Salil Choudhary in Madhumati. However, later Dilip Kumar choose Rafi as his ghost voice and Mukesh became the ghost voice of Raj Kapoor. Mukesh recorded highest number of songs for Shankar Jaikishan ie 133 songs followed by kalyanji Anandji ie 99 songs. Out of 4 Filmfare awards, Mukesh won 3 awards for Shankar Jaikishan songs \n\nIn 1974, Mukesh received National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song \"Kai Baar Yuhi Dekha Hai\" from \"Rajnigandha\" (1974), and Filmfare Awards for the songs \"Sab Kuch Seekha Humne\" in the movie \"Anari\" (1959), \"Sabse Bada Naadan Wahi Hai\" in \"Pehchaan\" (1970), \"Jai Bolo Beimaan Ki\" in \"Beimaan\" (1972) (all the three songs composed by Shankar Jaikishan) and \"Kabhi Kabhie Mere Dil Mein\", the title song of film \"Kabhie Kabhie\" (1976) (composed by Khayyam). A total of around 1,300 songs were sung by him. This number is less than those sung by some of his contemporaries, but the fact is that Mukesh emphasised on quality rather than quantity. The comparatively fewer songs sung by him in the 1970s can be attributed to his failing health due to his worsening heart problem.\n\nMukesh sang many songs for Kalyanji Anandji music director duo. Mukesh sang more songs with the K-A duo after Shankar Jaikishan. From \"Naina hai jadoo bhare...\" \"Bedard Zamana Kya Jane\" (1958) composed by Kalyanji alone as Kalyanji Virji Shah, and \"Main hoon mast madari...\" \"Madari\" (1959) as the first Kalyanji-Anandji-Mukesh combo, to \"Chahe aaj mujhe napasand karo\" \"Darinda/ 1977\", the K-A, Mukesh combination gave numerous popular songs like \"Chhalia mera naam...\", \"Mere toote hue dil se...\", \"Dum dum diga diga\" \"Chalia\"(1959), \"Mujhko iss raat ki tanhai mein...\" \"Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere\" (1960), \"Hum chhod chale hain mehfil ko...\" (Ji Chahta Hai), \"Humne tumko pyar kiya hai jitna...\" (Dulha Dulhan), \"Chal mere dil lehraake chal...\" \"Ishara\" and \"Dheere se chalo...\" \"Johar Mehmood in Goa\",\"Main to ek khwab hoon...\" and \"Chand si mehbooba ho...\" \"Himalay Ki Godmein\"(1965), \"Waqt kartaa jo wafaa...\" \"Dil Ne Pukara\",\"Deewanon se yeh mat poocho...\" \"Upkar\", \"Khush raho har khushi hai...\" \"Suhaag Raat\" and \"Humsafar ab yeh safar kat jaayega...\" \"Juari\", \"Chandi ki deewaar...\" and \"Le chal le chal mere jeevan saathi...\" \"Vishwas\" (1969), \"Koi jab tumhara hriday tod de...\" \"Purab Aur Paschim\", \"Darpan ko dekha...\" \"Upaasna\", \"Jo tumko ho pasand...\" \"Safar\" and \"Mujhe nahin poochni tumse beeti baatein...\" \"Anjaan Raahein\" (1970).\n\nOut of the numerous songs he gave his voice to, \"Kahin door jab din dhal Jaaye\" from \"Anand\"(1971), \"Ek Pyaar ka Nagma hai\" from \"Shor\" (1972), \"Maine Tere Liye Hi Saat Rang Ke\" from \"Anand\" (1972), \"Sab Kuch Seekha Humne\" from \"Anari\" (1959), \"Jeena yahan marna yahan\" and \"Kehta hai Joker\" from \"Mera Naam Joker\" (1971) are the most popular among his fans and followers.\n\nMukesh started his career as an actor singer in the film \"Nirdosh\" in 1941, with Nalini Jaywant as his heroine. His second film was \"Adab Arz\" in 1943. He played a guest role in Raj Kapoor's film \"Aah\" in 1953. He acted as a hero in the film \"Mashooka\" in 1953, opposite Suraiya and in the film \"Anurag\" (1956) (he was also the co-producer and composer in the film), opposite Usha Kiran and \"Mridula Rani\". Mukesh also produced a film \"Malhar\" (1951) with hero Arjun & heroine Shammi with Darling Films.\n\nMukesh was a favourite of renowned Indian spin-bowler Bhagwath Chandrasekhar. When the sound of a Mukesh song drifted to the pitch, Chandrasekhar's acknowledgement of the tribute would bring a roar from the crowd. Sunil Gavaskar wrote that sometimes he hummed a Mukesh tune on the field to inspire Chandra. Chandra's passion affected team-mates Kirmani, Gundappa Viswanath, and even some journalists.\n\nGoogle commemorated Mukesh on his 93rd birthday anniversary in 2016.\n\nMukesh married Sarla Trivedi Raichand, daughter of Raichand Trivedi. Sarla's father was a millionaire. With no proper house, an erratic income and what was then considered in India a supposedly \"immoral\" profession (singer in movies), the consent of Sarla's father for this marriage could not be obtained and Mukesh and Sarla were forced to elope. They got married in a temple in Kandivali on 22 July 1946, Mukesh's 23rd birthday, with the help of the actor Motilal and from the residence of R. D. Mathur. Everyone made dire predictions of unhappy days and divorce, but both weathered the lean days and celebrated their thirtieth wedding anniversary on 22 July 1976, four days before his departure for the USA. The couple had five children – Rita, the singer Nitin, Nalini (d. 1978), Mohnish and Namrata (Amrita). The actor Neil Nitin Mukesh is a grandson of Mukesh (son of Nitin).\n\nMukesh died of a heart attack on 27 August 1976 in Detroit, Michigan, US, where he had gone to perform in a concert. That morning, he got up early and went to take a shower. He came out panting and complaining of chest pains. He was rushed to a hospital but was pronounced dead. The rest of the concert was completed by Lata Mangeshkar and surprisingly his son Nitin Mukesh . His body was flown to India by Lata Mangeshkar, where a grand funeral ceremony was held in the presence of several actors, with personalities of the Indian film industry and fans paying tribute. When news of his death reached Raj Kapoor, he burst into tears, and remarked, \"I have lost my voice,\" which is a testimony to the association of Mukesh's voice (in playback) to the immensely popular songs of Raj Kapoor's films. A famous song of the 50's featured on Bharat Bhushan \"Aa laut ke aa ja mere meet\" is another example of his earlier melodies, as is \"Dil tadap tadapke keh raha hai\", picturised on Dilip Kumar.\n\nAfter Mukesh's death, his newer, hitherto unreleased, songs were released in 1977 in films such as \"Dharam Veer\", \"Amar Akbar Anthony\", \"Khel khiladi ka\", \"Darinda\" and \"Chandi sona\". The year 1978 also featured a considerable number of Mukesh's songs in films such as \"Aahuti\", \"Paramatma\", \"Tumhari kasam\" and \"Satyam Shivam Sundaram\", where Mukesh sang his last film song \"Chanchal sheetal nirmal komal\" for Raj Kapoor's younger brother, Shashi Kapoor. From 1980 onward, Mukesh's voice was heard in many later released films such as \"Shaitan mujarim\", \"Premika\", \"Patthar se takkar\" (1980), \"Sanjh ki bela\", \"Maila anchal\" (1981), \"Aarohi\" (1982), \"Chor mandali\" (1983), \"Nirlaj\" (1985), \"Love and God\" (1986), \"Shubh chintak\" (1989), and his last known release of \"Chand grahan\" (1997).\n\n\nWinner\n\n"}
{"id": "4579388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4579388", "title": "Nasir Hussain", "text": "Nasir Hussain\n\nMohammad Nasir Hussain Khan or Nasir Hussain (16 November 1926 – 13 March 2002) was an Indian film producer, director and screenwriter. With a career spanning decades, Hussain has been credited as a major trendsetter in the history of Hindi cinema. For example, he directed \"Yaadon Ki Baraat\" (1973), which created the Bollywood masala film genre that defined Hindi cinema in the 1970s and 1980s, and he wrote and produced \"Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak\" (1988), which set the Bollywood musical romance template that defined Hindi cinema in the 1990s. Akshay Manwani wrote a book on Hussain's cinema titled \"Music, Masti, Modernity: The Cinema of Nasir Husain\".\n\nHussain first worked with Qamar Jalalabadi when he joined Filmistan as a writer in 1948. The famous films he wrote for Filmistan include \"Anarkali\" (1953), \"Munimji\" (1955), and \"Paying Guest\" (1957). Filmistan was the breakaway studio from Bombay Talkies; it used mid-budget formula productions and sold on star value and music. Sashadhar Mukherjee was a part of the breakaway team, and he gave Hussain \"Tumsa Nahin Dekha\" to direct. The film made a star of Shammi Kapoor.\n\nKapoor and Hussain made another hit, \"Dil Deke Dekho\" (1959), for Filmalaya, the breakaway group of Filmistan. The film introduced Asha Parekh, who would be the lead in all of Hussain's films until \"Caravan\" (1971). He was also in a long romantic relationship with her, but it ended because he was already a married man with two children, and Parekh didn't want to be labeled a homewrecker. Hussain's wife was Margaret Francina Lewis, an assistant choreographer he met at Filmistan. They married and then she changed her name to Ayesha Khan. She worked as an assistant choreographer on some of his productions. He outlived his wife.\n\nHussain then set up Nasir Hussain Films and turned producer-director. He made musical hits like \"Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai\" (1961), \"Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon\" (1963), \"Teesri Manzil\" (1966), \"Baharon Ke Sapne\" (1967), \"Pyar Ka Mausam\" (1969), \"Caravan\" (1971), \"Yaadon Ki Baraat\" (1973), and \"Hum Kisise Kum Naheen\" (1977).\n\nHussain, Majrooh Sultanpuri, and R.D. Burman collaborated on \"Teesri Manzil\", \"Baharon Ke Sapne\", \"Pyar Ka Mausam\", \"Caravan\", \"Yaadon Ki Baraat\" and \"Hum Kisise Kum Naheen\".\n\nHussain wrote and produced the musical cult hit \"Teesri Manzil\". Vijay Anand directed the film, which starred Hussain's regular actors Shammi Kapoor and Asha Parekh. Originally Dev Anand was signed for the film but due to differences with Hussain he opted out and Kapoor was cast. He also hired R.D. Burman for the first time to compose the songs (\"O Haseena Zulfonwali\", \"O Mere Sona Re\", \"Deewaana Mujhsa Nahin\", \"Tumne Mujhe Dekha\", \"Aaja Aaja Main Hoon Pyaar Tera\"). After the songs became evergreen hits, Burman would compose for all of Hussain's films for the next 19 years, ending with \"Zabardast\" (1985).\n\nHussain's \"Yaadon Ki Baraat\" was written by Salim-Javed, who had written \"Zanjeer\" the same year. Both films dealt with the hero wanting to avenge his father's death, and both featured Ajit as the villain. \"Yaadon Ki Baraat\" has been identified as the first masala film.\n\nAs \"Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai\" (1981), \"Manzil Manzil\" (1984) and \"Zabardast\" (1985) all flopped, Hussain's son Mansoor Khan took over the reins of Nasir Hussain Films, although Hussain continued to write scripts and dialogues for films like \"Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak\" (1988) and \"Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander\" (1992). In \"Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak\", he introduced his nephew Aamir Khan as a hero. \"Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak\" was a milestone in the history of Hindi cinema, setting the template for Bollywood musical romance films that defined Hindi cinema in the 1990s.\n\nHussain received a special Filmfare Award in 1996 for his contribution to Hindi cinema.\n\nHussain died in Mumbai on 13 March 2002 following a heart attack.

Both terms are often applied to central nervous system infections, although some neurotropic viruses are highly neuroinvasive for the peripheral nervous system (i.e. herpes simplex virus). Important neuroinvasive viruses include poliovirus, which is highly neurovirulent but weakly neuroinvasive, and rabies virus, which is highly neurovirulent but requires tissue trauma (often resulting from an animal bite) to become neuroinvasive. Using these definitions, herpes simplex virus is highly neuroinvasive for the peripheral nervous system and rarely neuroinvasive for the central nervous system, but in the latter case may cause herpesviral encephalitis and is therefore considered highly neurovirulent. Many arthropod-borne neurotropic viruses, like West Nile virus, spread to the brain primarily via the blood system by crossing the blood-brain barrier in what is called hematogenous dissemination.\n\nNeurotropic viruses that cause infection include Japanese Encephalitis, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis, and California encephalitis viruses; polio, coxsackie, echo, mumps, measles, influenza and rabies, as well as diseases caused by members of the family Herpesviridae such as herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, Epstein–Barr, cytomegalo and HHV-6 viruses.\n\nThose causing latent infection include herpes simplex and varicella-zoster viruses. Those causing slow virus infection include measles virus, rubella and JC viruses, and retroviruses such as human T-lymphotropic virus 1 and human immunodeficiency virus.\n\nNeurotropic viruses are increasingly being exploited as research tools, and for their potential use in treatment. In particular, they are being used to improve the understanding of the nervous systems circuits.\n\nSeveral diseases, including transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, kuru, and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease resemble a slow neurotropic virus infection—but are, in fact, caused by the infectious proteins known as prions.\n\n"}

{"id": "1316684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1316684", "title": "Power distance", "text": "Power distance\n\nPower distance is the extent to which the lower ranking individuals of a society \"accept and expect that power is distributed unequally\". It is primarily used in psychological and sociological studies on societal management of inequalities between individuals, and individual's perceptions of that management. People in societies with a high power distance are more likely to conform to a hierarchy where \"everybody has a place and which needs no further justification\". In societies with a low power distance, individuals tend to try to distribute power equally. In such societies, inequalities of power among people would require additional justification.\n\nHofstede, the famous business anthropologist, developed the cultural dimensions theory, used widely as a crucial framework for cross-cultural communication. It is the earliest theory that could be quantified and used to explain perceived differences between cultures and has been applied extensively in many fields, especially in cross-cultural psychology, international business, and cross-cultural communication. It was driven by the statistical procedure (also called 'factor analysis') to make the development, based on the result of a global survey of the values of IBM employees conducted from 1967 and 1973. Hofstede's theory identified six dimensions of culture, which are power distance, individualism vs collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs femininity, short-term vs long-term orientation, and indulgence vs self-restraint.\n\nThe Power Distance Index is designed to measure 'the extent to which power differs within the society, organization and institutions (like the family) are accepted by the less powerful members'. It indicates the level of power distance and dependent relationships in a country by assigning a score to each country. The PDI also represents society's level of inequality that is defined from below rather than from above. As Hofstede stressed, there is no absolute value and PDI is useful only as a method to compare countries.\n\nHofstede derived the power distance scores for three regions and fifty countries from the answers given by IBM employees in the same type of positions to the same questions. The detailed steps to calculate the PDI is as follows:\n\n1. Prepare three survey questions:\n2. Pre-code the answers so that they are represented by a number (e.g. 1,2,3,4...)\n\n3. Compute the mean score for the answers of equal sample of people from each country or percentage for choosing particular answers\n\n4. Sort the questions into groups which are called clusters or factors by using a statistical procedure\n\n5. Add or subtract the three scores after multiplying each with a fixed number\n\n6. Add another fixed number\n\nHofstede's study made a great contribution to the establishment of the research tradition in cross-cultural psychology. However, limitations still exist.\n\nFirstly, each stage of the research process reappears as a political act of neutralization—of making the unneutral seem neutral. The questionnaire reflects a large power distance: its questions were explicitly designed to resolve the normative concerns of researchers. To further explain, it primarily served the concerns of those who needed to do comparative analysis and created it through \"coercing a culturally distinct axis of comparison\" on a variety of employees.\n\nSecondly, the questionnaire adopted an obviously western methodology to analyze non-western countries and it is also relatively selective in representing the inequality within the western countries. For example, the PDI concentrated on the boss and subordinate relationship, which could be seen as biased, as it ignores other forms of western inequality. Apparently, the questions failed to measure the racial, colonial, and broader class inequalities which should be taken into account into the measurement of power distance.\n\nIn the middle of the last century, Haire, Ghiselli, and Porter explored the differences in preferences for power among different cultures with remarkable outcomes, even though they did not mention the concept of power distance. The methodology they adopted was by questionnaire, which was based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs with some modification. The aim of the questionnaire was to evaluate how managers from 14 countries were satisfied regarding their needs when they were in their current positions. The dimensions that were linked to power distance across cultures in their questionnaire were autonomy and self-actualization.\nAutonomy\n\nSelf-Actualization\n\nIn accordance with the responses to the questions in their questionnaire, the 14 countries were clustered into five main groups, which they labeled Nordic-European (Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Sweden), Latin-European (Belgium, France, Italy, and Spain), Anglo-American (England and the United States), Developing (Argentina, Chile, and India), and Japan (by itself). One important thing from this analysis is the various mean standardized scores that the five groups presented with respect to autonomy and self-actualization. For these figures, positive ones mean greater satisfaction of need than for the average manager across all 14 countries, while negative ones mean lesser satisfaction. Their results are presented in Table 1.\n\nUpon the figures listed in the table, some implications are drawn. They are complicated, and summarized as follows:\n– Nordic-Europeans who were surveyed were extremely contented with the satisfaction of their desire for power;\n– Anglo-Americans were rather discontented; and\n– the other clusters desired more power than they currently had in their positions\n\nOne important implication from this study is that countries can be clustered according to their preference for power. Besides this, some of their differences can be explained by the influence of the following factors: the predominant religion or philosophy, an established tradition of democracy, the long-term existence of a middle class, and the proportion of immigrants in each country.\n\nAnother major study of power distance was the one that was undertaken by Mauk Mulder. It was based on the premise that as societies become weaker in power distance, the underprivileged will tend to reject their power dependency. Mulder's laboratory experiments in the social and organizational context of the Netherlands, a low power distance culture, concluded that people attempted to seek “power distance reduction”. He found that:\n\nFrom these findings, he concluded that a condition of quasi-equilibrium had arisen. In this condition, power holders have achieved a certain distance from people who lack power, and this distance is hard for the powerless to bridge.\n\nFollowing Hofstede, the GLOBE project defined \"power distance\" as “the degree to which members of an organization or society expect and agree that power should be shared unequally.” Power distance was then further analyzed as one of the nine cultural dimensions explained in the “Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness” (GLOBE) Research Program, which was conceived in 1990 by Robert J. House of the Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania.\n\nGiven the major premise that leader effectiveness is contextual, the research was conducted by believing that the social and organizational values, norms and beliefs of those who are being led are closely connected to the effectiveness of the leader. GLOBE measures the practices and values that exist at the levels of industry (financial services, food processing, telecommunications), organization (several in each industry), and society (62 cultures). The results are presented in the form of quantitative data based on responses of about 17,000 managers from 951 organizations functioning in 62 societies throughout the world, which shows how each of the 62 societies scores on nine major attributes of cultures, including Power Distance, and six major global leader behaviour.\n\nRegarding power distance, GLOBE researches cultural influences on power distance values, practices and other aspects, including 'Roots of Power Distance', 'The Psychological Stream and Power' and 'The Cross-Cultural Stream and Power Distance'. It also investigates how family power values are taught, and makes a comparison of high versus low power distance societies.\n\nWhen discussing 'The Cross-Cultural Stream and Power Distance', four primary factors affecting a society's level of power distance are explained separately, and they are the predominant religion or philosophy, the tradition of democratic principles of government, the existence of a strong middle class, and the proportion of immigrants in a society's population. Among the four fundamental phenomena, there always exists connections; however, it is concluded that a society's main beliefs, values, and religion, will have the strongest and longest lasting influence on power distance. Then, this will be moderated by a democratic tradition and the existence of a strong middle class to some extent. Moreover, the two factors are both expected to affect narrowing power distance. Therefore, for a Roman Catholic society, which is exposed to democracy and a middle class, would be on the way to narrowing power distance. Though its level of power distance could be reduced over time, it would still be higher than a Protestant country, which has a democratic tradition and a large middle class. Finally, a large proportion of immigrants in a given society makes the low power distance trend stronger in all circumstances presented above. In addition, it is concluded that regardless of religion, any society that does not have a tradition of democracy or a significant middle class will have a substantially high power distance levels.\n\nPower distance is such a significant dimension in cross-cultural environments that it is unconsciously influencing people's behaviour in different countries, which contributes to so–called 'cultural norms'. These 'cultural norms', shaped by perceptions and acceptance of power inequality to a certain degree, lead to various reactions when facing same situations or in the same environment. However, there are some consequences resulting from acquiescence in inequality in organizations and societies, especially for high power distance countries.\n\nIn organisations with high power distance, employees acknowledge their lesser standing, and are respectful and submissive towards their superiors; who in turn, are more likely to give orders rather than consult with their employees while making decisions. Status symbols are often displayed and flaunted. Employers or managers would not have meals together with their subordinates, and might have private facilities such as rooms, parking lots, and elevators. Having a high level of education is important to climb the corporate ladder, and the higher-ranking members of the organization are often paid much more than their employees in comparison with companies with lower power distance.\n\nOn the other hand, in businesses with low power distance, bosses are not as concerned with status symbols and would be more open to employee discussion and participation. Employees are less submissive to their superiors, and are more likely to make themselves heard or to challenge the management.\n\nIn high power distance regions, people in the higher positions hold great amounts of power with little challenge. The hierarchy and authority empower employers and supervisors with more rights of resource allocation, rewards and punishment, which in turn reinforce their status, as well as enable them to lead and guide their subordinates autocratically. The hierarchical differentiation between the top and the bottom gradually creates an invisible gap in the workplace, where the subordinates tend to build greater sensitivity and cautiousness when communicating with their supervisors.\n\nIt is a common phenomenon that junior employees turn to their seniors for help and advice when getting into a new environment. Yet, some researchers recently attested that employees and junior staff from high power distance countries are less likely to seek help from their supervisors. One of the reasons is that lower ranking staff have few chances and time to meet the high ranking managers in person. The hierarchical system is far more sophisticated and restricted that subordinates are usually only able to reach their immediate supervisors. In addition, it is widely believed that the action of asking for help is equivalent to incompetence or lack of ability, which subdues themselves into an unfavourable circumstance. What is worse is that some of the supervisors who are incapable of solving more complicated problems will become suspicious of his or her subordinates, regarding the problems as a challenge to their status and capabilities, or even as humiliation from the lower ranking staff. Such climates have gradually reinforced employees to think that it is more effective and efficient to deal with difficulties by themselves, rather than talking to their managers. The indisputability of power and authority widens the gap between different levels, while the acceptance of inequality consolidates the endurance among the bottom, stopping the subordinates seeking help from the top.\n\nThere is another main perspective that leads to a larger gap between the supervisors and subordinates. In a high power distance environment, supervisors tend to pay more attention on tasks rather than human beings that are the main focus for supervisors in a low power distance environment. Apparently, task orientation emphasizes heavily on daily work completion and performance efficiency, yet the top-bottom relationship grows far more slowly since there is a lack of communication beyond work, which in turn reduces subordinates' willingness of seeking help from supervisors. Compared to low power distance countries, equality is embraced by the society that power is minimized to a large extent, where authority and hierarchy are not highlighted and supervisors are accessible and willing to build close relationship with subordinates, whose worries of any harm are turned down when seeking help from the top.\n\nAccording to research, people from high power distance countries are generally less responsible towards charitable behaviours than people from low power distance countries. The explanation for this phenomenon is that the rooted perception and acceptance of inequality somehow blinds their eyes to any unfair or inappropriate situations, which they may consider as a normal social circumstance and simply accept it rather than making a change. Cumulatively, the more inequality they accept, the less inconformity they will notice, and the less responsibilities they will take eventually. The consequence is high power distance enlarging the gap between human beings in terms of relations and wealth conditions. Conversely, people in low power distance countries are more sensitive towards any unequal phenomena. Their unacceptance of dissonance endows them with a greater sense of responsibility for adjusting or correcting the problems in person.\n\nThe types of needs are influencing people's charitable behaviour regardless of their power distance backgrounds. The needs generated are classified into controllable and uncontrollable categories, where the occurrence of the former is due to lack of effort while the occurrence of the latter is due to unforeseeable events such as natural disasters. The ability of whether individuals are able to control the situations affects how they will react to the raising needs.\n\nOn the one hand, the level of power distance does have an influence over a society's reaction towards controllable needs. People with high power distance background perceive most of the issues as rightful inequality, hence are reluctant to get themselves involved with 'troubles', and therefore most of the time they choose to turn a blind eye on such petty things. Conversely, low power distance societies are intolerant with unfairness and thus their higher sense of responsibility motivates people to make an effort in eliminating dissonance in every possibility. Yet, there seems to be an exception. It is found that people are not sympathetic at all to those in trouble due to internal-controllable reasons. In other words, it is most likely that people reckon those who are lazy, careless, greedy or indulgent, deserve such hardship and punishment, instead of giving a hand to them to go through the difficulties. In this situation, even if there is an evident unequal phenomenon emerging, the willingness of charitable behaviours are attenuated to the least in both high and low power distance countries.\n\nOn the other hand, people tend to be more responsible in terms of uncontrollable needs, whereby they are more willing to offer aid to. It is assumed that people consider that the aid for uncontrollable needs will not greatly change societal rightful inequality, and hence generous assistance and help will be offered to those in need regardless of power distance background. In such circumstances, a sense of duty is more likely to be raised, where people tend to undertake charitable behaviours.\n\nThe relationship norms behind the needs also affect the sense of responsibility. The types of relationships are mainly classified as exchange relationships, in which people are expecting a reasonable privilege or benefit in return for offering aid; and communal relationships, where those giving assistance are wholeheartedly and generously taking care of those in need without any expectation of material return. According to research, people are more likely to refuse to aid when encountering needs associated with exchange relationships rather than needs with communal relationships, which has proved to alleviate the influence of power distance belief and increase the willingness and responsibility of assistance.\n\nTherefore, Winterich recommended that charitable organizations in high power distance countries should stress the significance of uncontrollable needs or salient communal relationship norms, through which the populace are more easily motivated to make a difference on social inequality.\n\nMalaysia has one of the highest levels of power distance, with a score of 100 on Hofstede's Power Distance Index (PDI). This signifies that Malaysians would generally consent to, and not question, hierarchies in which everyone has a place. They would perceive hierarchy in organisations as mirroring intrinsic inequalities. Leaders are expected to be autocratic, and to instruct their subordinates on what to do. Malaysian society is often centralised, and opposition to authority is generally not welcomed.\n\nWith a PDI score of 11, Austria is one of the countries with the lowest levels of power distance. Austrians believe in independence, equal rights, approachable leaders, that chain of command should only be for convenience, and that supervision should facilitate and empower. Power is typically decentralised, with leaders often consulting or relying on their subordinates. First names are usually used even with superiors, and communication is direct and two-way.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that there is a link between climate and power distance, with societies in warmer climates more likely to have a higher power distance than societies in colder climates. As food and other necessities are relatively easier to come by in warm, comfortable climates, survival is not as difficult, and thus there is no need for rigorous discipline, preparation, or hardship. It has been argued that these conditions would give rise to a situation whereby it is beneficial for strict organisation and direction to come from superiors in order to propel people to cooperate effectively, even if it goes against the will of some people.\n\nOn the other hand, in colder, harsher climates, it is imperative for individuals to have discipline and prudence to work hard and make the right decisions in order to survive. In these societies, if one were to be lazy and rest for a day instead of searching for food, they might not be able to survive. Therefore, self-discipline and restraint is paramount in these climates. With these qualities ingrained in the people, social order does not need to be enforced externally.\n\nIt has been asserted that democratic governments occur most commonly among low power distance societies, where it is not ingrained into the minds of the people since young age that there are unquestionable hierarchies in life that should not be disputed. It has been found that the 'ideological breach between labour and conservatives' is exceedingly polarised in high power distance socieites, while in low power distance cultures, people would tend to try to attain balance between the two extremes in order to avoid damaging and draining conflicts. This is why unions in high power distance cultures are usually formed by corporations or governments, while those in lower power distance societies are usually less 'ideological' and more 'practical'.\n\n"}

He is depicted as a thin, unnaturally tall humanoid with a featureless head and face and wearing a black suit.\n\nStories of the Slender Man commonly feature him stalking, abducting or traumatizing people, particularly children. The Slender Man is not confined to a single narrative but appears in many disparate works of fiction, typically composed online. Fiction relating to the Slender Man encompasses many media, including literature, art and video series such as \"Marble Hornets\", wherein he is known as The Operator. Outside of online fiction, the Slender Man has become an internet icon and has influenced popular culture, having been referenced in the video game \"Minecraft\" with the Enderman character and generated video games of his own, such as \"\" and \"\". He has also appeared in a , where he was portrayed by Doug Jones, and an eponymous film, where he was portrayed by Javier Botet.\n\nBeginning in 2014, a moral panic occurred over the Slender Man after readers of his fiction were connected to several violent acts, particularly a near-fatal stabbing of a 12-year-old girl in Waukesha, Wisconsin.\n\nThe Slender Man was created on June 10, 2009, on a thread in the Something Awful Internet forum. The thread was a Photoshop contest in which users were challenged to \"create paranormal images.\" Forum poster Eric Knudsen, under the pseudonym \"Victor Surge\", contributed two black-and-white images of groups of children to which he added a tall, thin, spectral figure wearing a black suit. Although previous entries had consisted solely of photographs, Surge supplemented his submission with snatches of text—supposedly from witnesses—describing the abductions of the groups of children and giving the character the name \"The Slender Man\":\n\nThe quote under the first photograph read:\n\nThe quote under the second photograph read:\nThese additions effectively transformed the photographs into a work of fiction. Subsequent posters expanded upon the character, adding their own visual or textual contributions.\n\nKnudsen was inspired to create the Slender Man primarily by Zack Parsons' \"That Insidious Beast\", Stephen King's \"The Mist\", reports of shadow people, Mothman and the Mad Gasser of Mattoon. Other inspirations for the character were the Tall Man from the 1979 film \"Phantasm\", H. P. Lovecraft, the surrealist work of William S. Burroughs, and the survival horror video games \"Silent Hill\" and \"Resident Evil\". Knudsen's intention was \"to formulate something whose motivations can barely be comprehended, and [which caused] unease and terror in a general population.\" Other pre-existing fictional or legendary creatures which are similar to the Slender Man include: the Gentlemen, black-suited, pale, bald demons from the \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" episode \"Hush\"; Men in black, many accounts of which grant them an uncanny appearance with an unnatural walk and \"oriental\" features; and The Question, a DC Comics superhero with a blank face, whose secret identity is \"Victor Sage\", a name similar to Knudsen's alias \"Victor Surge\".\n\nIn her book, \"Folklore, Horror Stories, and the Slender Man: The Development of an Internet Mythology\", Professor Shira Chess of the University of Georgia connected the Slender Man to ancient folklore about fairies. Like fairies, Slender Man is otherworldly, with motives that are often difficult to grasp; like fairies, his appearance is vague and often shifts to reflect what the viewer wants or fears to see, and, like fairies, the Slender Man calls the woods and wild places his home and kidnaps children.\n\nThe Slender Man soon went viral, spawning numerous works of fanart, cosplay, and online fiction known as \"creepypasta\"—scary stories told in short snatches of easily copyable text that spread from site to site. Divorced from its original creator, the Slender Man became the subject of myriad stories by multiple authors within an overarching mythos.\n\nMany aspects of the Slender Man mythos first appeared on the original Something Awful thread. One of the earliest additions was added by a forum user named \"Thoreau-Up\", who created a folklore story set in 16th-century Germany involving a character called Der Groẞman, which was implied to be an early reference to the Slender Man. The first video series involving the Slender Man evolved from a post on the Something Awful thread by user \"ce gars\". It tells of a fictional film school friend named Alex Kralie, who had stumbled upon something troubling while shooting his first feature-length project, \"Marble Hornets\". The video series, published in found footage style on YouTube, forms an alternate reality game describing the filmers' fictional experiences with the Slender Man. The ARG also incorporates a Twitter feed and an alternate YouTube channel created by a user named \"totheark\". As of 2013, \"Marble Hornets\" had over 250,000 subscribers around the world and had received 55 million views. Other Slender Man-themed YouTube serials followed, including \"EverymanHYBRID\" and \"TribeTwelve\".\n\nIn 2012, the Slender Man was adapted into a video game titled \"\"; within its first month of release, the game was downloaded over 2 million times. Several popular variants of the game followed, including \"Slenderman's Shadow\" and \"Slender Man\" for iOS, which became the second most-popular app download. The sequel to \"Slender: The Eight Pages\", \"\", was released in 2013. Several independent films about the Slender Man have been released or are in development, including \"Entity\" and \"The Slender Man\", released free online after a $10,000 Kickstarter campaign. In 2013, it was announced that \"Marble Hornets\" would become a feature film. In 2015, the film adaptation, \"\", was released on VOD, where the character was portrayed by Doug Jones. In 2016, Sony Pictures subsidiary Screen Gems partnered with Mythology Entertainment to bring a Slender Man film into theatres, with the title character portrayed by Javier Botet.\n\nBecause the Slender Man's fictional \"mythology\" has evolved without an official \"canon\" for reference, his appearance, motives, habits, and abilities are not fixed but change depending on the storyteller. He is most commonly described as very tall and thin with unnaturally long, tentacle-like arms (or merely tentacles), which he can extend to intimidate or capture prey. In most stories his face is white and featureless, but occasionally his face appears differently to anyone who sees it. He appears to be wearing a dark suit and tie. The Slender Man is often associated with the forest and/or abandoned locations and has the ability to teleport. Proximity to the Slender Man is often said to trigger a \"Slender sickness\"; a rapid onset of paranoia, nightmares and delusions accompanied by nosebleeds.\n\nEarly stories featured him targeting children or young adults. Some featured young adults driven insane or to act on his behalf, while others did not, and others claim that investigating the Slender Man will draw his attention. The web series \"Marble Hornets\" established the idea of proxies (humans who fall under the Slender Man's influence) though initially they were simply violently insane, rather than puppets of the Slender Man. \"Marble Hornets\" also introduced the idea that the Slender Man could interfere with video and audio recordings, as well as the \"Slender Man symbol\", which became a common trope of Slender fiction. Graphic violence and body horror are uncommon in the Slender Man mythos, with many narratives choosing to leave the fate of his victims obscure. Shira Chess notes that \"It is important to note that few of the retellings identify exactly what kind of monster the Slender Man might be, and what his specific intentions are- these points all remain mysteriously and usefully vague.\"\n\nSeveral scholars have argued that, despite being a fictional work with an identifiable origin point, the Slender Man represents a form of digital folklore. \nShira Chess argues that the Slender Man exemplifies the similarities between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, the fact that the Slender Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form. Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his/her audience).\n\nAndrew Peck also considers the Slender Man to be an authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity despite the lack of a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.\n\nJeff Tolbert also accepts the Slender Man as folkloric and suggests it represents a process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics is the process of acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).\n\nProfessor Thomas Pettitt of the University of Southern Denmark has described the Slender Man as being an exemplar of the modern age's closing of the \"Gutenberg Parenthesis\"; the time period from the invention of the printing press to the spread of the web in which stories and information were codified in discrete media, to a return to the older, more primal forms of storytelling, exemplified by oral tradition and campfire tales, in which the same story can be retold, reinterpreted and recast by different tellers, expanding and evolving with time.\n\nMedia scholar and folklorist Andrew Peck attributes the success of the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.\n\nAlthough nearly all users understand that the Slender Man is not real, they suspend that disbelief in order to become more engrossed when telling or listening to stories. This adds a sense of authenticity to Slender Man legend performances and blurs the lines between legend and reality, keeping the creature as an object of legend dialectic. This ambiguity has led some to some confusion over the character's origin and purpose. Only five months after his creation, George Noory's \"Coast to Coast AM\", a radio call-in show devoted to the paranormal and conspiracy theories, began receiving callers asking about the Slender Man. Two years later, an article in the \"Minneapolis Star Tribune\" described his origins as \"difficult to pinpoint.\" Eric Knudsen has commented that many people, despite understanding that the Slender Man was created on the Something Awful forums, still entertain the possibility that he might be real.\n\nShira Chess describes the Slender Man as a metaphor for \"helplessness, power differentials, and anonymous forces.\" Peck sees parallels between the Slender Man and common anxieties about the digital age, such as feelings of constant connectedness and unknown third-party observation. Similarly, Tye Van Horn, a writer for \"The Elm\", has suggested that the Slender Man represents modern fear of the unknown; in an age flooded with information, people have become so unaccustomed to ignorance that they now fear what they cannot understand. Troy Wagner, the creator of \"Marble Hornets\", ascribes the terror of the Slender Man to its malleability; people can shape it into whatever frightens them most. Tina Marie Boyer noted that \"The Slender man is a prohibitive monster, but the cultural boundaries he guards are not clear. Victims do not know when they have violated or crossed them.\"\n\nDespite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man is not in the public domain. Several for-profit ventures involving the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television. The identity of this option holder has not been made public. Knudsen himself has argued that his enforcement of copyright has less to do with money than with artistic integrity: \"I just want something amazing to come off it... something that's scary and disturbing and kinda different. I would hate for something to come out and just be kinda conventional.\" As of May 2016, the media rights to Slender Man have been sold to production company Mythology Entertainment.\n\nOn May 31, 2014, two 12-year-old girls in Waukesha, Wisconsin held down and stabbed a 12-year-old classmate 19 times. When questioned later by authorities, they reportedly claimed that they wished to commit a murder as a first step to becoming proxies for the Slender Man, having read about it online. They also stated that they were afraid that Slender Man would kill their families if they did not commit the murder. After the perpetrators left the scene, the victim crawled out of the woods to a roadway. A passing cyclist alerted authorities, and the victim survived the attack. Both attackers have been diagnosed with mental illnesses but have also been charged as adults and are each facing up to 65 years in prison. One of the girls reportedly said Slender Man watches her, can read minds, and could teleport.\n\nExperts testified in court that she also said she conversed with Lord Voldemort and one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her prosecution was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that she knew what she was doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital. On December 21, Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren sentenced Weier, then 16 years-old, to be hospitalized for 25 years from the date of the crime, which would keep her institutionalized until age 37.\n\nIn a statement to the media, Eric Knudsen said, \"I am deeply saddened by the tragedy in Wisconsin and my heart goes out to the families of those affected by this terrible act.\" He stated he would not be giving interviews on the matter.\n\nOn 25 September 2017, it was reported that Morgan Geyser, then 15, had agreed to plead guilty to attempting to commit first-degree homicide in an arrangement that would allow her avoid jail time. In terms of the arrangement Geyser would remain at the mental hospital where she had been staying for the past two years for at least a further three years.\n\nOn February 1, 2018, the Associated Press reported that Geyser had been sentenced to 40 years in the Wisconsin mental hospital, the maximum sentence allowed.\n\nA documentary film on the incident called \"Beware the Slenderman\" was released by HBO Films in March 2016, and was broadcast on HBO on January 23, 2017.\n\nAfter hearing the story, an unidentified woman from Cincinnati, Ohio, told a WLWT TV reporter in June 2014 that her 13-year-old daughter had attacked her with a knife, and had written macabre fiction, some involving the Slender Man, who the mother said motivated the attack.\n\nOn September 4, 2014, a 14-year-old girl in Port Richey, Florida, allegedly set her family's house on fire while her mother and nine-year-old brother were inside. Police reported that the teenager had been reading online stories about Slender Man as well as Atsushi Ōkubo's manga \"Soul Eater\". Eddie Daniels of the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said the girl \"had visited the website that contains a lot of the Slender Man information and stories [...] It would be safe to say there is a connection to that.\"\n\nDuring an early 2015 epidemic of suicide attempts by young people ages 12 to 24 on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Slender Man was cited as an influence; the Oglala Sioux tribe president noted that many Native Americans traditionally believe in a \"suicide spirit\" similar to the Slender Man.\n\n\n\n"}

On her 1984 mission she became the first woman to fly to space twice, and the first woman to perform a spacewalk. She set several FAI world records as a pilot.\n\nSvetlana Savitskaya was born in a privileged family. Her father, Yevgeniy Savitskiy, was a highly decorated fighter pilot during the Second World War, which later brought him to the position of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Air Defense.\n\nWithout the knowledge of her parents, Savitskaya began parachuting at the age of 16. When her father heard about it, he further promoted this tendency. On her seventeenth birthday she already had 450 parachute jumps. Over the next year, she led record stratosphere jumps from 13,800 m and 14,250 m.\n\nAfter graduating in 1966, she enrolled in the Moscow State Aviation Institute (MAI), where she also took flight lessons. In 1971 she was licensed as a flight instructor. After graduating from the MAI in 1972, she trained as a test pilot at the Fedotov Test Pilot School, graduating in 1976. In May 1978 she went to work for the aircraft manufacturer Yakovlev, as a test pilot.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1977 she was a member of the Soviet national team for aerobatics. At the FAI World Aerobatic Championships in July 1970 at Hullavington, she flew a Yak-18 and won the world championship together with an all-female team. At the 1972 World Championships in Salon-de-Provence she placed third; in 1976 in Kiev with a Yak-50, fifth.\n\nIn 1979, Savitskaya participated in the selection process for the second group of female cosmonauts. On June 30, 1980, she was officially admitted to the cosmonaut group. She passed her exams on February 24, 1982.\n\nIn December 1981, Savitskaya prepared for her first space flight, a short-term flight to the space station Salyut 7, replacing the original crew. The commander of this mission was Leonid Popov, with his third flight; it was flight engineer Alexander Serebrov's first flight.\n\nThe launch of Soyuz T-7 took place on August 19, 1982. This made Savitskaya the second woman in space, 19 years after Valentina Tereshkova. The three cosmonauts docked with the space station the following day, where they were welcomed by Anatoly Berezovoy and Valentin Lebedev. This was the first time a space station had a mixed gender crew. Savitskaya was assigned the orbital module of Soyuz T-7 as a private area, but slept as well as the men in the space station. On August 27, 1982, Popov, Savitskaya, and Serebrov returned to Earth in Soyuz T-5.\n\nIn 1995, Savitskaya gave an interview to Baltimore Sun journalist Clara Germani. She recalled encountering some sexism from her male crewmates and that upon entering Salyut 7 for the first time, Valentin Lebedev presented her with an apron and told her \"to get to work\". She stated that \"I was quickly able to establish a working, professional relationship with them.\"\n\nIn December 1983 she was assigned to her second flight, including an EVA, three weeks after American astronaut Kathy Sullivan's flight and EVA assignment were made public. Again, it was to be a short-term mission to Salyut 7, this time bringing tools to the station so that the third resident crew, the Salyut 7 EO-3, could repair a fuel line.\n\nOn July 17, 1984 Savitskaya launched aboard Soyuz T-12, together with Commander Vladimir Dzhanibekov and research cosmonaut Igor Volk. On July 25, 1984, Savitskaya became the first woman to spacewalk, conducting EVA outside the Salyut 7 space station for 3 hours and 35 minutes, during which she cut and welded metals in space along with her colleague Vladimir Dzhanibekov. Of the 57 Soviet/Russian spacewalkers through 2010, she is the only woman. The return to earth took place on July 29, 1984.\n\nSavitskaya recalled that, during her second mission, she expressed concern about the extravehicular welding exercises, as \"I did not understand the point of it. We might burn our spacesuits or the exterior of the station.\" but her overall excellent performance on both flights silenced critics who questioned a woman's capability to perform space missions.\n\nUpon returning to Earth, Savitskaya was assigned as the commander of an all-female Soyuz crew to Salyut 7 in commemoration of International Women's Day. In February 1985, however, the radio contact with Salyut 7 was lost; the space station was rescued by the Soyuz T-13 mission in the summer of 1985. When the next mission had to be stopped in November 1985, due to an illness of the commander Vasyutin, the women's flight was finally canceled. In addition, after two unsuccessful flights in 1983, Soyuz T-8 and Soyuz T-10-1, not enough Soyuz spacecraft were available. Later it would have been possible to fly with a Soyuz-TM to the space station Mir. However, this plan was not pursued due to Savitskaya's pregnancy in 1986.\n\nSavitskaya is married, with one child, a son born in 1986. In February 1986, she graduated from the Moscow State Technical University Bauman. From 1983 to 1994 Savitskaya held a position of Deputy Head of NPO Energia.\n\nA committed communist, Savitskaya was elected as a people's deputy of the USSR from 1989 and a people's deputy of Russia in 1990, a position she held until 1992. She did not welcome the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, noting that everything her parents had worked hard to build was destroyed almost overnight and she was \"glad they did not live to see it\".\n\nSavitskaya retired in 1993 from the Russian Air Force with the rank of Major. In 1994/95 she worked as an Assistant Professor in Economics and Investment at the Moscow State Aviation Institute. In 1996, she was elected a deputy of the State Duma representing the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and has been re-elected four times since then. She presently serves as Deputy Chair of the Committee on Defence, and is also a member of the Coordination council presidium of the National Patriotic Union.\n\n\nSavitskaya was one of five cosmonauts selected to raise the Russian flag at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony.\n\nThe asteroid 4118 Sveta is named after her.\n\n\n"}

An updated revision, The American Way of Death Revisited, completed by Mitford just before her death in 1996, appeared in 1998.\n\nMitford's husband, civil rights lawyer Robert Treuhaft, persuaded her to write an investigative article about the American funeral industry. Though her article on the subject, \"Saint Peter Don't You Call Me\" published in \"Frontier\" magazine, was not widely disseminated, it caught considerable attention when Mitford appeared on a local television broadcast with two industry representatives. Convinced of public interest, she wrote \"The American Way of Death\", which was published in 1963. In the book Mitford harshly criticized the industry for using unscrupulous business practices to take advantage of grieving families.\n\nFeeling that death had become much too sentimentalized, highly commercialized, and, above all, excessively expensive, Mitford published her research, which, she argues, documents the ways in which funeral directors take advantage of the shock and grief of friends and relatives of loved ones to convince them to pay far more than necessary for the funeral and other services, such as availability of so-called \"grief counselors,\" a title she claims is unmerited. The book became a major bestseller and led to Congressional hearings on the funeral industry. It was one of the inspirations for filmmaker Tony Richardson's 1965 film \"The Loved One\", which was based on Evelyn Waugh's short satirical 1948 novel of the same name, tellingly subtitled \"An Anglo-American Tragedy\".\n\nIn keeping with her wishes, Mitford herself had an inexpensive funeral, which cost $533.31 – she was cremated without a ceremony, and the ashes scattered at sea; the cremation itself cost $475. The funeral company was the Pacific Interment Service, which prides itself on \"dignity, simplicity, affordability\".\n\nJudith Newman in the \"New York Times Book Review\" commented, \"This revised and updated version of her book is no less startling, or entertaining, than the original was,\" and also notes that Mitford \"is also prescient in predicting the rise of bottom-line-above-all corporate funeral home chains like Service Corporation International and the Loewen Group, which, as Mitford reports, are now consolidating (read: devouring) mom-and-pop operations.\"\n\nBess Lovejoy of \"Lapham's Quarterly\" wrote in an extended review of the 1998 updated revision, \"The book is a narrowly conceived exposé, a screed against expensive funerals and the men who sell them, not an analysis of how or why funerals got that way. It’s interesting to contrast Mitford’s book with the seminal death texts of the past, such as the two in the fifteenth century that were both called The Art of Dying, or the Tibetan and Egyptian books of the dead. Those works helped individuals prepare for death by prescribing a series of attitudes and rituals designed to ensure a good death and a better afterlife. Such rituals helped people grapple with death’s great challenge to the self; they made death mean. By contrast, Mitford’s book is a Consumer Reports of death.\"\n"}

The program focuses on the mystery of the Permian extinction, which scientists believe killed over 90% of all life on earth at the end of the Permian, some 250 million years ago. The program features scientists like Adrian Jones, Vincent Courtillot, Gregory Retallack, Peter Ward, Michael Benton, Michael R. Rampino and others.\n\nThe program features palaeontologists and other scientists as they try to find clues to the great extinction. In the program, it is argued that the Permian extinction came in 3 stages; the first was caused by volcanic activity in the great Siberian Traps. This is proposed to have caused global warming, which in turn killed much of the life on land. Second, it warmed up the sea, which killed much of the marine life. As the sea became warmer, the ocean floor released a massive amount of methane. As the methane reached the atmosphere, the earth became even warmer, which led to the extinction of even more lifeforms on land. In the program, the extinction is argued to have lasted less than 1 million years.\n\n"}
{"id": "8410468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8410468", "title": "Tory Foster", "text": "Tory Foster\n\nTory Foster is a fictional character from the 2004 TV series \"Battlestar Galactica\", portrayed by Rekha Sharma.\n\nTory, like the other members of the Final Five, was originally from a planet called Earth. This Earth had been colonized by the 13th Tribe (composed of Cylons from the planet Kobol) roughly 4,000 years before the events of the series (c.152,000 BC as revealed by the final episode). Tory and Galen Tyrol were in a relationship in their past lives - they lived together and planned to get married. Tory and the other members of the group that would later be known as the Final Five were working to recreate the resurrection process their Cylon ancestors used to employ on Kobol, a process that had fallen out of favor on Earth due to procreation. They had some advance knowledge of the impending destruction due to warnings from people no one else could see. The messenger that appeared to Tory looked like a man. When Earth was destroyed roughly 2,000 years ago the Final Five arranged to have themselves resurrected aboard a sub-light ship orbiting earth. They then left to find the Twelve Colonies and warn them about treating their artificial life with respect or face the same doom that befell Earth. By the time the Final Five completed their sublight journey thousands of years had passed, and they arrived near the end of the first Cylon/human war. Meeting the Cylon centurions, the Five offered to show them how to create humanoid cylon models in exchange for the centurions ending the war. The Final Five created eight models. However, the first model (John Cavil) destroyed the seventh model (Daniel) out of fraternal envy. Cavil then killed the Final Five and boxed their minds for years, later resurrecting them in new bodies and reprogramming them to think they were humans from the Twelve Colonies. Presumably, he also reprogrammed the other Cylon models to not think about the Final Five or investigate their identities, and that to do so would constitute heresy.\n\nIn her new life, before the Destruction of the Twelve Colonies, Tory was a precinct captain for the Federalist Party in Delphi on Caprica for five years. In this capacity, she became an expert on polling. During the nuclear attack on the Colonies she was driving down a road on Caprica and got hit by the force of a nuclear shockwave. Her car was destroyed and she was injured, but she managed to survive the shockwave and was presumably picked up by a Raptor that landed nearby looking for survivors.\n\nFollowing the death of Billy Keikeya, Tory Foster becomes one of President Laura Roslin's chief aides and advisors. She takes a particular responsibility for managing Roslin's election campaign. One of her first moves is to take an opinion poll, the results of which clearly show Roslin leading her presumptive opponent, Tom Zarek. She plays a part in finding a human foster mother for the half-Cylon child Hera Agathon and is one of the few people who know the child is alive. She counsels Roslin during the Rya Kibby case, as she weighs up the consequences of appeasing the pro-life beliefs of the Gemenese and the need to repopulate the human race versus the individual rights and freedoms guaranteed under Colonial law before the attack.\n\nAfter Roslin's executive order criminalizes abortion throughout the fleet, Vice-President Gaius Baltar announces his candidacy in the forthcoming election, and garners Zarek's support as campaign manager (and eventual Vice-President). The discovery of New Caprica and the Baltar-Zarek campaign's pro-settlement position swings much popular support away from Roslin. With Roslin's at first tacit, and later explicit, approval, Foster conspires with Colonel Saul Tigh and others to rig the election in Roslin's favour. The deception is discovered by Lieutenant Felix Gaeta on account of a typographical mistake on one set of ballot papers, and Baltar is sworn in as Roslin's successor.\n\nDuring the occupation of New Caprica by the Cylons, Foster joins the human resistance movement, again serving as Laura Roslin's aide. She works to compile a list of known Cylon collaborators among the human population. She helps to organize the swift and orderly evacuation of the civilian population to their assigned vessels, and is one of the last people to see Maya and her adopted daughter Hera/Isis as the evacuation takes place. Despite having two bodyguards, Maya does not make it off New Caprica, Hera is captured by Number Three, and Foster personally apologizes to Roslin for what she sees as her failure.\n\nFollowing Roslin's second inauguration as President of the Twelve Colonies, Foster resumes her former duties as a presidential aide.\n\nIn the last few episodes of season 3, her mental condition starts deteriorating, and she starts hearing music. In the cliffhanger Season 3 finale, \"Crossroads, Part II\", she, along with Samuel Anders, Saul Tigh, and Galen Tyrol become aware of the fact they are Cylons, based on hallucinatory music (which turns out to be \"All Along The Watchtower,\" as performed by Bear McCreary's brother ) only they can hear, and a \"switch\" that goes off within them (as Chief Tyrol mentions). Foster and Anders have experienced at least the beginnings of a physical relationship. As the Cylon fleet attacked, Tigh defiantly declared \"Whatever else I am, I'm an officer in the Colonial Fleet and if I die today, that's the man I'll be.\" Following this speech, Foster reported to the CIC to aid President Roslin.\n\nSeason 4 opens with Tory Foster continuing her participation in clandestine final-four Cylon meetings (Anders, Foster, Tigh, Tyrol). Tigh suggests Gaius Baltar as a potential source of information, citing Baltar's previous time spent among the Cylons; Foster attempts to gain Gaius' confidence via professed admiration and seduction. Despite her initial objection to actual sexual relations, she has sex with Baltar during which she weeps. When Baltar asks why she is crying, she says it's just something she does, and things could be worse: she could be a Cylon. Baltar tells her he believes Cylons can feel, and, touched, she stops crying and kisses him in earnest. Subsequently, she seems to be spending more and more time with Baltar, not necessarily just to gain information. In \"Escape Velocity,\" she attends one of Baltar's monotheism rallies, and appears to be approving.\n\nWhen she discovers Cally Tyrol has overheard one of the clandestine meetings, she follows her to a Viper launch tube, dissuades Cally from killing herself and her son, and secures the infant, but Foster then ejects the mother out the tube herself. Foster shows no guilt. She appears to have embraced both being a Cylon and her own version of Baltar's teachings, allowing her to by-pass such feelings and adopt an almost hedonistic approach to life. She declares herself to be \"perfect\", something that disturbs fellow Cylons Tigh and Tyrol, and is in marked contrast to Tigh's and Caprica Six's guilty consciences (Escape Velocity).\n\nLater, Foster meets with President Roslin, who first pleasantly comments about Foster's positive change in mood any time she is aboard Galactica. Roslin asks Foster to find out who was sharing the rumors of the president's shared visions to Baltar, then sticks the dagger in, telling Foster she is very aware that she is sleeping with Gaius Baltar. Before Foster can say a word, Roslin tells her there are enough reports of her visitations to \"make her a charter member of his nymph squad.\" Foster confesses to believing in Baltar's spiritual message, but Roslin is feeling quite betrayed and turns her back on her to do other work, ordering her away (Guess What's Coming to Dinner?).\n\nOut of the known members of the Final Five, Tory seems to be embracing her Cylon-self more than the others. The other three are attempting to maintain their human selves (the same way that Boomer did). This results in a change to her personality.\n\nAfter Downloaded Three is unboxed, now knowing the identities of the Final Five, and brought to Galactica, Foster stays true her earlier affinity for her Cylon side. Under the pretence of bringing Laura Roslin her medication, she flies to the Cylon basestar, where she is introduced to her fellow Cylons and tells Roslin and Baltar about her true nature. During the ensuing stand off between Three and Galactica over the remaining three Cylons, she helps Three's cause by informing her of Lee Adama's perceived weaknesses (Revelations).\n\nWhen the fleet arrives at Earth and discovers it is a barren world destroyed by a nuclear catastrophe and once populated by Cylons, Foster and her fellow Final Five Cylons begin remembering details about their past lives on the planet. One detail she clearly remembers is how Anders used to be a musician and used to play a song he wrote for her and their friends, Galen Tyrol and Saul and Ellen Tigh. She and Tyrol were also lovers at the time (No Exit).\n\nSince being publicly identified as a member of the Final Five Cylons, Foster has taken up full-time residence on board the rebel basestar, living with the Twos, Sixes (less Caprica-Six), and Eights (less Sharon Agathon & Sharon Valerii). Her fellow Cylons appear to have also given her equal status in their command hierarchy, as evident by her behaviour during Gaeta's Mutiny. When Laura Roslin is smuggled aboard the basestar, Foster is content to abandon the fleet to its own turmoil and simply jump away to safety, a notion her fellow Cylons support. Though she repeatedly argues against involving the basestar in the counter-coup efforts, she ultimately concedes to Roslin's plan (Blood on the Scales).\n\nDuring Gaeta's mutiny Sam Anders is shot in the back of the skull. When he regains consciousness he remembers his and the others former life on Earth and after. He recites the history as fast as he could to the other Final Five, including Tory Foster. Like the other Fives, she was a scientist attempting to reinvent resurrection technology. To her and Galen Tyrol's mutual shock she learned they were once lived together as lovers and were engaged to be married. (No Exit)\n\nAfter Anders's apparently unsuccessful (in that he never regained consciousness) surgery and his comatose state, Foster urges the other Finals and Caprica Six to leave for the Baseship and abandon the fleet in order to strike out on their own without humanity. Then Ellen Tigh, the Fifth Final, arrives after apparently being rescued from Cavil by Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii. The Final Five debate the merits of staying with the fleet versus leaving. When the matter is put to a vote, Tyrol and Foster vote to leave and Tigh votes to stay. Though Anders is in a coma during this debate, Tyrol reminds the others Anders had previously pleaded with Colonel Tigh to stay with the fleet, and they agree to count Anders's vote thusly. This means the vote is a 2-2 deadlock with Ellen Tigh holding the deciding vote. Ellen is conflicted and postpones her decision, as she is upset by her discovery of the relationship between Saul Tigh and Caprica Six. Later, driven by jealousy, resentment and anger over Saul Tigh conceiving a child with Caprica Six and the implication he loved Caprica Six more than he ever did Ellen, Ellen makes her decision and votes with Foster and Tyrol to leave humanity. However Caprica Six's miscarriage, possibly brought on by stress caused by an attack in Dogsville and personal confrontations with Ellen Tigh over the true love of Saul Tigh, changes the situation. Foster and the others reluctantly decide to stay, since the loss of Caprica Six's pregnancy means Hera Agathon has become the only remaining hope of Cylon continuity (Deadlock).\n\nAs the Five recover from the tragedy of the miscarriage, Tory commiserates with the others, including a Tyrol desperate to save the life of Boomer, who was about to be transported for trial on the Baseship. She agrees with Ellen Tigh they cannot interfere with Cylon due process other than being witnesses. At Joe's Bar, Tory hears Kara Thrace playing the piano and recognizes the tune as the song switching on the Final Four in the nebula. She confronts Thrace to find out where she learned that song. Thrace informs her it was a song her father played for her as a child. Later off-screen she told them she was playing the music notes written as a drawing by Hera Agathon. By this time, Sharon Valerii had already abducted Hera and escaped back to Cavil's Baseship (Someone to Watch Over Me).\n\nTory continues to congregate with the Final Five, who are by now a close-knit group watching over their comatose member (Anders). However, the group temporarily loses Tyrol as he is imprisoned for his role in unwittingly allowing Valerii to kidnap Hera and escape. Ellen Tigh urges the Adamas to search for Hera on the Cylon Homeworld, and is emphatically supported by Anders's wife Kara Thrace. Tory abstains from voicing her own opinion on the matter, but she agrees with Ellen's recommendation and helps arrange the Heavy Raider reconnaissance mission after Adama gives his permission (Islanded in a Stream of Stars).\n\nTory reluctantly volunteers for the mission to rescue Hera, partially due to the insistence of Galen Tyrol. She assists Ellen in maintaining the link between Anders and \"Galactica\" during the battle. After agreeing to share resurrection technology with the Cylons in exchange for a truce, Tory becomes nervous the sharing process will involve a pooling of her memories with the rest of the Five, which will reveal the truth about the murder of Cally. Tory therefore asks the others to pledge that no matter what they find out about each other, they will forgive each other for it. Tigh agrees and the Five start the process, but when Tyrol sees her memory of murdering Cally he flies into a rage, breaks the download to strangle Tory, and ultimately snaps her neck in retribution. The Cylons of Cavil's faction see this as a betrayal since Tory's death broke the download and resume hostilities.\n\n"}

He liked her novel Tuck Everlasting and decided to produce and direct a film based on it. Filming was done in 1980 and was released on June 6, 1981. The film isn't well known, as most people associate \"Tuck Everlasting\" with the book or Tuck Everlasting (2002 film). However, the film can be found on VHS and rarely on DVD. It used to occasionally air on T.V.\n\nThe story involves the Tucks, a family who drank from a magic spring from the Fosters' little forest and became immortal (hence the name \"Tuck Everlasting\").\n\nDuring an autumn harvest carnival in the fictional town of Treegap at the turn of the century, somewhere in upstate New York, a young man named Jesse Tuck (Paul Flessa), who is immortal, is riding on the Ferris wheel where he works. He decides to show off the crowd by doing dangerous stunts. People begin to notice including a man in a yellow suit. The man who runs the Ferris wheel stops its motor, causing it to stop spinning which leaves Jesse on top. This makes a constable to threaten to charge the man if the boy gets hurt. Jesse begins doing dangerous stunts which frightens the crowd. The Ferris wheel's brake fails and when somebody bumps into it, it causes the wheel to turn causing Jesse to fall to the ground, causing people to think he is dead. After sitting, Jesse opens his eyes and jumps up, scaring the crowd. Angered the constable runs after Jesse.\n\nMeanwhile, a very, bored 12-year-old girl Winifred Foster (Margaret Chamberlain) is sitting on her front lawn. She is so bored that she begins talking to a turtle which goes waddling by. She tells the turtle how much she hates it at home, and that she is not allowed to go to the fair. Two boys talking about Jesse are walking by. After talking to the turtle her mother and Grandmother call her in for lunch and then to practice piano. She says goodbye to the turtle as it goes to hide in a bush.\n\nThe next scene shows the Tucks at their pond on the other side of the wood, at their brown one story house. Mae Tuck (Sonia Raimi) is talking to Angus Tuck (Fred A. Keller) but is called \"Angus\" only a couple of times throughout the whole movie. He is simply known as \"Tuck,\" or \"Mister Tuck.\" She asks him why he isn't waking up as it is already mid-morning. He says he likes sleeping as he dreams about he and his family are in heaven and never knew about Treegap. But she tells him he has to wake up to get the area ready as they will be having their ten-year reunion with their boys, Jesse and Miles, and that nothing is going to change. Still asleep, he tells her to put her shawl away as the weather hasn't changed. Tuck warns her about going into town or the woods. But she says otherwise. She then asks Tuck to fix her music box even though she is leaving in a few hours. He makes up excuses not to fix it but he agrees to fix it when she's back. She says she promised to keep it going as long as she lived. After Tuck asks what the boys have been doing, she then turns to talking about how fast time flies. And states 10 years is \"as long as it takes to make a pot of coffee.\" She is on her horse in the late afternoon admiring the mountains and grasslands and cornfields of the upper New York countryside. \n\nThe next scene shows a large beech tree with twisty branches. At the bottom of the trunk, underneath an opening, is a small bubbling spring less than a foot wide.\n\nMeanwhile, Winnie is allowed outside again, as her mom practices piano. She swings on her swing, which resembles a noose. She then looks at the bush the turtle hides in, and notices it covered with fireflies. She manages to catch one. The man in the yellow suit (James McGuire), the same man from the fair. He greets her and starts asking questions about fireflies but it then turns to questions about her personal life after she looses the firefly. After asking her if they have lived there long, she responds, they lived there forever.\n\nHer grandmother notices the man and comes out and asks the man what he is doing on their property. She hears the sound of Mae's music box but she's certain it's elves that live in the woods and come out every 10 years.\n\nIt's bedtime and Winnie is listening to her Grandmother telling Winnie's parents that it's the elves but her parents object. Father, Mr. Foster (Marvin Macnow) tells the Grandmother to cut it out because he doesn't want Winnie in the woods due to a murder which occurred there.\n\nThe next morning, Winnie's mother chases a bunch of rabbits away from her raspberry bush. The milk float for the town comes to their house. Winnie takes her chance to escape while mother and the milkman are talking about the elves and Tom Sullivan (the man who killed his wife in the wood.) She doesn't know that the man is watching her, as he had been hiding there overnight. She runs to the entrance of the wood and then walks slowly and admires the wildlife running around and listens to the birds chirp. She notices the large beech tree, and she sees Jesse in one of the branches. He notices her staring and jumps down. He then starts drinking out of that little spring under it. He notices a feather and picks it up. They notice each other and they begin talking, when Winnie wants a drink, he keeps pulling her back from it. After she asks how old he is, he says 104, but then says he's 17. She feels the water, noticing that it's clean and cold, but he interrupts saying it's terrible, and keeps her from drinking. She tries to drink it but he pulls her back and helps her climb the tree, as it's nice and cool. Mae is coming, with Miles, and still playing the music box. She recognizes it from that night. She says it's elf music but Jesse tells her it's just their mom. Winnie's Grandmother is not to far behind, so they grab Winnie and take her to their place. On the way there is the same man, but holding a pistol. Only Winnie knows the man exists, and so he starts asking the Tucks questions. He says the gun doesn't work and fires it at Miles. They both claim it was just a misfire even though he actually shot Miles. The man lies saying it's only a blank. On the way there, after crossing a bridge less river, Miles carries her across and Jesse shows off his immortality by jumping into a deep part of the river. After she begins panicking when he doesn't surface, Jesse scares her by putting his hand on her shoulder. Unknown to them, but the man was watching the whole entire time.\n\nThey go to the Tucks house where Tuck is outside working on his wooden horses. Tuck is surprised to see her and offers her to go swimming with the boys, which angers Mae. Winnie enjoys watching them play in the pond. Jesse tries to get Winnie to get into the water by splashing water. While Jesse and Winnie were playing, Miles, Mae and Tuck became increasingly worried about the man in the yellow suit.\n\nSince the Tucks don't have a dining area in their home, they eat supper in their den, Winnie gets lonely and asks to be taken home. They tell her their story. \n\nTuck says that 87 years ago, they came from the east, to find a place to live, and at the time, it was part of a large forest, and after a while of traveling they came to the area which is the now the wood. So they rested by the tree with it's knobby roots, they drank the water, even the horse, everybody except the cat, named \"Ginger.\" They later developed a farm, and a house, and began living a good life. But then when Jesse was getting rid of some branches but fell out of the tree and it was believed that he broke his neck. And then one night at sunset, hunters saw the house and they shot her, mistaking her for a deer. The bullet when right through and didn't even leave a mark. Tuck got bit by a copperhead, Jesse ate poison mushrooms, and Mae cut herself slicing bread. After making friends, they realized that they were not getting any older. Miles was then more than 40, had a wife and a daughter, but he still looked to be 25. Their friends began to leave them, there was talk of witchcraft and black magic. They were forced to leave the farm but later went back and they noticed the tree and the spring. The tree hadn't grown one width since they saw it, and realized it must've been the spring. Tuck then demonstrates b melting a spoon in a fireplace using his bare hand and making a ring out of it. \n\nEarly the next morning, Tuck takes Winnie out on a row boat out on the pond and tells her the dangers of selling the water, as somebody will most likely make it into a business, and just that little spring could create a world war.\n\nMeanwhile, the man is riding on the Tuck's horse to Winnie's house.\n\nWhile Tuck is giving good advice, he is interrupted when Miles yells that the horse had been stolen. They believe the man stole it, they ask Winnie and she tells them about the man asking questions and coming to her house but she couldn't finish as she begins crying into Tucks chest while he hugged her. Tuck says, \"I forgot what it was like being scared.\" Mae is up in the attic area where doves live, and so she \"uncorks the bender.\" Music begins to play and they dance around.\n\nMeanwhile, the man rides Tucks horse to the Fosters house where he makes a deal where he'll find Winnie with the constable and look for her if they give him the wood. They don't know why he wants it.\n\nBack at the Tucks, Winnie and Mae talk about Jesse and they have a \"woman to woman\" talk. Later that night, as Winnie's sleeping on the couch, Jesse wants her to drink the water when she's 17 so they can be with each other forever.\n\nThat night, the man and the constable are riding on different horses, the constable decides to stop and let his horse rest, the man decides to go on farther. The constable tells the man not to do anything.\n\nA bit later, Winnie is sleeping when she hears a noise and gets scared when woken up. She asks if it's Jesse when it's actually Mae again. Mae says, \"No, he's asleep, but dreaming of you I bet.\" Mae hums Hush, Little Baby to her.\n\nThe next morning there is a layer of snow on the ground. At breakfast time, Tuck begins to mention his concerns about the horse. Miles couldn't get any fish for flapjacks as the pond is to icy. Jesse comes down for breakfast and Tuck asks Winnie if she wants to come home but the man interrupts them, breaking the constables promise. He tells about how he was a little kid and was told tales about a family that would never die. Afterward. he pulls out his old pistol and pulls Winnie outside, threatening to make her drink the water and use her as a circus show and make the water a business, which Tuck warned about. He puts the gun to Winnie's head and threatens to kill her when Tuck comes with his double-barreled shotgun and shoots the man in the spine send him flying off of the hill and landing on a branch. The constable surprises them, and introduces himself as \"Constable Thomas.\" Tuck is arrested and put in the town jail. If the man survives, Tuck will be free, if he dies, then he will be sentenced to death by hanging. The next day Winnie is back home, but is only sitting sadly on her swing. They believe she's in shock and think she had a horrible experience.\n\nThe next morning, the milk wagon comes, and the milk man says the man died that night, and Tuck will be hung. As the carriage is leaving, Jesse jumps off the back, and when Winnie tells him, Jesse says they will break Tuck out of jail at Midnight.\n\nThat night, the grandfather clock chimes 12 and Jesse comes through the back window. They jump out of the window and run by foot to the sheriffs, using an ear of corn as a torch. They use Roman candles and firecrackers to distract the constable, as he deals with a group of teenagers who he believes are lynchers while the Tucks are busy at work. They replace Tuck with Winnie and they all say goodbye to her.\n\nThe next morning Winnie's father is directing her home and then they both apologize to each other. They notice a group of boys who Winnie becomes friends with later on.\n\nBack at home, Winnie is a few years older, and her grandmother is on her last legs, as all she's doing is sitting and knitting. The doorbell rings and a salesman is selling turtles for stew, Winnie notices one of the turtles and realizes that it's her turtle. She gets to keep it but the man warns her that if he finds it again, it will be made into stew. Winnie upset, runs upstairs to her room.\n\nWinnie, a teenager now is in a dry cornfield talking to the turtle, she still has a bottle of the spring water that Jesse gave to her and pours it all over the turtle, but then she realizes that if they do try to kill it and it doesn't work, then they'll wonder, so she puts it into the woods and hides it.\n\nThere is an epilogue at the end. It's the late 1970s and Mae and Tuck are driving a Late 1960s Chevy C/K and they are saddened and also surprised how much changed over the years. They decide to stop and ask where Winnie could. They drive through the modern day Treegap and stop at a diner and grab coffee. They ask the waitress behind the counter about the wood, she tells them that lightning destroyed the whole forest and was replaced by a bunch of houses. The waitress asks a customer who says last he heard when one of the sons became elected to Congress. They find a cemetery and find out that Winnie died in 1976. While sad that she had passed away, they were glad that she didn't drink the water. Jesse's working back at the carnival, now modern and meets a girl on a carousel named Katheryn Foster, most likely Winnie's granddaughter. Mae and Tuck get back into their truck when Tuck notices the turtle. He moves it while saying, \"Darn fool thing thinks it's gonna live forever.\" The movie ends with the truck driving away back east never to return. The last shot shows Winnie's turtle, watching the cars pass as the credits roll.\n\n\n\nMuch of the film was shot in Western upstate New York State, the ending was filmed in Medina, New York. The Adirondack Mountains can be seen in the background quite often. It was filmed from late summer 1980 to early spring 1981.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "161594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161594", "title": "Übermensch", "text": "Übermensch\n\nThe Übermensch (German for \"Beyond-Man\", \"Superman\", \"Overman\", \"Superhuman\", \"Hyperman\", \"Hyperhuman\"; ) is a concept in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. In his 1883 book \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" (), Nietzsche has his character Zarathustra posit the Übermensch as a goal for humanity to set for itself. It is a work of philosophical allegory, with a structural similarity to the Gathas of Zoroaster/Zarathustra.\n\nIn 1896, Alexander Tille made the first English translation of \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", rendering \"Übermensch\" as \"Beyond-Man\". In 1909, Thomas Common translated it as \"Superman\", following the terminology of George Bernard Shaw's 1903 stage play \"Man and Superman\". Walter Kaufmann lambasted this translation in the 1950s for two reasons: first, the failure of the English prefix \"super\" to capture the nuance of the German \"über\" (though in Latin, its meaning of \"above\" or \"beyond\" is closer to the German); and second, for promoting misidentification of Nietzsche's concept with the comic-book character Superman (whom Fredric Wertham described as \"un-American and fascist\"). Kaufmann and others preferred to translate \"Übermensch\" as \"overman\". Scholars continue to employ both terms, some simply opting to reproduce the German word.\n\nThe German prefix \"über\" can have connotations of superiority, transcendence, excessiveness, or intensity, depending on the words to which it is attached. \"Mensch\" refers to a human being, rather than a male specifically. The adjective \"übermenschlich\" means super-human: beyond human strength or out of proportion to humanity.\n\nNietzsche introduces the concept of the Übermensch in contrast to his understanding of the other-worldliness of Christianity: Zarathustra proclaims the will of the Übermensch to give meaning to life on earth, and admonishes his audience to ignore those who promise other-worldly fullfillment to draw them away from the earth. The turn away from the earth is prompted, he says, by a dissatisfaction with life that causes the sufferer to imagine another world which will fulfill his revenge. The Übermensch grasps the earthly world with relish and gratitude.\n\nZarathustra declares that the Christian escape from this world also required the invention of an immortal soul separate from the earthly body. This led to the abnegation and mortification of the body, or asceticism. Zarathustra further links the Übermensch to the body and to interpreting the soul as simply an aspect of the body.\n\nZarathustra ties the Übermensch to the death of God. While the concept of God was the ultimate expression of other-worldly values and their underlying instincts, belief in God nevertheless did give meaning to life for a time. \"God is dead\" means that the idea of God can no longer provide values. With the sole source of values exhausted, the danger of nihilism looms.\n\nZarathustra presents the Übermensch as the creator of new values to banish nihilism. If the Übermensch acts to create new values within the moral vacuum of nihilism, there is nothing that this creative act would not justify. Alternatively, in the absence of this creation, there are no grounds upon which to criticize or justify any action, including the particular values created and the means by which they are promulgated.\n\nIn order to avoid a relapse into Platonic idealism or asceticism, the creation of these new values cannot be motivated by the same instincts that gave birth to those tables of values. Instead, they must be motivated by a love of this world and of life. Whereas Nietzsche diagnosed the Christian value system as a reaction against life and hence destructive in a sense, the new values which the Übermensch will be responsible for will be life-affirming and creative (see Nietzschean affirmation).\n\nZarathustra first announces the Übermensch as a goal humanity can set for itself. All human life would be given meaning by how it advanced a new generation of human beings. The aspiration of a woman would be to give birth to an Übermensch, for example; her relationships with men would be judged by this standard.\n\nZarathustra contrasts the Übermensch with the degenerate last man of egalitarian modernity, an alternative goal which humanity might set for itself. The last man appears only in \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", and is presented as a smothering of aspiration antithetical to the sprit of the Übermensch.\n\nAccording to Rüdiger Safranski, some commentators associate the Übermensch with a program of eugenics. This is most pronounced when considered in the aspect of a goal that humanity sets for itself. The reduction of all psychology to physiology implies, to some, that human beings can be bred for cultural traits. This interpretation of Nietzsche's doctrine focuses more on the future of humanity than on a single cataclysmic individual. There is no consensus regarding how this aspect of the Übermensch relates to the creation of new values.\n\nFor Rüdiger Safranski, the Übermensch represents a higher biological type reached through artificial selection and at the same time is also an ideal for anyone who is creative and strong enough to master the whole spectrum of human potential, good and \"evil\", to become an \"artist-tyrant\". In \"Ecce Homo\", Nietzsche vehemently denied any idealistic, democratic or humanitarian interpretation of the Übermensch: \"The word Übermensch [designates] a type of supreme achievement, as opposed to 'modern' men, 'good' men, Christians, and other nihilists ... When I whispered into the ears of some people that they were better off looking for a Cesare Borgia than a Parsifal, they did not believe their ears.\" Safranski argues that the combination of ruthless warrior pride and artistic brilliance that defined the Italian Renaissance embodied the sense of the Übermensch for Nietzsche. According to Safranski, Nietzsche intended the ultra-aristocratic figure of the Übermensch to serve as a Machiavellian bogeyman of the modern Western middle class and its pseudo-Christian egalitarian value system.\n\nThe Übermensch shares a place of prominence in \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" with another of Nietzsche's key concepts: the eternal recurrence of the same. Several interpretations for this fact have been offered.\n\nLaurence Lampert suggests that the eternal recurrence replaces the Übermensch as the object of serious aspiration. This is in part due to the fact that even the Übermensch can appear like an other-worldly hope. The Übermensch lies in the future — no historical figures have ever been Übermenschen — and so still represents a sort of eschatological redemption in some future time.\n\nStanley Rosen, on the other hand, suggests that the doctrine of eternal return is an esoteric ruse meant to save the concept of the Übermensch from the charge of Idealism. Rather than positing an as-yet unexperienced perfection, Nietzsche would be the prophet of something that has occurred a countless number of times in the past.\n\nOthers maintain that willing the eternal recurrence of the same is a necessary step if the Übermensch is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. Therefore, it could seem that the Übermensch, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism.\n\nStill others suggest that one must have the strength of the Übermensch in order to will the eternal recurrence of the same; that is, only the Übermensch will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.\n\nThe term Übermensch was used frequently by Hitler and the Nazi regime to describe their idea of a biologically superior Aryan or Germanic master race; a racial version of Nietzsche's Übermensch became a philosophical foundation for National Socialist ideas. The Nazi notion of the master race also spawned the idea of \"inferior humans\" (\"Untermenschen\") who should be dominated and enslaved; this term does not originate with Nietzsche, who was critical of both antisemitism and German nationalism. In his final years, Nietzsche began to believe that he was in fact Polish, not German, and was quoted as saying, \"I am a pure-blooded Polish nobleman, without a single drop of bad blood, certainly not German blood\". In defiance of nationalist doctrines, he claimed that he and Germany were great only because of \"Polish blood in their veins\", and that he would be \"having all anti-semites shot\" as an answer to his stance on anti-semitism. Nietzsche died long before Hitler's reign, and it was partly Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche who manipulated her brother's words to accommodate the worldview of herself and her husband, Bernhard Förster, a prominent German nationalist and antisemite. Forster founded the \"Deutscher Volksverein\" (German People's League) in 1881 with Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg.\n\nThe thought of Nietzsche had an important influence anarchist authors. Spencer Sunshine writes: \"There were many things that drew anarchists to Nietzsche: his hatred of the state; his disgust for the mindless social behavior of 'herds'; his anti-Christianity; his distrust of the effect of both the market and the State on cultural production; his desire for an 'overman' — that is, for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave; his praise of the ecstatic and creative self, with the artist as his prototype, who could say, 'Yes' to the self-creation of a new world on the basis of nothing; and his forwarding of the 'transvaluation of values' as source of change, as opposed to a Marxist conception of class struggle and the dialectic of a linear history.\" The influential American anarchist Emma Goldman, in the preface of her famous collection \"Anarchism and Other Essays\", defends both Nietzsche and Max Stirner from attacks within anarchism when she says \"The most disheartening tendency common among readers is to tear out one sentence from a work, as a criterion of the writer's ideas or personality. Friedrich Nietzsche, for instance, is decried as a hater of the weak because he believed in the Übermensch. It does not occur to the shallow interpreters of that giant mind that this vision of the Übermensch also called for a state of society which will not give birth to a race of weaklings and slaves.\"\n\nSunshine says that the \"Spanish anarchists also mixed their class politics with Nietzschean inspiration.\" Murray Bookchin, in \"The Spanish Anarchists\", describes prominent CNT–FAI member Salvador Seguí as \"an admirer of Nietzschean individualism, of the \"superhombre\" to whom 'all is permitted'.\" Bookchin, in his 1973 introduction to Sam Dolgoff's \"The Anarchist Collectives\", even describes the reconstruction of society by the workers as a Nietzschean project. Bookchin says that \"workers must see themselves as human beings, not as class beings; as creative personalities, not as 'proletarians,' as self-affirming individuals, not as 'masses'. . .(the) economic component must be humanized precisely by bringing an 'affinity of friendship' to the work process, by diminishing the role of onerous work in the lives of producers, indeed by a total 'transvaluation of values' (to use Nietzsche's phrase) as it applies to production and consumption as well as social and personal life.\"\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
